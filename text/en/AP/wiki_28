<text>Peter Case (born April 5, 1954) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. His career is wide-ranging, from rock n&#x27; roll and blues, to folk rock and solo acoustic performance.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Case was born in Buffalo, New York and lived in nearby Hamburg, New York. He wrote his first song &quot;Stay Away,&quot; in 1965, at the age of eleven. A veteran of several rock bands and the local bar scene as a teenager, Case dropped out of high school when he was fifteen (he would later earn a GED), and after several years of traveling arrived in 1973 in San Francisco, where he performed as a street musician. During this period a documentary about the local music scene, &quot;Nightshift,&quot; directed by Bert Deivert, captured the young Case on film. In 1976, he teamed up with Jack Lee and Paul Collins to form the early punk-era band The Nerves in San Francisco. The group&#x27;s 1976 EP track, &quot;Hanging on the Telephone&quot;, was later recorded by Blondie.

The Nerves moved to Los Angeles on January 1, 1977, and played and promoted some of the first punk-era shows in that city, performing at The Masque, and the Whisky a Go Go, among other venues. They toured nationally in 1977, the first independent band of their era to do a national tour, as they opened shows for the Ramones, and Mink DeVille, and performed on co-bills with The Nuns, Devo, and Pere Ubu.

After the Nerves broke up in 1978, Case formed the rock n&#x27; roll band The Plimsouls in 1979. The Plimsouls became one of the top drawing live bands in California soon after the release of their debut EP &quot;Zero Hour&quot; on the Beat Records label in 1979. They grew in popularity and had two major label albums, the first on Planet/Elektra in 1981, and the next on Geffen Records, in 1983. In 1982, &quot;A Million Miles Away&quot; was released as a 12&quot; single, on the Shaky City/Bomp! label, and became the band&#x27;s signature song. It was a radio hit in California, and some other regions of the U.S. It eventually charted at number 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Their songs &quot;A Million Miles Away,&quot; &quot;The Oldest Story in the World,&quot; and &quot;Everywhere At Once&quot; were included in the movie &quot;Valley Girl&quot; (1983), but by the time that movie had become a cult favorite, the group had broken up.

Case briefly performed with Gurf Morlix, Victoria Williams (Case&#x27;s first wife), and Warren Tornado Klein as the Incredibly Strung Out Band, but their collaboration never resulted in a record. 

===Solo career===

Case struck out on his own with the self-titled album Peter Case released in 1986 on Geffen Records. Produced by T Bone Burnett and Mitchell Froom, the record included three songs co-written by Burnett and one by Victoria Williams, and also featured the talents of Williams, Morlix, Klein, Mike Campbell (of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers), John Hiatt, Jim Keltner, Jerry Marotta, Roger McGuinn (of The Byrds), and Van Dyke Parks, among others. One of the songs on the album, &quot;Old Blue Car,&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award. Robert Palmer chose the album as the No. 1 release for 1986 in his year-in-review wrap-up for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 1989, Case released a second solo album, &quot;The Man With the Blue Post-Modern Fragmented Neo-Traditionalist Guitar,&quot; this time with the help of artists like David Hidalgo of Los Lobos, Ry Cooder, and Benmont Tench. While not a major commercial success, the album was a favorite of critics and other musicians: Bruce Springsteen told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that he was listening to Peter Case more than anyone else that year.

In 1992, Case scored a radio hit with the song &quot;Dream About You&quot; which peaked at #16 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock charts. After a third album for Geffen, &quot;Six-Pack of Love,&quot; Case recorded a live-in-the-studio album of cover versions of folk, blues, and country songs, &quot;Peter Case Sings Like Hell,&quot; which was released on Case&#x27;s own Travelin&#x27; Light label. Case signed a contract with Vanguard Records, and the record was re-released on that label in 1993. His next Vanguard record, &quot;Torn Again,&quot; was issued in 1995, and features Case with a band including the rhythm section of Don Heffington and Jerry Scheff, with Greg Leisz on guitar.

In 1996, the Plimsouls reunited for the first of several reunions. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Case continued to release albums as a solo performer, moving in an increasingly acoustic-oriented direction, and playing clubs and small venues. &quot;Torn Again&quot; was followed by &quot;Full Service No Waiting&quot; (1998), &quot;Flying Saucer Blues&quot; (2000), and &quot;Beeline&quot; (2002) all on Vanguard, in addition to &quot;Thank You St. Jude&quot; (2001), a self-released CD that featured David Perales on fiddle and background vocals. In a review of &quot;Flying Saucer Blues,&quot; critic Bill Wasserzieher declared, &quot;I am convinced that nobody of Case&#x27;s generation writes better songs or does better work in the tradition of Woody Guthrie.&quot;

In 2004 Vanguard released &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Go Your Crooked Mile,&quot; a compilation of tracks from his albums for the label, which also included two previously unrecorded songs, &quot;Wake Up Call&quot; and &quot;My Generation&#x27;s Golden Handcuff Blues&quot;. Both tracks gave evidence of Case&#x27;s strongly held political convictions.

In the late 1990s, he curated the musical program for the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. In 2001, he organized, produced, and performed on &quot;Avalon Blues,&quot; a tribute album to blues music pioneer Mississippi John Hurt, which was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album. Case also performed Beatles songs at the Hollywood Bowl with George Martin. Case&#x27;s solo performances have featured his own compositions as well as covers of songs by Memphis Minnie, Sleepy John Estes, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and others. He frequently conducts songwriting workshops in California, where he now resides, and in other locations.

In February 2006, Hungry for Music, a non-profit organization based in Washington, DC, released a three-disc tribute to Case, entitled &quot;A Case for Case;&quot; the set featured cover versions of Case&#x27;s songs performed by various artists, including John Prine, Susan Cowsill, Joe Ely, Dave Alvin, Maura O&#x27;Connell and others.

In 2006 Case began posting on his blog sections of a memoir entitled &quot;As Far As You Can Get Without a Passport,&quot; which was subsequently issued in book form in January 2007 by Everthemore Books. The memoir covers Case&#x27;s very early days from the time he left his native upstate New York and wound up singing and playing on the streets of San Francisco. This period inspired some of his most memorable songs, including &quot;Entella Hotel &quot;and &quot;Travellin&#x27; Light.&quot; John Doe, co-founder of the Los Angeles punk band X, contributed an introduction to the book. Case has continued to write and post autobiographical additional material.

On December 6, 2007, Case&#x27;s &quot;Let Us Now Praise Sleepy John&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album. The record was produced by Ian Brennan. The album featured &quot;Every 24 Hours,&quot; a duet with Richard Thompson on harmony vocals and guitar, and &quot;That Soul Twist,&quot; a duet with Merle Haggard pedal-steel man Norm Hamlet.

In January 2009, Case underwent heart surgery, leading to fund raising efforts by other musicians to help defray his medical costs. Case&#x27;s next project, &quot;Wig!&quot;, a CD/LP was released on June 29, 2010, by Yep Roc Records. The record was an interpretation of electric blues, and featured D.J. Bonebrake on drums, and Memphis musician Ron Franklin on slide guitar and electric piano. Case and Franklin composed a number of the songs the day before the sessions, which lasted three days.

In 2012, &quot;The Case Files,&quot; a compilation of &quot;studio out-takes, demos, and live shots,&quot; was released by Alive Naturalsound Records. This record included two 1985 demos made with T Bone Burnett, some spoken word pieces with music from a longer piece called &quot;Bomblight Prayer Vigil,&quot; and various other Case rarities.

In December 2014, Case went into the Carriage House studio in Los Angeles, and recorded &quot;HWY 62,&quot; an LP of new original songs, with a band including Ben Harper on lead guitar, D.J. Bonebrake of X, on drums, keyboardist Jebin Bruni, and bassist David Carpenter. The album was released in 2015.

September 2016 saw the re-release of his debut solo album expanded with 7 extra tracks.

In December 2019, Case went to The Old Whaling Church in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and recorded with producer Ron Franklin,&quot;The Midnight Broadcast,&quot; a concept album of traditional and contemporary material featuring Cindy Wasserman (vocals), Bert Deivert (mandolin, drums), Lee Fortier (harmonica, vocals) Franklin (moog, maracas) and Ross Johnson (as the DJ). Mixed by Boo Mitchell at Royal Recorders in Memphis, the album was released in 2021.

==Reunion tribute tour==
In 2012, longtime musical partners Case and Paul Collins announced a reunion tour paying tribute to their groups The Nerves, The Breakaways, The Beat and The Plimsouls. The touring band line-up for the Collins and Case tour was augmented by members of The Paul Collins Beat (Timm Buechler, bass, and Amos Pitsch of Tenement, drums, and Tim Schweiger, a veteran musician). According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Music Blog of March 22, 2012, the tour &quot;fell apart&quot; early due to &quot;musical differences&quot;.

<text>Amber or Amer, is a city near Jaipur city in Jaipur district in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is now a part of the Jaipur Municipal Corporation.

The picturesque situation of Amber at the mouth of a rocky mountain gorge, in which nestles a lake, has attracted the admiration of travellers, including Victor Jacquemont and Reginald Heber. It is seen to be a remarkable example for its combined Rajput-Mughal architecture. The Amber Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the top tourist attraction in the Jaipur area.

==History==
Amber was a Meena state that replaced Khoh as the capital of Dhundhar after Kakil Deo, the son of Dulha Rai, defeated the Meenas.

The state of Jaipur was earlier known as Amber or Dhundhar and was controlled by Meena chiefs of five different tribes who were under suzerainty of the Bargurjar Rajput Raja of Deoti. Later a Kachhwaha prince Dulha Rai destroyed the sovereignty of Meenas and also defeated Bargurjars of Deoli and took Dhundhar fully under Kachwaha rule.

Much of the present structure known as Amber Fort is actually the palace built by Mughal Emperor Akbar&#x27;s Navaratnas Raja Man Singh I who ruled from 1590 to 1614 AD. The palace includes several spectacular buildings, such as the Diwan-i-Khas, and the elaborately painted Ganesh Pole built by the renowned warlord Mirza Raja Jai Singh I (Man Singh I&#x27;s grandson). The old and original fort of Amber, dating from earlier Rajas or the Mair or Maidh period, is what is known in the present day as Jaigarh Fort, which was actually the main defensive structure rather than the palace itself. The two structures are interconnected by a series of encompassing fortifications.

Amber was capital of the Kachwaha until 1727 when the ruler of Amber, Sawai Jai Singh II founded a capital Jainagara (Jaipur), named after him, about nine kilometers south of Amber. After the founding of this new town, the royal palace and houses of prominent persons were shifted to Jaipur. The priests of Shila Devi temple, who were Bengali Brahmins, continued to live in the fort (to this date), while the Jaigarh fort above the palace also remained heavily garrisoned. The capital of Kachwaha was supplanted by the modern city of Jaipur, which is the capital of the Rajasthan state in India.

===Controversy over renovation practices===
Poor site management and development pressures have dramatically altered the historical integrity of Amber. The building that rings around the Jaleb Chwok courtyard &quot;has been converted to a market place with shops selling showpieces and dresses. They have cafeterias, cyber cafés, etc.&quot;, according to the Times of India. In the summer of 2009, the Rajasthan High Court launched a three-member panel charged with investigating the controversial renovations and determining to what extent the cultural heritage of the site was compromised.

<text>John F. Kennedy International Airport is a major international airport serving New York City and its metropolitan area. JFK Airport is located on the southwestern shore of Long Island, in Queens, New York City, bordering Jamaica Bay. It is the busiest of the seven airports in the New York airport system, the sixth-busiest airport in the United States, and the busiest international commercial airport in North America. The airport, which covers , is the largest in the New York metropolitan area. Over 90 airlines operate from JFK Airport, with nonstop or direct flights to destinations on all six inhabited continents.

JFK Airport is located in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, southeast of Midtown Manhattan. The airport features five passenger terminals and four runways. It is primarily accessible via car, bus, shuttle, or other vehicle transit via the JFK Expressway or Interstate 678 (Van Wyck Expressway), or by train. JFK is a hub for American Airlines and Delta Air Lines as well as the primary operating base for JetBlue. The airport is also a former hub for Braniff, Eastern, Flying Tigers, National, Northeast, Northwest, Pan Am, Seaboard World, Tower Air, and TWA.
The facility opened in 1948 as New York International Airport and was commonly known as Idlewild Airport. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, the airport was renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport in tribute to him.

== History ==
=== Construction ===
What would become known as John F. Kennedy International Airport opened in 1948 as New York International Airport though it was commonly known as Idlewild Airport. after the Idlewild Beach Golf Course that it displaced. It was built to relieve LaGuardia Field, which had become overcrowded after its 1939 opening. In late 1941, mayor Fiorello La Guardia announced that the city had tentatively chosen a large area of marshland on Jamaica Bay, which included the Idlewild Golf Course as well as a summer hotel and a landing strip called the Jamaica Sea-Airport, for a new airfield. Title to the land was conveyed to the city at the end of December 1941. Construction began in 1943, though the airport&#x27;s final layout was not yet decided upon.

About US$60 million was initially spent with governmental funding, but only of the Idlewild Golf Course site were earmarked for use. The project was renamed Major General Alexander E. Anderson Airport in 1943 after a Queens resident who had commanded a Federalized National Guard unit in the southern United States and died in late 1942. The renaming was vetoed by Mayor La Guardia and reinstated by the New York City Council; in common usage, the airport was still called &quot;Idlewild&quot;. In 1944, the New York City Board of Estimate authorized the condemnation of another for Idlewild. The Port of New York Authority (now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey) leased the Idlewild property from the City of New York in 1947 and maintains this lease today. In March 1948, the City Council changed the official name to New York International Airport, Anderson Field, but the common name remained &quot;Idlewild&quot; until December 24, 1963. The airport was intended as the world&#x27;s largest and most efficient, with &quot;no confusion and no congestion&quot;.

=== Early operations ===

The first flight from Idlewild was on July 1, 1948, with the opening ceremony attended by U.S. President Harry S. Truman and Governor of New York Thomas E. Dewey, who were both running for president in that year&#x27;s presidential election. The Port Authority cancelled foreign airlines&#x27; permits to use LaGuardia, forcing them to move to Idlewild during the next couple of years. Idlewild at the time had a single terminal building; by 1949, the terminal building was being expanded to . Further expansions would come in following years, including a control tower in 1952, as well as new and expanded buildings and taxiways.

Idlewild opened with six runways and a seventh under construction; runways 1L and 7L were held in reserve and never came into use as runways. Runway 31R (originally ) is still in use; runway 31L (originally ) opened soon after the rest of the airport and is still in use; runway 1R closed in 1957 and runway 7R closed around 1966. Runway 4 (originally 8,000 ft, now runway 4L) opened June 1949 and runway 4R was added ten years later. A smaller runway 14/32 was built after runway 7R closed and was used until 1990 by general aviation, STOL, and smaller commuter flights.

The first jet airliner to land at Idlewild was an Avro Jetliner flying from Malton Airport in Toronto carrying the world&#x27;s first cargo of jet airmail on April 18, 1950. A 1951 policy instituted by the Port Authority effectively prohibited jets from landing at the city&#x27;s airports. After tests demonstrating that it was no noisier than the loudest of the then-current propeller plane, approval was granted for a Sud Aviation Caravelle prototype to be the next jet airliner to land at Idlewild, on May 2, 1957. Later in 1957, the Soviet Union sought approval for two jet-powered Tupolev Tu-104 flights carrying diplomats to land at Idlewild; the Port Authority did not allow them, saying noise tests had to be done first.

In 1951, the airport averaged 73 daily airline operations (takeoffs plus landings); the October 1951 &quot;Airline Guide&quot; shows nine domestic departures a day on National and Northwest. Much of Newark Airport&#x27;s traffic shifted to Idlewild (which averaged 242 daily airline operations in 1952) when Newark was temporarily closed in February 1952 after a series of three plane crashes in the two preceding months in Elizabeth, all of which had fatalities; flights were shifted to Idlewild and La Guardia, which were both able to have planes take off and land over the water, rather than over the densely populated areas surrounding Newark Airport. The airport remained closed in Newark until November 1952, with new flight patterns that took planes away from Elizabeth. L-1049 Constellations and DC-7s appeared between 1951 and 1953 and did not use LaGuardia for their first several years, bringing more traffic to Idlewild. The April 1957 &quot;Airline Guide&quot; cites a total of 1,283 departures a week, including about 250 from Eastern Air Lines, 150 from National Airlines and 130 from Pan American.

=== Separate terminals ===
By 1954, Idlewild had the highest volume of international air traffic of any airport globally. The Port of New York Authority originally planned a single 55-gate terminal, but the major airlines did not agree with this plan, arguing that the terminal would be far too small for future traffic. Architect Wallace Harrison then designed a plan for each major airline at the airport to be given its own space to develop its own terminal. This scheme made construction more practical, made terminals more navigable, and introduced incentives for airlines to compete with each other for the best design. The revised plan met airline approval in 1955, with seven terminals initially planned. Five terminals were for individual airlines, one was for three airlines, and one was for international arrivals (National Airlines and British Airways arrived later). In addition, there would be an 11-story control tower, roadways, parking lots, taxiways, and a reflecting lagoon in the center. The airport was designed for aircraft up to gross weight The airport had to be modified in the late 1960s to accommodate the Boeing 747&#x27;s weight.

The International Arrivals Building, or IAB, was the first new terminal at the airport, opening in December 1957. The building was designed by SOM. The terminal stretched nearly and was parallel to runway 7R. The terminal had &quot;finger&quot; piers at right angles to the main building allowing more aircraft to park, an innovation at the time. The building was expanded in 1970 to accommodate jetways. However, by the 1990s the overcrowded building was showing its age and it did not provide adequate space for security checkpoints. It was demolished in 2000 and replaced with Terminal 4.

United Airlines and Delta Air Lines opened Terminal 7 (later renumbered Terminal 9), a SOM design similar to the IAB, in October 1959. It was demolished in 2008.

Eastern Air Lines opened their Chester L. Churchill-designed Terminal 1 in November 1959. The terminal was demolished in 1995 and replaced with the current Terminal 1.

American Airlines opened Terminal 8 in February 1960. It was designed by Kahn and Jacobs and had a stained-glass facade designed by Robert Sowers, the largest stained-glass installation in the world until 1979. The facade was removed in 2007 as the terminal was demolished to make room for the new Terminal 8; American cited the prohibitive cost of removing the enormous installation.

Pan American World Airways opened the Worldport (later Terminal 3) in 1960, designed by Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton. It featured a large, elliptical roof suspended by 32 sets of radial posts and cables; the roof extended beyond the base of the terminal to cover the passenger loading area. It was one of the first airline terminals in the world to feature jetways that connected to the terminal and that could be moved to provide an easy walkway for passengers from the terminal to a docked aircraft. Jetways replaced the need to have to board the plane outside via airstairs that descend from an aircraft, truck-mounted mobile stairs, or wheeled stairs. The Worldport was demolished in 2013.

Trans World Airlines opened the TWA Flight Center in 1962, designed by Eero Saarinen with a distinctive winged-bird shape. With the demise of TWA in 2001, the terminal remained vacant until 2005 when JetBlue and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) financed the construction of a new 26-gate terminal partly encircling the Saarinen building. Called Terminal 5 (Now T5), the new terminal opened on October 22, 2008. T5 is connected to the Saarinen central building through the original passenger departure-arrival tubes that connected the building to the outlying gates. The original Saarinen terminal, also known as the head house, has since been converted into the TWA Hotel.

Northwest Orient, Braniff International Airways, and Northeast Airlines opened a joint terminal in November 1962 (later Terminal 2). It was demolished in 2023 to make way for a new Terminal 1.

National Airlines opened the Sundrome (later Terminal 6) in 1969. The terminal was designed by I.M.Pei. It was unique for its use of all-glass mullions dividing the window sections, unprecedented at the time. On October 30, 2000, United Airlines and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced plans to redevelop this terminal and the TWA Flight Center as a new United terminal. Terminal 6 was used by JetBlue from 2001 until JetBlue moved to Terminal 5 in 2008. The Sundrome was demolished in October 2011 to make room for additional gates at JetBlue&#x27;s Terminal 5.

=== Later operation ===
The airport was renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport on December 24, 1963, a month and two days after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. proposed the renaming. The IDL and KIDL codes have since been reassigned to Indianola Municipal Airport in Mississippi, and the now-renamed Kennedy Airport was given the codes JFK and KJFK, the fallen president&#x27;s initials.

Airlines began scheduling jets to Idlewild in 1958–59; LaGuardia did not get jets until 1964, and JFK became New York&#x27;s busiest airport. It had more airline takeoffs and landings than LaGuardia and Newark combined from 1962 to 1967 and was the second-busiest airport in the country, peaking at 403,981 airline operations in 1967. LaGuardia received a new terminal and longer runways from 1960 to 1966. By the mid-1970s, the two airports had roughly equal airline traffic (by flight count); Newark was in third place until the 1980s, except during LaGuardia&#x27;s reconstruction. Concorde, operated by Air France and British Airways, made scheduled trans-Atlantic supersonic flights to JFK from November 22, 1977, until its retirement by British Airways on October 24, 2003. Air France had retired the aircraft in May 2003.

Construction of the AirTrain JFK people-mover system began in 1998, after decades of planning for a direct rail link to the airport. Although the system was originally scheduled to open in 2002, it opened on December 17, 2003, after delays caused by construction and a fatal crash. The rail network links each airport terminal to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road at Howard Beach and Jamaica.

The airport&#x27;s new Terminal 1 opened on May 28, 1998; Terminal 4, the $1.4 billion replacement for the International Arrivals Building, opened on May 24, 2001. JetBlue&#x27;s Terminal 5 incorporates the TWA Flight Center, and Terminals 8 and 9 were demolished and rebuilt as Terminal 8 for the American Airlines hub. The Port Authority Board of Commissioners approved a $20 million planning study for the redevelopment of Terminals 2 and 3, the Delta Air Lines hub, in 2008.

On March 19, 2007, JFK was the first airport in the United States to receive a passenger Airbus A380 flight. The route, with an over-500-passenger capacity, was operated by Lufthansa and Airbus and arrived at Terminal 1. On August 1, 2008, it received the first regularly scheduled commercial A380 flight to the United States (on Emirates&#x27; New York–Dubai route) at Terminal 4. Although the service was suspended in 2009 due to poor demand, the aircraft was reintroduced in November 2010. Airlines operating A380s to JFK include Singapore Airlines (on its New York–Frankfurt–Singapore route), Lufthansa (on its New York–Frankfurt route), Korean Air (on its New York–Seoul route), Asiana Airlines (on its New York–Seoul route), Etihad Airways (on its New York–Abu Dhabi route), and Emirates (on its New York–Milan–Dubai and New York–Dubai routes). On December 8, 2015, JFK was the first U.S. airport to receive a commercial Airbus A350 flight when Qatar Airways began using the aircraft on one of its New York–Doha routes.

The airport currently hosts the world&#x27;s longest flight, Singapore Airlines Flights 23 and 24 (SQ23 and SQ24). The route was launched in 2020 between Singapore and New York JFK, and uses the Airbus A350-900ULR.

=== Major robberies ===

The Air France robbery took place in April 1967 when associates of the Lucchese crime family stole $420,000 (equivalent of approximately $ million in 2024) from the Air France cargo terminal at the airport. It was the largest cash robbery in the United States at the time. It was carried out by Henry Hill, Robert McMahon, Tommy DeSimone and Montague Montemurro, on a tip-off from McMahon. Hill believed it was the Air France robbery that endeared him to the Mafia.

Air France was contracted to transport American currency that had been exchanged in Southeast Asia for deposit in the United States. Their aircraft regularly delivered three or four $60,000 packages at a time. Hill and associates obtained a key to a cement block strong room where the money was stored. They entered the unsecured cargo terminal and entered the strong room unchallenged. They took seven bags in a large suitcase. The theft was not discovered until the following Monday.

The Lufthansa heist took place on December 11, 1978, at the airport. The robbery netted an estimated US$5.875 million (equivalent to US$ million in ), including US$5 million in cash and US$875,000 in jewelry. It was the largest cash robbery committed on American soil at the time.

James Burke, an associate of the Lucchese crime family of New York, was believed to be the mastermind behind the robbery, but was never charged with the crime. Burke is also alleged to have either committed or ordered the murders of many in the robbery, both to avoid being implicated in the heist and to keep their shares of the money for himself. The only person convicted in the Lufthansa heist was Louis Werner, an airport worker involved with the planning.

The money and jewellery have never been recovered. The heist&#x27;s magnitude made it one of the longest-investigated crimes in U.S. history; the latest arrest associated with the robbery was made in 2014, which resulted in acquittal.

== Access ==
=== Rail ===
All lines of AirTrain JFK, the airport&#x27;s dedicated rail network, stop at each passenger terminal. The system also serves Federal Circle, the JFK long-term parking lot, and two multimodal rapid transit stations: Howard Beach and Jamaica. While AirTrain travel within airport property is complimentary, external transfers at the latter two locations are paid via OMNY or MetroCard and provide access to the New York City Subway, Long Island Rail Road, and MTA Bus services.

=== Bus ===
, only the bus serves Terminal 8. The serve JFK&#x27;s cargo terminals. The Q10 and B15 serve the Lefferts Boulevard station on the AirTrain and it includes a free transfer. The B15, Q3, and Q10 buses will return to Terminal 5 in 2026 due to construction. Bus fares are paid via OMNY or MetroCard, with free transfers provided to New York City Subway services.

=== Vehicle ===
Vehicles primarily access the airport via the Van Wyck Expressway (I-678) or JFK Expressway, both of which are connected to the Belt Parkway and various surface streets in South Ozone Park and Springfield Gardens. The airport operates parking facilities consisting of multi-level terminal garages, surface spaces in the Central Terminal Area, and a long-term parking lot with total accommodation for more than 17,000 vehicles. A travel plaza on airport property also contains a food court, filling station, and originally four Tesla Superchargers. The original 4 Tesla Superchargers were later replaced with a new station with 12 stalls.

Taxis and other for-hire vehicles (FHV) serving JFK are licensed by the New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission. In 2019, PANYNJ approved the implementation of &quot;airport access fee&quot; surcharges on FHV and taxi trips, with the revenue earmarked to support the agency&#x27;s capital programs.

== Terminals ==
=== Overview ===

JFK has five active terminals, containing 130 gates in total. The terminals are numbered 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8.

The terminal buildings, except for the former Tower Air terminal, are arranged in a deformed U-shaped wavy pattern around a central area containing parking, a power plant, and other airport facilities. The terminals are connected by the AirTrain system and access roads. Directional signage throughout the terminals was designed by Paul Mijksenaar. A 2006 survey by J.D. Power and Associates in conjunction with &quot;Aviation Week&quot; found that JFK ranked second in overall traveller satisfaction among large airports in the United States, behind Harry Reid International Airport, which serves the Las Vegas metropolitan area.

Until the early 1990s, each terminal was known by the primary airline that served it, except for Terminal 4, which was known as the International Arrivals Building. In the early 1990s, all terminals were given numbers except for the Tower Air terminal, which sat outside the Central Terminals area and was not numbered. Like the other airports controlled by the Port Authority, JFK&#x27;s terminals are sometimes managed and maintained by independent terminal operators. At JFK, all terminals are managed by airlines or consortiums of the airlines serving them, except for the Schiphol Group-operated Terminal 4. All terminals can handle international arrivals that are not pre-cleared.

Most inter-terminal connections require passengers to exit security, then walk, use a shuttle bus, or use the AirTrain JFK to get to the other terminal, then re-clear security.

=== Terminal 1 ===

Terminal 1 opened in 1998, 50 years after the opening of JFK, at the direction of the Terminal One Group, a consortium of four key operating carriers: Air France, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, and Lufthansa. This partnership was founded after the four airlines reached an agreement that the then-existing international carrier facilities were inadequate for their needs. The Eastern Air Lines terminal was located on the site of present-day Terminal 1.

Terminal 1 is served by SkyTeam carriers Air France, China Eastern Airlines, Korean Air, Saudia, and Scandinavian Airlines; Star Alliance carriers Air China, Air New Zealand, Asiana Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Egyptair, EVA Air, Lufthansa, Swiss International Air Lines, TAP Air Portugal, and Turkish Airlines; and Oneworld carrier Royal Air Maroc. Other airlines serving Terminal 1 include Air Serbia, Azores Airlines, Cayman Airways, Flair Airlines, ITA Airways, Neos, Philippine Airlines, Viva, and Volaris.

Terminal 1 was designed by William Nicholas Bodouva + Associates. It and Terminal 4 are the two terminals at JFK Airport with the capability of handling the Airbus A380 aircraft, which Korean Air flies on the route from Seoul–Incheon and Lufthansa from Munich. Air France operated Concorde here until 2003. Terminal 1 has 11 gates.

=== Terminal 4 ===
Terminal 4, developed by LCOR, Inc., is managed by JFKIAT (IAT) LLC, a subsidiary of the Schiphol Group and was the first in the United States to be managed by a foreign airport operator. Terminal 4 currently contains 48 gates in two concourses and functions as the hub for Delta Air Lines at JFK.

* Concourse A (gates A2–A12, A14–A17, A19, and A21) serves primarily Asian and some European airlines along with Delta Connection flights. 
* Concourse B (gates B20, B22-B55) primarily serves both domestic and international flights of Delta and its SkyTeam partners.

Airlines servicing Terminal 4 include SkyTeam carriers Aeromexico, Air Europa, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Kenya Airways, KLM, Virgin Atlantic, and XiamenAir; Star Alliance carriers Air India, Avianca, Copa Airlines, and Singapore Airlines; and non-alliance carriers Arkia, Caribbean Airlines, El Al, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue (late night international arrivals only), LATAM Brasil, LATAM Chile, LATAM Peru, Uzbekistan Airways, and WestJet. Like Terminal 1, the facility is Airbus A380-compatible with service currently provided by Emirates to Dubai (both non-stop and one-stop via Milan), and Etihad Airways to Abu Dhabi.

Opened in early 2001 and designed by SOM, the facility was built for $1.4 billion and replaced JFK&#x27;s old International Arrivals Building (IAB), which opened in 1957 and was designed by the same architectural firm. The new construction incorporated a mezzanine-level AirTrain station, an expansive check-in hall, and a four-block-long retail area.

Terminal 4 has seen multiple expansions over the years. On May 24, 2013, the completion of a $1.4 billion project added mechanized checked-bag screening, a centralized security checkpoint (consolidating two checkpoints into one new fourth-floor location), nine international gates, improved U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities, and, at the time, the largest Sky Club lounge in Delta&#x27;s network. Later that year, the expansion also improved passenger connectivity with Terminal 2 by bolstering inter-terminal &quot;JFK Jitney&quot; shuttle bus service and building a dedicated 8,000 square-foot bus holdroom facility adjacent to gate B20. Also in 2013, Delta, JFKIAT and the Port Authority agreed to a further $175 million Phase II expansion, which called for 11 new regional jet gates to supersede capacity previously provided by the soon-to-be-demolished Terminal 2 hardstands and Terminal 3. Delta sought funding from the New York City Industrial Development Agency, and work on Phase II was completed in January 2015.

By 2017, plans to expand Terminal 4&#x27;s passenger capacity were being floated in conjunction with a more significant JFK modernization proposal. In early 2020, Governor Cuomo announced that the Port Authority and Delta/IAT had agreed to terms extending Concourse A by 16 domestic gates, renovating the arrival/departure halls, and improving land-side roadways for $3.8 billion. By April 2021, that plan had been scaled-back to $1.5 billion worth of improvements as a result of financial hardships imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The revised plan called for arrival/departure hall modernization and just ten new gates in Concourse A. Consolidation of Delta&#x27;s operations within T4 occurred in early 2023, along with the new gates opening. Delta also opened a new Sky Club in Concourse A. The airline plans to open a lounge exclusive to Delta One customers by June 2024. It would be the largest in the airline&#x27;s network.

In 2019, American Express began construction of a Centurion lounge that subsequently opened in October 2020. The structural addition extends the headhouse between the control tower and gate A2, and includes 15,000 square-feet of dining, bars, and fitness facilities.

In 2024, Terminal 4 announced an expansion of its Arts &amp; Culture program with a digital and static photography exhibit in collaboration with the Cradle of Aviation Museum; a mural representing Queens by local artist Zeehan Wazed; a series of photographs by Terminal 4 employees, and the first-ever freestanding hologram device in an airport in partnership with Proto hologram which shows animals from the Bronx Zoo and has been used to beam in comedian Howie Mandel as a live hologram to surprise passengers.

=== Terminal 5 ===

Terminal 5 opened in 2008 for JetBlue, the manager and primary tenant of the building, functioning as its operating base at JFK. The terminal is also used by Cape Air. On November 12, 2014, JetBlue opened the International Arrivals Concourse (T5i) at the terminal.

The terminal was redesigned by Gensler and constructed by Turner Construction, and sits behind the preserved Eero Saarinen-designed terminal originally known as the TWA Flight Center, which is now connected to the new structure and is considered part of Terminal 5. The TWA Flight Center reopened as the TWA Hotel in May 2019. The active Terminal 5 building has 30 gates: 1 through 12 and 14 through 30, with gates 25 through 30 handling international flights that are not pre-cleared (gates 28–30 opened in November 2014).

Aer Lingus opened an airport lounge in 2015. The terminal opened a rooftop lounge open to all passengers in 2015, T5 Rooftop &amp; Wooftop Lounge, located near Gate 28. In August 2016, Fraport USA was selected by JetBlue as the concessions developer to help attract and manage concessions tenants that align with JetBlue&#x27;s vision for Terminal 5. During the summer of 2016, JetBlue renovated Terminal 5, completely overhauling the check-in lobby.

=== Terminal 7 ===
Terminal 7 was designed by GMW Architects and built for British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and Air Canada in 1970. 

Prior to 2022, the terminal was operated by British Airways, and was also the only airport terminal operated on US soil by a foreign carrier. British Airways operated Concorde here until 2003.

Airlines operating out of Terminal 7 include Oneworld carrier Alaska Airlines; Star Alliance carriers Air Canada Express, All Nippon Airways, Ethiopian Airlines and LOT Polish Airlines; and non-alliance carriers Aer Lingus, Condor, Frontier Airlines, HiSky, Icelandair, Kuwait Airways, Norse Atlantic Airways, and Sun Country Airlines.

In 1989, the terminal was renovated and expanded for $120 million. The expansion was designed by William Nicholas Bodouva + Associates, Architects. In 1997, the Port Authority approved British Airways&#x27; plans to renovate and expand the terminal. The $250 million project was designed by Corgan Associates and was completed in 2003. The renovated terminal has 12 gates.

In 2015, British Airways extended its lease on the terminal through 2022, with an option of a further three years. BA also planned to spend $65 million to renovate the terminal. Despite being operated by British Airways, a major A380 operator, Terminal 7 is not currently able to handle the aircraft type. As a result, British Airways could not operate A380s on the lucrative London–Heathrow to New York flights, even though in 2014, there was an advertising campaign that British Airways was going to do so. British Airways planned to join its Oneworld partners in Terminal 8, however, and did not exercise its lease options on Terminal 7. The terminal is now operated by JFK Millennium Partners, a consortium including JetBlue, RXR Realty, and Vantage Airport Group, who will eventually demolish the current terminal. At the same time, a new Terminal 6 will begin to be built to serve as a direct replacement.

In late 2020, United Airlines announced they would return to JFK in February 2021 after a 5-year hiatus. As of March 28, 2021, United operated transcontinental nonstop service from Terminal 7 to its west coast hubs in San Francisco and Los Angeles. On October 29, 2022, however, United suspended service to JFK once again.

=== Terminal 8 ===

Terminal 8 is a major Oneworld hub with American Airlines operating its hub here. In 1999, American Airlines began an eight-year program to build the largest passenger terminal at JFK, designed by DMJM Aviation to replace both Terminal 8 and Terminal 9. Originally, the terminal was initially planned to house 59 gates and a &quot;check-in area larger than Giants Stadium&quot;. After budget shortfalls, the final plan eventually resulted in a scaled-down terminal with only 36 gates, and a headhouse with half of the originally modeled footprint. The new terminal was built in four phases, which involved the construction of a new midfield concourse and the demolition of old Terminals 8 and 9. It was built in stages between 2005 and its official opening in August 2007. American Airlines, the third-largest carrier at JFK, manages Terminal 8 and is the largest carrier at the terminal. Other Oneworld airlines that operate out of Terminal 8 include British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, and Royal Jordanian. Non-alliance carrier China Southern Airlines also uses the terminal.

In 2019, it was announced that British Airways and Iberia would move into Terminal 8 preceding the demolition of Terminal 7 and that the terminal would be expanded and changed to accommodate more widebody aircraft that British Airways, Iberia and other Oneworld airlines regularly send to JFK. On January 7, 2020, construction began expanding and improving Terminal 8 with construction completed in 2022. This construction marked the first phase in the airport&#x27;s expansion; the terminal had the same number of gates as before, plus four hardstands. British Airways began operating some flights out of Terminal 8 on November 17, 2022, while all flights moved from Terminal 7 on December 1, 2022. Iberia also moved to Terminal 8 on December 1, while Japan Airlines moved to the terminal on May 28, 2023.

The terminal is twice the size of Madison Square Garden. It offers dozens of retail and food outlets, 84 ticket counters, 44 self-service kiosks, ten security checkpoint lanes, and a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility that can process more than 1,600 people an hour. Terminal 8 has an annual capacity of 12.8M passengers. It has one American Airlines Admirals Club and three lounges for premium class passengers as well as frequent flyers (Greenwich, Soho, and Chelsea lounges).

Terminal 8 has 31 gates: 14 gates in Concourse B (1–8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20) and 17 gates in Concourse C (31–47). Passenger access to and from Concourse C is by a tunnel that includes moving walkways.

=== Reconstruction ===
On January 4, 2017, the office of then-New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced a plan to renovate most of the airport&#x27;s existing infrastructure for $7 to $10 billion. The Airport Master Plan Advisory Panel had reported that JFK, ranked 59th out of the world&#x27;s top 100 airports by Skytrax, was expected to experience severe capacity constraints from increased use. The airport was expected to serve about 75 million annual passengers in 2020 and 100 million by 2050, up from 60 million when the report was published. The panel had several recommendations, including enlarging the newer terminals; relocating older terminals; reconfiguring highway ramps and increasing the number of lanes on the Van Wyck Expressway; lengthening AirTrain JFK trainsets or connecting the line to the New York City transportation system, and rebuilding the Jamaica station with direct connections to the Long Island Rail Road and the New York City Subway. No start date has yet been proposed for the project; in July 2017, Cuomo&#x27;s office began accepting proposals for master plans to renovate the airport. When all the construction is finished, the airport will have 149 total gates: 145 with jetways and four hardstands. Notably, previous plans included adding cars to AirTrain trainsets; widening connector ramps between the Van Wyck Expressway and Grand Central Parkway in Kew Gardens; and adding another lane in each direction to the Van Wyck, at a combined cost of $1.5 billion. It is unclear how many, if any, of those proposals are still being considered.

====New Terminal 1====
In October 2018, Cuomo released details of a $13 billion plan to rebuild passenger facilities and approaches to JFK Airport. Two all-new international terminals would be built. One of the terminals, a $7 billion, , 23-gate structure replacing Terminals 1, 2 and the vacant space of Terminal 3. It will connect to Terminal 4, and it will be financed and built by a partnership between Munich Airport Group, Lufthansa, Air France, Korean Air, and Japan Airlines. Of these 23 gates, all are international gates, 22 are widebody gates (four of which can accommodate an Airbus A380), and one is a narrowbody gate. This would also require reconfiguring portions of the roadway network to accommodate the new terminal.

On December 13, 2021, New York Governor Kathy Hochul gave a further update on the plans to build a new Terminal 1, which in a further developed form would cost US$9.5 billion. The new facility is inspired by the new Terminal B at LaGuardia Airport. The new terminal will have New York City-inspired art, similar to Terminal B at LGA. The New Terminal 1 began construction on September 8, 2022, and will open in phases with the first 14 gates on its east side along with the departures and arrivals hall scheduled to open in 2026 on the site of the demolished Terminal 2. The current Terminal 1 will then be demolished, and in its place, the next five gates on the west side of the terminal will open in 2028, and the final four gates will open in 2030. An additional extension of the terminal on its west side with a further four gates (with an extra A380 gate) has been proposed in the event of excess traffic.

====Expanded Terminal 4====
On February 11, 2020, Cuomo and the Port Authority, along with Delta Air Lines, announced a $3.8 billion plan to add sixteen domestic, regional gates to the &#x27;A&#x27; side of Terminal 4, replacing Terminal 2. The main headhouse would have been expanded to accommodate additional passengers and open in 2022. The airport finished construction on a downsized plan in 2023, allowing the demolition of Terminal 2, the consolidation of flights for Delta, and the ability to build the new Terminal 1. An expanded roadway will be completed in 2025. Delta consolidated their operations into Terminal 4 in January 2023, along with opening 10 new gates in Terminal 4&#x27;s Concourse A. An additional expansion to Concourse B was expected to be completed by the fall of 2023.

====New Terminal 6====
Construction on a new Terminal 6 began in February 2023. The terminal was designed by Corgan and will have ten gates, nine of which will be wide-body gates. The terminal will be opened in multiple phases; the first phase is expected to be completed by 2026 and, , is projected to cost $4.2 billion. The full terminal is expected to open in 2028. The new terminal will connect to Terminal 5; Terminal 7 will be demolished after the new Terminal 6&#x27;s first phase of construction is completed. The construction will be built under a public–private partnership between the Port Authority and a consortium, known as JFK Millennium Partners, comprising JetBlue, RXR Realty, and Vantage Airport Group.

=== Former terminals ===
JFK Airport was originally built with ten terminals, compared to the five it has today. Ten terminals remained until the late 1990s, then nine remained until the early 2000s, followed by eight until 2011, seven until 2013 and six until 2023.

==== Terminal 1 (1959–1995) ====
The original Terminal 1 opened in November 1959, for Eastern Air Lines. It was designed by Chester L. Churchill. Eastern was the primary tenant of this terminal until its collapse on January 19, 1991. Shortly after Eastern&#x27;s collapse, the terminal became vacant until it was finally demolished in 1995. It was located on the site of today&#x27;s Terminal 1, which opened in 1998.

==== Terminal 2 (1962–2023) ====
Terminal 2 opened in November 1962 as the home of Northeast Airlines, Braniff International Airways, and Northwest Orient, and was last occupied by Delta Air Lines. The facility contained 11 jetbridge-equipped gates (C60–C70) and one mezzanine-level airline club, and it formerly housed several hardstands for smaller regional airliners. The terminal did not have a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing facility, and was unable to accept any international flights arriving unless subject to US Customs preclearance. It was designed by the architectural firm White &amp; Mariani.

Delta moved over to Terminal 2 following the merger with Northeast Airlines swapping places with Braniff, Pan Am moved its domestic flights to this terminal in 1986. Upon the completion of Terminal 4, T2&#x27;s gates were prefaced with the letter &#x27;C&#x27;, and airside shuttle buses provided passenger connectivity between the terminals. Before 2013, Terminal 2 hosted most of Delta&#x27;s operations in conjunction with Terminal 3. Still, the 2013–2015 expansion of Terminal 4 allowed the airline to consolidate most of its operations in the new larger facility, including international and transcontinental flights. In mid-2020, following drastic schedule reductions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Delta suspended all operations from Terminal 2; the terminal re-opened to flights in July 2021. Terminal 2 permanently closed for departures on January 10, 2023, and for arrivals on January 15, 2023. Terminal 2 was demolished to make room for the new Terminal 1.

==== Terminal 3 (1960–2013) ====
Terminal 3 opened as the Worldport on May 24, 1960, for Pan American World Airways (Pan Am); it expanded after the introduction of the Boeing 747 in 1971. After Pan Am&#x27;s demise in 1991, Delta Air Lines took over ownership of the terminal and was its only occupant until its closure on May 23, 2013. It had a connector to Terminal 2, Delta&#x27;s other terminal, used mainly for domestic flights. Terminal 3 had 16 Jetway-equipped gates: 1–10, 12, 14–18 with two hardstand gates (Gate 11) and a helipad on Taxiway KK.

A $1.2 billion project was completed in 2013, under which Terminal 4 was expanded, and Delta subsequently moved its T3 operations to T4.

On May 23, 2013, the final departure from the terminal, Delta Air Lines Flight 268, a Boeing 747-400 to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, departed from Gate 6 at 23:25 local time. The terminal ceased operations on May 24, 2013, exactly fifty-three years after its opening. Demolition began soon after that and was completed by Summer 2014. The site where Terminal 3 used to stand is now used for aircraft parking by Delta Air Lines.

There has been a major media outcry, particularly in other countries, over the demolition of the Worldport. Several online petitions requesting the restoration of the original &#x27;flying saucer&#x27; gained popularity.

==== International Arrivals Building ====
The International Arrivals Building (IAB) was opened in December 1957 and was replaced with the new Terminal 4 in 2001. It was designed by SOM.

==== TWA Flight Center ====
The TWA Flight Center was opened in 1962 and closed in 2001 after its primary tenant, Trans World Airlines, went out of business; the terminal had seen increased capacity issues in the years prior. It was designed by renowned architect Eero Saarinen, with extensions designed by Roche-Dinkeloo opening in 1970.

The TWA Flight Center was not demolished after closure, as it had been named a New York City designated landmark in 1994. Instead, it sat abandoned until it was incorporated into the current JetBlue Terminal 5. It was then converted into the Jet Age-themed TWA Hotel, which opened in 2019.

==== Terminal 6 (1969–2011) ====
Terminal 6 opened as the Sundrome on November 30, 1969, for National Airlines. National was the tenant of this terminal until it was fully acquired by Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) on January 7, 1980. Terminal 6 had 14 gates. It was designed by architect I.M. Pei.

Trans World Airlines (TWA) then expanded into the terminal, referring to it as the TWA Terminal Annex, later called the TWA Domestic Terminal. It was eventually connected to the TWA Flight Center. Later, after TWA reduced flights at JFK, Terminal 6 was used by United Airlines (SFO and LAX transcontinental flights), ATA Airlines, a reincarnated Pan Am II, Carnival Air Lines, Vanguard Airlines, and America West Airlines.

In 2000, JetBlue began service from Terminal 6, later opening a temporary complex in 2006 that increased its capacity by adding seven gates. Until 2008, JetBlue was the tenant of Terminal 6. It became vacant on October 22, 2008, when JetBlue moved to Terminal 5 and was finally demolished in 2011. The international arrivals annex of Terminal 5 now uses a portion of the site, and the rest of the site is used for aircraft parking by JetBlue, but will be occupied by the new Terminal 6, an annex to Terminal 5, planned to be fully opened by 2027.

==== Terminal 8 (1960–2008) ====
The original Terminal 8 opened in February 1960; its stained-glass façade was the largest at the time. It was always used by American Airlines, and, in later years, it was used by other Oneworld airlines that did not use Terminal 7. This terminal, along with Terminal 9, was demolished in 2008 and replaced with the current Terminal 8.

==== Terminal 9 (1959–2008) ====
Terminal 9 opened in October 1959 as the home of United Airlines and Delta Air Lines. Braniff International Airways moved over to Terminal 9 in 1972 after swapping terminals with Delta following Delta&#x27;s acquisition of Northeast Airlines. It operated out of Terminal 9 until its collapse on May 12, 1982. United used Terminal 9 from its opening in 1959 until it vacated the terminal in 1991 and became a tenant at British Airways&#x27; Terminal 7. Northwest Airlines used Terminal 9 from 1986 to 1991. Terminal 9 became the home of American Airlines&#x27; domestic operations and American Eagle flights for the remainder of its life. This terminal, along with the original Terminal 8, was demolished in 2008 and replaced with the current Terminal 8.

==== Tower Air terminal ====
The Tower Air terminal, unlike other terminals at JFK Airport, sat outside the Central Terminals area in Building 213 in Cargo Area A. Originally used by Pan Am until the expansion of the Worldport (later Terminal 3), it was later used by Tower Air and TWA shuttle until the airline was acquired by American Airlines in 2001. Building 213 has not been used since 2000.

== Runways and taxiways ==
The airport covers 5,200 acres or . Over of paved taxiways allow aircraft to move around the airfield. The standard width of these taxiways is , with heavy-duty shoulders and erosion control pavement on each side. The taxiways are generally of asphalt concrete composition thick. Painted markings, lighted signage, and embedded pavement lighting, including runway status lights, provide both position and directional information for taxiing aircraft. There are four runways (two pairs of parallel runways) surrounding the airport&#x27;s central terminal area.
== Operational facilities ==
=== Air navigation ===
The air traffic control tower, designed by Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners and constructed on the ramp-side of Terminal 4, began full FAA operations in October 1994. An Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE) radar unit sits atop the tower. At the time of its completion, the JFK tower, at , was the world&#x27;s tallest control tower. It was subsequently displaced from that position by towers at other airports in both the United States and overseas, including those at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, currently the tallest tower at any U.S. airport, at and at KLIA2 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, currently the world&#x27;s tallest control tower at .

A VOR-DME station, identified as JFK, is located on the airport property between runways 4R/22L and 4L/22R.

=== Physical plant ===
JFK is supplied with electricity by the Kennedy International Airport Power Plant, owned and operated by Calpine Corporation. The natural gas-fired electric cogeneration facility uses two General Electric LM6000 gas turbine engines to supply a total of 110 megawatts, which is purchased by the Port Authority for airport operations. Excess energy is also sold to the New York Independent System Operator. The facility was authorized in 1990, designed by RMJM, and first entered commercial service in February 1995.

Heating and cooling for all of JFK&#x27;s passenger terminals is provided by a co-located Central Heating and Refrigeration Plant (CHRP) in conjunction with a Thermal Distribution System (TDS) that entered service in August 1994. Waste heat from the power plant powers two heat recovery steam generators and a 25-megawatt steam turbine, which in turn run chillers to generate 28,000 tons of refrigeration, or heat exchangers to create 225 million Btu/hour.

=== Aviation ground service ===
Aircraft service facilities include seven aircraft hangars, an engine overhaul building, a aircraft fuel storage facility, and a truck garage. Fixed-base operation service for general aviation flights is provided by Modern Aviation, which possesses the airport&#x27;s exclusive helipad.

== Other facilities ==
The airport hosts an extensive array of administrative, government, and air cargo support buildings. In 2002, the New York metropolitan area accounted for 18 percent of import (and over 24 percent of all) air cargo volume in the nation. At that time, JFK itself was reported to have 4.5 million ft2 (418,064 m2) of warehouse space with another under construction.


Three chapels, including Our Lady of the Skies Chapel, provide for the religious needs of airline passengers.

In January 2017, the Ark at JFK Airport, a luxury terminal for pets, opened for $65 million. Ark was built ostensibly so that people who were transporting pets and other animals would be able to provide luxurious accommodations for these animals. At the time, it was supposed to be the only such facility in the U.S. In January 2018, Ark&#x27;s owner sued the Port Authority for violating a clause that would have given Ark the exclusive rights to inspect all animals who arrive at JFK from other countries. In the lawsuit, the owner stated that Ark had incurred significant operational losses because many animals were instead being transported to a United States Department of Agriculture facility in Newburgh.

=== Airport hotels ===
Several hotels are adjacent to JFK Airport, including the Courtyard by Marriott and the Crowne Plaza. The former Ramada Plaza JFK Hotel is Building 144, and it was formerly the only on-site hotel at JFK Airport. It was previously a part of Forte Hotels and previously the Travelodge New York JFK. Due to its role in housing friends and relatives of aircraft crash victims in the 1990s and 2000s, the hotel became known as the &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. In 2009 the PANYNJ stated in its preliminary 2010 budget that it was closing the hotel due to &quot;declining aviation activity and a need for substantial renovation&quot; and that it expected to save $1 million per month. The hotel closed on December 1, 2009. Almost 200 employees lost their jobs.

On July 27, 2015, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced in a press conference that the TWA Flight Center building would be used by the TWA Hotel, a 505-room hotel with of conference, event, or meeting space. The new hotel is estimated to have cost $265 million. The hotel has a observation deck with an infinity pool. Groundbreaking for the hotel occurred on December 15, 2016, and it opened on May 15, 2019.

== Airlines and destinations ==
=== Passenger ===

=== Cargo ===
When ranked by the value of shipments passing through it, JFK is the number three freight gateway in the United States (after the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of New York and New Jersey), and the number one international air freight gateway in the United States. Almost 21% of all U.S. international air freight by value and 9.6% by tonnage moved through JFK in 2008.

The JFK air cargo complex is a Foreign Trade Zone, which legally lies outside the customs area of the United States. JFK is a major hub for air cargo between the United States and Europe. London, Brussels and Frankfurt are JFK&#x27;s three top trade routes. The European airports are mostly a link in a global supply chain, however. The top destination markets for cargo flying out of JFK in 2003 were Tokyo, Seoul and London. Similarly, the top origin markets for imports at JFK were Seoul, Hong Kong, Taipei and London.

20 cargo airlines operate out of JFK, among them: Air ACT, Air China Cargo, ABX Air, Asiana Cargo, Atlas Air, CAL Cargo Air Lines, Cargolux, Cathay Cargo, China Airlines, EVA Air Cargo, Emirates SkyCargo, Nippon Cargo Airlines, FedEx Express, DHL Aviation, Kalitta Air, Korean Air Cargo, Lufthansa Cargo, UPS Airlines, Southern Air, National Airlines, Icelandair Cargo, and, formerly, World Airways. Top 5 carriers together transported 33.1% of all revenue freight in 2005: American Airlines (10.9% of the total), FedEx Express (8.8%), Lufthansa Cargo (5.2%), Korean Air Cargo (4.9%), and China Airlines (3.8%).

There are also some on-demand cargo charter services to JFK, operated by carriers such as Silk Way West Airlines.

Most cargo and maintenance facilities at JFK are located north and west of the main terminal area. DHL, FedEx Express, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa, Nippon Cargo Airlines and United Airlines have cargo facilities at JFK. In 2000, Korean Air Cargo opened a new $102 million cargo terminal at JFK with total floor area of and capability of handling 200,000 tons annually. In 2007, American Airlines opened a new priority parcel service facility at their Terminal 8, featuring 30-minute drop-offs and pick-ups for priority parcel shipments within the US.

=== Information services ===
In the immediate vicinity of the airport, parking and other information can be obtained by tuning to a highway advisory radio station at 1630 AM. A second station at 1700 AM provides information on traffic concerns for drivers leaving the airport.

Kennedy Airport, along with the other Port Authority airports (LaGuardia and Newark), uses a uniform style of signage throughout the airport properties. Yellow signs direct passengers to airline gates, ticketing and other flight services; green signs direct passengers to ground transportation services and black signs lead to restrooms, telephones and other passenger amenities. In addition, the Port Authority operates &quot;Welcome Centers&quot; and taxi dispatch booths in each airline terminal, where staff provide customers with information on taxis, limousines, other ground transportation and hotels.

Former New York City traffic reporter Bernie Wagenblast provides the voice for the airport&#x27;s radio stations and the messages heard on board AirTrain JFK and in its stations.

=== Notable staff ===
Stephen Abraham, colloquially known as Kennedy Steve, was an air traffic controller at JFK between 1994 and 2017. Abraham was known for his distinct &quot;informal&quot; tone and controlling-style while handling ground traffic at the airport. Many of his interactions with pilots were recorded and featured on various social media platforms, including various YouTube channels. In 2017, Abraham was awarded the Dale Wright Award by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) for distinguished professionalism and exceptional career service to NATCA and the National Airspace System. In 2019, he was hired as Airside Operations and Ramp Manager at JFK&#x27;s Terminal 1.

<text>Apep (), also known as Aphoph (, ) or Apophis (; ), is the ancient Egyptian deity who embodied darkness and disorder, and was thus the opponent of light and Maat (order/truth). Ra was the bringer of light and hence the biggest opposer of Apep.

==Features==
Because Ra was the solar deity, bringer of light, and thus the upholder of Maat, Apep was viewed as the greatest enemy of Ra, and thus was given the title &quot;Enemy of Ra&quot;, and also &quot;the Lord of Chaos&quot;.

&quot;The Lord of Chaos&quot; was seen as a giant snake or serpent leading to such titles as &quot;Serpent from the Nile&quot; and &quot;Evil Dragon&quot;. Some elaborations said that he stretched 16 yards in length and had a head made of flint. 

Presented on a Naqada I (c. 4000–3550 BCE) C-ware bowl (now in Cairo) a snake was painted on the inside rim combined with other desert and aquatic animals as an enemy of a deity, seemingly a solar deity, who is invisibly hunting in a big rowing vessel. The snake on the inside rim is believed to be Apep.

The few descriptions of Apep&#x27;s origin in myth usually demonstrate that it was born after Ra, usually from his umbilical cord. Geraldine Pinch claims that a much later creation myth explained that, &quot;Apophis sprang from the saliva of the goddess Neith when she was still in the primeval waters. Her spit became a snake 120 yards long.&quot; 
But Apep was commonly believed to have existed from the beginning of time in the waters of Nu of primeval chaos.

==Battles with Ra==

Tales of Apep&#x27;s battles against Ra were elaborated during the New Kingdom. Storytellers said that every day Apep must lie below the horizon and not persist in the mortal kingdom. This appropriately made him a part of the underworld. In some stories, Apep waited for Ra in a western mountain called &quot;Manu&quot;, where the sun set, and in others, Apep lurked just before dawn, in the &quot;Tenth region of the Night&quot;. The wide range of Apep&#x27;s possible locations gained him the title &quot;World-Encircler&quot;. It was thought that his terrifying roar would cause the underworld to rumble. Myths sometimes say that Apep was trapped there, because he had been the previous chief god overthrown by Ra, or because he was evil and had been imprisoned.

The Coffin Texts imply that Apep used a magical gaze to overwhelm Ra and his entourage. Ra was assisted by a number of defenders who travelled with him, including Set and possibly the Eye of Ra. Apep&#x27;s movements were thought to cause earthquakes, and his battles with Set may have been meant to explain the origin of thunderstorms. In one account, Ra himself defeats Apep in the form of a cat.

==Religious Practices==
Ra&#x27;s victory each night was thought to be ensured by the prayers of the Egyptian priests and worshippers at temples. The Egyptians practiced a number of rituals and superstitions that were thought to ward off Apep, and aid Ra in continuing his journey across the sky.

In an annual rite called the &quot;Ritual of Overthrowing Apophis&quot;, priests would build an effigy of Apep that was thought to contain all of the evil and darkness in Egypt, and burn it to protect everyone from Apep&#x27;s evil for another year.

The Egyptian priests had a detailed guide to fighting Apep, referred to as &quot;The Books of Overthrowing Apep&quot; (or the &quot;Book of Apophis&quot;, in Greek). The chapters described a gradual process of dishonoring, dismemberment, and disposal, which include:
*Spitting Upon Apep
*Defiling Apep with the Left Foot
*Taking a Lance to Smite Apep
*Fettering Apep
*Taking a Knife to Smite Apep
*Putting Fire Upon Apep

In addition to stories about Ra&#x27;s victories, this guide had instructions for making wax models, or small drawings, of the serpent, which would be spat on, mutilated and burnt, whilst reciting spells that would aid Ra in killing Apep. Fearing that even the image of Apep could give power to the demon, any rendering would always include another deity to subdue the monster.

As Apep was thought to live in the underworld, he was sometimes thought of as an &quot;Eater of Souls&quot;. Thus the dead also needed protection, so they were sometimes buried with spells that could destroy Apep. The &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; does not frequently describe occasions when Ra defeated the chaos snake explicitly called Apep. Only &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; Spells 7 and 39 can be explained as such.

<text>In Egyptian mythology, the name Mehen (), meaning &#x27;coiled one&#x27;, referred to a mythological snake-god and to a board game.
==Snake god==
The earliest known references to Mehen occur in the Coffin Texts. Mehen is a protective deity who is depicted as a snake which coils around the sun god Ra during his journey through the night, for instance in the Amduat. 

In the German-Egyptian dictionary by R. Hannig, it is said that the Mehen (mḥn) or the Mehenet (mḥnt) snake is equivalent to the Ouroboros.

==Relationship between snake-god and Mehen game==

The precise relationship between the deity and the Mehen game is unknown. For instance it is not known whether the game derives from the mythological character, or the character derives from the game.

It is known that the object known as mehen depicts a game rather than a religious fetish as studies of paintings in tombs and game boards and equipment demonstrate this. The rules and method of playing the game are unknown, although rules have been created in modern times based on assessments of how it may have been played.

<text>Ammit (; , &quot;Devourer of the Dead&quot;; also rendered Ammut or Ahemait) was an ancient Egyptian goddess with the forequarters of a lion, the hindquarters of a hippopotamus, and the head of a crocodile—the three largest &quot;man-eating&quot; animals known to ancient Egyptians. In ancient Egyptian religion, Ammit played an important role during the funerary ritual, the Judgment of the Dead.

== Nomenclature ==
Ammit (; ) means &quot;devourer of the dead&quot; (&quot;devoureress of the dead&quot;) or &quot;swallower of the dead&quot;, where is the verb &quot;to swallow&quot;, and signifies &quot;the dead&quot;, more specifically the dead who had been adjudged not to belong to the (&quot;blessed dead&quot;) who abided by the code of truth (Ma&#x27;at).

== Iconography ==
Ammit is denoted as a female entity, commonly depicted with the head of a crocodile, the forelegs and upper body of a lion (or leopard), and the hind legs and lower body of a hippopotamus. The combination of three deadly animals of the Nile: crocodile, lion, and hippopotamus, suggests that no one can escape annihilation, even in the afterlife. She is part lioness, but her leonine features may present in the form of a mane, which is usually associated with male lions. In the Papyrus of Ani, Ammit is adorned with a tri-colored nemes, which were worn by pharaohs as a symbol of kingship.

Versions of the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; from the New Kingdom started to include Ammit. During the eighteenth dynasty, the crocodile-lion-hippopotamus hybrid was the conventional depiction of Ammit. She appeared in scenes showing the Judgment of the Dead, in tombs and funerary papyri. In this scene, Ammit is shown with other Egyptian gods in Duat, waiting to learn if she can consume the heart of the deceased. A stylistic shift occurred, during the Third Intermediate Period. Around the twenty-first dynasty, the Judgment of the Dead scene was painted on the interior and exterior of coffins. The coffin lid of Ankh-hor, a chief from the twenty-second dynasty featured Ammit bearing the head of a hippopotamus, and the body of a dog with rows of paps.While the Papyrus of Nes-min (ca. 300–250 BCE) from the Ptolemaic Period, portrayed Ammit with the head of a crocodile, and the body of a dog.

== Role in ancient Egyptian religion ==
Unlike other gods featured in ancient Egyptian religion, Ammit was not worshipped. Instead, Ammit was feared and believed to be a demon rather than a deity, due to her role as the &#x27;devourer of the dead&#x27;. During the New Kingdom, deities and demons were differentiated by having a cult or center of worship. Demons in ancient Egyptian religion had supernatural powers and roles, but were ranked below the gods and did not have a place of worship. In the case of Ammit, she was a guardian demon. A guardian demon was tied to a specific place, such as Duat. Their appearance was based on a hybrid of an animal or a human and was denoted so the dead could recognize them. Guardian demons that appeared as a hybrid of animals were an amalgamation of traits meant to be feared and to differentiate them from deities associated with humanity.

Prior to the New Kingdom and the creation of Chapter 125 in the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, Ammit did not have a large presence in ancient Egyptian religion. However, Khonsu, the god of the moon, was depicted as a &#x27;devourer of the dead and hearts&#x27; in Old Kingdom pyramid texts and Middle Kingdom Coffin Texts.

Throughout the First Intermediate Period and the Middle Kingdom, a collection of spells was created to form the Coffin Texts. In Spell 310, Khonsu burned hearts heavier than the feather of ma&#x27;at during the Judgment of the Dead. In Spell 311, Khonsu devoured the hearts of the gods and the dead. Divine hearts were devoured for their power. Hearts deemed impure during judgment were devoured, leaving the deceased trapped in Duat. These spells were among those adapted into the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; starting in the New Kingdom.

Spells 310 and 311 of the Coffin Texts are referred to in Chapters 79, and 125 in the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;. Chapter 79 refers to the burning of the heart, while the scene of judgment and devouring of hearts is found in Chapter 125. Instead of Khonsu devouring the heart of the dead, Ammit was referred to as the &#x27;devourer of the dead&#x27;. Ammit was present during the weighing of the heart, usually near the scale waiting to learn the results. If the heart of the dead was impure, she ate their heart leaving them soulless and trapped in Duat.

=== Weighing of the heart ===
The &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; was a collection of funerary texts used to guide the dead to Duat, the Egyptian underworld. The process of the Judgment of the Dead was described in Chapter 125. The ruler of Duat, Osiris, presided over judgment. New Kingdom depictions of this scene occurred at the Hall of the Two Truths (or Two &quot;Maats&quot;). Anubis, the Guardian of the Scales, conducted the dead towards the weighing scale. Ammit would be situated near the scale, awaiting the results. While Thoth, the god of hieroglyphs and judgment, would record the results. The heart of the deceased was weighed against the feather of Ma&#x27;at, the goddess of truth. The feather of Ma&#x27;at symbolized the balance, and truthfulness needed to be present during one&#x27;s lifetime. The heart or &quot;Ib&quot;, represented the individual&#x27;s soul and was the key to traveling to Aaru.

In Chapter 125 of the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, the deceased is given a series of declarations to recite at the Judgment of the Dead. &quot;The Declaration of Innocence&quot; was a list of 42 sins the deceased was innocent of committing. &quot;The Declaration to the Forty-two Gods&quot; and &quot;The Address to the Gods&quot; were recited directly to the gods, proclaiming the deceased&#x27;s purity and loyalty.

 After the declarations are recited, their heart is weighted. If the heart was weighted less than the feather of Ma&#x27;at, the deceased was ruled to be pure. Thoth recorded the result and Osiris would allow the deceased to continue their voyage toward Aaru and immortality. If the heart was heavier than the feather of Ma&#x27;at, the deceased was deemed impure. Ammit would devour their heart, leaving the deceased without a soul. Ancient Egyptians believed the soul would become restless forever, dying a second death. Instead of living in Aaru, the soulless individual would be stuck in Duat.

Ammit is often depicted sitting in a crouched position near the scale, ready to eat the heart. Ancient Egyptians were buried with a copy of the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, guaranteeing they would be successful at the Judgment of the Dead. Thus, Ammit was left hungry without any hearts to eat, and the consecrated dead was then able to bypass the Lake of Fire, featured in Chapter 126 of the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Saba Mubarak portrays Ammit in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series &quot;Moon Knight&quot; (2022). In the &quot;Mummies Alive!&quot; cartoon series, the main villain Scarab accidentally summons Ammut, and she sticks around. In the show, she is a dog-like and rather small-sized pet who does not speak. In Rick Riordan&#x27;s series &quot;The Kane Chronicles&quot;, Ammit is portrayed. In &quot;Primeval&quot;, Ammit was a &quot;Pristichampsus&quot; that came through an Anomaly (a gateway in time) to ancient Egypt, where people believed it to be a god.

<text>The phrase &quot;perverse incentive&quot; is often used in economics to describe an incentive structure with undesirable results, particularly when those effects are unexpected and contrary to the intentions of its designers.

The results of a perverse incentive scheme are also sometimes called cobra effects, where people are incentivized to make a problem worse. This name was coined by economist Horst Siebert based on an anecdote taken from the British Raj. The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi, offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. The cobra breeders set their snakes free, leading to an overall increase in the wild cobra population.

== Examples of perverse incentives ==

=== Electoral systems ===

* A well-known example in social choice is perverse response, where a candidate can lose an election if the voters rank them higher. This occurs under single transferable vote and related systems (like primary elections and the two-round system).

=== Pest control campaigns ===

* The Great Hanoi Rat Massacre occurred in 1902, in Hanoi, Vietnam (then known as French Indochina), when, under French colonial rule, the colonial government created a bounty program that paid a reward for each rat killed. To collect the bounty, people would need to provide the severed tail of a rat. Colonial officials, however, began noticing rats in Hanoi with no tails. The Vietnamese rat catchers would capture rats, sever their tails, then release them back into the sewers so that they could produce more rats.
* Experiencing an issue with feral pigs, the U.S. Army post of Fort Benning (now named Fort Moore) in Georgia offered hunters a $40-bounty for every pig tail turned in. Over the course of the 2007–2008 program, the feral pig population in the area increased. While there were some reports that individuals purchased pigs&#x27; tails from meat processors then resold the tails to the Army at the higher bounty price, a detailed study of the bounty scheme found different effects from perverse incentives were mainly responsible. Both the pigs&#x27; fertility rate and offspring survival rates increased under the scheme. This was due to improved nutrition made available by the feed bait used to attract the animals to hunting sites. Secondly, hunters were found to be more likely to preferentially target large males as &quot;trophy&quot;-quality game, while ignoring females and juveniles as targets. Removal of mature males from the population has a negligible impact on population growth, as remaining mature males can each stud many breeding sows.

=== Community safety and harm reduction ===

* In 2002, British officials tasked with suppressing opium production in Afghanistan offered poppy farmers $700 an acre in return for destroying their crop. This ignited a poppy-growing frenzy among Afghan farmers, who sought to plant as many poppies as they could in order to collect payouts from the cash-for-poppies program. Some farmers harvested and sold the sap before destroying the plants, receiving significantly more money for the same amount of poppies.
* Gun buyback programs are carried out by governments to reduce the number of guns in circulation, by purchasing firearms from citizens at a flat rate (and then destroying them). Some residents of areas with gun buyback programs have 3D printed large numbers of crude parts that met the minimum legal definition of a firearm, for the purpose of immediately turning them in for the cash payout.
* In 2021, the US Congress enacted stringent requirements to prevent sesame, a potential allergen, from cross-contaminating other foods. Many companies found it simpler and less expensive to instead modify their recipes and add sesame directly to the food as an ingredient, exempting them from complying with the law.
* In Alberta, under the &quot;Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act&quot;, every person must report suspected child abuse to a director or police officer, and failure to do so is punishable by a $10,000 fine plus 6 months of imprisonment. However, according to criminal law professor Narayan, enforcing it would cause people to overreport, which wastes resources, and it would also create a chilling effect that prevents people from reporting child abuse observed over a period of time, as that would incriminate them for failing to report earlier. There are similar laws in other Canadian provinces.

===Environmental and wildlife protection===

* The United States Endangered Species Act of 1973 imposes development restrictions on landowners who find endangered species on their property. While this policy has some positive effects for wildlife, it also encourages preemptive habitat destruction (draining swamps or cutting down trees that might host valuable species) by landowners who fear losing the lucrative development-friendliness of their land because of the presence of an endangered species. In some cases, endangered species may even be deliberately killed to avoid discovery.
* In 2005 the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change began an incentive scheme to cut down on greenhouse gases. Companies disposing of polluting gases were rewarded with carbon credits, which could eventually get converted into cash. The program set prices according to how serious the damage the pollutant could do to the environment was and attributed one of the highest bounties for destroying HFC-23, a byproduct of a common refrigerant, HCFC-22. As a result, companies began to produce more of this refrigerant in order to destroy more of the byproduct waste gas, and collect millions of dollars in credits. This increased production also caused the price of the refrigerant to decrease significantly, motivating refrigeration companies to continue using it, despite the adverse environmental effects. In 2013, credits for the destruction of HFC-23 were suspended in the European Union.
* In 2017, the Renewable Heat Incentive paid businesses to replace coal with renewable heating, typically bioenergy in the form of wood pellets. However, the subsidy for the energy was greater than its cost, which allowed businesses to make a profit simply by burning as much fuel as possible and heating empty buildings. The political fall-out caused the Northern Ireland Executive to collapse in 2017. It was not re-convened until 2020.

=== Historic preservation schemes ===

* The United Kingdom&#x27;s listed building regulations are intended to protect historically important buildings, by requiring owners to seek permission before making any changes to listed buildings. In 2017, the owners of an unlisted historic building in Bristol destroyed a 400-year-old ceiling the day before a scheduled visit by listings officers, allegedly to prevent the building from being listed, which could have limited future development.
* The Tax Reform Act of 1976 provided for loss of tax benefits if owners demolished buildings. This led to an increase in arson attacks in the 1970s as a way of clearing land without financial penalties. The law was later altered to remove this aspect.

=== Healthcare cost control ===

* Paying medical professionals and reimbursing insured patients for treatment but not prevention encourages medical conditions to be ignored until treatment is required. Moreover, paying only for treatment effectively discourages prevention (which would improve quality of life for the patient but would also reduce the demand for future treatments).
* Payment for treatment generates a perverse incentive for unnecessary treatments. In 2015, a Detroit area doctor was sentenced to 45 years of prison for intentionally giving patients unnecessary cancer treatments, for which health insurance paid him at least 17.6 million dollars. Unnecessary treatment may harm in the form of side effects of drugs and surgery, which can then trigger a demand for further treatments themselves.
* Medicare reimburses doctors at a higher rate if they administer more expensive medications to treat a condition. This creates an incentive for the physician to prescribe a more expensive drug when a less expensive one might do.

=== Humanitarian and welfare policies ===

* In the 2000s, Canada negotiated a &quot;Safe Third Country Agreement&quot; with the U.S. under which applicants for political asylum could only apply in the first of the two countries they reached, in order to discourage asylum shopping. Among the provisions was one that denied anyone entering Canada at an official port of entry from requesting asylum there, in theory limiting asylum applications to either those filed by refugees in camps abroad or those who could legally travel to Canada and do so at an immigration office. In the late 2010s, some migrants began entering Canada illegally, between official border crossings, at places like Roxham Road between New York and Quebec, since once they were in Canada, they were allowed to file applications with the full range of appeals available to them, a process that could take years. Canada wound up processing thousands more applications for asylum than it had planned to.
* A welfare trap is a situation where a person would make less money working (or working more hours) than they do receiving state benefits, as a result of means testing rendering them ineligible for benefits.

===Promotional schemes and public relations ===

* Hacktoberfest is an October-long celebration to promote contributions to the free and open-source software communities. In 2020, participants were encouraged to submit four or more pull requests to any public free or open-source (FOS) repository, with a free &quot;Hacktoberfest 2020&quot; T-shirt for the first 75,000 participants to do so. The free T-shirts caused frivolous pull requests on FOS projects.
* Around 2010, online retailer Vitaly Borker found that online complaints about his eyeglass-sale website, DecorMyEyes, pushed the site to the top of Google searches and drove more traffic. He began responding to customer reports of poor quality and/or misfilled orders with insults, threats of violence, and other harassment. Borker continued writing toxic replies for a decade despite serving two separate sentences in U.S. federal prison over charges arising from them.

=== Returns for effort ===

* The 20th-century paleontologist G. H. R. von Koenigswald used to pay Javanese locals for each fragment of hominin skull that they produced. He later discovered that the people had been breaking up whole skulls into smaller pieces to maximize their payments.
* In building the first transcontinental railroad in the 1860s, the United States Congress agreed to pay the builders per mile of track laid. As a result, Thomas C. Durant of Union Pacific Railroad lengthened a section of the route, forming a bow shape and unnecessarily adding miles of track.
* Funding fire departments by the number of fire calls that are made is intended to reward fire departments that do the most work. However, it may discourage them from fire-prevention activities, leading to an increase in actual fires.

<doc id="97236" wikidata="Q170471" url="?curid=97236" title="Maat">
<text>Maat or Maʽat (Egyptian: /ˈmuʀʕat/, Coptic: ) comprised the ancient Egyptian concepts of truth, balance, order, harmony, law, morality, and justice. Maat was also the goddess who personified these concepts, and regulated the stars, seasons, and the actions of mortals and the deities who had brought order from chaos at the moment of creation. Her ideological opposite was Isfet (Egyptian &quot;&quot;), meaning injustice, chaos, violence or to do evil.

==Pronunciation==
Cuneiform texts indicate that the word &quot;m3ˤt&quot; was pronounced /múʔʕa/ during the New Kingdom of Egypt, having lost the feminine ending &quot;t&quot;. Vowel assimilation of &quot;u&quot; to &quot;e&quot; later produced the Coptic word &quot;truth, justice&quot;.

==History==
The earliest surviving records indicating that Maat is the norm for nature and society, in this world and the next, were recorded during the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the earliest substantial surviving examples being found in the Pyramid Texts of Unas ( and 2345 BCE).

Later, when most goddesses were paired with a male aspect, her masculine counterpart was Thoth, as their attributes are similar. In other accounts, Thoth was paired off with Seshat, goddess of writing and measure, who is a lesser-known deity.

After her role in creation and continuously preventing the universe from returning to chaos, her primary role in ancient Egyptian religion dealt with the Weighing of the Heart that took place in the Duat. Her feather was the measure that determined whether the souls (considered to reside in the heart) of the departed would reach the paradise of the afterlife successfully. In other versions, Maat was the feather as the personification of truth, justice, and harmony.

Pharaohs are often depicted with the emblems of Maat to emphasise their roles in upholding the laws and righteousness. From the Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1550 – 1295 BC) Maat was described as the daughter of Ra, indicating that pharaohs were believed to rule through her authority.

==Goddess==
Maat was the goddess of harmony, justice, and truth represented as a young woman. Sometimes she is depicted with wings on each arm or as a woman with an ostrich feather on her head. The meaning of this emblem is uncertain, although the god Shu, who in some myths is Maat&#x27;s brother, also wears it. Depictions of Maat as a goddess are recorded from as early as the middle of the Old Kingdom (c. 2680 to 2190 BCE).

The sun-god Ra came from the primaeval mound of creation only after he set his daughter Maat in place of &quot;isfet&quot; (chaos). Kings inherited the duty to ensure Maat remained in place, and they with Ra are said to &quot;live on Maat&quot;, with Akhenaten (r. 1372–1355 BCE) in particular emphasising the concept to a degree that the king&#x27;s contemporaries viewed as intolerance and fanaticism. Some kings incorporated Maat into their names, being referred to as &quot;Lords of Maat&quot;, or &quot;Meri-Maat&quot; (&quot;Beloved of Maat&quot;).

Maat had a central role in the ceremony of the Weighing of the Heart, where the decedent&#x27;s heart was weighed against her feather.

==Principle==
Maat represents the ethical and moral principle that all Egyptian citizens were expected to follow throughout their daily lives. They were expected to act with honor and truth in matters that involve family, the community, the nation, the environment, and the gods.

Maat as a principle was formed to meet the complex needs of the emergent Egyptian state that embraced diverse peoples with conflicting interests. The development of such rules sought to avert chaos and it became the basis of Egyptian law. From an early period the king would describe himself as the &quot;Lord of Maat&quot; who decreed with his mouth the Maat he conceived in his heart.

The significance of Maat developed to the point that it embraced all aspects of existence, including the basic equilibrium of the universe, the relationship between constituent parts, the cycle of the seasons, heavenly movements, religious observations and good faith, honesty, and truthfulness in social interactions.

The ancient Egyptians had a deep conviction of an underlying holiness and unity within the universe. Cosmic harmony was achieved by correct public and ritual life. Any disturbance in cosmic harmony could have consequences for the individual as well as the state. An impious king could bring about famine, and blasphemy could bring blindness to an individual. In opposition to the right order expressed in the concept of Maat is the concept of Isfet: chaos, lies and violence.

In addition, several other principles within ancient Egyptian law were essential, including an adherence to tradition as opposed to change, the importance of rhetorical skill and the significance of achieving impartiality and &quot;righteous action&quot;. In one Middle Kingdom (2062 to c. 1664 BCE) text, the creator declares &quot;I made every man like his fellow&quot;. Maat called the rich to help the less fortunate rather than exploit them, echoed in tomb declarations: &quot;I have given bread to the hungry and clothed the naked&quot; and &quot;I was a husband to the widow and father to the orphan&quot;.

To the Egyptian mind, Maat bound all things together in an indestructible unity: the universe, the natural world, the state, and the individual were all seen as parts of the wider order generated by Maat.

A passage in the Instruction of Ptahhotep presents Maat as follows:

===Law===

There is little surviving literature that describes the practice of ancient Egyptian law. Maat was the spirit in which justice was applied rather than the detailed legalistic exposition of rules. Maat represented the normal and basic values that formed the backdrop for the application of justice that had to be carried out in the spirit of truth and fairness. From the Fifth Dynasty (c. 2510–2370 BCE) onwards, the vizier responsible for justice was called the &quot;Priest of Maat&quot; and in later periods judges wore images of Maat.

Later scholars and philosophers also would embody concepts from the Sebayt, a native wisdom literature. These spiritual texts dealt with common social or professional situations, and how each was best to be resolved or addressed in the spirit of Maat. It was very practical advice, and highly case-based, so few specific and general rules could be derived from them.

During the Greek period in Egyptian history, Greek law existed alongside Egyptian law. The Egyptian law preserved the rights of women, who were allowed to act independently of men and own substantial personal property, and in time, this influenced the more restrictive conventions of the Greeks and Romans. When the Romans took control of Egypt, the Roman legal system, which existed throughout the Roman Empire, was imposed in Egypt.

==Scribes and scribal school==
=== Scribes ===
The ethical aspect of Maat gave rise to the social formation of groups of elite individuals called &quot;sesh&quot; referring to intellectuals, scribes, or bureaucrats. Besides serving as the civil servant of the kingdom, the &quot;sesh&quot; had a central role in the society since the ethical and moral concepts of Maat were further formulated, promoted, and maintained by these individuals. Scribes in particular held prestigious positions in ancient Egyptian society as they were a primary means for the transmission of religious, political, and commercial information.

Although few were formally literate, writing was an important part of citizens&#x27; lives in Ancient Egypt, and scribes, for the large part, carried out literate functions for large masses of individuals. Since everyone was taxed, for example, their contributions were recorded by scribes. During periods of natural disasters, additionally, scribes worked on distant assignments, which were often in the form of letters. These letters were written and read by scribes for those who were not literate which enabled communication with superiors and families.

Written texts were often read aloud in public by scribes, who also wrote most of the letters, regardless of the sender&#x27;s writing ability. Thus, scribes were involved in both writing and reading the letters. Since scribes read the letters out loud in public, they could not use the first person to present the king&#x27;s voice. Thus, the texts were presented in the third person grammatical structure. However, much of ancient Egyptian writing was symbolic and operated on a much deeper level than narratives might suggest. Religious concerns, as well as the hierarchical structure of Ancient Egyptian society, created important distinctions between elite classes and everyone else. The political and ideological interests of the elite dominated and directed the majority of social and cultural life in Ancient Egypt. Rhetoric has also been acknowledged as playing a role in the maintenance of social hierarchies, with its priorities of maintaining harmony and social order.

Illiterate people had a priority to get scribes to their villages because this procedure allowed the government to limit excessive abuses by pointing out the importance of the complaints of the poor. Scribal instructional texts emphasize fair treatment of all peoples and how anyone who abuses their power is subject to punishment. Although this procedure was regulated by the local government, it helped provide the poor with the feeling that their petitions were put before higher officials&#x27; requests. Although the main responsibility of scribes was to compose the work, transfer it or communicate, some scribes added additional commentary. The scribe&#x27;s role in judicial system should also be taken into consideration. Local and insignificant crimes were usually led by a scribe or a foreman during the trial.

Thoth was the patron of scribes who is described as the one &quot;who reveals Maat and reckons Maat; who loves Maat and gives Maat to the doer of Maat&quot;. In texts such as the Instruction of Amenemope the scribe is urged to follow the precepts of Maat in his private life as well as his work. The exhortations to live according to Maat are such that these kinds of instructional texts have been described as &quot;Maat Literature&quot;.

=== Scribal schools ===
Scribal schools emerged during the Middle Kingdom Era (2060–1700 BCE). Although scribal practices had been implemented before this period, there is no evidence of &quot;systematic schooling&quot; occurring in a materialized institution during the Old Kingdom (2635–2155 BCE). Scribal schools were designed to transform people to the literate &quot;sesh&quot; or scribes who could function for society and bureaucracy. Therefore, literacy among ancient Egyptians revolved around the mastery of writing and reading in their specific purposes of conducting administration.

In scribal schools, students were selectively chosen based on the same date of birth around Egypt. Most of the apprentice scribes were boys, but some privileged girls received similar instruction as the boys in the scribal schools. They could either live at school with their peers or stay with their parents, depending on geographical adjacency. The students were taught two types of writing by their teachers who were priests: sacred writing and instructive writing. Sacred writing emphasized Maat and its moral as well as ethical values and instructions, while instructive writing covered specific discussion about land-measurement and arithmetic for evaluating the annual changes of river and land configurations; as well as for calculating tax, logging commercial business, and distributing supply.

Learning instructions in scribal schools were available for very young prospective students (5–10 years old students). This elementary instruction took 4 years to complete, and then, they could become apprentices of a tutor – an advanced level of education that elevated their scribal careers. In the elementary level, pupils received instructions from the tutors while sitting in circle around the tutors. The lessons were implemented in different fashions: reading was recited aloud or chanted, arithmetic was studied mutely, and writing was practiced by copying classical short literacy and the &quot;Miscellanies,&quot; a short composition specifically aimed to teach writing.

When learning writing, scribal apprentices were required to go over sequential steps. They firstly had to memorize a brief passage by chanted recital following the teachers. Later on, they were asked to copy some paragraphs to train their writing abilities, either on ostraca or wooden tablets. Once the instructors deemed the pupil had made some progress, they would assign the same first two steps toward Middle Egyptian manuscripts, consisting of classical work and instructions. After that, the same methods were implemented to Middle Egyptian texts, in which grammar and vocabulary took the most part.

Besides honing reading, writing, and arithmetic skills, students of scribal schools also learned other skills. Male students were involved in physical training, while female students were asked to practice singing, dancing, and musical instruments.

== As rhetorical concept ==

Although little mythology survives concerning the goddess Maat, she was the daughter of the Egyptian Sun god Ra; and the wife of Thoth, the god of wisdom who invented writing, which directly connects &quot;Maat&quot; to ancient Egyptian rhetoric. &quot;Maat&quot; (which is associated with solar, lunar, astral, and the river Nile&#x27;s movements) is a concept based on humanity&#x27;s attempt to live in a natural harmonic state. &quot;Maat&quot; is associated with the judgment of the deceased and whether a person has done &quot;what is right&quot; in their life. Thus, to do &quot;Maat&quot; was to act in a manner unreproachable or inculpable. So revered was the concept of &quot;Maat&quot; that Egyptian kings would often pay tribute to gods, offering small statues of &quot;Maat&quot;, indicating that they were successfully upholding the universal order: the interconnection among the cosmic, divine, natural, and human realms. When rhetors are attempting to achieve &quot;balance&quot; in their arguments, they are practicing &quot;Maat.&quot;

George Kennedy, a history of rhetoric scholar, defines rhetoric as the transmission of emotion and thought through a system of symbols, including words, to influence the emotions and thoughts of others. &quot;Maat&quot; sought to influence its audience to action as well. Scholars have closely examined this relationship between ancient Egyptian rhetoric and the concept of &quot;Maat&quot;, using three specific areas: 1) ancient Egyptian texts that actually taught &quot;Maat;&quot; 2) ancient Egyptian letter writing that embodied the performance of &quot;Maat;&quot; 3) ancient Egyptian letter writing that used &quot;Maat&quot; as persuasion

=== In ancient Egyptian texts ===
The Egyptian elite learned how to be part of the elite class through instructions text, such as &quot;The Instructions of Ptahhotep,&quot; that used &quot;Maat&quot; as the basis of concrete principles and guidelines for effective rhetoric. A passage from &quot;Ptahhotep&quot; presents Maat as instruction:

Another passage emphasizes the importance of Maat and how wisdom was also to be found among the women at the grindstones.

The lesson learned through &quot;Maat&quot; here is beneficence: the reader is advised to be benevolent and kind. An even stronger argument is being made – if you do not feed people, they will become unruly; on the other hand, if you take care of your people, they will take care of your memorial or tomb The excerpt from &quot;Phahhotep&quot; employs &quot;Maat&quot; to teach the reader how to be a more effective king. The Tale of The Eloquent Peasant is an extended discourse on the nature of Maat in which an officer under the direction of the King is described as taking the wealth of a nobleman and giving it to a poor man he had abused. Another text describes how the divine King:

=== Performance in ancient Egyptian letters ===
Letter writing became a significant part of the daily function of ancient Egyptian citizens. It became the means of communication between superiors and families; thus, Egyptians became incessant letter writers. Letters were not merely &quot;mailed&quot; to their recipients; they were &quot;performed&quot; by scribes who often wrote them on behalf of a king. Since language is the basis by which a community identifies itself and others, the scribes would perform &quot;Maat&quot; to build upon a community&#x27;s language to become more persuasive.

=== Persuasion in ancient Egyptian letters ===
James Herrick states that the major objective of rhetoric is for a rhetor to persuade (to alter) an audience&#x27;s view to that of the rhetor; for example, an attorney uses rhetoric to persuade a jury that his/her client is innocent of a crime. &quot;Maat&quot; in letters written to subordinates to persuade allegiance to them and the pharaoh; subordinates would evoke &quot;Maat&quot; to illustrate a desire to please. To directly disagree with a superior was considered highly inappropriate; instead, inferior citizens would indirectly evoke &quot;Maat&quot; to assuage a superior&#x27;s ego to achieve the desired outcome.

===Temples===
The earliest evidence for a dedicated temple is in the New Kingdom (c. 1569 to 1081 BCE) era, despite the great importance placed on Maat. Amenhotep III commissioned a temple in the Karnak complex, whilst textual evidence indicates that other temples of Maat were located in Memphis and at Deir el-Medina. The Maat temple at Karnak was also used by courts to meet regarding the robberies of the royal tombs during the rule of Ramesses IX.

==Afterlife==

===Weighing of the Heart===
In the Duat, the Egyptian underworld, the hearts of the dead were said to be weighed against her single &quot;Feather of Maat&quot;, symbolically representing the concept of Maat, in the &quot;Hall of Two Truths&quot;. This is why hearts were left in Egyptian mummies while their other organs were removed, as the heart (called &quot;ib&quot;) was seen as part of the Egyptian soul. If the heart was found to be lighter or equal in weight to the feather of Maat, the deceased had led a virtuous life and would go on to Aaru. Osiris came to be seen as the guardian of the gates of Aaru after he became part of the Egyptian pantheon and displaced Anubis in the Ogdoad tradition. A heart which was unworthy was devoured by the goddess Ammit and its owner condemned to remain in the Duat.

The weighing of the heart, as typically pictured on papyrus in the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, or in tomb scenes, shows Anubis overseeing the weighing and Ammit seated awaiting the results to consume those who failed. The image contains a balancing scale with an upright heart standing on one side and the Shu-feather standing on the other. Other traditions hold that Anubis brought the soul before the posthumous Osiris who performed the weighing. While the heart was weighed the deceased recited the 42 Negative Confessions as the Assessors of Maat looked on.

===Assessors of Maat===

The Assessors of Maat are the 42 deities listed in the Papyrus of Nebseni, to whom the deceased make the Negative Confession in the Papyrus of Ani. They represent the forty-two united nomes of Egypt, and are called &quot;the hidden Maati gods, who feed upon Maat during the years of their lives&quot;; i.e., they are the righteous minor deities who deserve offerings. As the deceased follows the set formula of Negative Confessions, he addresses each god directly and mentions the nome of which the god is a patron, in order to emphasize the unity of the nomes of Egypt.

===Funerary texts===
Egyptians were often entombed with funerary texts in order to be well equipped for the afterlife as mandated by ancient Egyptian funerary practices. These often served to guide the deceased through the afterlife, and the most famous one is the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; or Papyrus of Ani (known to the ancient Egyptians as &quot;The Book of Coming Forth by Day&quot;). The lines of these texts are often collectively called the &quot;Forty-Two Declarations of Purity&quot;. These declarations varied somewhat from tomb to tomb as they were tailored to the individual, and so cannot be considered a canonical definition of Maat. Rather, they appear to express each tomb owner&#x27;s individual practices in life to please Maat, as well as words of absolution from misdeeds or mistakes, made by the tomb owner in life, which could be declared as not having been done, and through the power of the written word, wipe particular misdeed from the afterlife record of the deceased. Many of the lines are similar, however, and paint a very unified picture of Maat.

The doctrine of Maat is represented in the declarations to Rekhti-merti-f-ent-Maat and the 42 Negative Confessions listed in the Papyrus of Ani. The following are translations by E. A. Wallis Budge.

===42 Negative Confessions (&quot;Papyrus of Ani&quot;)===

<text>Aaru (; , ), or the Field of Reeds (, &quot;sekhet-aaru&quot;), is the name for heavenly paradise in Egyptian mythology. Ruled over by Osiris, an Egyptian god, the location has been described as the of the Nile Delta.

Ancient Egyptians believed that the soul resided in the heart, and that each individual would therefore undergo a &quot;Weighing of the Heart&quot; in the afterlife; each human heart is weighed on a giant scale against an ostrich feather, which represents the concept of the goddess Maat. All souls that successfully balance the scales will be allowed to start a long and perilous journey to Aaru, where they will exist in peace and pleasure for eternity. Conversely, hearts that are heavy with evil will tumble from the scale pan and fall into the crocodilian jaws of the goddess Ammit. Any souls that are subject to Ammit&#x27;s &quot;second death&quot; are doomed to restlessness in the Duat.Qualifying souls undergo a long journey and face many perils before finally reaching Aaru. Once they arrive, they enter through a series of gates—the exact number of gates varies across sources, with given figures alternating between 15 gates and 21 gates. They are uniformly described as being guarded by deities and evil demons, and if the deceased passed through these final gates, they would be rowed across the water to the shores of the Field of Reeds.

Aaru was usually placed in the east, where the Sun rises, and has been described as comprising boundless reed fields, like those of the Nile Delta. Consequently, this ideal hunting and farming ground enabled qualified souls to live for eternity; more precisely, Aaru was envisaged as a series of islands covered in fields of reeds. The part where Osiris later dwelt is sometimes known as the &quot;field of offerings&quot; ().

== Resident deities ==
Aaru was also a residence for various deities worshiped by the deceased. Therefore, the deceased live eternally in the presence and amongst the gods, ruled over by the resident god, Osiris. As a result, the deceased ate and drank the same delicacies devoured by their gods.

<text>The Duat (, Egyptological pronunciation &quot;do-aht&quot;), also spelled Tuat, or called Amenthes () or Te (), is the underworld in ancient Egyptian mythology. It has been represented in hieroglyphs as a star-in-circle: 𓇽. The god Osiris was believed to be the lord of the underworld. He was the first mummy as depicted in the Osiris myth and he personified rebirth and life after death. The underworld was also the residence of various other gods along with Osiris.

The geography of the &quot;Duat&quot; is similar in outline to the world the Egyptians knew: There are realistic features like rivers, islands, fields, lakes, mounds and caverns, but there were also fantastic lakes of fire, walls of iron, and trees of turquoise. In the &quot;Book of Two Ways&quot; (a Coffin Text) there is even a map-like image of the &quot;Duat&quot;.

== Resident souls, gods, and demons ==
The &quot;Duat&quot; was also a residence for various gods, including Osiris, Anubis, Thoth, Horus, Hathor, and Maat, who all appear to the dead soul as it makes its way toward judgement. In spite of the many demon-like inhabitants of the &quot;Duat&quot;, it is not equivalent to the conceptions of Hell in the Abrahamic religions, in which souls are condemned with fiery torment. The absolute punishment for the wicked, in ancient Egyptian thought, was the denial of an afterlife to the deceased, ceasing to exist in the intellectual form (: ; Egypt. Pron.: Akh). The grotesque spirits of the underworld were not evil, but rather acted as directed by the gods, to provide the various ordeals that the deceased had to face.

== Underworld route of the sun ==

The &quot;Duat&quot; was the region through which the sun god Ra traveled from west to east each night, and it was where he battled Apep, who embodied the primordial chaos which the sun had to defeat in order to rise each morning and bring order back to the earth. It was also the place where people&#x27;s souls went after death for judgment, though that was not the full extent of the afterlife. Burial chambers formed touching-points between the mundane world and the &quot;Duat&quot;. As such, the west bank of the Nile was associated with the dead and funeral barges would mimic the sun god Ra&#x27;s journey through the sky during the day. The &quot;Akh&quot; (the conscious part of the soul) could use tombs to travel back and forth from the &quot;Duat&quot;.
Each night the sun god Ra travelled through the Duat, bringing revivification to the dead as their main benefit. When in the underworld he was in his ram-headed form. Ra travelled under the world upon his Atet barge from west to east; on the course of the underground journey, he was transformed from his aged Atum form into his young Khepri form – the new dawning sun. The role of the dead king, worshiped as a god, was also central to the mythology surrounding the concept of Duat, often depicted as being identical with Ra.

Along with the sun god the dead king travelled through the Duat, the Kingdom of Osiris, using the special knowledge he was supposed to possess, which was recorded in the Coffin Texts, that served as a guide to the hereafter not just for the king but for all deceased. According to the &quot;Amduat&quot;, the underworld consists of twelve regions signifying the twelve hours of the sun god&#x27;s journey through it, battling Apep in order to bring order back to the earth in the morning; as his rays illuminated the Duat during the journey, they revived the dead who occupied the underworld and let them enjoy life after death during that hour of the night when they were in the presence of the sun god, after which they resumed their sleep, waiting for the god&#x27;s return the following night.

== Place of the dead ==

The rest of the dead journeyed through the various parts of the Duat to be judged, but not to be unified with the sun god like the dead king. If the deceased was successfully able to pass various demons and challenges, then they would reach the &quot;Judgment of the dead&quot;. In this ritual, the deceased&#x27;s first task was to correctly address each of the forty-two Assessors of Maat by name, while reciting the sins they did not commit during their lifetime. After confirming that they were sinless, the heart of the deceased was weighed by Anubis against the feather of Maat, which represents truth and justice. Any heart that is heavier than the feather failed the test, and was rejected and eaten by Ammit, the devourer of souls, as these people were denied existence after death in the Duat. The souls that were lighter than the feather would pass this most important test, and would be allowed to travel toward Aaru, the &quot;Field of Reeds&quot;, an ideal version of the world they knew of, in which they would plough, sow, and harvest abundant crops.

== Sources ==
What is known of the &quot;Duat&quot; derives principally from funerary texts such as the &quot;Book of Gates&quot;, the &quot;Book of Caverns&quot;, the Coffin Texts, the &quot;Amduat&quot;, and the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;. Each of these documents fulfilled a different purpose and give a different conception of the &quot;Duat&quot;, and different texts could be inconsistent with one another. Surviving texts differ in age and origin, and there likely was never a single uniform conception of the &quot;Duat&quot;, as is the case of many theological concepts in ancient Egypt.

The &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; and Coffin Texts were prepared as guidebooks through the &quot;Duat&quot;s dangerous landscape and to a life as an &quot;ꜣḫ&quot; for people who had recently died. Emphasized in some of these texts are mounds and caverns, inhabited by gods, demons, or supernatural animals, which threatened the deceased along their journey. The purpose of the books is not to lay out a geography, but to describe a succession of rites of passage which the dead would have to pass to reach eternal life.

==In popular culture==
* The Duat appears as a major location in Rick Riordan&#x27;s &quot;The Kane Chronicles&quot; series. It is revealed in &quot;The Crown of Ptolemy&quot; to have connections to the Mist from Riordan&#x27;s &quot;Camp Half-Blood Chronicles&quot; series.
* The Duat appears as a secret level in the video game &quot;Spelunky 2&quot;.

* In the film series &quot;Night at the Museum&quot;, a group of underworld warrior deities appear in &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot; when Kahmunrah uses the combination to open the gate to the underworld and summon an army of Horus warriors.

<text>Nehebkau (also spelled Nehebu-Kau) was the primordial snake god in ancient Egyptian mythology. Although originally considered an evil spirit, he later functions as a funerary god associated with the afterlife. As one of the forty-two assessors of Ma’at, Nehebkau was believed to judge the deceased after death and provide their souls with ka – the part of the soul that distinguished the living from the dead.

Nehebkau was ultimately considered a powerful, benevolent and protective deity. In late mythology, he is described as a companion of the sun god Ra and an attendant of the deceased King. As he is so closely associated with the sun god, his name was evoked in magical spells for protection. His festival was widely celebrated throughout the Middle and New Kingdoms.

== Name ==
Nehebkau&#x27;s name – also spelled Neheb-Kau and Nhb-K3w – has been translated in many ways by Egyptologists. These translations include: &quot;that which gives Ka&quot;; &quot;he who harnesses the spirits&quot;; the &quot;overturner of doubles&quot;; &quot;collector of souls&quot;; &quot;provider of goods and foods&quot; and &quot;bestower of dignities&quot;.

== Mythology ==
Nehebkau is the &quot;original snake&quot; of Egyptian mythology, and was believed to be both an ancient and eternal god. Although he is occasionally represented as a son of Serket, Renenutet or Geb, he is sometimes believed to have simply &quot;emerged from the earth&quot;. He was believed to have lived in the Great Temple of Heliopolis, which was also the centre of worship for Re and Atum.

Nehebkau is a considerably powerful deity, which contemporary Egyptologist and author Richard Wilkinson credits to his demonic origins and snake-like qualities. After he swallows seven cobras in a myth, Nehebkau cannot be harmed by any magic, fire or water. In an early myth, he demonstrates an ability to breathe fire. Nehebkau first appears in the Pyramid Texts, and he is described as an evil, long and winding serpent who devoured human souls in the afterlife. In this context, he is believed to be an enemy of the sun god, and Re is said to have built his sun boats to be able to be pushed by the wind in order to escape Nehebkau&#x27;s many coils.

Nehebkau was later honoured among other dangerous gods as one of the 42 judges in the Court of Maat, judging the innocence of deceased souls. Additionally, orientalist Professor Wilhelm Max Muller describes Nehebkau to have personally guarded the gates of the underworld. 

As a snake god, Nehebkau was also considered a dangerous, furious and fearsome demon.

In the Coffin Texts, however, the ancient god Atum places his fingernail against a nerve in Nehebkau&#x27;s spine, calming his chaotic and fearsome nature.

Throughout and following the Coffin Texts, Nehebkau is considered a benevolent and helpful deity who may be befriended by gods and men and enlisted into service. After this transformation, he appears as a servant and partner to the sun god Re, and is said to provide food and assistance to the deceased King in the afterlife. In this position, he became increasingly powerful and important, eventually assuming Re&#x27;s role as a King of The Sky.

It is in this peaceful form that he mostly appears in Egyptian mythologies, and he was often evoked as a protective god in religious rituals, amulets and spells.

== Roles ==

=== Funerary God ===

As a funerary god and one of the forty-two judges in the Court of Maat, Nehebkau played a significant role in the Ancient Egyptian perception of the afterlife. As well as guarding the underworld, he was occasionally represented as a personal guard of Osiris.

When a deceased spirit enters the afterlife in Ancient Egyptian mythology, the most important stage is their trial in the Court of Maat, also known as the Law-Court of Osiris or the Dead Court. This tribunal consisted of forty-two fearsome deities who represented all possible types of evil, and to whom the deceased had to declare their innocence.

Nehebkau had a specific role in examining the individual&#x27;s purity and sinlessness, and he was specifically responsible for protecting the neck and throat of the deceased.

Once the deceased is justified and found innocent by the Court, Nehebkau is believed to have absolved the soul of sin and provided the deceased with food and drink. He additionally nourishes the deceased with ka – the &#x27;life force&#x27; of the individual - allowing their spirit to endure in the afterlife.

=== Attendant of Re ===
After he was subdued by Atum, Nehebkau was characterised as benevolent, beautiful and peaceful. It is in this state that he became the servant and partner of the sun god Re. In later myths, he assists Re in his moving of the morning boat through the sky to the east and throughout the flight of the day. In the Book of The Dead, this passage is described as making all people happy, filling hearts with &quot;joy and justice&quot;.

Additionally, Nehebkau is said to have served the dead Kings in this period: providing food, transmitting messages and intervening with other deities on their behalf.

=== Successor of Re ===
Nehebkau eventually assumed Re&#x27;s role in the afterlife: becoming &quot;the King of Heaven and ruler of the Two Lands&quot; and bestowing crowns, ka and other desirable qualities upon the spirits of the deceased. He acted as a mediator between the deceased and the gods, and was additionally responsible for assigning the dead their positions in the afterlife.

== Relationship to other gods ==

Nehebkau continuously appears alongside the sun god Re, as an assistant, companion and successor.

As an assessor of Maat in the Court of Osiris, he was also associated with Osiris himself: the god of the dead, fertility and the afterlife. Although not all of the 42 assessors have been identified by scholars, Wilkerson considers significant deities such as the ibis Thoth and crocodile Sobek to be included in the tribunal, and these gods can therefore be considered associates of Nehebkau.

As a snake deity, he was associated with and likely modelled after the great snake Apep — the enemy of Ra and embodiment of chaos in Egyptian myth.

Additionally, as a visiting god of Heliopolis and an ancient deity, Nehebkau was often associated with Atum: the creator god who calms his chaotic nature.

Nehebkau was represented as a consort of the minor goddess Nehmtaway, who is also a known partner of the wisdom god Thoth. She was depicted as a goddess holding an infant, with a distinguishing headdress shaped like a sistrum - an Ancient Egyptian musical instrument.

He sometimes appeared as a consort to the scorpion goddess Serket, who protected the deceased King and was often evoked to cure poison and scorpion stings. Some myths also describe Nehebkau as Serket&#x27;s son.

Alternatively, he was believed to be the son of the earth god Geb. This is common with Egyptian snake gods and associated with the imagery of snakes crawling across the earth. When Geb is represented as his father, Nehebkau&#x27;s mother is considered to be the harvest goddess Renenutet: the ‘good snake’ who ensured bountiful fields, harvests and kitchens for the living and nourished the kas of the dead.

The image of Nehebkau also appeared on depictions of the thrones of feline goddess Sekhmet and Bastet. Wilkerson theorises that this iconography would have likely symbolised his protection over them.

== Iconography ==

Nehebkau is most often represented in Ancient Egyptian art, carvings and statues as an anthropomorphised snake: half human and half serpent. He is also commonly depicted as a falcon headed snake with human arms and legs and an erect penis, depicted as such in multiple hypocephali.

However, early texts and mythologies usually represented Nehebkau as a full serpent with a long body and multiple coils. It is in this form that often appears on the sides of divine thrones, likely in reference to his protective qualities and powerful nature.

In later periods, he appeared in a semi-anthropromophised form, as a man with the head and tail of a serpent or a serpent with human arms or legs. In this form he appears on amulets, small statues and plaques, with his arms &quot;raised to the mouth to proffer small vessels for food or drink,&quot; reflecting his function in the afterlife.

Nehebkau was occasionally shown as having two heads on two separate necks, and a third head on his tail supported by the figure of a man. Egyptologist Magali Massiera suggests that the two heads could be a representation of his dual good and evil nature, as well as his ability to simultaneously attack from two directions at once. In one artifact from Heliopolis, he appears as an eight headed snake.

These detailed descriptions of his appearance were common for guardians of the underworld, and were done so Nehekbau could be recognised by the deceased. Occasionally, Nehebkau is represented with the features of other snake demons: such as multiple heads and wings.

== Worship ==
Although there was no specific priesthood associated with Nehebkau, scholars including Wilkinson consider it likely that he was widely worshipped in popular religion.

This worship was likely centred at his temple in Herakleopolis, although its exact location is rarely mentioned in sources. Nehebkau was also often associated with the Great Temple of Heliopolis, where he may have had a funerary chapel, as well as a statue that dates back to the reign of King Ramses II.

Nehebkau was also depicted in many amulets from the New Kingdom&#x27;s third intermediate period and later. These amulets were often found in burials, which indicates a belief that Nehebkau would protect the deceased through their journey to the underworld. Kalloniatis also associates these amulets with Nehebkau&#x27;s ability to sustain ka in spirits and nourish the deceased with food and drink in the afterlife. 

His image also appears on amulets designed to protect against poison, snake-bites and scorpion venom.

=== Magic and Spells ===
Anti-snake spells are incredibly common in Egyptian texts, appearing in the Pyramid Texts, Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead, alongside other spells designed to repel dangerous animals. Many magical objects are inscribed with scenes of benevolent deities protecting humanity from snakes.

After becoming associated with Ra, Nehebkau&#x27;s name was often evoked in magical spells to function as a magical protector. His image was depicted as a protective deity on some ivory wands.

== Festivals ==
Nehebkau&#x27;s festival was recorded as occurring thirty-two times in the New Kingdom, but is known to have been celebrated since at least the Middle Kingdom.

The exact date of the festival is contested by scholars: it may have been celebrated nine days after the festival of ploughing the earth, on the first day of the first month of the winter season or alternatively during the coronation of the King during the Ramesside period.

Individuals would often celebrate this festival by eating hsjitt plants and cakes made of khersait plants. The festival is believed by researcher Sharon LaBorde to have been a feast celebrating redemption and rebirth; potentially associated with the lion goddess Sekhmet.

<text>Renenūtet (also transliterated Ernūtet, Renen-wetet, Renenet) was a goddess of grain, grapes, nourishment and the harvest in the ancient Egyptian religion. The importance of the harvest caused people to make many offerings to Renenutet during harvest time. 
Initially, her cult was centered in Terenuthis. Renenutet was depicted as a cobra or as a woman with the head of a cobra.
The verbs &quot;to fondle, to nurse, or rear&quot; help explain the name Renenutet. This goddess was a &quot;nurse&quot; who took care of the pharaoh from birth to death. She was also called &quot;the mistress of provisions&quot;, &quot;Renenutet mistress of the offerings&quot;, &quot;Renenutet mistress of the food&quot;, and &quot;Renenutet the venerable of the double granary&quot;, and &quot;who maintains everybody&quot;.

She was the female counterpart of Shai, &quot;destiny&quot;, who represented the positive destiny of the child. Renenutet was called Thermouthis or Hermouthis in Greek. She embodied the fertility of the fields (both the vegetation and the soil itself) and was the protector of the royal office and power. She also came to be seen as a bringer of happiness, and was strongly associated with milk and breastfeeding.

Offerings to Renenutet were depicted in Egyptian wine making scenes, and shrines to her were set up in vineyards. Images of her were found in kitchens, near ovens, in granaries, and in cellars. These images often invoked her to protect food stores against insects, mice, and snakes, not just as a provider of food. Her image also appears on stamps and stoppers for wine containers.

Sometimes, as the goddess of nourishment, Renenutet was seen as having a husband, Sobek. He was represented as the Nile River, the annual flooding of which deposited the fertile silt that enabled abundant harvests. The temple of Medinet Madi is dedicated to both Sobek and Renenutet. It is a small and decorated building in the Faiyum.

More usually, Renenutet was seen as the mother of Nehebkau who occasionally was also represented as a snake. When considered the mother of Nehebkau, Renenutet was seen as having a husband, Geb, who represented the earth.

She was the mother of the god Nepri.

Later, as a snake goddess worshiped over the whole of Lower Egypt, Renenutet was increasingly associated with Wadjet, Lower Egypt&#x27;s powerful protector and another snake goddess represented as a cobra. Eventually Renenutet was identified as an alternate form of Wadjet, whose gaze was said to slaughter enemies. Wadjet was the cobra shown on the crown of the pharaohs. 

Renenutet was also identified with Meretseger, a cobra goddess of the Theban necropolis, and was syncretized with Isis.

==Festivals==
The Festival of Renenutet was an annual Egyptian celebration held between the end of Pharmouthi and the beginning of Pashons. It marked the first day of the harvest season and symbolically linked the birth of child gods to the gathering of new crops. These deities were perceived as providers of fertility and their cyclical rebirth as young solar gods ensured the regeneration of the sun. The festival also incorporated the cult of the reigning monarch, who was identified with the divine child of the local triad, thus reinforcing the legitimacy of royal succession.

The festival’s origins can be traced back to at least the New Kingdom. It was originally seen as the day when Renenutet gave birth to her son Nepri, the god of grain. In Thebes, several child deities were venerated, including Khonsu-pa-khered, Harsiese (Opet Temple), Harpre-pa-khered (North Karnak and Armant), and Somtous (Ptah Temple and Deir el-Medina). It became a festivael particularly in honor of Khonsu, after whom the month of Pashons was named.

<text>Serket () is the goddess of healing venomous stings and bites in Egyptian mythology, originally the deification of the scorpion. Her family life is unknown, but she is sometimes credited as the daughter of Neith and Khnum, making her a sister to Sobek and Apep.

Scorpion stings lead to paralysis and Serket&#x27;s name describes this, as it means &quot;(she who) tightens the throat&quot;; however, Serket&#x27;s name also can be read as meaning &quot;(she who) causes the throat to breathe&quot; and so, as well as being seen as stinging the unrighteous, Serket was seen as one who could cure scorpion stings and the effects of other venoms such as snakebites.

In the art of ancient Egypt, Serket was depicted as a scorpion (a symbol found on the earliest artifacts of the culture, such as from Naqada III) or to have the body of a scorpion but the head of a woman or as a woman with a scorpion on her head. Although Serket does not appear to have had any temples, she had a sizable number of priests in many communities.

One of the most dangerous species of scorpion, the deathstalker (&quot;Leiurus quinquestriatus&quot;) resides in North Africa and its sting may kill, so Serket was considered a highly important goddess and sometimes she was considered by pharaohs to be their patron. Her close association with the early rulers implies that she was their protector, notably Scorpion I and Scorpion II.

As the protector against venom and snakebite, Serket often was said to protect the deities from Apep, the great snake-demon of evil, sometimes being depicted as the guard when Apep was captured.

As many of the venomous creatures of Egypt could prove fatal, Serket also was considered a protector of the dead, particularly being associated with venoms and fluids causing stiffening. She was thus said to be the protector of the tents of embalmers and of the canopic jar associated with venom—the jar of the intestine—which was deified later as Qebehsenuef, one of the four sons of Horus.

As the guard of one of the canopic jars and a protector, Serket gained a strong association with Neith, Isis, and Nephthys, who also performed similar functions. Eventually, Serket began to be identified with Isis, sharing imagery and parentage, until finally, Serket was said to be merely an aspect of Isis, whose cult had become dominant.

It has been suggested that Serket&#x27;s identification with a scorpion may be a misinterpretation of the determinative of her name and animal associated with her and that could refer not to a scorpion, but rather to a water scorpion (Nepidae). According to this hypothesis, Serket is referred to as &quot;she who gives breath&quot; because of the way water scorpions seem to breathe underwater. The appearance of a waterscorpion must have made it be associated with the scorpion, therefore the use of the goddess for curing scorpion stings and other venomous creatures or maybe exactly because she &quot;causes to breathe&quot;, not for the physical similarities of the creatures.

<text>The Imiut fetish (&quot;jmy-wt&quot;) is a religious object that has been documented throughout the history of ancient Egypt. It was a stuffed, headless animal skin, often of a feline or bull. This fetish was tied by the tail to a pole, terminating in a lotus bud and inserted into a stand. The item was present in ancient Egyptian funerary rites from at least the earliest dynasties. Although its origin and purpose is unknown, the imiut fetish dates as far back as the First Dynasty (3100–2890 BC).

==History==
The earliest known depiction of the &quot;jmy-wt&quot; fetish is on a Predynastic lug handle dating to Naqada IIc-d, which appears to show the procedure by which intestines were extracted from a sacrificial bird and tied to the fetish. In the First Dynasty, the fetish appears on seals and labels during the reigns of kings Hor-Aha, Djer, Djet, and Den, where the &quot;jmy-wt&quot; is associated with ritual killings of prisoners. Another example found in 1914 by an expedition of the Metropolitan Museum of Art near the pyramid of Senusret I (c. 1971-1928 BCE) was placed in a shrine.

There are depictions of the imiut fetish on ancient Egyptian temples, and sometimes there were models of it included with the funerary equipment, most notably the two found in the burial chamber of Tutankhamun by Howard Carter. The fetish was later connected to the god Anubis and mummification around the Fourth Dynasty, so it is sometimes called the Anubis fetish.

== Meaning ==
Logan suggests that the &quot;jmy.wt&quot; has its origin as a standard associated with kingship and transition, a pole upon which the intestines of a ritual animal sacrifice were hung. This he connects to an etymology &quot;jmy.wt&quot; &quot;that which is inside&quot;, analogous to &quot;jmyw&quot; &quot;tumor&quot;. In this scenario, the name was later reanalyzed as a reference to embalming after the association with Anubis.

<text>Kherty is an ancient Egyptian deity. Despite being archaeologically attested since the early 2nd Dynasty, his original mythological role during this era is unclear. Kherty was an Egyptian god of the Duat. The earliest mythological descriptions of Kherty&#x27;s role do not appear until the 6th Dynasty in the Pyramid Texts.

== Description ==
The earliest depictions of Kherty appear during the early 2nd dynasty, under king (pharaoh) Hotepsekhemwy and Raneb. He is normally shown as a recumbent and mummified ram. In rare instances he was pictured as a bull or a lion. The figurine is always guided by the hieroglyphic signs of a shamble and a bread loaf, giving a reading as &quot;kherty&quot;.

== Cult ==
Kherty was worshipped since the early 2nd dynasty, his name appears first time on stone bowls of king Sneferka. Stone bowl inscriptions from the reign of king Peribsen mention first time the title &quot;god servant of Kherty&quot; (Egypt. &quot;hem-netjer Kherty&quot;). The main centre of the Kherty cult was located at Letopolis (today Ausim), a second cult centre was later founded at &quot;Nesat&quot; (exact location unknown).

== Mythology ==

Kherty was a contradicting character: The pyramid texts reveal that he was worshipped at one side as a guide, who brought the deceased king safely to &quot;the yonder site&quot; by &quot;being the ferryman&quot;. He also protected the deceased against various demons (named &quot;inmetjw&quot; in the texts) sent by Seth. The deceased king was then brought to his destination by Ra. On the other site, however, Kherty was feared as death in persona, a god that &quot;lives on the heart of men&quot;, making them stop pounding. The pyramid texts reveal that Kherty attacked the physical heart (&quot;khat(jw)&quot;) of the dying peoples, not the metaphysical, symbolic heart (&quot;jb&quot;) as the &quot;seat of thoughts and feelings&quot;. For this reason, a lot of spells and prayers were addressed to Kherty in attempt to befriend and please him. Other prayers beg Ra to &quot;take the deceased king away from Kherty&quot;. These prayers also mention Osiris, the judge of the underworld. Thus, Kherty and Osiris were mythologically connected to each other.

Kherty is not mentioned in the famous Coffin Texts of Middle Kingdom period. Instead, he is replaced by a god Aker, who is now the ferryman. In the prayers of the Book of the Dead, Kherty is described as a guard who guides the celestial bark of Ra.

<text>In ancient Egyptian religion, Apis or Hapis, alternatively spelled Hapi-ankh, was a sacred bull or multiple sacred bulls worshiped in the Memphis region, identified as the son of Hathor, a primary deity in the pantheon of ancient Egypt. Initially, he was assigned a significant role in her worship, being sacrificed and reborn. Later, Apis also served as an intermediary between humans and other powerful deities (originally Ptah, later Osiris, then Atum).

The Apis bull was an important sacred animal to the ancient Egyptians. As with the other sacred beasts, Apis&#x27; importance increased over the centuries. During colonization of the conquered Egypt, Greek and Roman authors had much to say about Apis, the markings by which the black calf was recognized, the manner of his conception by a ray from heaven, his house at Memphis (with a court for his deportment), the mode of prognostication from his actions, his death, the mourning at his death, his costly burial, and the rejoicings throughout the country when a new Apis was found. Auguste Mariette&#x27;s excavation of the Serapeum of Saqqara revealed the tombs of more than sixty animals, ranging from the time of Amenhotep III to the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Originally, each animal was buried in a separate tomb with a chapel built above it. From Ramesses II onward, bulls were interred in interconnected underground galleries.

==History of worship==
Worship of an Apis bull, experienced by ancient Egyptians as holy, has been known since the First Dynasty in Memphis, while worship of the Apis as a proper god, at least according to Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, seems to be a later adoption, purportedly started during the reign of king &quot;Kaiechos&quot; (possibly Nebra) of the Second Dynasty.

Apis is named on very early monuments, but little is known of the divine animal before the New Kingdom. Ceremonial burials of bulls indicate that ritual sacrifice was part of the worship of the early cow deities, Hathor and Bat, and a bull might represent her offspring, a king who became a deity after death. He was entitled &quot;the renewal of the life&quot; of the Memphite deity Ptah: but after death, he became Osorapis, i.e. the Osiris Apis, just as dead humans were assimilated to Osiris, the ruler of the underworld. This Osorapis was identified with Serapis of the late Hellenistic period and may well be identical with him. Creating parallels to their own religious beliefs, ancient Greek writers identified Apis as an incarnation of Osiris, ignoring the connection with Ptah.

Apis was the most popular of three great bull cults of ancient Egypt, the others being the cults of Mnevis and Buchis. All are related to the worship of Hathor or Bat, similar primary goddesses separated by region until unification that eventually merged as Hathor. The worship of Apis was continued by the Greeks and after them by the Romans, and lasted until almost 400 CE.

== Herald of Ptah ==

This animal was chosen because it symbolized the courageous heart, great strength, and fighting spirit of the king. Apis came to being considered a manifestation of the king, as bulls were symbols of strength and fertility, qualities that are closely linked with kingship. &quot;Strong bull of his mother Hathor&quot; was a common title for Egyptian gods and male kings, being unused for women serving as king, such as Hatshepsut.

As early as the time of the Narmer Palette, the king is depicted with a bovine tail on one side, and a bull is seen knocking down the walls of a city on the other.

Occasionally, Apis was pictured with the sun-disk symbol of his mother, Hathor, between his horns, being one of few deities ever associated with her symbol. When the disk was depicted on his head with his horns below and the triangular marking on his forehead, an ankh was suggested. That symbol always was closely associated with Hathor.

Early on, Apis was the herald () of Ptah, the chief deity in the area around Memphis. As a manifestation of Ptah, Apis also was considered to be a symbol of the king, embodying the qualities of kingship. In the region where Ptah was worshiped, cattle exhibited white patterning on their mainly black bodies, and so a belief grew up that the Apis calf had to have a certain set of markings suitable to its role. It was required to have a white triangular marking upon its forehead, a white Egyptian vulture wing outline on its back, a scarab mark under its tongue, a white crescent moon shape on its right flank, and double hairs on his tail.

The calf that matched these markings was selected from the herds, brought to a temple, given a harem of cows, and worshiped as an aspect of Ptah. The cow who was his mother was believed to have conceived him by a flash of lightning from the heavens, or from moonbeams. She also was treated specially, and given a special burial. At the temple, Apis was used as an oracle, his movements being interpreted as prophecies. His breath was believed to cure disease and his presence to bless those around with strength. A window was created in the temple through which he could be viewed and, on certain holidays, he was led through the streets of the city, bedecked with jewelry and flowers.

==Burial==

Details of the mummification ritual of the sacred bull are written within the Apis papyrus. Sometimes the body of the bull was mummified and fixed in a standing position on a foundation made of wooden planks.

By the New Kingdom period, the remains of the sacred bulls were interred at the cemetery of Saqqara. The earliest known burial in Saqqara was performed in the reign of Amenhotep III by his son Thutmose; afterward, seven more bulls were buried nearby. Ramesses II initiated Apis burials in what now is known as the Serapeum, an underground complex of burial chambers at Saqqara for the sacred bulls, a site used throughout the rest of Ancient Egyptian history into the reign of Cleopatra.

Khaemweset, the priestly son of Ramesses II (), excavated a great gallery to be lined with the tomb chambers; another similar gallery was added by Psamtik I. The careful documentation of the ages of the animals in the later instances, with the regnal dates for their birth, enthronement, and death have thrown much light on the chronology from the Twenty-second Dynasty onward. The name of the mother cow and the place of the calf&#x27;s birth are often recorded. The sarcophagi are of immense size and the burial must have entailed enormous expense. It is remarkable, therefore, that the ancient religious leaders contrived to bury one of the animals in the fourth year of Cambyses II.

The Apis was a protector of the deceased and linked to the pharaoh. Horns embellish some of the tombs of ancient pharaohs and Apis often was depicted on private coffins as a powerful protector. As a form of Osiris, ruler of the underworld, it was believed that to be under the protection of Apis would give the person control over the four winds in the afterlife.

==From animal to human==

According to Arrian, Apis was one of the Egyptian deities Alexander the Great propitiated by offering a sacrifice during his seizure of Ancient Egypt from the Persians. After Alexander&#x27;s death, his general Ptolemy I Soter made efforts to integrate Egyptian religion with that of the new Hellenic rulers. Ptolemy&#x27;s policy was to find a deity that might win the reverence of both groups, despite the curses of the Egyptian religious leaders against the deities of the previous foreign rulers (i.e. Set, lauded by the Hyksos). Without success, Alexander had attempted to use Amun for this purpose, but that deity was more prominent in Upper Egypt and not for those in Lower Egypt, where the Greeks had stronger influence. Since the Greeks had little respect for animal-headed deities, a Greek statue was created as an idol and proclaimed as an anthropomorphic equivalent of the highly popular Apis. It was named &quot;Aser-hapi&quot; (i.e. &quot;Osiris-Apis&quot;), which became Serapis, and later was said to represent Osiris fully, rather than just his Ka.

The earliest mention of a &quot;Serapis&quot; is in the authentic death scene of Alexander, from the royal diaries. Here, &quot;Serapis&quot; has a temple at Babylon, and is of such importance that he alone is named as being consulted on behalf of the dying Alexander. The presence of this temple in Babylon radically altered perceptions of the mythologies of this era, although it has been discovered that the unconnected Babylonian deity Ea was entitled &quot;Serapsi&quot;, meaning &quot;king of the deep&quot;, and it is Serapsi who is referred to in the diaries, not Serapis. The significance of this &quot;Serapsi&quot; in the Hellenic psyche, however, due to its involvement in Alexander&#x27;s death, also may have contributed to the choice of &quot;Osiris-Apis&quot; as the chief Ptolemaic deity during their occupation of Ancient Egypt.

According to Plutarch, Ptolemy stole the statue from Sinope, having been instructed in a dream by the Unknown God to bring the statue to Alexandria, where the statue was pronounced to be &quot;Serapis&quot; by two religious experts. Among those experts was one of the Eumolpidae, the ancient family from which the hierophant of the Eleusinian Mysteries traditionally had been chosen since before any historical records. The other expert supposedly was the scholarly Egyptian priest Manetho, which increased acceptability from both the Egyptians and the Greeks.

Plutarch may not be correct, however, as some Egyptologists assert that the &quot;Sinope&quot; in Plutarch&#x27;s report is the hill of Sinopeion, a name given to the site of an existing Serapeum at Memphis. Also, according to Tacitus, Serapis (i.e. Apis explicitly identified as Osiris in full) had been the tutelary deity of the village of Rhacotis, before it suddenly expanded into the great capital of &quot;Alexandria&quot;.

Being introduced by the Greeks, understandably, the statue depicted a fully human figure resembling Hades or Pluto, both being kings of the Greek underworld. The figure was enthroned with the &quot;modius&quot;, which is a basket or a grain-measure, on his head, a Greek symbol for the land of the dead. He also held a sceptre, indicating rulership, and Cerberus, gatekeeper of the underworld, rested at his feet. It also had what appeared to be a serpent at its base, fitting the Egyptian symbol of sovereignty, the uraeus.

With his (i.e., Osiris&#x27;) wife, Isis, and their son (at this point in history) Horus (in the form of &quot;Harpocrates&quot;), Serapis won an important place in the Greek world, reaching Ancient Rome, with Anubis being identified as Cerberus. 
The cult survived until 385, when Christians destroyed the Serapeum of Alexandria, and subsequently, the cult was forbidden by the Edict of Thessalonica.

== Modern use ==
The pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk uses Apis as its logo.

In modern day Egypt, an entire district of the city of Alexandria is named after the Apis bull.

<text>The Victoria and Albert Museum (abbreviated V&amp;A) in London is the world&#x27;s largest museum of applied arts, decorative arts and design, housing a permanent collection of over 2.8 million objects. It was founded in 1852 and named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

The V&amp;A is in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area known as &quot;Albertopolis&quot; because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial, and the major cultural institutions with which he was associated. These include the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Royal Albert Hall and Imperial College London. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. As with other national British museums, entrance is free.

The V&amp;A covers and 145 galleries. Its collection spans 5,000 years of art, from ancient history to the present day, from the cultures of Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa. However, the art of antiquity in most areas is not collected. The holdings of ceramics, glass, textiles, costumes, silver, ironwork, jewellery, furniture, medieval objects, sculpture, prints and printmaking, drawings and photographs are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world.

The museum owns the world&#x27;s largest collection of post-classical sculpture, with the holdings of Italian Renaissance sculpture being the largest outside Italy. The departments of Asia include art from South Asia, China, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The East Asian collections are among the best in Europe, with particular strengths in ceramics and metalwork, while the Islamic collection is amongst the largest in the Western world. Overall, it is one of the largest museums in the world.

Since 2001 the museum has embarked on a major £150m renovation programme. The new European galleries for the 17th century and the 18th century were opened on 9 December 2015. These restored the original Aston Webb interiors and host the European collections 1600–1815. The Young V&amp;A in east London is a branch of the museum, and a new branch in London – V&amp;A East – is being planned. The first V&amp;A museum outside London, V&amp;A Dundee opened on 15 September 2018.

==History==
=== Foundation ===
The Victoria and Albert Museum has its origins in the Great Exhibition of 1851. Henry Cole was the museum&#x27;s first director, he was also involved in the planning. Initially the V&amp;A was known as the Museum of Manufactures. The first opening to the general public was in May 1852 at Marlborough House. By September the collection had been transferred to Somerset House. At this stage, the collections covered both applied art and science. Several of the exhibits from the opening Exhibition were purchased by the museum to form the kernel of the V&amp;A collection.

By February 1854 discussions were underway to transfer the museum to the current site and the museum was renamed South Kensington Museum. In 1855 the German architect Gottfried Semper, at the request of Cole, produced a design for the museum, but it was rejected by the Board of Trade as too expensive. The current site was occupied by Brompton Park House, which was extended in 1857 to include the first refreshment rooms. The V&amp;A was the first museum in the world to provide researchers and guests a catering service.

The official opening by Queen Victoria was on 20 June 1857. In the following year, late-night openings were introduced, made possible by the use of gas lighting. In the words of museum director Cole gas lighting was introduced &quot;to ascertain practically what hours are most convenient to the working classes&quot;. To raise interest for the museum among the target audience, the museum exhibited its collections on both applied art and science. The museum aimed to provide educational resources and thus boost the productive industry.

In these early years the practical use of the collection was very much emphasised as opposed to that of &quot;High Art&quot; at the National Gallery and scholarship at the British Museum. George Wallis (1811–1891), the first Keeper of Fine Art Collection, passionately promoted the idea of wide art education through the museum collections. This led to the transfer to the museum of the School of Design that had been founded in 1837 at Somerset House; after the transfer, it was referred to as the Art School or Art Training School, later to become the Royal College of Art which finally achieved full independence in 1949. From the 1860s to the 1880s the scientific collections had been moved from the main museum site to various improvised galleries to the west of Exhibition Road. In 1893 the &quot;Science Museum&quot; had effectively come into existence when a separate director was appointed.
Queen Victoria returned to lay the foundation stone of the Aston Webb building (to the left of the main entrance) on 17 May 1899. It was during this ceremony that the change of name from &#x27;South Kensington Museum&#x27; to &#x27;Victoria and Albert Museum&#x27; was made public. Queen Victoria&#x27;s address during the ceremony, as recorded in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, ended: &quot;I trust that it will remain for ages a Monument of discerning Liberality and a Source of Refinement and Progress.&quot;

The exhibition which the museum organised to celebrate the centennial of the 1899 renaming, &quot;A Grand Design&quot;, first toured in North America from 1997 (Baltimore Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco), returning to London in 1999. To accompany and support the exhibition, the museum published a book, &quot;Grand Design&quot;, which it has made available for reading online on its website.

=== 1900–1950 ===
The opening ceremony for the Aston Webb building by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra took place on 26 June 1909. In 1914 the construction commenced of the Science Museum, signaling the final split of the science and art collections.

In 1939 on the outbreak of the Second World War, most of the collection was sent to a quarry in Wiltshire, to Montacute House in Somerset, or to a tunnel near Aldwych tube station, with larger objects remaining &quot;in situ&quot;, sand-bagged and bricked in. Between 1941 and 1944 some galleries were used as a school for children evacuated from Gibraltar. The South Court became a canteen, first for the Royal Air Force and later for Bomb Damage Repair Squads.

Before the return of the collections after the war, the &quot;Britain Can Make It&quot; exhibition was held between September and November 1946, attracting nearly a million-and-a-half visitors. This was organised by the Council of Industrial Design, established by the British government in 1944 &quot;to promote by all practicable means the improvement of design in the products of British industry&quot;. The success of this exhibition led to the planning of the Festival of Britain to be held in 1951. By 1948 most of the collections had been returned to the museum.

=== Since 1950 ===

In July 1973 as part of its outreach programme to young people, the V&amp;A became the first museum in Britain to present a rock concert. The V&amp;A presented a combined concert/lecture by the British progressive folk-rock band Gryphon, who explored the lineage of medieval music and instrumentation and related how those contributed to contemporary music 500 years later. This innovative approach to bringing young people to museums was a hallmark of the directorship of Sir Roy Strong and was subsequently emulated by some other British museums.

In the 1980s Strong renamed the museum as &quot;The Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Museum of Art and Design&quot;. Strong&#x27;s successor Elizabeth Esteve-Coll oversaw a turbulent period for the institution in which the museum&#x27;s curatorial departments were re-structured, leading to public criticism from some staff. Esteve-Coll&#x27;s attempts to make the V&amp;A more accessible included a criticised marketing campaign emphasising the café over the collection.

In 2001 the museum embarked on a major £150m renovation programme, called the &quot;FuturePlan&quot;. The plan involves redesigning all the galleries and public facilities in the museum that have yet to be remodelled. This is to ensure that the exhibits are better displayed, more information is available, access for visitors is improved, and the museum can meet modern expectations for museum facilities. A planned Spiral building was abandoned; in its place a new Exhibition Road Quarter designed by Amanda Levete&#x27;s AL_A was created. It features a new entrance on Exhibition Road, a porcelain-tiled courtyard (inaugurated in 2017 as the Sackler Courtyard and renamed the Exhibition Road Courtyard in 2022) and a new 1,100-square-metre underground gallery space (the Sainsbury Gallery) accessed through the Blavatnik Hall. The Exhibition Road Quarter project provided 6,400 square metres of extra space, which is the largest expansion at the museum in over 100 years. It opened on 29 June 2017.

In March 2018, it was announced that the Duchess of Cambridge would become the first royal patron of the museum. On 15 September 2018, the first V&amp;A museum outside London, V&amp;A Dundee, opened. The museum, built at a cost of £80.11m, is located on Dundee&#x27;s waterfront, and is focused on Scottish design, furniture, textiles, fashion, architecture, engineering and digital design. Although it uses the V&amp;A name, its operation and funding is independent of the V&amp;A.

The museum also runs the Young V&amp;A at Bethnal Green, which reopened on 1 July 2023; it used to run Apsley House, and also the Theatre Museum in Covent Garden. The Theatre Museum is now closed; the V&amp;A Theatre Collections are now displayed within the South Kensington building.

==Architecture==
Victorian parts of the building have a complex history, with piecemeal additions by different architects. Founded in May 1852, it was not until 1857 that the museum moved to its present site. This area of London, previously known as Brompton, had been renamed &#x27;South Kensington&#x27;. The land was occupied by Brompton Park House, which was extended, most notably by the &quot;Brompton Boilers&quot;, which were starkly utilitarian iron galleries with a temporary look and were later dismantled and used to build the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood. The first building to be erected that still forms part of the museum was the Sheepshanks Gallery in 1857 on the eastern side of the garden. Its architect was civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke, Royal Engineers, who was appointed by Cole. The next major expansions were designed by the same architect, the Turner and Vernon galleries built in 1858–1859 to house the eponymous collections (later transferred to the Tate Gallery) and now used as the picture galleries and tapestry gallery respectively. The North and South Courts were then built, both of which opened by June 1862. They now form the galleries for temporary exhibitions and are directly behind the Sheepshanks Gallery. On the very northern edge of the site is situated the Secretariat Wing; also built in 1862, this houses the offices and boardroom, etc. and is not open to the public.
An ambitious scheme of decoration was developed for these new areas: a series of mosaic figures depicting famous European artists of the Medieval and Renaissance period. These have now been removed to other areas of the museum. Also started were a series of frescoes by Lord Leighton: &quot;Industrial Arts as Applied to War&quot; 1878–1880 and &quot;Industrial Arts Applied to Peace&quot;, which was started but never finished. To the east of this were additional galleries, the decoration of which was the work of another designer, Owen Jones; these were the Oriental Courts (covering India, China and Japan), completed in 1863. None of this decoration survives.

Part of these galleries became the new galleries covering the 19th century, opened in December 2006. The last work by Fowke was the design for the range of buildings on the north and west sides of the garden. This includes the refreshment rooms, reinstated as the Museum Café in 2006, with the silver gallery above (at the time the ceramics gallery); the top floor has a splendid lecture theatre, although this is seldom open to the general public. The ceramic staircase in the northwest corner of this range of buildings was designed by F. W. Moody and has architectural details of moulded and coloured pottery. All the work on the north range was designed and built in 1864–69. The style adopted for this part of the museum was Italian Renaissance; much use was made of terracotta, brick and mosaic. This north façade was intended as the main entrance to the museum, with its bronze doors, designed by James Gamble and , having six panels, depicting Humphry Davy (chemistry); Isaac Newton (astronomy); James Watt (mechanics); Bramante (architecture); Michelangelo (sculpture); and Titian (painting); The panels thus represent the range of the museum&#x27;s collections. Godfrey Sykes also designed the terracotta embellishments and the mosaic in the pediment of the North Façade commemorating the Great Exhibition, the profits from which helped to fund the museum. This is flanked by terracotta statue groups by Percival Ball. This building replaced Brompton Park House, which could then be demolished to make way for the south range.
The interiors of the three refreshment rooms were assigned to different designers. The Green Dining Room (1866–68) was the work of Philip Webb and William Morris, and displays Elizabethan influences. The lower part of the walls is paneled in wood with a band of paintings depicting fruit and the occasional figure, with moulded plaster foliage on the main part of the wall and a plaster frieze around the decorated ceiling and stained-glass windows by Edward Burne-Jones. The Centre Refreshment Room (1865–77) was designed in a Renaissance style by James Gamble. The walls and even the Ionic columns in this room are covered in decorative and moulded ceramic tile, the ceiling consists of elaborate designs on enamelled metal sheets and matching stained-glass windows, and the marble fireplace was designed and sculpted by Alfred Stevens and was removed from Dorchester House prior to that building&#x27;s demolition in 1929. The Grill Room (1876–81) was designed by Sir Edward Poynter; the lower part of its walls consist of blue and white tiles with various figures and foliage enclosed by wood panelling, while above there are large tiled scenes with figures depicting the four seasons and the twelve months, painted by ladies from the Art School then based in the museum. The windows are also stained glass; there is an elaborate cast-iron grill still in place.

With the death of Captain Francis Fowke of the Royal Engineers, the next architect to work at the museum was Colonel (later Major General) Henry Young Darracott Scott, also of the Royal Engineers. He designed to the northwest of the garden the five-storey School for Naval Architects (also known as the science schools), now the Henry Cole Wing, in 1867–72. Scott&#x27;s assistant J. W. Wild designed the impressive staircase that rises the full height of the building. Made from Cadeby stone, the steps are in length, while the balustrades and columns are Portland stone. It is now used to jointly house the prints and architectural drawings of the V&amp;A (prints, drawings, paintings and photographs) and Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA Drawings and Archives Collections), and the Sackler Centre for arts education, which opened in 2008.

Continuing the style of the earlier buildings, various designers were responsible for the decoration. The terracotta embellishments were again the work of Godfrey Sykes, although sgraffito was used to decorate the east side of the building designed by F. W. Moody. A final embellishment was the wrought iron gates made as late as 1885 designed by Starkie Gardner. These lead to a passage through the building. Scott also designed the two Cast Courts (1870–73) to the southeast of the garden (the site of the &quot;Brompton Boilers&quot;); these vast spaces have ceilings in height to accommodate the plaster casts of parts of famous buildings, including Trajan&#x27;s Column (in two separate pieces). The final part of the museum designed by Scott was the Art Library and what is now the sculpture gallery on the south side of the garden, built in 1877–1883. The exterior mosaic panels in the parapet were designed by Reuben Townroe, who also designed the plaster work in the library. Sir John Taylor designed the bookshelves and cases. This was the first part of the museum to have electric lighting. This completed the northern half of the site, creating a quadrangle with the garden at its centre, but left the museum without a proper façade. In 1890 the government launched a competition to design new buildings for the museum, with architect Alfred Waterhouse as one of the judges; this would give the museum a new imposing front entrance.

===Edwardian period===
The main façade, built from red brick and Portland stone, stretches along Cromwell Gardens and was designed by Aston Webb after winning a competition in 1891 to extend the museum. Construction took place between 1899 and 1909. Stylistically it is a strange hybrid: although much of the detail belongs to the Renaissance, there are medieval influences at work. The main entrance, consisting of a series of shallow arches supported by slender columns and niches with twin doors separated by the pier, is Romanesque in form but Classical in detail. Likewise, the tower above the main entrance has an open work crown surmounted by a statue of fame, a feature of late Gothic architecture and a feature common in Scotland, but the detail is Classical. The main windows to the galleries are also mullioned and transomed, again a Gothic feature; the top row of windows are interspersed with statues of many of the British artists whose work is displayed in the museum.

Prince Albert appears within the main arch above the twin entrances, and Queen Victoria above the frame around the arches and entrance, sculpted by Alfred Drury. These façades surround four levels of galleries. Other areas designed by Webb include the Entrance Hall and Rotunda, the East and West Halls, the areas occupied by the shop and Asian Galleries, and the Costume Gallery. The interior makes much use of marble in the entrance hall and flanking staircases, although the galleries as originally designed were white with restrained classical detail and mouldings, very much in contrast to the elaborate decoration of the Victorian galleries, although much of this decoration was removed in the early 20th century.

===Post-war period===

The museum survived the Second World War with only minor bomb damage. The worst loss was the Victorian stained glass on the Ceramics Staircase, which was blown in when bombs fell nearby; pockmarks still visible on the façade of the museum were caused by fragments from the bombs.

In the immediate post-war years, there was little money available for other than essential repairs. The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. This involved flooring over Aston Webb&#x27;s main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006). Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600–1800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. To adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the façade.

===Recent years===
A few galleries were redesigned in the 1990s including the Indian, Japanese, Chinese, ironwork, the main glass galleries, and the main silverware gallery, which was further enhanced in 2002 when some of the Victorian decoration was recreated. This included two of the ten columns having their ceramic decoration replaced and the elaborate painted designs restored on the ceiling. As part of the 2006 renovation the mosaic floors in the sculpture gallery were restored—most of the Victorian floors were covered in linoleum after the Second World War. After the success of the British Galleries, opened in 2001, it was decided to embark on a major redesign of all the galleries in the museum; this is known as &quot;FuturePlan&quot;, and was created in consultation with the exhibition designers and masterplanners Metaphor. The plan is expected to take about ten years and was started in 2002. To date several galleries have been redesigned, notably, in 2002: the main Silver Gallery, Contemporary; in 2003: Photography, the main entrance, The Painting Galleries; in 2004: the tunnel to the subway leading to South Kensington tube station, new signage throughout the museum, architecture, V&amp;A and RIBA reading rooms and stores, metalware, Members&#x27; Room, contemporary glass, and the Gilbert Bayes sculpture gallery; in 2005: portrait miniatures, prints and drawings, displays in Room 117, the garden, sacred silver and stained glass; in 2006: Central Hall Shop, Islamic Middle East, the new café, and sculpture galleries. Several designers and architects have been involved in this work. Eva Jiřičná designed the enhancements to the main entrance and rotunda, the new shop, the tunnel and the sculpture galleries. Gareth Hoskins was responsible for contemporary and architecture, Softroom, Islamic Middle East and the Members&#x27; Room, McInnes Usher McKnight Architects (MUMA) were responsible for the new Cafe and designed the new Medieval and Renaissance galleries which opened in 2009.

====Garden====

The central garden was redesigned by Kim Wilkie and opened as the John Madejski Garden on 5 July 2005. The design is a subtle blend of the traditional and modern: the layout is formal; there is an elliptical water feature lined in stone with steps around the edge which may be drained to use the area for receptions, gatherings or exhibition purposes. This is in front of the bronze doors leading to the refreshment rooms. A central path flanked by lawns leads to the sculpture gallery. The north, east and west sides have herbaceous borders along the museum walls with paths in front which continues along the south façade. In the two corners by the north façade, there is planted an American Sweetgum tree. The southern, eastern and western edges of the lawns have glass planters which contain orange and lemon trees in summer, which are replaced by bay trees in winter.

At night both the planters and the water feature may be illuminated, and the surrounding façades lit to reveal details normally in shadow. Especially noticeable are the mosaics in the loggia of the north façade. In summer a café is set up in the southwest corner. The garden is also used for temporary exhibits of sculpture; for example, a sculpture by Jeff Koons was shown in 2006. It has also played host to the museum&#x27;s annual contemporary design showcase, the V&amp;A Village Fete, since 2005.

====Exhibition Road Quarter====

In 2011 the V&amp;A announced that London-based practice AL A had won an international competition to construct a gallery beneath a new entrance courtyard on Exhibition Road. Planning for the scheme was granted in 2012. It replaced the proposed extension designed by Daniel Libeskind with Cecil Balmond but abandoned in 2004 after failing to receive funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

The Exhibition Road Quarter opened in 2017, with a new entrance providing access for visitors from Exhibition Road. A new courtyard, the Sackler Courtyard, has been created behind the Aston Webb Screen, a colonnade built in 1909 to hide the museum&#x27;s boilers. The colonnade was kept but the wall in the lower part was removed in the construction to allow public access to the courtyard. The new 1,200-square meter courtyard is the world&#x27;s first all-porcelain courtyard, which is covered with 11,000 handmade porcelain tiles in fifteen different linear patterns glazed in different tone. A pavilion of Modernist design with glass walls and an angular roof covered with 4,300 tiles is located at the corner and contains a cafe. Skylights on the courtyard provide natural light for the stairwell and the exhibition space located below the courtyard created by digging 15m into the ground. The Sainsbury Gallery&#x27;s column-less space at 1,100 square metres is one of the largest in the country, providing space for temporary exhibitions. The gallery can be assessed through the existing Western Range building where a new entrance to the Blavatnik Hall and the museum has been created, and visitors can descend into the gallery via stairs with lacquered tulipwood balustrades.

== Collections ==
The collecting areas of the museum are not easy to summarize, having evolved partly through attempts to avoid too much overlap with other national museums in London. Generally, the classical world of the West and the Ancient Near East is left to the British Museum, and Western paintings to the National Gallery, though there are all sorts of exceptionsfor example, painted portrait miniatures, where the V&amp;A has the main national collection.

The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum is split into four curatorial departments: Decorative Art and Sculpture; Performance, Furniture, Textiles and Fashion; Art, Architecture, Photography and Design; and Asia. The museum curators care for the objects in the collection and provide access to objects that are not currently on display to the public and scholars.

The collection departments are further divided into sixteen display areas, whose combined collection numbers over 6.5  million objects, not all objects are displayed or stored at the V&amp;A. There is a repository at Blythe House, West Kensington, as well as annex institutions managed by the V&amp;A, also the museum lends exhibits to other institutions. The following lists each of the collections on display and the number of objects within the collection.

The museum has 145 galleries, but given the vast extent of the collections, only a small percentage is ever on display. Many acquisitions have been made possible only with the assistance of the National Art Collections Fund.

===Architecture===
In 2004, the V&amp;A alongside Royal Institute of British Architects opened the first permanent gallery in the UK covering the history of architecture with displays using models, photographs, elements from buildings and original drawings. With the opening of the new gallery, the RIBA Drawings and Archives Collection has been transferred to the museum, joining the already extensive collection held by the V&amp;A. With over 600,000 drawings, over 750,000 papers and paraphernalia, and over 700,000 photographs from around the world, together they form the world&#x27;s most comprehensive architectural resource.

Not only are all the major British architects of the last four hundred years represented, but many European (especially Italian) and American architects&#x27; drawings are held in the collection. The RIBA&#x27;s holdings of over 330 drawings by Andrea Palladio are the largest in the world; other Europeans well represented are Jacques Gentilhatre and Antonio Visentini. British architects whose drawings, and in some cases models of their buildings, in the collection, include: Inigo Jones, Sir Christopher Wren, Sir John Vanbrugh, Nicholas Hawksmoor, William Kent, James Gibbs, Robert Adam, Sir William Chambers, James Wyatt, Henry Holland, John Nash, Sir John Soane, Sir Charles Barry, Charles Robert Cockerell, Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, Sir George Gilbert Scott, John Loughborough Pearson, George Edmund Street, Richard Norman Shaw, Alfred Waterhouse, Sir Edwin Lutyens, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Charles Holden, Frank Hoar, Lord Richard Rogers, Lord Norman Foster, Sir Nicholas Grimshaw, Zaha Hadid and Alick Horsnell.

As well as period rooms, the collection includes parts of buildings, for example, the two top stories of the facade of Sir Paul Pindar&#x27;s house dated 1600 from Bishopsgate with elaborately carved woodwork and leaded windows, a rare survivor of the Great Fire of London, there is a brick portal from a London house of the English Restoration period and a fireplace from the gallery of Northumberland house. European examples include a dormer window dated 1523–1535 from the chateau of Montal. There are several examples from Italian Renaissance buildings including, portals, fireplaces, balconies and a stone buffet that used to have a built-in fountain. The main architecture gallery has a series of pillars from various buildings and different periods, for example, a column from the Alhambra. Examples covering Asia are in those galleries concerned with those countries, as well as models and photographs in the main architecture gallery.

In June 2022, the RIBA announced it would be terminating its 20-year partnership with the V&amp;A in 2027, &quot;by mutual agreement&quot;, ending the permanent architecture gallery at the museum. Artefacts will be transferred back to the RIBA&#x27;s existing collections, with some rehoused at the institute&#x27;s headquarters at 66 Portland Place building, set to become a new House of Architecture following a £20 million refurbishment.

=== Asia ===

The V&amp;A&#x27;s collection of Art from Asia numbers more than 160,000 objects, one of the largest in existence. It has one of the world&#x27;s most comprehensive and important collections of Chinese art whilst the collection of South Asian Art is the most important in the West. The museum&#x27;s coverage includes pieces from South and South East Asia, Himalayan kingdoms, China, the Far East and the Islamic world.

==== Islamic art ====
The V&amp;A holds over 19,000 objects from the Islamic world, ranging from the early Islamic period (the 7th century) to the early 20th century. The Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art, opened in 2006, houses a representative display of 400 objects with the highlight being the Ardabil Carpet, the centrepiece of the gallery. The displays in this gallery cover objects from Spain, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and Afghanistan. A masterpiece of Islamic art is a 10th-century Rock crystal ewer.

The museum&#x27;s collections of South and South-East Asian art are the most comprehensive and important in the West comprising nearly 60,000 objects, including about 10,000 textiles and 6,000 paintings, the range of the collection is immense. The Jawaharlal Nehru gallery of Indian art, opened in 1991, contains art from about 500 BC to the 19th century. There is an extensive collection of sculptures, mainly of a religious nature, Hindu, Buddhist and Jain. The gallery is richly endowed with the art of the Mughal Empire and the Maratha Empire, including fine portraits of the emperors and other paintings and drawings, jade wine cups and gold spoons inset with emeralds, diamonds and rubies, also from this period are parts of buildings such as a jaali and pillars.

Refined Hindu and Buddhist sculptures reflect the influence of India; items on the show include betel-nut cutters, ivory combs and bronze palanquin hooks.

===Books===
The museum houses the National Art Library, a public library containing over 750,000 books, photographs, drawings, paintings, and prints. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest libraries dedicated to the study of fine and decorative arts. The library covers all areas and periods of the museum&#x27;s collections with special collections covering illuminated manuscripts, rare books and artists&#x27; letters and archives.

The library consists of three large public rooms, with around a hundred individual study desks. These are the West Room, Centre Room and Reading Room. The centre room contains &#x27;special collection material&#x27;.
One of the great treasures in the library is the Codex Forster, one of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s note books. The Codex consists of three parchment-bound manuscripts, Forster I, Forster II, and Forster III, quite small in size, dated between 1490 and 1505. Their contents include a large collection of sketches and references to the equestrian sculpture commissioned by the Duke of Milan Ludovico Sforza to commemorate his father Francesco Sforza. These were bequeathed with over 18,000 books to the museum in 1876 by John Forster. The Reverend Alexander Dyce was another benefactor of the library, leaving over 14,000 books to the museum in 1869. Amongst the books he collected are early editions in Greek and Latin of the poets and playwrights Aeschylus, Aristotle, Homer, Livy, Ovid, Pindar, Sophocles and Virgil. More recent authors include Giovanni Boccaccio, Dante, Racine, Rabelais and Molière.

Writers whose papers are in the library are as diverse as Charles Dickens (that includes the manuscripts of most of his novels) and Beatrix Potter (with the greatest collection of her original manuscripts in the world). Illuminated manuscripts in the library dating from the 12th to 16th centuries include: a leaf from the Eadwine Psalter, Canterbury; Pocket Book of Hours, Reims; Missal from the Royal Abbey of Saint Denis, Paris; the Simon Marmion Book of Hours, Bruges; 1524 Charter illuminated by Lucas Horenbout, London; the Armagnac manuscript of the trial and rehabilitation of Joan of Arc, Rouen. also the Victorian period is represented by William Morris.

The National Art Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum collection catalogue used to be kept in different formats including printed exhibit catalogues, and card catalogues. A computer system called MODES cataloguing system was used from the 1980s to the 1990s, but those electronic files were not available to the library users. All of the archival material at the National Art Library is using Encoded Archival Description (EAD). The Victoria and Albert Museum has a computer system but most of the items in the collection, unless those were newly accessioned into the collection, probably do not show up in the computer system. There is a feature on the Victoria and Albert Museum website called &quot;Search the Collections,&quot; but not everything is listed there.

The National Art Library also includes a collection of comics and comic art. Notable parts of the collection include the Krazy Kat Arkive, comprising 4,200 comics, and the Rakoff Collection, comprising 17,000 pieces collected by the writer and editor Ian Rakoff.

The Victoria and Albert Museum&#x27;s Word and Image Department was under the same pressure being felt in archives around the world, to digitise their collection. A large scale digitisation project began in 2007 in that department. That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol and to create a factory to completely digitise the collection. The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs using digital cameras. The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. 15,000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. The second step of the Factory Project is to catalogue everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. All of those items which were photographed and catalogued, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project. The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. There is a &quot;Search the Collections&quot; feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. The main impetus behind the large-scale digitisation project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.
===British galleries===
These fifteen galleries—which opened in November 2001—contain around 4,000 objects. The displays in these galleries are based around three major themes: &quot;Style&quot;, &quot;Who Led Taste&quot; and &quot;What Was New&quot;. The period covered is 1500 to 1900, with the galleries divided into three major subdivisions:

* Tudor and Stuart Britain, 1500–1714, covering the Renaissance, Elizabethan, Jacobean, Restoration and Baroque styles
* Georgian Britain, 1714–1837, covering Palladianism, Rococo, Chinoiserie, Neoclassicism, the Regency, the influence of Chinese, Indian and Egyptian styles, and the early Gothic Revival
* Victorian Britain, 1837–1901, covering the later phases of the Gothic Revival, French influences, Classical and Renaissance revivals, Aestheticism, Japanese style, the continuing influence of China, India, and the Islamic world, the Arts and Crafts movement and the Scottish School.

Not only the work of British artists and craftspeople is on display, but also work produced by European artists that was purchased or commissioned by British patrons, as well as imports from Asia, including porcelain, cloth and wallpaper. Designers and artists whose work is on display in the galleries include Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Grinling Gibbons, Daniel Marot, Louis Laguerre, Antonio Verrio, Sir James Thornhill, William Kent, Robert Adam, Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton, Canova, Thomas Chippendale, Pugin, William Morris. Patrons who have influenced taste are also represented by works of art from their collections, these include: Horace Walpole (a major influence on the Gothic Revival), William Thomas Beckford and Thomas Hope.

The galleries showcase a number of complete and partial reconstructions of period rooms, from demolished buildings, including:

* The parlour from 2 Henrietta Street, London, dated 1727–1728, designed by James Gibbs
* The Norfolk House Music Room, St James Square, London, dated 1756, designed by Matthew Brettingham and Giovanni Battista Borra
* A section of a wall from the Glass Drawing-Room of Northumberland House, dated 1773–1775, designed by Robert Adam

Some of the more notable works displayed in the galleries include:
* Pietro Torrigiani&#x27;s coloured terracotta bust of Henry VII, dated 1509–1511
* Henry VIII&#x27;s writing desk, dated 1525, made from walnut and oak, lined with leather and painted and gilded with the king&#x27;s coat of arms
* A spinet dated 1570–1580, made for Elizabeth I
* The Great Bed of Ware, dated 1590–1600, a large, elaborately carved four-poster bed with marquetry headboard
* Gianlorenzo Bernini&#x27;s bust of Thomas Baker, from the 1630s
* 17th-century tapestries from the Sheldon and Mortlake Tapestry Works
* The wood relief of The Stoning of St Stephen, dated , by Grinling Gibbons
* The Macclesfield Wine Set, dated 1719–1720, made by Anthony Nelme, the only complete set known to survive.
* The life-size sculpture of George Frederick Handel, dated 1738, by Louis-François Roubiliac
* Furniture by Thomas Chippendale and Robert Adam
*The sculpture of Bashaw, dated 1831–1834, by Matthew Cotes Wyatt
* Aesthetic and Arts &amp; Crafts furniture by Edward William Godwin and Charles Rennie Mackintosh; and carpets and interior textiles by William Morris.

The galleries also link design to wider trends in British culture. For instance, design in the Tudor period was influenced by the spread of printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain. In the Stuart period, increasing trade, especially with Asia, enabled wider access to luxuries like carpets, lacquered furniture, silks and porcelain. In the Georgian age there was an increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure. For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies. European styles are seen on the Grand Tour also influenced taste. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the growth of mass production produced entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade. In the Victorian era new technology and machinery had a significant effect on manufacturing, and for the first time since the reformation, the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches had a major effect on art and design such as the Gothic Revival. There is a large display on the Great Exhibition which, among other things, led to the founding of the V&amp;A. In the later 19th century, the increasing backlash against industrialisation, led by John Ruskin, contributed to the Arts and Crafts movement.

===Cast courts===

One of the most dramatic parts of the museum is the Cast Courts, comprising two large, skylighted rooms two storeys high housing hundreds of plaster casts of sculptures, friezes and tombs. One of these is dominated by a full-scale replica of Trajan&#x27;s Column, cut in half to fit under the ceiling. The other includes reproductions of various works of Italian Renaissance sculpture and architecture, including a full-size replica of Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;. Replicas of two earlier Davids by Donatello and Verrocchio, are also included, although for conservation reasons the Verrocchio replica is displayed in a glass case.

The two courts are divided by corridors on both storeys, and the partitions that used to line the upper corridor (the Gilbert Bayes sculpture gallery) were removed in 2004 to allow the courts to be viewed from above.

===Ceramics and glass===

This is the largest and most comprehensive ceramics and glass collection in the world, with over 80,000 objects from around the world. Every populated continent is represented. Apart from the many pieces in the Primary Galleries on the ground floor, much of the top floor is devoted to galleries of ceramics of all periods covered, which include display cases with a representative selection, but also massed &quot;visible storage&quot; displays of the reserve collection.

Well represented in the collection is Meissen porcelain, from the first factory in Europe to discover the Chinese method of making porcelain. Among the finest examples are the Meissen Vulture from 1731 and the Möllendorff Dinner Service, designed in 1762 by Frederick II the Great. Ceramics from the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres are extensive, especially from the 18th and 19th centuries. The collection of 18th-century British porcelain is the largest and finest in the world. Examples from every factory are represented, the collections of Chelsea porcelain and Worcester porcelain being especially fine. All the major 19th-century British factories are also represented. A major boost to the collections was the Salting Bequest made in 1909, which enriched the museum&#x27;s stock of Chinese and Japanese ceramics. This bequest forms part of the finest collection of East Asian pottery and porcelain in the world, including Kakiemon ware.
Many famous potters, such as Josiah Wedgwood, William De Morgan and Bernard Leach as well as Mintons &amp; Royal Doulton are represented in the collection. There is an extensive collection of Delftware produced in both Britain and Holland, which includes a circa 1695 flower pyramid over a metre in height. Bernard Palissy has several examples of his work in the collection including dishes, jugs and candlesticks. The largest objects in the collection are a series of elaborately ornamented ceramic stoves from the 16th and 17th centuries, made in Germany and Switzerland. There is an unrivalled collection of Italian maiolica and lustreware from Spain. The collection of Iznik pottery from Turkey is the largest in the world.

The glass collection covers 4000 years of glassmaking, and has over 6000 pieces from Africa, Britain, Europe, America and Asia. The earliest glassware on display comes from Ancient Egypt and continues through the Ancient Roman, Medieval, Renaissance covering areas such as Venetian glass and Bohemian glass and more recent periods, including Art Nouveau glass by Louis Comfort Tiffany and Émile Gallé, the Art Deco style is represented by several examples by René Lalique. There are many examples of crystal chandeliers, both English, displayed in the British galleries, and foreign – for example, a Venetian one attributed to Giuseppe Briati and dated to about 1750. The stained glass collection is possibly the finest in the world, covering the medieval to modern periods, and covering Europe as well as Britain. Several examples of English 16th-century heraldic glass is displayed in the British Galleries. Many well-known designers of stained glass are represented in the collection including, from the 19th century: Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. There is also an example of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s work in the collection. Notable designers of the 20th-century represented include Harry Clarke, John Piper, Patrick Reyntiens, Veronica Whall and Brian Clarke.

The main gallery was redesigned in 1994, the glass balustrade on the staircase and mezzanine are the work of Danny Lane, the gallery covering contemporary glass opened in 2004 and the sacred silver and stained-glass gallery in 2005. In this latter gallery stained glass is displayed alongside silverware starting in the 12th century and continuing to the present. Some of the most outstanding stained glass, dated 1243–1248 comes from the Sainte-Chapelle, is displayed along with other examples in the new Medieval &amp; Renaissance galleries. The important 13th-century glass beaker known as the Luck of Edenhall is also displayed in these galleries. Examples of British stained glass are displayed in the British Galleries. One of the most spectacular works in the collection is the chandelier by Dale Chihuly in the rotunda at the museum&#x27;s main entrance.

===Contemporary===
These galleries are dedicated to temporary exhibits showcasing both trends from recent decades and the latest in design and fashion.

===Prints and drawings===
Prints and drawings from the over 750,000 works in the collection can be seen on request at the print room, the &quot;Prints and Drawings study Room&quot;; booking an appointment is necessary. The collection of drawings includes over 10,000 British and 2,000 old master works, including works by: Dürer, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, Bernardo Buontalenti, Rembrandt, Antonio Verrio, Paul Sandby, John Russell, Angelica Kauffman, John Flaxman, Hugh Douglas Hamilton, Thomas Rowlandson, William Kilburn, Thomas Girtin, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, David Wilkie, John Martin, Samuel Palmer, Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, Lord Leighton, Sir Samuel Luke Fildes and Aubrey Beardsley. Modern British artists represented in the collection include: Paul Nash, Percy Wyndham Lewis, Eric Gill, Stanley Spencer, John Piper, Robert Priseman, Graham Sutherland, Lucian Freud and David Hockney.

The print collection has more than 500,000 objects, covering: posters, greetings cards, bookplates, as well as a comprehensive collection of old master prints from the Renaissance to the present, including works by Rembrandt, William Hogarth, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Canaletto, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Henri Matisse and Sir William Nicholson.

===Fashion===
The costume collection is the most comprehensive in Britain, containing over 14,000 outfits plus accessories, mainly dating from 1600 to the present. Costume sketches, design notebooks, and other works on paper are typically held by the Word and Image department. Because everyday clothing from previous eras has not generally survived, the collection is dominated by fashionable clothes made for special occasions. One of the first significant gifts of the costume came in 1913 when the V&amp;A received the Talbot Hughes collection containing 1,442 costumes and items as a gift from Harrods following its display at the nearby department store.

Some of the oldest works in the collection are medieval vestments, especially Opus Anglicanum. One of the most important pieces in the collection is the wedding suit of James II of England, which is displayed in the British Galleries.

In 1971, Cecil Beaton curated an exhibition of 1,200 20th-century high-fashion garments and accessories, including gowns worn by leading socialites such as Patricia Lopez-Willshaw, Gloria Guinness and Lee Radziwill, and actresses such as Audrey Hepburn and Ruth Ford. After the exhibition, Beaton donated most of the exhibits to the museum in the names of their former owners.

In 1999, V&amp;A began a series of live catwalk events at the museum titled &quot;Fashion in Motion&quot; featuring pieces from historically significant fashion collections. The first show featured Alexander McQueen in June 1999. Since then, the museum has hosted recreations of various designer shows every year including Anna Sui, Tristan Webber, Elspeth Gibson, Chunghie Lee, Jean Paul Gaultier, Missoni, Gianfranco Ferré, Christian Lacroix, Kenzo and Kansai Yamamoto amongst others.

In 2002, the museum acquired the Costiff collection of 178 Vivienne Westwood costumes. Other famous designers with work in the collection include Coco Chanel, Hubert de Givenchy, Christian Dior, Cristóbal Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent, Guy Laroche, Irene Galitzine, Mila Schön, Valentino Garavani, Norman Norell, Norman Hartnell, Zandra Rhodes, Hardy Amies, Mary Quant, Christian Lacroix, Jean Muir and Pierre Cardin. The museum continues to acquire examples of modern fashion to add to the collection.

The V&amp;A runs an ongoing textile and dress conservation programme. For example, in 2008, an important but heavily soiled, distorted and water-damaged 1954 Dior outfit called &#x27;Zemire&#x27; was restored to displayable condition for the &quot;Golden Age of Couture&quot; exhibition.
The museum has a large collection of shoes; around 2000 pairs from different cultures around the world. The collection shows the chronological progression of shoe height, heel shape and materials, revealing just how many styles we consider to be modern have been in and out of fashion across the centuries.

===Furniture===
In November 2012, the museum opened its first gallery to be exclusively dedicated to furniture. Prior to this date furniture had been exhibited as part of a greater period context, rather than in isolation to showcase its design and construction merits. Among the designers showcased in the new gallery are Ron Arad, John Henry Belter, Joe Colombo, Eileen Gray, Verner Panton, Thonet, and Frank Lloyd Wright.

The furniture collection, while covering Europe and America from the Middle Ages to the present, is predominantly British, dating between 1700 and 1900. Many of the finest examples are displayed in the British Galleries, including pieces by Chippendale, Adam, Morris, and Mackintosh. One of the oldest objects is a chair leg from Middle Egypt dated to 200-395AD.

The Furniture and Woodwork collection also includes complete rooms, musical instruments, and clocks. Among the rooms owned by the museum are the Boudoir of Madame de Sévilly (Paris, 1781–82) by Claude Nicolas Ledoux, with painted panelling by Jean Simeon Rousseau de la Rottière; and Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Kaufmann Office, designed and constructed between 1934 and 1937 for the owner of a Pittsburgh department store.

The collection includes pieces by William Kent, Henry Flitcroft, Matthias Lock, James Stuart, William Chambers, John Gillow, James Wyatt, Thomas Hopper, Charles Heathcote Tatham, Pugin, William Burges, Charles Voysey, Charles Robert Ashbee, Baillie Scott, Edwin Lutyens, Edward Maufe, Wells Coates and Robin Day. The museum also hosts the national collection of wallpaper, which is looked after by the Prints, Drawings and Paintings department.

The Soulages collection of Italian and French Renaissance objects was acquired between 1859 and 1865, and includes several cassone. The John Jones Collection of French 18th-century art and furnishings was left to the museum in 1882, then valued at £250,000. One of the most important pieces in this collection is a marquetry commode by the &quot;ébéniste&quot; Jean Henri Riesener dated c1780. Other signed pieces of furniture in the collection include a bureau by Jean-François Oeben, a pair of pedestals with inlaid brass work by André Charles Boulle, a commode by Bernard Vanrisamburgh and a work-table by Martin Carlin. Other 18th-century ébénistes represented in the museum collection include Adam Weisweiler, David Roentgen, Gilles Joubert and Pierre Langlois. In 1901, Sir George Donaldson donated several pieces of art Nouveau furniture to the museum, which he had acquired the previous year at the Paris Exposition Universelle. This was criticised at the time, with the result that the museum ceased to collect contemporary pieces and did not do so again until the 1960s. In 1986 the Lady Abingdon collection of French Empire furniture was bequeathed by Mrs T. R. P. Hole.

There are a set of beautiful inlaid doors, dated 1580 from Antwerp City Hall, attributed to Hans Vredeman de Vries. One of the finest pieces of continental furniture in the collection is the Rococo Augustus Rex Bureau Cabinet dated c1750 from Germany, with especially fine marquetry and ormolu mounts. One of the grandest pieces of 19th-century furniture is the highly elaborate French Cabinet dated 1861–1867 made by M. Fourdinois, made from ebony inlaid with box, lime, holly, pear, walnut and mahogany woods as well as marble with gilded carvings. Furniture designed by Ernest Gimson, Edward William Godwin, Charles Voysey, Adolf Loos and Otto Wagner are among the late 19th-century and early 20th-century examples in the collection. The work of modernists in the collection include Le Corbusier, Marcel Breuer, Charles and Ray Eames, and Giò Ponti.

One of the oldest clocks in the collection is an astronomical clock of 1588 by Francis Nowe. One of the largest is James Markwick the younger&#x27;s longcase clock of 1725, nearly 3 metres in height and japanned. Other clockmakers with work in the collection include: Thomas Tompion, Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy, John Ellicott and William Carpenter.

===Jewellery===

The museum&#x27;s jewellery collection, containing over 6000 pieces is one of the finest and most comprehensive collections of jewellery in the world and includes works dating from Ancient Egypt to the present day, as well as jewellery designs on paper. The museum owns pieces by renowned jewellers Cartier, Jean Schlumberger, Peter Carl Fabergé, Andrew Grima, Hemmerle and Lalique. Other items in the collection include diamond dress ornaments made for Catherine the Great, bracelet clasps once belonging to Marie Antoinette, and the Beauharnais emerald necklace presented by Napoleon to his adopted daughter Hortense de Beauharnais in 1806. The museum also collects international modern jewellery by designers such as Gijs Bakker, Onno Boekhoudt, Peter Chang, Gerda Flockinger, Lucy Sarneel, Dorothea Prühl and Wendy Ramshaw, and African and Asian traditional jewellery. Major bequests include Reverend Chauncy Hare Townshend&#x27;s collection of 154 gems bequeathed in 1869, Lady Cory&#x27;s 1951 gift of major diamond jewellery from the 18th and 19th centuries, and jewellery scholar Dame Joan Evans&#x27; 1977 gift of more than 800 jewels dating from the Middle Ages to the early 19th century. A new jewellery gallery, funded by William and Judith Bollinger, opened on 24 May 2008.

=== Metalwork ===
This collection of more than 45,000 objects covers decorative ironwork, both wrought and cast, bronze, silverware, arms and armour, pewter, brassware and enamels (including many examples Limoges enamel). The main iron work gallery was redesigned in 1995.

There are over 10,000 objects made from silver or gold in the collection, the display (about 15 percent of the collection) is divided into secular and sacred covering both Christian (Roman Catholic, Anglican and Greek Orthodox) and Jewish liturgical vessels and other works. The main silver gallery is divided into these areas: British silver pre-1800; British silver 1800 to 1900; modernist to contemporary silver; European silver. The collection includes the earliest known piece of English silver with a dated hallmark, a silver gilt beaker dated 1496–1497.

Silversmiths whose work is represented in the collection include Paul Storr (whose Castlereagh Inkstand, dated 1817–1819, is one of his finest works) and Paul de Lamerie.

The main iron work gallery covers European wrought and cast iron from the medieval period to the early 20th century. The master of wrought ironwork Jean Tijou is represented by both examples of his work and designs on paper. One of the largest objects is the Hereford Screen, weighing nearly 8 tonnes, 10.5 metres high and 11 metres wide, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1862 for the chancel in Hereford Cathedral, from which it was removed in 1967. It was made by Skidmore &amp; Company. Its structure of timber and cast iron is embellished with wrought iron, burnished brass and copper. Much of the copper and ironwork is painted in a wide range of colours. The arches and columns are decorated with polished quartz and panels of mosaic.

One of the rarest works in the collection is the 58 cm-high Gloucester Candlestick, dated to c1110, made from gilt bronze; with highly elaborate and intricate intertwining branches containing small figures and inscriptions, it is a tour de force of bronze casting. Also of importance is the Becket Casket dated c1180 to contain relics of St Thomas Becket, made from gilt copper, with enamelled scenes of the saint&#x27;s martyrdom. Another highlight is the 1351 Reichenau Crozier. The Burghley Nef, a salt-cellar, French, dated 1527–1528, uses a nautilus shell to form the hull of a vessel, which rests on the tail of a parcelgilt mermaid, who rests on a hexagonal gilt plinth on six claw-and-ball feet. Both masts have main and top-sails, and battlemented fighting-tops are made from gold. These items are displayed in the new Medieval &amp; Renaissance galleries.

===Musical instruments===
Musical instruments are classified as furniture by the museum, although Asian instruments are held by their relevant departments.

Among the more important instruments owned by the museum are a violin by Antonio Stradivari dated 1699, an oboe that belonged to Gioachino Rossini, and a jewelled spinet dated 1571 made by Annibale Rossi. The collection also includes a 1570 virginal said to have belonged to Elizabeth I, and late 19th-century pianos designed by Edward Burne-Jones, and Baillie Scott.

The Musical Instruments gallery closed on 25 February 2010, a decision that was highly controversial. An online petition of over 5,100 names on the Parliamentary website led to Chris Smith asking in Parliament about the future of the collection. The answer, from Bryan Davies, was that the museum intended to preserve and care for the collection and keep it available to the public, with objects being redistributed to the British Galleries, the Medieval &amp; Renaissance Galleries, and the planned new galleries for Furniture and Europe 1600–1800, and that the Horniman Museum and other institutions were possible candidates for loans of material to ensure that the instruments remained publicly viewable. The Horniman went on to host a joint exhibition with the V&amp;A of musical instruments, and has the loan of 35 instruments from the museum.
===Paintings (and miniatures)===
The collection includes about 1130 British and 650 European oil paintings, 6800 British watercolours, pastels and 2000 miniatures, for which the museum holds the national collection. Also on loan to the museum, from Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth II, are the Raphael Cartoons: the seven surviving (there were ten) full-scale designs for tapestries in the Sistine Chapel, of the lives of Peter and Paul from the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. There is also on display a fresco by Pietro Perugino, dated 1522, from the church of Castello at Fontignano (Perugia) which is amongst the painter&#x27;s last works. One of the largest objects in the collection is the Spanish retable of St George, , 670 x 486 cm, in tempera on wood, consisting of numerous scenes and painted by Andrés Marzal De Sax in Valencia.

19th-century British artists are well represented. John Constable and J. M. W. Turner are represented by oil paintings, watercolours and drawings. One of the most unusual objects on display is Thomas Gainsborough&#x27;s experimental showbox with its back-lit landscapes, which he painted on glass, which allowed them to be changed like slides. Other landscape painters with works on display include Philip James de Loutherbourg, Peter De Wint and John Ward.

In 1857 John Sheepshanks donated 233 paintings, mainly by contemporary British artists, and a similar number of drawings to the museum with the intention of forming a &#x27;A National Gallery of British Art&#x27;, a role since taken on by Tate Britain; artists represented are William Blake, James Barry, Henry Fuseli, Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, Sir David Wilkie, William Mulready, William Powell Frith, Millais and Hippolyte Delaroche. Although some of Constable&#x27;s works came to the museum with the Sheepshanks bequest, the majority of the artist&#x27;s works were donated by his daughter Isabel in 1888, including the large number of sketches in oil, the most significant being the 1821 full size oil sketch for &quot;The Hay Wain&quot;. Other artists with works in the collection include: Bernardino Fungai, Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, Domenico di Pace Beccafumi, Fioravante Ferramola, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Anthony van Dyck, Ludovico Carracci, Antonio Verrio, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Domenico Tiepolo, Canaletto, Francis Hayman, Pompeo Batoni, Benjamin West, Paul Sandby, Richard Wilson, William Etty, Henry Fuseli, Sir Thomas Lawrence, James Barry, Francis Danby, Richard Parkes Bonington and Alphonse Legros.

Richard Ellison&#x27;s collection of 100 British watercolours was given by his widow in 1860 and 1873 &#x27;to promote the foundation of the National Collection of Water-Color Paintings&#x27;. Over 500 British and European oil paintings, watercolours and miniatures and 3000 drawings and prints were bequeathed in 1868–1869 by the clergymen Chauncey Hare Townshend and Alexander Dyce.

Several French paintings entered the collection as part of the 260 paintings and miniatures (not all the works were French, for example Carlo Crivelli&#x27;s &quot;Virgin and Child&quot;) that formed part of the Jones bequest of 1882 and as such are displayed in the galleries of continental art 1600–1800, including the portrait of François, Duc d&#x27;Alençon by François Clouet, Gaspard Dughet and works by François Boucher including his portrait of Madame de Pompadour dated 1758, Jean François de Troy, Jean-Baptiste Pater and their contemporaries.

Another major Victorian benefactor was Constantine Alexander Ionides, who left 82 oil paintings to the museum in 1901, including works by Botticelli, Tintoretto, Adriaen Brouwer, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet, Eugène Delacroix, Théodore Rousseau, Edgar Degas, Jean-François Millet, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, plus watercolours and over a thousand drawings and prints

The Salting Bequest of 1909 included, among other works, watercolours by J. M. W. Turner. Other watercolourists include: William Gilpin, Thomas Rowlandson, William Blake, John Sell Cotman, Paul Sandby, William Mulready, Edward Lear, James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Paul Cézanne.

There is a copy of Raphael&#x27;s &quot;The School of Athens&quot; over 4 metres by 8 metres in size, dated 1755 by Anton Raphael Mengs on display in the eastern Cast Court.

Miniaturists represented in the collection include Jean Bourdichon, Hans Holbein the Younger, Nicholas Hilliard, Isaac Oliver, Peter Oliver, Jean Petitot, Alexander Cooper, Samuel Cooper, Thomas Flatman, Rosalba Carriera, Christian Friedrich Zincke, George Engleheart, John Smart, Richard Cosway and William Charles Ross.

===Photography===
The collection contains more than 500,000 images dating from the advent of photography, the oldest image dating from 1839. The gallery displays a series of changing exhibits and closes between exhibitions to allow full re-display to take place. Already in 1858, when the museum was called the South Kensington Museum, it had the world&#x27;s first international photographic exhibition.

The collection includes the work of many photographers from Fox Talbot, Julia Margaret Cameron, Viscountess Clementina Hawarden, Gustave Le Gray, Benjamin Brecknell Turner, Frederick Hollyer, Samuel Bourne, Roger Fenton, Man Ray, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Ilse Bing, Bill Brandt, Cecil Beaton (there are more than 8000 of his negatives), Don McCullin, David Bailey, Jim Lee and Helen Chadwick to the present day.

One of the more unusual collections is that of Eadweard Muybridge&#x27;s photographs of Animal Locomotion of 1887, this consists of 781 plates. These sequences of photographs taken a fraction of a second apart capture images of different animals and humans performing various actions. There are several of John Thomson&#x27;s 1876-7 images of Street Life in London in the collection. The museum also holds James Lafayette&#x27;s society portraits, a collection of more than 600 photographs dating from the late 19th to early 20th centuries and portraying a wide range of society figures of the period, including bishops, generals, society ladies, Indian maharajas, Ethiopian rulers and other foreign leaders, actresses, people posing in their motor cars and a sequence of photographs recording the guests at the famous fancy-dress ball held at Devonshire House in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s diamond jubilee.

In 2003 and 2007 Penelope Smail and Kathleen Moffat generously donated Curtis Moffat&#x27;s extensive archive to the museum. He created dynamic abstract photographs, innovative colour still-lives and glamorous society portraits during the 1920s and 1930s. He was also a pivotal figure in Modernist interior design. In Paris during the 1920s, Moffat collaborated with Man Ray, producing portraits and abstract photograms or &quot;rayographs&quot;.

===Sculpture===

The sculpture collection at the V&amp;A is the most comprehensive holding of post-classical European sculpture in the world. There are approximately 22,000 objects in the collection that cover the period from about 400 AD to 1914. This covers among other periods Byzantine and Anglo Saxon ivory sculptures, British, French and Spanish medieval statues and carvings, the Renaissance, Baroque, Neo-Classical, Victorian and Art Nouveau periods. All uses of sculpture are represented, from tomb and memorial, to portrait, allegorical, religious, mythical, statues for gardens including fountains, as well as architectural decorations. Materials used include, marble, alabaster, stone, terracotta, wood (history of wood carving), ivory, gesso, plaster, bronze, lead and ceramics.

The collection of Italian, Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical sculpture (both original and in cast form) is unequalled outside of Italy. It includes Canova&#x27;s &quot;The Three Graces&quot;, which the museum jointly owns with National Galleries of Scotland. Italian sculptors whose work is held by the museum include: Bartolomeo Bon, Bartolomeo Bellano, Luca della Robbia, Giovanni Pisano, Donatello, Agostino di Duccio, Andrea Riccio, Antonio Rossellino, Andrea del Verrocchio, Antonio Lombardo, Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi, Andrea della Robbia, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo, Michelangelo (represented by a freehand wax model and casts of his most famous sculptures), Jacopo Sansovino, Alessandro Algardi, Antonio Calcagni, Benvenuto Cellini (Medusa&#x27;s head dated ), Agostino Busti, Bartolomeo Ammannati, Giacomo della Porta, Giambologna (Samson Slaying a Philistine , his finest work outside Italy), Bernini (Neptune and Triton ), Giovanni Battista Foggini, Vincenzo Foggini (Samson and the Philistines), Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, Antonio Corradini, Andrea Brustolon, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Innocenzo Spinazzi, Canova, Carlo Marochetti and Raffaelle Monti. 

An unusual sculpture is the ancient Roman statue of Narcissus restored by Valerio Cioli with plaster. There are several small scale bronzes by Donatello such as &quot;The Ascension with Christ giving the Keys to St Peter&quot; and &quot;Lamentation of Christ&quot;, Alessandro Vittoria, Tiziano Aspetti and Francesco Fanelli in the collection. The largest work from Italy is the Chancel Chapel from Santa Chiara Florence dated 1493–1500, designed by Giuliano da Sangallo it is 11.1 metres in height by 5.4 metres square, it includes a grand sculpted tabernacle by Antonio Rossellino and coloured terracotta decoration.

Rodin is represented by more than 20 works in the museum collection, making it one of the largest collections of the sculptor&#x27;s work outside France; these were given to the museum by the sculptor in 1914, as acknowledgement of Britain&#x27;s support of France in the First World War, although the statue of St John the Baptist had been purchased in 1902 by public subscription. Other French sculptors with work in the collection are Hubert Le Sueur, François Girardon, Michel Clodion, Jean-Antoine Houdon, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and Jules Dalou.

There are also several Renaissance works by Northern European sculptors in the collection including work by: Veit Stoss, Tilman Riemenschneider, Hendrick de Keyser, Hans Daucher and Peter Flötner. Baroque works from the same area include the work of Adriaen de Vries and Sébastien Slodtz. The Spanish sculptors with work in the collection include Alonso Berruguete and Luisa Roldán represented by her &quot;Virgin and Child with St Diego of Alcala&quot; .

Sculptors, both British and European, who were based in Britain and whose work is in the collection include Nicholas Stone, Caius Gabriel Cibber, Grinling Gibbons, John Michael Rysbrack, Louis-François Roubiliac, Peter Scheemakers, Sir Henry Cheere, Agostino Carlini, Thomas Banks, Joseph Nollekens, Joseph Wilton, John Flaxman, Sir Francis Chantrey, John Gibson, Edward Hodges Baily, Lord Leighton, Alfred Stevens, Thomas Brock, Alfred Gilbert, George Frampton, and Eric Gill. A sample of some of these sculptors&#x27; work is on display in the British Galleries.

With the opening of the Dorothy and Michael Hintze sculpture galleries in 2006 it was decided to extend the chronology of the works on display up to 1950; this has involved loans by other museums, including Tate Britain, so works by Henry Moore and Jacob Epstein along with other of their contemporaries are now on view. These galleries concentrate on works dated between 1600 and 1950 by British sculptors, works by continental sculptors who worked in Britain, and works bought by British patrons from the continental sculptors, such as Canova&#x27;s &quot;Theseus and the Minotaur&quot;. The galleries overlooking the garden are arranged by theme, tomb sculpture, portraiture, garden sculpture and mythology. There is also a section that covers late 19th-century and early 20th-century sculpture, which includes work by Rodin and other French sculptors such as Dalou who spent several years in Britain where he taught sculpture.

Smaller-scale works are displayed in the Gilbert Bayes gallery, covering medieval especially English alabaster sculpture, bronzes, wooden sculptures and has demonstrations of various techniques such as bronze casting using lost-wax casting.

The majority of the Medieval and Renaissance sculpture is displayed in the new Medieval and Renaissance galleries (opened December 2009).

One of the largest objects in the collection is the rood loft from St. John&#x27;s Cathedral (&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch), from the Netherlands, dated 1610–1613 this is as much a work of architecture as sculpture, 10.4 metres wide, 7.8 metres high, the architectural framework is of various coloured marbles including columns, arches and balustrade, against which are statues and bas-reliefs and other carvings in alabaster, the work of sculptor Conrad van Norenberch.

===Textiles===
The collection of textiles consists of more than 53,000 examples, mainly western European though all populated continents are represented, dating from the 1st century AD to the present, this is the largest such collection in the world. Techniques represented include weaving, printing, quilting embroidery, lace, tapestry and carpets. These are classified by technique, countries of origin and date of production. The collections are well represented in these areas: early silks from the Near East, lace, European tapestries and English medieval church embroidery.

The tapestry collection includes a fragment of the Cloth of St Gereon, the oldest known surviving European tapestry. A highlight of the collection is the four Devonshire Hunting Tapestries, very rare 15th-century tapestries, woven in the Netherlands, depicting the hunting of various animals; not just their age but their size make these unique. Both of the major English centres of tapestry weaving of the 16th and 17th centuries respectively, Sheldon &amp; Mortlake are represented in the collection by several examples. Also included are tapestries from John Vanderbank&#x27;s workshop which was the leading English tapestry manufactory in the late 17th century and early 18th century. Some of the finest tapestries are examples from the Gobelins workshop, including a set of &#x27;Jason and the Argonauts&#x27; dating from the 1750s. Other continental centres of tapestry weaving with work in the collection include Brussels, Tournai, Beauvais, Strasbourg and Florence.

One of the earliest surviving examples of European quilting, the late 14th-century Sicilian Tristan Quilt, is also held by the collection. The collection has numerous examples of various types of textiles designed by William Morris, including, embroidery, woven fabrics, tapestries (including &quot;The Forest&quot; tapestry of 1887), rugs and carpets, as well as pattern books and paper designs. The art deco period is covered by rugs and fabrics designed by Marion Dorn. From the same period there is a rug designed by Serge Chermayeff.

The collection also includes the Oxburgh Hangings, which were made by Mary, Queen of Scots and Bess of Hardwick. However, the Oxburgh Hangings are on permanent long-term loan at Oxburgh Hall.

===Theatre and performance===
The V&amp;A holds the national collection of performing arts in the UK, including drama, dance, opera, circus, puppetry, comedy, musical theatre, costume, set design, pantomime, popular music and other forms of live entertainment.
The Theatre &amp; Performance collections were founded in the 1920s when private collector, Gabrielle Enthoven, donated her collection of theatrical memorabilia to the V&amp;A. In 1974 two further independent collections were compiled to form a comprehensive performing arts collection at the V&amp;A. The collections were displayed at the Theatre Museum, which operated from Covent Garden until closing in 2007. Theatre &amp; Performance galleries opened at South Kensington in March 2009 tracing the production process of performance and include a temporary exhibition space. Types of objects displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.

The department holds significant archives documenting current practice and the history of performing arts. These include the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre, D&#x27;Oyly Carte and the design collection of the Arts Council. Notable personal archives include Vivien Leigh, Peter Brook, Henry Irving and Ivor Novello.

Rock and pop are well represented with the Glastonbury Festival archive, Harry Hammond photographic collection and Jamie Reid archive documenting punk. Costumes include those worn by John Lennon, Mick Jagger, Elton John, Adam Ant, Chris Martin, Iggy Pop, Prince, Shirley Bassey and the stage outfit worn by Roger Daltrey at Woodstock.

In 2024, the museum displayed costumes worn by Taylor Swift over the course of her career. The exhibition, titled &quot;Taylor Swift Songbook Trail,&quot; was conceived by theatre designer Tom Piper as an &quot;approximately 1 mile long&quot; [...] &quot;journey through V&amp;A South Kensington&#x27;s galleries&quot; with &quot;13 stops&quot;. Most of the displays were dispersed throughout the museum, and the &quot;rarely-seen Prince Consort Gallery&quot; was entirely devoted to the exhibition.

==Departments==

===Education===
The education department has wide-ranging responsibilities. It provides information for the casual visitor as well as for school groups, including integrating learning in the museum with the National Curriculum; it provides research facilities for students at degree level and beyond, with information and access to the collections. It also oversees the content of the museum&#x27;s website in addition to publishing books and papers on the collections, research and other aspects of the museum.

Several areas of the collection have dedicated study rooms, these allow access to objects in the collection that are not currently on display, but in some cases require an appointment to be made.

The new Sackler education suite, occupying the two lower floors of the Henry Cole Wing opened in September 2008. This includes lecture rooms and areas for use by schools, which will be available during school holidays for use by families, and will enable direct handling of items from the collection.

==== V&amp;A Publishing ====
V&amp;A Publishing, within the education department, works to raise funds for the museum by publishing around 30 books and digital items each year. The company has around 180 books in print.

==== Activities for children ====
Activity backpacks are available for children. These are free to borrow and include hands-on activities such as puzzles, construction games and stories related to themes of the museum.

==== Activities for adults ====
The Learning Academy offers adult courses as well as training for professionals in the culture and heritage sector, both nationally and internationally. We also have great facilities in which to teach, study and get closer to our collections.

=== Research and conservation ===
Research is a very important area of the museum&#x27;s work, and includes: identification and interpretation of individual objects; other studies contribute to systematic research, this develops the public understanding of the art and artefacts of many of the great cultures of the world; visitor research and evaluation to discover the needs of visitors and their experiences of the museum. Since 1990, the museum has published research reports; these focus on all areas of the collections.

Conservation is responsible for the long-term preservation of the collections, and covers all the collections held by the V&amp;A and the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood. The conservators specialise in particular areas of conservation. Areas covered by the conservator&#x27;s work include &quot;preventive&quot; conservation this includes: performing surveys, assessments and providing advice on the handling of items, correct packaging, mounting and handling procedures during movement and display to reduce risk of damaging objects. Activities include controlling the museum environment (for example, temperature and light) and preventing pests (primarily insects) from damaging artefacts. The other major category is &quot;interventive&quot; conservation, this includes: cleaning and reintegration to strengthen fragile objects, reveal original surface decoration, and restore shape. Interventive treatment makes an object more stable, but also more attractive and comprehensible to the viewer. It is usually undertaken on items that are to go on public display.

=== National Art Library ===
In the early 2000s the National Art Library merged with the Prints, Paintings and Drawings department to form the Word and Image Department. The library and its reading rooms are located on the second floor of the V&amp;A, though some collections, particularly Archives, are held off-site.

==Partnerships==

The V&amp;A works with a small number of partner organisations in Sheffield, Dundee and Blackpool to provide a regional presence.

The V&amp;A discussed with the University of Dundee, University of Abertay, Dundee City Council and the Scottish Government in 2007 with a view to opening a new £43 million gallery in Dundee, which would use the V&amp;A brand although it would be funded through and operated independently. Costs was estimated at £76 million in 2015, making it the most expensive gallery project ever undertaken in Scotland. V&amp;A Dundee opened on 15 September 2018. Dundee City Council pays for a major part of the running costs. The V&amp;A does not contribute financially, but it provides expertise, loans and exhibitions.

Plans for a new gallery in Blackpool are also under consideration. This follows earlier plans to move the theatre collection to a new £60m museum in Blackpool, which failed due to lack of funding. The V&amp;A exhibits twice a year at the Millennium Galleries in partnership with Museums Sheffield.

The V&amp;A is one of 17 museums across Europe and the Mediterranean participating in a project called &quot;Discover Islamic Art&quot;. Developed by the Brussels-based consortium Museum With No Frontiers, this online &quot;virtual museum&quot; brings together more than 1200 works of Islamic art and architecture into a single database. In 2009, the V&amp;A established an art award, the Jameel Prize, for &quot; contemporary art and design inspired by Islamic tradition&quot; in partnership with Art Jameel.

The V&amp;A is an important hub for the London Design Festival and hosts many festival reflated exhibitions and events.

The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. As with other national British museums, entrance is free.

== Temporary exhibitions ==
The V&amp;A has large galleries devoted to temporary exhibitions. A typical year will see more than a dozen different exhibitions being staged, covering all areas of the collections. Notable exhibitions of recent years have been:

* &quot;Britain Can Make It&quot;, 1946
* &quot;Hats: An Anthology&quot;, 2009
* &quot;Power of Making&quot;, 2011 
* &quot;David Bowie Is&quot;, 2013
* &quot;Food: Bigger Than the Plate&quot;, 2019
* &quot;Concealed Histories: Uncovering the Story of Nazi Looting&quot;, 2019 – 2021

The V&amp;A came second in London&#x27;s top paid exhibitions in 2015 with the record-breaking Alexander McQueen show (3,472 a day).

== Controversies ==
In November 2019 the art photographer Nan Goldin led a &quot;die-in&quot; in the Sackler courtyard entrance of the museum, in protest against the V&amp;A&#x27;s acceptance of donations from the Sackler family, which owned Purdue Pharma, makers of the addictive opioid painkiller OxyContin. The museum&#x27;s director, Tristram Hunt, defended the museum&#x27;s relationship with the Sacklers, saying it was proud to have received support from the family over a number of years.

Also in 2019 the V&amp;A received sponsorship for an exhibition on cars from Bosch, which had been fined 90 million euro over its part in the diesel emissions scandal. A V&amp;A spokeswoman said: &quot;Bosch is at the forefront of innovation, with a focus on delivering sustainable solutions for the mobility of the future.&quot;

Extinction Rebellion staged a dirty protest outside the V&amp;A Dundee, in protest against Barclays Bank&#x27;s sponsorship of the museum&#x27;s Mary Quant exhibition.

In 2021 plans to cut the museum&#x27;s costs by reorganising its collections by date rather than by material were abandoned after critics said it would lead to staff cuts and thereby a loss of expertise.

== Media ==
Starting in March 2020 BBC Two transmitted a series of six programmes depicting the back-stage work of the curators and restorers of the museum, entitled &quot;Secrets of the Museum&quot;.

The Sculpture Gallery featured in the 2023 romantic comedy &quot;Red, White &amp; Royal Blue&quot;.

<text>Banner-making is the ancient art or craft of sewing banners. Techniques used include applique, embroidery, fabric painting, patchwork and others.

==Trade union banners==

In the United Kingdom, the first of these banners were sometimes painted by local signwriters, coachpainters or decorators. More often than not, they were made by a member of the local branch who was considered to be artistic. However, from 1837 onwards, more than three quarters were made by the firm of George Tutill of Chesham in Buckinghamshire. All their banners were made from pure silk woven by Huguenots in London. At the height of banner production there were said to be 17,000 looms in operation.

The silk was stretched taut over a wooden frame and coated with India rubber, and the oil colours applied to it were &#x27;old&#x27;, i.e. had been standing around for a while. This allowed the paint to dry quickly and to make it more pliant or elastic.

There were many designs from the Bible (e.g. David slaying Goliath), from heraldry or from popular tradition, e.g. the &quot;all-seeing eye&quot;, or symbols of truth, hope or justice.

===Present===
With the advent of Conservative governments in Britain after the 1979 general election, trades union banners lost their popularity, and many languished in damp cellars or lofts. Additionally the large number of trade union mergers (see for example UNISON and Amicus) meant that many banners no longer had the correct union name on and became obsolete. In the last 10 years or so, the interest in these banners has been rekindled, and many books, videos, postcards and the like have been produced to help people rediscover and celebrate this part of the history of working men and women.

Durham Miners Gala is probably the largest current parade of trade union banners.

There are special museums which restore, preserve and exhibit trade union banners, e.g. the People&#x27;s History Museum in Manchester and Beamish Museum in the North East.

==Church banners==
Design is all-important in a banner for ecclesiastical use. The banner maker needs a sound knowledge of religious symbolism and iconography. There is also the question of its use, i.e. indoor or outdoor. If outdoor, it needs weatherproofing and must be able to be carried. Whether indoor or outdoor, proper storage provision must be made. The types of material can vary from vinyl to cloth.

<doc id="97287" wikidata="Q191815" url="?curid=97287" title="Neith">
<text>Neith (, a borrowing of the Demotic form , also spelled Nit, Net, or Neit) was an ancient Egyptian deity, possibly of Libyan origin. She was connected with warfare, as indicated by her emblem of two crossed bows, and with motherhood, as shown by texts that call her the mother of particular deities, such as the sun god Ra and the crocodile god Sobek. As a mother goddess, she was sometimes said to be the creator of the world. She also had a presence in funerary religion, and this aspect of her character grew over time: she became one of the four goddesses who protected the coffin and internal organs of the deceased.

Neith is one of the earliest Egyptian deities to appear in the archaeological record; the earliest signs of her worship date to the Naqada II period ( 3600–3350 BC). Her main cult center was the city of Sais in Lower Egypt, near the western edge of the Nile Delta, and some Egyptologists have suggested that she originated among the Libyan peoples who lived nearby. She was the most important goddess in the Early Dynastic Period ( 3100–2686 BC) and had a significant shrine at the capital, Memphis. In subsequent eras she lost her preeminence to other goddesses, such as Hathor, but she remained important, particularly during the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (664–525 BC), when Sais was Egypt&#x27;s capital. She was worshipped in many temples during the Greek and Roman periods of Egyptian history, most significantly Esna in Upper Egypt, and the Greeks identified her with their goddess Athena.

==Symbolism==

In her usual representations, she is portrayed as a fierce deity, a woman wearing the Red Crown, occasionally holding or using the bow and arrow, in others, a harpoon. Neith also is a goddess of war and of hunting and that is the symbolism depicted most often. Her symbol was two arrows crossed over a shield. The hieroglyphs of her name usually are followed by a determinative containing the archery elements, with the shield symbol of the name being explained as either double bows (facing one another), intersected by two arrows (usually lashed to the bows), or, by other imagery associated with her worship. As she is connected with weaving, the symbol is sometimes suggested to be a shuttle. Her symbol also identified the city of Sais. This symbol was displayed on top of her head in Egyptian art. In her form as a goddess of war, she was said to make the weapons of warriors and to guard their bodies when they died.

As a deity, Neith is normally shown carrying the was scepter (symbol of rule and power) and the ankh (symbol of life). She is associated with Mehet-Weret, as a cow who gives birth to the sun daily, whose name means &quot;Great Flood.&quot; In these forms, she is associated with the creation of both the primeval time and the daily &quot;re-creation&quot;. As protectress of Ra or the king, she is represented as a uraeus. In time, this led to her being considered as the personification of the primordial waters of creation.

Neith is one of the most ancient deities associated with ancient Egyptian culture. Flinders Petrie noted the earliest depictions of her standards were known in predynastic periods, as can be seen from a representation of a barque bearing her crossed arrow standards in the Predynastic Period, as is displayed in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.

Her first anthropomorphic representations occur in the early dynastic period, on a diorite vase of King Ny-Netjer of the Second Dynasty. The vase was found in the Step Pyramid of Djoser (Third Dynasty) at Saqqara. That her worship predominated the early dynastic periods is demonstrated by a preponderance of theophoric names (personal names that incorporate the name of a deity) within which Neith appears as an element. Predominance of Neith&#x27;s name in nearly forty percent of early dynastic names, and particularly in the names of four royal women of the First Dynasty, clearly emphasizes the importance of this goddess in relation to the early society of Egypt, with special emphasis on association with the Royal House.

In the very early periods of Egyptian history, the main iconographic representations of this goddess appear to have been limited to her hunting and war characteristics, although there is no Egyptian mythological reference to support the concept that this was her primary function as a deity.

It has been theorized that Neith&#x27;s primary cult point in the Old Kingdom was established in Saïs (modern Sa el-Hagar) by Hor-Aha of the First Dynasty, in an effort to placate the residents of Lower Egypt by the ruler of the unified country. Textual and iconographic evidence indicates that she was a national goddess for Old Kingdom Egypt, with her own sanctuary in Memphis, indicating the high regard held for her. There, she was known as &quot;North of her Wall&quot;, as counterpoise to Ptah&#x27;s &quot;South of his Wall&quot; epithet. While Neith is generally regarded as a deity of Lower Egypt, her worship was not consistently located in that delta region. Her cult reached its height in Saïs and apparently in Memphis in the Old Kingdom. and remained important, although to a lesser extent, through the Middle and New Kingdom. Her cult regained cultural prominence again during the Twenty-sixth Dynasty when worship at Saïs flourished again, as well as at Esna in Upper Egypt.

Neith&#x27;s symbol and part of her hieroglyph also bore a resemblance to a loom, and so in later syncretisation of Egyptian myths by the Greek ruling class of that time she was conflated with Athena, a Greek deity of war and weaving.

Sometimes Neith was pictured as a woman nursing a baby crocodile, and she then was addressed with the title, &quot;Nurse of Crocodiles&quot;, reflecting a southern provincial mythology in Upper Egypt that she served as the mother of the crocodile god, Sobek. As the mother of Ra, in her Mehet-Weret form, she was sometimes described as the &quot;Great Cow who gave birth to Ra&quot;. As a maternal figure (beyond being the birth-mother of the sun-god Ra), Neith is associated with Sobek as her son (as early as the Pyramid Texts), but in later religious conventions that paired deities, no male deity is consistently identified with her in a pair and so, she often is represented without one. Later triad associations made with her have little or no religious or mythological supporting references, appearing to have been made by political or regional associations only.

Some modern writers assert that they may interpret that as her being &#x27;androgynous&#x27;, since Neith is the creator capable of giving birth without a partner (asexually) and without association of creation with sexual imagery, as seen in the myths of Atum and other creator deities; which in turn led to her being accredited as the creator of birth itself. However, her name always appears as feminine. Erik Hornung interprets that in the Eleventh Hour of the Amduat, Neith&#x27;s name appears written with a phallus. In reference to Neith&#x27;s function as creator with both male and female characteristics, Peter Kaplony has said in the &quot;Lexikon der Ägyptologie&quot;: &quot;Die Deutung von Neith als &quot;Njt&quot; &quot;Verneinung&quot; ist sekundär. Neith ist die weibliche Entsprechung zu &quot;Nw(w&quot;), dem Gott der Urflut (Nun and Naunet).&quot; She was considered to be eldest of the Ancient Egyptian deities. Neith is said to have been &quot;born the first, in the time when as yet there had been no birth&quot;.

In the Pyramid Texts, Neith is paired with the goddess Selket as the two braces for the sky, which places these goddesses as the supports for the heavens (see PT 1040a-d, following J. Gwyn Griffths, &quot;The Conflict of Horus and Seth&quot;, (London, 1961) p. 1). This ties in with the vignette in The Contendings of Horus and Seth when, as the most ancient among them, Neith is asked by the deities to decide who should rule. She was appealed to as an arbiter in the dispute between Horus and Seth. In her message of reply, Neith selects Horus, and says she will &quot;cause the sky to crash to the earth&quot; if he is not selected.

The click beetle (likely specifically &quot;agrypnus notodonta&quot;) is one of the beetles depicted in ancient Egyptian art. The shape of the beetle resembles the shape of some ancient Egyptian shields, and necklaces with beads shaped like the beetle have been found. Additionally, the beetles have been found depicted as part of a symbol of Neith. This association appears as early as the Protodynastic period, and may be the origin of one of Neith&#x27;s stylized cult signs. The imagery of the beetle in association with Neith may have morphed over time into that of a shield.

==Attributes==

An analysis of her attributes shows Neith was a goddess with many roles. From predynastic and early dynasty periods, she was referred to as an &quot;Opener of the Ways&quot; (same as Wepwawet), which may have referred, not only to her leadership in hunting and war but also as a psychopomp in cosmic and underworld pathways, escorting souls. References to Neith as the &quot;Opener of Paths&quot; occurs in Dynasty Four through Dynasty Six, and Neith is seen in the titles of women serving as priestesses of the goddess. Such epithets include: &quot;&quot;Priestess of Neith who opens all the (path)ways&quot;, &quot;Priestess of Neith who opens the good pathways&quot;, &quot;Priestess of Neith who opens the way in all her places&quot;&quot;. (el-Sayed, I: 67-69). el-Sayed asserts his belief that Neith should be seen as a parallel to Wepwawet, the ancient jackal god of Upper Egypt, who was associated in that southern region with both royalty in victory and as a psychopomp for the dead.

The main imagery of Neith as &quot;Wepwawet&quot; was as the deity of the unseen and limitless sky, as opposed to representations of Nut and Hathor, who respectively represented the manifested night and day skies. Neith&#x27;s epithet as the &quot;Opener of the Sun&#x27;s paths in all her stations&quot; refers to how the sun is reborn (due to seasonal changes) at various points in the sky, under Neith&#x27;s control of all beyond the visible world, of which only a glimpse is revealed prior to dawn and after sunset. It is at these changing points that Neith reigns as a form of sky goddess, where the sun rises and sets daily, or at its &#x27;first appearance&#x27; to the sky above and below. It is at these points, beyond the sky that is seen, that Neith&#x27;s true power as the deity who creates life is manifested.

Georges St. Clair noted that Neith is represented at times as a cow goddess with a line of stars across her back (as opposed to representations of Nut with stars across the belly) [See el-Sayed, II, Doc. 644], and maintained this indicated that Neith represents the full ecliptic circle around the sky (above and below), and is seen iconographically in ancient texts as both the regular and the inverted determinative for the heavenly vault, indicating the cosmos below the horizon. St. Clair maintained it was this realm that Neith personified, for she is the complete sky that surrounds the upper (Nut) and lower (Nunet?) sky, and who exists beyond the horizon, and thereby, beyond the skies themselves. Neith, then, is that portion of the cosmos that is not seen, and in which the sun is reborn daily, below the horizon (which may reflect the statement assigned to Neith as &quot;I come at dawn and at sunset daily&quot;).

Since Neith also was goddess of war, she thus had an additional association with death: in this function, she shot her arrows into the enemies of the dead, and thus she began to be viewed as a protector of the dead, often appearing as a uraeus snake to drive off intruders and those who would harm the deceased (in this form she is represented in the tomb of Tutankhamun). She also is shown as the protectress of one of the Four sons of Horus, specifically Duamutef, the god who protected the stomach. Through her role as a goddess of weaving, she was associated with the wrappings of mummies.

Neith appears sporadically in the Pyramid texts, usually in association with the goddesses Isis, Nepthys, and Selket. These four initially appear as protectors of royal remains, or in other cases attendant to Osiris, Neith later would later appear in the funerary practices of commoners as well. The Coffin Texts portray Neith as involved in the judgement of the dead, and in her role as a patron goddess for weavers she is associated with the wrappings of mummies.

==Mythology==
In some ancient Egyptian creation myths, Neith was identified as the mother of Ra and Apep. When she was identified as a water goddess, she was viewed as the mother of Sobek, the crocodile. It was because of this association with water, i.e. the Nile, that during pairing of deities she sometimes was considered the wife of Khnum and sometimes was associated with the source of the River Nile. In that cult center, she also was associated with the Nile Perch as well as being the goddess of the triad.

As the goddess of creation and weaving, she was said to reweave the world on her loom daily. An interior wall of the temple at Esna records an account of creation in which Neith brings forth the Nun, the first land, from the primeval waters. All that she conceived in her heart comes into being, including all thirty deities. Having no husband she has been described as &quot;Virgin Mother Goddess&quot;:

Proclus (412–485 AD) wrote that the adyton of the temple of Neith in Sais (of which nothing now remains) carried the following inscription:

It was said that at the request of Thoth, Neith interceded in the kingly war between Horus and Set, over the Egyptian throne, recommending that Horus rule.

A great festival, called the &quot;Feast of Lamps&quot;, was held annually in honor of Neith and, according to the Greek historian Herodotus, her devotees burned a multitude of lights in the open air all night during the celebration.

==Syncretic relationships==

The Greek historian Herodotus () noted that the Egyptian citizens of Sais in Egypt worshipped Neith. In his dialogue &quot;Timaeus&quot;, the Greek philosopher Plato has Critias say that the Greek name of Neith is Athena.

The English Egyptologist E. A. Wallis Budge suggested that the Christian biblical account of the flight into Egypt as recorded in the apocryphal gospels was directly influenced by stories about Isis and Horus; Budge argued that the writers of these gospels ascribed to Mary, the mother of Jesus, many peculiarities which, at the time of the rise of Christianity, were perceived as belonging to both Isis and Neith, for example, the parthenogenesis concept shared by both Neith and Mary.

Neith has been speculated by some scholars, such as J. Gwyn Griffiths and Jan Assmann, to be the actual goddess depicted in the first and second century Greek historian Plutarch&#x27;s description of the Veil of Isis in his &quot;On Isis and Osiris.&quot; The veiled Isis is a motif which associates her with mystery and ceremonial magic. Plutarch described the statue of a seated and veiled goddess in the Egyptian city of Sais. He identified the goddess as &quot;Athena, whom [the Egyptians] consider to be Isis.&quot; However, Sais was the cult center of the goddess Neith, whom the Greeks compared to their goddess Athena, and could have been the goddess that Plutarch spoke of. More than 300 years after Plutarch, the Neoplatonist philosopher Proclus wrote of the same statue in Book I of his &quot;Commentaries on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;&quot;. In this version, a statement is added: &quot;The fruit of my womb was the sun&quot;, which could further be associated with Neith, due to her being the mother of the Sun god Ra.

<doc id="97291" wikidata="Q146313" url="?curid=97291" title="Sobek">
<text>Sobek, ), also known as Suchus (), was an ancient Egyptian deity with a complex and elastic history and nature. He is associated with the sacred and Nile crocodiles and is often represented as a crocodile-headed humanoid, if not as a crocodile outright. Sobek was also associated with pharaonic power, fertility, and military prowess, but served additionally as a protective deity with apotropaic qualities, invoked especially for protecting others from the dangers presented by the Nile. A fossil of a &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; at the Field Museum in Chicago is named after this god.

==History==
Sobek enjoyed a longstanding presence in the ancient Egyptian pantheon, from the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2686–2181 BCE) through the Roman period (). He is first known from several different Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom, particularly from spell PT 317. The spell, which praises the pharaoh as the living incarnation of the crocodile god, reads:
The origin of his name, &quot;Sbk&quot; in Egyptian, is debated among scholars, but many believe that it is derived from a causative of the verb &quot;to impregnate&quot;.
Though Sobek was worshipped in the Old Kingdom, he truly gained prominence in the Middle Kingdom (), most notably under the Twelfth Dynasty pharaoh, Amenemhat III. Amenemhat III had taken a particular interest in the Faiyum of Egypt, a region heavily associated with Sobek. Amenemhat and many of his dynastic contemporaries engaged in building projects to promote Sobek – projects that were often executed in the Faiyum. In this period, Sobek also underwent an important change: he was often fused with the falcon-headed god of divine kingship, Horus. This brought Sobek even closer with the kings of Egypt, thereby giving him a place of greater prominence in the Egyptian pantheon. The fusion added a finer level of complexity to the god&#x27;s nature, as he was adopted into the divine triad of Horus and his two parents: Osiris and Isis.
Sobek first acquired a role as a solar deity through his connection to Horus, but this was further strengthened in later periods with the emergence of Sobek-Ra, a fusion of Sobek and Egypt&#x27;s primary sun god, Ra. Sobek-Horus persisted as a figure in the New Kingdom (1550–1069 ), but it was not until the last dynasties of Egypt that Sobek-Ra gained prominence. This understanding of the god was maintained after the fall of Egypt&#x27;s last native dynasty in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt (). The prestige of both Sobek and Sobek-Ra endured in this time period and tributes to him attained greater prominence – both through the expansion of his dedicated cultic sites and a concerted scholarly effort to make him the subject of religious doctrine.

==Cult centers==
The entire Faiyum region – the &quot;Land of the Lake&quot; in Egyptian (specifically referring to Lake Moeris) – served as a cult center of Sobek. Most Faiyum towns developed their own localized versions of the god, such as Soknebtunis at Tebtunis, Sokonnokonni at Bacchias, and Souxei at an unknown site in the area. At Karanis, two forms of the god were worshipped: Pnepheros and Petsuchos. There, mummified crocodiles were employed as cult images of Petsuchos.
Sobek Shedety, the patron of the Faiyum&#x27;s centrally located capital, Crocodilopolis (or Egyptian &quot;Shedet&quot;), was the most prominent form of the god. Extensive building programs honoring Sobek were realized in Shedet, as it was the capital of the entire Arsinoite nome and consequently the most important city in the region. It is thought that the effort to expand Sobek&#x27;s main temple was initially driven by Ptolemy II. Specialized priests in the main temple at Shedet functioned solely to serve Sobek, boasting titles like &quot;prophet of the crocodile-gods&quot; and &quot;one who buries of the bodies of the crocodile-gods of the Land of the Lake&quot;. For the Greco-Roman period, the settlements Bakchias, Narmouthis, Soknopaiou Nesos, Tebtunis and Theadelphia at the edges of the Faiyum provide numerous papyri, ostraca and inscriptions that relate to temples and priests of Sobek and his local incarnations: The sources from these five settlements are central to study cult practice, temple economy and social networks of priestly families under Roman rule.

Outside the Faiyum, Kom Ombo, in southern Egypt, was the biggest cultic center of Sobek, particularly during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. Kom Ombo is located about 30 miles (48 km) north of Aswan and was built during the Graeco-Roman period (332 BCE – 395 CE). The temple at this site was called the &quot;Per-Sobek&quot;, meaning the &quot;house of Sobek&quot;.

==Character and surrounding mythologies==

Sobek is, above all else, an aggressive and animalistic deity who lives up to the vicious reputation of his patron animal, the large and violent Nile crocodile / West African crocodile. Some of his common epithets portray this nature succinctly, the most notable of which being: &quot;he who loves robbery&quot;, &quot;he who eats while he also mates&quot;, and &quot;pointed of teeth&quot;. However, he also displays grand benevolence in more than one celebrated myth. After his association with Horus and consequent adoption into the Osirian triad of Osiris, Isis, and Horus in the Middle Kingdom, Sobek became associated with Isis as a healer of the deceased Osiris (following his violent murder by Set in the central Osiris myth). In fact, though many scholars believe that the name of Sobek, &quot;Sbk&quot;, is derived from &quot;s-bAk&quot;, &quot;to impregnate&quot;, others postulate that it is a participial form of the verb &quot;sbq&quot;, an alternative writing of &quot;sAq&quot;, &quot;to unite&quot;, thereby meaning &quot;Sbk&quot; could roughly translate to &quot;he who unites (the dismembered limbs of Osiris)&quot;.

It is from this association with healing that Sobek was considered a protective deity. His fierceness was able to ward off evil while simultaneously defending the innocent. He was thus made a subject of personal piety and a common recipient of votive offerings, particularly in the later periods of ancient Egyptian history. It was not uncommon, particularly in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt, for crocodiles to be preserved as mummies to present at Sobek&#x27;s cultic centers. Sobek was also offered mummified crocodile eggs, meant to emphasize the cyclical nature of his solar attributes as Sobek-Ra.

Likewise, crocodiles were raised for religious reasons as living incarnations of Sobek. Upon their deaths, they were mummified in a grand ritual display as sacred, but earthly, manifestations of their patron god. This practice was executed specifically at the main temple of Crocodilopolis. These mummified crocodiles have been found with baby crocodiles in their mouths and on their backs. The crocodile is one of the few reptiles seen to diligently care for their young, and often transports its offspring in this manner. The practice of preserving this aspect of the animal&#x27;s behavior via mummification is likely intended to emphasize the protective and nurturing aspects of the fierce Sobek, as he protects the Egyptian people in the same manner that the crocodile protects its young.

In Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt, a local monograph called the &quot;Book of the Faiyum&quot; centered on Sobek with a considerable portion devoted to the journey made by Sobek-Ra each day with the movement of the sun through the sky. The text also focuses heavily on Sobek&#x27;s central role in creation as a manifestation of Ra, as he is said to have risen from the primal waters of Lake Moeris, not unlike the Ogdoad in the traditional creation myth of Hermopolis.

Many varied copies of the book exist and many scholars feel that it was produced in large quantities as a &quot;best-seller&quot; in antiquity. The integral relationship between the Faiyum and Sobek is highlighted via this text, and his far reaching influence is seen in localities that are outside the Faiyum as well; a portion of the book is copied on the Upper Egyptian (meaning southern Egyptian) Temple of Kom Ombo.

<text>Jah or Yah (, &quot;Yāh&quot;) is a short form of the tetragrammaton (YHWH), the personal name of God: Yahweh, which the ancient Israelites used. The conventional Christian English pronunciation of &quot;Jah&quot; is , even though the letter J here transliterates the palatal approximant (Hebrew י Yodh). The spelling &quot;Yah&quot; is designed to make the pronunciation explicit in an English-language context (see also romanization of Hebrew), especially for Christians who may not use Hebrew regularly during prayer and study.

This short form of the name occurs 50 times in the text of the Hebrew Bible, of which 24 form part of the phrase &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, a phrase that continues to be employed by Jews and Christians to give praise to Yahweh. In the Christian King James Version (1611) there is a single instance of &quot;JAH&quot; (capitalized), in Psalm 68:4. &quot;An American Translation&quot; (1939) and the New King James Version &quot;NKJV&quot; (1982) follows KJV in using &quot;Yah&quot; in this verse.

While pronouncing the tetragrammaton is forbidden for Jews, articulating &quot;Jah&quot;/&quot;Yah&quot; is allowed, but is usually confined to prayer and study. 

The name &quot;Jah&quot; is frequently employed by adherents of Rastafari to refer to God.

==Etymology==

The name of the national god of the kingdoms of Israel (Samaria) and Judah is written in the Hebrew Bible as יהוה (YHWH), which modern scholars often render as &quot;Yahweh&quot;. The short form &quot;Jah/Yah&quot;, appears in Exodus 15:2 and 17:16, Psalm 89:9, (arguably, by emendation) Song of Songs 8:6, as well as in the phrase &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. The name of Yahweh is also incorporated into several theophoric names, however, in almost all cases the Hebrew name itself uses &quot;-yāhū&quot;, not &quot;-yāh&quot;. This does not preclude the translation of several &quot;-yāhū&quot; names without the added &quot;ū&quot;, such as Elijah (&quot;ʾĒlīyyāhū&quot;) or Hezekiah (&quot;H̱īzəqīyyahū&quot;), or the existence of several Hebrew names which &quot;do&quot; use the &quot;-yāh&quot; form, such as Jedidjah, Malchijah, and Adonijah.

== In the Tanakh ==
Yah occurs 50 times: 43 times in the Psalms, in Exodus 15:2; 17:16; and Isaiah 12:2; 26:4, as well as twice in Isaiah 38:11.

== In the Christian New Testament ==
At Revelation 19:1-6, &quot;Jah&quot; is embedded in the phrase &quot;hallelujah&quot; (Tiberian &quot;halləlûyāh&quot;), a Hebrew expression that literally means &quot;Praise Jah&quot;. The short form &quot;IA&quot; (Yah or Jah (יה)) in the phrase hallelouia (Ἁλληλουιά) is transcribed by the Greek &quot;ia&quot;.

==Jewish and Christian Bibles==
In the King James Version of the Christian Bible, the Hebrew יהּ is transliterated as &quot;JAH&quot; (capitalised) in only one instance: &quot;Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him&quot;. &quot;An American Translation&quot; renders the Hebrew word as &quot;Yah&quot; in this verse. In the 1885 Revised Version and its annotated study edition, The Modern Reader&#x27;s Bible, which uses the Revised Version as its base text, also transliterates &quot;JAH&quot; in Psalms 89:8 which reads, &quot;O LORD God of hosts, who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O JAH? and thy faithfulness is round about thee&quot;.

With the rise of the Reformation, reconstructions of the Tetragrammaton became popular. The Tyndale Bible was the first English translation to use the anglicized reconstruction. The modern letter &quot;J&quot; settled on its current English pronunciation only around 500 years ago; in Ancient Hebrew, the first consonant of the Tetragrammaton always represents a &quot;Y&quot; sound.

Rotherham&#x27;s &quot;Emphasised Bible&quot; includes 49 uses of &quot;Jah&quot;. In the &quot;Sacred Scriptures Bethel Edition&quot; Bible, the Jerusalem Bible, and the New Jerusalem Bible (prior to 1998) the name &quot;YHWH&quot; and its abbreviated form &quot;Yah&quot; is found. The &quot;New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures&quot;, used primarily by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, employs &quot;Jah&quot; in the Hebrew Scriptures, and translates &quot;Hallelujah&quot; as &quot;Praise Jah&quot; in the Greek Scriptures. The Divine Name King James Bible employs &quot;JAH&quot; in 50 instances within the Old Testament according to the Divine Name Concordance of the Divine Name King James Bible, Second Edition.

The Spanish language Reina Valera Bible employs &quot;JAH&quot; in 21 instances within the Old Testament according to the &quot;Nueva Concordancia Strong Exhaustiva&quot;. The Darby Bible, Young&#x27;s Literal Translation, The Jubilee Bible 2000, Lexham English Bible, The Complete Jewish Bible, Names of God Bible, The Recovery Version, Green&#x27;s Literal Translation, the New Jewish Publication Society or NJPS Tanakh and World English Bible includes &quot;Jah&quot; (Yah in the Lexham English Bible, Complete Jewish Bible, the NJPS Tanakh and the World English Bible) numerous times within the Old Testament (as well as in the New Testament or New Covenant as is the case in Christian and Messianic Jewish Bibles) as &quot;Hallelujah!&quot; or &quot;Alleluia!&quot; (Praise Jah or Yah in either instance) which is also employed throughout the Old Testament of these Bible versions.

&quot;Hallelujah!&quot; or &quot;Alleluia!&quot; is also used in other Bible versions such as the Divine Name King James Bible, American Standard Version, the Recovery Version, The Tree of Life Version, Amplified Bible, God&#x27;s Word Translation, Holman Christian Standard Bible, International Standard Version, The Message, New American Bible Revised Edition, The Jerusalem Bible, The New Jerusalem Bible, NJPS Tanakh, The first JPS translation, The Living Bible, The Bible in Living English, Young&#x27;s Literal Translation, King James Version, The Spanish language Reina Valera and even in Bible versions that otherwise do not generally use the Divine Name such as the New King James Version, English Standard Version, J.B. Phillips New Testament, New International Version, Douay-Rheims Version, God&#x27;s Word Translation, Revised Standard Version, New Revised Standard Version, The Jubilee Bible 2000, New American Standard Bible, New Century Version, New International Reader&#x27;s Version and several other versions, translations and/or editions in English and other languages varying from once to numerous times depending on the Bible version especially and most notably in Revelation Chapter 19 in Christian and Messianic Jewish Bibles.

== Rastafari usage ==

Rastafari use the name &quot;Jah&quot; as a term for the Lord God or Haile Selassie, who some Rastafari regard as the incarnation of the God of the Old Testament or as the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, who is also known by the Ethiopian title &quot;Janhoy&quot;.

<text>Iah (; 𓇋𓂝𓎛𓇹, Coptic ) is a lunar deity in ancient Egyptian religion. The word &quot;jꜥḥ&quot; simply means &quot;Moon&quot;. It is also transcribed as &quot;Yah&quot;, &quot;Jah&quot;, &quot;Aa&quot;, or &quot;Aah&quot;.

==Worship==
By the New Kingdom (16th century to 11th century BC) he was less prominent than other gods with lunar connections, Thoth and Khonsu. As a result of the functional connection between them, he could be identified with either of those deities.

Iah was sometimes considered an adult form of Khonsu and was increasingly absorbed by him. He continued to appear in amulets and occasional other representations, similar to Khonsu in appearance, with the same lunar symbols on his head and occasionally the same tight garments. He differed in usually wearing a full wig instead of a child&#x27;s sidelock, and sometimes the Atef topped by another symbol. As time went on, Iah also became Iah-Djehuty, meaning &quot;god of the new moon&quot;. In this role, he assumed the lunar aspect of Thoth (also known as Djehuty), who was the god of knowledge, writing and calculation. The segments of the moon were also used as fractional symbols in writing.

Iah was also assimilated with Osiris, god of the dead, perhaps because, in its monthly cycle, the Moon appears to renew itself.

<text>Senet or senat (; cf. Coptic , &#x27;passing, afternoon&#x27;) is a board game from ancient Egypt that consists of ten or more pawns on a 30-square playing board. The earliest representation of senet is dated to 2620 BCE from the Mastaba of Hesy-Re, while similar boards and hieroglyphic signs are found even earlier, including in the Levant in the Early Bronze Age II period. Even though the game has a 2,000-year history in Egypt, there appears to be very little variation in terms of key components. This can be determined by studying the various senet boards that have been found by archaeologists, as well as depictions of senet being played throughout Egyptian history on places like tomb walls and papyrus scrolls. However, the game fell out of use during the Roman period, and its original rules are the subject of conjecture.

== History ==
Fragmentary boards that could be senet have been found in First Dynasty burials in Egypt, 3100 BCE. The first unequivocal painting of this ancient game is from the Third Dynasty tomb of the high official Hesy ( 2686–2613 BCE). People are depicted playing senet in a painting in the tomb of the Fifth Dynasty vizier Rashepses as well as from other tombs of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties ( 2500 BCE). There are depictions of individuals such as Tutankhamun and Nefertari (wife of Ramesses II) playing senet in tomb art as well during the New Kingdom.

Senet is depicted in ancient texts, including in Chapter 17 of the Book of the Dead, where the individual who has died plays the game against an invisible opponent. The game of senet is also depicted in a scene depicted on papyrus dating from roughly 1250–1150 BCE that shows a lion and a gazelle playing senet (in the possession of the British Museum).

A game that could be &quot;senet&quot; is also referenced in the Roman-era Egyptian literary work that has been given the title in modern times of &quot;Setne Khamwas and Si-Osire&quot;. In this story, Naneferkaptah challenges Setne to a board game, with the winner taking a book he had been looking for as a prize. The game in this story is not explicitly stated; however, similarities such as the religious implications and structure of the game support the idea that it could be senet being depicted.

The oldest intact senet boards date to the Middle Kingdom, but graffiti on Fifth and Sixth Dynasty monuments could date as early as the Old Kingdom. However, there have been no actual senet boards that have been dated to the Fourth through Sixth Dynasties, just evidence that they did exist from depictions in tombs. In a painting from the Third Dynasty tomb of Hesy-Re, a senet game is depicted along with other boardgames from this era.

A study on a senet board in the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, dating back to the early New Kingdom of Egypt, showed the evolution of the game from its secular origins into a more religious artefact. However, the archaeological context of this senet board in question is unknown—it was acquired by the Rosicrucian Museum in London in 1947, and due to poor archaeological practices of the time, the provenance at this point appears to not have been recorded.

Some historians believe that senet could have originated in the Levant before Egypt; however, due to Egypt&#x27;s involvement in the Levant, Egyptian influence could have introduced the game. Senet was also adopted in Cyprus around the end of the third millennium BCE and continued until at least the Bronze Age.

Though some historians argue that senet essentially disappeared after the Romans, there are some examples of senet graffiti on the roof of the Roman Temple of Dendera, which dates to the Roman period, and which would be the most concrete evidence that the game was played or did exist to some extent during the Roman period.

Senet was rediscovered and reintroduced to the world by Egyptologists during archaeological excavations in Egypt in the 1930s. As no complete record of the game&#x27;s rules survived, the Swiss archaeologist Gustave Jéquier analyzed recovered senet boards and artistic depictions of senet to devise a conjectural set of rules for the game, which precipitated the initial revival of senet in the modern era. The Jéquier rules were eventually usurped by alternative sets of rules that were reconstructed in the latter half of the 20th century by the Canadian historian R. C. Bell and the American archaeologist Dr. Timothy Kendall. Various other Egyptologists have proposed additional rule sets over the years, but these have generally been discredited by subsequent archaeological findings.

==Rules==
===Equipment===

The senet board itself was usually constructed out of wood, ivory, faience, or some combination of these materials, and the layout of the board was a grid of 30 squares, called &quot;houses&quot;, arranged in three rows of ten. A complete senet game set would have contained a distinct set of five pawns for each of the two players. At least by the New Kingdom, these pieces were in the form of hounds or dog-headed figurines. Through most of the game&#x27;s 2,000-year history, the senet boards themselves would indicate the direction of play, usually from the top left corner and indicated by the decorations on the spaces. The last five squares were often the most decorated on the board. The decorations on the last five squares were unique, usually having a mark related to goodness or an aquatic reference on them.

===Original rules===
Due to the game falling out of use during the Roman period, the exact original rules of senet are not known.

At least by the New Kingdom in Egypt (1550–1077 BCE), the game reflected the concept of the &quot;ka&quot; passing through the duat—represented in the game by the spaces connecting the individual to different stages of their lives. This connection is made in the &quot;Great Game Text&quot;, which appears in a number of papyri, as well as the appearance of markings of religious significance on senet boards themselves.

===Modern rules===

Although details of the original game rules are a subject of some conjecture, historians Timothy Kendall and R. C. Bell have made their own reconstructions of the game rules. These rules are based on snippets of texts that span over a thousand years, over which time gameplay is likely to have changed. Therefore, it is unlikely these rules reflect the exact course of ancient Egyptian gameplay. However, their rules have been adopted by sellers of modern senet sets.

====Kendall====
In Dr. Timothy Kendall&#x27;s rules, the object of the game is for one player to advance all five of their pawns across the senet board and remove them before the second player does so. The game&#x27;s length can be extended by increasing the number of pawns allocated to each player as desired, to a maximum of ten pawns per player. The original iteration of Kendall&#x27;s rules published in 1979 called for seven pawns per player.

Players take turns and begin by throwing a set of four flat wooden sticks with one side painted white and the other side painted black (or differentiated by some other means), equivalent to two-sided dice. The number of sticks that land on white determines how far a single pawn may advance that turn. One white stick and three black sticks signifies that the player may advance one of their pawns forward by 1 house, two white sticks means the pawn can advance by 2 houses, and so on. If all four sticks land on black, then the pawn can advance by 5 houses.
The player selects a pawn and places it on the senet board starting at the first house (numbered 1 in the chart on the right), then moves the pawn forward according to the result of the stick roll. If doing this will result in a pawn coming to rest on a house already occupied by one of their pawns, they must move the newer pawn backward to the first empty house. If the house is occupied by a pawn belonging to the opposing player, then the opponent&#x27;s pawn can be captured: the player may optionally choose to place their own pawn in the occupied house, then move the opposing player&#x27;s pawn backward to the first empty house available. Players can move their pawns ahead of each other&#x27;s pawns as necessary with one exception: if a player forms a line of three or more of their pawns on contiguous, sequential houses, then the other player cannot move any of their own pawns past that formation.

The five decorated houses on the senet board plus House 30, the final house, each have special rules that must be followed:

*House 15, &quot;the Ankh&quot;: Behaves like a standard, non-decorated house, but is tied to House 27 as described below.
*House 26, &quot;the House of Happiness&quot;: Pawns cannot bypass this house under any circumstance, each pawn must land on it at least once before it can be legally taken off the board.
*House 27, &quot;the House of Water&quot;: Any pawn that lands on House 27 must be immediately moved to House 15 or to the first empty house preceding House 15.
*House 28, &quot;the House of Three Truths&quot;: Any pawn that lands on House 28 cannot be moved to any other house, and capturing is prohibited. The player can remove their pawn from the board on the first turn that they roll exactly 3 white sticks.
*House 29, &quot;the House of Re-Atoum&quot;: Any pawn that lands on House 29 cannot be moved to any other house, and capturing is prohibited. The player can remove their pawn from the board on the first turn that they roll exactly 2 white sticks.
*House 30, &quot;the House of Horus&quot;: Any pawn that lands on House 30 can still be captured. The player can remove their pawn from the board on the first turn that they roll exactly 1 white stick, or if the first row of the senet board (Houses 1 through 10) is not occupied by any pawns.

====Bell====
R.C. Bell&#x27;s rules, also first published in 1979, are mostly identical to Kendall&#x27;s except on the following points. Both players always begin with ten pawns each. All pawns are placed on the board from the start of the game, beginning with a white pawn in House 1, then a black pawn in House 2, and so on until the first two rows of the board are filled. In place of sticks, players take turns rolling a single four-sided die, and turn priority is determined at the start by whoever rolls a higher number. Capturing is mandatory when the opportunity presents itself, but the capturing player confiscates the opposing pawn and removes it from the board, which prevents the opponent from being able to score it. As for the five decorated houses, they have simpler special rules: pawns on those houses cannot be captured, but their owners can take them off the board and score them on the first turn that they roll a specific number. The game ends when the board is emptied, and the winner is whoever scored the most of their own pawns.

<doc id="97301" wikidata="Q32143" url="?curid=97301" title="Hapi (Nile god)">
<text>Hapi (Ancient Egyptian: &quot;ḥꜥpj&quot;) Also spelled Hapy was the god of the annual flooding of the Nile in ancient Egyptian religion. The flood deposited rich silt (fertile soil) on the river&#x27;s banks, allowing the Egyptians to grow crops. Hapi was greatly celebrated among the Egyptians. Some of the titles of Hapi were &quot;Lord of the Fish and Birds of the Marshes&quot; and &quot;Lord of the River Bringing Vegetation&quot;. Hapi is typically depicted as an androgynous figure with a prominent belly and large drooping breasts, wearing a loincloth and ceremonial false beard, depicted in hieroglyphics as an intersex person.

==Mythology==

The annual flooding of the Nile occasionally was said to be the &quot;Arrival of Hapi&quot;. Since this flooding provided fertile soil in an area that was otherwise desert, Hapi symbolised fertility. He had large female breasts because he was said to bring a rich and nourishing harvest. Due to his fertile nature he was sometimes considered the &quot;father of the gods&quot;, and was considered to be a caring father who helped to maintain the balance of the cosmos, the world or universe regarded as an orderly, harmonious system. He was thought to live within a cavern at the supposed source of the Nile near Aswan. The cult of Hapi was mainly located at the First Cataract named Elephantine. His priests were involved in rituals to ensure the steady levels of flow required from the annual flood. At Elephantine the official nilometer, a measuring device, was carefully monitored to predict the level of the flood, and his priests must have been intimately concerned with its monitoring.

Hapi was not regarded as the god of the Nile itself but of the inundation event. He was also considered a &quot;friend of Geb&quot;, the Egyptian god of the earth, and the &quot;lord of Neper&quot;, the god of grain.

==Iconography==

Although male and wearing the false beard, Hapi was pictured with pendulous breasts and a large stomach, as representations of the fertility of the Nile. He was usually given blue or green skin, representing water. Other attributes varied, depending upon the region of Egypt in which the depictions exist. In Lower Egypt, he was adorned with papyrus plants and attended by frogs, present in the region, and symbols of it. Whereas in Upper Egypt, it was the lotus and crocodiles which were more present in the Nile, thus these were the symbols of the region, and those associated with Hapi there. Hapi often was pictured carrying offerings of food or pouring water from an amphora, but also, very rarely, was depicted as a hippopotamus. During the Nineteenth Dynasty Hapi is often depicted as a pair of figures, each holding and tying together the long stem of two plants representing Upper and Lower Egypt, symbolically binding the two halves of the country around a hieroglyph meaning &quot;union&quot;. This symbolic representation was often carved at the base of seated statues of the pharaoh.
Egyptian historian Al Maqrizi (1364–1442) related in his &quot;El Khutat El Maqrizia (The Maqrizian Plans) that living virgins were sacrificed annually as &quot;brides of the Nile&quot; (&quot;Arous El Nil&quot;) and this has been historically accepted as late as the 1970s, but this claim is disputed by some Egyptologists such as Bassam El Shammaa.

<text>The Intel 8085 (&quot;eighty-eighty-five&quot;) is an 8-bit microprocessor produced by Intel and introduced in March 1976. It is the last 8-bit microprocessor developed by Intel.

It is software-binary compatible with the more-famous Intel 8080 with only two minor instructions added to support its added interrupt and serial input/output features. However, it requires less support circuitry, allowing simpler and less expensive microcomputer systems to be built.

The &quot;5&quot; in the part number highlighted the fact that the 8085 uses a single +5-volt (V) power supply by using depletion-mode transistors, rather than requiring the +5 V, −5 V and +12 V supplies needed by the 8080. This capability matched that of the competing Z80, a popular 8080-derived CPU introduced the year before. These processors could be used in computers running the CP/M operating system.

The 8085 is supplied in a 40-pin DIP package. To maximise the functions on the available pins, the 8085 uses a multiplexed address/data (AD0-AD7) bus. However, an 8085 circuit requires an 8-bit address latch, so Intel manufactured several support chips with an address latch built in. These include the 8755, with an address latch, 2 KB of EPROM and 16 I/O pins, and the 8155 with 256 bytes of RAM, 22 I/O pins and a 14-bit programmable timer/counter. The multiplexed address/data bus reduced the number of PCB tracks between the 8085 and such memory and I/O chips.

Both the 8080 and the 8085 were eclipsed by the Zilog Z80 for desktop computers, which took over most of the CP/M computer market, as well as a share of the booming home-computer market in the early-to-mid-1980s.

The 8085 had a long life as a controller, no doubt thanks to its built-in serial I/O and five prioritized interrupts, arguably microcontroller-like features that the Z80 CPU did not have. Once designed into such products as the DECtape II controller and the VT102 video terminal in the late 1970s, the 8085 served for new production throughout the lifetime of those products. This was typically longer than the product life of desktop computers.
==Description==
The 8085 is a conventional von Neumann design based on the Intel 8080. Unlike the 8080 it does not multiplex state signals onto the data bus, but the 8-bit data bus is instead multiplexed with the lower eight bits of the 16-bit address bus to limit the number of pins to 40. State signals are provided by dedicated bus control signal pins and two dedicated bus state ID pins named S0 and S1. Pin 40 is used for the power supply (+5 V) and pin 20 for ground. Pin 39 is used as the Hold pin.

The Intel 8085 processor was designed using nMOS circuitry, with later &quot;H&quot; versions implemented in Intel&#x27;s enhanced nMOS process known as HMOS II (&quot;High-performance MOS&quot;), which was originally developed for fast static RAM products. Unlike the 8080, the 8085 requires only a single 5-volt power supply, similar to its competing processors. The 8085 contains approximately 6,500 transistors.

The 8085 incorporates the functions of the 8224 (clock generator) and the 8228 (system controller) on chip, increasing the level of integration. A downside compared to similar contemporary designs (such as the Z80) is the fact that the buses require demultiplexing; however, address latches in the Intel 8155, 8355, and 8755 memory chips allow a direct interface, so an 8085 along with these chips is almost a complete system.

The 8085 has extensions to support new interrupts, with three maskable vectored interrupts (RST 7.5, RST 6.5 and RST 5.5), one non-maskable interrupt (TRAP), and one externally serviced interrupt (INTR). Each of these five interrupts has a separate pin on the processor, a feature which permits simple systems to avoid the cost of a separate interrupt controller. The RST 7.5 interrupt is edge triggered (latched), while RST 5.5 and 6.5 are level-sensitive. All interrupts except TRAP are enabled by the EI instruction and disabled by the DI instruction. In addition, the SIM (Set Interrupt Mask) and RIM (Read Interrupt Mask) instructions, the only instructions of the 8085 that are not from the 8080 design, allow each of the three maskable RST interrupts to be individually masked. All three are masked after a normal CPU reset. SIM and RIM also allow the global interrupt mask state and the three independent RST interrupt mask states to be read, the pending-interrupt states of those same three interrupts to be read, the RST 7.5 trigger-latch flip-flop to be reset (cancelling the pending interrupt without servicing it), and serial data to be sent and received via the SOD and SID pins, respectively, all under program control and independently of each other.

SIM and RIM each execute in four clock cycles (T states), making it possible to sample SID and/or toggle SOD considerably faster than it is possible to toggle or sample a signal via any I/O or memory-mapped port, e.g. one of the port of an 8155. (In this way, SID can be compared to the SO [&quot;Set Overflow&quot;] pin of the 6502 CPU contemporary to the 8085.)

Like the 8080, the 8085 can accommodate slower memories through externally generated wait states (pin 35, READY), and has provisions for Direct Memory Access (DMA) using HOLD and HLDA signals (pins 39 and 38). An improvement over the 8080 is that the 8085 can itself drive a piezoelectric crystal directly connected to it, and a built-in clock generator generates the internal high-amplitude two-phase clock signals at half the crystal frequency (a 6.14 MHz crystal would yield a 3.07 MHz clock, for instance). The internal clock is available on an output pin, to drive peripheral devices or other CPUs in lock-step synchrony with the CPU from which the signal is output. The 8085 can also be clocked by an external oscillator (making it feasible to use the 8085 in synchronous multi-processor systems using a system-wide common clock for all CPUs, or to synchronize the CPU to an external time reference such as that from a video source or a high-precision time reference).

The 8085 is a binary compatible follow-up on the 8080. It supports the complete instruction set of the 8080, with exactly the same instruction behavior, including all effects on the CPU flags (except for the AND/ANI operation, which sets the AC flag differently). This means that the vast majority of object code (any program image in ROM or RAM) that runs successfully on the 8080 can run directly on the 8085 without translation or modification. (Exceptions include timing-critical code and code that is sensitive to the aforementioned difference in the AC flag setting or differences in undocumented CPU behavior.) 8085 instruction timings differ slightly from the 8080—some 8-bit operations, including INR, DCR, and the heavily used MOV r,r&#x27; instruction, are one clock cycle faster, but instructions that involve 16-bit operations, including stack operations (which increment or decrement the 16-bit SP register) generally one cycle slower.
It is of course possible that the actual 8080 and/or 8085 differs from the published specifications, especially in subtle details. (The same is not true of the Z80.) As mentioned already, only the SIM and RIM instructions were new to the 8085.

===Programming model===
The processor has seven 8-bit registers accessible to the programmer, named A, B, C, D, E, H, and L, where A is also known as the accumulator. The other six registers can be used as independent byte-registers or as three 16-bit register pairs, BC, DE, and HL (or B, D, H, as referred to in Intel documents), depending on the particular instruction.

Some instructions use HL as a (limited) 16-bit accumulator. As in the 8080, the contents of the memory address pointed to by HL can be accessed as pseudo register M. It also has a 16-bit program counter and a 16-bit stack pointer to memory (replacing the 8008&#x27;s internal stack). Instructions such as PUSH PSW, POP PSW affect the Program Status Word (accumulator and flags). The accumulator stores the results of arithmetic and logical operations, and the flags register bits (sign, zero, auxiliary carry, parity, and carry flags) are set or cleared according to the results of these operations. The sign flag is set if the result has a negative sign (i.e. it is set if bit 7 of the accumulator is set). The auxiliary or half carry flag is set if a carryover from bit 3 to bit 4 occurred. The parity flag is set to 1 if the parity (number of 1-bits) of the accumulator is even; if odd, it is cleared. The zero flag is set if the result of the operation was 0. Lastly, the carry flag is set if a carryover from bit 7 of the accumulator (the MSB) occurred.

===Commands/instructions===
As in many other 8-bit processors, all instructions are encoded in a single byte (including register-numbers, but excluding immediate data), for simplicity. Some of them are followed by one or two bytes of data, which can be an immediate operand, a memory address, or a port number. A NOP &quot;no operation&quot; instruction exists, but does not modify any of the registers or flags. Like larger processors, it has CALL and RET instructions for multi-level procedure calls and returns (which can be conditionally executed, like jumps) and instructions to save and restore any 16-bit register-pair on the machine stack. There are also eight one-byte call instructions (RST) for subroutines located at the fixed addresses 00h, 08h, 10h...,38h. These are intended to be supplied by external hardware in order to invoke a corresponding interrupt-service routine, but are also often employed as fast system calls. One sophisticated instruction is XTHL, which is used for exchanging the register pair HL with the value stored at the address indicated by the stack pointer.

====8-bit instructions====
All two-operand 8-bit arithmetic and logical (ALU) operations work on the 8-bit accumulator (the A register). For two-operand 8-bit operations, the other operand can be either an immediate value, another 8-bit register, or a memory cell addressed by the 16-bit register pair HL. The only 8-bit ALU operations that can have a destination other than the accumulator are the unary incrementation or decrementation instructions, which can operate on any 8-bit register or on memory addressed by HL, as for two-operand 8-bit operations. Direct copying is supported between any two 8-bit registers and between any 8-bit register and an HL-addressed memory cell, using the MOV instruction. An immediate value can also be moved into any of the foregoing destinations, using the MVI instruction. Due to the regular encoding of the MOV instruction (using nearly a quarter of the entire opcode space) there are redundant codes to copy a register into itself (&quot;MOV B,B&quot;, for instance), which are of little use, except for delays. However, what would have been a copy from the HL-addressed cell into itself (i.e., &quot;MOV M,M&quot;) instead encodes the HLT instruction, halting execution until an external reset or unmasked interrupt occurs. 

====16-bit operations====
Although the 8085 is an 8-bit processor, it has some 16-bit operations. Any of the three 16-bit register pairs (BC, DE, HL) or SP can be loaded with an immediate 16-bit value (using LXI), incremented or decremented (using INX and DCX), or added to HL (using DAD). LHLD loads HL from directly addressed memory and SHLD stores HL likewise. The XCHG operation exchanges the values of HL and DE. XTHL exchanges last item pushed on stack with HL. Adding HL to itself performs a 16-bit arithmetic left shift with one instruction. The only 16-bit instruction that affects any flag is DAD (adding BC, DE, HL, or SP to HL), which updates the carry flag to facilitate 24-bit or larger additions and left shifts. Adding the stack pointer to HL is useful for indexing variables in (recursive) stack frames. A stack frame can be allocated using DAD SP and SPHL, and a branch to a computed pointer can be done with PCHL. These abilities make it feasible to compile languages such as PL/M, Pascal, or C with 16-bit variables and produce 8085 machine code. Subtraction and bitwise logical operations on 16 bits is done in 8-bit steps. Operations that have to be implemented by program code (subroutine libraries) include comparisons of signed integers as well as multiplication and division.

====Undocumented instructions====
A number of undocumented instructions and flags were discovered by two software engineers, Wolfgang Dehnhardt and Villy M. Sorensen in the process of developing an 8085 assembler. These instructions use 16-bit operands and include indirect loading and storing of a word, a subtraction, a shift, a rotate, and offset operations.

By the time 8085 was designed but not yet announced, many designers found it to be inferior to the competing products already on the market. The next generation 16-bit 8086 CPU was already in development. Intel made a last minute decision to leave 10 out of 12 new 8085 instructions undocumented to speed up and simplify the design of the upcoming 8086 CPU.

===Input/output scheme===
The 8085 supports both port-mapped and memory-mapped I/O. It supports up to 256 input/output (I/O) ports via dedicated Input/Output instructions, with port addresses as operands. Port-mapped IO can be an advantage on processors with limited address space. During a port-mapped I/O bus cycle, the 8-bit I/O address is output by the CPU on both the lower and upper halves of the 16-bit address bus.

Devices designed for memory mapped I/O can also be accessed by using the LDA (load accumulator from a 16-bit address) and STA (store accumulator at a 16-bit address specified) instructions, or any other instructions that have memory operands. A memory-mapped IO transfer cycle appears on the bus as a normal memory access cycle.

===Development system===

Intel produced a series of development systems for the 8080 and 8085, known as the MDS-80 Microprocessor System. The original development system had an 8080 processor. Later 8085 and 8086 support was added including ICE (in-circuit emulators). It is a large and heavy desktop box, about a 20&quot; cube (in the Intel corporate blue color) which includes a CPU, monitor, and a single 8-inch floppy disk drive. Later an external box was made available with two more floppy drives. It runs the ISIS operating system and can also operate an emulator pod and an external EPROM programmer. This unit uses the Multibus card cage which was intended just for the development system. A surprising number of spare card cages and processors were being sold, leading to the development of the Multibus as a separate product.

The later iPDS is a portable unit, about 8&quot;16&quot;20&quot;, with a handle. It has a small green screen, a keyboard built into the top, a 5¼ inch floppy disk drive, and runs the ISIS-II operating system. It can also accept a second 8085 processor, allowing a limited form of multi-processor operation where both processors run simultaneously and independently. The screen and keyboard can be switched between them, allowing programs to be assembled on one processor (large programs took a while) while files are edited in the other. It has a bubble memory option and various programming modules, including EPROM, and Intel 8048 and 8051 programming modules which are plugged into the side, replacing stand-alone device programmers. In addition to an 8080/8085 assembler, Intel produced a number of compilers including those for PL/M-80 and Pascal, and a set of tools for linking and statically locating programs to enable them to be burned into EPROMs and used in embedded systems.

A lower cost &quot;MCS-85 System Design Kit&quot; (SDK-85) board contains an 8085 CPU, an 8355 ROM containing a debugging monitor program, an 8155 RAM and 22 I/O ports, an 8279 hex keypad and 8-digit 7-segment LED, and a TTY (Teletype) current loop serial interface. Pads are available for one more 2K×8 8755 EPROM, and another RAM 8155 I/O Timer/Counter can be optionally added. All data, control, and address signals are available on dual pin headers, and a large prototyping area is provided.

===List of Intel 8085 Models===


==Applications==
The 8085 processor was used in a few early personal computers, for example, the TRS-80 Model 100 line used an OKI manufactured 80C85 (MSM80C85ARS). The CMOS version 80C85 of the NMOS/HMOS 8085 processor has several manufacturers. In the Soviet Union, an 80C85 clone was developed under the designation IM1821VM85A () 2016 was still in production. Some manufacturers provide variants with additional functions such as additional instructions.

The radiation hardened version of the 8085 has been in on-board instrument data processors for several NASA and ESA space physics missions in the 1990s and early 2000s, including CRRES, Polar, FAST, Cluster, HESSI, the Sojourner Mars Rover, and THEMIS. The Swiss company SAIA used the 8085 and the 8085–2 as the CPUs of their PCA1 line of programmable logic controllers during the 1980s.

Pro-Log Corp. put the 8085 and supporting hardware on an STD Bus format card containing CPU, RAM, sockets for ROM/EPROM, I/O and external bus interfaces. The included Instruction Set Reference Card uses entirely different mnemonics for the Intel 8085 CPU. The product was a direct competitor to Intel&#x27;s Multibus card offerings.

==MCS-85 family==
The 8085 CPU is one part of a family of chips developed by Intel for building a complete system. Many of these support chips were also used with other processors. The original IBM PC based on the Intel 8088 processor used several of these chips; the equivalent functions today are provided by VLSI chips, namely the &quot;Southbridge&quot; chips.

==Educational use==
In many engineering schools the 8085 processor is used in introductory microprocessor courses. Trainer kits composed of a printed circuit board, 8085, and supporting hardware are offered by various companies. These kits usually include complete documentation allowing a student to go from soldering to assembly language programming in a single course. Also, the architecture and instruction set of the 8085 are easy for a student to understand. Shared Project versions of educational and hobby 8085-based single-board computers are noted below in the External Links section of this article.

==Simulators==
Software simulators are available for the 8085 microprocessor, which allow simulated execution of opcodes in a graphical environment.

<text>The Mesta () was a powerful association protecting livestock owners and their animals in the Crown of Castile that was incorporated in the 13th century and was dissolved in 1836. Although best known for its organisation of the annual migration of transhumant sheep, particularly those of the Merino breed, the flocks and herds of all species of livestock in Castile and their owners were under the oversight of the Mesta, including both the transhumant and the sedentary ones. The transhumant sheep were generally owned in Old Castile and León, where they had their summer pastures, and they migrated to and from winter pastures of Extremadura and Andalusia according to the season.

The royal protection for the Mesta&#x27;s flocks and herds was signified by the term &quot;Cabaña Real&quot; ( that applied to these protected animals. The kings of Castile conceded many other privileges to the Mesta. The &quot;s&quot; (traditional rights-of-way for sheep or sheep-walks) were legally protected in perpetuity from being built on, cultivated or blocked, and they still are protected public domain in our days. The most important &quot;cañadas&quot; were called , because they were established by royal decrees.

The origin of the Mesta is related to the growth of transhumance after the Castilian conquest of the Taifa of Toledo. Three groups were granted royal charters including the rights to winter pasturage in the Tagus valley. The first were monasteries that owned summer pastures in the Sierra de Guadarrama, followed by the religious military orders which had acquired lands after the conquest of Toledo, in the area renamed New Castile. Later, the urban elites of Old Castile and León, who used urban grazing in the city&#x27;s &quot;término&quot; (, including its pasturage on nearby sierras, were granted similar rights. None of these groups, nor the few lay members of the nobility that also received such grants, could base their wealth on crop-growing in the dry and underpopulated lands of New Castile, so relied on raising livestock.

Initially, the Mesta included both large and small livestock owners and was controlled by them, however, from the time of Charles V, the organisation ceased to be controlled exclusively by such owners, as royal officials, who were leading nobles and ecclesiastics and not necessarily stock-owners, were appointed to its governing body. Although wool exports began in the 14th century, it was only when the export of high-quality merino wool was stimulated in the late 15th century by a sales tax exemption for Mesta members that this trade significantly enriched the members of the Mesta. These were increasingly members of the higher nobility, who owned flocks in excess of 20,000 merino sheep, and smaller owners ceased to be involved in transhumance. The most important wool markets were held in Burgos, Medina del Campo and Segovia, but particularly Burgos.

Some Madrid streets are still part of the &quot;cañada&quot; system, and there are groups of people who occasionally drive sheep across the modern city as a reminder of their ancient rights and cultures, although these days sheep are generally transported by rail.

==Foundation==
Although the earliest surviving charter granting royal protection and grazing and other privileges to the Mesta was issued by Alfonso X of Castile in 1273, it claimed to replace four separate older documents, and it did not so much create the Mesta as assume its existence when granting it royal protection from the local taxes and restrictions it was encountering. The charters and privileges of the Mesta resemble those of mediaeval merchant guild, but it was actually a protective association, facilitating the business of the sheep and other livestock owners without engaging directly in their business. It did not own any sheep or pastures, buy and sell wool or control markets, and its close association with the Spanish government gave it a status and extensive presence unmatched by any guild.

Sheep numbers in Castile and León had increased greatly in the 12th and early 13th centuries, outgrowing the available local grazing and encouraging transhumance to more distant pastures. This transhumance was a frequent cause of dispute between the shepherds and local inhabitants, and the Cortes of 1252 enacted laws regulating the number and amounts of tolls that could be levied upon the flocks moving through a district. It also allowed them to use streams and customary sheepwalks (cañadas) and prevented the enclosure of previously open pasturage, foreshadowing the privileges granted to the Mesta. During the Cortes of Burgos in 1269, the king imposed the &quot;servicio de los ganados&quot;, a tax on migratory flocks and herds, and the recognition of the Mesta in 1273 allowed Alfonso to derive a greater portion of the resources of the sheep-herding industry more efficiently.

Klein noted three possible origins for the word &quot;mesta&quot;. Firstly, it might be related to annual assemblies to dispose of strays that were called &quot;mezclados&quot;, as they were mixed with a strange flock or herd, the name ultimately deriving from the Latin , the explanation he preferred. An alternative, also based on the Latin &quot;mixta&quot; is that it refers to the common ownership of the Mesta&#x27;s animals by multiple parties. However, the animals were individually owned, not common property, and generally different owners&#x27; flocks were kept separate.

Secondly, it might be related to the &quot;amistad&quot; or amity, which Klein regarded as unconvincing.

Finally, Klein mentions the name &quot;mechta&quot;, used by Algerian nomads for their winter sheep encampments, as a possibility. There were very few references to Castilian mestas in the second half of the 13th and early 14th centuries, and these may apply to the guardian escorts of the transhumant sheep rather than any assembly of sheep owners. The Arabic &quot;meshta&quot; for a winter gathering of sheep may have been transferred to the meetings of animal owners held at that time, and later, to local sheep-owners&#x27; associations in Andalucía and to the national body, both composed of such owners.

The word &quot;mestengo&quot;, (now spelled &quot;) referred to animals of uncertain ownership, literally &quot;belonging to the mesta&quot;, deriving from the name of that body. In New Spain in colonial North America, feral horses came to be known as , from which is derived the English word mustang, used for the free-roaming horses of the modern Western United States.

==Transhumance before the Mesta==
===Environmental context===
The north coast, northwest and, to a lesser extent, the southwest of Spain enjoy abundant rainfall, but the central Meseta has low rainfall, and many areas could hardly support dry arable farming in mediaeval times. Dependence solely on cereal cultivation risked periodic starvation, and livestock rearing was important in the mediaeval agricultural economy of Spain&#x27;s Christian kingdoms. Old Castile was the main cereal growing area, and it supplied its own grain needs in most years, but other parts of the Kingdom of Castile relied on Old Castile in years of shortage. The archaeological record shows that keeping pigs, sheep and goats was widespread, but numbers were limited by the lack of food in the dry summers and cold winters, and cattle were only kept in better watered areas. Small flocks of sheep and goats could be moved to summer hill pastures near settlements, but large numbers of all animals were slaughtered in late autumn. There is no clear evidence for large scale sheep transhumance of sheep flocks before the late mediaeval period.

In the early mediaeval period, as the Christian Kingdom of Castile and León expanded from their original northern territories, relatively well-watered and with good soils, to the interior plains of the Meseta Central, where scarce rainfall and poor soils made cereal agriculture difficult. In the Muslim-controlled areas, water management, irrigation, and the introduction of drought resistant and more productive crop varieties overcame the water shortages, but these techniques were not adopted in the Christian territories until they had conquered areas where they were used.

===Before 1085===
It has been claimed that, during the medieval Reconquest, the frontier lands between Christian and Muslim areas were sparsely populated, largely uncultivated and used mainly for animal grazing, and that the periodic movement of this frontier zone encouraged transhumance. However, the Christian advance into the Duero valley was undertaken by peasant mixed-farmers, who densely settled it, combining cereal crops with small livestock holdings. Only when the Reconquest progressed beyond Old Castile and entered areas of poor soils where it was difficult to grow cereals or to maintain high livestock densities did the poor quality of the land and the limited availability of grazing favour sheep transhumance over sedentary mixed farming. Transhumance existed in other Mediterranean countries with climates and grazing that favoured transhumance which were similar to central Spain, but which were not unsettled as Spain was during the Reconquest.
In the Christian lands north of the Sierra de Guadarrama, the usual livestock until the end of eleventh century were plough oxen, milk cows and pigs as well as sheep There is no evidence for large flocks of sheep before the early 1100s, and no clear evidence for any large scale transhumance of sheep flocks before the late Mediaeval period. The long-distance transhumance described from southern France, Italy and Spain was connected with the commercial exploitation of sheep, mainly for wool, and its taxation by the local states, and was not connected with subsistence farming.
Sheep were relatively unimportant in the Islamic Caliphate of Córdoba and there is no known record of long-distance transhumance before its fall in the 1030s. The Marinids, a Zenata Berber group which held extensive sheep flocks in Morocco, intervened in Andalusia several times in the late 13th and early 14th centuries in support of the Emirate of Granada, and they may have brought new breeds of sheep and the practice of long-distance transhumance, including the use of Berber and Arabic terms, into Spain. However, there is no definite evidence that the Marinids did bring their flocks to Spain and they arrived as a fighting force, conducting frequent raids against the Castilians, and were hardly in a position to protect any flocks they might have brought. It is more probable that Moroccan rams were imported, to crossbreed with the native stock.

===After 1085===
The captures by Castile of Toledo in 1085 and of Zaragoza by the Kingdom of Aragon in 1118 greatly increased the sizes of these Christian kingdoms and, particularly for Aragon, their populations. However, the increase in Castile&#x27;s population was not commensurate with its increased size. Much of the Muslim population of the southern territories, renamed New Castile, left for North Africa or the Emirate of Granada, and the increasing use of the heavy plough in the north of the kingdom raised cereal production and discouraged its population from southward migration into areas less suitable for mixed farming.
In the 12th and 13th centuries, many sheep-herders in Old Castile and León began transhumance to more distant pastures, within or without those provinces, This was both of the &quot;normal&quot; variety, moving from the home farm to summer pastures within the same province, and an &quot;inverse&quot; movement to winter pastures further away. Two examples of normal transhumance are first, when many Castilian cities and towns were granted royal charters in the 12th century, they gained control over large areas of upland pasturage and granted grazing rights to their citizens. and, second, after the Aragónese conquest of the Ebro valley in the first quarter of the 12th century, sheep wintering in the valley were granted rights by the king to summer pasture in the foothills of the Pyrenees.

===The monasteries and military orders ===
Until the 10th century, much of the land in Old Castile and León was in the collective ownership of peasants carrying on mixed subsistence farming including small-scale, local livestock activity. However, by the 14th and 15th centuries, most of such communities had become dependent, first on monasteries, later on lay lords and finally on neighbouring cities and large towns whose councils were controlled by oligarchies. The early part of this process social and economic differentiation in the 11th to 13th centuries coincided with, and probably promoted, the rise of large-scale transhumance. In the 10th and 11th centuries, several large Benedictine monasteries founded in the Duero valley began medium-range transhumance and gained royal privileges of pasturage on the slopes of the Sierra de Guadarrama.
The Castilian expansion of the 12th century was based substantially on the civic militias of Old Castile, but in the 13th century the forces of the military orders based in the south of New Castile were more important. The orders, particularly those of Santiago and Calatrava were granted extensive rights to land in this territory. The military orders settled few peasant cultivators in their lands, although peasants grew some grain close to the towns, and many Muslim inhabitants left.
At the start of the 12th century, the raising of livestock, preferably sheep, centred around pasture rights granted to clerics, initially those around the slopes of the Sierra de Guadarrama but later they began &quot;inverse transhumance&quot; to the pastures of the Sierra Morena. It was the flocks of the monasteries that first opened up the cañadas in New Castile, but these were soon followed by the military orders, and later by secular flocks, among the first being those from Burgos in the last decades of the 12th century. By the late 12th century, the military Orders were regularly driving flocks of sheep from New Castile into the previously Muslim areas of La Mancha and western Murcia, and even into areas still under Muslim control before the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa.

===The towns ===
The kings of Castile from Alfonso VIII to Ferdinand III protected the rights of the monasteries and military orders to move their sheep to graze in the south of their kingdom, but Alfonso X realised that granting similar transhumant rights to the cities and towns of Old Castile and León would create a significant new source of income. The conquest of the Guadalquivir valley in the 13th century permitted flocks from the Duero and Tagus basins to over-winter there, extending the length of transhumance journeys and the number of sheep that could be fed through the winter.

==Operation of the Mesta==

===Organisation===
The Mesta&#x27;s original charter of 1273 was supplemented in 1276 and renewed in 1347 and 1371. Its internal organisation was originally governed by regulations of 1379, which have been lost. However, ordinances of 1492, supplemented by a code of 1511, regulated its operations for most of its existence. It was organised into four geographical units () (&quot;cuadrillas&quot; in modern Spanish) based around the principal pastoral cities of the northern meseta, Soria, Segovia, Cuenca and León, where most of the flocks of Merino sheep had their home pastures. Its governing council consisted a president who was, after 1500, always chosen from the members of the Royal Council, and the leaders of each of the four quadrillas. The office of president was so powerful that, when the reformer Pedro Rodríguez, Count of Campomanes was appointed to this post in 1779 to eliminate the organisation&#x27;s abuses, he went far towards dismantling the Mesta&#x27;s organisation by promoting agriculture in the Sierra Morena, one of its principal winter pasturelands, despite opposition from Mesta members.

The most important administrative officials of the Mesta were the &quot;alcaldes de quadrilla&quot; (also called alcaldes de mesta, two elected by each quadrilla, who were entrusted with the general administration of the laws relating to its members. There were also financial and legal officials who represented members in arranging leases and in disputes with third-parties.

The assemblies of the Mesta were open to anyone who paid its membership dues, which were based in the number of sheep each owned, and no minimum ownership was required. However, it was estimated that only around one-tenth of its membership attended these assemblies. Although every member present had a single vote, nobles and substantial owners had the greatest influence and were often able to direct proceedings. Initially, the Mesta held three assemblies a year, but from 1500 this was reduced to two, one in the southern pasturelands in January or February, and the other in one of the four northern quadrilla centres in September or October. These assemblies dealt with the organisation of the next transhumance and the election of Mesta officials, and proposals were first voted on by each quadrilla, then in a general assembly, where each quadrilla had a single vote. In the 18th century, meetings were often reduced to one a year, always held in Madrid.

Although great nobles and major monasteries are frequently recorded as Mesta member, these large owners were not typical of the industry. The limited available evidence from the 16th century suggests there were between 3,000 and 4,000 owners, that two-thirds of the sheep migrating annually were held in flocks of less than 100 sheep and that very few flocks exceeded 1,000 sheep. Although by the 18th century, there were fewer small owners and several owners held flocks of more than 20,000 sheep, the Mesta remained largely an organisation of owners of small to moderately-sized flocks, and never simply a combination of large owners. However, it is also clear that, in the Mesta&#x27;s final century of existence, many of the owners of small flocks had to abandon the annual migration, unless they were employed by large owners as shepherds, because their small flocks were no longer allowed to be grouped into larger units, as had been the case in earlier centuries.

===The annual migrations===
There is little information on the annual migrations in the first century of the Mesta&#x27;s charter, although as northern flocks were supplying the meat markets of Toledo then, this suggests that producing wool was not yet their predominant purpose. There is also nothing about how the migrations were carried out in practice in the Mesta ordinances of 1492 or its code of 1511, and only occasional documentary evidence about this from legal proceedings dating from the 16th to 18th centuries, which discuss the customary practices governing this migration. However, from the 16th century, if not earlier, the pastoral transhumant cycle, involving the dates of the two migrations, the length of daily marches and frequency of rests, and the times for lambing and shearing, was designed to ensure the best conditions for the feeding, growth and reproduction of Merino sheep. The availability of fresh grass throughout the year resulted in the increased fineness of their fleeces, and it was realised that transhumance was essential to create wool of a quality that sedentary sheep flocks could not match. This circumstance was used to justify the Mesta&#x27;s privileges.

The Mesta records indicate that, from 1436 to 1549, in excess of 2.5 million sheep took part in the annual migration. This number declined during the remainder of the 16th century, and more steeply in the early 17th century to a low point of some 1.6 million sheep in 1603 to 1633, climbing slowly for the rest of the century then more rapidly from the start of the 18th century to a maximum of around 5 million transhumant sheep a year for 1790 to 1795, before a catastrophic decline following the French invasion of 1808 and the Peninsular War. In 1832, in one of the final years of the Mesta&#x27;s existence, it was responsible for 1.1 million transhumant merino sheep, 2.0 million other fine wool sheep that were not transhumant and 4.9 million other sheep that were not transhumant and which produced only low-grade wool.

The most complete account of the organisation of the migrations, given by a shepherd, was recorded in 1828, in the organisation&#x27;s last decade. By the 18th century, the shortage of pasture made it essential for the sheep owners to have grazing leases in advance, to avoid arbitrary price rises by landowners. They therefore relied on having a salaried &quot;Mayoral&quot; or chief shepherd with sufficient power and experience to negotiate pasture leases for all the sheep in his flock, termed his &quot;cabaña&quot;: their role in earlier years may have been less prominent than in the 1828 account. Some mayorales were guilty of fraud, agreeing to unreasonably high pasture rents with landowners and receiving a share of the excess. However, it was only by the institution of , associations of owners which rented grazing and employed shepherds collectively, that owners could secure access to grazing lands. Despite Mesta regulations, the competed with one another for the best grazing, and the most affluent groups monopolised this to the exclusion of poorer ones.

Most of the Merino flocks from the late 15th century on had their home pastures in León, Old Castile and north-eastern La Mancha, an area divided between the four quadrillas of León, Segovia, Soria and Cuenca, each of which dealt with a section of the annual transhumance. Flocks from León and Old Castile traveled between 550 and 750 kilometres to their winter pastures, while those from New Castile and La Mancha rarely travelled more than 250 kilometres. All these usually completed their migration south in a month or less, reaching their winter pastures in October, and they usually began their returned north in April and May.

The preparations for the journey south began in mid-September, when each owner&#x27;s cabaña, which was branded with his marks, was placed in the hands of an experienced mayoral, who had to be experienced both in managing sheep and choosing good grazing. Larger cabañas were kept together on the march, but divided into smaller units termed &quot;rebaños&quot; of about 1,000 sheep managed a shepherd with several assistants and sheepdogs. The shepherds were normally engaged for a year ending in June when the flocks were returned to their home pastures, and usually paid mainly in kind, with grain, a proportion of lambs born and cheese produced, but not in wool, and with a cash fee for each 100 sheep herded. In earlier centuries, smaller flocks called &quot;hatos&quot; were grouped to form a rebaño, but this practice ceased in the 18th century as smaller owners gradually ceased to engage in transhumance or were forced out by the difficulties of securing grazing. In the early centuries of the Mesta&#x27;s existence, owners of flocks were obliged to defend their stock against possible attacks by Muslim raiders or armed robbers, either in person or by making a payment, but this requirement ceased in the 16th century.

On arrival in the winter pastures, the shepherds inspected whether the pasture lands they had previously leased were adequate. Despite being granted, in theory at least, free access to southern pastures by royal charter, from the middle of the 16th century few stockholders came south without first arranging suitable pasturage, otherwise they had to pay excessive rents for any remaining low-quality grazing, often in the hills. The rebaños were divided between a number of pens built for shelter and for lambing, which took place in the winter pastures. Any old and infertile rams and diseased and weak ewes were culled soon after arrival to protect the quality of the wool, and of weak lambs were culled shortly after birth.

The lambs were ready to travel north in the following spring, and the flocks left the southern plains from mid-April. Their wool was shorn on their way north, and was then washed, and taken to one of the Mesta warehouses, the largest being in Segovia. The wool was later sent the fairs, especially Medina del Campo, or to the northern ports for shipment to Flanders and England. After the shearing, the journey north then resumed at a slower pace, and the last flocks reached their home pastures in May or early June. They would then be moved to their summer pastures in the hills, often hungry and weak after the long journey north.

===The Cañadas===
The annual migration was made possible by using &quot;cañadas&quot; a system of long-distance pathways used by migrating flocks which occur in those Mediterranean countries that practice transhumance. In Spain, some of the paths that run north–south are known to have existed from the early Middle Ages, although claims of Roman or pre-Roman origin are doubtful, as the ancient sheepwalks that have been described from Spain are generally relatively short and frequently run from uplands east to the Mediterranean coast, rather than from north to south. Sheep were generally only part of the mixed farming of cereals and livestock in León and Old Castile before the 12th century, less important than pigs and rarely moved outside their local area. The cañadas in León and Old Castile may have developed from an increased range of transhumance that first occurred within those provinces, and which were extended south as the northern boundaries of Muslim states retreated.

The expansion of the cañadas southward has been related to three causes, which may have all played their part, but here is no evidence of large scale transhumance in Extremadura, Andalucía and La Mancha when they were under Muslim rule, so the impetus must have come from the Christian north. From the reconquest of Toledo in 1085 to that of Andalucía, stock raising, particularly of sheep, was developed New Castile, at first by over thirty northern monasteries, bishoprics and churches, many with their summer pastures in the Sierra de Guadarrama, and secondly by the military orders, which received royal grants of pasturelands in the Tagus valley. Documents dated from the late 12th century show that the military Orders were regularly driving their sheep from New Castile into the previously Muslim areas of La Mancha, western Murcia and into the Guadalquivir valley, and it is possible that this transhumance had crossed political boundaries between Christian and Muslim states the before local Christian reconquest.

The third possible cause relates to transhumance organised by the towns of Castile and León. Southern towns, such as Toledo after its 1085 reconquest, sent their flocks to over-winter in the Guadalquivir valley, accompanied by an armed guard. In addition, there was an expansion of transhumant travel south from Segovia and Burgos at the end of the 12th century and the start of the 13th century using cañadas opened by the monasteries, possibly into what was still Muslim territory. However, the victory of Los Navas de Tolosa in 1212 opened the pastures of the Guadiana to all Castilian flocks, not just those of the monasteries and military orders. As the influence of the Castilian urban stockholders increased from the last decades of the 12th century, they increased the numbers of the sheep they were able to support by exploiting these new pastures.

The main north–south cañadas, or &quot;Cañadas Reales&quot;, were those designated by royal charter, although their precise routes may have changed over time, as they were only marked and given a defined width when crossing cultivated land, not when crossing open or untilled land. Both near their north and south termini, numerous minor local cañadas joined into or branched off from the Cañadas Reales. Klein describes three principal groups of cañadas reales wholly within the kingdom of Castile-León, namely the western, or &quot;Leonesa&quot;, the central, or &quot;Segoviana&quot;, and the eastern, or &quot;Manchega&quot; groups, running through the cities of León, Segovia and Cuenca respectively. Walker splits the Segovian group, adding a fourth group passing through Soria. The Leonese cañadas terminated in Extremadura and in the banks of the Tagus and Guadiana rivers, those of Segovia and Soria, which were the major routes, ended in Andalucía and the Manchegan ones in La Mancha and eastern Murcia. Some authors divide these groups into nine or ten quite separate routes, but Klein noted the possibility of sheep moving between different branches of the western and central groups.

There are very few records of numbers of sheep migrating annually before the early 16th century. In the 16th century, the numbers of migrating sheep recorded annually ranged from 1.7 to 3.5 million, averaging around 2.5 million Merino sheep, but the numbers began to decline in the late 16th and particularly in the early 17th century, a time of warfare in the Low Countries. Klein places the start of the Mesta&#x27;s decadence in the third quarter of the 16th century. During that period, only Merino sheep migrated, but the proportion of Merinos driven south in any year depended on the spring rainfall in the northern pastures and the fluctuating price of pasture in the south. After the Eighty Years&#x27; War, transhumant numbers rose again, but to a lower level than in the 16th century. This was not because of a decline in overall numbers of Merino sheep, but a reduction in long-range transhumance and a parallel increase in flocks pastured in their home areas. Non- migratory Merino flocks of southern cities such as Córdoba also expanded and competed with transhumant flocks.

===The right of &quot;posesión&quot;===
Perhaps the most controversial of the Mesta&#x27;s privileges was the right of &quot;posesión&quot;, which established the Mesta&#x27;s perpetual title to tenancy for all pasturess leased by its members. Its origin lay in the Mesta&#x27;s code for its own internal administration, dated 1492. One clause attempted to prevent competition among the sheep owners for winter pasturage through an arrangement for the joint bargaining for pasture leases by lessees acting for the Mesta. Each of the four quadrillas selected a representative annually, to proceed to Extremadura and Andalucía before the annual migration and arrange the terms of grazing leases for the coming winter season. Each member was only assigned sufficient land for his flocks, and each landowner was to be treated equally. The aim was to prevent competition between Mesta members or joint action by the landowning lessors to raise rents.

The 1492 ordinance was an internal Mesta measure only, but a significant action taken by Ferdinand and Isabella in January 1501 in support of the Mesta was to create a law of posesión, which granted Mesta members the permanent tenancy of a stated pasture field, either at the rental paid under their earliest lease, or if a flocks occupied such fields for a season unchallenged or undiscovered by the landowner, for no payment. The probable intention was to prevent competition for grazing among Mesta members, by guaranteeing the earliest flocks to arrive were given priority for leases. However, the Mesta was able to have an interpretation of the rule of posesión accepted by the courts that was more favourable to its interests, arguing that, as its charter allowed it to represent all sheep owners, it had the right negotiate and allocate all pasturage leases in Castile to prevent disputes or competition between its members.

Although this interpretation was disputed by the landowners of southern Castile, including towns, ecclesiastics, military orders and private individuals, it was upheld by the courts and confirmed in a series of laws passed in 1505. One interpretation, based on the assumption that the privilege of posesión operated strictly in accordance with these laws and could be enforced, was that it retarded the growth of agriculture and had a negative effect on Spain&#x27;s political development for centuries, a view that ignores the active and passive resistance to this legislation. An alternative view is that the right of posesión was a form of rent control that guaranteed shepherd access to the pastures at stable prices.

The Habsburg monarchs were inconsistent in granting exemptions from the Mesta&#x27;s privileges, including posesión, in return for payment. However, in 1633, after a sharp downturn in wool sales and the related tax revenue, the rules of posesión were renewed, and pastures converted to arable were ordered to be restored to pasturage. It has been suggested that a weak monarchy and strong local resistance reduced the effect of this measure, but a survey of sheep owners in the province of Soria indicates that far more of them included rights of posesión in their wills in the 17th century, regarding these rights as part of their patrimony, than did so in the 16th century, and that such rights were exchanged between such owners. Although posesión gave rise to frequent legal disputes, these demonstrate an increase in the practice as much as opposition to it.

The first two Spanish Bourbon kings, under the influence of the doctrines of mercantilism current in France, renewed Mesta privileges in 1726 and extended the law of posesión to Aragon. Their action was more successful than the 1633 renewal, as appeals in pasture disputes were moved to a court more favourable to the Mesta. In contrast to his predecessors, Charles III and his reforming ministers regarded posesión as a mediaeval survival that had outlived its usefulness and considered that its continuation inhibited a necessary growth in cereal cultivation. This led, firstly to a restriction of the right of posesión in 1761, and then its complete abolition in 1786.

===Conflicts involving transhumance===
Cereal growing inevitably competed with sheep rearing, and the movement of flocks from the Old Castile to Andalucía created conflict between shepherds and the farmers cultivating crops along migration routes, as well as those local owners of sheep in areas of winter pasture. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the widespread introduction of the heavy plough in Old Castile led to increased cereal production and led to the abandonment of marginal cultivation, creating more pasture. The emigration of much of the Muslim population from New Castile to Granada and North Africa also led to the abandonment of areas of dry farming there. These changes favoured stock-raising, and there was probably enough land for both pasture and arable farming at first.

Laws confirming the Mesta&#x27;s rights and tax privileges were issued seven times in the 14th century. However the frequency with which legislation was restated under relatively strong monarchs, and the absence of confirmatory legislation under weak ones, particularly for much of the 15th century, showed how extensive was resistance to the Mesta&#x27;s privileges, as it required the Crown&#x27;s support to enforce obedience to the laws protecting its members. There is ample evidence from this period of disputes over unauthorised tolls and encroachment on the cañadas, and ploughing of pastures which might only be used for a few months a year. In theory, the Mesta had the right of pasturage and transit over all land except that in use for growing cereals, vineyards, orchards, hay meadows producing winter feed for cattle and land reserved for deer, but these mediaeval privileges had ceased to exist in reality by the end of the 15th century, largely because the frequency of encroachments on pasturelands and the numbers of unjustified tolls swamped the courts with far more cases than they could deal with adequately.

Itinerant judicial officials, each termed an &quot;Entregador&quot;, were tasked with keeping open the cañadas and their watering and resting stations, resisting encroachments on public pastures and protecting the shepherds. Initially one such official patrolled each of the four main cañada systems, but their numbers were increased to six in the late 15th century, then later reduced to only three in 1650. They were initially appointed by the Crown to protect the interests of the Mesta and adjudicate in disputes it had with towns and the landowners along the transhumant routes. In 1568, the Entregadors became officers of the Mesta, and lost the prestige of being royal officials.

Flocks migrating south required stops for rest, feeding and watering om route and were vulnerable to excessive charges there, and to excessive rents charged at their destinations by owners of winter pastures. The shepherds had little alternative to paying or risking heavy livestock losses. The military orders also opposed the attempts of northern pastoralists to use winter grazing in their territories. The strong monarchy of the late 15th and 16th centuries, which supported the export of merino wool, was better able to protect the members of the Mesta and the emergence of the right of &quot;posesión&quot; in the 16th century, attempted to control these charges and rents and guarantee shepherds access to the pastures at fixed prices, although there was increasing pressure for new arable farmland to be brought into use in the 18th century.

Under the later Habsburg monarchs, there was increasing resistance to the passage of transhumant flocks. This led to the decline in smaller owners being involved in transhumance and the dominance of the Mesta by those with very large flocks, who had the money to pay for grazing along migration routes and the political influence to enforce their rights. The towns en route either tried to dissuade or divert transhumant flocks from their territory, or to extract as much as they could by leasing their pastures for flocks on their way to and from the south. Although, in theory, the Mesta&#x27;s legal rights were clear and the association had an impressive apparatus to enforce them, these rights were breached when routes of the cañadas were moved away to fertile pastures or restricted to below their legal width, and illegal dues were imposed. Even where the Mesta&#x27;s right were restored after lengthy court proceedings, those that had infringed them usually received no financial or other penalty. Both summer and winter pastures used by transhumant sheep were supposed to remain unploughed and unsown, as was reconfirmed by a royal decree of 1748. In the 18th century, this uncultivated land came under great pressure as the numbers of transhumant sheep doubled, but rents for pasture were fixed and the land could not be used for crops.

During the 17th century, the powers and incomes of the Entregadors were steadily eroded by the courts, and the government granted exemptions from the Entregadors&#x27; jurisdiction to towns willing to pay for them and, by the end of that century they were virtually powerless against the courts and exempted towns, although the office remained in existence for another century. By the start of the 18th century, local officials had taken over control of their towns’ grazing grounds, and had enclosing them on the basis that they were so covered with undergrowth as to be useless as pasturage, whether or mot this was accurate. By this time, the Mesta had suffered severely from the general economic decay of the 17th century, and its weakened Entregadors could no longer successfully oppose these local interests.

==Evolution of the Mesta 16th to 18th centuries==
Klein regarded the reign of Ferdinand and Isabela as the golden age of the Mesta, as their aggressive promotion of wool exports, reform of local taxes and dues, ensuring that the collection of what should have been royal taxes on sheep were collected only by royal agents, efficiently and at much lower rates than under the Hapsburg kings, and extending and enforcing pasture privileges for transhumant flocks and enforcing these put the members of the Mesta in a more favourable position than they had under later monarchs. The Emperor Charles V greatly increased taxes on wool production and impose forced loans in the Mesta to fund his ambitions outside Spain, and Klein argued that the wool trade started to decline from the 1560s, when Philip II further increased export taxes on it, and that the Mesta never fully revived.

However, the fortunes of the Mesta fluctuated throughout its existence rather than steadily declining from the late 16th century, particularly as the importance of its non-transhumant flocks increased after the mid-17th century. The Mesta did undergo a crisis in the early-to-mid 17th century, a time of warfare in northern Europe and a consequent European economic crisis, which caused a disruption in the wool trade and increase in the cost of grazing that made transhumance unprofitable and led to a reduction in the numbers of transhumant sheep, but it recovered.

The Mesta originated, firstly, because the dry climate of the central Meseta and the sparse population of areas conquered from the Muslims between the 11th and 13th centuries made the transhumant raising of sheep the most efficient use of its land. The continuation of its activities in the 15th and 16th centuries depended on the introduction of the Merino breed, whose fine wool supported the growth of the Italian wool textile industry and allowed that of the Low Counties to overcome the decline in English wool exports. Even though the Andalusian plains that could have supported intensive wheat cultivation, the need for winter pastures and their relatively low population before the 18th century prevented this development.

Secondly, the Mesta was an important source of royal income from the 13th century. Alfonso X wished to tax the transhumant flocks and their wool, and his charter of 1273 reserved certain taxes for the Crown and limited the levies that others could charge. Although Castile had an impressive and all-encompassing tax system in theory, in practice the Crown was largely dependent on a sales tax, and much of what the Crown actually received in the 16th and 17th centuries was collected by the Mesta on wool exports. The king received little of whatever other tax revenues were collected, as these were retained by the cities or nobles. The royal sheep taxes became a critical source of income under the Habsburgs and early Bourbons, and these taxes and forced loans imposed on the Mesta made its continuation essential to the Spanish exchequer.

As long as transhumant sheep continued to produce merino wool and the tax on wool exports continued to be a major source of royal income, the Mesta could continue. Warfare within Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession and the Peninsular War disrupted the annual migrations and, the latter particularly, devastated many flocks. External European conflicts such as the Eighty Years&#x27; War could also hinder exports of wool. Although the numbers of sheep controlled by the Mesta recovered after each conflict, the recovery after the Peninsular War was only partial.

===18th century recovery=== 
After a period of virtual bankruptcy in the late 17th century, when the weak government of Charles II was detrimental to the Mesta, a recovery under the first two Bourbon monarchs reversed this trend, particularly after the War of the Spanish Succession ended, largely because the government enforced the Mesta&#x27;s privileges with greater rigour. The numbers of transhumant sheep doubled between 1708 and 1780 to reach an historical peak around 1780, assisted by the royal decree of 1748, which confirmed that both summer and winter pastures must remain unploughed and unsown, unless royal permission for ploughing was granted.

In the 18th century, as legislation controlling the price of pastures became more effectively enforced, the volume of wool exports increased. This was assisted by a decline in the Spanish population in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, which reduced the cultivation of grain. Increased prices for wool exports and the prohibition on returning pastures to arable prevented a growth in cultivation until pressure from reformers after the accession of Charles III forced through agrarian reforms. However, there is no evidence of the failure of the Mesta&#x27;s institutions before the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.

==Decline of the Mesta==
The late 18th century attack on the Mesta was undertaken followers of the Enlightenment in Spain with support from Charles III. They considered that the benefit of fine wool exports was outweighed by its damage to agriculture, but based their views more on the success of the Agricultural Revolution that was taking place in different conditions in northern Europe than on actual conditions in Spain. However, instead of proposing a balance between agriculture and pastoralism, they promoted cultivation exclusively, claiming that even the driest lands with the thinnest soils could be made profitable for agriculture with the appropriate combination of seeds, cultivation techniques and manure, underestimating the actual benefit of transhumant sheep in manuring areas along their routes.
Pressure from would-be cultivators, in the face of Mesta opposition, enabled wheat to be grown on former pastures in the Andalusian plains, despite an immediate loss of royal income from wool taxes. These early reforming impulses of Charles III had no immediate effect on the Mesta&#x27;s prosperity, which reached its highest monetary level between 1763 and 1785, although the rising price of cereals in this period and the start of a decline in wool prices suggested this prosperity was fragile.

Charles III had little interest in supporting the Mesta, and he allowed its freedom of transit to be abused by towns and landowners. His actions and inaction in the last two decades of the 18th century, made regular transhumance increasingly difficult and pushed the Mesta into a terminal decline. The social and commercial reforms of Charles and Campomanes included a significant reduction in Mesta pasture rights by granting towns the freedom to use their common lands as they wished in 1761, and giving local sedentary flocks preference to over transhumant ones for Extremaduran pasturage in 1783. These measures began to have an adverse effect on the Mesta in the last decades of the 18th century. However, a very cold winter in 1779-80 that killed many sheep and a critical reduction in fine wool exports caused by declining demand were also important, as they intensified the effects of reduced availability and increased costs of winter pastures in reversing its fortunes. Prices for fine wool decreased substantially between 1782 and 1799, and more dramatically between 1800 until the catastrophe of the French invasion in 1808. That invasion completely disrupted the traditional patterns of transhumance and wool production, although the regime of Joseph Bonaparte attempted to revive the latter, with limited success.
Although Merino sheep had been exported from Spain in the 18th century, the greatest effect of the loss of Spain&#x27;s virtual monopoly of producing the finest quality wools was felt in the early 19th century, when the disruption caused by the Peninsular War, which persisted for several years after the war ended, led to a decline in quantity and quality of Spanish wool produced, and allowed foreign producers of merino wool to prosper. 
In the aftermath of the Peninsular War, Ferdinand VII again ratified the Mesta&#x27;s privileges in 1816 and 1827, reversing the reforms of Charles III. This was similar to the support that Philip IV had given during the early-17th century crisis, suggesting that royal support was more secure in times of crisis for the Mesta than when its 18th century expansion made it a target for Charles III&#x27;s reforms. However, the legal situation in the early 19th century did not reflect the actual weakness of the Mesta or the strength of the opposition to it of agriculturalists and the towns. Neither could Royal support counter the growth of merino wool production in South America, Australia and South Africa, nor the competition from the wool of other breeds that approached it for fineness. After 1808, almost all the limited quantity of Spanish wool exports were of reduced quality and sold to Britain, and the numbers of transhumant sheep fell from 2.75 million in 1818 to 1.11 million in 1832. 
During the latter stages of the Peninsular War, the Cortes of Cadiz, inspired by the doctrines of liberalism, attacked the privileges of the Mesta. These were attacked again by the liberal government of the Trienio Liberal, which replaced the Mesta with a short-lived state body. Although the Mesta was reinstated in the absolutist restoration of 1823, it was weakened and tainted by its association with absolutism.

The Mesta had no place in the new social and political order introduced by the liberal government that the Regent Maria Christina had appointed in 1833. In 1835 and 1836, the Mesta lost all its private judicial powers, which were transferred to a new &quot;Associación General de Ganaderos&quot; (General Association of Herdsmen), and also its tax privileges and, on 5 November 1836, its dissolution was completed and the Mesta itself was dissolved.

<text>Jacobi symbol for various &quot;k&quot; (along top) and &quot;n&quot; (along left side). Only are shown, since due to rule (2) below any other &quot;k&quot; can be reduced modulo &quot;n&quot;. Quadratic residues are highlighted in yellow — note that no entry with a Jacobi symbol of −1 is a quadratic residue, and if &quot;k&quot; is a quadratic residue modulo a coprime &quot;n&quot;, then , but not all entries with a Jacobi symbol of 1 (see the and rows) are quadratic residues. Notice also that when either &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; is a square, all values are nonnegative.

The Jacobi symbol is a generalization of the Legendre symbol. Introduced by Jacobi in 1837, it is of theoretical interest in modular arithmetic and other branches of number theory, but its main use is in computational number theory, especially primality testing and integer factorization; these in turn are important in cryptography.

==Definition==
For any integer &quot;a&quot; and any positive odd integer &quot;n&quot;, the Jacobi symbol is defined as the product of the Legendre symbols corresponding to the prime factors of &quot;n&quot;:
:formula_1
where
:formula_2
is the prime factorization of &quot;n&quot;.

The Legendre symbol is defined for all integers &quot;a&quot; and all odd primes &quot;p&quot; by
:formula_3

Following the normal convention for the empty product, = 1.

When the lower argument is an odd prime, the Jacobi symbol is equal to the Legendre symbol.

==Table of values==

The following is a table of values of Jacobi symbol with &quot;n&quot; ≤ 59, &quot;k&quot; ≤ 30, &quot;n&quot; odd.

==Properties==

The following facts, even the reciprocity laws, are straightforward deductions from the definition of the Jacobi symbol and the corresponding properties of the Legendre symbol.

The Jacobi symbol is defined only when the upper argument (&quot;numerator&quot;) is an integer and the lower argument (&quot;denominator&quot;) is a positive odd integer.

:1. If &quot;n&quot; is (an odd) prime, then the Jacobi symbol is equal to (and written the same as) the corresponding Legendre symbol.

:2. If , then formula_4

:3. formula_5

If either the top or bottom argument is fixed, the Jacobi symbol is a completely multiplicative function in the remaining argument:

:4. formula_6

:5. formula_7

The law of quadratic reciprocity: if &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are odd positive coprime integers, then

:6. formula_8 

and its supplements

:7. formula_9, 

and formula_10

:8. formula_11

Combining properties 4 and 8 gives:

:9. formula_12

Like the Legendre symbol:

*If  = −1 then &quot;a&quot; is a quadratic nonresidue modulo &quot;n&quot;.

*If &quot;a&quot; is a quadratic residue modulo &quot;n&quot; and gcd(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) = 1, then  = 1.

But, unlike the Legendre symbol:

:If  = 1 then &quot;a&quot; may or may not be a quadratic residue modulo &quot;n&quot;.

This is because for &quot;a&quot; to be a quadratic residue modulo &quot;n&quot;, it has to be a quadratic residue modulo &quot;every&quot; prime factor of &quot;n&quot;. However, the Jacobi symbol equals one if, for example, &quot;a&quot; is a non-residue modulo exactly two of the prime factors of &quot;n&quot;. 

Although the Jacobi symbol cannot be uniformly interpreted in terms of squares and non-squares, it can be uniformly interpreted as the sign of a permutation by Zolotarev&#x27;s lemma.

The Jacobi symbol is a Dirichlet character to the modulus &quot;n&quot;.

==Calculating the Jacobi symbol==

The above formulas lead to an efficient algorithm for calculating the Jacobi symbol, analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for finding the gcd of two numbers. (This should not be surprising in light of rule 2.)

# Reduce the &quot;numerator&quot; modulo the &quot;denominator&quot; using rule 2.
# Extract any even &quot;numerator&quot; using rule 9.
# If the &quot;numerator&quot; is 1, rules 3 and 4 give a result of 1. If the &quot;numerator&quot; and &quot;denominator&quot; are not coprime, rule 3 gives a result of 0.
# Otherwise, the &quot;numerator&quot; and &quot;denominator&quot; are now odd positive coprime integers, so we can flip the symbol using rule 6, then return to step 1.

In addition to the codes below, Riesel has it in Pascal.
===Implementation in Lua===

function jacobi(n, k)
 assert(k &gt; 0 and k % 2 == 1)
 n = n % k
 t = 1
 while n ~= 0 do
 while n % 2 == 0 do
 n = n / 2
 r = k % 8
 if r == 3 or r == 5 then
 t = -t
 end
 end
 n, k = k, n
 if n % 4 == 3 and k % 4 == 3 then
 t = -t
 end
 n = n % k
 end
 if k == 1 then
 return t
 else
 return 0
 end
end
=== Implementation in C++ ===

// a/n is represented as (a,n)
int jacobi(int a, int n) {
 assert(n &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; n%2 == 1);
 // Step 1
 a = (a % n + n) % n; // Handle (a &lt; 0)
 // Step 3
 int t = 0; // XOR of bits 1 and 2 determines sign of return value
 while (a != 0) {
 // Step 2
 while (a % 4 == 0)
 a /= 4;
 if (a % 2 == 0) {
 t ^= n; // Could be &quot;^= n &amp; 6&quot;; we only care about bits 1 and 2
 a /= 2;
 // Step 4
 t ^= a &amp; n &amp; 2; // Flip sign if a % 4 == n % 4 == 3
 int r = n % a;
 n = a;
 a = r;
 if (n != 1)
 return 0;
 else if ((t ^ (t » 1)) &amp; 2)
 return -1;
 else
 return 1;


==Example of calculations==

The Legendre symbol is only defined for odd primes &quot;p&quot;. It obeys the same rules as the Jacobi symbol (i.e., reciprocity and the supplementary formulas for and and multiplicativity of the &quot;numerator&quot;.)

Problem: Given that 9907 is prime, calculate .

===Using the Legendre symbol===

:formula_13

===Using the Jacobi symbol===

:formula_14

The difference between the two calculations is that when the Legendre symbol is used the &quot;numerator&quot; has to be factored into prime powers before the symbol is flipped. This makes the calculation using the Legendre symbol significantly slower than the one using the Jacobi symbol, as there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for factoring integers. In fact, this is why Jacobi introduced the symbol.

==Primality testing==

There is another way the Jacobi and Legendre symbols differ. If the Euler&#x27;s criterion formula is used modulo a composite number, the result may or may not be the value of the Jacobi symbol, and in fact may not even be −1 or 1. For example,

:formula_15

So if it is unknown whether a number &quot;n&quot; is prime or composite, we can pick a random number &quot;a&quot;, calculate the Jacobi symbol and compare it with Euler&#x27;s formula; if they differ modulo &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;n&quot; is composite; if they have the same residue modulo &quot;n&quot; for many different values of &quot;a&quot;, then &quot;n&quot; is &quot;probably prime&quot;.

This is the basis for the probabilistic Solovay–Strassen primality test and refinements such as the Baillie–PSW primality test and the Miller–Rabin primality test.

As an indirect use, it is possible to use it as an error detection routine during the execution of the Lucas–Lehmer primality test which, even on modern computer hardware, can take weeks to complete when processing Mersenne numbers over formula_16 (the largest known Mersenne prime as of October 2024). In nominal cases, the Jacobi symbol:

formula_17

This also holds for the final residue formula_18 and hence can be used as a verification of probable validity. However, if an error occurs in the hardware, there is a 50% chance that the result will become 0 or 1 instead, and won&#x27;t change with subsequent terms of formula_19 (unless another error occurs and changes it back to -1).

<text>Benu is the first restaurant in San Francisco to have received Three Michelin Stars. Located in the SoMa district, Benu was opened in 2010 by chef Corey Lee, the former Chef de Cuisine at the French Laundry. 

In 2019, Benu made its debut on The World&#x27;s 50 Best Restaurants, and in 2024 celebrated ten consecutive years of receiving three Stars.

== Restaurant ==
Corey Lee was born in Seoul, South Korea and moved to the United States at age five. Prior to opening Benu, he was the head chef at The French Laundry, working for Thomas Keller at both The French Laundry and Per Se for a total of nine years.

At Benu, he serves a set tasting menu that features a wide variety of seafood and vegetables, a few meat courses, and some sweets. Lee draws from many different cuisines, including Korean and Cantonese. He states that “Benu is open to the influence of all different kinds of cultures. We have Asian influences, of course. We have Western influences. We have influences that are technique-driven. Some are flavor-driven. Some are ingredient-driven. But it accepts all those things and it defines the kind of food we serve.”

In addition to the tasting menu, Benu offers an optional beverage pairing that includes beer, wine, and sake.

Benu is housed on the ground floor of a historic building that dates back to 1922–originally the headquarters of the San Francisco Newspaper Company. Crown Point Press, an art studio, gallery, and bookstore, now owns the building and resides directly above the restaurant.

In 2015, Phaidon published &quot;Benu&quot;–a collection of recipes and essays that explores the restaurant&#x27;s food, influences, and collaborators–with forewords by Thomas Keller and David Chang, designed by Julia Hasting.

<text>Ḥeḥ (&quot;ḥḥ&quot;, also Huh, Hah, Hauh, Huah, and Hehu) was the personification of infinity or eternity in the Ogdoad in ancient Egyptian religion. His name originally meant &quot;flood&quot;, referring to the watery chaos Nu that the Egyptians believed existed before the creation of the world. The Egyptians envisioned this chaos as infinite, in contrast with the finite created world, so Heh personified this aspect of the primordial waters. Heh&#x27;s female counterpart and consort was known as Hauhet, which is simply the feminine form of his name.

Like the other concepts in the Ogdoad, his male form was often depicted as a frog, or a frog-headed human, and his female form as a snake or snake-headed human. The frog head symbolised fertility, creation, and regeneration, and was also possessed by the other Ogdoad males Kek, Amun, and Nun. The other common representation depicts him crouching, holding a palm stem in each hand (or just one), sometimes with a palm stem in his hair, as palm stems represented long life to the Egyptians, the years being represented by notches on it. Depictions of this form also had a shen ring at the base of each palm stem, which represented infinity. Depictions of Heh were also used in hieroglyphs to represent one million, which was essentially considered equivalent to infinity in Ancient Egyptian mathematics. Thus this deity is also known as the &quot;god of millions of years&quot;.

==Origins and mythology==
The primary meaning of the Egyptian word &quot;ḥeḥ&quot; was &quot;million&quot; or &quot;millions&quot;; a personification of this concept, Ḥeḥ, was adopted as the Egyptian god of infinity. With his female counterpart Ḥauḥet (or Ḥeḥut), Ḥeḥ represented one of the four god-goddess pairs comprising the Ogdoad, a pantheon of eight primeval deities whose worship was centred at Hermopolis Magna.
The mythology of the Ogdoad describes its eight members, Heh and Hauhet, Nu and Naunet, Amun and Amaunet, and Kuk and Kauket, coming together in the cataclysmic event that gives rise to the sun (and its deific personification, Atum).

Heh sometimes helps Shu, a god associated with air, in supporting the sky goddess Nut. In the Book of the Heavenly Cow, eight Heh gods are depicted together with Shu supporting Nut, who has taken the form of a cow.

==Forms and iconography==

The god Ḥeḥ was usually depicted anthropomorphically, as in the hieroglyphic character, as a male figure with divine beard and lappet wig. Normally kneeling (one knee raised), sometimes in a basket—the sign for &quot;all&quot;, the god typically holds in each hand a notched palm branch (palm rib). (These were employed in the temples for ceremonial time-keeping, which use explains the use of the palm branch as the hieroglyphic symbol for &quot;rnp.t&quot;, &quot;year&quot;). Occasionally, an additional palm branch is worn on the god&#x27;s head.

In Ancient Egyptian Numerology, Gods such as Heh were used to represent numbers in a decimal point system. Particularly, the number 1,000,000 is depicted in the hieroglyph of Heh, who is in his normal seated position.
==Cult and worship==
The personified, somewhat abstract god of eternity Ḥeḥ possessed no known cult centre or sanctuary; rather, his veneration revolved around symbolism and personal belief. The god&#x27;s image and its iconographic elements reflected the wish for millions of years of life or rule; as such, the figure of Ḥeḥ finds frequent representation in amulets, prestige items and royal iconography from the late Old Kingdom period onwards. Heh became associated with the King and his quest for longevity. For instance, he appears on the tomb of King Tutankhamen, in two cartouches, where he is crowned with a winged scarab beetle, symbolizing existence and a sun disk. The placement of Heh in relation to King Tutankhamen&#x27;s corpse means he will be granting him these &quot;millions of years&quot; into the afterlife.

<doc id="97317" wikidata="Q133343" url="?curid=97317" title="Hathor">
<text>Hathor (, , , Meroitic: &quot;&quot;) was a major goddess in ancient Egyptian religion who played a wide variety of roles. As a sky deity, she was the mother or consort of the sky god Horus and the sun god Ra, both of whom were connected with kingship, and thus she was the symbolic mother of their earthly representatives, the pharaohs. She was one of several goddesses who acted as the Eye of Ra, Ra&#x27;s feminine counterpart, and in this form, she had a vengeful aspect that protected him from his enemies. Her beneficent side represented music, dance, joy, love, sexuality, and maternal care, and she acted as the consort of several male deities and the mother of their sons. These two aspects of the goddess exemplified the Egyptian conception of femininity. Hathor crossed boundaries between worlds, helping deceased souls in the transition to the afterlife.

Hathor was often depicted as a cow, symbolizing her maternal and celestial aspect, although her most common form was a woman wearing a headdress of cow horns and a sun disk. She could also be represented as a lioness, a cobra, or a sycomore tree.

Cattle goddesses similar to Hathor were portrayed in Egyptian art in the fourth millennium BC, but she may not have appeared until the Old Kingdom (). With the patronage of Old Kingdom rulers, she became one of Egypt&#x27;s most important deities. More temples were dedicated to her than to any other goddess; her most prominent temple was Dendera in Upper Egypt. She was also worshipped in the temples of her male consorts. The Egyptians connected her with foreign lands, such as Nubia and Canaan, and their valuable goods, such as incense and semiprecious stones, and some of the peoples in those lands adopted her worship. In Egypt, she was one of the deities commonly invoked in private prayers and votive offerings, particularly by women desiring children.

During the New Kingdom (), goddesses such as Mut and Isis encroached on Hathor&#x27;s position in royal ideology, but she remained one of the most widely worshipped deities. After the end of the New Kingdom, Hathor was increasingly overshadowed by Isis, but she continued to be venerated until the extinction of ancient Egyptian religion in the early centuries AD.

==Origins==

Images of cattle appear frequently in the artwork of Predynastic Egypt (before ), as do images of women with upraised, curved arms, reminiscent of the shape of bovine horns. Both types of imagery may represent goddesses connected with cattle. Cows are venerated in many cultures, including ancient Egypt, as symbols of motherhood and nourishment, because they care for their calves and provide humans with milk. The Gerzeh Palette, a stone palette from the Naqada II period of prehistory (), shows the silhouette of a cow&#x27;s head with inward-curving horns surrounded by stars. The palette suggests that this cow was also linked with the sky, as were several goddesses from later times who were represented in this form: Hathor, Mehet-Weret, and Nut.

Despite these earlier precedents, Hathor is not unambiguously mentioned or depicted until the Fourth Dynasty () of the Old Kingdom, although several artifacts that refer to her may date to the Early Dynastic Period (). When Hathor does clearly appear, her horns curve outward, rather than inward like those in Predynastic art.

A bovine deity with inward-curving horns appears on the Narmer Palette from near the start of Egyptian history, both atop the palette and on the belt or apron of the king, Narmer. The Egyptologist Henry George Fischer suggested this deity may be Bat, a goddess who was later depicted with a woman&#x27;s face and inward-curling horns, seemingly reflecting the curve of the cow horns. The Egyptologist Lana Troy, however, identifies a passage in the Pyramid Texts from the late Old Kingdom that connects Hathor with the &quot;apron&quot; of the king, reminiscent of the goddess on Narmer&#x27;s garments, and suggests the goddess on the Narmer Palette is Hathor rather than Bat.

In the Fourth Dynasty, Hathor rose rapidly to prominence. She supplanted an early crocodile god who was worshipped at Dendera in Upper Egypt to become Dendera&#x27;s patron deity, and she increasingly absorbed the cult of Bat in the neighboring region of Hu, so that in the Middle Kingdom () the two deities fused into one. The theology surrounding the pharaoh in the Old Kingdom, unlike that of earlier times, focused heavily on the sun god Ra as king of the gods and father and patron of the earthly king. Hathor ascended with Ra and became his mythological wife, and thus divine mother of the pharaoh.

==Roles==

Hathor took many forms and appeared in a wide variety of roles. The Egyptologist Robyn Gillam suggests that these diverse forms emerged when the royal goddess promoted by the Old Kingdom court subsumed many local goddesses worshipped by the general populace, who were then treated as manifestations of her. Egyptian texts often speak of the manifestations of the goddess as &quot;Seven Hathors&quot; or, less commonly, of many more Hathors—as many as 362. For these reasons, Gillam calls her &quot;a type of deity rather than a single entity&quot;. Hathor&#x27;s diversity reflects the range of traits that the Egyptians associated with goddesses. More than any other deity, she exemplifies the Egyptian perception of femininity.

===Sky goddess===

Hathor was given the epithets &quot;mistress of the sky&quot; and &quot;mistress of the stars&quot;, and was said to dwell in the sky with Ra and other sun deities. Egyptians thought of the sky as a body of water through which the sun god sailed, and they connected it with the waters from which, according to their creation myths, the sun emerged at the beginning of time. This cosmic mother goddess was often represented as a cow. Hathor and Mehet-Weret were both thought of as the cow who birthed the sun god and placed him between her horns. Like Nut, Hathor was said to give birth to the sun god each dawn.

Hathor&#x27;s Egyptian name was &quot;ḥwt-ḥrw&quot; or &quot;ḥwt-ḥr&quot;. It is typically translated &quot;house of Horus&quot; but can also be rendered as &quot;my house is the sky&quot;. The falcon god Horus represented, among other things, the sun and sky. The &quot;house&quot; referred to may be the sky in which Horus lives, or the goddess&#x27;s womb from which he, as a sun god, is born each day.

===Solar goddess===

Hathor was a solar deity, a feminine counterpart to sun gods such as Horus and Ra, and was a member of the divine entourage that accompanied Ra as he sailed through the sky in his barque. She was commonly called the &quot;Golden One&quot;, referring to the radiance of the sun, and texts from her temple at Dendera say &quot;her rays illuminate the whole earth.&quot; She was sometimes fused with another goddess, Nebethetepet, whose name can mean &quot;Lady of the Offering&quot;, &quot;Lady of Contentment&quot;, or &quot;Lady of the Vulva&quot;. At Ra&#x27;s cult center of Heliopolis, Hathor-Nebethetepet was worshipped as his consort, and the Egyptologist Rudolf Anthes argued that Hathor&#x27;s name referred to a mythical &quot;house of Horus&quot; at Heliopolis that was connected with the ideology of kingship.

She was one of many goddesses to take the role of the Eye of Ra, a feminine personification of the disk of the sun and an extension of Ra&#x27;s own power. Ra was sometimes portrayed inside the disk, which Troy interprets as meaning that the eye goddess was thought of as a womb, from which the sun god was born. Hathor&#x27;s seemingly contradictory roles as mother, wife, and daughter of Ra reflected the daily cycle of the sun. At sunset the god entered the body of the sky goddess, impregnating her and fathering the deities born from her womb at sunrise: himself and the eye goddess, who would later give birth to him. Ra gave rise to his daughter, the eye goddess, who in turn gave rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.

The Eye of Ra protected the sun god from his enemies and was often represented as a uraeus, or rearing cobra, or as a lioness. A form of the Eye of Ra known as &quot;Hathor of the Four Faces&quot;, represented by a set of four cobras, was said to face in each of the cardinal directions to watch for threats to the sun god. A group of myths, known from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC) onward, describe what happens when the Eye goddess rampages uncontrolled. In the funerary text known as the &quot;Book of the Heavenly Cow&quot;, Ra sends Hathor as the Eye of Ra to punish humans for plotting rebellion against his rule. She becomes the lioness goddess Sekhmet and massacres the rebellious humans, but Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state reverts to being the benign and beautiful Hathor. Related to this story is the myth of the Distant Goddess, from the Late and Ptolemaic periods. The Eye goddess, sometimes in the form of Hathor, rebels against Ra&#x27;s control and rampages freely in a foreign land: Libya west of Egypt or Nubia to the south. Weakened by the loss of his Eye, Ra sends another god, such as Thoth, to bring her back to him. Once pacified, the goddess returns to become the consort of the sun god or of the god who brings her back. The two aspects of the Eye goddess—violent and dangerous versus beautiful and joyful—reflected the Egyptian belief that women, as the Egyptologist Carolyn Graves-Brown puts it, &quot;encompassed both extreme passions of fury and love&quot;.

===Music, dance, and joy===

Egyptian religion celebrated the sensory pleasures of life, believed to be among the gods&#x27; gifts to humanity. Egyptians ate, drank, danced, and played music at their religious festivals. They perfumed the air with flowers and incense. Many of Hathor&#x27;s epithets link her to celebration; she is called the mistress of music, dance, garlands, myrrh, and drunkenness. In hymns and temple reliefs, musicians play tambourines, harps, lyres, and sistra in Hathor&#x27;s honor. The sistrum, a rattle-like instrument, was particularly important in Hathor&#x27;s worship. Sistra had erotic connotations and, by extension, alluded to the creation of new life.

These aspects of Hathor were linked with the myth of the Eye of Ra. The Eye was pacified by beer in the story of the Destruction of Mankind. In some versions of the Distant Goddess myth, the wandering Eye&#x27;s wildness abated when she was appeased with products of civilization like music, dance, and wine. The water of the annual flooding of the Nile, colored red by sediment, was likened to wine, and to the red-dyed beer in the Destruction of Mankind. Festivals during the inundation therefore incorporated drink, music, and dance as a way to appease the returning goddess. A text from the Temple of Edfu says of Hathor, &quot;the gods play the sistrum for her, the goddesses dance for her to dispel her bad temper.&quot; A hymn to the goddess Raet-Tawy as a form of Hathor at the temple of Medamud describes the Festival of Drunkenness (Tekh Festival) as part of her mythic return to Egypt. Women carry bouquets of flowers, drunken revelers play drums, and people and animals from foreign lands dance for her as she enters the temple&#x27;s festival booth. The noise of the celebration drives away hostile powers and ensures the goddess will remain in her joyful form as she awaits the male god of the temple, her mythological consort Montu, whose son she will bear.

===Sexuality, beauty, and love===

Hathor&#x27;s joyful, ecstatic side indicates her feminine, procreative power. In some creation myths she helped produce the world itself. Atum, a creator god who contained all things within himself, was said to have produced his children Shu and Tefnut, and thus begun the process of creation, by masturbating. The hand he used for this act, the Hand of Atum, represented the female aspect of himself and could be personified by Hathor, Nebethetepet, or another goddess, Iusaaset. In a late creation myth from the Ptolemaic Period (332–30 BC), the god Khonsu is put in a central role, and Hathor is the goddess with whom Khonsu mates to enable creation.

Hathor could be the consort of many male gods, of whom Ra was only the most prominent. Mut was the usual consort of Amun, the preeminent deity during the New Kingdom who was often linked with Ra. But Mut was rarely portrayed alongside Amun in contexts related to sex or fertility, and in those circumstances, Hathor or Isis stood at his side instead. In the late periods of Egyptian history, the form of Hathor from Dendera and the form of Horus from Edfu were considered husband and wife and in different versions of the myth of the Distant Goddess, Hathor-Raettawy was the consort of Montu and Hathor-Tefnut the consort of Shu.

Hathor&#x27;s sexual side was seen in some short stories. In a cryptic fragment of a Middle Kingdom story, known as &quot;The Tale of the Herdsman&quot;, a herdsman encounters a hairy, animal-like goddess in a marsh and reacts with terror. On another day he encounters her as a nude, alluring woman. Most Egyptologists who study this story think this woman is Hathor or a goddess like her, one who can be wild and dangerous or benign and erotic. Thomas Schneider interprets the text as implying that between his two encounters with the goddess the herdsman has done something to pacify her. In &quot;The Contendings of Horus and Set&quot;, a New Kingdom short story about the dispute between those two gods, Ra is upset after being insulted by another god, Babi, and lies on his back alone. After some time, Hathor exposes her genitals to Ra, making him laugh and get up again to perform his duties as ruler of the gods. Life and order were thought to be dependent on Ra&#x27;s activity, and the story implies that Hathor averted the disastrous consequences of his idleness. Her act may have lifted Ra&#x27;s spirits partly because it sexually aroused him, although why he laughed is not fully understood.

Hathor was praised for her beautiful hair. Egyptian literature contains allusions to a myth not clearly described in any surviving texts, in which Hathor lost a lock of hair that represented her sexual allure. One text compares this loss with Horus&#x27;s loss of his divine Eye and Set&#x27;s loss of his testicles during the struggle between the two gods, implying that the loss of Hathor&#x27;s lock was as catastrophic for her as the maiming of Horus and Set was for them.

Hathor was called &quot;mistress of love&quot;, as an extension of her sexual aspect. In the series of love poems from Papyrus Chester BeattyI, from the Twentieth Dynasty (c. 1189–1077 BC), men and women ask Hathor to bring their lovers to them: &quot;I prayed to her [Hathor] and she heard my prayer. She destined my mistress [loved one] for me. And she came of her own free will to see me.&quot;

===Motherhood and queenship===

Hathor was considered the mother of various child deities. As suggested by her name, she was often thought of as both Horus&#x27;s mother and consort. As both the king&#x27;s wife and his heir&#x27;s mother, Hathor was the divine counterpart of human queens.

Isis and Osiris were considered Horus&#x27;s parents in the Osiris myth as far back as the late Old Kingdom, but the relationship between Horus and Hathor may be older still. If so, Horus only came to be linked with Isis and Osiris as the Osiris myth emerged during the Old Kingdom. Even after Isis was firmly established as Horus&#x27;s mother, Hathor continued to appear in this role, especially when nursing the pharaoh. Images of the Hathor-cow with a child in a papyrus thicket represented his mythological upbringing in a secluded marsh. Goddesses&#x27; milk was a sign of divinity and royal status. Thus, images in which Hathor nurses the pharaoh represent his right to rule. Hathor&#x27;s relationship with Horus gave a healing aspect to her character, as she was said to have restored Horus&#x27;s missing eye or eyes after Set attacked him. In the version of this episode in &quot;The Contendings of Horus and Set&quot;, Hathor finds Horus with his eyes torn out and heals the wounds with gazelle&#x27;s milk.

Beginning in the Late Period (664–323 BC), temples focused on the worship of a divine family: an adult male deity, his wife, and their immature son. Satellite buildings, known as mammisis, were built in celebration of the birth of the local child deity. The child god represented the cyclical renewal of the cosmos and an archetypal heir to the kingship. Hathor was the mother in many of these local divine triads. At Dendera, the mature Horus of Edfu was the father and Hathor the mother, while their child was Ihy, a god whose name meant &quot;sistrum-player&quot; and who personified the jubilation associated with the instrument. At Kom Ombo, Hathor&#x27;s local form, Tasenetnofret, was mother to Horus&#x27;s son Panebtawy. Other children of Hathor included a minor deity from the town of Hu, named Neferhotep, and several child forms of Horus.

The milky sap of the sycamore tree, which the Egyptians regarded as a symbol of life, became one of her symbols. The milk was equated with water of the Nile inundation and thus fertility. In the late Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, many temples contained a creation myth that adapted long-standing ideas about creation. The version from Hathor&#x27;s temple at Dendera emphasizes that she, as a female solar deity, was the first being to emerge from the primordial waters that preceded creation, and her life-giving light and milk nourished all living things.

Hathor&#x27;s maternal aspects can be compared with those of Isis and Mut, yet there are many contrasts between them. Isis&#x27;s devotion to her husband and care for their child represented a more socially acceptable form of love than Hathor&#x27;s uninhibited sexuality, and Mut&#x27;s character was more authoritative than sexual. The text of the 1st century CE Insinger Papyrus likens a faithful wife, the mistress of a household, to Mut, while comparing Hathor to a strange woman who tempts a married man.

===Fate===
Like Meskhenet, another goddess who presided over birth, Hathor was connected with &quot;shai&quot;, the Egyptian concept of fate, particularly when she took the form of the Seven Hathors. In two New Kingdom works of fiction, the &quot;Tale of Two Brothers&quot; and the &quot;Tale of the Doomed Prince&quot;, the Hathors appear at the births of major characters and foretell the manner of their deaths. The Egyptians tended to think of fate as inexorable. Yet in &quot;The Tale of the Doomed Prince&quot;, the prince who is its protagonist is able to escape one of the possible violent deaths that the Seven Hathors have foretold for him, and while the end of the story is missing, the surviving portions imply that the prince can escape his fate with the help of the gods.

===Foreign lands and goods===
Hathor was connected with trade and foreign lands, possibly because her role as a sky goddess linked her with stars and hence navigation, and because she was believed to protect ships on the Nile and in the seas beyond Egypt as she protected the barque of Ra in the sky. The mythological wandering of the Eye goddess in Nubia or Libya gave her a connection with those lands as well.

Egypt maintained trade relations with the coastal cities of Syria and Canaan, particularly Byblos, placing Egyptian religion in contact with the religions of that region. At some point, perhaps as early as the Old Kingdom, the Egyptians began to refer to the patron goddess of Byblos, Baalat Gebal, as a local form of Hathor. So strong was Hathor&#x27;s link to Byblos that texts from Dendera say she resided there. The Egyptians sometimes equated Anat, an aggressive Canaanite goddess who came to be worshipped in Egypt during the New Kingdom, with Hathor. Some Canaanite artworks depict a nude goddess with a curling wig taken from Hathor&#x27;s iconography. Which goddess these images represent is not known, but the Egyptians adopted her iconography and came to regard her as an independent deity, Qetesh, whom they associated with Hathor.

Hathor was closely connected with the Sinai Peninsula, which was not considered part of Egypt proper but was the site of Egyptian mines for copper, turquoise, and malachite during the Middle and New Kingdoms. One of Hathor&#x27;s epithets, &quot;Lady of &quot;Mefkat&quot;&quot;, may have referred specifically to turquoise or to all blue-green minerals. She was also called &quot;Lady of Faience&quot;, a blue-green ceramic that Egyptians likened to turquoise. Hathor was also worshipped at various quarries and mining sites in Egypt&#x27;s Eastern Desert, such as the amethyst mines of Wadi el-Hudi, where she was sometimes called &quot;Lady of Amethyst&quot;.

South of Egypt, Hathor&#x27;s influence was thought to have extended over the land of Punt, which lay along the Red Sea coast and was a major source for the incense with which Hathor was linked, as well as with Nubia, northwest of Punt. The autobiography of Harkhuf, an official in the Sixth Dynasty (c. 2345–2181 BC), describes his expedition to a land in or near Nubia, from which he brought back great quantities of ebony, panther skins, and incense for the king. The text describes these exotic goods as Hathor&#x27;s gift to the pharaoh. Egyptian expeditions to mine gold in Nubia introduced her cult to the region during the Middle and New Kingdoms, and New Kingdom pharaohs built several temples to her in the portions of Nubia that they ruled.

===Afterlife===

Although the Pyramid Texts, the earliest Egyptian funerary texts, rarely mention her, Hathor was invoked in private tomb inscriptions from the same era, and in the Middle Kingdom Coffin Texts and later sources, she is frequently linked with the afterlife.

Just as she crossed the boundary between Egypt and foreign lands, Hathor passed through the boundary between the living and the Duat, the realm of the dead. She helped the spirits of deceased humans enter the Duat and was closely linked with tomb sites, where that transition began. The necropolises, or clusters of tombs, on the west bank of the Nile were personified as Imentet, the goddess of the west, who was frequently regarded as a manifestation of Hathor. The Theban necropolis, for example, was often portrayed as a stylized mountain with the cow of Hathor emerging from it. Her role as a sky goddess was also linked to the afterlife. Because the sky goddess—either Nut or Hathor—assisted Ra in his daily rebirth, she had an important part in ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs, according to which deceased humans were reborn like the sun god. Coffins, tombs, and the underworld itself were interpreted as the womb of this goddess, from which the deceased soul would be reborn.

Nut, Hathor, and Imentet could each, in different texts, lead the deceased into a place where they would receive food and drink for eternal sustenance. Thus, Hathor, as Imentet, often appears on tombs, welcoming the deceased person as her child into a blissful afterlife. In New Kingdom funerary texts and artwork, the afterlife was often illustrated as a pleasant, fertile garden, over which Hathor sometimes presided. The welcoming afterlife goddess was often portrayed as a goddess in the form of a tree, giving water to the deceased. Nut most commonly filled this role, but the tree goddess was sometimes called Hathor instead.

The afterlife also had a sexual aspect. In the Osiris myth, the murdered god Osiris was resurrected when he copulated with Isis and conceived Horus. In solar ideology, Ra&#x27;s union with the sky goddess allowed his own rebirth. Sex therefore enabled the rebirth of the deceased, and goddesses like Isis and Hathor served to rouse the deceased to new life. But they merely stimulated the male deities&#x27; regenerative powers, rather than playing the central role.

Ancient Egyptians prefixed the names of the deceased with Osiris&#x27;s name to connect them with his resurrection. For example, a woman named Henutmehyt would be dubbed &quot;Osiris-Henutmehyt&quot;. Over time they increasingly associated the deceased with both male and female divine powers. As early as the late Old Kingdom, women were sometimes said to join the worshippers of Hathor in the afterlife, just as men joined the following of Osiris. In the Third Intermediate Period (c. 1070–664 BC), Egyptians began to add Hathor&#x27;s name to that of deceased women in place of that of Osiris. In some cases, women were called &quot;Osiris-Hathor&quot;, indicating that they benefited from the revivifying power of both deities. In these late periods, Hathor was sometimes said to rule the afterlife as Osiris did.

==Iconography==

Hathor was often depicted as a cow bearing the sun disk between her horns, especially when shown nursing the king. She could also appear as a woman with the head of a cow. Her most common form, however, was a woman wearing a headdress of the horns and sun disk, often with a red or turquoise sheath dress, or a dress combining both colors. Sometimes the horns stood atop a low modius or the vulture headdress that Egyptian queens often wore in the New Kingdom. Because Isis adopted the same headdress during the New Kingdom, the two goddesses can be distinguished only if labeled in writing. When in the role of Imentet, Hathor wore the emblem of the west upon her head instead of the horned headdress. The Seven Hathors were sometimes portrayed as a set of seven cows, accompanied by a minor sky and afterlife deity called the Bull of the West.

Some animals other than cattle could represent Hathor. The uraeus was a common motif in Egyptian art and could represent a variety of goddesses who were identified with the Eye of Ra. When Hathor was depicted as a uraeus, it represented the ferocious and protective aspects of her character. She also appeared as a lioness, and this form had a similar meaning. In contrast, the domestic cat, which was sometimes connected with Hathor, often represented the Eye goddess&#x27;s pacified form. When portrayed as a sycamore tree, Hathor was usually shown with the upper body of her human form emerging from the trunk.

Like other goddesses, Hathor might carry a stalk of papyrus as a staff, though she could instead hold a &quot;was&quot; staff, a symbol of power that was usually restricted to male deities. The only goddesses who used the &quot;was&quot; were those, like Hathor, who were linked with the Eye of Ra. She also commonly carried a sistrum or a &quot;menat&quot; necklace. The sistrum came in two varieties: a simple loop shape or the more complex &quot;naos&quot; sistrum, which was shaped to resemble a &quot;naos&quot; shrine and flanked by volutes resembling the antennae of the Bat emblem. Mirrors were another of her symbols, because in Egypt they were often made of gold or bronze and therefore symbolized the sun disk, and because they were connected with beauty and femininity. Some mirror handles were made in the shape of Hathor&#x27;s face. The &quot;menat&quot; necklace, made up of many strands of beads, was shaken in ceremonies in Hathor&#x27;s honor, similarly to the sistrum. Images of it were sometimes seen as personifications of Hathor herself.

Hathor was sometimes represented as a human face with bovine ears, seen from the front rather than in the profile-based perspective that was typical of Egyptian art. When she appears in this form, the tresses on either side of her face often curl into loops. This mask-like face was placed on the capitals of columns beginning in the late Old Kingdom. Columns of this style were used in many temples to Hathor and other goddesses. These columns have two or four faces, which may represent the duality between different aspects of the goddess or the watchfulness of Hathor of the Four Faces. The designs of Hathoric columns have a complex relationship with those of sistra. Both styles of sistrum can bear the Hathor mask on the handle, and Hathoric columns often incorporate the &quot;naos&quot; sistrum shape above the goddess&#x27;s head.

==Worship==

===Relationship with royalty===

During the Early Dynastic Period, Neith was the preeminent goddess at the royal court, while in the Fourth Dynasty, Hathor became the goddess most closely linked with the king. Sneferu, the founder of the Fourth Dynasty, may have built a temple to her, and Neferhetepes, a daughter of Djedefra, was the first recorded priestess of Hathor. Old Kingdom rulers donated resources only to temples dedicated to particular kings or to deities closely connected with kingship. Hathor was one of the few deities to receive such donations. Late Old Kingdom rulers especially promoted the cult of Hathor in the provinces, as a way of binding those regions to the royal court. She may have absorbed the traits of contemporary provincial goddesses.

Many female royals, though not reigning queens, held positions in the cult during the Old Kingdom. Mentuhotep II, who became the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom despite having no relation to the Old Kingdom rulers, sought to legitimize his rule by portraying himself as Hathor&#x27;s son. The first images of the Hathor-cow suckling the king date to his reign, and several priestesses of Hathor were depicted as though they were his wives, although he may not have actually married them. In the course of the Middle Kingdom, queens were increasingly seen as directly embodying the goddess, just as the king embodied Ra. The emphasis on the queen as Hathor continued through the New Kingdom. Queens were portrayed with the headdress of Hathor beginning in the late Eighteenth Dynasty. An image of the sed festival of Amenhotep III, meant to celebrate and renew his rule, shows the king together with Hathor and his queen Tiye, which could mean that the king symbolically married the goddess in the course of the festival.

Hatshepsut, a woman who ruled as a pharaoh in the early New Kingdom, emphasized her relationship to Hathor in a different way. She used names and titles that linked her to a variety of goddesses, including Hathor, so as to legitimize her rule in what was normally a male position. She built several temples to Hathor and placed her own mortuary temple, which incorporated a chapel dedicated to the goddess, at Deir el-Bahari, which had been a cult site of Hathor since the Middle Kingdom.

The preeminence of Amun during the New Kingdom gave greater visibility to his consort Mut, and in the course of the period, Isis began appearing in roles that traditionally belonged to Hathor alone, such as that of the goddess in the solar barque. Despite the growing prominence of these deities, Hathor remained important, particularly in relation to fertility, sexuality, and queenship, throughout the New Kingdom.

After the New Kingdom, Isis increasingly overshadowed Hathor and other goddesses as she took on their characteristics. In the Ptolemaic period (305–30 BC), when Greeks governed Egypt and their religion developed a complex relationship with that of Egypt, the Ptolemaic dynasty adopted and modified the Egyptian ideology of kingship. Beginning with Arsinoe II, wife of Ptolemy II, the Ptolemies closely linked their queens with Isis and with several Greek goddesses, particularly their own goddess of love and sexuality, Aphrodite. Nevertheless, when the Greeks referred to Egyptian gods by the names of their own gods (a practice called &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot;), they sometimes called Hathor Aphrodite. Traits of Isis, Hathor, and Aphrodite were all combined to justify the treatment of Ptolemaic queens as goddesses. Thus, the poet Callimachus alluded to the myth of Hathor&#x27;s lost lock of hair in the &quot;Aetia&quot; when praising Berenice II for sacrificing her own hair to Aphrodite, and iconographic traits that Isis and Hathor shared, such as the bovine horns and vulture headdress, appeared on images portraying Ptolemaic queens as Aphrodite.

===Temples in Egypt===

More temples were dedicated to Hathor than to any other Egyptian goddess. During the Old Kingdom her most important center of worship was in the region of Memphis, where &quot;Hathor of the Sycamore&quot; was worshipped at many sites throughout the Memphite Necropolis. During the New Kingdom era, the temple of Hathor of the Southern Sycamore was her main temple in Memphis. At that site she was described as the daughter of the city&#x27;s main deity, Ptah. The cult of Ra and Atum at Heliopolis, northeast of Memphis, included a temple to Hathor-Nebethetepet that was probably built in the Middle Kingdom. A willow and a sycamore tree stood near the sanctuary and may have been worshipped as manifestations of the goddess. A few cities farther north in the Nile Delta, such as Yamu and Terenuthis, also had temples to her.

Dendera, Hathor&#x27;s oldest temple in Upper Egypt, dates to at least to the Fourth Dynasty. After the end of the Old Kingdom it surpassed her Memphite temples in importance. Many kings made additions to the temple complex through Egyptian history. The last version of the temple was built in the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods and is today one of the best-preserved Egyptian temples from that time.

As the rulers of the Old Kingdom made an effort to develop towns in Upper and Middle Egypt, several cult centers of Hathor were founded across the region, at sites such as Cusae, Akhmim, and Naga ed-Der. In the First Intermediate Period (c. 2181–2055 BC) her cult statue from Dendera was periodically carried to the Theban necropolis. During the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, MentuhotepII established a permanent cult center for her in the necropolis at Deir el-Bahari. The nearby village of Deir el-Medina, home to the tomb workers of the necropolis during the New Kingdom, also contained temples of Hathor. One continued to function and was periodically rebuilt as late as the Ptolemaic Period, centuries after the village was abandoned.

In the Old Kingdom, most priests of Hathor, including the highest ranks, were women. Many of these women were members of the royal family. In the course of the Middle Kingdom, women were increasingly excluded from the highest priestly positions, at the same time that queens were becoming more closely tied to Hathor&#x27;s cult. Thus, non-royal women disappeared from the high ranks of Hathor&#x27;s priesthood, although women continued to serve as musicians and singers in temple cults across Egypt.

The most frequent temple rite for any deity was the daily offering ritual, in which the cult image, or statue, of a deity would be clothed and given food. The daily ritual was largely the same in every Egyptian temple, although the goods given as offerings could vary according to which deity received them. Wine and beer were common offerings in all temples, but especially in rituals in Hathor&#x27;s honor, and she and the goddesses related to her often received sistra and &quot;menat&quot; necklaces. In Late and Ptolemaic times, they were also offered a pair of mirrors, representing the sun and the moon.

===Festivals===

Many of Hathor&#x27;s annual festivals were celebrated with drinking and dancing that served a ritual purpose. Revelers at these festivals may have aimed to reach a state of religious ecstasy, which was otherwise rare or nonexistent in ancient Egyptian religion. Graves-Brown suggests that celebrants in Hathor&#x27;s festivals aimed to reach an altered state of consciousness to allow them interact with the divine realm. An example is the Festival of Drunkenness, commemorating the return of the Eye of Ra, which was celebrated on the twentieth day of the month of Thout at temples to Hathor and to other Eye goddesses. It was celebrated as early as the Middle Kingdom, but it is best known from Ptolemaic and Roman times. The dancing, eating and drinking that took place during the Festival of Drunkenness represented the opposite of the sorrow, hunger, and thirst that the Egyptians associated with death. Whereas the rampages of the Eye of Ra brought death to humans, the Festival of Drunkenness celebrated life, abundance, and joy.

In a local Theban festival known as the Beautiful Festival of the Valley, which began to be celebrated in the Middle Kingdom, the cult image of Amun from the Temple of Karnak visited the temples in the Theban Necropolis while members of the community went to the tombs of their deceased relatives to drink, eat, and celebrate. Hathor was not involved in this festival until the early New Kingdom, after which Amun&#x27;s overnight stay in the temples at Deir el-Bahari came to be seen as his sexual union with her.

Several temples in Ptolemaic times, including that of Dendera, observed the Egyptian new year with a series of ceremonies in which images of the temple deity were supposed to be revitalized by contact with the sun god. On the days leading up to the new year, Dendera&#x27;s statue of Hathor was taken to the &quot;wabet&quot;, a specialized room in the temple, and placed under a ceiling decorated with images of the sky and sun. On the first day of the new year, the first day of the month of Thoth, the Hathor image was carried up to the roof to be bathed in genuine sunlight.

The best-documented festival focused on Hathor is another Ptolemaic celebration, the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion. It took place over fourteen days in the month of Epiphi. Hathor&#x27;s cult image from Dendera was carried by boat to several temple sites to visit the gods of those temples. The endpoint of the journey was the Temple of Horus at Edfu, where the Hathor statue from Dendera met that of Horus of Edfu and the two were placed together. On one day of the festival, these images were carried out to a shrine where primordial deities such as the sun god and the Ennead were said to be buried. The texts say the divine couple performed offering rites for these entombed gods. Many Egyptologists regard this festival as a ritual marriage between Horus and Hathor, although Martin Stadler challenges this view, arguing that it instead represented the rejuvenation of the buried creator gods. C. J. Bleeker thought the Beautiful Reunion was another celebration of the return of the Distant Goddess, citing allusions in the temple&#x27;s festival texts to the myth of the solar eye. Barbara Richter argues that the festival represented all three things at once. She points out that the birth of Horus and Hathor&#x27;s son Ihy was celebrated at Dendera nine months after the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion, implying that Hathor&#x27;s visit to Horus represented Ihy&#x27;s conception.

The third month of the Egyptian calendar, Hathor or Athyr, was named for the goddess. Festivities in her honor took place throughout the month, although they are not recorded in the texts from Dendera.

===Worship outside Egypt===

Egyptian kings as early as the Old Kingdom donated goods to the temple of Baalat Gebal in Byblos, using the syncretism of Baalat with Hathor to cement their close trading relationship with Byblos. A temple to Hathor as Lady of Byblos was built during the reign of Thutmose III, although it may simply have been a shrine within the temple of Baalat. After the breakdown of the New Kingdom, Hathor&#x27;s prominence in Byblos diminished along with Egypt&#x27;s trade links to the city. A few artifacts from the early first millennium BC suggest that the Egyptians began equating Baalat with Isis at that time. A myth about Isis&#x27;s presence in Byblos, related by the Greek author Plutarch in his work &quot;On Isis and Osiris&quot; in the 2nd century AD, suggests that by his time Isis had entirely supplanted Hathor in the city.

A pendant found in a Mycenaean tomb at Pylos, from the 16th century BC, bears Hathor&#x27;s face. Its presence in the tomb suggests the Mycenaeans may have known that the Egyptians connected Hathor with the afterlife.

Egyptians in the Sinai Peninsula built a few temples in the region. The largest was a complex dedicated primarily to Hathor as patroness of mining at Serabit el-Khadim, on the west side of the peninsula. It was occupied from the middle of the Middle Kingdom to near the end of the New. The Timna Valley, on the fringes of the Egyptian empire on the east side of the peninsula, was the site of seasonal mining expeditions during the New Kingdom. It included a shrine to Hathor that was probably deserted during the off-season. The local Midianites, whom the Egyptians used as part of the mining workforce, may have given offerings to Hathor as their overseers did. After the Egyptians abandoned the site in the Twentieth Dynasty, however, the Midianites converted the shrine to a tent shrine devoted to their own deities.

In contrast, the Nubians in the south fully incorporated Hathor into their religion. During the New Kingdom, when most of Nubia was under Egyptian control, pharaohs dedicated several temples in Nubia to Hathor, such as those at Faras and Mirgissa. AmenhotepIII and Ramesses II both built temples in Nubia that celebrated their respective queens as manifestations of female deities, including Hathor: Amenhotep&#x27;s wife Tiye at Sedeinga and Ramesses&#x27;s wife Nefertari at the Small Temple of Abu Simbel. The independent Kingdom of Kush, which emerged in Nubia after the collapse of the New Kingdom, based its beliefs about Kushite kings on the royal ideology of Egypt. Therefore, Hathor, Isis, Mut, and Nut were all seen as the mythological mother of each Kushite king and equated with his female relatives, such as the &quot;kandake&quot;, the Kushite queen or queen mother, who had prominent roles in Kushite religion. At Jebel Barkal, a site sacred to Amun, the Kushite king Taharqa built a pair of temples, one dedicated to Hathor and one to Mut as consorts of Amun, replacing New Kingdom Egyptian temples that may have been dedicated to these same goddesses. But Isis was the most prominent of the Egyptian goddesses worshipped in Nubia, and her status there increased over time. Thus, in the Meroitic period of Nubian history (c. 300 BCAD 400), Hathor appeared in temples mainly as a companion to Isis.

===Popular worship===

In addition to formal and public rituals at temples, Egyptians privately worshipped deities for personal reasons, including at their homes. Birth was hazardous for both mother and child in ancient Egypt, yet children were much desired. Thus fertility and safe childbirth are among the most prominent concerns in popular religion, and fertility deities such as Hathor and Taweret were commonly worshipped in household shrines. Egyptian women squatted on bricks while giving birth, and the only known surviving birth brick from ancient Egypt is decorated with an image of a woman holding her child flanked by images of Hathor. In Roman times, terracotta figurines, sometimes found in a domestic context, depicted a woman with an elaborate headdress exposing her genitals, as Hathor did to cheer up Ra. The meaning of these figurines is not known, but they are often thought to represent Hathor or Isis combined with Aphrodite making a gesture that represented fertility or protection against evil.

Hathor was one of a handful of deities, including Amun, Ptah, and Thoth, who were commonly prayed to for help with personal problems. Many Egyptians left offerings at temples or small shrines dedicated to the gods they prayed to. Most offerings to Hathor were used for their symbolism, not for their intrinsic value. Cloths painted with images of Hathor were common, as were plaques and figurines depicting her animal forms. Different types of offerings may have symbolized different goals on the part of the donor, but their meaning is usually unknown. Images of Hathor alluded to her mythical roles, like depictions of the maternal cow in the marsh. Offerings of sistra may have been meant to appease the goddess&#x27;s dangerous aspects and bring out her positive ones, while phalli represented a prayer for fertility, as shown by an inscription found on one example.

Some Egyptians also left written prayers to Hathor, inscribed on stelae or written as graffiti. Prayers to some deities, such as Amun, show that they were thought to punish wrongdoers and heal people who repented for their misbehavior. In contrast, prayers to Hathor mention only the benefits she could grant, such as abundant food during life and a well-provisioned burial after death.

===Funerary practices===

As an afterlife deity, Hathor appeared frequently in funerary texts and art. In the early New Kingdom, for instance, she was one of the three deities most commonly found in royal tomb decoration, the others being Osiris and Anubis. In that period she often appeared as the goddess welcoming the dead into the afterlife. Other images referred to her more obliquely. Reliefs in Old Kingdom tombs show men and women performing a ritual called &quot;shaking the papyrus&quot;. The significance of this rite is not known, but inscriptions sometimes say it was performed &quot;for Hathor&quot;, and shaking papyrus stalks produces a rustling sound that may have been likened to the rattling of a sistrum. Other Hathoric imagery in tombs included the cow emerging from the mountain of the necropolis and the seated figure of the goddess presiding over a garden in the afterlife. Images of Nut were often painted or incised inside coffins, indicating the coffin was her womb, from which the occupant would be reborn in the afterlife. In the Third Intermediate Period, Hathor began to be placed on the floor of the coffin, with Nut on the interior of the lid.

Tomb art from the Eighteenth Dynasty often shows people drinking, dancing, and playing music, as well as holding &quot;menat&quot; necklaces and sistra—all imagery that alluded to Hathor. These images may represent private feasts that were celebrated in front of tombs to commemorate the people buried there, or they may show gatherings at temple festivals such as the Beautiful Festival of the Valley. Festivals were thought to allow contact between the human and divine realms, and by extension, between the living and the dead. Thus, texts from tombs often expressed a wish that the deceased would be able to participate in festivals, primarily those dedicated to Osiris. Tombs&#x27; festival imagery, however, may refer to festivals involving Hathor, such as the Festival of Drunkenness, or to the private feasts, which were also closely connected with her. Drinking and dancing at these feasts may have been meant to intoxicate the celebrants, as at the Festival of Drunkenness, allowing them to commune with the spirits of the deceased.

Hathor was said to supply offerings to deceased people as early as the Old Kingdom, and spells to enable both men and women to join her retinue in the afterlife appeared as early as the Coffin Texts. Some burial goods that portray deceased women as goddesses may depict these women as followers of Hathor, although whether the imagery refers to Hathor or Isis is not known. The link between Hathor and deceased women was maintained into the Roman Period, the last stage of ancient Egyptian religion before its extinction.

<text>Moral realism (also ethical realism) is the position that ethical sentences express propositions that refer to objective features of the world (that is, features independent of subjective opinion), some of which may be true to the extent that they report those features accurately. This makes moral realism a non-nihilist form of ethical cognitivism (which accepts that ethical sentences express propositions and can therefore be true or false) with an ontological orientation, standing in opposition to all forms of moral anti-realism and moral skepticism, including ethical subjectivism (which denies that moral propositions refer to objective facts), error theory (which denies that any moral propositions are true), and non-cognitivism (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all). Moral realism&#x27;s two main subdivisions are ethical naturalism and ethical non-naturalism.

Most philosophers claim that moral realism dates at least to Plato as a philosophical doctrine and that it is a fully defensible form of moral doctrine. A 2009 survey involving 3,226 respondents found that 56% of philosophers accept or lean toward moral realism (28%: anti-realism; 16%: other). A 2020 study found that 62.1% accept or lean toward realism. Some notable examples of robust moral realists include David Brink, John McDowell, Peter Railton, Geoffrey Sayre-McCord, Michael Smith, Terence Cuneo, Russ Shafer-Landau, G. E. Moore, John Finnis, Richard Boyd, Nicholas Sturgeon, Thomas Nagel, Derek Parfit, and Peter Singer. Norman Geras has argued that Karl Marx was a moral realist. Moral realism&#x27;s various philosophical and practical applications have been studied.

==Robust versus minimal moral realism==
A delineation of moral realism into a minimal form, a moderate form, and a robust form has been put forward in the literature.

The robust model of moral realism commits moral realists to three theses:

* &quot;The semantic thesis:&quot; The primary semantic role of moral predicates (such as &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;) is to refer to moral properties (such as rightness and wrongness), so that moral statements (such as &quot;honesty is good&quot; and &quot;slavery is unjust&quot;) purport to represent moral facts, and express propositions that are true or false (or approximately true, largely false, and so on).
* &quot;The alethic thesis:&quot; Some moral propositions are in fact true.
* &quot;The metaphysical thesis:&quot; Moral propositions are true when actions and other objects of moral assessment have the relevant moral properties (so that the relevant moral facts obtain), where these facts and properties are robust: their metaphysical status, whatever it is, is not relevantly different from that of (certain types of) ordinary non-moral facts and properties.

The minimal model leaves off the metaphysical thesis, treating it as matter of contention &quot;among&quot; moral realists (as opposed to &quot;between&quot; moral realists and moral anti-realists). This dispute is not insignificant, as acceptance or rejection of the metaphysical thesis is taken by those employing the robust model as the key difference between moral realism and moral anti-realism. Indeed, the question of how to classify certain logically possible (if eccentric) views—such as the rejection of the semantic and alethic theses in conjunction with the acceptance of the metaphysical thesis—turns on which model we accept. Someone employing the robust model might call such a view &quot;realist non-cognitivism,&quot; while someone employing the minimal model might simply place such a view alongside other, more traditional, forms of non-cognitivism.

The robust model and the minimal model also disagree over how to classify moral subjectivism (roughly, the view that moral facts are not mind-independent in the relevant sense, but that moral statements may still be true). The historical association of subjectivism with moral anti-realism in large part explains why the robust model of moral realism has been dominant—even if only implicitly—both in the traditional and contemporary philosophical literature on metaethics.

In the minimal sense of realism, R. M. Hare could be considered a realist in his later works, as he is committed to the objectivity of value judgments, even though he denies that moral statements express propositions with truth-values per se. Moral constructivists like John Rawls and Christine Korsgaard may also be realists in this minimalist sense; the latter describes her own position as procedural realism. Some readings of evolutionary science such as those of Charles Darwin and James Mark Baldwin have suggested that in so far as an ethics may be associated with survival strategies and natural selection then such behavior may be associated with a moderate position of moral realism equivalent to an ethics of survival.

== Ethical objectivism ==
Moral objectivism is the view that what is right or wrong does not depend on what anyone thinks is right or wrong, but rather on how it affects people&#x27;s well-being. Moral objectivism allows for moral codes to be compared to each other through a set of universal facts. Nicholas Reschar says that moral codes cannot derive from one&#x27;s personal moral compass. An example is Immanuel Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative: &quot;Act only according to that maxim [i.e., rule] whereby you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.&quot; John Stuart Mill proposed utilitarianism, which asserts that in any situation, the right thing to do is whatever is likely to produce the most happiness overall.

According to the ethical objectivist, the truth or falsehood of typical moral judgments does not depend upon any person&#x27;s or group of persons&#x27; beliefs or feelings. This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about chemistry, biology, or history, insomuch as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false—no matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels.

There are many versions of ethical objectivism, including various religious views of morality, Platonistic intuitionism, Kantianism, utilitarianism, and certain forms of ethical egoism and contractualism. Platonists define ethical objectivism even more narrowly, so that it requires the existence of intrinsic value. Consequently, they reject the idea that contractualists or egoists could be ethical objectivists. Objectivism, in turn, places primacy on the origin of the frame of reference and considers any arbitrary frame of reference a form of ethical subjectivism by a transitive property, even when the frame incidentally coincides with reality.

==Advantages==
Moral realism allows the ordinary rules of logic (modus ponens, etc.) to be applied straightforwardly to moral statements. We can say that a moral belief is &quot;false&quot; or &quot;unjustified&quot; or &quot;contradictory&quot; in the same way we would about a factual belief. This is a problem for expressivism, as shown by the Frege–Geach problem.

Another advantage of moral realism is its capacity to resolve moral disagreements: if two moral beliefs contradict one another, realism says that they cannot both be right, and therefore everyone involved ought to be seeking out the right answer to resolve the disagreement. Contrary theories of meta-ethics have trouble even formulating the statement &quot;this moral belief is wrong,&quot; and so they cannot resolve disagreements in this way.

== Proponents ==
Peter Railton&#x27;s moral realism is often associated with a naturalist approach. He argues that moral facts can be reduced to non-moral facts and that our moral claims aim to describe an objective reality. In his well-known paper &quot;Moral Realism&quot; (1986), Railton advocates for a form of moral realism that is naturalistic and scientifically accessible. He suggests that moral facts can be understood in terms of the naturalistic concept of an individual&#x27;s good. He employs a hypothetical observer&#x27;s standpoint to explain moral judgments. This standpoint considers what fully rational, well-informed, and sympathetic agents would agree upon under ideal conditions. Railton&#x27;s naturalistic approach aims to bridge the is-ought gap by explaining moral facts in terms of natural facts, and his theory is generally considered to be a response to the challenge of moral skepticism and anti-realism. By doing so, he attempts to show that moral facts are not mysterious or disconnected from the rest of the world, but can be understood and studied much like other natural phenomena.

Philippa Foot adopts a moral realist position, criticizing Stevenson&#x27;s idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a &quot;committal in a new dimension.&quot; She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word &quot;injury.&quot; Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, have not we fallen into the old naturalistic fallacy?

Foot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.
W. D. Ross articulates his moral realism in analogy to mathematics by stating that the moral order is just as real as &quot;the spatial or numerical structure expressed in the axioms of geometry or arithmetic&quot;.

In his defense of Divine Command Theory and thereby moral realism, C. Stephen Evans comments that the fact that there are significant moral disagreements does not undermine moral realism. Much of what may appear to be moral disagreement is actually disagreement over facts. In abortion debates, for example, the crux of the issue may really be whether a fetus is a human person. He goes on to comment that there are in fact tremendous amounts of moral agreement. There are five common principles that are recognized by different human cultures, including (1) A general duty not to harm others and a general duty to benefit others; (2) Special duties to those with whom one has special relations, such as friends and family members; (3) Duties to be truthful; (4) Duties to keep one&#x27;s commitments and promises; (5) Duties to deal fairly and justly with others.

==Criticisms==
Several criticisms have been raised against moral realism. A prominent criticism, articulated by J.L. Mackie, is that moral realism postulates the existence of &quot;entities or qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe. Correspondingly, if we were aware of them it would have to be by some faculty of moral perception or intuition, utterly different from our ordinary ways of knowing everything else.&quot; A number of theories have been developed for how we access objective moral truths, including ethical intuitionism and moral sense theory.

Another criticism of moral realism put forth by Mackie is that it can offer no plausible explanation for cross-cultural moral differences— ethical relativism. &quot;The actual variations in the moral codes are more readily explained by the hypothesis that they reflect ways of life than by the hypothesis that they express perceptions, most of them seriously inadequate and badly distorted, of objective values&quot;.

The evolutionary debunking argument suggests that because human psychology is primarily produced by evolutionary processes which do not seem to have a reason to be sensitive to moral facts, taking a moral realist stance can only lead to moral skepticism. The aim of the argument is to undercut the motivations for taking a moral realist stance, namely to be able to assert there are reliable moral standards.

Biologist Richard D. Alexander has argued that &quot;Ethical questions, and the study of morality or concepts of justice and right and wrong, derive solely from the existence of conflicts of interest&quot; and that such conflicts are a necessary consequence of genetic individuality. He also argues that &quot;Because morality involves conflicts of interest, it cannot easily be generalized into a universal despite virtually continual efforts by utilitarian philosophers to do that; morality does not derive its meaning from sets of universals or undeniable facts.&quot; Alexander’s views are shared by many scientists and starkly contradict moral realism.

==Beliefs among lay people==
A small amount of psychological research has explored the extent to which individuals perceive ethical beliefs as objective. A 2008 study by Goodwin and Darley investigated how people evaluate the objectivity of ethical statements compared to other types of statements, such as social conventions, tastes, and scientific facts. They found that individuals generally regard ethical statements as more objective than social conventions and tastes, but almost as objective as scientific facts. A subsequent 2012 study by Goodwin and Darley found that beliefs about negative immoral actions are generally perceived as more objective than beliefs about positive moral actions. Furthermore, the perceived consensus regarding a moral belief positively influences its perceived objectivity. The study also indicated that holding a moral belief to be objective is associated with a less tolerant response in the face of disagreement, and with more negative attributions towards those who disagree.

<text>Ihy is a young god in Egypt usually portrayed with the sistrum. This is in allusion to his mother Hathor who was associated with the instrument. Ihy&#x27;s symbols are the sistrum and a necklace. The name Ihy depicts the joy of playing the hand instrument by Hathor, or &quot;calf.&quot; The Egyptians themselves associated the name with the noisemaker.

Other goddesses including Isis, Sekhmet, and Neith are also sometimes seen as his mothers in different legends. War deity Horus is Ihy&#x27;s father, but sometimes solar deity Ra is also seen as his father. Ihy was depicted as a naked child, with curly hair, wearing a necklace and holding a sistrum or as a nude child with his finger in his mouth. He was worshipped along with Horus and Hathor as a trio at Dendera, Ihy&#x27;s main cult site, constructed early in the 4th dynasty.

Emperor Augustus prepared a second &quot;birthing house&quot; in the temple of Ihy&#x27;s mother, with pictures of Ihy&#x27;s birth and celebrations painted on the wall. Ihy is shown as the god of bread, beer, coffins, and the Book of the dead. There were mystery plays in 13 acts on fertility in these temples.

<text>Plön (; ) is the district seat of the Plön district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, and has about 8,700 inhabitants. It lies right on the shores of Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s biggest lake, the Great Plön Lake, as well as on several smaller lakes, touching the town on virtually all sides. The town&#x27;s landmark is Plön Castle, a chateau built in the 17th century on a hill overlooking the town.

Plön has a grammar school with a 300-year history, and is home to a German Navy non-commissioned officer school and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology. The town, nestled as it is in the hilly, wooded lake district of Holstein Switzerland (&quot;Holsteinische Schweiz&quot;), also has importance in the tourism industry.

==History==

In the course of the Migration Period, Slavic tribes entered the region of Plön during the early 7th century following the withdrawal of the original Germanic population. On the large island opposite Plön, which was later called &quot;Olsborg&quot;, they built a large fortification. They called their settlement &quot;Plune&quot;, which means &quot;ice-free water&quot;.

In 1075, Kruto lured Budivoj of the Nakonids into the &quot;castrum plunense&quot; (according to Helmold of Bosau), laid siege to him, and then once Budivoj&#x27;s men had given themselves up after Kruto&#x27;s promises to let them withdraw freely, Kruto had them slain. In 1139 the Count of Holstein, Adolf II of Schauenburg, destroyed the fortress, ending the domination of the Slavs in the region of Plön. Twenty years later, Adolf II had the castle on the island rebuilt, but soon had it moved to the present hill of &quot;Schlossberg&quot; (&quot;castle hill&quot;). It was here, under the protection of the castle and close to the major trading route from Lübeck to the north, that a Saxon market town emerged.

In 1236, Plön was granted town rights under Lübeck law. Strategically located on a narrow isthmus between the lakes and the River Schwentine, Plön remained a centre of the County of Holstein until the Danish royal house fell in the 15th century.

Between 1561 and 1729, Plön was the capital of the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön. The Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein-Plön emerged in 1622 as a result of succession in the Danish royal house. From 1633 to 1636 a Renaissance castle was built on the site of the old castle by Duke Joachim Ernest, and Plön became the capital of the small but independent princedom. As a residence town Plön experienced a considerable increase in status. For example, in 1685 Duke John Adolphus (&quot;Hans Adolf&quot;) founded the new town (&quot;Neustadt&quot;) northwest of the town in order to settle craftsmen here and thus increase the economic might of the duchy. Under Charles Frederick the castle district was expanded with several baroque buildings and a pleasure garden. At that time the town had about 1,000 inhabitants and reached as far as the bridge over the Schwentine in the east and as far as the end of today&#x27;s pedestrian zone in the west. Both entrances were protected by gates.
In 1761 the Duchy fell back into the hands of the Danish crown. Plön remained under Danish rule until the Second Schleswig War in 1864. Although it was the Danish king&#x27;s summer residence from time to time, it remained otherwise a sleepy provincial town of about 2,000 inhabitants. The cultural life of the minor residence was charmingly described by Rochus von Liliencron in his &quot;Childhood Memories&quot;. In the mid-19th century, the Danish crown prince spent a few years of his summer vacation in Plön Castle, since when it has been decorated in white plaster with a gray roof.

In 1867 Plön became a county town following the introduction of Prussian administrative reforms. The Hohenzollern princes were educated for a time in Plön. The Princes&#x27; Island (&quot;Prinzeninsel&quot;) is still owned by the House of Hohenzollern. Since 1868, Plön Castle was a Prussian military school. After World War I it became a boarding school that served as a 1933–1945 as a National Political Institutes of Education. Since 1946, it has again been a state boarding school. After the end of World War II, former NAPOLA pupils were often able to avail themselves of a form of ‘evasive selective memory’ that ultimately cast themselves as victims of the Nazi regime, and allowed them to make their own (sometimes very successful) way in postwar society.
 During the War, numerous forced laborers lived in Plön and the surrounding area. In the Plön cemetery, eight wooden crosses commemorate people who were probably forced laborers from Eastern Europe. According to a police report, forced laborers who were no longer able to work allegedly &#x27;drowned while going swimming&#x27; in the Plöner See.

In 1891 Emil Otto Zacharias founded the first &quot;Biological Station&quot; for freshwater research on German soil on the Plöner See. It was established as a private research institute with the aid of financial support from the Prussian government and several private citizens. After his death, August Thienemann took the lead. Its successor for a long time was the Max Planck Institute of Limnology, now renamed the &quot;Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology&quot; (see weblinks).
The Wehrmacht barracks at Stadtheide near Plön became the temporary location of the remaining members of the Hitler cabinet who had fled Berlin after the death of Adolf Hitler on 30 April 1945. 
Hitler believed that Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler was located in Plön and ordered newly appointed Luftwaffe commander Robert Ritter von Greim to fly there to arrest him. However, Himmler had left several hours before Von Greim&#x27;s arrival.

On 1 May, Commander of the Navy, Admiral Karl Dönitz, moved into the buildings of the Stadtheide Barracks but it was to be a short stay. Dönitz announced that Hitler had fallen and had appointed him as his successor. On 2 May Dönitz and the new Government Executive of the Reich fled to Flensburg before the approaching British troops and formed the short-lived Flensburg Government.

After WWII Plon was chosen as the site for King Alfred School, a secondary school for British Forces children under the headmastership of Freddie Spencer Chapman with his staff at the Ruhleben Barracks site, As such the town holds a place of affection with many former pupils across the world and the declining number of surviving teachers and their families. King Alfred School, Plön can rightly claim to be the first fully comprehensive school in the UK system. This school existed from 1948 to 1959. The Ruhleben Barracks site had been the German Navy U-boat training school and has now reverted to a similar function as M.U.S the non-commissioned officer school. The street nearby has a Lighthouse restaurant and down the street is a camping trailer park then a drug abuse hospital and a retirement castle. There are interesting free time activities like canoeing, walking and wandering in the woods or on the great lake.

The German boarding school in Plön Castle was closed in 2001 under the state government of Heide Simonis and the castle was sold to the Fielmann optical company. They re-opened it in October 2006, after extensive restoration work, as a school for opticians. The total cost of refurbishment and reconstruction was 35 million euros. Today it is a non-profit training centre for the whole field of optics. This has strengthened the economy of the town of Plön, which has become more widely known, even internationally. Each year the castle is home to six thousand Fielmann employees who receive training for anything up to a two-week period. Other students at the castle take part in B.A. and master optician courses. The castle has extensive grounds and is one of the most beautiful castles in Schleswig-Holstein. There are several restored historic buildings - such as the Princes&#x27; House (&quot;Prinzenhaus&quot;), Old Swimming Baths (&quot;Alte Schwimmhalle&quot;), Clock House (&quot;Uhrenhaus&quot;) - as well as shady avenues and old trees open to the public to stroll through and explore. Parts of Günther Fielmann&#x27;s own antique collection can be viewed at the castle; it encompasses pieces from the major north European and French epochs since the mid-seventeenth century.

The Princes&#x27; House is affectionately called the &quot;Pearl of the Rococo Period&quot;. It was previously used as a summer house and was given its present name when the sons of the last German Emperor, William II were taught in this building. After several years of restoration, it is now again open to the public. The &quot;Uhrenhaus&quot; now contains the information centre for the Holstein Switzerland Nature Park. The former imperial swimming pool is now a cultural forum, which is available for events and exhibitions. Evidence of the imperial era is still visible in many parts of Plon. For example, there is on the Princes&#x27; Island, a thatched pavilion, from where there is a view of the Great Plön Lake - this was a favourite haunt of the Empress. In the chapel at the Old Cemetery is an altar donated by Empress Augusta Victoria.

Relics of the Cold War can be found in the form of explosive vehicle traps along the Fünf-Seen-Allee (&quot;Five Lake Lane&quot;) near the old Five Lake Barracks (formerly home to the 6th Engineer Battalion (&quot;Pionierbataillon 6&quot;) and 6th Panzergrenadier Division), in Plön-Stadtheide.

<doc id="97332" wikidata="Q845614" url="?curid=97332" title="Maahes">
<text>Maahes (also spelled in Greek: Mihos, Miysis, Mios, Maihes, or Mahes) (Greek: Μαχές, Μιχός, Μίυσις, Μίος, or Μάιχες) was an ancient Egyptian lion-headed god of war, whose name means &quot;he who is true beside her&quot;. He was seen as the son of the Creator god Ptah, as well as the feline goddess (Bast in Lower Egypt or Sekhmet in Upper Egypt) whose nature he shared. Maahes was a deity associated with war, protection, and weather, as well as that of knives, lotuses, and devouring captives. His cult was centred in Taremu and Per-Bast, the cult centres of Sekhmet and Bast respectively.

==Name==

The name of Maahes begins with the hieroglyphs for the male &quot;lion&quot;, although in isolation it also means &quot;(one who can) see in front&quot;. Some of the titles of Maahes were &quot;Lord of Slaughter&quot;, &quot;Wielder of the Knife&quot;, and &quot;The Scarlet Lord&quot;.

==Origin==
The first recorded reference to Maahes is from the New Kingdom. Some Egyptologists have suggested that Maahes was of foreign origin; indeed there is some evidence that he may have been identical with the lion-god Apedemak worshipped in Nubia and Egypt&#x27;s Western Desert.

Maahes was considered the son of Ra with the feline goddess Bastet, or of another feline goddess, Sekhmet. He was sometimes identified with another son of Sekhmet, Nefertum. Maahes was said to fight Ra&#x27;s archenemy, the serpent Apep, during Ra&#x27;s nightly voyage.

Considered to have powerful attributes, feline deities were associated with the pharaohs, and became patrons of Egypt. The male lion hieroglyph was used in words such as &quot;prince&quot;, &quot;mashead&quot;, &quot;strength&quot;, and &quot;power&quot;.

==Depictions==

Maahes was pictured as a man with the head of a male lion, sometimes holding a knife and a bouquet of lotus flowers, referring to his connection with Nefertum, who was symbolized by the lotus.

==Sacred animals==
Tame lions were kept in a temple dedicated to Maahes in Taremu, where Bast/Sekhmet were worshipped, his temple was adjacent to that of Bast. The ancient Greek historian Aelian wrote: &quot;In Egypt, they worship lions, and there is a city called after them. (...) The lions have temples and numerous spaces in which to roam; the flesh of oxen is supplied to them daily (...) and the lions eat to the accompaniment of song in the Egyptian language&quot;, thus the Greek name of the city &quot;Leontopolis&quot; was derived.

<doc id="97334" wikidata="Q188931" url="?curid=97334" title="Bes">
<text>Bes (; also spelled as Bisu, ), together with his feminine counterpart Beset, is an ancient Egyptian deity, likely of Kushite/Nubian or Nehesi  C-Group culture origin worshipped as a protector of households and, in particular, of mothers, children, and childbirth. Bes later came to be regarded as the defender of everything good and the enemy of all that is bad. According to Donald Mackenzie in 1907, Bes may have been a Middle Kingdom import from Nubia or Somalia, and his cult did not become widespread until the beginning of the New Kingdom, but more recently several Bes-like figurines have been found in deposits from the Naqada period of pre-dynastic Egypt, like the thirteen figurines found at Tell el-Farkha.

Worship of Bes spread as far north as the area of Syria and as far west as the Balearic Islands (Ibiza) in Spain, and later into the Roman and Achaemenid Empires.

== Origin ==
People in Upper Egypt started venerating Bes long before people in Lower Egypt. The word “bes” means “cat” in Nubian, suggesting a possible Nubian or southern origin of Bes. It is also possible that the name Bes originated from one of two hieroglyphs: &quot;&quot;bs&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;flame&quot;, possibly in connection to Re, and/or &quot;&quot;bz&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;to be initiated&quot; or &quot;to introduce&quot; possibly in reference to masks apparently used in the cult of the god. Bes originally looked like a cat standing on his hind legs, before becoming more anthropomorphic and usually depicted with a leopard skin around his neck and resembling a person with dwarfism.

Bes is first mentioned in the Pyramid Texts, but seems to have been best known and most widely worshiped in the Middle Kingdom. Evidence of Bes worship in some capacity exists into Coptic Egypt, with the latest evidence being a jug depicting Bes found in Tell Edfu dating to the 10th century CE.

== Worship ==
Bes was a household protector, becoming responsible– throughout ancient Egyptian history– for such varied tasks as killing snakes, fighting off evil spirits, watching after children, and aiding women in labour by fighting off evil spirits, and thus present with Taweret at births.

Images of the deity, quite different from those of the other gods, were kept in homes. Normally Egyptian gods were shown in , but instead Bes appeared in full face portrait, ithyphallic, and sometimes in a soldier&#x27;s tunic, so as to appear ready to launch an attack on any approaching evil. He scared away demons from houses, so his statue was put up as a protector. Since he drove off evil, Bes also came to symbolize the good things in life– music, dance, and sexual pleasure. In the Middle Kingdom, Bes is depicted on a variety of objects, including masks, amulets, infant feeding bottles, and magic knives. In the New Kingdom, tattoos of Bes could be found on the thighs of dancers, musicians and servant girls.

Later, in the Ptolemaic period of Egyptian history, chambers were constructed at Saqqara, painted with images of Bes and his female counterpart Beset, thought by Egyptologists to have been for the purpose of curing fertility problems or general healing rituals.

Like many Egyptian gods, the worship of Bes or Beset was exported overseas. While the female variant had been more popular in Minoan Crete, the male version would prove popular with the Phoenicians and the ancient Cypriots.

At the end of the 6th century BC, images of Bes began to spread across the Achaemenid Empire, which Egypt belonged to at the time. Images of Bes have been found at the Persian capital of Susa, and as far away as central Asia. Over time, the image of Bes became more Persian in style, as he was depicted wearing Persian clothes and headdress.

== Iconography ==

=== Figurines ===
Modern scholars such as James Romano - Egyptologist and former Curator of Egyptian Art at the Brooklyn Museum - claim that in its earliest inception Bes was a representation of a lion rearing up on its hind legs. After the Third Intermediate Period, Bes can be found on a variety of household objects including furniture, toiletries, infant feeding bottles, game pieces, and more beginning in the Middle Kingdom.
=== Tattoos ===
As mentioned above, Bes is also seen depicted in tattoos. Wall art from the 19th Dynasty found at the workman&#x27;s village of Deir El-Medina depicts a tattoo of a dancing Bes on the thigh of a female musician playing her instrument.

=== Jugs ===

Jugs, vases, and other storage containers represent the majority of pottery containing Bes iconography. The depiction of an anthropomorphic head on jugs is a style predominately found in West Asian pottery, suggesting that there may be influence from the Syro-Palestinian region. Further supporting the possibility of West Asian influence is tomb 1300 of the Mayana cemetery near Sedment dating from the Second Intermediate Period that contains both vases depicting Bes and five small faience jugs almost certainly of Palestinian origin. This, along with other objects likely of West Asian origin indicates that the occupant likely maintained contact with Palestine, and as such the West Asian style Bes jug may have been manufactured there.

Painted storage jars depicting Bes have also been found in the site of Amarna dating to the late 18th Dynasty, in addition to a multitude of jars found in Deir el-Medina. In addition to these jars as well as aforementioned depictions on bedroom paraphernalia, faience baby bottles have been found in el-Lisht, further showing Bes as a protector of children.

Traces of &quot;Peganum harmala&quot;, and &quot;Nimphaea nouchali var. caerulea&quot; were identified in an Egyptian ritual Bes-vase, of the 2nd century BCE.

<text>A nautilus (, ) is any of the various species within the cephalopod family Nautilidae. This is the sole extant family of the superfamily Nautilaceae and the suborder Nautilina.

It comprises nine living species in two genera, the type of which is the genus &quot;Nautilus&quot;. Though it more specifically refers to the species &quot;Nautilus pompilius&quot;, the name chambered nautilus is also used for any of the Nautilidae. All are protected under CITES Appendix II. Depending on species, adult shell diameter is between .

The Nautilidae, both extant and extinct, are characterized by involute or more or less convoluted shells that are generally smooth, with compressed or depressed whorl sections, straight to sinuous sutures, and a tubular, generally central siphuncle. Having survived relatively unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, nautiluses represent the only living members of the subclass Nautiloidea, and are often considered &quot;living fossils&quot;.

The word nautilus is derived from the Greek word &quot;nautílos&quot; &quot;sailor&quot;, it originally referred to a type of octopus of the genus &quot;Argonauta&quot;, also known as &#x27;paper nautilus&#x27;, which were thought to use two of their arms as sails.

==Anatomy==
===Tentacles===
The arm crown of modern nautilids (genera &quot;Nautilus&quot; and &quot;Allonautilus&quot;) is very distinct in comparison to coleoids. Unlike the ten-armed Decabrachia or the eight-armed Octopodiformes, nautilus may possess any number of tentacles (cirri) from 50 to over 90 tentacles depending on the sex and individual. These tentacles are classified into three distinct categories: ocular, digital, and labial (buccal). There are two sets of ocular tentacles: one set in front of the eye (pre-ocular) and one set behind the eye (post-ocular). The digital and labial tentacles are arrayed circularly around the mouth, with the digital tentacles forming the outermost ring and the labial tentacles in between the digital tentacles and the mouth. There are 19 pairs of digital tentacles that, together with the ocular tentacles, make up the 42 appendages that are visible when observing the animal (not counting the modified tentacles that form the hood). The labial tentacles are generally not visible, being smaller than the digital tentacles, and more variable both in number and in shape. Males modify three of their labial tentacles into the spadix, which delivers spermatophores into the female during copulation.

The tentacle is composed of two distinct structures: the first structure, a fleshy sheath that contains the second structure: an extendable cirrus (plural: cirri). The sheaths of the digital tentacles are fused at their base into a single mass referred to as the cephalic sheath. The digital cirri can be fully withdrawn into the sheath and are highly flexible, capable of extending just over double their fully retracted length and show a high degree of allowable bendability and torsion. Despite not having suckers, the digital tentacles show strong adhesive capabilities. Adhesion is achieved through the secretion of a neutral (rather than acidic) mucopolysaccharide from secretory cells in the ridges of the digital cirri. Release is triggered through contraction of the tentacle musculature rather than the secretion of a chemical solvent, similar to the adhesion/release system in &quot;Euprymna&quot;, though it is unclear whether these adhesives are homologous. The ocular tentacles show no adhesive capability but operate as sensory organs. Both the ocular tentacles and the eight lateral digital tentacles show chemoreceptive abilities; the preocular tentacles detect distant odor and the lateral digital tentacles detect nearby odor.

===Digestive system===
The radula is wide and distinctively has nine teeth.

The mouth consists of a parrot-like beak made up of two interlocking jaws capable of ripping the animal&#x27;s food— mostly crustaceans— from the rocks to which they are attached. Males can be superficially differentiated from females by examining the arrangement of tentacles around the buccal cone: males have a spadix organ (shaped like a spike or shovel) located on the left side of the cone making the cone look irregular, whereas the buccal cone of the female is bilaterally symmetrical.

The crop is the largest portion of the digestive tract, and is highly extensible. From the crop, food passes to the small muscular stomach for crushing, and then goes past a digestive caecum before entering the relatively brief intestine.

===Circulatory system===
Like all cephalopods, the blood of the nautilus contains hemocyanin, which is blue in its oxygenated state. There are two pairs of gills which are the only remnants of the ancestral metamerism to be visible in extant cephalopods. Oxygenated blood arrives at the heart through four ventricles and flows out to the animal&#x27;s organs through distinct aortas but returns through veins which are too small and varied to be specifically described. The one exception to this is the vena cava, a single large vein running along the underside of the crop into which nearly all other vessels containing deoxygenated blood empty. All blood passes through one of the four sets of filtering organs (composed of one pericardial appendage and two renal appendages) upon leaving the vena cava and before arriving at the gills for re-oxygenation. Blood waste is emptied through a series of corresponding pores into the pallial cavity.

===Nervous system===
The central component of the nautilus nervous system is the oesophageal nerve ring which is a collection of ganglia, commissures, and connectives that together form a ring around the animal&#x27;s oesophagus. From this ring extend all of the nerves forward to the mouth, tentacles, and funnel; laterally to the eyes and rhinophores; and posteriorly to the remaining organs.

The nerve ring does not constitute what is typically considered a cephalopod &quot;brain&quot;: the upper portion of the nerve ring lacks differentiated lobes, and most of the nervous tissue appears to focus on finding and consuming food (i.e., it lacks a &quot;higher learning&quot; center). Nautili also tend to have rather short memory spans, and the nerve ring is not protected by any form of brain case.

===Shell===

Nautili are the sole living cephalopods whose bony body structure is externalized as a planispiral shell. The animal can withdraw completely into its shell and close the opening with a leathery hood formed from two specially folded tentacles. The shell is coiled, aragonitic, nacreous and pressure-resistant, imploding at a depth of about . The nautilus shell is composed of two layers: a matte white outer layer with dark orange stripes, and a striking white iridescent inner layer. The innermost portion of the shell is a pearlescent blue-gray. The osmeña pearl, contrarily to its name, is not a pearl, but a jewellery product derived from this part of the shell.

Internally, the shell divides into camerae (chambers), the chambered section being called the phragmocone. The divisions are defined by septa, each of which is pierced in the middle by a duct, the siphuncle. As the nautilus matures, it creates new, larger camerae and moves its growing body into the larger space, sealing the vacated chamber with a new septum. The camerae increase in number from around 4 at the moment of hatching to 30 or more in adults.

The shell coloration also keeps the animal cryptic in the water. When seen from above, the shell is darker in color and marked with irregular stripes, which helps it blend into the dark water below. The underside is almost completely white, making the animal indistinguishable from brighter waters near the surface. This mode of camouflage is called countershading.

The nautilus shell presents one of the finest natural examples of a logarithmic spiral, although it is not a golden spiral. The use of nautilus shells in art and literature is covered at nautilus shell.

===Size===
&quot;N. pompilius&quot; is the largest species in the genus. One form from Indonesia and northern Australia, once called &quot;N. repertus&quot;, may reach in diameter. However, most nautilus species never exceed . &quot;Nautilus macromphalus&quot; is the smallest species, usually measuring only . A dwarf population from the Sulu Sea (&quot;Nautilus pompilius suluensis&quot;) is even smaller, with a mean shell diameter of .

==Physiology==

===Buoyancy and movement===

To swim, the nautilus draws water into and out of the living chamber with its hyponome, which uses jet propulsion. This mode of propulsion is generally considered inefficient compared to propulsion with fins or undulatory locomotion, however, the nautilus has been found to be particularly efficient compared to other jet-propelled marine animals like squid and jellyfish, or even salmon at low speeds. It is thought that this is related to the use of asymmetrical contractile cycles and may be an adaptation to mitigate metabolic demands and protect against hypoxia when foraging at depth. While water is inside the chamber, the siphuncle extracts salt from it and diffuses it into the blood.

The animal adjusts its buoyancy only in long term density changes by osmosis, either removing liquid from its chambers or allowing water from the blood in the siphuncle to slowly refill the chambers. This is done in response to sudden changes in buoyancy that can occur with predatory attacks of fish, which can break off parts of the shell. This limits nautiluses in that they cannot operate under the extreme hydrostatic pressures found at depths greater than approximately , and in fact implode at about that depth, causing instant death. The gas also contained in the chambers is slightly below atmospheric pressure at sea level. The maximum depth at which they can regulate buoyancy by osmotic removal of chamber liquid is not known.

The nautilus has the extremely rare ability to withstand being brought to the surface from its deep natural habitat without suffering any apparent damage from the experience. Whereas fish or crustaceans brought up from such depths inevitably arrive dead, a nautilus will be unfazed despite the pressure change of as much as . The exact reasons for this ability, which is thought to be coincidental rather than specifically functional, are not known, though the perforated structure of the animal&#x27;s vena cava is thought to play an important role.

===Senses===
Unlike many other cephalopods, nautiluses do not have what many consider to be good vision; their eye structure is highly developed but lacks a solid lens. Whereas a sealed lens allows for the formation of highly focused and clear, detailed surrounding imagery, nautiluses have a simple pinhole eye open to the environment which only allows for the creation of correspondingly simple imagery.

Instead of vision, the animal is thought to use olfaction (smell) as the primary sense for foraging and for locating and identifying potential mates.

The &quot;ear&quot; of the nautilus consists of structures called &quot;otocysts&quot; located immediately behind the pedal ganglia near the nerve ring. They are oval structures densely packed with elliptical calcium carbonate crystals.

===Brain and intelligence===

Nautiluses are much closer to the first cephalopods that appeared about 500 million years ago than the early modern cephalopods that appeared maybe 100 million years later (ammonoids and coleoids). They have a seemingly simple brain, not the large complex brains of octopus, cuttlefish and squid, and had long been assumed to lack intelligence. But the cephalopod nervous system is quite different from that of other animals, and recent experiments have shown not only memory, but a changing response to the same event over time.

In a study in 2008, a group of nautiluses (&quot;N. pompilius&quot;) were given food as a bright blue light flashed until they began to associate the light with food, extending their tentacles every time the blue light was flashed. The blue light was again flashed without the food 3 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours later. The nautiluses continued to respond excitedly to the blue light for up to 30 minutes after the experiment. An hour later they showed no reaction to the blue light. However, between 6 and 12 hours after the training, they again responded to the blue light, but more tentatively. The researchers concluded that nautiluses had memory capabilities similar to the &quot;short-term&quot; and &quot;long-term memories&quot; of the more advanced cephalopods, despite having different brain structures. However, the long-term memory capability of nautiluses was much shorter than that of other cephalopods. The nautiluses completely forgot the earlier training 24 hours later, in contrast to octopuses, for example, which can remember conditioning for weeks afterwards. However, this may be simply the result of the conditioning procedure being suboptimal for sustaining long-term memories in nautiluses. Nevertheless, the study showed that scientists had previously underestimated the memory capabilities of nautiluses.

===Reproduction and lifespan===
Nautiluses reproduce by laying eggs. Gravid females attach the fertilized eggs, either singly or in small batches, to rocks in warmer waters (21–25 Celsius), whereupon the eggs take eight to twelve months to develop until the juveniles hatch. Females spawn once per year and regenerate their gonads, making nautiluses the only cephalopods to present iteroparity or polycyclic spawning.

Nautiluses are sexually dimorphic, in that males have four tentacles modified into an organ, called the &quot;spadix&quot;, which transfers sperm into the female&#x27;s mantle during mating. At sexual maturity, the male shell becomes slightly larger than the female&#x27;s. Males have been found to greatly outnumber females in practically all published studies, accounting for 60 to 94% of all recorded individuals at different sites.

The lifespan of nautiluses may exceed 20 years, which is exceptionally lengthy for a cephalopod, many of whom live less than three even in captivity and under ideal living conditions. However, nautiluses typically do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 15 years old, limiting their reproductive lifespan to often less than five years.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; male has a reproductive organ named Van der Hoeven&#x27;s organ. &quot;Nautilus&quot; female has two reproductive organs whose functions are unknown, the Organ of Valenciennes and Owen&#x27;s laminated organ.

==Ecology==

===Range and habitat===

Nautiluses are found only in the Indo-Pacific, from 30° N to 30° S latitude and 90° E to 175° E longitude. They inhabit the deep slopes of coral reefs.

Nautiluses usually inhabit depths of several hundred metres. It has long been believed that nautiluses rise at night to feed, mate, and lay eggs, but it appears that, in at least some populations, the vertical movement patterns of these animals are far more complex. The greatest depth at which a nautilus has been sighted is (&quot;N. pompilius&quot;). Implosion depth for nautilus shells is thought to be around . Only in New Caledonia, the Loyalty Islands, and Vanuatu can nautiluses be observed in very shallow water, at depths of as little as . This is due to the cooler surface waters found in these southern hemisphere habitats as compared to the many equatorial habitats of other nautilus populations – these usually being restricted to depths greater than . Nautiluses generally avoid water temperatures above .

While nautiloids were once common worldwide, their numbers declined and their distribution became restricted to their current habitats during the Pleistocene, largely due to the diversification of pinnipeds. 

===Diet===
Nautiluses are scavengers and opportunistic predators. They eat lobster molts, hermit crabs, and carrion of any kind.

==Evolutionary history==
Fossil records indicate that nautiloids have experienced minimal morphological changes over the past 500 million years. Many were initially straight-shelled, as in the extinct genus &quot;Lituites&quot;. They developed in the Late Cambrian period and became a significant group of sea predators during the Ordovician period. Certain species reached over in size. The other cephalopod subclass, Coleoidea, diverged from the nautiloids long ago and the nautilus has remained relatively unchanged since. Nautiloids were much more extensive and varied 200 million years ago. The ancestors of all Coleoidea (shell-less Cephalopods) once possessed shells, and many early cephalopod species are only known from shell remains. Following the K-Pg extinction event most nautiloid species went extinct, while members of Coleoidea managed to survive. Following the mass extinction, the nautilus became the only extant species of nautiloids.

The family Nautilidae has its origin in the Trigonocerataceae (Centroceratina), specifically in the Syringonautilidae of the Late Triassic and continues to this day with &quot;Nautilus&quot;, the type genus, and its close relative, &quot;Allonautilus&quot;.

===Fossil genera===

The fossil record of Nautilidae begins with &quot;Cenoceras&quot; in the Late Triassic, a highly varied genus that makes up the Jurassic &quot;Cenoceras&quot; complex. &quot;Cenoceras&quot; is evolute to involute, and globular to lentincular; with a suture that generally has a shallow ventral and lateral lobe and a siphuncle that is variable in position but never extremely ventral or dorsal. &quot;Cenoceras&quot; is not found above the Middle Jurassic and is followed by the Upper Jurassic-Miocene &quot;Eutrephoceras&quot;.

&quot;Eutrephoceras&quot; is generally subglobular, broadly rounded laterally and ventrally, with a small to occluded umbilicus, broadly rounded hyponomic sinus, only slightly sinuous sutures, and a small siphuncle that is variable in position.

Next to appear is the Lower Cretaceous &quot;Strionautilus&quot; from India and the European ex-USSR, named by Shimankiy in 1951. &quot;Strionautilus&quot; is compressed, involute, with fine longitudinal striations. Whorl sections are subrectangular, sutures sinuous, the siphuncle subcentral.

Also from the Cretaceous is &quot;Pseudocenoceras&quot;, named by Spath in 1927. &quot;Pseudocenoceras&quot; is compressed, smooth, with subrectangular whorl sections, flattened venter, and a deep umbilicus. The suture crosses the venter essentially straight and has a broad, shallow, lateral lobe. The siphuncle is small and subcentral. &quot;Pseudocenoceras&quot; is found in the Crimea and in Libya.

&quot;Carinonautilus&quot; is a genus from the Upper Cretaceous of India, named by Spengler in 1919. &quot;Carinonautilus&quot; is a very involute form with high whorl section and flanks that converge on a narrow venter that bears a prominent rounded keel. The umbilicus is small and shallow, the suture only slightly sinuous. The siphuncle is unknown.

&quot;Obinautilus&quot; has also been placed in Nautilidae by some authorities, though it may instead be an argonautid octopus.

==Taxonomy==

The family Nautilidae contains up to nine extant species and several extinct species:

*Genus Allonautilus
**&quot;A. perforatus&quot;
**&quot;A. scrobiculatus&quot;
*Genus Nautilus
**†&quot;N. altifrons&quot;
**†&quot;N. balcombensis&quot;
**&quot;N. belauensis&quot;
**†&quot;N. butonensis&quot;
**†&quot;N. campbelli&quot;
**†&quot;N. cookanus&quot;
**†&quot;N. geelongensis&quot;
**†&quot;N. javanus&quot;
**&quot;N. macromphalus&quot;
**&quot;N. pompilius&quot; (type)
***&quot;N. p. pompilius&quot;
***&quot;N. p. suluensis&quot;
**†&quot;N. praepompilius&quot;
** &quot;Nautilus samoaensis&quot; – Samoa
**&quot;N. stenomphalus&quot;
**†&quot;Nautilus taiwanus&quot; – Taiwan
**&quot;Nautilus vanuatuensis&quot; – Vanuatu
**&quot;Nautilus vitiensis&quot; – Fiji

Genetic data collected in 2011 pointed to there being only three extant species: &quot;A. scrobiculatus&quot;, &quot;N. macromphalus&quot;, and &quot;N. pompilius&quot;, with &quot;N. belauensis&quot; and &quot;N. stenomphalus&quot; both subsumed under &quot;N. pompilius&quot;, possibly as subspecies, though this was prior to the description of three additional species (&quot;samoaensis&quot;, &quot;vanuatuensis&quot; and &quot;vitiensis&quot;).

===Dubious or uncertain taxa===
The following taxa associated with the family Nautilidae are of uncertain taxonomic status:

== Conservation status and human use ==
Nautilus are collected or fished for sale as live animals or to carve the shells for souvenirs and collectibles, not for just the shape of their shells, but also the nacreous inner shell layer, which is used as a pearl substitute. In Samoa, nautilus shells decorate the forehead band of a traditional headdress called &quot;tuiga&quot;. Nautilus shells were popular items in the Renaissance and Baroque cabinet of curiosities and were often mounted by goldsmiths on a thin stem to make extravagant nautilus shell cups.

The low fecundity, late maturity, long gestation period and long life-span of nautiluses suggest that these species are vulnerable to overexploitation and demand for the ornamental shell is causing population declines. The threats from trade in these shells has led to countries such as Indonesia legally protecting the chambered nautilus with fines of up to US$8,500 and/or 5 years in prison for trading in this species. Despite their legal protection, these shells were reported to be openly sold at tourist areas in Bali as of 2014. The continued trade of these animals has led to a call for increased protection and in 2016 all species in Family Nautilidae were added to CITES Appendix II, regulating international trade.

==In human culture==
Palauans see nautili () as a symbol of vulnerable or fragile character from a belief that they easily die even from slight bumps on ocean rocks; hence someone who gets quickly angry after being pranked is compared to one ().

<doc id="97348" wikidata="Q372560" url="?curid=97348" title="Wepwawet">
<text>In Egyptian mythology, Wepwawet (hieroglyphic &quot;wp-w3w.t&quot;; also rendered Upuaut, Wep-wawet, Wepawet, Apuat, and Ophois) was originally a jackal deity of funerary rites, war, and royalty, whose cult centre was Asyut in Upper Egypt (Lycopolis in the Greco-Roman period). His name means &quot;opener of the ways&quot; and he is often depicted as a wolf standing at the prow of a solar-boat. Some interpret that Wepwawet was seen as a scout, going out to clear routes for the army to proceed forward. One inscription from the Sinai states that Wepwawet &quot;opens the way&quot; to king Sekhemkhet&#x27;s victory. In royal and religious processions, Wepwawet was often depicted on the first standard, opening the way for subsequent standards. He also stands at the prow of the Barque of Ra, usually in human-headed form.

Wepwawet originally was seen as a jackal, or, according to some, a wolf deity, with his cult center being at the &quot;Lycopolis&quot;, (meaning &quot;city of wolves&quot; in Greek). He is one of the earliest Egyptian Gods on record. Wepwawet was heavily seen in association with royalty and the Pharaoh (&quot;My face is that of Wepwawet&quot;, Pyramid Texts), symbolizing and protecting their rise to power, accompanying them on hunts (in which capacity he was titled &quot;[one with] sharp arrows more powerful than the gods alone)&quot; or in the pharaoh&#x27;s ascent to the Duat, or afterlife.

Over time, the connection to war and thus to death led to Wepwawet also being seen as one who opened the ways to, and through, Duat, for the spirits of the dead. Through this, Wepwawet became associated with Anubis, a deity that was worshiped in Asyut, eventually being considered his brother. 

The Pyramid Texts state that Wepwawet was born in the Peru-nu, the sacred shrine of the goddess Wadjet, while an alternative myth suggests he emerged from a tamarisk bush. Consequently, Wepwawet is often confused with Anubis. This deity appears in the Temple of Seti I at Abydos.

In Egyptian art, Wepwawet was depicted as a black jackal, or as a man with the head of a jackal. In the temple of Seti I at Abydos, Wepwawet appears to have grey-colored fur, though this is likely due to loss of pigmentation, as elsewhere in the temple, black paint is almost entirely faded. In rare cases, he appears in fully human form.

He was sometimes depicted dressed as a soldier, as well as carrying other military equipment—a mace and a bow.

For what generally is considered to be lauding purposes of the pharaohs, a later myth briefly was circulated claiming that Wepwawet was born at the sanctuary of Wadjet, the sacred site for the oldest goddess of Lower Egypt that is located in the heart of Lower Egypt. Consequently, Wepwawet, who had hitherto been the standard of Upper Egypt alone, formed an integral part of royal rituals, symbolizing the unification of Egypt.

In later Pyramid Texts, Wepwawet is called &quot;Ra&quot; who has gone up from the horizon, perhaps as the &quot;opener&quot; of the sky. In the later Egyptian funerary context, Wepwawet assists at the Opening of the mouth ceremony and guides the deceased into the netherworld.

==In popular culture==
In &quot;Crusader Kings III&quot;, God Wepwawet is the supreme deity of the Kordofan faith.

Wepwawet is the personal god or totem of Thu, the main character in the &quot;Lady of the Reeds&quot; books by Canadian author Pauline Gedge (House of Dreams, 1994; and House of Illusions, 1996).

==Animal origin==

While we do not know for certain the exact species of animal represented by the Ancient Egyptian &quot;sꜢb&quot; / sAb animal (&quot;Jackal&quot;), the African wolf (&quot;Canis lupaster&quot;) was one species thought to depict and the template of numerous Ancient Egyptian deities, including Wepwawet. Other species theorized include the black-backed jackal also called the silver-backed Jackal (&quot;C. mesomelas&quot; or &quot;Lupulella mesomelas&quot;) and golden jackal or Asiatic jackal (&quot;Canis aureus&quot;).

The Egyptian jackal was listed as a subspecies of the golden jackal but molecular and osteological data has established that it is a unique species in its own right. It is native to Egypt, Libya, and Ethiopia, though its post-Pleistocene range once encompassed the Palestine region.

Inter-breeding between species also cannot be ruled out, and it has been posited that a species sharing the characteristics of both African jackal and wolf species could be the missing link, such as the combination of &quot;C. aureas&quot; and &quot;C. lupus lupaster&quot; appearing as &quot;Canis aureus lupaster&quot;.

<doc id="97350" wikidata="Q146007" url="?curid=97350" title="Wadjet">
<text>Wadjet (; &quot;Green One&quot;), known to the Greek world as Uto (; ) or Buto (; ) among other renderings including Wedjat, Uadjet, and Udjo, was originally the ancient Egyptian local goddess of the city of Dep or Buto in Lower Egypt, which was an important site in prehistoric Egypt. Wadjet&#x27;s worship originally started in the Predynastic period, but evolved over time from a local goddess to a patron goddess.

Wadjet was closely associated in ancient Egyptian religion with the Eye of Ra and the Eye of Horus symbols, each powerful protective deities. The hieroglyph for her eye is shown below; sometimes two are shown in the sky of religious images. There is little consensus on which eye is truly tied to Wadjet as both have some importance to her. The main differences between her eyes are which side of the face they are on, left or right. The color of these eyes in amulets and ceramics are usually created in vibrant blue and green colors, which resemble the goddess&#x27;s name of &quot;the green one&quot;. The green Wadjet eye amulets found in Egyptian daily life provided a token of fertility and protection to those who had them.

== Etymology ==
The name Wadjet is derived from the term for the symbol of her domain, Lower Egypt, the &quot;papyrus&quot;. Its hieroglyphs differ from those of the Green Crown or Deshret of Lower Egypt only by the determinative, which in the case of the crown was a picture of the Green Crown and, in the case of the goddess, a rearing cobra. The transliteration of the various eyes that Wadjet is associated with (Wedjat-eye) refers to the name the &quot;Intact-one&quot;. Wadjet&#x27;s name ends with a T, signifying her being a feminine presence rather than a male presence that some claim she is. Other names for Wadjet include: Wedjat, Wadjit, Wadjyt, Uto, Buto, Uatchet, and Edjo.

== History ==
Wadjet was said to be the matron and protector of Lower Egypt in her cobra form, and upon unification with her sister Nekhbet, Goddess of Upper Egypt, the joint protector and patron of all of Egypt. Scenes of the two sisters together as two cobras can be found in King Sety I&#x27;s tomb, located in the Valley of the Kings. The image of Wadjet with the sun disk is called the uraeus, and it was the emblem on the crown of the rulers of Lower Egypt. She was also the protector of kings and of women in childbirth, tasked with guarding them from enemies that could harm them.

Wadjet&#x27;s family history is largely unconfirmed, mainly found through myth and word of mouth. In one myth, Wadjet was said to be Ra&#x27;s Daughter, where she was depicted as his seeing eye. Her job was to find Shu and Tefnut for him, to which she successfully did. Her father was very proud of her and honored her by commanding that she stay with him to protect him from enemies. She took her most recognizable form as a snake and struck any enemies that tried to hurt her father. She was also in charge of carrying out Ra&#x27;s orders. This myth is represented by triadic seals, amulets, and more, depicting the family of gods together, including Ra as the father, Wadjet as the daughter, and Seth as Ra&#x27;s bodyguard. A clear example of these three gods being tied together was found on a Triad amulet in Tel Azekah, closer to Jerusalem, Israel.

In another myth, Wadjet was said to be the nurse of the infant god Horus. With the help of his mother Isis, they protected Horus from his treacherous uncle, Set, when they took refuge in the swamps of the Nile Delta.

Wadjet and Nekhbet have been portrayed as nurses to the various kings in the afterlife, breastfeeding him in order to sustain his royal qualities. These two goddesses appear in the Pyramid Texts, maintaining the king&#x27;s divinity through suckling while he is in a child-like state. A similar portrayal of Wadjet as a nurse, found in the tomb of Tutankhamun on a pendant, instead depicts the King as fully grown and standing straight up while being breastfed. He is dressed in his traditional royal attire, using the Goddess&#x27;s milk to help him be successful in his position of king. This pendant of Wadjet and the king was found in the context of funerary rituals and could serve multiple purposes of both resurrection and coronation. This imagery is also found in King Pepy II&#x27;s funerary temple, which shows a damaged relief of Wadjet nursing the king.

Wadjet&#x27;s oracle was in the renowned temple in Per-Wadjet that was dedicated to her worship and gave the city its name. This oracle may have been the source for the oracular tradition that spread to Greece from Egypt.
From around the 4th dynasty onward, Wadjet was claimed as the patron goddess and protector of the whole of Lower Egypt. She became associated with Nekhbet, depicted as a white vulture, who held unified Egypt. After the unification the image of Nekhbet joined Wadjet on the crown, thereafter shown as part of the uraeus. The religious epithet for these patron deities of the entire county was, &quot;nebty (&#x27;Two Ladies&#x27;)&quot;.

Wadjet, as the goddess of Lower Egypt, had a large temple at the ancient Imet (now Tell Nebesha) in the Nile Delta. She was worshipped in the area as the &quot;Lady of Imet&quot;. Later she was joined by Min and Horus to form a triad of deities. From the site of Tebtunis, in the Egyptian Faiyum, a temple is dedicated to Wadjet and was the site of ritual performance in her honor.

According to ancient Greece, Wadjet was present in their mythology as well. Known as Buto, Uto, Leto or Latona, the goddess was one of the focal points for the town of Buto, as mentioned above.

== Appearance ==
The Egyptian word &quot;wꜣḏ&quot; signifies blue and green. It is also the name for the well-known &quot;Eye of the Moon&quot;. Wadjet was usually depicted as an Egyptian cobra, a venomous snake common to the region. In later times, she was often depicted simply as a woman with a snake&#x27;s head, a woman wearing the uraeus, or a lion headed goddess often wearing the uraeus. The uraeus originally had been her body alone, which wrapped around or was coiled upon the head of the pharaoh or another deity. In her snake form, she was depicted as striking and biting those who try to harm the King, which is why she is featured as a protective symbol on crown emblems and amulets. Wadjet is also depicted as an Egyptian cobra with large, colorful wings. She is shown in her signature green and blue colors on the snake hood and wing feathers, but she is also shown with vibrant red and gold colors that scale down to the snake&#x27;s tail. Gold commonly represented the gods and goddesses eternal flesh, while red represented danger and fire to signify something as a threat. A decorative panel depicting Wadjet&#x27;s cobras was found in the Maru-Aten Temple in a darker colored granite. This darkened material helps historians infer that a yellow quartzite color was present, representing the color of the sun and the eternal flesh.

Later Wadjet often was shown coiled upon the head of Ra; in order to act as his protector, this image of her became the uraeus symbol used on the royal crowns as well.Another early depiction of Wadjet is as a cobra entwined around a papyrus stem, beginning in the Predynastic era (prior to 3100 B.C.) and it is thought to be the first image that shows a snake entwined around a staff symbol. This is a sacred image that appeared repeatedly in the later images and myths of cultures surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, called the caduceus, which may have had separate origins. Her image also rears up from the staff of the &quot;flagpoles&quot; that are used to indicate deities, as seen in the hieroglyph for &quot;uraeus&quot; and for &quot;goddess&quot; in other places.

Similar to her sister, Nekhbet, Wadjet can also be found in the form of a vulture. It is less common to find her in this form as her cobra form is more popular in order to represent protection. However some reliefs do depict Wadjet in her avian form hovering over the heads of kings and pharaohs.

Wadjet is occasionally depicted as other animal headed beings or depicted as other animals such as a lion, mongoose, Ichneumonidae. Notably the depiction of the mongoose serves as an antithesis to that of the cobra as it is a natural predator. While the Icheumon probably serves as a depiction of Wedjat&#x27;s role in seeing for Horus. Many bronze statues of Wadjet are argued to contain Icheumon remains however confirmation on this being forensic or a visual observation is unknown.

When Wadjet is depicted as a lion, she is usually seated in the bronze statues that represent her. She is in a relaxed position with her mouth closed and her arms at her side, which is very different from her other depictions as a snake rearing at enemies. An explanation for her depiction as a lion headed goddess may stem from the goddess Sekhmet through association as a powerful or dangerous goddess. Some historians are not sure that these bronze statues are of Wadjet, but instead of the goddess Sekhmet.

At times she was depicted wearing the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. Wadjet was depicted many times in her cobra form alongside her Upper Egyptian counterpart Nekhbet, in her vulture form wearing the Red Crown on wall paintings or on the pharaoh&#x27;s headdress.

In the relief shown in the gallery, which is on the wall of the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut at Luxor, there are two images of Wadjet: one of her as the Uraeus with her head through an ankh and another where she precedes a Horus hawk wearing the pschent, representing the pharaoh whom she protects.

== Protector of country, pharaohs, and other deities ==
Wadjet was associated with the Nile Delta region and was more associated with the world of the living. She was closely linked to pharaohs as a protective deity.

Wadjet is found in several different burial sites of both Kings and Queens in order to symbolize protection. Notably, she is found in Queen consort Nefertari&#x27;s tomb in a rearing position wearing a double crown, or Pschent. The Pschent depicts the unity of Lower and Upper Egypt into one. These crowns are usually found in the tombs of royalty in order to show control over the entirety of Egypt. Along with her double crown, Wadjet is posed holding a Was-sceptre, a valued symbol of authority or divine power. All of these sacred items Wadjet is posed with help to provide protection over the royal family, and in this case, the royal family is of King Ramsses II and Queen consort Nefertari.

Aside from Nefertari&#x27;s tomb, Wadjet is also found in King Sety I&#x27;s Tomb, along with her sister Nekhbet. The two sisters are seen on each side of King Sety&#x27;s name, providing full protection to him as he rules over Egypt. The unification of the sisters shows Sety I&#x27;s control over all of Egypt, not just of Lower or Upper Egypt.Wadjet, as mentioned above, is often depicted as a winged cobra. These wings serving a dual purpose as a protective embrace and being capable of creating the breath of life often connected to the image of the Ankh that she is often depicted with. Both of these uses are vital in surviving the afterlife.

From the Temple of Kom Ombo an engraving depicts surgical equipment among which is a set of Wadjet eyes denoting its uses as a medical item and Wadjet&#x27;s role as a protector deity. Within the wider relief it contains a depiction of a Roman pharaoh offering the Wadjet Eyes to Haroeris and Senetneferet (meaning the good sister), his consort. While only the lower portion of the relief remains, its inscription describes the pharaoh&#x27;s desire for Haroeris to cleanse the eyes symbolizing the two halves of Egypt and in turn restore Egypt itself. Once again this denotes Wadjet&#x27;s role as a protector and unifier of Egypt.

== Wadjet in Modern Media ==
Like many aspects of Egyptology, mass media tends to incorporate Egyptian influences into video games, movies and much more. Wadjet is no exception to this rule and is referenced in countless different forms of modern media.
* Wadjet&#x27;s symbolism through the Eye of Ra appears in the video game &quot;Overwatch 2&quot; underneath the character &quot;Pharah&#x27;s&quot; eye.
* Wadjet&#x27;s symbolism through the Eye of Horus appears in the video game &quot;Overwatch 2&quot; underneath the character &quot;Ana (Overwatch)&quot;&#x27;s eye.
* Wadjet appears as the protector of Lower Egypt in &quot;The Crown of Ptolemy&quot; (March 31, 2015), by Rick Riordan.
* Wadjet&#x27;s symbolism as the Eye of Horus appears within the quest, &quot;The Curse of Wadjet&quot;, in the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins&quot;.
* Wadjet appears in the board game Wadjet (board game) (1996), where she attempts to stop the explorers (players) from entering her tomb.
* Wadjet appears as a playable unit in Age of Mythology (2002) for the Egyptian Faction

== Other uses ==
The Nazit Mons, a mountain on Venus, is named for Nazit, an &quot;Egyptian winged serpent goddess&quot;. According to Elizabeth Goldsmith, the Greek name for Nazit was Buto.

<text>Buto (, , &quot;Butu&quot;), Bouto, Butus (, &quot;Boutos&quot;) or Butosus was a city that the Ancient Egyptians called Per-Wadjet. It was located 95 km east of Alexandria in the Nile Delta of Egypt. What in classical times the Greeks called Buto, stood about midway between the Taly (Bolbitine) and Thermuthiac (Sebennytic) branches of the Nile, a few kilometers north of the east-west Butic River and on the southern shore of the Butic Lake (, &quot;Boutikē limnē&quot;).

Today, it is called Tell El Fara&#x27;in (&quot;Hill of the Pharaohs&quot;), near the villages of Ibtu (or Abtu), Kom Butu, and the city of [[Desouk]] ().

== History ==
Buto was a sacred site in dedication to the goddess Wadjet. It was an important cultural site during prehistoric Egypt (before 3100 BCE). 

The Buto-Maadi culture was the most important Lower Egyptian prehistoric culture, dating from 4000–3500 BC, and contemporary with Naqada I and II phases in Upper Egypt. The culture was best known from the site Maadi near Cairo, but was also attested in many other places in the Delta to the Faiyum region. This culture was marked by development in architecture and technology.

Archaeological evidence shows that the Upper Egyptian Naqada culture replaced the Buto-Maadi culture (also known as the &quot;Lower Egyptian Cultural Complex&quot;), perhaps after a conquest. More recently, scholars have expressed reservations about this; they pointed out that, in the Delta, there was a considerable transitional phase.

The unification of Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt into one entity is now considered to be a more complex process than previously thought.

=== Earliest texts ===

In the earliest records about the region, it contained two cities, Pe and Dep. Eventually, they merged into one city that the Ancient Egyptians named Per-Wadjet.

The goddess Wadjet was the patron deity of Lower Egypt and her oracle was located in her renowned temple in this area. An annual festival was held there that celebrated Wadjet. The area also contained sanctuaries of Horus and Bast, and much later, the city became associated with Isis.

Due to similarities, many deities had parallel identities and roles and merged into a unified pantheon of deities. That was not the case with patron deities, however. The patron deity of Lower Egypt, Wadjet, was represented as a cobra. The patron deity of Upper Egypt, Nekhbet, was depicted as a white vulture. Their separate cultural statures were such essential features that they never merged when the two cultures unified. There were so many deities with similar roles or natures from the religious beliefs of the two unified regions. The two goddesses became known euphemistically as the Two Ladies, who together, remained the patrons of unified Egypt throughout the remainder of its ancient history. The image of Nekhbet joined Wadjet on the uraeus encircling the crown of the kings who ruled Egypt after that.

=== Ptolemaic period ===
During the Ptolemaic Kingdom, a Greek-speaking dynasty that ruled from 305 to 30 BCE, the Greeks coined the toponym &quot;Buto&quot; for the city. It served as the capital, or according to Herodian, merely the principal village of the Delta. Herodotus styled it the Chemmite nome, Ptolemy knew it as the Phthenothite nome (), and Pliny the Elder as Ptenetha.

Greek historians recorded that Buto was celebrated for its monolithic temple and the oracle of the goddess Wadjet (Buto), and a yearly festival was held there in honour of the goddess. While writing about Egyptian culture, the classical Greeks attempted to associate the more ancient Egyptian deities with their own, a process called the interpretatio graeca. They wrote about them as essentially the same deities but with different names in Greek culture. For Wadjet, the parallel identification was made with Leto or Latona. They also noted that at Buto, there was a sanctuary of Horus, whom the Greeks associated with Apollo, and a sanctuary of Bastet, who the Greeks associated with Artemis.

Writing during that Graeco-Roman period, Plutarch reported that Isis had entrusted the baby Horus to &quot;Leto&quot; (Wadjet) to raise at Buto while Isis searched for the body of her murdered husband Osiris. According to these same late sources, the shrew (sometimes associated with Horus) was worshiped at Buto as well.

=== Archeological findings ===
A palace building dating to the Second Dynasty is considered one of the most important discoveries within Buto. Archaeological excavations were undertaken at Buto by the Egypt Exploration Society from 1964–1969, under the direction of Veronica Seton-Williams and later, by Dorothy Charlesworth. The German Archaeological Institute, Cairo has been excavating at Buto since the early 1980s. Six Greek bathhouses also were excavated by different missions in Buto.

In 2022, excavations over an area of 6.5m x 4.5m uncovered the remains of an ancient hall lined with pillars within the larger temple structure. The hall contained the remains of three surviving columns, aligned on a north-south axis at the southwestern end of the temple. A number of stone fragments decorated with engravings where found, as well as numerous ceramics and pottery associated with ritual activity. In a press release issued by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, archaeologists also found a limestone painting with the representation of a bird’s head wearing a white crown surrounded by feathers.

<text>Nekhbet (; also spelt Nekhebit) is an early predynastic local goddess in Egyptian mythology, who was the patron of the city of Nekheb (her name meaning &quot;of Nekheb&quot;). Ultimately, she became the patron of Upper Egypt and one of the two patron deities (alongside Wadjet) for all of Ancient Egypt when it was unified.

==Mythology==
One of Egypt&#x27;s earliest temples was the shrine of Nekhbet at Nekheb (also referred to as El Kab). It was the companion city to Nekhen, the religious and political capital of Upper Egypt, at the end of the Predynastic period (c. 3200–3100 BC) and probably, also during the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3100–2686 BC). The original settlement on the Nekhen site dates from Naqada I or the late Badarian cultures. At its height, from about 3400 BC, Nekhen had at least 5,000 and possibly as many as 10,000 inhabitants.

Nekhbet was the tutelary deity of Upper Egypt. Nekhbet and her Lower Egyptian counterpart Wadjet often appeared together as the &quot;Two Ladies&quot;. One of the titles of each ruler was the &quot;Nebty&quot; name, which began with the hieroglyphs for &quot;[s/he] of the Two Ladies...&quot;.

== Iconography ==

In art, Nekhbet was depicted as a vulture. Alan Gardiner identified the species that was used in divine iconography as a griffon vulture. Arielle P. Kozloff, however, argues that the vultures in New Kingdom art, with their blue-tipped beaks and loose skin, better resemble the lappet-faced vulture.

In New Kingdom times, the vulture appeared alongside the uraeus on the headdresses with which kings were buried. The uraeus and vulture are traditionally interpreted as Wadjet and Nekhbet, but Edna R. Russmann has suggested that in this context they represent Isis and Nephthys, two major funerary goddesses, instead.

Nekhbet usually was depicted hovering, with her wings spread above the royal image, clutching a shen symbol (representing eternal encircling protection), frequently in her claws.

Depictions of animal deities start with the animal being depicted directly. Later the animal appears in human form, but still with an animal head. Individual deities continue into historical times (post 3000 BC) to often be described in their original animal form: e.g., Horus (Falcon), Wadjet (cobra) and Nekhbet (vulture).

==In popular culture==

*Nekhbet is a bird-like monster in &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;.
*Nekhbet appears in Rick Riordan&#x27;s &quot;The Throne of Fire&quot; as a minor antagonist.
*Nekhbet is the name of a pet vulture in the anime &quot;Tenshi ni Narumon&quot;.
*Nekhbet is an ascending goddess in the Dungeon Crawler Carl series.

<text>Nautilus is the fictional submarine belonging to Captain Nemo featured in Jules Verne&#x27;s novels &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; (1870) and &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; (1875).

== Description ==
&quot;Nautilus&quot; is described by Verne as &quot;a masterpiece containing masterpieces&quot;. It is designed and commanded by Captain Nemo. Electricity provided by sodium/mercury electric batteries (with the sodium provided by extraction from seawater) is the craft&#x27;s primary power source for propulsion and other services. The energy needed to extract the sodium is provided by coal mined from the sea floor.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; is double-hulled, and is further separated into water-tight compartments. Its top speed is . In Captain Nemo&#x27;s own words:

&quot;Nautilus&quot; uses floodable tanks in order to adjust buoyancy and so control its depth. The pumps that evacuate these tanks of water are so powerful that they produce large jets of water when the vessel emerges rapidly from the surface of the water. This leads many early observers of &quot;Nautilus&quot; to believe that the vessel is some species of marine mammal, or perhaps a sea monster not yet known to science. To submerge deeply in a short time, &quot;Nautilus&quot; uses a technique called &quot;hydroplaning&quot;, in which the vessel dives down at a steep angle.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; supports a crew that gathers food from the sea. &quot;Nautilus&quot; includes a galley for preparing these foods, which includes a machine that makes drinking water from seawater through distillation. &quot;Nautilus&quot; is not able to refresh its air supply, so Captain Nemo designed it to do this by surfacing and exchanging stale air for fresh, much like a whale. &quot;Nautilus&quot; is capable of extended voyages without refueling or otherwise restocking supplies. Its maximum dive time is around five days.

Much of the ship is decorated to standards of luxury that are unequalled in a seagoing vessel of the time. These include a library containing about twelve thousand books, with boxed collections of valuable oceanic specimens. The library is also filled with expensive paintings and other works of art. &quot;Nautilus&quot; also features a lavish dining room and even an organ that Captain Nemo uses to entertain himself in the evening. By comparison, Nemo&#x27;s personal quarters are very sparsely furnished but do feature duplicates of the bridge instruments so that the captain can keep track of the vessel without being present on the bridge. These amenities however, are only available to Nemo, Professor Aronnax, and his companions.

From her attacks on ships, using a ramming prow to puncture target vessels below the waterline, the world thinks it a sea monster, but later identifies it as an underwater vessel capable of great destructive power, after &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; is attacked and Ned Land strikes the metallic surface of &quot;Nautilus&quot; with his harpoon.

Its parts were built to order by companies including Creusot and Cail &amp; Co. in France, Pen &amp; Co. and Laird&#x27;s in England, Scott&#x27;s in Scotland, Krupp in Prussia, the Motala workshops in Sweden, and Hart Bros. in the United States. Each part was ordered by Nemo anonymously under a different address. Then they were assembled by Nemo&#x27;s men on a desert island. &quot;Nautilus&quot; returned to this island, where Nemo later helped castaways in the novel &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;. After Nemo dies on board, the volcanic island erupts, entombing the Captain and &quot;Nautilus&quot; for eternity.

== Inspirations ==

Verne named the &quot;Nautilus&quot; after Robert Fulton&#x27;s real-life submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot; (1800). For the design of the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, Verne was inspired by the French Navy submarine &quot;Plongeur&quot;, a model of which he had seen at the 1867 Exposition Universelle, three years before writing his novel.

A number of authors have identified a possible link between the Birkenhead, England built CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; and Captain Nemo&#x27;s &quot;Nautilus&quot;. The CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; was a warship built in secrecy for the Confederate States by Lairds shipyard of Birkenhead, England in the American Civil War. Butcher stated, &quot;The &quot;Alabama&quot;, which claimed to have sunk 75 merchantmen, was destroyed by the Unionist &quot;Kearsarge&quot; off Cherbourg on 11 June 1864... This battle has clear connections with Nemo&#x27;s final attack, also in the English Channel.&quot; Jules Verne had himself made a previous comparison between the Birkenhead built CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; and the &quot;Nautilus&quot; in a letter to his publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel in March 1869.

==Notable appearances==

Beside their original appearances in &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; and &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;, &quot;Nautilus&quot; and Captain Nemo have appeared in numerous other works.

In the 1954 film adaptation of the first novel and in &quot;The Return of Captain Nemo&quot;, it is suggested that &quot;Nautilus&quot; is powered by nuclear energy (discovered by Nemo himself), and that Nemo uses the same energy to destroy Vulcania, &quot;Nautilus&quot;&#x27;s base island.

In the 1969 film &quot;Captain Nemo and the Underwater City&quot;, &quot;Nautilus&quot; and its sister ship &quot;Nautilus II&quot; are depicted as industrialised stingray-like vessels, flattened with pronounced tumblehomes supporting rounded deckhouses. Each has a heavy girderwork tail, at the tip of which twin rudders and diving planes are mounted.

In Kevin J. Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius&quot;, &quot;Nautilus&quot; appears as a real submarine, apparently cigar-shaped like the one from the novel, built by Nemo for the Ottoman Empire.

In Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;Nautilus&quot; features with a squid-like appearance in the graphic novel and a more traditional – albeit extremely tall – submarine in the film. Toward the closing stages of the film, antagonist &quot;The Fantom&quot; has stolen Nemo&#x27;s design and begun construction of multiple submarines dubbed &quot;Nautili&quot; by Skinner. In the film adaptation, the &quot;Nautilus&quot; is called the sword of the ocean by Nemo.

The Nautilus is also featured in the &quot;Rick Riordan&quot; young adult novel &quot;Daughter of the Deep&quot;. The book is set in the world of 20,000 Leagues, but six generations after the events described in Jules Verne&#x27;s book.

== Other Verne submarines ==
Submarines feature in some other of Verne&#x27;s works. In the 1896 novel &quot;Facing the Flag&quot;, the pirate Ker Karraje uses an unnamed submarine that acts both as a tug to his schooner &quot;Ebba&quot; and for ramming and destroying ships which are the targets of his piracy. The same book also features HMS &quot;Sword&quot;, a small Royal Navy experimental submarine which is sunk after a valiant but unequal struggle with the pirate submarine. In the 1904 book &quot;The Master of the World&quot;, Robur&#x27;s secondary vehicle, &quot;Terror&quot;, is a strange flying machine with submarine, automobile and speedboat capabilities. It briefly eludes naval forces on the Great Lakes by diving.

<doc id="97367" wikidata="Q287542" url="?curid=97367" title="Robert C. Merton">
<text>Robert Cox Merton (born July 31, 1944) is an American economist, Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureate, and professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, known for his pioneering contributions to continuous-time finance, especially the first continuous-time option pricing model, the Black–Scholes–Merton model.
In 1997 Merton together with Myron Scholes were awarded the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel for the method to determine the value of derivatives.

Merton was on the board of directors of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a highly leveraged hedge fund that collapsed in 1998, wiping out most of the value paid in by the investors, and requiring a $3.6 billion bailout from a group of 14 banks, in a deal brokered and put together by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Merton&#x27;s current research focus is on the topics of lifecycle investing and retirement funding, measuring and monitoring systemic risks in macrofinance, and financial innovation coupled with changing dynamics in financial institutions.

==Early life and education==
Merton was born in New York City to sociologist Robert K. Merton, who was of Jewish descent, and Suzanne Carhart, who was from a &quot;multigenerational southern New Jersey Methodist/Quaker family.&quot; He grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

Merton earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mathematics from the School of Engineering and Applied Science of Columbia University, a Masters of Science from the California Institute of Technology, and his doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1970 under the guidance of Paul Samuelson.

==Career== 
In 1970 Merton joined the faculty of the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he taught until 1988. Subsequently, Merton moved to Harvard University, where he was George Fisher Baker Professor of Business Administration from 1988 to 1998. He was the John and Natty McArthur University Professor from 1998-2010, becoming Professor Emeritus at Harvard University in 2010.

In 2010 Robert C. Merton rejoined the MIT Sloan School of Management where he is the School of Management Distinguished Professor of Finance. Since 2010, he also has been a Resident Scientist at Dimensional Fund Advisors, working on pension management. 

Merton received the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for a new methodology to value derivatives. He is past President of the American Finance Association (1986), a member of the National Academy of Sciences (1993) and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

He remained on the faculty at MIT in 2021.

==Research==
Merton’s research focuses on finance theory including lifecycle finance, optimal intertemporal portfolio selection, capital asset pricing, pricing of options, risky corporate debt, loan guarantees, and other complex derivative securities. He has also written on the operation and regulation of financial institutions. Merton’s current academic interests include financial innovation and dynamics of institutional change, controlling the propagation of macro financial risk, and improving methods of measuring and managing sovereign risk. He is the author of &quot;Continuous-Time Finance&quot;, and a co-author of &quot;Cases in Financial Engineering: Applied Studies of Financial Innovation&quot; and &quot;The Global Financial System: A Functional Perspective; Finance; and Financial Economics&quot;. Merton was a founding co-editor of the &quot;Annual Review of Financial Economics&quot;, serving from 2009 to 2021.

Merton has also been recognized for translating finance science into practice. He received the inaugural Financial Engineer of the Year Award from the International Association of Financial Engineers in 1993, which also elected him a senior fellow. &quot;Derivatives Strategy&quot; magazine named him to its Derivatives Hall of Fame in 1998 as did &quot;Risk&quot; magazine to its Risk Hall of Fame in 2002. He also received Risk’s Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to the field of risk management in 2003. A distinguished fellow of the Institute for Quantitative Research in Finance (&#x27;Q Group&#x27;, 1997) and a fellow of the Financial Management Association (2000), Merton received the Nicholas Molodovsky Award for Outstanding Contribution to Investment Research from the CFA Institute (2003).

His first professional association with a hedge fund came in 1968. His advisor at the time, Paul Samuelson, brought him on board Arbitrage Management Company (AMC), to join founder Michael Goodkin and chief executive Harry Markowitz. AMC is the first known attempt at computerized arbitrage trading. After a successful run as a private hedge fund, AMC was sold to Stuart &amp; Co. in 1971. In 1993, Merton co-founded a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, which earned high returns for four years but later lost $4.6 billion in 1998 and was bailed out by a consortium of banks and closed out in early 2000.

<doc id="97368" wikidata="Q7050346" url="?curid=97368" title="Seven of Nine">
<text>Seven of Nine (born Annika Hansen) is a fictional character introduced in the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. Portrayed by Jeri Ryan, she is a former Borg drone who joins the crew of the Federation starship &quot;Voyager&quot;. Her full Borg designation was Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix Zero One. While her birth name became known to her crewmates, after joining the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew she chose to continue to be called Seven of Nine, though she allowed &quot;Seven&quot; to be used informally.

Seven of Nine was introduced in the fourth-season premiere, &quot;Scorpion, Part II&quot;. The character replaced Kes in the main cast, and was intended to introduce a foil to Captain Kathryn Janeway, similar to the role Spock performs for Captain Kirk in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;. The character appeared through the final episode, &quot;Endgame&quot;. Stories related to her relationship with Captain Janeway and with The Doctor appeared throughout the series; some episodes, such as &quot;The Raven&quot;, explored her background and earlier life as Annika Hansen before she was assimilated by the Borg.

Seven of Nine, again played by Ryan, also appears in the series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; as a recurring character in the first season before being promoted to series regular for the second and third seasons.

==Casting and filming==

Following the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, the production team decided that the main cast character of Kes was to be dropped from the show. It was decided that Captain Kathryn Janeway needed a contrasting character, and so Seven of Nine was developed to fill this role. It had been a previous &quot;Star Trek&quot; staple to have a character that could provide a third-person view on the human condition, prior examples including Spock in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, Data in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and Odo in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. In addition, the producers of &quot;Voyager&quot; had been keen to make greater use of The Borg as recurring antagonists in the show, particularly after the success of the 1996 &quot;Next Generation&quot; feature film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;.

After being cast, actress Jeri Ryan acknowledged she had hardly even seen &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and had no idea what the Borg were. To prepare her, the producers gave her a copy of &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; and the &quot;Star Trek Encyclopedia&quot; the day before she was due to test for the part. She was specifically told not to base her performance on the Borg Queen from the film as she was a &quot;completely different animal and [they] were creating something entirely new&quot;. Her acting experience up until this point had consisted of television movies, guest appearances and &quot;Dark Skies&quot;.

Her audition process consisted of two readings for the producers before Ryan was asked to come in to talk through the part with the executive producers, Jeri Taylor, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. Following this, she tested for the network and was told that her option had been picked up. She remarked about her experience of joining the &quot;Voyager&quot; team: &quot;It was a little awkward since the cast had been together for three years already. And one of the original characters was being written out pretty much at the same time I was being added. But the cast was terrific, and very welcoming.&quot; Although she wore extensive make-up for her first appearances, including an eye-piece that fell off when she smiled, her typical make-up regimen took around 45 minutes, with the attachment of the Borg appliance above her eye taking an additional 15 minutes. Her hairstyling usually took as long as that combined.

In the following years, the &quot;Voyager&quot; writers wrote several plot lines revolving around Seven&#x27;s exploration of the positive and negative sides of human individuality. The cyborg nature of the character is seen as representing a challenge to &quot;simple conceptions of connections/disconnections between bodies.&quot; Ryan maintained that the main topic about Seven was &quot;humanity&quot; and stated that her character was pivotal to the success of the show, because she &quot;brought conflict to the show, which it was sadly lacking. … The &quot;Voyager&quot; crew was just one big happy family.&quot; After the addition of the former Borg drone to the starship&#x27;s crew at the start of the fourth season of &quot;Voyager&quot;, the shows&#x27; weekly viewer ratings increased by more than 60%. Ryan&#x27;s arrival on the show was accompanied by a massive publicity campaign in TV magazines and newspaper supplements. Ryan thought that the increase may have been because of the way the character looked, but maintained that those viewers would have been retained by the writing on the show.

She also remarked that &quot;combining non-human qualities with an attractive human appearance,&quot; as in Seven&#x27;s character, was a great move by the producers. She felt that the writers did a good job in not pushing the character to be more human and having Seven enter into relationships on the show. Ryan was concerned that it could have turned out to be &quot;Seven&#x27;s sexual escapades on &quot;Voyager&quot;&quot;. In terms of portrayal, she said that &quot;keeping a straight face&quot; while showing suppressed emotion was an enjoyable challenge. Regarding her form-fitting one-piece costume, Ryan commented that it was extremely impractical and uncomfortable, but worth the reward of portraying a character like Seven.

Although Seven was originally introduced as a foil for Captain Janeway, with the two of them proving to be very adversarial, they gained mutual respect as time went by. Ryan later described this as a mother-daughter relationship on the show, although she said that the writers had managed to make the character into more of an unruly teenager. The inclusion of Seven of Nine as a primary character for the show alongside Janeway and the Doctor was criticised by other actors. Robert Beltran, who played Chakotay felt that his character, along with Harry Kim, Tuvok and Neelix, were being overlooked. As the end of the series approached, Ryan remarked that she would &quot;love to do something without special effects or rubber glued to my face, it&#x27;d be a nice change of pace.&quot;

Following the end of &quot;Voyager&quot;, Ryan joined the main cast of &quot;Boston Public&quot;, comparing her new character of Ronnie with Seven of Nine, saying &quot;[Seven] had all of these emotions, she just wasn&#x27;t comfortable expressing them, and didn&#x27;t really know how to express them; Ronnie, my character on &quot;Boston Public&quot;, is quite comfortable expressing them, and is fairly free with her expressions, I think. So it&#x27;s going to be a lot of fun. It&#x27;s going to be much more free, as far as the acting style.&quot; Ryan said that she had several favourite Seven of Nine episodes, including &quot;The Gift&quot;, &quot;The Raven&quot;, &quot;Revulsion&quot;, &quot;Hunters&quot;, &quot;Prey&quot; and the two-part &quot;The Killing Game&quot;.

===Attire and filming issues===
Her initial costume as seen in &quot;Scorpion&quot; and the following episode, &quot;The Gift&quot;, saw Seven of Nine as a full Borg. This outfit took some two-and-a-half hours for Ryan to get into, but an error was made in measuring the outfit by not taking into account the prosthetics that she was required to wear for the part. This cut off the blood supply through her carotid artery, causing her to pass out on two occasions. After a nurse was called twice to supply oxygen, the costume was modified to stop it from happening again.

Once the character had the majority of the Borg implants removed, a new costume was required. Ryan wore a silver jumpsuit for the first few episodes, which director Jesús Salvador Treviño said that during the filming of the episode &quot;Day of Honor&quot; caused problems as &quot;almost any camera angle inevitably winds up emphasising her sexuality.&quot; Ryan described the new costume as &quot;a little snug&quot;, and wore a corset-like item which gave the appearance of mechanical ribs. At least one version of the costume had the corset built into it. In order to give her greater height, the shoes which formed part of her costume had four-inch (10 cm) high heels. She said in a 2012 interview that the suit by costume designer Robert Blackman was a &quot;feat of engineering&quot;, but required a 20-minute production shutdown if she needed to use the toilet, as she needed that time plus assistance to get into and out of it. She said that it was so fitted and figure hugging that it &quot;might as well have been body paint&quot;. The lengthy time it took to use the bathroom led to the actress not drinking any fluids, which in turn made her feel sick.

Treviño praised the subsequent changes to her costume in order to reduce its sexuality, saying that &quot;it is much more sensible, because she&#x27;s still an attractive person but then you get away from that titillation stuff which I think is so demeaning not only to the audience, but it&#x27;s kinda of demeaning to what &quot;Star Trek&quot; is about.&quot; The later versions of her costumes still required 20 minutes to get into before filming could start, but Ryan said they were much more forgiving, &quot;In the silver costume, if I got goosebumps, you could see them. The brown costume is a thicker, stronger fabric. It&#x27;s not quite so clingy, so the waist doesn&#x27;t have to be cinched in.&quot; That version of the costume also removed the vertical bones of the corset, which allowed Ryan to have greater flexibility while wearing it.

One of the major remaining pieces of Borg technology that Ryan continued to wear for the part was what she described as &quot;That little thing over my eye&quot;. This was because the term that referred to it in the episodes would change depending on the writers and the episode itself, she explained that &quot;Sometimes, it&#x27;s my cortical implant. Sometimes, it&#x27;s my cranial implant. Sometimes, it&#x27;s my ocular implant.&quot;

==Appearances==
Seven of Nine appeared on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; between 1997 and 2001, and between 2020 and 2023 on &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;.

===Background===
Seven of Nine&#x27;s backstory was explained during the course of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. She was born on the Tendara Colony on Stardate 25479 to Magnus and Erin Hansen, and was named Annika. At the age of four, her parents were given use of the research vessel USS &quot;Raven&quot; by Starfleet to help them investigate the presence of an unknown species in deep space. This trip lasted for three years during which time they encountered the Borg and, using a transwarp conduit, followed a cube to the Delta Quadrant. Annika&#x27;s father developed technology to allow the ship to remain undetected by the aliens, and even to allow them to board the Borg vessel; but after an ion storm struck the vessel, the Borg detected the family and assimilated them.

Annika was placed into a Borg maturation chamber for the next few years, during which time she joined the collective. Following this, she was a Borg drone and assimilated individuals from a number of species, including a crew member from the USS &quot;Melbourne&quot; at the Battle of Wolf 359 on Stardate 43989.1. Two years later, Seven of Nine, along with three other drones, crashed on a planet and they were separated from the Borg Collective. This caused their individualities to resurface over time, which caused Seven to panic due to her relative inexperience with individuality; she forcibly took control of the other drones in a temporary hive mind until the Borg found them.

===&quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;===

====Joining the crew in &quot;Scorpion&quot;====
Seven of Nine first appears in the second part of &quot;Scorpion&quot; at the start of the fourth season. She is chosen by the Borg to communicate verbally with Captain Janeway so that together they can develop a weapon to defeat Species 8472. After a Borg cube destroys itself to save &quot;Voyager&quot;, Seven is transported aboard the Federation ship. Janeway is injured, leaving Chakotay in command—but he distrusts Seven and the Borg and after he refuses to work with her, she sends the vessel into fluidic space to force them to develop the weapon. Just before doing so, Chakotay decompresses the cargo bay, killing the remaining Borg with the exception of Seven. Janeway recovers and works with Seven and the Doctor to develop the weapon and defeat an attack by Species 8472. With their alliance ended, Seven attempts to assimilate the crew but they override her neural connection to the Collective. Over the course of the following episode, &quot;The Gift&quot;, The Doctor removes about 70% of Seven&#x27;s Borg implants because her body begins to reject the technology once her connection to the Borg Collective is severed. Seven leaves sick bay to help repair the ship, and while working she attempts to communicate with the Collective but is stopped by Kes. She is placed in the brig where she and Captain Janeway have a heart-to-heart discussion. Following the departure of Kes, Seven (now restored by The Doctor to her original human appearance) is recruited to join &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s crew.

Seven immediately comes into conflict with Chief Engineer B&#x27;Elanna Torres in &quot;Day of Honor&quot; and puts &quot;Voyager&quot; in danger when the Caatati steal the warp drive and hold it hostage for supplies and Seven herself. Instead, she builds a thorium generator to power their vessel, which the Caatati accept in exchange for the core and for allowing the rescue of Torres and Lt. Tom Paris. In &quot;The Raven&quot;, Seven, experiencing visions of the Borg and a raven, steals a shuttle and heads into nearby B&#x27;omar space. The aliens would not allow &quot;Voyager&quot; to enter their space, but Tuvok and Paris cross the border in another shuttle and head in pursuit. Tuvok beams across to Seven&#x27;s shuttle, where she explains she&#x27;s following a homing beacon. They head to a planet where the wreckage of the USS &quot;Raven&quot; is crashed on the surface. They transport down and Seven recognises it as her parents&#x27; vessel. The B&#x27;omar attack but &quot;Voyager&quot; comes to their aid and the crew depart. Janeway tells Seven that her parents&#x27; research records are in the ship&#x27;s databanks; Seven replies that she might read them someday.

After some time, Seven begins to question why Captain Janeway continues to make contact with alien species as they travel back to Earth, as it often results in incidents. Janeway explains that &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s purpose is exploration and will continue that mission despite any problems that might occur. While working in astrometrics, Seven detects an ancient alien communications platform which connects all the way back to the borders of Federation space. This results in the first successful communication with Starfleet since &quot;Voyager&quot; was stranded in the Delta Quadrant, although it does also result in angering an alien race upon first contact; the Hirogen had claimed the platform for their own. The crew subsequently receive messages from home through the array, but the ship is once again threatened by the Hirogen. Tuvok and Seven transport aboard the array to speed the downloading of the messages, but are captured and tortured by the aliens. They are rescued by &quot;Voyager&quot;, but the communications array is destroyed. When the crew find a member of Species 8472 being hunted by the Hirogen, Seven is reluctant to help her former enemy as it would put the ship at risk of destruction from the Hirogen. When the Hirogen threaten &quot;Voyager&quot;, Seven disobeys Janeway&#x27;s command and transports the alien aboard a Hirogen ship. In response, the Captain punishes her by restricting her computer access and confines her to the cargo bay where her Borg regeneration unit is set up.

In &quot;Retrospect&quot;, the Doctor accidentally causes Seven to relive repressed memories of while she was Borg. She confers these memories onto an alien she had just met, and the local authorities seek his arrest. The crew realise what has happened, but he is killed before he can be told he is innocent. During the events of &quot;The Killing Game&quot; where the Hirogen take over &quot;Voyager&quot; and place the crew in the holodeck for hunting practice, Seven is brainwashed into thinking she was a French club singer during the Nazi occupation of France. She is the first member of the crew who has her memories restored by the Doctor, and helps Janeway bring about a truce with the Hirogen. Janeway and Seven disagree once more in &quot;The Omega Directive&quot; about what to do when the ship detects unstable Omega particles nearby. The Captain wants to destroy them under Starfleet standing orders, while Seven seeks to harness them as the Borg consider the particles to be near perfection. Seven must later deal with a series of hallucinations and loneliness while helping the crew cross a radiation-filled nebula in &quot;One&quot;. This experience results in her seeking out the company of other crew members more frequently. Her suspicions of Arturis prove correct in &quot;Hope and Fear&quot; when it is revealed that he was seeking revenge on the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew for their previous alliance with the Borg by creating a fake USS &quot;Dauntless&quot; and attempting to take them back to Borg space where they would be assimilated.

====Relationships====
A few episodes touch on Seven&#x27;s romantic life, which is limited due to the effect on her emotions of having been part of the Borg. At one point she propositions Harry Kim, but he turns her down. Later on, with the Doctor&#x27;s assistance, she tries dating other crew unsuccessfully, while later exploring intimate relationships with a hologram of Chakotay. Finally, in &quot;Endgame&quot; she is involved in a romantic relationship with Chakotay which includes at least three dates and a first kiss. In one alternate timeline, they married before her death, and, in another, she is killed along with the rest of the Voyager crew (&quot;Timeless&quot;).

Seven has her first experience of motherhood to some degree when, in the episode &quot;Drone&quot;, a transporter accident combines her nanoprobes with the Doctor&#x27;s holoemitter. This results in the creation of One, a Borg with 29th-century technology, whom Seven helps adjust to life on board &quot;Voyager&quot;. One sacrifices his life to destroy a Borg sphere and protect the vessel, dying in front of an emotional Seven. In the alternative future shown in &quot;Timeless&quot;, Seven of Nine and the vast majority of the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew are dead. Using a Borg temporal transmitter, Chakotay and Harry Kim manage to send information back in time to Seven to prevent the destruction of the ship. A little more of Seven&#x27;s Borg history is revealed when, due to a modified Borg device planted by an alien species, she begins to exhibit the memories of some of the people she has assimilated. After B&#x27;Elanna Torres disables the device, Seven returns to normal.

While investigating a damaged Borg sphere in &quot;Dark Frontier&quot;, Seven hears the voice of the collective once more and refuses to return to &quot;Voyager&quot;. Instead, she is taken back to Borg space where she meets with the Borg Queen, who reveals that Seven&#x27;s establishment as an individual was all part of a plan to use her memories to allow the Borg to assimilate humanity. The Queen first has Seven assist in the assimilation of a new species, and after some disobedience, has her work on nanoprobes designed to assimilate humans. Seven discovers that her father is assimilated and kept as one of the Queen&#x27;s personal drones. Meanwhile, &quot;Voyager&quot; is working on a plan to rescue her, and using the &quot;Delta Flyer&quot;, approach the vessel close enough that Captain Janeway can transport aboard. Seven and Janeway work together to escape the Queen, and steal technology that reduces their distance to Earth by 15 years. She later attempts to develop her experience of romance, working with the Doctor in the episode &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot;.

She becomes involved in a time-travel plot once more when Captain Braxton of the Federation timeship USS &quot;Relativity&quot; pulls her out of the timestream to help prevent the destruction of &quot;Voyager&quot;. The travel has effects on her body, and she dies, resulting in an earlier version being pulled out of time. During the investigation, it transpires that it was Braxton himself who planted a bomb on the ship and together with the crew of the &quot;Relativity&quot;, Captain Janeway manages to apprehend Braxton before he plants the device. Seven encounters three former Borg with which she previously formed a mini-collective after their scout vessel crashed on a planet; where the other three were assimilated as adults, Seven&#x27;s childhood assimilation left her panicking at being separated from the Collective and facing an individuality she did not know how to cope with on her own. She forced this collective on them because they were becoming individuals, which has caused the trio to keep a mental connection even after their eventual disconnection from the rest of the Borg. During the course of &quot;Survival Instinct&quot;, the link is terminated, causing each of the former Borg to be predicted to die within a month.

===&quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;===
Seven of Nine appeared as a recurring character in the first season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, and as a main cast member in the second season. In &quot;Picard&quot;, set more than twenty years after the finale of &quot;Voyager&quot;, Seven is a member of the Fenris Rangers, a peacekeeping organization active near the former Romulan Neutral Zone. Ryan notes her portrayal is &quot;much more human&quot; and developed a new speaking cadence to reflect the character&#x27;s two decades living in Federation space.

In 2386, nine years after the USS &quot;Voyager&quot; returned to Earth, Seven&#x27;s surrogate son Icheb was abducted by Borg harvesters. Seven attempted to rescue him but arrived too late, finding him mortally wounded. Icheb died in Seven&#x27;s arms after she acceded to his request to mercy kill him.

In 2399, Seven encounters Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of &quot;La Sirena&quot; en route to the planet Freecloud. Seven assists Picard in his attempt to rescue Dr. Bruce Maddox from Bjayzl, a criminal businesswoman, by offering herself as bounty. It is revealed that Seven&#x27;s true intentions are to kill Bjayzl, who was responsible for Icheb&#x27;s death. Picard believes he is able to talk Seven out of killing Bjayzl, and they return to &quot;La Sirena&quot; with Maddox. She and Picard discuss their mutual difficulty regaining their humanity after being assimilated by the Borg, and she disembarks under the pretense of rejoining the Rangers, but actually transports back to the surface and vaporizes Bjayzl.

Seven arrives at the Artifact, a disabled Borg cube captured by the Romulans, after being summoned by Picard&#x27;s companion Elnor. To save the former Borg onboard from execution at the hands of the Romulans, she temporarily connects herself to the cube inside the queencell, taking on the role of a Borg Queen. She does this despite concern about keeping control:

:&quot;Seven of Nine: Assimilate them? Invade their minds? Suppress their identities, enslave them? Again? 
:&quot;Elnor: You can release them when we win.
:&quot;Seven of Nine: They won&#x27;t want to be released. And I... I might not want to release them.&quot; 
Despite her concerns, Seven is able to disconnect herself after the Romulan forces have been driven off the cube, stating that &quot;Annika&quot; still has work to do. She brings the cube to Soji&#x27;s homeworld, Coppelius, to aid Picard, but it crashes on the surface after being disabled by the planetary defenses. When the Romulan armada arrives at the planet to destroy the synthetics, the Romulan agent Narissa attempts to access the cube&#x27;s weapons to destroy &quot;La Sirena&quot;, but is pushed off a ledge by Seven. After the Romulan armada is warded off, Seven joins the crew of &quot;La Sirena&quot; and is seen holding hands with Picard&#x27;s companion Raffi.

Seven returns in the second season, where she is the captain of &quot;La Sirena&quot; after Rios had returned to Starfleet, and she is in a relationship with Raffi. When Q sends her and others back in a changed timeline, where she was never assimilated and is President Annika Hansen of the Earth-based &quot;Confederation of Earth&quot;, she joins the &quot;La Sirena&quot; crew in a time travel journey back to 2024 to prevent Q from creating the alternate timeline and enjoys being Borg-free for the first time since she was six. Seven and Raffi try to find the mysterious Watcher and end up rescuing Rios from ICE officers after being involved in a car chase. She later helps protect and watch over Renée Picard, who is the focus of Q&#x27;s machinations. She and Raffi then search for Jurati and find that she is slowly becoming a new Borg Queen. In a fight between Borg soldiers, former mercenaries, Adam Soong and the Jurati/Borg Queen entity, she is partially reassimilated to save her life, after Jurati is able to remind the Borg Queen of her affection for Seven. It is also revealed that after &quot;Voyager&quot; returned to Earth, Seven tried to formally join Starfleet, but was rejected because of her Borg implants. Admiral Janeway threatened to resign from Starfleet over the matter, but Seven dropped her request and joined the Fenris Rangers instead. In the season finale, when they are sent back to their own timeline, Picard gives Seven a field commission, and she takes command of the USS &quot;Stargazer&quot;.

In the third season, Seven, with Picard and Janeway&#x27;s encouragement, has remained a Starfleet officer with the rank of commander. She is assigned as first officer of the USS &quot;Titan&quot;-A, the successor to the ship that William Riker commanded for many years. The transition has not been smooth, as her captain, Liam Shaw, does not trust her due to her Borg past and insists that she use her human name. In the final episode of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, Tuvok promotes Seven of Nine to the rank of captain, revealing that Shaw had given her a glowing recommendation for command in spite of the friction between them. Seven is given command of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NCC-1701-G), with Commander Raffi Musiker as her first officer and Ensign Jack Crusher II as her counselor. She is last seen about to give her first command as captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

===Novels, comics and video games===
Following the switch of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic properties to WildStorm, the first comic to be released was &quot;Star Trek: Voyager - False Colors&quot;. This featured Seven of Nine in a prominent role, as the crew investigate what appears to be a Borg vessel.

Seven of Nine has made appearances in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; comics, such as in IDW Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation – Hive&quot;. She has also continued to be a main character in the &quot;Voyager&quot; novel relaunch.

Some of the novels that prominently feature Seven of Nine include &quot;Seven of Nine&quot; by Christie Golden, &quot;No Time Like the Past&quot; by Greg Cox, &quot;Shadow&quot; by Dean Wesley Smith, &quot;The Nanotech War&quot; by Steven Piziks, &quot;The Farther Shore&quot; by Christie Golden, and &quot;Before Dishonor&quot; by Peter David. There is also a script book featuring six television episodes called &quot;Becoming Human: The Seven of Nine Saga&quot;.

The first video game that the character of Seven of Nine appeared in was &quot;Star Trek: Voyager – Elite Force&quot;. Despite the rest of the main cast voicing their characters, Jeri Ryan did not voice Seven. Instead, the character was voiced by Joan Buddenhagen, with Ryan&#x27;s voice pack added alongside an expansion to the game. It was also made available as a free download for those that did not purchase the expansion pack. Jeri Ryan has also voiced the character in the &quot;Delta Rising&quot; expansion to &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). The game is set beyond the end of the original &quot;Voyager&quot; series, with the storyline placing Seven on board the USS &quot;Callisto&quot; as a science advisor to the Federation fleet which is returning to the Delta Quadrant. When asked about returning as Seven for the game at the Destination &quot;Star Trek&quot; 3 convention in London, England, Ryan said that &quot;It was fun, surprisingly fun, she fit like an old pair of slippers.&quot;

==Reception==

The initial fan reaction was mixed with some accusing the show of adding her to attract more 18–35 male audience members, which was denied by Braga. The character&#x27;s attire, numerous form-fitting catsuits with distinct rib-lines and a high stiff neck, was criticized by veteran &quot;Star Trek&quot; writer/producer Ronald D. Moore, who felt she should have a more Borg-like appearance. Her outfit also annoyed some who felt that it was an attempt by the show&#x27;s creators to make her sexually appealing to some viewers, without any storyline purposes intended. Keith DeCandido of &quot;Tor.com&quot; was critical of the hair and costume which &quot;for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with the character and everything to do with external factors&quot; but that Ryan&#x27;s performance manages to elevate matters, and give Seven a compelling journey. Ryan was surprised at the immediate fan reaction on the Internet, as there was a full website devoted to her, created only six days after her casting.

Ziauddin Sardar said in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; that her appearance on &quot;Voyager&quot; &quot;restored the warp drive&quot; to the show, resulting in a &quot;triumphant note&quot; to the start of the following season. Meanwhile, Ian Spelling writing in &quot;Starlog&quot; magazine in 1998 said that the introduction of Seven was &quot;just the kick in the asteroid that &quot;Voyager&quot; needed.&quot;

Rob Owen at the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said that the majority of the &quot;Voyager&quot; cast were &quot;lacking in depth&quot; with the exception of Seven, the Doctor and Captain Janeway. By the end of the series, Seven was described as the &quot;most bewitching cast member&quot; and the &quot;first authentic Trek bombshell since Uhura&quot; by Frank Ahrens at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.
In 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Seven of Nine as the 12th-best character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall. In 2012, &quot;Paste&quot; rated Seven of Nine as the fifth-best character of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; rated Seven of Nine as the tenth-best character in &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall. They highlight the character&#x27;s slow recovery after being victimized by the Borg. In 2018, &quot;CBR&quot; ranked Jeri Ryan, who plays Seven of Nine, as the 14th best actor of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

Askmen.com ranked Seven of Nine as the fourth-most-attractive woman of the science fiction genre, including film and television. In 2011, Seven of Nine was ranked the second-top-sexiest woman of science fiction television. In 2017, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Seven of Nine the fourth-most-attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. &quot;CBR&quot; ranked Seven of Nine the &quot;15th-fiercest&quot; female character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. In 2019, Seven of Nine was ranked the fourth-sexiest &quot;Star Trek&quot; character by &quot;SyFy&quot;.

===Themes===
The initial episodes following the introduction of Seven of Nine showed Captain Janeway mirroring the actions of the Borg as she turned down Seven&#x27;s request to be returned to the collective. Abducting Seven was also suggested to be a &quot;tough-love&quot; scenario with Janeway taking the place of Seven&#x27;s mother, while the Doctor posed as her father. It was this new family relationship that later caused the Borg Queen to modify her tactics to re-assimilate Seven in the episode &quot;Dark Frontier&quot;, by simulating a mother-daughter relationship. The Doctor, Seven and Janeway relationship was also compared to Pygmalion showing Galatea to Venus in the way that the Doctor re-humanised Seven during the events of &quot;The Gift&quot;.

Seven was received as one of the &quot;Voyager&quot; characters who filled a Spock-like role, alongside Tuvok, with her &quot;blonde bombshell&quot; appearance balanced by &quot;intelligence, boldness, rationality and a remarkable lack of interest in the opposite sex&quot;.

The sexuality of the character was also questioned following her introduction. The character built up a fanbase among the LGBT community which resulted in an online petition to have her revealed as a lesbian. It was pointed out in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; that the series attempted to avoid any &quot;lesbian subtext&quot; between Seven and Janeway because it was intended to be seen as &quot;family-friendly&quot;. The truth is that there was no romantic relationship between Seven and Janeway. The approach by Harry Kim at one point, to which she suggested that he should disrobe in order to &quot;copulate&quot;, was suggested to be because of her curiosity about human mating practices rather than any traditional sense of attraction. Seven had romantic ties to First Officer Chakotay, and in the final episodes of the series they fell in love. When the character returned in the series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; she was portrayed in a same-sex relationship.

The introduction of Seven on the series had subsequent effects on the series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, as T&#x27;Pol (played by Jolene Blalock) was based on a combination of the Seven character and Leonard Nimoy&#x27;s original Spock.

The efforts of Seven to return to normal living have been compared by many writers to the deprogramming of former cult members.

=== Award and nominations ===
Jeri Ryan was nominated on five occasions at the Saturn Awards for portraying Seven of Nine, winning in 2001 and 2024 for Best Supporting Actress on Television. She has also won the Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama in 1999.
