<text>Jean Renoir (; 15 September 1894 – 12 February 1979) was a French film director, screenwriter, actor, producer and author. His &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; (1939) are often cited by critics as among the greatest films ever made. In 2002, he was ranked fourth on the BFI&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll of the greatest directors. Among numerous honours accrued during his lifetime, he received a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award in 1975. Renoir was the son of the painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir and the uncle of the cinematographer Claude Renoir. With Claude, he made &quot;The River&quot; (1951), the first color film shot in India. A lifelong lover of theater, Renoir turned to the stage for &quot;The Golden Coach&quot; (1952) and &quot;French Cancan&quot; (1955). He was one of the first filmmakers to be known as an &quot;auteur&quot;; the critic Penelope Gilliatt said a Renoir shot could be identified &quot;in a thousand miles of film.&quot;

Pauline Kael wrote that &quot;At his greatest, Jean Renoir expresses the beauty in our common humanity—the desires and hopes, the absurdities and follies, that we all, to one degree or another, share.&quot; Per &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;The style that ran through Mr. Renoir&#x27;s films — a mixture of tenderness, irony and Gallic insouciance‐was caught in a famous line from his 1939 masterpiece, &quot;The Rules of the Game.&quot; It was spoken by Octave, played by the director himself: &#x27;You see, in this world, there is one awful thing, and that is that everyone has his reasons.&#x27;”

==Early life==
Renoir was born in the Montmartre district of Paris, France. He was the second son of Aline (née Charigot) Renoir and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, the Impressionist painter. His elder brother was Pierre Renoir, a French stage and film actor, and his younger brother Claude Renoir (1901–1969) had a brief career in the film industry, mostly assisting on a few of Jean&#x27;s films. Jean Renoir was also the uncle of Claude Renoir (1913–1993), the son of Pierre, a cinematographer who worked with Jean Renoir on several of his films. He recalls that &quot;I discovered Alexandre Dumas when I was about ten. I am still discovering him.&quot;

Renoir was largely raised by Gabrielle Renard, his nanny and his mother&#x27;s cousin, with whom he developed a strong bond. Shortly before his birth, she had come to live with the Renoir family. She introduced the young boy to the Guignol puppet shows in Montmartre, which influenced his later film career. He wrote in his 1974 memoirs &quot;My Life and My Films&quot;, &quot;She taught me to see the face behind the mask and the fraud behind the flourishes. She taught me to detest the cliché.&quot; Gabrielle was also fascinated by the new early motion pictures, and when Renoir was only a few years old she took him to see his first film.

As a child, Renoir moved to the south of France with his family. He and the rest of the Renoir family were the subjects of many of his father&#x27;s paintings. His father&#x27;s financial success ensured that the young Renoir was educated at fashionable boarding schools, from which, as he later wrote, he frequently ran away.

At the outbreak of World War I, Renoir was serving in the French cavalry. Later, after receiving a bullet in his leg, he served as a reconnaissance pilot. His leg injury left him with a permanent limp, but allowed him to develop his interest in the cinema, since he recuperated with his leg elevated while watching films, including the works of Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith and others. After the war, Renoir followed his father&#x27;s suggestion and tried making ceramic art, but he soon set that aside to make films in the attempt, he would later claim, to make his wife, Hessling, a star. He was particularly inspired by Erich von Stroheim&#x27;s work.

==Career==
===Early years===
In 1924, Renoir directed &quot;Une Vie Sans Joie&quot; or &quot;Catherine&quot;, the first of his nine silent films, most of which starred his first wife, Catherine Hessling, who was also his father&#x27;s last model. At this stage, his films did not produce a return. Renoir gradually sold paintings inherited from his father to finance them.

===International success in the 1930s===
During the 1930s Renoir enjoyed great success as a filmmaker. In 1931 he directed his first sound films, &quot;On purge bébé&quot; (&quot;Baby&#x27;s Laxative&quot;) and &quot;La Chienne&quot; (&quot;The Bitch&quot;). The following year he made &quot;Boudu Saved from Drowning&quot; (&quot;Boudu sauvé des eaux&quot;), a farcical sendup of the pretensions of a middle-class bookseller and his family, who meet with comic, and ultimately disastrous, results when they attempt to reform a vagrant played by Michel Simon. In 1934, he filmed an adaptation of Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1857). His 1935 film &quot;Toni&quot;, shot on locations with a nonprofessional cast, was later an influence on the French New Wave.

By the middle of the decade, Renoir was associated with the Popular Front. Several of his films, such as &quot;The Crime of Monsieur Lange&quot; (&quot;Le Crime de Monsieur Lange&quot;, 1935), &quot;Life Belongs to Us&quot; (1936) and (1938), reflect the movement&#x27;s politics.

In 1937, he made &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot;, one of his best-known films, starring Erich von Stroheim and Jean Gabin. A film on the theme of brotherhood, relating a series of escape attempts by French POWs during World War I, it was enormously successful. It was banned in Germany, and later in Italy, after having won the Best Artistic Ensemble award at the Venice Film Festival. It was the first foreign language film to receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 1938, the Nazis disrupted a showing of &quot;La Grande Illusion.&quot; Renoir reflected, &quot;This is a story that fills me with real pride.&quot;

He followed it with &quot;The Human Beast&quot; () (1938), a film noir and tragedy based on the novel by Émile Zola and starring Gabin and Simone Simon. It too was a success.

In 1939, able to co-finance his own films, Renoir made &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; (&quot;La Règle du Jeu&quot;), a satire on contemporary French society with an ensemble cast. Renoir played the character Octave, who serves to connect characters from different social strata. The film was his greatest commercial failure, met with derision by Parisian audiences at its premiere. He extensively reedited the work, but without success at the time.

A few weeks after the outbreak of World War II, the film was banned by the government. Renoir was a known pacifist and supporter of the French Communist Party, which made him suspect in the tense weeks before the war began. The ban was lifted briefly in 1940, but after the fall of France that June, it was banned again. Subsequently, the original negative of the film was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid. It was not until the 1950s that French film enthusiasts Jean Gaborit and Jacques Durand, with Renoir&#x27;s cooperation, reconstructed a near-complete print of the film. Since that time, &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; has been reappraised and has frequently appeared near the top of critics&#x27; polls of the best films ever made.

A week after the disastrous premiere of &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; in July 1939, Renoir went to Rome with Karl Koch and Dido Freire, subsequently his second wife, to work on the script for a film version of &quot;Tosca&quot;. At the age of 45, he became a lieutenant in the French Army Film Service. He was sent back to Italy, to teach film at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome, and resume work on &quot;Tosca&quot;. The French government hoped this cultural exchange would help maintain friendly relations with Italy, which had not yet entered the war. He abandoned the project to return to France and make himself available for military service in August 1939.

===Hollywood===
After Germany invaded France in May 1940, Renoir fled to the United States with Dido Freire. &quot;Dido and I travelled by sea from Marseilles to Algeria, Morocco and Lisbon... At Lisbon we got places on an American ship, and I was delighted to find myself sharing a cabin with none other than the writer Saint-Exupéry.&quot; In Hollywood, Renoir had difficulty finding projects that suited him. His first American film, &quot;Swamp Water&quot; (1941), was a drama starring Dana Andrews and Walter Brennan. He co-produced and directed an anti-Nazi film set in France, &quot;This Land Is Mine&quot; (1943), starring Maureen O&#x27;Hara and Charles Laughton. &quot;The Southerner&quot; (1945) is a film about Texas sharecroppers that is often regarded as his best American film. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Directing for this work.

&quot;Diary of a Chambermaid&quot; (1946) is an adaptation of the Octave Mirbeau novel, &quot;Le Journal d&#x27;une femme de chambre&quot;, starring Paulette Goddard and Burgess Meredith. His &quot;The Woman on the Beach&quot; (1947), starring Joan Bennett and Robert Ryan, was heavily reshot and reedited after it fared poorly among preview audiences in California. Both films were poorly received; they were the last films Renoir made in America. At this time, Renoir became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

===Post-Hollywood===
In 1949 Renoir traveled to India to shoot &quot;The River&quot; (1951), his first color film. Based on the novel of the same name by Rumer Godden, the film is both a meditation on human beings&#x27; relationship with nature and a coming of age story of three young girls in colonial India. The film won the International Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1951.

After returning to work in Europe, Renoir made a trilogy of color musical comedies on the subjects of theater, politics and commerce: &quot;Le Carrosse d&#x27;or&quot; (&quot;The Golden Coach&quot;, 1953) with Anna Magnani; &quot;French Cancan&quot; (1954) with Jean Gabin and María Félix; and &quot;Eléna et les hommes&quot; (&quot;Elena and Her Men&quot;, 1956) with Ingrid Bergman and Jean Marais. During the same period Renoir produced Clifford Odets&#x27; play &quot;The Big Knife&quot; in Paris. He also wrote his own play, &quot;Orvet&quot;, and produced it in Paris featuring Leslie Caron.

Renoir made his next films with techniques adapted from live television. &quot;Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; (&quot;Picnic on the Grass&quot;, 1959), starring Paul Meurisse and Catherine Rouvel, was filmed on the grounds of Pierre-Auguste Renoir&#x27;s home in Cagnes-sur-Mer, and &quot;Le Testament du docteur Cordelier&quot; (&quot;The Testament of Doctor Cordelier&quot;, also 1959), starring Jean-Louis Barrault, was made in the streets of Paris and its suburbs.

Renoir&#x27;s penultimate film, &quot;Le Caporal épinglé&quot; (&quot;The Elusive Corporal&quot;, 1962), with Jean-Pierre Cassel and Claude Brasseur, is set among French POWs during their internment in labor camps by the Nazis during World War II. The film explores the twin human needs for freedom, on the one hand, and emotional and economic security, on the other.

Renoir&#x27;s loving memoir of his father, &quot;Renoir, My Father&quot; (1962) describes the profound influence his father had on him and his work. As funds for his film projects were becoming harder to obtain, Renoir continued to write screenplays for income. He published a novel, &quot;The Notebooks of Captain Georges&quot;, in 1966. &quot;Captain Georges&quot; is the nostalgic account of a wealthy young man&#x27;s sentimental education and love for a peasant girl, a theme also explored earlier in his films &quot;Diary of a Chambermaid&quot; and &quot;Picnic on the Grass&quot;.

===Last years===
Renoir&#x27;s last film is &quot;Le Petit théâtre de Jean Renoir&quot; (&quot;The Little Theatre of Jean Renoir&quot;), released in 1970. It is a series of three short films made in a variety of styles. It is, in many ways, one of his most challenging, avant-garde and unconventional works.

Unable to obtain financing for his films and suffering declining health, Renoir spent his last years receiving friends at his home in Beverly Hills, and writing novels and his memoirs.

In 1973 Renoir was preparing a production of his stage play, &quot;Carola,&quot; with Leslie Caron and Mel Ferrer when he fell ill and was unable to direct. The producer Norman Lloyd, a friend and actor in &quot;The Southerner&quot;, took over the direction of the play. It was broadcast in the series program &quot;Hollywood Television Theater&quot; on WNET, Channel 13, New York on 3 February 1973.

Renoir&#x27;s memoir, &quot;My Life and My Films&quot;, was published in 1974. He wrote of the influence exercised by Gabrielle Renard, his nanny and his mother&#x27;s cousin, with whom he developed a mutual lifelong bond. He concluded his memoirs with the words he had often spoken as a child, &quot;Wait for me, Gabrielle.&quot; 

In 1975 Renoir received a lifetime Academy Award for his contribution to the motion picture industry. That same year a retrospective of his work was shown at the National Film Theatre in London. Also in 1975, the government of France elevated him to the rank of commander in the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

==Personal life and death==
Renoir was married to Catherine Hessling, an actress and model. After many years, they divorced. His second wife was Dido Freire.
Renoir&#x27;s son Alain Renoir (1921–2008) became a professor of English and comparative literature at the University of California, Berkeley and a scholar of medieval English literature.

Jean Renoir died in Beverly Hills, California, on 12 February 1979 of a heart attack. His body was returned to France and buried beside his family in the cemetery at Essoyes, France.

==Legacy==

On his death, fellow director and friend Orson Welles wrote &quot;Jean Renoir: The Greatest of All Directors&quot; in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Renoir&#x27;s films have influenced many other directors, including Éric Rohmer, Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet, Peter Bogdanovich, François Truffaut, Robert Altman, Errol Morris Martin Scorsese and Mike Leigh. Truffaut named his production company &quot;Les Films du Carrosse&quot; after Renoir&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Coach&quot; (&quot;La Carrosse d&#x27;Or&quot;). Four of Renoir&#x27;s crew members, Satyajit Ray, Luchino Visconti, Robert Aldrich and Jacques Becker, would go on to become highly acclaimed directors in their own right. He was an influence on the French New Wave, and his memoir is dedicated &quot;to those film-makers who are known to the public as the &#x27;New Wave&#x27; and whose preoccupations are mine.&quot; Altman said &quot;I learned the rules of the game from &quot;The Rules of the Game.&quot;&quot; 

Renoir has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6212 Hollywood Blvd. Several of his ceramics were collected by Albert Barnes, who was a major patron and collector of Renoir&#x27;s father. These can be found on display beneath Pierre-Auguste Renoir&#x27;s paintings at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia.

According to David Thomson, Renoir was &quot;the model of humanist cinema, an informal genre that included Frank Capra, Vittorio De Sica, Satyajit Ray, Yasujirō Ozu or even Charlie Chaplin.&quot; In &quot;The New Biographical Dictionary of Film&quot;, he writes: &quot;Renoir asks us to see the variety and muddle of life without settling for one interpretation. He is the greatest of directors, he justifies cinema ... In &quot;Renoir, My Father&quot; and in his own autobiography, &quot;My Life and My Films,&quot; Jean clearly adopts his father&#x27;s wish to float on life like a cork. That same stream carries Boudu away to freedom, wrinkles with pain at the end of &quot;Partie de campagne&quot;, overflows and engenders precarious existence in &quot;The Southerner&quot;, and is meaning itself in &quot;The River&quot;:

The river runs, the round world spins

Dawn and lamplight, midnight, noon.

Sun follows day, night stars and moon.

The day ends, the end begins.&quot;

<text>In contract bridge and similar games, a finesse is a type of card play technique which will enable a player to win an additional trick or tricks should there be a favorable position of one or more cards in the hands of the opponents.

The player attempts to win either the current trick or a later trick with a card of the suit he leads notwithstanding that the opponents hold a higher card in the suit; the attempt is based on the assumption that the higher card is held by a particular opponent. The specifics of the technique vary depending upon the suit combination being played and the number of tricks the player is attempting to win in that suit.

== Terminology ==
To &quot;finesse a card&quot; is to play that card.

Thus, in the example, the Queen is finessed. The outstanding King is the card finessed &quot;against&quot;, or the card the player hopes to capture by the finessing maneuver. Thus, you finesse against a missing honor, but you finesse the card you yourself play, the card finessed being so played that it has a chance of winning against the missing higher card.

;Related terms
A finesse is said to be &quot;onside&quot; or &quot;on&quot; if the finessable honor is favorably placed and &quot;offside&quot; or &quot;off&quot; if it is not.

Many finesses involve a which is a combination of non-touching honors in the same hand, e.g.  A Q or  K J.

The term &quot;hook&quot; is a colloquialism for finesse. Similarly, &quot;in the slot&quot; is a colloquialism for onside.

==Basic finesses==

=== Direct finesse ===
A direct finesse is a finesse that gains a trick without losing one, as long as it is &quot;on&quot;. For example:

If South (declarer) is on lead he can &quot;lead to the queen&quot;; that is, he leads a small spade and, if West plays low, plays the queen from dummy. If West is holding the king (it is &quot;onside&quot;), North-South will win two tricks, for a gain of one trick without losing a trick. (If West actually plays the king on the first trick, of course, North-South win two tricks by covering with the ace.)

===Indirect finesse===
An indirect finesse is a finesse that gains a trick – if it is on – but may involve losing a trick first. A typical example is:

South leads a spade toward the king; if West holds the ace, the king will either win the current trick or will become the highest remaining spade and win a later one. (More precisely, the king is set up as a winner, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it will necessarily take a trick. It might be ruffed, or at No Trump the defense might run another suit for a squeeze and force it to be discarded. But this article is about finesses, and having acknowledged that such issues exist, we will ignore them henceforth.)

===Double and triple finesse===
A double finesse is a finesse against two honours held by the opponents. Sometimes it can gain two tricks:

South leads a spade to the 10; if it holds, he reenters his hand via another suit and leads another spade to the queen; if the 10 loses and he subsequently regains the lead in his hand, he likewise leads another spade to the queen. North-South will take three spade tricks if West has both the king and the jack (probability about 25% in the absence of any information), two if East and West have one each (50%), but only one if East has both (25%).

Other times it can gain one trick:

South leads a spade to the 10. Assuming it loses, he reenters his hand and then leads another spade to the jack. North-South will take two spade tricks if West has either the king or the queen, or both (probability about 75% in the absence of any information), but only one if East has both (25%). However, this combination lends itself to an endplay - if one can be effected two tricks are guaranteed.

Similarly, a triple finesse is possible, and occasionally desirable, with a holding such as A-Q-10-8. This would be a low-probability desperation play if four tricks are needed in the suit, but two or three will probably be made.

===Deep finesse===
A deep finesse is a maneuver that allows additional tricks to be won, but only if two or more cards are favorably positioned. 
 In the first example at left, two honors are held by the opponents. South leads a spade and inserts the 10 if West plays low. South will gain a trick if both the queen and the jack are with West. Note that if there are no entries back to the South hand, West can assure himself one trick (provided he started with at least three spades) by splitting his honors and playing the queen or jack, on South&#x27;s first lead. The deep finesse has an &quot;a priori&quot; probability of success of 25%.
 This second example is a deep finesse against three or more cards held by the opponents. South leads a spade, West follows with the 3 or 6, and then the 7 is played from dummy. In this situation, South does not expect the 7 to win the trick, although that is a distant possibility—the 7 will win if East has a singleton 6 or 3, which would mean that West has blundered by playing his lowest card. The more likely purpose of this play is to keep West off lead. The term &quot;deep finesse&quot; used in this context is descriptive, but also has a somewhat humorous and fatalistic connotation, the approximate meaning being &quot;doomed finesse.&quot;

Deep Finesse is also the trade name of a commercially marketed computer program that performs double dummy analysis of bridge play problems.

===Ruffing finesse===
The ruffing finesse is a variation of a finesse in trump contracts where the finessing player chooses to ruff or not, rather than choosing which card to play from a tenace.
 In this example, hearts are trumps and South&#x27;s 2 is the last one remaining, and the lead is with North (dummy). Then North-South can take all tricks if East holds the ace of spades. A spade is led from the North hand; if East plays low, a diamond is discarded and the lead is repeated. If East never covers, North-South get three spade tricks and a trump. If East plays the ace, South trumps and leads a club to return to the dummy, which is high, so taking two spades, a trump, and a club trick.


==Special cases==

=== Marked finesse ===
 A &quot;marked finesse&quot; is one that cannot lose, because the opponents&#x27; honor is known to be onside. In the example at right, if South begins by leading the king-queen, he learns on the second trick that East has no more spades and so the finesse of the ten is proven.

===Two-way finesse===
A &quot;two-way finesse&quot; is a situation where one can finesse by leading from either hand toward the other.

Start by playing the king of spades (or if in dummy, leading the 2 to the king) and then running the jack; this makes three spade tricks if East has the singleton queen or if West has the queen, and if that&#x27;s not the case, then East will be on lead. Or start with the ace and 10, making three tricks in the opposite situation, or leaving West on lead. The decision of which way to finesse might be based on which opponent is more likely to have the queen, or on which opponent it would be safer to give the lead to, if need be. And there is always the option of not finessing at all.

This holding similarly presents a two-way finesse, but along with a suitable entry it will always produce 5 spade tricks no matter how the opponents&#x27; spades are placed.

Play the ace on the first spade trick. If both opponents follow suit, the jack must drop and no finesse will be needed; if one opponent shows out, there is a marked finesse available against the other. For example, if East shows out, a small spade is played to the queen, and the K and 10 score via the marked finesse; finally the South hand is entered in another suit and the 13th spade is cashed (or if spades are trump, used for a ruff).

But weaken the holding slightly and the finesse is no longer two-way:
 Now the opponents have the jack and 10. Here, if entry considerations permit, the queen &quot;must&quot; be played first to discover if the spades split 4-0. Then, if they are 3-1, the play goes as before.

But if the spades split 4-0, someone has J 10 7 6. If East holds all four outstanding spades, there is nothing to be done; East must take a spade trick. But if West has all four spades, declarer can still take 5 tricks: after East shows out on the lead of the queen, a small spade is led toward dummy for a deep finesse.

The point is that if an opponent might hold two minor honors, such as the jack and 10 here, declarer should not weaken a two-honor holding before it&#x27;s clear how to use it. In this example, nothing is lost by cashing the queen first, because declarer can never cope with those four spades in East&#x27;s hand. But declarer can cope with four spades in the West hand, so long as the A-K is retained over West&#x27;s holding until West has played to the second spade trick.

===Two-way position with a ruffing finesse===
As noted above, a ruffing finesse is &quot;on&quot; if the opponents&#x27; critical honor is positioned after yours, the reverse of an ordinary finesse. Consequently, there is a form of two-way finesse where a ruffing finesse can be taken against one opponent or an ordinary finesse against the other. If there is no other reason to choose one play or the other, the ruffing finesse may be a superior alternative because it allows leading high and retain the lead. For example: 
East plays a contract of 4 hearts. After the opening lead of a diamond, he wins the ace and plays the two top trumps; they break 3-2. He leads a spade to the queen, but the finesse is off, and the opponents now cash two diamonds. With a trump still to lose, the contract appears to be down one.

However, the contract is cold as long as trumps break 3-2 and the defense cannot get an early ruff. The correct play is to win the ace of diamonds and to continue with the ace of spades, followed by the queen for a ruffing finesse. If North does not cover with the king, declarer pitches a losing diamond. If North does play the king, declarer ruffs and later pitches a diamond on the jack of spades. Even if the king is with South, declarer loses 3 tricks only, if trumps are 3-2. And if trumps are 4-1 the game will still make if the king of spades is sitting with North. The advantage of the ruffing finesse over the ordinary finesse here is the gain of tempo if it loses.

===Ann Gallagher finesse===
An &quot;Ann Gallagher finesse&quot; is a special sort of two-way finesse. Instead of deciding which way to finesse, though, declarer finesses both ways. This is the classic example:

 Against South&#x27;s 4 contract, West leads the K, removing an entry that might have proven useful later. South leads the 2 from dummy and finesses the J. West can see that, with the clubs probably running, South will have no problem if West wins his Q. So West ducks smoothly.

A trusting player sitting South would now lead the 8 to the K, preparing to finesse East again for the Q, but East&#x27;s discard would come as a shock. After taking the K, South can&#x27;t knock out West&#x27;s Q without allowing the defense to take at least two spades, a heart and a diamond.

After the J wins at trick 2, South&#x27;s &quot;only&quot; correct play is to finesse West for the Q, even though he has apparently and successfully finessed East for the same card. The point is to guard against West&#x27;s clever holdup.

The reason for the term &quot;Ann Gallagher finesse&quot; is found in a New York Times article. Ann Gallagher was a movie actress in the 1930s. She enjoyed bridge, and when she won a two-way finesse she would repeat it in the opposite direction, saying &quot;Now let&#x27;s see if I&#x27;m really lucky.&quot;

===Free finesse===
A so-called &quot;free finesse&quot; is not technically a finesse at all, as it is not dependent on the position of the opponents&#x27; cards, but only on their choice of lead. A free finesse occurs when an opponent leads a suit, so that the hand containing a tenace position plays last to the trick. In the first example:

the normal finesse only works if West has the king, but if East leads spades, the declarer simply plays the lowest card that will win the trick, and so gets two tricks no matter whether East or West has the king. Similarly, in the first two-way finesse example, three spade tricks are taken automatically on a free finesse if either East or West is the first to lead spades.

Free finesses often happen due to the defense guessing wrong about high cards in declarer&#x27;s hand, especially on the opening lead. But it is also possible to &quot;force&quot; the defense to give you a free finesse, by endplaying them. Consider the two-way finesse example again, but with an additional card:

Nobody has played any spades at any point, so the defense is known to have 7 of them, and their other card is known to be a heart. Declarer leads a heart, losing to whichever defender holds the high heart; and that defender is now on lead with nothing but spades. North-South will take 3 spade tricks for certain, and declarer need not guess which way to finesse the suit.
===Entry finesse===
At times, declarer needs to reach the same hand twice using a particular suit, but that hand doesn&#x27;t hold the suit&#x27;s two top cards. 
 In this example, declarer needs to reach the North hand twice by means of the spade suit.

Normally, declarer would cash the A and K separately. However, two spade entries to North might be needed, for reasons such as setting up North&#x27;s side suit or preparing an endplay. If West holds the Q, declarer can reach dummy twice with an &quot;entry finesse&quot;: lead the 10 from hand and finesse the J. If the J holds, the K can later be overtaken by the A for the second entry to dummy. If West is aware of what&#x27;s going on, though, he can stop it by covering the 10 with the Q. Now the suit is blocked, because the J cannot overtake the K. As with many deceptive plays, declarer should take the entry finesse as early in the play as possible, before the defense realizes it must play second hand &quot;high&quot; to block the suit.

==Complex finesses==
Some positions require correct reading of opponent&#x27;s holding, and involve a combination of basic finesses with other techniques, such as dropping or pinning opponent&#x27;s honors.

===Backward finesse===
In the backward finesse, the player attempts to force out a higher card in a suit by means of a high-leading finesse, and then finesses against a lower card in the suit.
In the example on the right, the standard play would be to finesse East for the queen, either before or after cashing dummy&#x27;s ace. Instead, in the backward finesse South, begins by leading the jack from hand and passes it if West plays low thereby scoring all three tricks in the suit. But if West covers the jack with the queen, South takes the trick with the ace and then leads the 4 from dummy and finesses East for the 10, again winning all three tricks.

There are three reasons that South might choose to play this way, rather than taking the normal course of finessing East for the queen:
*South might expect West to hold the queen because of the bidding or some similar clue.
*South might want to make an avoidance play, so as to keep West off lead.
*South might be shooting, hoping to score well by adopting a line of play that other declarers will not take.

===Intra-finesse===
Finesses which involve a second-round drop or pin are sometimes referred to as &quot;intra-finesses&quot;.

In the first diagram, the declarer must lead a small card from hand towards the dummy&#x27;s jack for an &quot;indirect&quot; finesse. If West plays the queen, East&#x27;s king can be finessed against in the next round. If West ducks, the declarer will drop the queen by playing the ace. In the second, the declarer must lead a small card from dummy and play the 10 if East plays low. In the second round, the ace will drop the king.

In these and similar cases, declarer&#x27;s first play must be a low card through the hand with two cards; thus, he must guess the position to collect three tricks in the suit.

In the third diagram where declarer also requires three spade tricks, he must first lead low to the dummy&#x27;s 9, losing to East&#x27;s 10. Next, the ace drops the jack, and leaves a simple-finesse position against East&#x27;s queen in the third round. Note that this maneuver will work with any doubleton honor with West, but will cost if West holds QJx, Q10x, or J10x

==Pseudo-finesse==
A pseudo or &quot;Chinese&quot; finesse presents a declarer&#x27;s deceptive move to fake a high-leading finesse by leading an unprotected honor, hoping that the defender will misread the situation. 
 Consider the legitimate finesse situation at left:
If South leads the queen first, and West covers, the declarer will be able to subsequently finesse against East&#x27;s ten, losing no tricks in the suit. Thus, West should withhold the king for one round.

 However, in the alternative situation:
If South leads the queen and West ducks, the declarer will lose only one trick in the suit instead of two.
==Coups involving a finesse==

=== Bath coup ===
This specific case of a free finesse is important enough to have its own name (after the city of Bath in England). It occurs when the declarer holds a suit headed by A-J-x and the left-hand opponent leads the king or queen of the suit. If the declarer ducks and the opponent now repeats the lead, two tricks will be won with the ace-jack.

The Bath coup is not just a deceptive play. Even if the suit is not continued, the declarer gains a tempo, since he still has a sure stopper in that suit.

===Trump coup and coup en passant===
In positions where a finesse in trumps cannot be taken because the hand that would need to lead trumps has none, a trump coup or coup en passant may be used. See those articles.

==Suit combinations==
The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge lists suit combinations and how best to play them depending on how many tricks are needed. Players do not need to memorize these and can usually deduce the correct play at the table. However, it is worthwhile to study the suit combinations tables, having in mind that the optimal play in a suit may not be best in the context of the entire hand.

<doc id="105340" wikidata="Q6763" url="?curid=105340" title="Strange quark">
<text>The strange quark or s quark (from its symbol, s) is the third lightest of all quarks, a type of elementary particle. Strange quarks are found in subatomic particles called hadrons. Examples of hadrons containing strange quarks include kaons (), strange D mesons (), Sigma baryons (), and other strange particles.

According to the IUPAP, the symbol s is the official name, while &quot;strange&quot; is to be considered only as a mnemonic. The name sideways has also been used because the s quark (but also the other three remaining quarks) has an I value of 0 while the u (&quot;up&quot;) and d (&quot;down&quot;) quarks have values of + and − respectively.

Along with the charm quark, it is part of the second generation of matter. It has an electric charge of  &quot;e&quot; and a bare mass of . Like all quarks, the strange quark is an elementary fermion with spin , and experiences all four fundamental interactions: gravitation, electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions. The antiparticle of the strange quark is the strange antiquark (sometimes called &quot;antistrange quark&quot; or simply &quot;antistrange&quot;), which differs from it only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.

The first strange particle (a particle containing a strange quark) was discovered by George Rochester and Clifford Butler in Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester in 1947 (kaons), with the existence of the strange quark itself (and that of the up and down quarks) postulated in 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig to explain the &quot;eightfold way&quot; classification scheme of hadrons. The first evidence for the existence of quarks came in 1968, in deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. These experiments confirmed the existence of up and down quarks, and by extension, strange quarks, as they were required to explain the &quot;eightfold way&quot;.

== History ==
In the beginnings of particle physics (first half of the 20th century), hadrons such as protons, neutrons and pions were thought to be elementary particles. However, new hadrons were discovered and the &quot;particle zoo&quot; grew from a few particles in the early 1930s and 1940s to several dozens of them in the 1950s. Some particles were much longer lived than others; most particles decayed through the strong interaction and had lifetimes of around 10−23 seconds. When they decayed through the weak interactions, they had lifetimes of around 10−10 seconds. While studying these decays, Murray Gell-Mann (in 1953) and Kazuhiko Nishijima (in 1955) developed the concept of &quot;strangeness&quot; (which Nishijima called &quot;eta-charge&quot;, after the eta meson ()) to explain the &quot;strangeness&quot; of the longer-lived particles. The Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula is the result of these efforts to understand strange decays.

Despite their work, the relationships between each particle and the physical basis behind the strangeness property remained unclear. In 1961, Gell-Mann and Yuval Ne&#x27;eman independently proposed a hadron classification scheme called the eightfold way, also known as SU(3) flavor symmetry. This ordered hadrons into isospin multiplets. The physical basis behind both isospin and strangeness was only explained in 1964, when Gell-Mann and George Zweig independently proposed the quark model, which at that time consisted only of the up, down, and strange quarks. Up and down quarks were the carriers of isospin, while the strange quark carried strangeness. While the quark model explained the &quot;eightfold way&quot;, no direct evidence of the existence of quarks was found until 1968 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Deep inelastic scattering experiments indicated that protons had substructure, and that protons made of three more-fundamental particles explained the data (thus confirming the quark model).

At first people were reluctant to identify the three-bodies as quarks, instead preferring Richard Feynman&#x27;s parton description, but over time the quark theory became accepted (see &quot;November Revolution&quot;).

<text>The Myyrmanni bombing took place on October 11, 2002, in Myyrmäki, Vantaa, Finland, in Greater Helsinki, at the Myyrmanni shopping mall. A bomb was hidden in a backpack, which exploded in the central square of the shopping center on top of a metal waste container, located in the center of the square, at 19:36. Five people were instantly killed, including the bomber. The waste container was shattered, and fragments of the structure increased the amount of shrapnel and the devastation. The explosion ruined 400 m2 of the shopping center, carved a 10-cm deep crater in the floor where the waste container had stood and blew the glass dome over the square up and outwards from the mall. In total seven died, including two teenagers and a seven-year-old. 159 were injured, including 10 children. 66 victims required hospitalization with the remainder treated and released at the scene. The bombing took place during the pre-weekend shopping surge late on a Friday afternoon, with 1,000–2,000 people in the shopping center, including many children who had come to see a clown performance.

==Details==
The bomb carrier was Petri Erkki Tapio Gerdt (April 17, 1983 – October 11, 2002), a 19-year-old chemical engineering student at the Espoo-Vantaa Institute of Technology (EVTEK). Described as quiet and somewhat withdrawn, Gerdt was an amateur bomb-maker with no known close friends. He participated in basketball and had no prior criminal record. Gerdt died in the explosion he caused.
 He was also an active member of &quot;Kotikemia&quot; (lit. &quot;home chemistry&quot;), an online forum for amateur chemists. The moderator of Kotikemia was acquitted of responsibility in court. The explosive device was likely constructed in Gerdt&#x27;s apartment. It was a 1.5 liter plastic bottle that contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane with shotgun pellets and weighed about . Investigations revealed that some kind of timer was also used. Kotikemia was shut down by the authorities following the bombing.

== Investigation ==
The Finnish National Bureau of Investigation investigated the event as six accounts of murder, one account of aggravated criminal mischief and one account of an explosives offence. The case was closed in January 2003 without any indictments as Gerdt was the sole suspect. Gerdt&#x27;s motive for the bombing was not ascertained during the investigation. There was no evidence found that Gerdt had links to any outside groups or to any international terrorist organizations.


==Aftermath==
On October 15, 2002, Finland observed a national day of mourning in response to the tragic events. Government buildings were closed, a moment of silence was observed in Parliament, and flags across the country were flown at half-staff to honor the victims. The shopping center was closed for repairs for nearly three weeks before re-opening later in October.

The bombing was especially shocking for Finland and the other Nordic countries, where these type of attacks are extremely rare.

==Legacy==
Petri Gerdt&#x27;s father, Armas, wrote the book &quot;Petrin matka Myyrmanniin&quot; (&quot;Petri&#x27;s Road to Myyrmanni&quot;) about the incident.

<text>Royal Jordanian Airlines (formerly known as Alia Royal Jordanian Airlines) is the flag carrier of Jordan with its head office in the capital, Amman. The airline operates scheduled international services over four continents from its main base at Queen Alia International Airport, with over 500 flights per week and at least 110 daily departures. It joined the Oneworld airline alliance in 2007.

== History ==
=== 1960s to 1990s ===
The airline was established on 9 December 1963 and started operations on 15 December 1963 after a royal decree by the late King Hussein. It was named &quot;Alia&quot; (or &quot;Aalya&quot;) after King Hussein&#x27;s eldest child, Princess Alia bint Al Hussein of Jordan (born on 13 February 1956). It is a common misconception that the airline was named after the King&#x27;s third wife, Queen Alia, whom King Hussein did not marry until 1972. The airline was founded with capital from private shareholders but the Jordanian government later took over the company.

Alia (the Royal Jordanian Airline) started operations with two Handley Page Dart Heralds and a Douglas DC-7 aircraft, serving Kuwait City, Beirut and Cairo from Amman. In 1964, another DC-7 was added and service began to Jeddah. In 1965, Alia initiated service to Rome, its first destination in Europe. The progress made by the airline was threatened by an Israeli air raid during the 1967 Six-Day War when the DC-7 aircraft were destroyed. They were replaced by two Fokker F27 Friendship airliners.

In 1968, the airline joined the jet age when it introduced the Sud Aviation Caravelle, and expanded the route network to Nicosia, Benghazi, Dhahran and Doha. 1969 saw the addition of service to Munich, Istanbul and Tehran.
In 1970, Alia phased out the F27s and ordered Boeing 707 aircraft. Frankfurt and Abu Dhabi were added to the network. The 707s were delivered in 1971. In that year, service was initiated to Madrid, Copenhagen and Karachi. During the rest of the decade, Boeing 720s, Boeing 727s, and Boeing 747s were added to the fleet. A catering department was established, and duty-free shops were opened at Amman airport. Services were added to destinations including Bahrain, Dubai, Muscat, Rabat, Geneva, Amsterdam, Baghdad, Bangkok, Vienna, Damascus, New York City, Houston, and Ras al-Khaimah. In 1979, Alia became a founding member of the Arab Airlines Technical Consortium (AATC).

In the 1980s, Tunis and Tripoli joined the route map, and Alia&#x27;s IBM computer center was inaugurated. Lockheed L-1011 Tristars, Airbus A310s and Airbus A320s joined the fleet. In December 1986, Alia changed its name to Royal Jordanian Airlines, when Princess Alia was nearing her divorce. The airline&#x27;s first woman pilot flew one of their aircraft during this decade. Service was added to Belgrade, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, Bucharest, Singapore, Riyadh, Kuala Lumpur – in cooperation with MAS, Sana&#x27;a, Moscow. Montreal, Delhi, Calcutta and Ankara. This decade also saw the introduction of the Gabriel Automated Ticket System – (GATS).

The 1990s saw further expansion. Royal Jordanian and nine other Arab air carriers signed up for the Galileo CRS. The IMCS maintenance and engineering system was added, a new Amman city air terminal was opened at the 7th Circle of the Jordanian capital, and services to Rafah started, since then halted. The cities of Toronto, Colombo, Jakarta, Berlin, Mumbai, Milan and Tel Aviv were added to the network. In November 1997, Royal Jordanian became a code-sharing partner with the US carrier Trans World Airlines and moved operations into the TWA Flight Center (Terminal 5) at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.

=== 2000 and beyond, and privatization ===
In 2000, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) renewed the airline&#x27;s maintenance and engineering department&#x27;s license. The duty-free shop was among the services to be privatised. A holding company, RJI, wholly owned by the government, was incorporated as a public limited company in February 2001 to hold all the airlines and associated investments. The airline&#x27;s name was changed on 5 February 2001 to &quot;Alia – The Royal Jordanian Airlines Company&quot;, although travellers still use the popular name of Royal Jordanian.

The flag carrier&#x27;s subsidiary Royal Wings operated an Airbus A320-212 aircraft on both scheduled and charter services to destinations in Egypt, Cyprus, and Israel.

On 20 December 2006, Royal Jordanian announced that they would replace two Airbus A321s with two new units, and order four new Airbus A319s to enter service in early 2008.

In April 2007, Royal Jordanian became part of Oneworld, thus becoming the first Arab airline to join such a global alliance system. The following month, the airline announced an order for a total of 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, for service entry in 2010. This is the first order Royal Jordanian has placed with Boeing.

Montreal was re-added to the network on 25 May 2007, after the route was cancelled in 1997. Also during May, Royal Jordanian was the sponsor of the World Economic Forum, which was held at the Dead Sea, Jordan.

On 11 July 2007, Royal Jordanian celebrated thirty years of non-stop service between Amman and New York City, making it the longest-serving Arab airline to this gateway to the U.S. RJ won the &quot;Airline Strategy Award&quot; in the technology category at the sixth annual Airline Strategy Awards on 16 July 2007. On 23 July, RJ saw the introduction of cargo flights, Damascus being the first destination served from Amman, using a Boeing 737.

Royal Jordanian made its first flight to Budapest, on 28 July, using an Embraer 195. In October, RJ announced the switch of two Embraer 195 jets of its original order to two Embraer 175 jets. Royal Jordanian opened a new lounge at King Hussein International Airport in Aqaba.

RJ will be the first Middle East airline to provide its passengers with OnAir&#x27;s in-flight Internet and mobile phone services, including e-mail, SMS and voice calls. Royal Jordanian has upgraded its three Airbus A310s at a cost of over 10 million Jordanian dinars (JOD).

Royal Jordanian was privatized at the end of 2007, resulting in 71% of its assets being sold. The market capitalization of the company stands at 260 million JOD, and share-trading commenced on 17 December 2007.

On 24 December 2007, Royal Jordanian confirmed Baku as one of its new destinations for 2008, using an Embraer 195 twice weekly from Amman. In early 2008, however, RJ officials decided against the new route, citing that high fuel prices and a new market were a risk too large to take at that time. Royal Jordanian plans to operate the Amman-Baku route in late 2009 or early 2010. On 22 January 2008, RJ launched flights to Hong Kong via Bangkok, with three flights/week during winter, and five flights/week during summer, making it the airline&#x27;s first route to China.

The Airbus A319 entered service on 13 March 2008, making RJ the first Middle East airline to operate three aircraft of the Airbus A320 family. On 17 August 2008, Royal Jordanian opened a new route to Kyiv, using Embraer 195 jets for this twice-weekly service. On 24 August 2008, Royal Jordanian opened its new lounge at Queen Alia International Airport Amman, replacing the &quot;Petra&quot; and &quot;Jerash&quot; lounges. The new lounge is located on the second floor of the South Terminal and is the second-largest airport lounge in the Middle East, being able to handle over 340 passengers.

The airline recorded an 18% increase in passenger numbers in July 2008. With the airline transporting 278,000 passengers, the seat factor grew by 5% in that month to reach 81%. As part of Royal Jordanian&#x27;s commitment to its airline alliance Oneworld, an announcement was made at the alliance&#x27;s 10th birthday celebrations on 3 February 2009 that RJ would paint its new A319 (due for delivery in late March) in a scheme that would be based around the Oneworld name and logo. This is the first special colour scheme Royal Jordanian will have used.

Royal Jordanian resumed service to Brussels on 1 April 2009, six years after the route was discontinued by the airline, flying twice weekly from Amman with the airline planning to add a further two flights per week later in 2009.

On 28 March 2010, Royal Jordanian inaugurated regular direct flights to Madinah Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia, with four weekly flights. On the 23 March, Royal Jordanian confirmed that it had ordered two A330-200s and one Embraer 175. Royal Jordanian recommenced operations to Malaysia&#x27;s capital Kuala Lumpur on June 2, 2010, after it had suspended this route in 2004. Aircraft used on this route is the new Airbus A330-200 and later switched to Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

In May 2011, Royal Jordanian announced that they will retire the Airbus A310 aircraft in December 2011, and January 2012. Royal Jordanian uses an Airbus A330 and an Airbus A321 for non-stop flights to London (Heathrow Terminal 3).
In June 2014, Royal Jordanian announced that it had suspended services to Mosul in northern Iraq due to the capture of the airport by the Islamic State.

The first of Royal Jordanian&#x27;s Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft (267-seat, two-class configuration) entered service in September 2014, initially linking Amman with Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The 787 Dreamliner is Royal Jordanian&#x27;s first Boeing aircraft since the 707s and 747s, and replaced the Airbus A340-200s which had reached the end of their lives. The Dreamliners have replaced the Airbus A330-200s as leases on those aircraft have expired. The Dreamliners are generally used on Royal Jordanian&#x27;s Far East destinations, to London and North America.

In May 2017, Royal Jordanian announced the appointment of Stefan Pichler, the ex CEO of Air Berlin, Fiji Airways, Jazeera Airways, Virgin Australia and Thomas Cook as the new president and CEO.
Pichler developed a turnaround plan which helped moving Royal Jordanian back into profitability by the end of 2017. In this context, the airline cancelled the order of the 8th Dreamliner and also withdrew the A330F from its Cargo fleet for similar reasons. The CEO also stated that the strategy of Royal Jordanian would lead to a single type narrow-body fleet, not mentioning whether it will be Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, or Embraer. In September 2020, Pichler resigned from his duties which were taken over by Chairman Saeed Samih Darwazah.

On 17 January 2025, the airline announced the re-introduction of direct flights between Amman and Damascus commencing 31 January 2025, following a hiatus of 13 years. The service will operate four weekly flights with daily flights to begin in April 2025. Royal Jordanian join Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines to resume flight operations to Syria.

== Corporate affairs ==
=== Head office ===
, Haddadinco Engineering Company for Contracting is building the new Royal Jordanian head office in Amman. The building was designed by Niels Torp. The new building was completed in late 2011, and RJ employees began work in the building on January 3, 2012. In the 1960s, Alia&#x27;s head office was in the Mango Building in Amman.

=== Employment ===
Royal Jordanian has invested heavily in its crew training facility at its headquarters in Amman. , Royal Jordanian employed 4,394 people, according to the most recent annual report.

=== Rivalry ===
Royal Jordanian began to put into place a new strategy at the end of 2002 which saw the airline concentrate on its neighboring nations, with increased frequencies. In a plan to establish itself as the Middle East&#x27;s &quot;regional airline&quot; it began to add smaller routes such as Alexandria in Egypt to Aleppo in Syria which the bigger airlines, such as Emirates, would not undertake with the larger aircraft compared to Royal Jordanian&#x27;s regional jets. As of the end of 2008, the plan had proven successful for the airline, with its main rivals being Middle East Airlines and Egypt Air.

Since 2008, Royal Jordanian has faced increased competition within the Middle East. The arrival of many new low-cost airlines such as Air Arabia, Jazeera Airways, and flydubai have caused problems for the Jordanian airline. With the arrival of these new airlines, Royal Jordanian has focused upon improving its onboard and ground services in order to retain market share.

=== Business figures ===
The key trends for Royal Jordanian are (as at the financial year ending December 31):
== Destinations ==
=== Codeshare agreements ===
Royal Jordanian codeshares with the following airlines:

* American Airlines
* British Airways
* Etihad Airways
* Gulf Air
* ITA Airways
* Malaysia Airlines
* Oman Air
* Qatar Airways
* TAROM
* Turkish Airlines 
== Fleet ==
=== Current fleet ===

, the Royal Jordanian fleet consists of the following aircraft:

=== Former fleet ===
Royal Jordanian previously operated the following aircraft types:

=== Livery ===

From 1963 to 1986, the original livery of Royal Jordanian Airlines consisted of a white fuselage with both red and gold cheatlines.

In December 1986, the airline changed its name from Alia Royal Jordanian Airlines to simply Royal Jordanian Airlines, which coincided the arrival of Airbus A310 and Airbus A320 airliners. The new livery consisted of a charcoal grey fuselage with the same red and gold cheatlines, similar to the earlier version. The tail consists of a golden crown with a red tip on the charcoal grey coloured aircraft tail.

=== Special color schemes ===
Until 2009, Royal Jordanian had never had an aircraft painted in a special colour scheme. It announced at the 10th birthday celebrations in February 2009 of the airline alliance Oneworld that it would paint its new A319 due for delivery in late March in a special scheme, which would be based around the Oneworld name and logo. The aircraft, registration JY-AYP, has its fuselage painted white, with the tailfin and engines in normal Royal Jordanian colours. &quot;A member of Oneworld&quot; in prominent lettering is located at the front of the aircraft, with the usual title &quot;Royal Jordanian&quot; further back. However, the aircraft was stored in October 2024 and subsequently retired by the airline.
In October 2021, Royal Jordanian unveiled &quot;Discover Petra&quot; special livery on one of its Boeing 787 Dreamliners, registered JY-BAH.

A month later, in November 2021, the airline revealed an Airbus A321, JY-AYV, in its retro &quot;Alia&quot; livery. The aircraft&#x27;s first flight in the new paint scheme was to London Heathrow.

== Services ==
=== Catering ===
Food and drinks served on flights leaving Amman are provided by Dnata. Hot meals will be served on a flight of at least three hours in length. If the flight is shorter than one hour, the cabin crew will provide snacks and drinks throughout, or before, the flight. These flights include those to Tel Aviv, Cairo, Baghdad, Beirut and Aqaba from Amman.

=== In-flight entertainment ===
Royal Jordanian&#x27;s onboard entertainment system is called &quot;Sky Cinema&quot;.
* In Economy Class on board the Airbus and Boeing aircraft all passengers are supplied with personal televisions (PTV), the system is audio- and video-on-demand system (AVOD). The system provides passengers with a selection of movies, television shows, audio and games.
* In Crown Class, passengers are provided with AVOD which includes a large library of movies, television shows, audio and games on board the Airbus and Boeing aircraft. Portable entertainment devices (IMS) are only available for Crown Class passengers flying on Embraer aircraft. The IMS service is provided on all international flights. The IMS library contains movies, short subjects, an audio library and games.

Interactive games are available in all classes on all flights, as well as news provided by CNN on all flights. On very short flights (from Amman to Tel Aviv, Beirut or Damascus), the AVOD system is turned on but there is only the selection of games, CNN News, the &quot;Flight Show&quot;, and the comedy channel. This is due to the flights being less than 45 minutes hence movies/shows would not be complete upon arrival.

=== Seating ===
Crown Class seats on Boeing 787s are fully flat beds. Seat pitch is 83 inches on the Dreamliners and 46 inches on the short and medium haul aircraft. In Economy Class, Royal Jordanian offers 32-inch seat pitch on board its Embraer aircraft, whilst it offers 34-inch seat pitch on board its Airbus aircraft. All Royal Jordanian Economy class seats also offer a foot-rest.

=== Crown Class lounges ===
Crown Class passengers can use lounges across the world including all Oneworld member airline lounges. Royal Jordanian operates two lounges: one in Amman, at Queen Alia International Airport, and one at Aqaba, at King Hussein International Airport. In August 2008, Royal Jordanian opened its new lounge, which can handle over 340 passengers. It is located in the South Terminal on the second floor and replaces the previous Jerash and Petra lounges in the airport.

=== Frequent-flyer program ===
Royal Club is Royal Jordanian&#x27;s frequent flyer program. Passengers are awarded miles based on the type, class of flight and destination. Royal Club members can also get miles by traveling on other Oneworld airlines. Card holders of Royal Jordanian&#x27;s Royal Plus with either Silver, Gold or Platinum can use Oneworld airport services across the world while Gold and Platinum also have lounge access.

== Accidents and incidents ==
Royal Jordanian has experienced 13 aviation occurrences and six hijackings throughout its history, four of them fatal. The airline&#x27;s two worst accidents, both involving chartered Boeing 707s, happened in Nigeria in 1973 and Morocco in 1975, and to date are both the deadliest accidents in those countries and the deadliest worldwide involving the 707.
*On April 10, 1965, all 54 passengers and crew aboard an ALIA Handley Page HPR-7 Herald 207 died after their plane crashed into a mountain near Damascus, Syria as a result of a structural failure of the fuselage in flight.
*On January 22, 1973, 176 people were killed when an ALIA Boeing 707 was landing at Kano, Nigeria.
*On August 3, 1975, all 188 people on board were killed when an ALIA Boeing 707 struck a mountain ridge while making its approach for a landing in Morocco.
*On March 14, 1979, 45 of the 64 persons aboard an ALIA Boeing 727 were killed as a result of a windshear on landing at the Doha International Airport in Qatar.
*On June 11, 1985, Fawaz Younis and four Amal Movement men hijacked Flight 402, a Boeing 727, forcing the plane to and from Beirut and Jordan. 13 hours later, after releasing the passengers, the hijackers blew up the plane.

Since the name of the carrier was changed to Royal Jordanian Airlines in 1986, the only fatal incident was when a hijacker, seeking political asylum, was killed by the on-board security agent on 5 July 2000, on board a Royal Jordanian Airbus A320 flying from Amman to Damascus.

<doc id="105345" wikidata="Q3491799" url="?curid=105345" title="Squeeze play (bridge)">
<text>A squeeze play (or squeeze) is a technique used in contract bridge and other trick-taking games in which the play of a card (the &quot;squeeze card&quot;) forces an opponent to discard a winner or the guard of a potential winner. The situation typically occurs in the end game, with only a few cards remaining. Although numerous types of squeezes have been analyzed and catalogued in contract bridge, they were first discovered and described in whist.

Most squeezes operate on the principle that declarer&#x27;s and dummy&#x27;s hands can, between them, hold more cards with the potential to take extra tricks than a single defender&#x27;s hand can protect or &quot;guard&quot;. Infrequently, due to the difficulty of coordinating their holdings, two defenders can cooperate to squeeze declarer or dummy on the same principle.

==Context==

===Complexity===
Squeeze plays are considered by many &quot;to be the domain of the experts but many of the positions are straightforward once the basic principles are understood.&quot; And according to Terence Reese, the squeeze play &quot;in its practical aspects is not particularly difficult. It takes time, admittedly...and has...to be learned – it cannot be &#x27;picked up&#x27;&quot;.

===Significance and prevalence===
Squeeze plays are important in difficult-to-make high-level contracts and in matchpoint play where the taking of one more trick than generally achieved by the field is a real difference-maker likely to result in a top . The opportunity to employ a squeeze play arises sufficiently frequently that it is essential to learn if one aspires to become an advanced player., 

===Terminology===
* : Cards held by defenders which are winners or protecting winners.
* : Determining or assuming the location of the opponents&#x27; cards.
* The : The number of tricks that must be lost before the squeeze can function.
* : To lose the necessary number of tricks.
* Entry: A high card or trump that enables declarer to place the lead in the hand that holds, or that will hold, another card that the squeeze has established.
* : Cards that can safely be discarded by defenders (i.e., are not busy). Rectifying the count removes idle cards from the defenders&#x27; hands.
* : Cards held by declarer or dummy which start out as losers, but which may be promoted to winning rank when the squeeze forces the defense to discard its stoppers. 
* Squeeze card: The card which (when led) forces the defense to discard a busy card or cards. Before the squeeze card can bring the squeeze about, several conditions described below must be met.

==Conditions==

The most basic forms of squeeze require all the following conditions to be in place before the squeeze can operate:
* The defense&#x27;s guards in the threat suits must be held by one defender only. 
* The count has been rectified which ensures that:
**Declarer has enough winners to take all the remaining tricks but one, which is to be gained from the squeeze; and
**The defender being squeezed has no idle cards.
* Between them, declarer and dummy have threat cards in two suits that the squeeze may establish as winners:
** At least one of the threat cards must be in the hand opposite the squeeze card; and
** At least one of the threat cards must lie in the hand that plays after the squeezed defender.
* There is an entry to the threat card opposite the squeeze card.

==Examples==

==Classification==

There are several ways to classify squeezes:

* According to which opponent can be squeezed:
**In a &quot;positional&quot; squeeze, only one opponent can be squeezed.
**In an &quot;automatic&quot; squeeze, either opponent can be squeezed.
* According to number of opponents squeezed:
**In a &quot;single&quot; squeeze, only one opponent is squeezed.
**In a &quot;double&quot; squeeze, both opponents are squeezed.
* According to number of suits involved:
**In a &quot;two-suit&quot; squeeze, there are menaces in two suits.
**In a &quot;three-suit&quot; squeeze, there are menaces in three suits.
**In a &quot;compound&quot; squeeze, there are menaces in three suits (against one); then, menaces in three suits (against both opponents). It could be named a &quot;six-suit&quot; squeeze.
**The peculiar and rare &quot;single-suit squeeze&quot; is actually a type of endplay rather than a real squeeze.
* According to what is gained:
**In a &quot;material&quot; squeeze, the opponents are forced to give up a trick directly.
**In a &quot;non-material&quot; squeeze, the opponents are forced to give up strategic position. For example, an opponent can be squeezed out of an exit card or a card that disturbs declarer&#x27;s entries. An extra trick, however, may materialize later.
* According to the count rectification:
**In a squeeze &quot;with the count&quot;, the count is rectified before the squeeze card is played, and declarer will lose no more tricks. These are typically material squeezes.
**In a squeeze &quot;without the count&quot;, the count is not yet rectified. These are typically non-material squeezes, often with a throw-in in the end position.

Most of the common types of squeezes (and some of the rare ones) have names:

Alliances may provide marketing branding to facilitate travelers making inter-airline codeshare connections within countries. This branding may involve unified aircraft liveries of member aircraft.

In 2015, Star Alliance was the largest with 23% of total scheduled traffic in revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs)/revenue passenger miles (RPMs), followed by SkyTeam with 20.4% and Oneworld with 17.8%, leaving 38.8% for others. In 2019, by number of passengers, Star Alliance was leading 762 million, followed by SkyTeam (630 million) and Oneworld (535 million).

==Rationale==
Benefits can consist of an extended network, often realised through codeshare agreements. Many alliances started as only codeshare networks. Cost reductions come from sharing operation facilities (e.g. catering or computer systems), operation staff (e.g. ground handling personnel, at check-in and boarding desks), investments and purchases (e.g. in order to negotiate extra volume discounts). Traveler benefits can include lower prices due to lowered operational costs for a given route, different times to choose from, more destinations within easy reach, shorter travel times, more options of airport lounges shared with alliance members, fast track access on all alliance members if having frequent flyer status, faster mileage rewards by earning miles for a single account on several different carriers, round-the-world tickets, enabling travellers to fly over the world for a relatively low price.

Airline alliances may also create disadvantages for the traveller, such as higher prices when competition is erased on a certain route or less frequent flights; for instance, if two airlines separately fly three and two times a day respectively on a shared route, their alliance might fly less than 5 (3+2) times a day on the same route. This might be especially true between hub cities for each airline. e.g., flights between Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (a Delta Air Lines fortress hub) and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (a KLM fortress hub).

== History ==
The first airline alliance was formed in the 1930s, when Panair do Brasil and its parent company Pan American World Airways agreed to exchange routes to Latin America. In 1990, the African Joint Air Services (AJAS) Accord between Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia led to the launch of Alliance Air in 1994, with South African Airways, Air Tanzania, Uganda Airlines and the governments of Uganda and Tanzania as shareholders.

The first large alliance began in 1989, when Northwest Airlines and KLM agreed to large-scale codesharing. In 1992, the Netherlands signed the first open skies agreement with the United States, in spite of objections from the European Union, which gave both countries unrestricted landing rights on the other&#x27;s soil. Normally landing rights are granted for a fixed number of flights per week to a fixed destination. Each adjustment requires negotiations, often between governments rather than between the companies involved. In return, the United States granted antitrust immunity to the alliance between Northwest Airlines and KLM. Other alliances would struggle for years to overcome the transnational barriers and lack of antitrust immunity, and still do so.

On May 14, 1997, an agreement was announced forming the Star Alliance with five airlines on three continents: United Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines, Thai Airways International, Air Canada, and Lufthansa. The alliance chose Young &amp; Rubicam for advertising, with a budget of $25 million (€18 million). which brought competing airlines to form Oneworld in 1999 and SkyTeam in 2000.

In 2010 Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin Group, announced his intention to form a fourth alliance among Virgin branded airlines (Virgin Atlantic; Virgin America; and the Virgin Australia Holdings group of airlines). Then in September 2011, Branson said that Virgin Atlantic would join one of the existing alliances; this idea was repeated in October 2012. In December 2012, Delta Air Lines purchased Singapore Airlines&#x27; 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic for £224 million. Virgin America was absorbed into Alaska Airlines by 2018, which joined the Oneworld alliance in 2021. Meanwhile, Virgin Atlantic joined SkyTeam in 2023.

On February 14, 2013, it was announced that American Airlines and US Airways would merge, retaining the American Airlines name and would remain in the Oneworld alliance. US Airways&#x27; participation in Star Alliance lapsed. In 2012, in South America, LAN Airlines and TAM Airlines began their merger. In March 2014, with the merger complete, TAM left Star Alliance and became part of LAN in Oneworld.

On September 21, 2015, the Vanilla Alliance was formed between several airlines based in the Indian Ocean region, in order to improve air connectivity within the region. The founding members are Air Austral, Air Mauritius, Air Madagascar, Air Seychelles, and Int&#x27;Air Îles.

On January 18, 2016, the first alliance of low-cost carriers was formed, U-FLY Alliance. The founding members—HK Express, Lucky Air, Urumqi Air, and West Air—are all affiliated with HNA Group, although the alliance is also seeking airlines not within the group.

On May 16, 2016, the world&#x27;s largest alliance of low-cost carriers was formed, Value Alliance. The founding members were Cebu Pacific, Cebgo, Jeju Air, Nok Air, NokScoot, Scoot Airlines, Tigerair, Tigerair Australia, and Vanilla Air.

<text>A single-suit squeeze is a unique
squeeze play in contract bridge
that occurs with an awkward defensive distribution of one suit. It contains elements of a squeeze and a throw-in. 
It is a kind of immaterial squeeze, in which a discard does not cost a
trick directly, but gives up a position, allowing the opponents to adopt a
winning line.
==Example==
The first example is a one-suit squeeze in which the victim can choose
between an endplay or a simple promotion:
 If the five of diamonds is played, East must choose whether to discard the spade three or an intermediate honor.
By throwing the three East chooses an endplay; South simply ducks a small
spade to East, who has to lead up to the king.
By throwing an intermediate honor, East allows for a promotion of the eight;
South leads the nine, West has to cover in order to avoid an endplay and the
eight will eventually become master.
Note that if the spade five and three were exchanged the squeeze still works.
East can choose between an endplay to the king, or an endplay to the eight.

<doc id="105353" wikidata="Q436177" url="?curid=105353" title="Old Salt Route">
<text>The Old Salt Route was a medieval trade route in Northern Germany, one of the ancient network of salt roads which were used primarily for the transport of salt and other staples. In Germany it was referred to as &quot;Alte Salzstraße&quot;.

Salt was very valuable and essential at that time; it was sometimes referred to as &quot;white gold.&quot; The vast majority of the salt transported on the road was produced from brine near Lüneburg, a city in the northern central part of the country and then transported to Lübeck, a major seaport on Germany&#x27;s Baltic Sea coast.

==History==

Historians generally recognize the Old Salt Route as part of a much longer path, which functioned as an important connection between the northern and southern reaches of the country. One of the oldest documents that confirms Lüneburg and its role in refining and transporting salt dates from 956 A.D. According to that document, King Otto I the Great granted the St. Michaelis Monastery in Lüneburg the customs revenue from the saltworks. Even at those early times, the city&#x27;s wealth was based in large part on the salt found in the area. The Old Salt Route attained its peak of success between the 12th and the 16th century.

The trade route led from Lüneburg northward to Lübeck. From that port city, most of the salt was shipped to numerous destinations that also lie on the Baltic Sea, including Falsterbo, which boasted a Scania Market. There it was used for the preservation of herring, an immensely important food in the Middle Ages, as well as for other foods. The salt trade was a major reason for the power of Lübeck and the Hanseatic League.

==Transport of salt==

Horse-drawn carts brought the salt from Lüneburg to a crossing of the Elbe river at Artlenburg (near Lauenburg) and from there, via Mölln, to Lübeck. For the most part, however, the historic trade route was composed of unsurfaced, sandy and often muddy roads through heathland, woods and small villages, making the transport of salt an arduous task. In addition, the route was somewhat dangerous, since the valuable cargo attracted thieves, bandits and marauders. The dangers faced by those who make the long trek and the fact that only relatively small quantities of the precious crystalline substance could be carried in any single journey, made moving salt via overland routes very expensive.

In 1398, though, the Stecknitz Canal, one of the first manmade waterways in Europe, was completed, making it possible to transport much more salt in a single shipment and to do so with much greater ease and safety. That change helped merchants satisfy the salt requirements of an ever-growing demand. In the 16th century, for example, about 19,000 tons of the product were carried from Lüneburg to Lübeck each year either by land or water. However, it still took about twenty days to complete each trip.

==Tourism==

In modern times, a trip along the Salt Road promises a rich blend of nature and culture. The trip can be made on foot or on bicycle and part of the distance can also be enjoyed on a paddle-wheeled steamer. There are many fascinating sights along the old trade route. These points of interest include the historical towns Lüneburg, Mölln and Lübeck, which are highlighted by beautiful façades and little alleyways, and are a major attraction to visitors.

===Bicycle route===

As a bicycle route, there are the options of a main and a scenic route. The shorter main route (95 km) leads bicyclists through many picturesque little towns such as Lauenburg, Büchen, Mölln and Krummsee and also passes by the Lüne Monastery. The scenic route is especially attractive for nature lovers. The path diverges from the main thoroughfare at Witzeeze, continues on through the Lauenburg Nature Park and rejoins the main route just before Lübeck.

===Lüneburg Heath===

Once, the area around Lüneburg was covered in lush woodlands. But because the medieval salt works depended on wood as a fuel used in boiling and purifying the saline water from which the salt was obtained, much of the forest was cut down. Heather then covered area, helping it to become a landscape that now attracts thousands of visitors when that foliage is in full bloom.

<text>In contract bridge, the criss-cross squeeze is a variant of the simple squeeze in which both menaces are blocked. However, the blocking cards provide the necessary communication between hands after the squeeze has been effected. Unblocking in the correct order allows the squeezing player to cash the newly created winner; but this requires an exact count of the handor a correct guess.

==Examples==
 The menaces are the major-suit queens, blocked by the corresponding aces. One of those aces will serve as entry or re-entry to whichever queen is established by the squeeze. When South cashes the A as squeeze card, West must blank (unguard) one of his kings. The declarer can then cash the ace of the suit in which West has bared his king, and cross to the other ace, which serves as entry to the now-established queen.

 A criss-cross squeeze is technically an automatic squeeze, i.e. it works against either opponentalthough a guess as to which opponent (if either) has been squeezed may be required in the end position after playing the squeeze card (here, A). If the complete hand is as shown here, then East is squeezed; but if declarer cannot be certain from the previous bidding and play who holds both kings, he will have to guess which suit to play first if the defenders discard in different suits (as they should).

If the kings are in different hands, there is no squeeze: both defenders will have idle cards to discard in the suit in which they do not hold a king.

<text>Biomechanics is the study of the structure, function and motion of the mechanical aspects of biological systems, at any level from whole organisms to organs, cells and cell organelles, using the methods of mechanics. Biomechanics is a branch of biophysics. 

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;biomechanics&quot; (1899) and the related &quot;biomechanical&quot; (1856) come from the Ancient Greek βίος &quot;bios&quot; &quot;life&quot; and μηχανική, &quot;mēchanikē&quot; &quot;mechanics&quot;, to refer to the study of the mechanical principles of living organisms, particularly their movement and structure.

== Subfields ==
=== Biofluid mechanics ===
Biological fluid mechanics, or biofluid mechanics, is the study of both gas and liquid fluid flows in or around biological organisms. An often studied liquid biofluid problem is that of blood flow in the human cardiovascular system. Under certain mathematical circumstances, blood flow can be modeled by the Navier–Stokes equations. &quot;In vivo&quot; whole blood is assumed to be an incompressible Newtonian fluid. However, this assumption fails when considering forward flow within arterioles. At the microscopic scale, the effects of individual red blood cells become significant, and whole blood can no longer be modeled as a continuum. When the diameter of the blood vessel is just slightly larger than the diameter of the red blood cell the Fahraeus–Lindquist effect occurs and there is a decrease in wall shear stress. However, as the diameter of the blood vessel decreases further, the red blood cells have to squeeze through the vessel and often can only pass in a single file. In this case, the inverse Fahraeus–Lindquist effect occurs and the wall shear stress increases.

An example of a gaseous biofluids problem is that of human respiration. Respiratory systems in insects have been studied for bioinspiration for designing improved microfluidic devices.

=== Biotribology ===
Biotribology is the study of friction, wear and lubrication of biological systems, especially human joints such as hips and knees. In general, these processes are studied in the context of contact mechanics and tribology.

Additional aspects of biotribology include analysis of subsurface damage resulting from two surfaces coming in contact during motion, i.e. rubbing against each other, such as in the evaluation of tissue-engineered cartilage.

=== Comparative biomechanics ===
Comparative biomechanics is the application of biomechanics to non-human organisms, whether used to gain greater insights into humans (as in physical anthropology) or into the functions, ecology and adaptations of the organisms themselves. Common areas of investigation are animal locomotion and feeding, as these have strong connections to the organism&#x27;s fitness and impose high mechanical demands. Animal locomotion has many manifestations, including running, jumping and flying. Locomotion requires energy to overcome friction, drag, inertia, and gravity, though which factor predominates varies with environment.

Comparative biomechanics overlaps strongly with many other fields, including ecology, neurobiology, developmental biology, ethology, and paleontology, to the extent of commonly publishing papers in the journals of these other fields. Comparative biomechanics is often applied in medicine (with regards to common model organisms such as mice and rats) as well as in biomimetics, which looks to nature for solutions to engineering problems.

=== Computational biomechanics ===
Computational biomechanics is the application of engineering computational tools, such as the finite element method to study the mechanics of biological systems. Computational models and simulations are used to predict the relationship between parameters that are otherwise challenging to test experimentally, or used to design more relevant experiments reducing the time and costs of experiments. Mechanical modeling using finite element analysis has been used to interpret the experimental observation of plant cell growth to understand how they differentiate, for instance. In medicine, over the past decade, the finite element method has become an established alternative to in vivo surgical assessment. One of the main advantages of computational biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endo-anatomical response of an anatomy, without being subject to ethical restrictions. This has led finite element modeling (or other discretization techniques) to the point of becoming ubiquitous in several fields of biomechanics while several projects have even adopted an open source philosophy (e.g., BioSpine). 

Computational biomechanics is an essential ingredient in surgical simulation, which is used for surgical planning, assistance, and training. In this case, numerical (discretization) methods are used to compute, as fast as possible, a system&#x27;s response to boundary conditions such as forces, heat and mass transfer, and electrical and magnetic stimuli.

=== Continuum biomechanics ===
The mechanical analysis of biomaterials and biofluids is usually carried forth with the concepts of continuum mechanics. This assumption breaks down when the length scales of interest approach the order of the microstructural details of the material. One of the most remarkable characteristics of biomaterials is their hierarchical structure. In other words, the mechanical characteristics of these materials rely on physical phenomena occurring in multiple levels, from the molecular all the way up to the tissue and organ levels.

Biomaterials are classified into two groups: hard and soft tissues. Mechanical deformation of hard tissues (like wood, shell and bone) may be analysed with the theory of linear elasticity. On the other hand, soft tissues (like skin, tendon, muscle, and cartilage) usually undergo large deformations, and thus, their analysis relies on the finite strain theory and computer simulations. The interest in continuum biomechanics is spurred by the need for realism in the development of medical simulation.

=== Neuromechanics ===
Neuromechanics uses a biomechanical approach to better understand how the brain and nervous system interact to control the body. During motor tasks, motor units activate a set of muscles to perform a specific movement, which can be modified via motor adaptation and learning. In recent years, neuromechanical experiments have been enabled by combining motion capture tools with neural recordings. 

=== Plant biomechanics ===
The application of biomechanical principles to plants, plant organs and cells has developed into the subfield of plant biomechanics. Application of biomechanics for plants ranges from studying the resilience of crops to environmental stress to development and morphogenesis at cell and tissue scale, overlapping with mechanobiology.

=== Sports biomechanics ===
In sports biomechanics, the laws of mechanics are applied to human movement in order to gain a greater understanding of athletic performance and to reduce sport injuries as well. It focuses on the application of the scientific principles of mechanical physics to understand movements of action of human bodies and sports implements such as cricket bat, hockey stick and javelin etc. Elements of mechanical engineering (e.g., strain gauges), electrical engineering (e.g., digital filtering), computer science (e.g., numerical methods), gait analysis (e.g., force platforms), and clinical neurophysiology (e.g., surface EMG) are common methods used in sports biomechanics.

Biomechanics in sports can be stated as the body&#x27;s muscular, joint, and skeletal actions while executing a given task, skill, or technique. Understanding biomechanics relating to sports skills has the greatest implications on sports performance, rehabilitation and injury prevention, and sports mastery. As noted by Doctor Michael Yessis, one could say that best athlete is the one that executes his or her skill the best.

=== Vascular biomechanics ===

The main topics of the vascular biomechanics is the description of the mechanical behaviour of vascular tissues. 

It is well known that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Vascular system in the human body is the main component that is supposed to maintain pressure and allow for blood flow and chemical exchanges. Studying the mechanical properties of these complex tissues improves the possibility of better understanding cardiovascular diseases and drastically improves personalized medicine. 

Vascular tissues are inhomogeneous with a strongly non linear behaviour. Generally this study involves complex geometry with intricate load conditions and material properties. The correct description of these mechanisms is based on the study of physiology and biological interaction. Therefore, is necessary to study wall mechanics and hemodynamics with their interaction.

It is also necessary to premise that the vascular wall is a dynamic structure in continuous evolution. This evolution directly follows the chemical and mechanical environment in which the tissues are immersed like Wall Shear Stress or biochemical signaling. 

=== Immunomechanics ===
The emerging field of immunomechanics focuses on characterising mechanical properties of the immune cells and their functional relevance. Mechanics of immune cells can be characterised using various force spectroscopy approaches such as acoustic force spectroscopy and optical tweezers, and these measurements can be performed at physiological conditions (e.g. temperature). Furthermore, one can study the link between immune cell mechanics and immunometabolism and immune signalling. The term &quot;immunomechanics&quot; is some times interchangeably used with immune cell mechanobiology or cell mechanoimmunology.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===

Aristotle, a student of Plato, can be considered the first bio-mechanic because of his work with animal anatomy. Aristotle wrote the first book on the motion of animals, &quot;De Motu Animalium&quot;, or On the Movement of Animals. He saw animal&#x27;s bodies as mechanical systems, pursued questions such as the physiological difference between imagining performing an action and actual performance. In another work, &quot;On the Parts of Animals&quot;, he provided an accurate description of how the ureter uses peristalsis to carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.

With the rise of the Roman Empire, technology became more popular than philosophy and the next bio-mechanic arose. Galen (129 AD-210 AD), physician to Marcus Aurelius, wrote his famous work, On the Function of the Parts (about the human body). This would be the world&#x27;s standard medical book for the next 1,400 years.

=== Renaissance ===
The next major biomechanic would not be around until the 1490s, with the studies of human anatomy and biomechanics by Leonardo da Vinci. He had a great understanding of science and mechanics and studied anatomy in a mechanics context. He analyzed muscle forces and movements and studied joint functions. These studies could be considered studies in the realm of biomechanics. Leonardo da Vinci studied anatomy in the context of mechanics. He analyzed muscle forces as acting along lines connecting origins and insertions, and studied joint function. Da Vinci is also known for mimicking some animal features in his machines. For example, he studied the flight of birds to find means by which humans could fly; and because horses were the principal source of mechanical power in that time, he studied their muscular systems to design machines that would better benefit from the forces applied by this animal.

In 1543, Galen&#x27;s work, On the Function of the Parts was challenged by Andreas Vesalius at the age of 29. Vesalius published his own work called, On the Structure of the Human Body. In this work, Vesalius corrected many errors made by Galen, which would not be globally accepted for many centuries. With the death of Copernicus came a new desire to understand and learn about the world around people and how it works. On his deathbed, he published his work, On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres. This work not only revolutionized science and physics, but also the development of mechanics and later bio-mechanics.

Galileo Galilei, the father of mechanics and part time biomechanic was born 21 years after the death of Copernicus. Over his years of science, Galileo made a lot of biomechanical aspects known. For example, he discovered that  &quot;animals&#x27; masses increase disproportionately to their size, and their bones must consequently also disproportionately increase in girth, adapting to loadbearing rather than mere size. The bending strength of a tubular structure such as a bone is increased relative to its weight by making it hollow and increasing its diameter. Marine animals can be larger than terrestrial animals because the water&#x27;s buoyancy relieves their tissues of weight.&quot;

Galileo Galilei was interested in the strength of bones and suggested that bones are hollow because this affords maximum strength with minimum weight. He noted that animals&#x27; bone masses increased disproportionately to their size. Consequently, bones must also increase disproportionately in girth rather than mere size. This is because the bending strength of a tubular structure (such as a bone) is much more efficient relative to its weight. Mason suggests that this insight was one of the first grasps of the principles of biological optimization.

In the 17th century, Descartes suggested a philosophic system whereby all living systems, including the human body (but not the soul), are simply machines ruled by the same mechanical laws, an idea that did much to promote and sustain biomechanical study.

=== Industrial era ===
The next major bio-mechanic, Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, embraced Descartes&#x27; mechanical philosophy and studied walking, running, jumping, the flight of birds, the swimming of fish, and even the piston action of the heart within a mechanical framework. He could determine the position of the human center of gravity, calculate and measure inspired and expired air volumes, and he showed that inspiration is muscle-driven and expiration is due to tissue elasticity.

Borelli was the first to understand that &quot;the levers of the musculature system magnify motion rather than force, so that muscles must produce much larger forces than those resisting the motion&quot;. Influenced by the work of Galileo, whom he personally knew, he had an intuitive understanding of static equilibrium in various joints of the human body well before Newton published the laws of motion. His work is often considered the most important in the history of bio-mechanics because he made so many new discoveries that opened the way for the future generations to continue his work and studies.

It was many years after Borelli before the field of bio-mechanics made any major leaps. After that time, more and more scientists took to learning about the human body and its functions. There are not many notable scientists from the 19th or 20th century in bio-mechanics because the field is far too vast now to attribute one thing to one person. However, the field is continuing to grow every year and continues to make advances in discovering more about the human body. Because the field became so popular, many institutions and labs have opened over the last century and people continue doing research. With the Creation of the American Society of Bio-mechanics in 1977, the field continues to grow and make many new discoveries.

In the 19th century Étienne-Jules Marey used cinematography to scientifically investigate locomotion. He opened the field of modern &#x27;motion analysis&#x27; by being the first to correlate ground reaction forces with movement. In Germany, the brothers Ernst Heinrich Weber and Wilhelm Eduard Weber hypothesized a great deal about human gait, but it was Christian Wilhelm Braune who significantly advanced the science using recent advances in engineering mechanics. During the same period, the engineering mechanics of materials began to flourish in France and Germany under the demands of the Industrial Revolution. This led to the rebirth of bone biomechanics when the railroad engineer Karl Culmann and the anatomist Hermann von Meyer compared the stress patterns in a human femur with those in a similarly shaped crane. Inspired by this finding Julius Wolff proposed the famous Wolff&#x27;s law of bone remodeling.

== Applications ==
The study of biomechanics ranges from the inner workings of a cell to the movement and development of limbs, to the mechanical properties of soft tissue, and bones. Some simple examples of biomechanics research include the investigation of the forces that act on limbs, the aerodynamics of bird and insect flight, the hydrodynamics of swimming in fish, and locomotion in general across all forms of life, from individual cells to whole organisms. With growing understanding of the physiological behavior of living tissues, researchers are able to advance the field of tissue engineering, as well as develop improved treatments for a wide array of pathologies including cancer.

Biomechanics is also applied to studying human musculoskeletal systems. Such research utilizes force platforms to study human ground reaction forces and infrared videography to capture the trajectories of markers attached to the human body to study human 3D motion. Research also applies electromyography to study muscle activation, investigating muscle responses to external forces and perturbations.

Biomechanics is widely used in orthopedic industry to design orthopedic implants for human joints, dental parts, external fixations and other medical purposes. Biotribology is a very important part of it. It is a study of the performance and function of biomaterials used for orthopedic implants. It plays a vital role to improve the design and produce successful biomaterials for medical and clinical purposes. One such example is in tissue engineered cartilage. The dynamic loading of joints considered as impact is discussed in detail by Emanuel Willert.
It is also tied to the field of engineering, because it often uses traditional engineering sciences to analyze biological systems. Some simple applications of Newtonian mechanics and/or materials sciences can supply correct approximations to the mechanics of many biological systems. Applied mechanics, most notably mechanical engineering disciplines such as continuum mechanics, mechanism analysis, structural analysis, kinematics and dynamics play prominent roles in the study of biomechanics.

Usually biological systems are much more complex than man-built systems. Numerical methods are hence applied in almost every biomechanical study. Research is done in an iterative process of hypothesis and verification, including several steps of modeling, computer simulation and experimental measurements.

<text>&quot;Judgment Night&quot; is the tenth episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. In this episode, a passenger aboard a British cargo liner has no memory of how he came aboard, and is tormented by unexpected clues to his true identity and a sense that the ship is headed toward impending doom.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Carl Lanser is a passenger aboard the SS &quot;Queen of Glasgow&quot;, an isolated British cargo liner crossing the Atlantic in 1942, but has no idea of how he got aboard or who he is. Sitting with the captain and several passengers, Lanser dismisses fears of the ship being hunted by a U-boat &quot;wolfpack&quot;, saying only one U-boat would be necessary and it would not bother using a torpedo on the ship. He is unable to explain how he knows any of this and recalls only that he was born in Frankfurt, but says that he finds the ship, its crew and passengers oddly familiar. When called to the bridge by the captain he cannot provide proof of his identity. Still confused, Lanser is sent back to his cabin with a steward, where he finds a &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; officer&#x27;s cap among his possessions with his name written on the inside.

The captain is forced to stop the ship for repairs when the overworked engines break down at 12:05. Lanser becomes increasingly restless, haunted by an inescapable sense of impending doom. Convinced that everyone aboard the ship will die at 1:15, Lanser panics and runs through the passageways, attempting to raise an alarm. He finds the ship is mysteriously empty. When he finally locates some of the passengers, they silently stare at him as he implores them to abandon ship. At exactly 1:15, a searchlight illuminates the ship, and a surfaced U-boat, commanded by Kapitänleutnant Carl Lanser, opens fire with its deck cannon and machine guns. The ship quickly sinks, leaving no survivors.

Some time later, Captain Lanser is in his cabin aboard his U-boat, recording that night&#x27;s kill. His second-in-command, Lt. Mueller, is deeply troubled by what the crew of the boat has done, not warning the people on board the ship before firing upon them, and wonders &quot;if we are not damned now&quot;. Lanser dismissively says he is sure the British Admiralty thinks so, but Mueller clarifies that he meant damned in the eyes of God. Despite Lanser&#x27;s skepticism and sarcasm, Mueller grows more convinced that the crew of the U-boat may one day answer for their crime by reliving the act for all eternity.

Granted his own private hell as the man who ordered the massacre, the former U-boat commander re-materializes on the deck of the ship and the nightmare begins again.

==Closing narration==
==Production==
In the first 18 episodes, Serling only had one minor conflict with CBS regarding episode content. In an interview with Mike Wallace on September 22, 1959, Serling said, &quot;We changed, in eighteen scripts, Mike, we have had one line changed, which, again, was a little ludicrous but of insufficient basic concern within the context of the story, not to put up a fight. On a bridge of a British ship, a sailor calls down to the galley and asks in my script for a pot of tea, because I believe that it&#x27;s constitutionally acceptable in the British Navy to drink tea. One of my sponsors happens to sell instant coffee (Sanka), and he took great umbrage, or at least minor umbrage anyway, with the idea of saying tea. Well, we had a couple of swings back and forth, nothing serious, and we decided we&#x27;d ask for a tray to be sent up to the bridge. But in eighteen scripts, that&#x27;s the only conflict we&#x27;ve had.&quot;

==Short story adaptation==
The episode was adapted into a short story (by Walter B. Gibson) in the 1963 collection &quot;Rod Serling&#x27;s Twilight Zone&quot;. The short story reveals how Lanser died, showing that his U-boat was sunk by a British destroyer after a crewman on the &quot;Queen of Glasgow&quot; radioed for assistance. It also adds a final scene, set 20 years after the episode, in which Barbara Stanley (revealed to have survived the sinking of the &quot;Queen of Glasgow&quot; by boarding a lifeboat) sees the ghosts of Carl Lanser and Lt. Mueller. Mueller does not share in Lanser&#x27;s punishment but is doomed to witness it over and over for eternity.

<text>&quot;And When the Sky Was Opened&quot; is the eleventh episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on December 11, 1959. It is an adaptation of the 1953 Richard Matheson short story &quot;Disappearing Act.&quot;

==Opening narration==
The narration continues after Forbes&#x27; introduction.

==Plot==
USAF Lieutenant Colonel Clegg Forbes arrives at a military hospital to visit his friend and co-pilot Major William Gart. The two had recently piloted an experimental spaceplane, the X-20. During their voyage the craft disappeared from radar screens for a full day before reappearing and crash landing in the desert, leaving Gart with a broken leg. Forbes is agitated and asks Gart if he remembers how many people were on the mission. Gart confirms that only he and Forbes piloted the plane, but Forbes insists that a third man – Colonel Ed Harrington, his best friend for 15 years – accompanied them.

In a flashback, Harrington and Forbes are discharged from the hospital after passing their physical exams and visit a bar downtown. While there, Harrington is suddenly overcome by a feeling that he no longer &quot;belongs&quot; in the world. Disturbed, he phones his parents, who tell him they have no son named Ed and believe the person calling them is a prankster. Harrington then mysteriously vanishes from the phone booth and no one but Forbes remembers his existence. Increasingly desperate, Forbes fruitlessly searches for any trace of his friend.

Back in the present, Forbes finishes recounting the story to Gart and is dismayed by his friend&#x27;s claim that he doesn&#x27;t know anyone named Harrington. Forbes then glances at a mirror and discovers he casts no reflection, causing him to flee the room in terror. Gart tries to hobble after him only to find that Forbes has disappeared. Calling the duty nurse to ask if she saw where Forbes went, Gart is stunned by the nurse&#x27;s claim that nobody named Forbes has been in the building and that Gart was the only man who was in the hospital room. Horrified, Gart also disappears.

An officer enters the building and asks the duty nurse if there are any unused rooms available to accommodate new patients. The nurse takes him to the now completely empty room which hosted the three astronauts, telling him that it has been unoccupied. The hangar which previously housed the X-20 is then shown, with the sheet that covered the craft lying on the ground. There is no trace of the plane, as if it and its crew never existed.

==Closing narration==
==Episode notes==
This episode is loosely based on the short story &quot;Disappearing Act&quot; by Richard Matheson. The story was first published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (March 1953).

Rod Taylor and director Douglas Heyes later worked together on the TV series &quot;Bearcats!&quot;

<text>&quot;What You Need&quot; is the twelfth episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, airing on Christmas Day, 1959. It is based on the short story of the same name by Lewis Padgett (Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore), which was published in the October 1945 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
A peddler named Pedott carries a case of items from which he can give people what they need before they need it. Entering a bar, he gives a woman a vial of cleaning fluid and an impoverished ex-baseball player a bus ticket to Scranton, Pennsylvania. Moments later, the latter receives a phone call over the payphone inviting him to accept a coaching position for a team in Scranton. When he notices a spot on his jacket that he wishes to remove before heading there, the woman with the cleaning fluid helps him scrub it off and the pair become attracted to each other.

Spying what happened, a frustrated, arrogant, and unsuccessful man named Fred Renard asks Pedott to give him what he needs and receives a pair of scissors. Renard soon uses them to cut himself free after his scarf gets caught in a set of elevator doors. When he again demands something he needs from Pedott, he receives a leaky fountain pen, which predicts a winning racehorse after its last drop of ink falls on a newspaper racing column.

Unable to use the pen to predict any further winners, Renard angrily confronts Pedott, who reveals that he only provides items that people need to use once and that he cannot supply things such as serenity and peace of mind. Renard demands Pedott provide him another thing he needs, causing the latter to nervously glance at his case. Assuming the glance has indicated what he needs, Renard seizes a pair of shoes from the case and puts them on, only to find that they are too tight and have slippery soles. When Pedott says that they are actually what he needs, Renard advances on him, but slips on wet pavement and is struck and killed by a passing car. Pedott then reveals he had foreseen his own death and allowed Renard to steal the shoes to prevent it. As he leaves, he gives a comb to a man, who uses it to neaten his hair before he and his wife are photographed for a news story on the accident.

==Closing narration==
==Production information==
The original story featured a machine that could foretell an individual&#x27;s probable future. In the story, the man owns a shop where he has such a machine and then gives people what they need to provide the best possible outcomes; also, the Renard character is killed not by a car but by falling off a subway platform while a train is coming into the station. This version of the story aired on a 1952 episode of the anthology series &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot;, changing the death of the Renard character from a fall to being hit by a car. For his version, Serling replaced the science-fiction element with a street peddler who could magically perform the same function.

The final shot before the first commercial (while Serling is concluding his narration) is actually played backwards; looking carefully, one can see smoke returning to Renard&#x27;s cigarette.

During the scene in Mr. Renard&#x27;s hotel room, a bellhop brings him a newspaper. Renard then opens it and spreads it out on the floor. The movement is quick, but the front page of the newspaper is visible, indicating that it is the same front page used in another &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode, &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot;. The headline reads &quot;H-Bomb Capable of Total Destruction&quot;. Once Renard opens the paper and looks at the racing page, several in-jokes or Easter eggs are apparent in the names of the listed jockeys, which include &quot;Serling&quot;, &quot;Clemens&quot; (referencing director of photography George Clemens), &quot;Houghton&quot; (referencing producer Buck Houghton), &quot;Butler&quot; (referencing set decorator Rudy Butler), and &quot;Denault&quot; (referencing assistant director Edward Denault).

<text>&quot;The Four of Us Are Dying&quot; is the thirteenth episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on CBS on January 1, 1960. It is the first The Twilight Zone to be televised in the 1960s. The episode was based on the original short story by George Clayton Johnson, &quot;All of Us Are Dying&quot;, which had not been published at the time. The story subsequently appeared in the October 1961 issue of &quot;Rogue&quot;.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Arch Hammer is a con man who can change his face to look like anyone he chooses. He walks into a nightclub, where he impersonates deceased trumpeter Johnny Foster to steal Foster&#x27;s grieving girlfriend Maggie, a sultry songstress.

Next, while impersonating murdered gangster Virgil Sterig, Hammer pays a visit to Mr. Pennell, to extort money; Pennell is the man who had Sterig killed. Pennell sends his men after Hammer.

Trying to escape down an alley, Hammer sees a poster of boxer Andy Marshak, and changes his face to the fighter&#x27;s. Pennell&#x27;s men are fooled. Thinking he is in the clear, he runs into Marshak&#x27;s father at a street newsstand, who mistakes him for the son who broke his mother&#x27;s heart and &quot;did dirt to a sweet decent little girl who would&#x27;ve cut off an arm for&quot; him. As Mr. Marshak reels off the reasons why he hates Andy and his punk behavior, Hammer pushes the old man out of the way and returns to his hotel room. A detective comes by to pick him up for questioning; together, they leave for the police station. As they enter the hotel&#x27;s revolving door, Hammer again assumes the boxer&#x27;s appearance. The detective rushes back into the building to find Hammer.

Marshak&#x27;s father is standing on the street, with a gun on Hammer. The con man tries to demonstrate that he is not who the old man thinks he is, but before he can concentrate and change his face, Mr. Marshak shoots him. As Hammer lies dying, his face shifts from one person to another until he dies wearing his own face.

==Closing narration==
==Style==

This episode is notable for its heightened, theatrical lighting, blocking and set design. While most episodes are presented in a very theatrical manner (with limited locations, heightened dialogue and theatrical blocking) not many episodes present themselves as if the action took place on a stage. This theatricality is especially present in its use of harsh shadows and in the neon-signage that hangs above the set to represent Manhattan. One very clear example of this would be when Arch Hammer exits the jazz bar where a bold lighting change indicates that he has put Maggie and the events at the club out of his mind and now seeks his next target. The cinematography is also unusually elaborate and quite cinematic. Extreme, low, wide canted angles drift languidly folly Arch through the streets, symbolising how sleazy and careless his world is. POV shots zipping down from one elevator button to another. A birds-eye view watches him scramble out of an elevator. The camera swirls in smooth reverence around Maggie as she sings her lament. The jazz score is incessant and adds a distinct, coherent rhythm to the episode.

==Production==
&quot;After the first half-dozen stories had been written, part of the hustle was getting an agent. Through those years I found several who would let me use their names, though few cared to sign a contract with me. One of these men, Jay Richards - at the time head of the television department of the Famous Artists Agency, long since absorbed by I.F.A. (International Famous Agency), and since embedded in I.C.M. (International Creative Management), which represents me now in television and movies - agreed to read something. I showed Jay &#x27;All of Us Are Dying.&#x27; After reading it, he crossed out the title with a ballpoint pen and wrote in &#x27;Rubberface!&#x27; Then he sent it to Rod Serling, who had a new series that season called &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.&quot; — George Clayton Johnson, writing in the August 1981 issue of &quot;The Twilight Zone Magazine&quot;

In 2005, &quot;The Four of Us Are Dying&quot; was produced for the stage by 4 Letter Entertainment.

<doc id="105365" wikidata="Q3296789" url="?curid=105365" title="Third from the Sun">
<text>&quot;Third from the Sun&quot; is the fourteenth episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It is based on a short story of the same name by Richard Matheson which first appeared in the first issue of the magazine &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in October 1950.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Will Sturka, a scientist who works at a military base, has been producing a great number of H-bombs alongside other staff members who are manufacturing various devastating weapons in preparation for imminent nuclear war. Sturka realizes that there is only one way to escape—steal an experimental, top-secret spacecraft stored at another base up north. He plans to bring his friend Jerry Riden, who is trained as a pilot of the spacecraft, along with their wives and Sturka&#x27;s daughter Jody. The two plot for months, secretly supplying the ship and making arrangements for their departure. One afternoon, Sturka engages in conversation with a co-worker, Carling, who gleefully tells him that he&#x27;s heard a rumor the war will start in 48 hours. When Sturka voices his disgust at the potential holocaust, Carling is dismayed and cautions him, saying Sturka should watch what he says, and what he thinks.

At home, Sturka confides in his family, trying to assuage his guilt over helping to create weapons by rationalizing he&#x27;s only one part in a much larger machine though he recognizes that he still maintains partial responsibility. His daughter comments that there&#x27;s a terrible feeling in the air, that something dreadful is coming and that everyone can feel it. Sturka realizes that time is running out.

Sturka and Riden decide to put their plan in action—take their families to the site where the spacecraft is held, getting in with help from their contact working at the site whom Riden has bribed and take off in the ship, leaving the planet for good. Carling, suspicious of Sturka since their chat, eavesdrops on them at Sturka&#x27;s house and overhears their plan. Later that night, everyone gathers for a game of cards where Riden reveals that while he was test flying the spacecraft, the military had discovered a small planet 11 million miles away with a civilization similar to theirs—the perfect place to escape. During the game, Carling unexpectedly appears at the door and hints that he knows what the group is plotting. He also hints at trouble: &quot;A lot can happen in forty-eight hours.&quot; After Carling leaves, Sturka receives a call from his superiors, commanding him to return to the base. He and Riden inform the women that they must leave that very moment.

When the five arrive at the site of the spacecraft, Sturka and Riden spot their contact, who flashes a light. When the contact steps forward, he is revealed to be Carling, armed with a gun. He forces Sturka and Riden away from the gate and prepares to call the authorities. The women, who have been waiting in the car, watch as Carling orders them out. Jody suddenly throws the car&#x27;s door open, knocking the gun from Carling&#x27;s hand and giving the men enough time to overpower him and knock him out. The group rushes into the ship, fighting off the guards that chase after them.

Later that evening, the group has safely escaped their doomed planet and are on course. Sturka says it&#x27;s hard to believe there are people living on the alien world where they&#x27;re headed. Riden points out on the ship&#x27;s viewer their mysterious destination, 11 million miles away—the third planet from the Sun, called &quot;Earth&quot;.

==Closing narration==
==Reception==
Emily Van Der Werff of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; rated it A and called the twist &quot;justifiably famous&quot;.

<text>Mohenjo Daro is a 2016 Indian Hindi-language period action-adventure film written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. It was produced by Siddharth Roy Kapur for UTV Motion Pictures and The Walt Disney Company India and Sunita Gowariker for Ashutosh Gowariker Productions (AGPPL), and stars Hrithik Roshan and Pooja Hegde. Set in the ancient Indus Valley civilisation city of Mohenjo-daro, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is loosely based on Ali Baba&#x27;s Sindhi novel &quot;Mohan Jo Daro&quot;. This film marked Pooja Hegde&#x27;s debut in Hindi cinema.

Set in 2016 BCE at the height of the Indus Valley Civilisation, the story follows a farmer Sarman (Hrithik Roshan), who travels to the city of Mohenjo-daro and falls in love with a high-status woman (Pooja Hegde), and who must then challenge the city&#x27;s elite, and fight against overwhelming odds to save their civilisation. Gowariker took over three years to research and develop the script, working closely with archaeologists to ensure authenticity in the representation of his fictional story. The film was shot in Bhuj and Mumbai with brief schedules in Bhedaghat (Jabalpur) and Thane.

The score and soundtrack are composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics penned by Javed Akhtar. The film was released worldwide on 12 August 2016. The film received mixed reviews and grossed worldwide, emerging as a box-office bomb.

&quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; marks the last film production of UTV Motion Pictures, as two Disney releases, &quot;Dangal&quot; and &quot;Jagga Jasoos&quot;, became producer Kapur&#x27;s final projects under the Disney·UTV brand before his contract with the company lapsed on 1 January 2017; the non-Hindi versions of both films were nonetheless presented by the banner, while &quot;Jagga Jasoos&quot; faced delays before its release in mid-July 2017.

==Plot==
The film opens in 2016 BCE with Sarman (Hrithik Roshan), a young man from the village of Amri, who lost his parents at a young age. Sarman kills a crocodile that has been terrorizing his village&#x27;s fishermen and is hailed as a hero. He asks his uncle, Durjan (Nitish Bharadwaj), to allow him to go to Mohenjo-daro to trade their family&#x27;s goods, but his uncle refuses. Sarman attempts to sneak away to the city at night with his friend Hojo (Umang Vyas) but is caught by Durjan, who relents and allows both friends to go. He gives Sarman a seal that contains an inscription of a unicorn that Sarman often sees in his dreams, suggesting he uses it only once in a life-or-death situation.

Arriving in Mohenjo-daro, Sarman learns that the city is ruled by the tyrannical Senate Chief Maham (Kabir Bedi) and his wicked son Moonja (Arunoday Singh). He also learns that the unicorn he sees in his dreams is the symbol of the city, and feels the city is oddly familiar to him. While Sarman is trading, Maham proposes to impose an additional tax on the farmers so that the city may grow, but Sarman leads the farmers to oppose the taxes so that their families don&#x27;t starve to death. Sarman gains access to the upper city by showing his uncle&#x27;s amulet and meets Chaani (Pooja Hegde), the daughter of the head priest (Manish Choudhary) of Mohenjo Daro. Sarman is enchanted by Chaani&#x27;s beauty and charm and falls in love with her. Upon meeting, the head priest strangely appears to recognise Sarman. Chaani reveals that she has been forcibly betrothed to Moonja. Maham discovers that Sarman and Chaani love each other and that Sarman is the leader of the tax revolt, so he challenges Sarman to fight Bakar and Zokar, his two champions. Sarman proposes that if he wins, Chaani will be released from her engagement, and Maham accepts the terms.

On the night before Sarman&#x27;s clash with Bakar and Zokar, the head priest reveals to him how Maham was expelled from Harappa for illegal trade with the Sumerians. Maham entered Mohenjo-daro as a trader and quickly rose to become the trade chief. Maham had discovered that the mighty Sindhu River held vast gold deposits, so he decided to place a dam on the river and divert its course to mine the gold. The wise Senate Chief Srujan (Sharad Kelkar), who is revealed to be Sarman&#x27;s father, opposed this, but Maham won the vote to build the dam. He had Srujan framed and arrested for hoarding gold. Chaani&#x27;s father and Durjan – Sarman&#x27;s uncle – were coerced by Maham to betray Srujan, and the latter was killed. Maham then took Srujan&#x27;s place as the new Senate Chief.

In the arena outside the city, Sarman faces the ferocious Tajik mountain cannibals Bakar and Zokhar. After a vicious battle, he kills one of the cannibals but spares the other, and the people of Mohenjo-daro surge even stronger behind him. Enraged, Maham urges Moonja to finish off Chaani and the priest. Moonja kills the priest, but Sarman saves Chaani and kills Moonja.

Sarman exposes Maham&#x27;s plan to use the gold from the Sindhu to enrich himself and to smuggle in weapons from the Sumerians. All the chiefs now stand against Maham. The people elect Sarman as the new chief, but Sarman suggests Mohenjo-daro needs a people&#x27;s government, not a chief. With the arrival of a heavy thunderstorm, Sarman realises that the dam will burst and the Sindhu river will flood the city. He rallies the people to lash boats together and form a floating bridge. They evacuate Mohenjo-daro and cross to the other side of the river. The dam collapses, and Maham, chained in the city square, drowns as the city is destroyed. The survivors migrate to another river, where Sarman sees the unicorn of his dreams and names the river Ganga.

===Development===
Director Ashutosh Gowariker was first inspired to make a film set in the ancient Indus Valley civilszation when he was in Bhuj, Gujarat, scouting locations for his then-upcoming &quot;Lagaan&quot; (2001), and stumbled across the massive excavations in progress at the ruins of Dholavira: &quot;I thought, My God! This is incredible! What happened to this civilisation, who were the people, how did they live?&quot;

Several other film projects later, Gowariker announced the film &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; officially in February 2014 with A. R. Rahman composing the film score.

On taking up the project, in an interview, Gowariker stated that there was meagre and superficial information available about the people in that civilisation, particularly about their lifestyle, food, and feelings. The lack of information about the period troubled Gowariker, and he decided that whenever he would get a story to tell, it will be depicted circa 2500 BC at Mohenjo-daro which, despite being the largest city yet discovered from that ancient civilisation, is today known only by the name—which translates as &quot;Mound of the Dead&quot; in English—ascribed by the Sindhi locals to the site when its ruins were discovered in 1922. &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; is not only the official name associated with that ancient city by the United Nations (as a World Heritage Site since 1980), but also the only name associated with it by archaeologists and historians around the world, as well as the general public. Thus, regardless of the literal translation of the words, &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; was the only possible title for an audience to identify with the actual reference point despite the fact that the city could have not been so named in ancient times.

On the film&#x27;s plot, he was quoted as saying, &quot;While the plot will follow Mohenjo-daro and the culture and the vibe of the ancient civilisation, it will largely centre on a love story.&quot; It took Gowariker three years to piece together a plot of the entire civilisation through various cities and weave a love story into it.

The challenges of adapting for cinema a story based on one of the greatest ancient civilisations of the world whose written language has not yet been deciphered have proved unique. Because modern science can not yet read anything the Indus Valley peoples wrote about themselves, any aspect about their civilisation has to be conjectured from what relics survive to discovery by archaeologists working at their various ruins. As &quot;The Indian Express&quot; pointed out, &quot;whatever we do know about Mohenjo-daro is perhaps as much an imagination of the historian as that of a filmmaker who depicts it in visual terms.&quot;

During Ashutosh Gowariker&#x27;s research, he met as many as seven archaeologists who are closely involved in excavating sites and studying the Indus Valley Civilisation. After much reading of published archaeological reports on his own, he brought in the American archaeologist Jonathan Mark Kenoyer of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, considered one of the world&#x27;s leading experts on the ancient Indus Valley civilisation, who had worked at the ruins of Mohenjo-Daro over 35 years. He brought together Kenoyer to round-table with five other expert archaeologists who have also been working on this topic for many years—P. Ajit Prasad, V. N. Prabakhar, K. Krishnan, Vasant Shinde, and R. S. Bisht, &quot;who are all from the Archaeological Survey of India, Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda and other institutions, all with expertise in different aspects of the same civilisation.&quot; Gowariker had also personally revisited the archaeological dig at Dholavira in Gujarat.

Kenoyer later visited Bhuj to inspect and approve the sets and props built by the filmmakers.

The symbol ultimately selected for the film &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; recalls one of the earliest discovered artifacts from the initial archaeological excavations at the ruins of the ancient city itself: &#x27;Another [seal] shows six animal heads—&quot;unicorn&quot;, bison, antelope, tiger, the remaining two broken—radiating from a ring, and recalling a whorl on another seal from the same site with a single &quot;unicorn&quot; and five featureless lobes&#x27;, the &quot;unicorn&quot; being one of the &#x27;most frequently represented&#x27; animals portrayed among the &#x27;over 1,200 of them [seals] [which] have been found at Mohenjo-daro alone&#x27;. The filmmaker has chosen to identify the &quot;unicorn&quot; with his central character.

The broadest artistic license required in bringing the Indus Valley civilisation to the cinema, inevitably, would be costuming. Because although &quot;undisputed traces of cotton cloth have survived at Mohenjo-Daro&quot; and the Indus culture is believed by archaeologists to have pioneered the cultivation of cotton for clothmaking in the ancient world, no actual samples of finished clothing or other organic matter have survived over these four thousand years, due to the &quot;damp alkalkine soil&quot; prevailing at the Indus sites. Thus, the only reference material is the relative handful (compared with the broad abundance of seals found, or commercial items such as weights and measures) of terracotta humanoid figurines or small stone statues found at various excavations, which are mostly only partially intact and of mostly unknown purpose—but male or female, are mostly naked. Some of the female figures, for instance, wear elaborate headdresses and jewellery but little else. Explained the director in an interview, &quot;I cannot make a movie with so much nudity, obviously. So I had to create and imagine a costume which will be away from all the different styles that we have seen in other movies, and yet be special for this civilisation.&quot;

With the film being set in a certain period, the whole site had to be recreated in a film studio. He was involved in working out the logistics during June 2014. The film&#x27;s stunts were choreographed by Glenn Boswell and the costumes were designed by April Ferry and Neeta Lulla. U.K. based trainer Joshua Kyle Baker was roped in to train Roshan for his character in the film. He described the three-month training so as to allow Roshan to appear &#x27;lithe&#x27; and &#x27;agile&#x27; rather than muscular. Relating the natural environment required for &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot;, Gowariker was impressed with the calamitous VFX seen in the films &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;10,000 BC&quot; that were designed by Karen Goulekas. In September 2014, as a visual effects supervisor, Goulekas was brought on board for the film. Gowariker revisited Bhuj in December 2014 to begin production.

===Casting===

In August 2014, Roshan, who had starred in Gowariker&#x27;s critically and commercially successful &quot;Jodhaa Akbar&quot; in 2008, was confirmed to play the male lead role again for &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot;. He reportedly demanded . Said the director, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have made the film, without Hrithik.&quot; &quot;[T]his is a different world, and I thought only Hrithik would blend in perfectly.&quot;

Telugu and Tamil cinema actress Pooja Hegde was signed as the female lead, and made her Hindi film debut with &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot;. &quot;While scripting the film, I was thinking that I needed someone with innocence and someone who did not have stardom baggage [to be received by the audience only as this character]. I thus began looking for a fresh face when Sunita (Gowariker) spotted Pooja in a commercial and suggested that we call her. She called Pooja and I auditioned her. And that was it!&quot;

Veteran actor Kabir Bedi was signed as the primary villain, backed by Arunoday Singh as the younger villain.

For supporting roles, casting director Nalini Rathnam wanted to bring in newer and fresh faces, even from non-Hindi speaking regions. As the director explained this process, &quot;All kinds of actors, including seasoned actors, never get a chance to come to Mumbai or they don&#x27;t want to as they are happy in their own space. So there is a different kind of freshness there to get them on board. I did this in &quot;Lagaan&quot; and &quot;Jodhaa Akbar&quot;. In this film too, I wanted to get some fresh actors, so I have Diganta Hazarika, who is a well-known Assamese actor. It is a time-consuming process but the payoff big.&quot;

Since action and romance were key to his story, perfectionist Gowariker went to great lengths in casting to ensure his vision reaches the screen. For example, for one specific action sequence, the director auditioned nearly 300 candidates before finally casting the two giant barbarian fighters who are more than 7 feet tall, in order to make the sequence thrilling and visually appealing when presented to the audience opposite his 6-foot-tall hero.

To populate his recreation of the ancient city, Gowariker naturally required a huge number of non-actors as extras. With the full cooperation of the Bhuj panchayat or community council, the filmmakers hosted full-fledged auditions for all the local residents. Many of those seen on-screen in cityscapes and group scenes throughout &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; are the real-life local citizens of Bhuj.

===Pre-production===

Construction of the primary outdoor sets to be used in recreating the ancient city duly commenced in Bhuj, Gujarat, near where Gowariker had shot his earlier film, &quot;Lagaan&quot; (2001).

As AGPPL producer Sunita Gowariker recounted their initial dialogue when Ashutosh decided &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; as his next project, her immediate response was that the city does not exist any more, how would they shoot the film. To which Ashutosh responded: &quot;We put up the whole city!&quot; The film sets ultimately built to recreate the ancient city of Mohenjo-Daro spanned more than 25 acres.

Painstaking effort was made to ensure accuracy of the city&#x27;s film set construction, matching its proportions and architecture to the actual archaeological ruins. The famous Great Bath, for instance, is built to scale, as are the houses in the film. To quote lead actress Pooja Hegde, &quot;The sets were so detailed that once we stepped onto them, you were enveloped by the ambience. Ashu sir&#x27;s detailing is so great that if there&#x27;s a &quot;mashal&quot;, the wall behind it would be blackened to resemble soot. Whenever I stepped onto the sets, I automatically got into the mood ... Ashu sir made you feel like you were already there.&quot;

However, construction was delayed in mid-September 2014, when workers belonging to Allied Mazdoor Union and Film Studio Setting refused to complete the pre-production work, alleging non-payment of their regular expenses and remuneration. In response to this stalled situation, Gowariker took a legal route and lodged a complaint with the Indian Film and Television Producers&#x27; Council accusing the members of stalling work that would result in losses to the company. Lawrence D&#x27;Souza, the executive producer of the film, maintained that though their payments were ready, the remote filming locations of Bhuj delayed the reception of the same.

Ayananka Bose had originally been signed as the cinematographer. When the film was delayed, he took up other projects as he was paid on a project-to-project basis. Bose failed to join the discussions prior to filming and requested Gowariker to be allowed to join the set directly after he was done with his other commitments. A displeased Gowariker replaced Bose with C. K. Muraleedharan.

The initial outdoor schedule of principal photography had been projected to begin in November 2014. However, further delay occurred when lead actor Hrithik Roshan injured his shoulder during training in late October 2014. Because &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; was a physically demanding film with challenging action sequences that were to be shot starting with the very first schedule, and no body doubles were to be used, Gowariker postponed the shoot for six weeks, until January 2015. Confirming this delay, Sunita Gowariker stated, &quot;Ashutosh and I want Hrithik to recuperate fully before beginning the film, since we plan to start with action sequences. Now we will start shooting in the first week of January. It is important to us that Hrithik is 100% fit, and shifting the shooting dates by a few weeks makes a lot of sense.&quot;

===Filming===
Principal photography commenced in Bhuj on 27 January 2015. But the demanding action sequences needed by the film took a hard physical toll on the cast which resulted in delays due to injury, especially when an accident involved the lead actor, Hrithik Roshan, who was required for the maximum number of scenes. For instance, shooting was delayed for several days in March 2015, when Hrithik sprained his neck during a fight sequence. The first schedule of 101 days nonetheless wrapped up in Bhuj by 23 May 2015. In June 2015, Hrithik started training to fight with tigers in one of the sequences of the film. A second, shorter outdoor schedule resumed in Bhuj in late summer and was completed by October 2015.

Another outdoor schedule of filming began in Jabalpur on 2 November 2015, where a fight sequence with crocodiles was completed on the banks of river Narmada at Bhedaghat.

In December 2015, the next schedule began at Film City in Mumbai, where most interior sets used for the film had been constructed. Unfortunately, however, an on-set accident during an action sequence in January 2016 tore two ligaments and severely sprained the ankle of lead actor Hrithik Roshan, which kept him home on crutches and doctor-ordered bed rest for two whole months before primary photography could resume in late March.

On 4 April 2016, the crew filmed the climax of the film at China Creek in Thane. Principal photography of &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; finally wrapped on 8 April 2016.

===Post-production===

Post-production of &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; was supervised by Gowariker in conjunction with editor Sandeep Francis. Sound re-recording was performed at Futureworks by Justin Jose K. according to the sound design by Parikshit Lalwani and Kunal Mehta. Digital intermediate was done by Prime Focus colorist Makarand Surte. Visual effects were completed by the firm Drishyam VFX under the guidance of VFX consultant Karen Goulekas in conjunction with VFX supervisor Govardhan Vigraham.

India&#x27;s Central Board of Film Certification cleared &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; for release without any cuts, awarding it a &quot;U/A&quot; certificate.

=== Accusations of plagiarism ===
On 3 August 2016, the Bombay High Court rejected allegations by Akashaditya Lama that Gowariker had plagiarised his script, and also &quot;... imposed exemplary and punitive costs of Rs. 150,000 against Lama for putting false allegations and harassing makers of the film. The court has also slammed Lama for giving interviews, media articles and related material put on social media to harass the director and other stars of the film.&quot; Gowariker donated the entire fine received (approx. $2,246) to the Naam Foundation, a charity to benefit Maharashtra&#x27;s drought-hit farmers.

== Music ==

The music for the film was composed by A. R. Rahman, marking his fourth collaboration with Gowariker, after &quot;Lagaan&quot;, &quot;Swades&quot;, and &quot;Jodhaa Akbar&quot;. The lyrics were penned by Javed Akhtar. The music rights were acquired by T-Series.

The soundtrack consists of eight tracks, namely, &quot;Mohenjo Mohenjo&quot;, &quot;Sindhu Ma&quot;, &quot;Sarsariya&quot;, &quot;Tu Hai&quot;, &quot;Whispers Of The Mind&quot;, &quot;Whispers Of The Heart&quot;, &quot;The Shimmer Of Sindhu&quot;, and &quot;Lakh Lakh Thora&quot;. The album was released by T-Series on 6 July 2016.

==Release==
&quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; was released across 2600–2700 screens in India. Disney India announced in September 2016, that the company would end production of Bollywood films and instead would shift focus on releasing Disney films produced in the United States. Initially, the film announced to release on 14 January 2016, 19 December 2015 and 10 March 2016.

===Locarno International Film Festival===
Even before the film&#x27;s theatrical release, &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; had been honoured as the Closing Film of the 69th Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland. Thus on 13 August 2016, &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; was screened at the Piazza Grande, immediately before Locarno&#x27;s award ceremony.

===Special screenings===
A special screening of &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; was arranged for the officials of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting of India in New Delhi on 18 September 2016. The film was also screened at the 45th Annual Conference on South Asia in Madison, Wisconsin on 23 October 2016.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; received mixed reviews from critics who praised its cast performances, musical numbers, action sequences, VFX and characterisation, but criticised its historical inaccuracies, script and screenplay. 

Srijana Mitra Das of &quot;The Times of India&quot; gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote &quot;Straight away, if you want to enjoy Mohenjo Daro, leave your disbelief by the door for Ashutosh Gowarikar&#x27;s newest blast from the past only works as a fairy tale, not nailed in history, but hanging somewhere between Game of Thrones and Baahubali.&quot; &quot;Mumbai Mirror&quot; gave the film rating of 3/5 and termed Mohenjo Daro as good. &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; gave the film rating of 2.5/5 and wrote &quot;Mohenjo Daro comes across as a grand historical fictional tale which appeals only in parts.&quot; Rachit Gupta of &quot;Filmfare&quot; gave the film a rating of 2.5/5 and wrote &quot;Full marks to director Ashutosh Gowariker and the Mohenjo Daro team for making a film that’s detailed and a very good insight into the lost Indus Valley Civilisation. The close attention to detail, especially on the production design is the strength of this movie. If you’ve ever wondered what the ancient cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa must’ve looked like, this movie is a must watch.&quot;

==Box office==
&quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; clashed with Akshay Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Rustom&quot;. &quot;Mohenjo Daro&quot; grossed worldwide in its first 10 days. Its final worldwide gross was , including in India and overseas. In addition to its box office gross, the film also earned from satellite rights (450 million) and music rights (150 million).

<text>Adolph Zukor (; ; January 7, 1873 – June 10, 1976) was a Hungarian-American film producer best known as one of the three founders of Paramount Pictures. He produced one of America&#x27;s first feature-length films, &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, in 1913.

==Early life==
Zukor was born to an Ashkenazi Jewish family in Ricse, in the Kingdom of Hungary in January 1873, which was then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father, Jacob, who operated a general store, died when he was a toddler, while his mother, Hannah Liebermann, died when he was 7 years old. Adolph and his brother Arthur moved in with Kalman Liebermann, their uncle. Liebermann, a rabbi, expected his nephews to become rabbis, but instead Adolph served a three-year apprenticeship in the dry goods store of family friends. When he was 16, he decided to emigrate to the United States. He sailed from Hamburg on the s/s Rugia on March 1 and arrived in New York City under the name Adolf Zuckery on March 16, 1891. Like most immigrants, he began modestly. After landing in New York City, he began working in an upholstery shop. A friend then got him a job as an apprentice at a furrier.

Zukor stayed in New York City for two years. When he left to become a &quot;contract&quot; worker, sewing fur pieces and selling them himself, he was 20 years old and an accomplished designer. He was young and adventuresome, and the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago drew him to the Midwest. There he started a fur business. In the second season of operation, Zukor&#x27;s Novelty Fur Company expanded to 25 men and opened a branch.

Historian Neal Gabler wrote, &quot;one of the stubborn fallacies of movie history is that the men who created the film industry were all impoverished young vulgarians...&quot; Zukor clearly didn&#x27;t fit this profile. By 1903, he already looked and lived like a wealthy young burgher, and he certainly earned the income of one. He had a commodious apartment at 111th Street and Seventh Avenue in New York City&#x27;s wealthy German-Jewish section&quot;.

In 1918, he moved to New City, Rockland County, New York, where he purchased 300 acres of land from Lawrence Abraham, heir to the A&amp;S Department Stores. Abraham had already built a sizable house, a nine-hole golf course and a swimming pool on this property. Two years later, Zukor bought an additional 500 acres, built a night house, guest house, movie theater, locker room, greenhouses, garages and staff quarters, and hired golf architect A.W. Tillinghast to build an 18-hole championship golf course. Today, Zukor&#x27;s estate is the private Paramount Country Club.

==Early film career==
In 1903, he became involved in the film industry when his cousin, Max Goldstein, approached him for a loan to invest in a chain of theaters. These theaters were started by Mitchell Mark in Buffalo, New York, and hosted Edisonia Hall. Mark needed investors to expand his chain of theaters. Zukor gave Goldstein the loan and formed a partnership with Mark and Morris Kohn, a friend of Zukor&#x27;s who also invested in the theaters. Zukor, Mark, and Kohn opened a penny arcade operating as The Automatic Vaudeville Company on 14th Street in New York City. They soon opened branches in Boston, Philadelphia, and Newark, with funding by Marcus Loew. By 1910, Zukor already owned a nickelodeon chain and became Leow&#x27;s partner in a theater circuit. Two years later, he sold his shares in Loew&#x27;s company in order to purchase the French film, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;.

==Famous Players==

In 1912, Adolph Zukor established Famous Players Film Company—advertising &quot;Famous Players in Famous Plays&quot;—as the American distribution company for the French film production &quot;Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth&quot; starring Sarah Bernhardt. The following year he obtained the financial backing of the Frohman brothers, the powerful New York City theatre impresarios. Their primary goal was to bring noted stage actors to the screen and Zukor went on to produce &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1913). He purchased an armory on 26th Street in Manhattan and converted it into Chelsea Studios, a movie studio that is still used today.

In 1916, the company merged with Jesse L. Lasky&#x27;s company to form Famous Players–Lasky.

==Paramount Pictures==
The Paramount Pictures Corporation was formed to distribute films made by Famous Players–Lasky and a dozen smaller companies which were pulled into Zukor&#x27;s corporate giant. The consolidations led to the formation of a nationwide film distribution system.

In 1917, Zukor acquired 50% of Lewis J. Selznick&#x27;s Select Pictures which led Selznick&#x27;s publicity to wane. Later, however, Selznick bought out Zukor&#x27;s share of Select Pictures.

Zukor shed most of his early partners; the Frohman brothers, Hodkinson and Goldwyn were out by 1917.

In 1919, the company bought 135 theaters in the Southern states, making the producing concern the first that guaranteed exhibition of its own product in its own theaters. He revolutionized the film industry by organizing production, distribution, and exhibition within a single company.

Zukor believed in employing stars. He signed many of the early ones, including Mary Pickford, Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle, Marguerite Clark, Pauline Frederick, Douglas Fairbanks, Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, and Wallace Reid. With so many important players, Zukor also pioneered &quot;Block Booking&quot; for Paramount Pictures, which meant that an exhibitor who wanted a particular star&#x27;s films had to buy a year&#x27;s worth of other Paramount productions. That system gave Paramount a leading position in the 1920s and 1930s, but led the government to pursue it on antitrust grounds for more than 20 years.

Zukor was the driving force behind Paramount&#x27;s success. Through the teens and twenties, he also built the Publix Theatres Corporation, a chain of nearly 2000 screens. He also ran two production studios, one in Astoria, New York (now the Kaufman Astoria Studios) and the other in Hollywood, California.

In 1926, Zukor hired independent producer B. P. Schulberg, who had an unerring eye for new talent, to run the new West Coast operations. Lasky and Zukor purchased the Robert Brunton Studios, a 26-acre facility at 5451 Marathon Street, for US$1 million. In 1927, Famous Players–Lasky took the name Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation. In 1930, because of the importance of the Publix Theatres, it became the Paramount Publix Corporation.

By then, Zukor was turning out 60 features a year. He made deals to show them all in theaters controlled by Loew&#x27;s Incorporated, and also continued to add more theaters to his own chain. By 1920, he was in a position to charge what he wished for film rentals. Thus he pioneered the concept, now the accepted practice in the film industry, by which the distributor charges the exhibitor a percentage of box-office receipts.

Zukor, ever the impresario, bought a huge plot of ground at Broadway and 43d Street, over objections of his board of directors, to build the Paramount Theater and office building, a 39-story building that had its grand opening in 1926. He managed to keep stars such as Pola Negri, Gloria Swanson, and most important of all, Mary Pickford, under contract and happy to stay at Paramount. At one point, Pickford told Zukor: &quot;You know, for years I&#x27;ve dreamed of making $20,000 a year before I was 20, and I&#x27;ll be 20 very soon.&quot;

&quot;I could take a hint,&quot; Zukor recalled wryly. &quot;She got the $20,000, and before long I was paying her $100,000 a year. Mary was a terrific businessman.&quot;

Zukor was, primarily, also a businessman. &quot;He did not take the same personal, down-to-the-last-detail interest in the making of his movies that producer-executives such as Samuel Goldwyn and Louis B. Mayer did,&quot; wrote &quot;The New York Times&quot; in Zukor&#x27;s obituary at the age of 103. He became an early investor in radio, taking a 50 percent interest in the new Columbia Broadcasting System in 1928, but selling it within a few years.

Partner Lasky hung on until 1932, when Paramount nearly collapsed in the Great Depression years. Lasky was blamed for that and tossed out. In the following year, Paramount went into receivership. Ultimately at fault were Zukor&#x27;s over-expansion and use of overvalued Paramount stock for purchases that made the company file for bankruptcy. A bank-mandated reorganization team kept the company intact, and, miraculously, Zukor was able to return as production chief. On June 4, 1935, John E. Otterson became president. When Barney Balaban was appointed president on July 2, 1936, Zukor was relegated to chairman of the board.

He eventually spent most of his time in New York City, but passed the winter months in Hollywood to check on his studio. He retired from Paramount Pictures in 1959 and in 1964, stepped down as chairman and assumed Chairman Emeritus status, a position he held up until his death at the age of 103 in Los Angeles.

==Personal life and death==
In 1897, he married Lottie Kaufman; they had two children, Eugene J. Zukor, who became a Paramount executive in 1916, and Mildred Zukor Loew who married Arthur Loew, son of Marcus Loew.

Zukor was a Freemason at Centennial Lodge No. 673, New York.

Zukor died from natural causes at his Los Angeles residence at age 103 in June 1976. He is buried at the Temple Israel Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

<doc id="105373" wikidata="Q155626" url="?curid=105373" title="John Singer Sargent">
<text>John Singer Sargent (; January 12, 1856 – April 14, 1925) was an American expatriate artist, considered the &quot;leading portrait painter of his generation&quot; for his evocations of Edwardian-era luxury. He created roughly 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as countless sketches and charcoal drawings. His &quot;oeuvre&quot; documents worldwide travel, from Venice to the Tyrol, Corfu, Capri, Spain, the Middle East, Montana, Maine, and Florida.

Born in Florence to American parents, he was trained in Paris before moving to London, living most of his life in Europe. He enjoyed international acclaim as a portrait painter. An early submission to the Paris Salon in the 1880s, his &quot;Portrait of Madame X&quot;, was intended to consolidate his position as a society painter in Paris but instead resulted in scandal. During the year following the scandal, Sargent departed for England, where he continued a successful career as a portrait artist.

From the beginning, Sargent&#x27;s work is characterized by remarkable technical facility, particularly in his ability to draw with a brush, which in later years inspired admiration as well as criticism for its supposed superficiality. His commissioned works were consistent with the grand manner of portraiture, while his informal studies and landscape paintings displayed a familiarity with Impressionism. In later life, Sargent expressed ambivalence about the restrictions of formal portrait work and devoted much of his energy to mural painting and working &quot;en plein air&quot;. Art historians generally ignored society artists such as Sargent until the late 20th century.

The exhibition in the 1980s of Sargent&#x27;s previously hidden male nudes served to spark a reevaluation of his life and work, and its psychological complexity. In addition to the beauty, sensation and innovation of his oeuvre, his same-sex interests, unconventional friendships with women and engagement with race, gender nonconformity, and emerging globalism are now viewed as socially and aesthetically progressive and radical.

==Early life==
Sargent was a descendant of Epes Sargent, a colonial military leader and jurist. Before John Singer Sargent&#x27;s birth, his father, FitzWilliam (b. 1820 in Gloucester, Massachusetts), was an eye surgeon at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia from 1844 to 1854. After John&#x27;s older sister died at the age of two, his mother, Mary Newbold Sargent (née Singer, 1826–1906), suffered a breakdown, and the couple decided to go abroad to recover. They remained nomadic expatriates for the rest of their lives. Although based in Paris, Sargent&#x27;s parents moved regularly, spending seasons at the sea and at mountain resorts in France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.

While Mary was pregnant, they stopped in Florence, Tuscany, because of a cholera epidemic. Sargent was born there in 1856. A year later, his sister Mary was born. After her birth, FitzWilliam reluctantly resigned his post in Philadelphia and accepted his wife&#x27;s request to remain abroad. They lived modestly on a small inheritance and savings, leading a quiet life with their children. They generally avoided society and other Americans, except for friends in the art world. Four more children were born abroad, of whom only two lived past childhood.

Although his father was a patient teacher of basic subjects, young Sargent was a rambunctious child, more interested in outdoor activities than his studies. As his father wrote home: &quot;He is quite a close observer of animated nature.&quot; His mother was convinced that traveling around Europe, and visiting museums and churches, would give young Sargent a satisfactory education. Several attempts to have him formally schooled failed, owing mostly to their itinerant life. His mother was a capable amateur artist and his father was a skilled medical illustrator. Early on, she gave him sketchbooks and encouraged drawing excursions. Sargent worked on his drawings, and he enthusiastically copied images from &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; of ships and made detailed sketches of landscapes. FitzWilliam had hoped that his son&#x27;s interest in ships and the sea might lead him toward a naval career.

At thirteen, his mother reported that John &quot;sketches quite nicely, &amp; has a remarkably quick and correct eye. If we could afford to give him really good lessons, he would soon be quite a little artist&quot;. At the age of thirteen, he received some watercolor lessons from Carl Welsch, a German landscape painter. Although his education was far from complete, Sargent grew up to be a highly literate and cosmopolitan young man, accomplished in art, music, and literature. He was fluent in English, French, Italian, and German. At seventeen, Sargent was described as &quot;willful, curious, determined and strong&quot; (after his mother) yet shy, generous, and modest (after his father). He was well-acquainted with many of the great masters from first-hand observation, as he wrote in 1874: &quot;I have learned in Venice to admire Tintoretto immensely and to consider him perhaps second only to Michelangelo and Titian.&quot;

== Training ==
An attempt to study at the Academy of Florence failed, as the school was reorganizing at the time. After returning to Paris from Florence, Sargent began his art studies with the young French portraitist Carolus-Duran. Following a meteoric rise, the artist was noted for his bold technique and modern teaching methods; his influence would be pivotal to Sargent during the period from 1874 to 1878.

In 1874, Sargent passed on his first attempt the rigorous exam required to gain admission to the , the premier art school in France. He took drawing classes, which included anatomy and perspective, and gained a silver prize. He also spent much time in self-study, drawing in museums and painting in a studio he shared with James Carroll Beckwith. He became both a valuable friend and Sargent&#x27;s primary connection with the American artists abroad. Sargent also took some lessons from Léon Bonnat.
Carolus-Duran&#x27;s atelier was progressive, dispensing with the traditional academic approach, which required careful drawing and underpainting, in favor of the method of working directly on the canvas with a loaded brush, derived from Diego Velázquez. It was an approach that relied on the proper placement of tones of paint. Sargent would later create a painting in this style that prompted comments such as: &quot;The student has surpassed the teacher.&quot;

This approach also permitted spontaneous flourishes of color not bound to an underdrawing. It was markedly different from the traditional atelier of Jean-Léon Gérôme, where Americans Thomas Eakins and Julian Alden Weir had studied. Sargent was the star student in short order. Weir met Sargent in 1874 and noted that Sargent was &quot;one of the most talented fellows I have ever come across; his drawings are like the old masters, and his color is equally fine&quot;. Sargent&#x27;s excellent command of French and his superior talent made him both popular and admired. Through his friendship with Paul César Helleu, Sargent would meet giants of the art world, including Degas, Rodin, Monet, and Whistler.
Sargent&#x27;s early enthusiasm was for landscapes, not portraiture, as evidenced by his voluminous sketches full of mountains, seascapes, and buildings. Carolus-Duran&#x27;s expertise in portraiture finally influenced Sargent in that direction. Commissions for history paintings were still considered more prestigious, but were much harder to get. Portrait painting, on the other hand, was the best way of promoting an art career, getting exhibited in the Salon, and gaining commissions to earn a livelihood.

Sargent&#x27;s first major portrait was of his friend Fanny Watts in 1877, and was also his first Salon admission. Its particularly well-executed pose drew attention. His second salon entry was the &quot;Oyster Gatherers of Cançale&quot;, an impressionistic painting of which he made two copies, one of which he sent back to the United States, and both received warm reviews.

==Early career==
In 1879 at the age of 23, Sargent painted a portrait of his teacher Carolus-Duran; the virtuoso effort met with public approval and announced the direction his mature work would take. Its showing at the Paris Salon was both a tribute to his teacher and an advertisement for portrait commissions. Of Sargent&#x27;s early work, Henry James wrote that the artist offered &quot;the slightly &#x27;uncanny&#x27; spectacle of a talent which on the very threshold of its career has nothing more to learn&quot;.

After leaving Carolus-Duran&#x27;s atelier, Sargent visited Spain. There he studied the paintings of Velázquez with a passion, absorbing the master&#x27;s technique, and in his travels gathered ideas for future works. He was entranced with Spanish music and dance. The trip also re-awakened his own talent for music (which was nearly equal to his artistic talent), and which found visual expression in his early masterpiece &quot;El Jaleo&quot; (1882). Music would continue to play a major part in his social life as well, as he was a skillful accompanist of both amateur and professional musicians. Sargent became a strong advocate for modern composers, especially Gabriel Fauré.
Trips to Italy provided sketches and ideas for several Venetian street-scene genre paintings, which effectively captured gestures and postures he would find useful in later portraiture.

Upon his return to Paris, Sargent quickly received several portrait commissions. His career was launched. He immediately demonstrated the concentration and stamina that enabled him to paint with workman-like steadiness for the next twenty-five years. He filled in the gaps between commissions with many non-commissioned portraits of friends and colleagues. His fine manners, perfect French, and great skill made him a standout among the newer portraitists, and his fame quickly spread. He confidently set high prices and turned down unsatisfactory sitters. He mentored his friend Emil Fuchs, who was learning to paint portraits in oils.

==Works==
===Portraits===
====Nineteenth-century portraits====

In the early 1880s, Sargent regularly exhibited portraits at the Salon, and these were mostly full-length portrayals of women, such as &quot;Madame Edouard Pailleron&quot; (1880) (done &quot;en plein-air&quot;) and &quot;Madame Ramón Subercaseaux&quot; (1881). He continued to receive positive critical notice.

Sargent&#x27;s best portraits reveal the individuality and personality of the sitters; his most ardent admirers think he is matched in this only by Velázquez, who was one of Sargent&#x27;s great influences. The Spanish master&#x27;s spell is apparent in Sargent&#x27;s &quot;The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit&quot;, 1882, a haunting interior that echoes Velázquez&#x27;s &quot;Las Meninas&quot;. As in many of his early portraits, Sargent confidently tries different approaches with each new challenge, here employing both unusual composition and lighting to striking effect. One of his most widely exhibited and best loved works of the 1880s was &quot;Lady with the Rose&quot; (1882), a portrait of Charlotte Burckhardt, a close friend and possible romantic attachment.

===== Portrait of Madame X =====

His most controversial work, &quot;Portrait of Madame X&quot; (Madame Pierre Gautreau) (1884) is now considered one of his best works and was his favorite; he stated in 1915: &quot;I suppose it is the best thing I have done.&quot; When unveiled in Paris at the 1884 Salon, it aroused such a negative reaction that it likely prompted Sargent&#x27;s move to London. Sargent&#x27;s self-confidence had led him to attempt a risqué experiment in portraiture—but this time it unexpectedly backfired.

The painting was not commissioned by her, and he pursued her for the opportunity, quite unlike most of his portrait work where clients sought him out. Sargent wrote to a common acquaintance:

It took well over a year to complete the painting. The first version of the portrait of Madame Gautreau, with the famously plunging neckline, white-powdered skin, and arrogantly cocked head, featured an intentionally suggestive off-the-shoulder dress strap, on her right side only, which made the overall effect more daring and sensual. Sargent repainted the strap to its expected over-the-shoulder position to try to dampen the furor, but the damage had been done. French commissions dried up and he told his friend Edmund Gosse in 1885 that he contemplated giving up painting for music or business.

Writing of the reaction of visitors, Judith Gautier observed:

Prior to the Madame X scandal of 1884, Sargent had painted exotic beauties such as Rosina Ferrara of Capri and the Spanish expatriate model Carmela Bertagna, but the earlier pictures had not been intended for broad public reception. Sargent kept the painting prominently displayed in his London studio until he sold it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1916 after moving to the United States, and a few months after Gautreau&#x27;s death.

===== Move to England =====
Before arriving in England, Sargent began sending paintings for exhibition at the Royal Academy. These included the portraits of &quot;Dr. Pozzi at Home&quot; (1881), a flamboyant essay in red and his first full-length male portrait, and the more traditional &quot;Mrs. Henry White&quot; (1883). The ensuing portrait commissions encouraged Sargent to complete his move to London in 1886, where he settled in the artistic community of Chelsea.

Notwithstanding the Madame X scandal, he had considered moving to London as early as 1882; he had been urged to do so repeatedly by his new friend, the novelist Henry James. In retrospect his transfer to London may be seen to have been inevitable.

English critics were not warm at first, faulting Sargent for his &quot;clever&quot; &quot;Frenchified&quot; handling of paint. One reviewer seeing his portrait of &quot;Mrs. Henry White&quot; described his technique as &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;almost metallic&quot; with &quot;no taste in expression, air, or modeling&quot;. With help from Mrs. White, however, Sargent soon gained the admiration of English patrons and critics. Henry James also gave the artist &quot;a push to the best of my ability&quot;.

Sargent spent much time painting outdoors in the English countryside when not in his studio. On a visit to Monet at Giverny in 1885, Sargent painted one of his most Impressionistic portraits, of Monet at work painting outdoors with his new bride nearby. Sargent is usually not thought of as an Impressionist painter, but he sometimes used impressionistic techniques to great effect. His &quot;Claude Monet Painting at the Edge of a Wood&quot; is rendered in his own version of the Impressionist style. In the 1880s, he attended the Impressionist exhibitions and he began to paint outdoors in the &quot;plein-air&quot; manner after that visit to Monet. Sargent purchased four Monet works for his personal collection during that time.

Sargent was similarly inspired to do a portrait of his artist friend Paul César Helleu, also painting outdoors with his wife by his side. A photograph very similar to the painting suggests that Sargent occasionally used photography as an aid to composition. Through Helleu, Sargent met and painted the famed French sculptor Auguste Rodin in 1884, a rather somber portrait reminiscent of works by Thomas Eakins. Although the British critics classified Sargent in the Impressionist camp, the French Impressionists thought otherwise. As Monet later stated: &quot;He is not an Impressionist in the sense that we use the word, he is too much under the influence of Carolus-Duran.&quot;

Sargent&#x27;s first major success at the Royal Academy of Arts came in 1887, with the enthusiastic response to &quot;Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose&quot;, a large piece, painted on site, of two young girls lighting lanterns in an English garden in Broadway in the Cotswolds. The painting was immediately purchased by the Tate Gallery.

His first trip to New York and Boston as a professional artist in 1887–88 produced over 20 important commissions, including portraits of Isabella Stewart Gardner, the famed Boston art patron. His portrait of Mrs. Adrian Iselin, wife of a New York businessman, revealed her character in one of his most insightful works. In Boston, Sargent was honored with his first solo exhibition, which presented 22 of his paintings. Here he became friends with painter Dennis Miller Bunker, who traveled to England in the summer of 1888 to paint with him en plein air, and is the subject of Sargent&#x27;s 1888 painting &quot;Dennis Miller Bunker Painting at Calcot&quot;.

Back in London, Sargent was quickly busy again. His working methods were by then well-established, following many of the steps employed by other master portrait painters before him. After securing a commission through negotiations which he carried out, Sargent would visit the client&#x27;s home to see where the painting was to hang. He would often review a client&#x27;s wardrobe to pick suitable attire. Some portraits were done in the client&#x27;s home, but more often in his studio, which was well-stocked with furniture and background materials he chose for proper effect. He usually required eight to ten sittings from his clients, although he would try to capture the face in one sitting. He usually kept up pleasant conversation and sometimes he would take a break and play the piano for his sitter. Sargent seldom used pencil or oil sketches, and instead laid down oil paint directly. Finally, he would select an appropriate frame.

Sargent had no assistants; he handled all the tasks, such as preparing his canvases, varnishing the painting, arranging for photography, shipping, and documentation. He commanded about $5,000 per portrait, or about $130,000 in current dollars. Some American clients traveled to London at their own expense to have Sargent paint their portrait.
The range of pigments regularly used by Sargent was: &quot;Mars yellow (a synthetic iron oxide) and cadmium yellow; viridian and emerald green, sometimes mixed; vermillion and Mars red, both alone and mixed; madder; synthetic ultramarine or cobalt blue; and ivory black, sienna and Mars brown&quot;.

Around 1890, Sargent painted two daring non-commissioned portraits as show pieces—one of actress Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth and one of the popular Spanish dancer &quot;La Carmencita&quot;. Sargent was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, and was made a full member three years later.

In the 1890s, he averaged fourteen portrait commissions per year, none more beautiful than the genteel &quot;Lady Agnew of Lochnaw&quot;, 1892. His portrait of Mrs. Hugh Hammersley (&quot;Mrs. Hugh Hammersley&quot;, 1892) was equally well received for its lively depiction of one of London&#x27;s most notable hostesses. As a portrait painter in the grand manner, Sargent had unmatched success; he portrayed subjects who were at once ennobled and often possessed of nervous energy. Sargent was referred to as &quot;the Van Dyck of our times&quot;.

Although Sargent was an American expatriate, he returned to the United States many times, often to answer the demand for commissioned portraits. Sargent exhibited nine of his portraits in the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

Sargent painted a series of three portraits of Robert Louis Stevenson. The second, &quot;Portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson and his Wife&quot; (1885), was one of his best known. He also completed portraits of two U.S. presidents: Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. In 1896, the Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art commissioned Sargent to produce a portrait of Henry Gurdon Marquand. Marquand served as the second president of the museum, and was instrumental in its founding. In 1888, Sargent released his portrait of Alice Vanderbilt Shepard, great-granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt. Many of his most important works are in museums in the United States. In 1897, a friend sponsored a famous portrait in oil of Mr. and Mrs. I. N. Phelps Stokes, by Sargent, as a wedding gift. Jean Zimmerman documents the creation of the Stokes portrait in her dual biography of the couple, &quot;Love, Fiercely&quot;.

In 1898, Asher Wertheimer, a wealthy Jewish art dealer living in London, commissioned from Sargent a series of a dozen portraits of his family, the artist&#x27;s largest commission from a single patron. The Wertheimer portraits reveal a pleasant familiarity between the artist and his subjects. Even though Wertheimer bequeathed most of the paintings to the National Gallery, nowadays they are on display at the Tate Britain.

====Twentieth-century portraits====

By 1900, Sargent was at the height of his fame. Cartoonist Max Beerbohm completed one of his seventeen caricatures of Sargent, making well known to the public the artist&#x27;s paunchy physique. Although only in his forties, Sargent began to travel more and to devote relatively less time to portrait painting. His &quot;An Interior in Venice&quot; (1900), a portrait of four members of the Curtis family in their elegant palatial home, &quot;Palazzo Barbaro&quot;, was a resounding success. But, Whistler did not approve of the looseness of Sargent&#x27;s brushwork, which he summed up as &quot;smudge everywhere&quot;. One of Sargent&#x27;s last major portraits in his bravura style was that of Lord Ribblesdale, in 1902, finely attired in an elegant hunting uniform. Between 1900 and 1907, Sargent continued his high productivity, which included, in addition to dozens of oil portraits, hundreds of portrait drawings at about $400 each. In 1901, he purchased the next door property to his home in Tite Street, to create a larger studio.

In 1907, at the age of fifty-one, Sargent officially closed his studio. Relieved, he stated: &quot;Painting a portrait would be quite amusing if one were not forced to talk while working... What a nuisance having to entertain the sitter and to look happy when one feels wretched.&quot; In that same year, Sargent painted his modest and serious self-portrait, his last, for the celebrated self-portrait collection of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.

Sargent made several summer visits to the Swiss Alps with his sisters Emily Sargent, an accomplished painter in her own right, and Violet Sargent (Mrs Ormond) and also Violet&#x27;s daughters Rose-Marie and Reine, who were the subject of a number of paintings between 1906 and 1913 like &quot;The Black Brook&quot; (1908) or &quot;Nonchaloir (Repose)&quot; (1911).
By the time Sargent finished his portrait of John D. Rockefeller in 1917, most critics began to consign him to the masters of the past, &quot;a brilliant ambassador between his patrons and posterity&quot;. Modernists treated him more harshly, considering him completely out of touch with the reality of American life and with emerging artistic trends including Cubism and Futurism. Sargent quietly accepted the criticism, but refused to alter his negative opinions of modern art. He retorted: &quot;Ingres, Raphael and El Greco, these are now my admirations, these are what I like.&quot;

Sometime between 1917 and 1920, Sargent painted the portrait of Thomas McKeller, a young African-American elevator operator and WWI veteran. The canvas was kept in the painter&#x27;s studio until his death and only began to be displayed permanently to the public in 1986 when it was acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. McKeller also posed as a model for the mythological murals that Sargent painted at the stairway and the rotunda of the MFA Boston and for the World War I memorial murals at Harvard&#x27;s Widener Library.

In 1925, shortly before he died, Sargent painted his last oil portrait, a canvas of aristocrat Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston. The painting was purchased in 1936 by the Currier Museum of Art, in Manchester, New Hampshire, where it has been on display since then.

===Watercolors===
During Sargent&#x27;s long career, he painted more than 2,000 watercolors, roving from the English countryside to Venice to the Tyrol, Corfu, the Middle East, Montana, Maine, and Florida. Each destination offered pictorial stimulation and treasure. Even at his leisure, in escaping the pressures of the portrait studio, he painted with restless intensity, often painting from morning until night.

His hundreds of watercolors of Venice are especially notable, many done from the perspective of a gondola. His colors were sometimes extremely vivid and as one reviewer noted: &quot;Everything is given with the intensity of a dream.&quot; In the Middle East and North Africa Sargent painted Bedouins, goatherds, and fishermen. In the last decade of his life, he produced many watercolors in Maine, Florida, and in the American West, of fauna, flora, and native peoples.

With his watercolors, Sargent was able to indulge his earliest artistic inclinations for nature, architecture, exotic peoples, and noble mountain landscapes. And it is in some of his late works where one senses Sargent painting most purely for himself. His watercolors were executed with a joyful fluidness. He also painted extensively family, friends, gardens, and fountains. In watercolors, he playfully portrayed his friends and family dressed in Orientalist costume, relaxing in brightly lit landscapes that allowed for a more vivid palette and experimental handling than did his commissions (&quot;The Chess Game&quot;, 1906). His first major solo exhibit of watercolor works was at the Carfax Gallery in London in 1905. In 1909, he exhibited eighty-six watercolors in New York City, eighty-three of which were bought by the Brooklyn Museum. Evan Charteris wrote in 1927:

Although not generally accorded the critical respect given Winslow Homer, perhaps America&#x27;s greatest watercolorist, scholarship has revealed that Sargent was fluent in the entire range of opaque and transparent watercolor technique, including the methods used by Homer.

===Other work===

As a concession to the insatiable demand of wealthy patrons for portraits, Sargent dashed off hundreds of rapid charcoal portrait sketches, which he called &quot;Mugs&quot;. Forty-six of these, spanning the years 1890–1916, were exhibited at the Royal Society of Portrait Painters in 1916.

All of Sargent&#x27;s murals are to be found in the Boston/Cambridge area in Massachusetts. They are in the Boston Public Library, the Museum of Fine Arts, and Harvard&#x27;s Widener Library. Sargent&#x27;s largest scale works are the mural decorations &quot;Triumph of Religion&quot; that grace the Boston Public Library, depicting the history of religion and the gods of polytheism. They were attached to the walls of the library by means of marouflage. He worked on the cycle for almost thirty years but never completed the final mural. Sargent drew on his extensive travels and museum visits to create a dense art historical mélange. The murals were most recently restored in 2003–2004 by a team from the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies, Harvard Art Museums.

Sargent worked on the murals from 1895 through 1919; they were intended to show religion&#x27;s (and society&#x27;s) progress from pagan superstition up through the ascension of Christianity, concluding with a painting depicting Jesus delivering the Sermon on the Mount. But Sargent&#x27;s paintings of &quot;The Church&quot; and &quot;The Synagogue&quot;, installed in late 1919, inspired a debate about whether the artist had represented Judaism in a stereotypical, or even an anti-Semitic, manner. Drawing upon iconography that was used in medieval paintings, Sargent portrayed Judaism and the synagogue as a blind, ugly hag, and Christianity and the church as a lovely, radiant young woman. He also failed to understand how these representations might be problematic for the Jews of Boston; he was both surprised and hurt when the paintings were criticized. The paintings were objectionable to Boston Jews since they seemed to show Judaism defeated, and Christianity triumphant. The Boston newspapers also followed the controversy, noting that while many found the paintings offensive, not everyone agreed. In the end, Sargent abandoned his plan to finish the murals, and the controversy eventually died down.

Upon his return to England in 1918 after a visit to the United States, Sargent was commissioned as a war artist by the British Ministry of Information. In his large painting &quot;Gassed&quot; and in many watercolors, he depicted scenes from the Great War. Sargent had been affected by the death of his niece Rose-Marie in the shelling of the St Gervais church, Paris, on Good Friday 1918.

==Relationships and personal life==
Sargent was a life-long bachelor with a wide circle of friends, including Oscar Wilde (with whom he was neighbors for several years), gay author Violet Paget and his likely lover Albert de Belleroche. Biographers once portrayed him as staid and reticent. However, recent scholarship has theorised he was a private, complex and passionate man whose homosexual identity was integral to shaping his art. This view is based on statements by his friends and associates, the general alluring remoteness of his portraits, the way his works challenge 19th-century notions of gender difference, his previously ignored male nudes, and some male portraits, including those of Thomas McKeller, Bartholomy Maganosco, Olimpio Fusco, and that of aristocratic artist Albert de Belleroche, which hung in his Chelsea dining room. Sargent had a long friendship with Belleroche, whom he met in 1882 and traveled with frequently. A surviving drawing suggests Sargent might have used him as a model for &quot;Madame X&quot;, following a coincidence of dates for Sargent drawing each of them separately around the same time, and the delicate pose suggestive more of Sargent&#x27;s sketches of the male form than his often stiff commissions.

It has been suggested that Sargent&#x27;s reputation in the 1890s as &quot;the painter of the Jews&quot; may have been due to his empathy with and complicit enjoyment of their mutual social foreignness. One such Jewish client, Betty Wertheimer, wrote that when in Venice, Sargent &quot;was only interested in the Venetian gondoliers&quot;. The painter Jacques-Émile Blanche, who was one of his early sitters, said after Sargent&#x27;s death that his sex life &quot;was notorious in Paris, and in Venice, positively scandalous. He was a frenzied bugger.&quot;

He had many relationships with women. It has been suggested that those with his sitters Rosina Ferrara, Virginie Gautreau, and Judith Gautier may have tipped into infatuation. As a young man, Sargent also for a time courted Louise Burkhardt, the model for &quot;Lady with the Rose&quot;.

Sargent&#x27;s friends and supporters included Henry James and Isabella Stewart Gardner, of both of whom he painted portraits, and Gardner also commissioned and purchased works from Sargent and sought his advice on other acquisitions. Edward VII and Paul César Helleu were also friends and supporters of Sargent. His associations also included Prince Edmond de Polignac and Count Robert de Montesquiou. Other artists Sargent associated with were Dennis Miller Bunker, James Carroll Beckwith, Edwin Austin Abbey, and John Elliott (who also worked on the Boston Public Library murals), Francis David Millet, Joaquín Sorolla, and Claude Monet, whom Sargent portrayed with Monet&#x27;s wife &quot;by the edge of a wood&quot;. Between 1905 and 1914, Sargent&#x27;s frequent traveling companions were the married artist couple Wilfrid de Glehn and Jane Emmet de Glehn. The trio would often spend summers in France, Spain, or Italy, and all three would depict one another in their paintings during their travels.

==Critical assessment==
In a time when the art world focused, in turn, on Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism, Sargent practiced his own form of Realism, which made brilliant references to Velázquez, Van Dyck, and Gainsborough. His seemingly effortless facility for paraphrasing the masters in a contemporary fashion led to a stream of commissioned portraits of remarkable virtuosity (&quot;Arsène Vigeant&quot;, 1885, Musées de Metz; &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Newton Phelps-Stokes&quot;, 1897, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and earned Sargent the moniker, &quot;the Van Dyck of our times&quot;. In 1916, he was awarded an honorary degree by Harvard University.

Still, during his life his work engendered negative responses from some of his colleagues: Camille Pissarro wrote &quot;he is not an enthusiast but rather an adroit performer&quot;, and Walter Sickert published a satirical turn under the heading &quot;Sargentolatry&quot;. By the time of his death he was dismissed as an anachronism, a relic of the Gilded Age and out of step with the artistic sentiments of post-World War I Europe. Elizabeth Prettejohn suggests that the decline of Sargent&#x27;s reputation was due partly to the rise of anti-Semitism, and the resultant intolerance of &#x27;celebrations of Jewish prosperity.&#x27; It has been suggested that the exotic qualities inherent in his work appealed to the sympathies of the Jewish clients whom he painted from the 1890s on.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in his portrait &quot;Almina, Daughter of Asher Wertheimer&quot; (1908), in which the subject is seen wearing a Persian costume, a pearl encrusted turban, and strumming an Indian tambura, accoutrements all meant to convey sensuality and mystery. If Sargent used this portrait to explore issues of sexuality and identity, it seems to have met with the satisfaction of the subject&#x27;s father, Asher Wertheimer, a wealthy Jewish art dealer.

Foremost of Sargent&#x27;s detractors was the influential English art critic Roger Fry, of the Bloomsbury Group, who at the 1926 Sargent retrospective in London dismissed Sargent&#x27;s work as lacking aesthetic quality: &quot;Wonderful indeed, but most wonderful that this wonderful performance should ever have been confused with that of an artist.&quot; And, in the 1930s, Lewis Mumford led a chorus of the severest critics: &quot;Sargent remained to the end an illustrator ... the most adroit appearance of workmanship, the most dashing eye for effect, cannot conceal the essential emptiness of Sargent&#x27;s mind, or the contemptuous and cynical superficiality of a certain part of his execution.&quot;

Part of Sargent&#x27;s devaluation is also attributed to his expatriate life, which made him seem less American at a time when &quot;authentic&quot; socially conscious American art, as exemplified by the Stieglitz circle and by the Ashcan School, was on the ascent.

After such a long period of critical disfavor, Sargent&#x27;s reputation has increased steadily since the 1950s. In the 1960s, a revival of Victorian art and new scholarship directed at Sargent strengthened his reputation. Sargent has been the subject of large-scale exhibitions in major museums, including a retrospective exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1986 and a major 1999 traveling show that exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the National Gallery of Art Washington, and the National Gallery, London. In 2022, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, and in 2023 the Legion of Honor in San Francisco, California, hosted an exhibition of Sargent&#x27;s paintings from Spain.

In 1986, Andy Warhol commented to Sargent scholar Trevor Fairbrother that Sargent &quot;made everybody look glamorous. Taller. Thinner. But they all have mood, every one of them has a different mood.&quot; In a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article from the 1980s, critic Robert Hughes praised Sargent as &quot;the unrivaled recorder of male power and female beauty in a day that, like ours, paid excessive court to both&quot;.

==Later life==
In 1922, Sargent co-founded New York City&#x27;s Grand Central Art Galleries together with Edmund Greacen, Walter Leighton Clark, and others. Sargent actively participated in the Grand Central Art Galleries and their academy, the Grand Central School of Art, until his death in 1925. The Galleries held a major retrospective exhibit of Sargent&#x27;s work in 1924. He then returned to England, where he died at his Chelsea home on April 14, 1925, of heart disease. Sargent is interred in Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey.

Memorial exhibitions of Sargent&#x27;s work were held in Boston in 1925, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and at the Royal Academy and Tate Gallery in London in 1926. The Grand Central Art Galleries also organized a posthumous exhibition in 1928 of previously unseen sketches and drawings from throughout his career.

==Sales==

&quot;Portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson and his Wife&quot; was sold in 2004 for US$8.8 million and is located at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art at Bentonville, Arkansas.

In December 2004, &quot;Group with Parasols (A Siesta)&quot; (1905) sold for US$23.5 million, nearly double the Sotheby&#x27;s estimate of $12 million. The previous highest price for a Sargent painting was US$11 million.

==In popular culture==
In 2018, Comedy Central star Jade Esteban Estrada wrote, directed, and starred in &quot;Madame X: A Burlesque Fantasy&quot;, a stage production (premiered in San Antonio, Texas) based on the life of Sargent and his famous painting, &quot;Portrait of Madame X&quot;.

The works of Sargent feature prominently in Maggie Stiefvater&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;Mister Impossible&quot;.

In 2024, Exhibition on Screen produced a documentary &quot;John Singer Sargent: Fashion &amp; Swagger&quot;, filmed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Tate Britain, London. It was based on the Sargent and fashion exhibits at those two museums in 2023 and 2024.

On July 13, 2024, the Des Moines Metro Opera premiered Damien Geter and Lila Palmer&#x27;s &quot;American Apollo,&quot; an opera about John Singer Sargent&#x27;s supposed affair with Thomas McKeller (1890–1962), one of his favorite models.

Where formula_22 is the inverse standardized Student  CDF, and formula_23 is the standardized Student t PDF.

In probability theory and statistics, Student&#x27;s  distribution (or simply the distribution) formula_24 is
a continuous probability distribution that generalizes the standard normal distribution. Like the latter, it is symmetric around zero and bell-shaped.

However, formula_24 has heavier tails and the amount of probability mass in the tails is controlled by the parameter formula_26 For formula_27 the Student&#x27;s distribution formula_28 becomes the standard Cauchy distribution, which has very &quot;fat&quot; tails; whereas for formula_29 it becomes the standard normal distribution formula_30 which has very &quot;thin&quot; tails.

The Student&#x27;s  distribution plays a role in a number of widely used statistical analyses, including Student&#x27;s  test for assessing the statistical significance of the difference between two sample means, the construction of confidence intervals for the difference between two population means, and in linear regression analysis.

In the form of the &quot;location-scale  distribution&quot; formula_31 it generalizes the normal distribution and also arises in the Bayesian analysis of data from a normal family as a compound distribution when marginalizing over the variance parameter.

== Definitions ==

===Probability density function===
Student&#x27;s  distribution has the probability density function (PDF) given by

:formula_32

where formula_33 is the number of &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; and formula_34 is the gamma function. This may also be written as

:formula_35

where formula_36is the beta function. In particular for integer valued degrees of freedom formula_33 we have:

For formula_38 and even,

: formula_39

For formula_38 and odd,

: formula_41

The probability density function is symmetric, and its overall shape resembles the bell shape of a normally distributed variable with mean 0 and variance 1, except that it is a bit lower and wider. As the number of degrees of freedom grows, the  distribution approaches the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. For this reason formula_42 is also known as the normality parameter.

The following images show the density of the  distribution for increasing values of formula_43 The normal distribution is shown as a blue line for comparison. Note that the  distribution (red line) becomes closer to the normal distribution as formula_33 increases.

===Cumulative distribution function===
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) can be written in terms of , the regularized
incomplete beta function. For 

:formula_45

where

:formula_46

Other values would be obtained by symmetry. An alternative formula, valid for formula_47 is

:formula_48

where formula_49 is a particular instance of the hypergeometric function.

For information on its inverse cumulative distribution function, see .

Certain values of formula_33 give a simple form for Student&#x27;s t-distribution.


==Properties==
===Moments===
For formula_51 the raw moments of the  distribution are

:formula_52

Moments of order formula_33 or higher do not exist.

The term for formula_54 even, may be simplified using the properties of the gamma function to

:formula_55

For a  distribution with formula_33 degrees of freedom, the expected value is formula_3 if formula_4 and its variance is formula_59 if formula_60 The skewness is 0 if formula_61 and the excess kurtosis is formula_62 if formula_63
===How the  distribution arises (characterization) ===

====As the distribution of a test statistic====
Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution with formula_64 degrees of freedom can be defined as the distribution of the random variable &quot;T&quot; with

:formula_65

where
* &quot;Z&quot; is a standard normal with expected value 0 and variance 1;
* &quot;V&quot; has a chi-squared distribution () with formula_64 degrees of freedom;
* &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are independent;

A different distribution is defined as that of the random variable defined, for a given constant &quot;μ&quot;, by
:formula_67
This random variable has a noncentral &quot;t&quot;-distribution with noncentrality parameter &quot;μ&quot;. This distribution is important in studies of the power of Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test.

=====Derivation=====
Suppose &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; are independent realizations of the normally-distributed, random variable &quot;X&quot;, which has an expected value &quot;μ&quot; and variance &quot;σ&quot;2. Let

:formula_68

be the sample mean, and

:formula_69

be an unbiased estimate of the variance from the sample. It can be shown that the random variable

: formula_70

has a chi-squared distribution with formula_71 degrees of freedom (by Cochran&#x27;s theorem). It is readily shown that the quantity

:formula_72

is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1, since the sample mean formula_73 is normally distributed with mean &quot;μ&quot; and variance &quot;σ&quot;2/&quot;n&quot;. Moreover, it is possible to show that these two random variables (the normally distributed one &quot;Z&quot; and the chi-squared-distributed one &quot;V&quot;) are independent. Consequently the pivotal quantity

:formula_74

which differs from &quot;Z&quot; in that the exact standard deviation &quot;σ&quot; is replaced by the sample standard error &quot;s&quot;, has a Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution as defined above. Notice that the unknown population variance &quot;σ&quot;2 does not appear in &quot;T&quot;, since it was in both the numerator and the denominator, so it canceled. Gosset intuitively obtained the probability density function stated above, with formula_64 equal to &quot;n&quot; − 1, and Fisher proved it in 1925.

The distribution of the test statistic &quot;T&quot; depends on formula_64, but not &quot;μ&quot; or &quot;σ&quot;; the lack of dependence on &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;σ&quot; is what makes the &quot;t&quot;-distribution important in both theory and practice.

====Sampling distribution of t-statistic====
The  distribution arises as the sampling distribution
of the  statistic. Below the one-sample  statistic is discussed, for the corresponding two-sample  statistic see Student&#x27;s t-test.

=====Unbiased variance estimate=====
Let formula_77 be independent and identically distributed samples from a normal distribution with mean formula_78 and variance formula_79 The sample mean and unbiased sample variance are given by:

: formula_80

The resulting (one sample)  statistic is given by

: formula_81

and is distributed according to a Student&#x27;s  distribution with formula_82 degrees of freedom.

Thus for inference purposes the  statistic is a useful &quot;pivotal quantity&quot; in the case when the mean and variance formula_83 are unknown population parameters, in the sense that the  statistic has then a probability distribution that depends on neither formula_78 nor formula_79

=====ML variance estimate=====
Instead of the unbiased estimate formula_86 we may also use the maximum likelihood estimate
:formula_87
yielding the statistic
: formula_88
This is distributed according to the location-scale  distribution:
: formula_89

====Compound distribution of normal with inverse gamma distribution====
The location-scale  distribution results from compounding a Gaussian distribution (normal distribution) with mean formula_90 and unknown variance, with an inverse gamma distribution placed over the variance with parameters formula_91 and formula_92 In other words, the random variable &quot;X&quot; is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution with an unknown variance distributed as inverse gamma, and then the variance is marginalized out (integrated out).

Equivalently, this distribution results from compounding a Gaussian distribution with a scaled-inverse-chi-squared distribution with parameters formula_64 and formula_94 The scaled-inverse-chi-squared distribution is exactly the same distribution as the inverse gamma distribution, but with a different parameterization, i.e. formula_95

The reason for the usefulness of this characterization is that in Bayesian statistics the inverse gamma distribution is the conjugate prior distribution of the variance of a Gaussian distribution. As a result, the location-scale  distribution arises naturally in many Bayesian inference problems.

====Maximum entropy distribution====
Student&#x27;s  distribution is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate &quot;X&quot; for which formula_96 is fixed.
===Integral of Student&#x27;s probability density function and -value===
The function is the integral of Student&#x27;s probability density function, between   and , for It thus gives the probability that a value of &quot;t&quot; less than that calculated from observed data would occur by chance. Therefore, the function can be used when testing whether the difference between the means of two sets of data is statistically significant, by calculating the corresponding value of and the probability of its occurrence if the two sets of data were drawn from the same population. This is used in a variety of situations, particularly in tests. For the statistic , with degrees of freedom, is the probability that would be less than the observed value if the two means were the same (provided that the smaller mean is subtracted from the larger, so that It can be easily calculated from the cumulative distribution function of the  distribution:

:formula_97

where is the regularized incomplete beta function.

For statistical hypothesis testing this function is used to construct the &quot;p&quot;-value.

==Related distributions==
===In general===

* The noncentral  distribution generalizes the  distribution to include a noncentrality parameter. Unlike the nonstandardized  distributions, the noncentral distributions are not symmetric (the median is not the same as the mode).
* The &quot;discrete Student&#x27;s  distribution&quot; is defined by its probability mass function at &quot;r&quot; being proportional to: formula_98 Here &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;k&quot; are parameters. This distribution arises from the construction of a system of discrete distributions similar to that of the Pearson distributions for continuous distributions.
* One can generate Student samples by taking the ratio of variables from the normal distribution and the square-root of the . If we use instead of the normal distribution, e.g., the Irwin–Hall distribution, we obtain over-all a symmetric 4 parameter distribution, which includes the normal, the uniform, the triangular, the Student  and the Cauchy distribution. This is also more flexible than some other symmetric generalizations of the normal distribution.
*  distribution is an instance of ratio distributions.
* The square of a random variable distributed is distributed as Snedecor&#x27;s F distribution 

===Location-scale  distribution===
====Location-scale transformation====
Student&#x27;s  distribution generalizes to the three parameter &quot;location-scale  distribution&quot; formula_99 by introducing a location parameter formula_90 and a scale parameter formula_101 With
:formula_102
and location-scale family transformation
:formula_103
we get
:formula_104

The resulting distribution is also called the &quot;non-standardized Student&#x27;s  distribution&quot;.

====Density and first two moments====
The location-scale distribution has a density defined by:

:formula_105

Equivalently, the density can be written in terms of formula_106:

:formula_107

Other properties of this version of the distribution are:

:formula_108

====Special cases====
* If formula_109 follows a location-scale  distribution formula_110 then for formula_29 formula_109 is normally distributed formula_113 with mean formula_78 and variance formula_94
* The location-scale  distribution formula_116 with degree of freedom formula_117 is equivalent to the Cauchy distribution formula_118
* The location-scale  distribution formula_119 with formula_120 and formula_121 reduces to the Student&#x27;s  distribution formula_122

==Occurrence and applications==
===In frequentist statistical inference===
Student&#x27;s  distribution arises in a variety of statistical estimation problems where the goal is to estimate an unknown parameter, such as a mean value, in a setting where the data are observed with additive errors. If (as in nearly all practical statistical work) the population standard deviation of these errors is unknown and has to be estimated from the data, the  distribution is often used to account for the extra uncertainty that results from this estimation. In most such problems, if the standard deviation of the errors were known, a normal distribution would be used instead of the  distribution.

Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests are two statistical procedures in which the quantiles of the sampling distribution of a particular statistic (e.g. the standard score) are required. In any situation where this statistic is a linear function of the data, divided by the usual estimate of the standard deviation, the resulting quantity can be rescaled and centered to follow Student&#x27;s  distribution. Statistical analyses involving means, weighted means, and regression coefficients all lead to statistics having this form.

Quite often, textbook problems will treat the population standard deviation as if it were known and thereby avoid the need to use the Student&#x27;s  distribution. These problems are generally of two kinds: (1) those in which the sample size is so large that one may treat a data-based estimate of the variance as if it were certain, and (2) those that illustrate mathematical reasoning, in which the problem of estimating the standard deviation is temporarily ignored because that is not the point that the author or instructor is then explaining.

====Hypothesis testing====
A number of statistics can be shown to have  distributions for samples of moderate size under null hypotheses that are of interest, so that the  distribution forms the basis for significance tests. For example, the distribution of Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient , in the null case (zero correlation) is well approximated by the distribution for sample sizes above about 20.

====Confidence intervals====
Suppose the number &quot;A&quot; is so chosen that

:formula_123

when has a  distribution with degrees of freedom. By symmetry, this is the same as saying that satisfies

:formula_124

so &quot;A&quot; is the &quot;95th percentile&quot; of this probability distribution, or formula_125 Then

:formula_126

where is the sample standard deviation of the observed values. This is equivalent to

:formula_127

Therefore, the interval whose endpoints are

:formula_128

is a 90% confidence interval for μ. Therefore, if we find the mean of a set of observations that we can reasonably expect to have a normal distribution, we can use the  distribution to examine whether the confidence limits on that mean include some theoretically predicted value – such as the value predicted on a null hypothesis.

It is this result that is used in the Student&#x27;s  tests: since the difference between the means of samples from two normal distributions is itself distributed normally, the  distribution can be used to examine whether that difference can reasonably be supposed to be zero.

If the data are normally distributed, the one-sided confidence limit (UCL) of the mean, can be calculated using the following equation:

:formula_129
The resulting UCL will be the greatest average value that will occur for a given confidence interval and population size. In other words, formula_73 being the mean of the set of observations, the probability that the mean of the distribution is inferior to is equal to the confidence 

====Prediction intervals====
The  distribution can be used to construct a prediction interval for an unobserved sample from a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance.

===In Bayesian statistics===
The Student&#x27;s  distribution, especially in its three-parameter (location-scale) version, arises frequently in Bayesian statistics as a result of its connection with the normal distribution. Whenever the variance of a normally distributed random variable is unknown and a conjugate prior placed over it that follows an inverse gamma distribution, the resulting marginal distribution of the variable will follow a Student&#x27;s  distribution. Equivalent constructions with the same results involve a conjugate scaled-inverse-chi-squared distribution over the variance, or a conjugate gamma distribution over the precision. If an improper prior proportional to is placed over the variance, the  distribution also arises. This is the case regardless of whether the mean of the normally distributed variable is known, is unknown distributed according to a conjugate normally distributed prior, or is unknown distributed according to an improper constant prior.

Related situations that also produce a  distribution are:
* The marginal posterior distribution of the unknown mean of a normally distributed variable, with unknown prior mean and variance following the above model.
* The prior predictive distribution and posterior predictive distribution of a new normally distributed data point when a series of independent identically distributed normally distributed data points have been observed, with prior mean and variance as in the above model.

===Robust parametric modeling===
The  distribution is often used as an alternative to the normal distribution as a model for data, which often has heavier tails than the normal distribution allows for; see e.g. Lange et al. The classical approach was to identify outliers (e.g., using Grubbs&#x27;s test) and exclude or downweight them in some way. However, it is not always easy to identify outliers (especially in high dimensions), and the  distribution is a natural choice of model for such data and provides a parametric approach to robust statistics.

A Bayesian account can be found in Gelman et al. The degrees of freedom parameter controls the kurtosis of the distribution and is correlated with the scale parameter. The likelihood can have multiple local maxima and, as such, it is often necessary to fix the degrees of freedom at a fairly low value and estimate the other parameters taking this as given. Some authors report that values between 3 and 9 are often good choices. Venables and Ripley suggest that a value of 5 is often a good choice.

===Student&#x27;s  process===
For practical regression and prediction needs, Student&#x27;s  processes were introduced, that are generalisations of the Student  distributions for functions. A Student&#x27;s  process is constructed from the Student  distributions like a Gaussian process is constructed from the Gaussian distributions. For a Gaussian process, all sets of values have a multidimensional Gaussian distribution. Analogously, formula_131 is a Student  process on an interval formula_132 if the correspondent values of the process formula_133 (formula_134) have a joint multivariate Student  distribution. These processes are used for regression, prediction, Bayesian optimization and related problems. For multivariate regression and multi-output prediction, the multivariate Student  processes are introduced and used.

===Table of selected values===
The following table lists values for  distributions with degrees of freedom for a range of one-sided or two-sided critical regions. The first column is , the percentages along the top are confidence levels formula_135 and the numbers in the body of the table are the formula_136 factors described in the section on confidence intervals.

The last row with infinite gives critical points for a normal distribution since a  distribution with infinitely many degrees of freedom is a normal distribution. (See Related distributions above).

; Calculating the confidence interval :

Let&#x27;s say we have a sample with size 11, sample mean 10, and sample variance 2. For 90% confidence with 10 degrees of freedom, the one-sided  value from the table is 1.372 . Then with confidence interval calculated from

:formula_137

we determine that with 90% confidence we have a true mean lying below

:formula_138

In other words, 90% of the times that an upper threshold is calculated by this method from particular samples, this upper threshold exceeds the true mean.

And with 90% confidence we have a true mean lying above

:formula_139

In other words, 90% of the times that a lower threshold is calculated by this method from particular samples, this lower threshold lies below the true mean.

So that at 80% confidence (calculated from 100% − 2 × (1 − 90%) = 80%), we have a true mean lying within the interval

:formula_140

Saying that 80% of the times that upper and lower thresholds are calculated by this method from a given sample, the true mean is both below the upper threshold and above the lower threshold is not the same as saying that there is an 80% probability that the true mean lies between a particular pair of upper and lower thresholds that have been calculated by this method; see confidence interval and prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy.

Nowadays, statistical software, such as the R programming language, and functions available in many spreadsheet programs compute values of the  distribution and its inverse without tables.

==Computational methods==
===Monte Carlo sampling===
There are various approaches to constructing random samples from the Student&#x27;s  distribution. The matter depends on whether the samples are required on a stand-alone basis, or are to be constructed by application of a quantile function to uniform samples; e.g., in the multi-dimensional applications basis of copula-dependency. In the case of stand-alone sampling, an extension of the Box–Muller method and its polar form is easily deployed. It has the merit that it applies equally well to all real positive degrees of freedom, , while many other candidate methods fail if is close to zero.
==History==
In statistics, the  distribution was first derived as a posterior distribution in 1876 by Helmert and Lüroth. As such, Student&#x27;s t-distribution is an example of Stigler&#x27;s Law of Eponymy. The  distribution also appeared in a more general form as Pearson type IV distribution in Karl Pearson&#x27;s 1895 paper.

In the English-language literature, the distribution takes its name from William Sealy Gosset&#x27;s 1908 paper in &quot;Biometrika&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Student&quot;. One version of the origin of the pseudonym is that Gosset&#x27;s employer preferred staff to use pen names when publishing scientific papers instead of their real name, so he used the name &quot;Student&quot; to hide his identity. Another version is that Guinness did not want their competitors to know that they were using the  test to determine the quality of raw material.

Gosset worked at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, Ireland, and was interested in the problems of small samples – for example, the chemical properties of barley where sample sizes might be as few as 3. Gosset&#x27;s paper refers to the distribution as the &quot;frequency distribution of standard deviations of samples drawn from a normal population&quot;. It became well known through the work of Ronald Fisher, who called the distribution &quot;Student&#x27;s distribution&quot; and represented the test value with the letter .

<doc id="105389" wikidata="Q192474" url="?curid=105389" title="Jeff Beck">
<text>Geoffrey Arnold Beck (24 June 194410 January 2023) was an English guitarist. He rose to prominence as a member of the rock band the Yardbirds, and afterwards founded and fronted the Jeff Beck Group and Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice. In 1975, he switched to an instrumental style with focus on an innovative sound, and his releases spanned genres and styles ranging from blues rock, hard rock, jazz fusion and a blend of guitar-rock and electronica.

Beck has been consistently ranked in the top five of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and other magazines&#x27; lists of the greatest guitarists. He was often called a &quot;guitarist&#x27;s guitarist&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described him as &quot;one of the most influential lead guitarists in rock&quot;. Although he recorded two successful albums (1975&#x27;s &quot;Blow by Blow&quot; and 1976&#x27;s &quot;Wired&quot;) as a solo act, Beck did not establish or maintain commercial success like that of his contemporaries and bandmates. He recorded with many artists.

Beck earned wide critical praise and received the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance six times, winning in three categories at the 2010 Grammy Awards for a career total of eight Grammies. In 2014, he received the British Academy&#x27;s Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: first as a member of the Yardbirds (1992) and secondly as a solo artist (2009).

== Early life ==
Geoffrey Arnold Beck was born on 24 June 1944 to Arnold and Ethel Beck at 206 Demesne Road, Wallington, Surrey (now London Borough of Sutton, Greater London). As a ten-year-old, Beck sang in a church choir. He had a sister, Annetta. He attended Sutton Manor School and Sutton East County Secondary Modern School.

Beck cited Les Paul as the first electric guitar player who impressed him. Beck said that he first heard an electric guitar when he was six years old and heard Paul playing &quot;How High the Moon&quot; on the radio. He asked his mother what it was. After she replied it was an electric guitar and was all tricks, he said, &quot;That&#x27;s for me&quot;. Cliff Gallup, lead guitarist with Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps, was also an early musical influence, followed by B. B. King and Steve Cropper. Beck considered Lonnie Mack &quot;a rock guitarist [who] was unjustly overlooked [and] a major influence on him and many others.&quot;

As a teenager, he learned to play on a borrowed guitar and made several attempts to build his own instrument, first by gluing and bolting together cigar boxes for the body and an unsanded fence post for the neck with model aircraft control lines and frets simply painted on it.

After leaving school, he attended Wimbledon School of Art (now Wimbledon College of Arts). Then, he was briefly employed as a painter and decorator, a groundsman on a golf course, and a car paint sprayer. Beck&#x27;s sister Annetta introduced him to Jimmy Page when both were teenagers.

== Career ==

=== Beginnings and Yardbirds: 1963–1967 ===

While attending Wimbledon College of Art, Beck played in a succession of groups. In 1963, after Ian Stewart of the Rolling Stones introduced him to R&amp;B, he formed The Nightshift with whom he played at the 100 Club in Oxford Street. Beck joined the Rumbles, a Croydon band, in 1963 for a short period as lead guitarist, playing Gene Vincent and Buddy Holly songs, displaying a talent for mimicking guitar styles. Later in 1963, he joined the Tridents, a band from the Chiswick area. &quot;They were really my scene because they were playing flat-out R&amp;B, like Jimmy Reed stuff, and we supercharged it all up and made it really rocky. I got off on that, even though it was only twelve-bar blues.&quot; He was a session guitarist on a 1964 Parlophone single by the Fitz and Startz titled &quot;I&#x27;m Not Running Away&quot;, with B-side &quot;So Sweet&quot;. Also in 1964, Beck was part of Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages when they recorded &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot;/&quot;Come Back Baby&quot; for Oriole Records.

In March 1965, Beck was recruited by the Yardbirds to succeed Eric Clapton on the recommendation of fellow session musician Jimmy Page, who had been their initial choice. The Yardbirds recorded most of their Top 40 hit songs during Beck&#x27;s short but significant 20-month tenure with the band allowing him only one full album, which became known as &quot;Roger the Engineer&quot; (titled &quot;Over Under Sideways Down&quot; in the U.S.), released in 1966. In May 1966, Beck recorded an instrumental titled &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot;. Rather than members of the Yardbirds, he was backed by Page on 12-string rhythm guitar, Keith Moon on drums, John Paul Jones on bass, and Nicky Hopkins on piano. In June, Page joined the Yardbirds, at first on bass and later on second lead guitar. This dual lead-guitar lineup was filmed performing an adaptation of &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot;, titled &quot;Stroll On&quot;, for the 1966 Michelangelo Antonioni film &quot;Blowup&quot;.

Beck was fired during a U.S. tour for being a consistent no-show and for difficulties caused by his perfectionism and explosive temper on stage.

=== Band leader and co-leader: 1967 to 1974 ===
In 1967, he recorded several solo singles for pop producer Mickie Most, including &quot;Hi Ho Silver Lining&quot; and &quot;Tallyman&quot;, which also included his vocals. He then formed the Jeff Beck Group, which included Rod Stewart on vocals, Ronnie Wood on bass, Nicky Hopkins on piano, and Aynsley Dunbar on drums (replaced by Micky Waller).

The group produced two albums for Columbia Records (Epic in the US): &quot;Truth&quot; (as Jeff Beck, August 1968) and &quot;Beck-Ola&quot; (July 1969). &quot;Truth,&quot; released five months before the first Led Zeppelin album, features &quot;You Shook Me&quot;, a song written by Willie Dixon and first recorded by Muddy Waters, also covered on the Led Zeppelin debut with a similar arrangement. It sold well (reaching No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts). &quot;Beck-Ola&quot; saw drummer Micky Waller replaced by Tony Newman, and, while well-received, was less successful both commercially and critically. Resentment, coupled with touring incidents, led the group to disband in July 1969.

In his autobiography, Nick Mason recalls that, during 1967, Pink Floyd had wanted to recruit Beck to be its guitarist after the departure of Syd Barrett, but &quot;none of us had the nerve to ask him.&quot; In 1969, following the death of Brian Jones, Beck was approached about joining the Rolling Stones.

After the break-up of his group, Beck took part in the &quot;Music from Free Creek&quot; &quot;super session&quot; project, billed as &quot;A. N. Other&quot; and contributed lead guitar on four songs, including one co-written by him. In September 1969, he teamed with the rhythm section of Vanilla Fudge: bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice (when they were in England to resolve contractual issues), but when Beck fractured his skull in a car accident near Maidstone in December the plan was postponed for two-and-a-half years, during which time Bogert and Appice formed Cactus. Beck later remarked on the 1960s period of his life: &quot;Everyone thinks of the 1960s as something they really weren&#x27;t. It was the frustration period of my life. The electronic equipment just wasn&#x27;t up to the sounds I had in my head.&quot;

In 1970, after Beck had regained his health, he set about forming a band with the drummer Cozy Powell. Beck, Powell, and producer Mickie Most flew to the United States and recorded several tracks at Motown&#x27;s famed Studio A in Hitsville U.S.A. with the Funk Brothers, Motown&#x27;s in-house band, but the results remained unreleased. By April 1971 Beck had completed the line-up of this new group with guitarist/vocalist Bobby Tench, keyboard player Max Middleton, and bassist Clive Chaman. The new band performed as &quot;The Jeff Beck Group&quot; but had a substantially different sound from the first line-up.

&quot;Rough and Ready&quot; (October 1971), the first album they recorded, on which Beck wrote or co-wrote six of the album&#x27;s seven tracks, included elements of soul, rhythm-and-blues, and jazz, foreshadowing the direction Beck&#x27;s music would take later in the decade.

A second album, &quot;Jeff Beck Group&quot; (July 1972), was recorded at TMI studios in Memphis with the same personnel. Beck employed Steve Cropper as producer and the album displayed a strong soul influence, five of the nine tracks being covers of songs by American artists. One, &quot;I Got to Have a Song&quot;, was the first of four Stevie Wonder compositions covered by Beck. Shortly after the release of the &quot;Jeff Beck Group&quot; album, the band was dissolved and Beck&#x27;s management put out the statement that: &quot;The fusion of the musical styles of the various members has been successful within the terms of individual musicians, but they didn&#x27;t feel it had led to the creation of a new musical style with the strength they had originally sought&quot;.

Beck then started collaborating with bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice, who became available following the demise of Cactus but continued touring as the Jeff Beck Group in August 1972, to fulfill contractual obligations with his promoter, with a line-up including Bogert, Appice, Max Middleton and vocalist Kim Milford. After six appearances, Milford was replaced by Bobby Tench, who was flown in from the United Kingdom for the &quot;Arie Crown Theatre&quot; Chicago performance and the rest of the tour, which concluded at the Paramount North West Theatre, Seattle. After the tour, Tench and Middleton left the band and the power trio Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice emerged. Appice took on the role of vocalist with Bogert and Beck contributing occasionally.

They were included on the bill for &quot;Rock at The Oval&quot; in September 1972, still as &quot;The Jeff Beck Group&quot;, which marked the start of a tour schedule of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany. Another U.S. tour began in October 1972, starting at the Hollywood Sportatorium Florida and concluding on 11 November 1972 at The Warehouse in New Orleans. In April 1973 the album &quot;Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice&quot; was released (on Epic Records). While critics acknowledged the band&#x27;s instrumental prowess the album was not commercially well received except for its cover of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s hit &quot;Superstition&quot;.

On 3 July 1973, Beck joined David Bowie onstage to perform &quot;The Jean Genie&quot;/&quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;Around and Around&quot;. The show was filmed and was finally released in the 2022 Bowie documentary &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;. During October 1973 Beck recorded tracks for Michael Fennelly&#x27;s album &quot;Lane Changer&quot;.

Early in January 1974, Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice played at the Rainbow Theatre in London as part of a European tour. The concert was broadcast in full on the U.S. show &quot;Rock Around the World&quot; in September of the same year. This last recorded work by the band previewed material intended for a second studio album, included on the bootleg &quot;At Last Rainbow&quot;. The tracks &quot;Blues Deluxe&quot; and &quot;BBA Boogie&quot; from this concert were later included on the Jeff Beck compilation &quot;Beckology&quot; (1991).

Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice dissolved in April 1974 before their second studio album (produced by Jimmy Miller) was finished. Their live album &quot;Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice Live in Japan&quot;, recorded during their 1973 tour of Japan, was not released until February 1975 by Epic/Sony.

After a few months, Beck entered Underhill Studio and met with the band Upp; he recruited them to be the backing band for his appearance on the BBC TV program &quot;Guitar Workshop&quot; in August 1974. Beck produced and played on their self-titled debut album and their second album &quot;This Way Upp&quot;, though his contributions to the second album went uncredited. During 1974, he participated in recording sessions for the first album by former Jeff Beck Group member Bobby Tench&#x27;s band Hummingbird&#x27; but did not contribute to the album. 

=== Going solo: 1974 to 1980 ===
In October the same year, Beck began to record instrumental sessions at AIR Studios with Max Middleton who was also associated with Hummingbird, bassist Phil Chen and drummer Richard Bailey using George Martin as producer and arranger. These formed the basis for Beck&#x27;s solo album &quot;Blow by Blow&quot; (March 1975) and showcased Beck&#x27;s technical prowess in jazz-rock. The album reached number four in the charts and is Beck&#x27;s most commercially successful release. Beck, fastidious about overdubs and often dissatisfied with his solos, often returned to AIR Studios until he was satisfied. A couple of months after the sessions had finished, producer George Martin received a telephone call from Beck, who wanted to record a solo section again. Bemused, Martin replied: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Jeff, but the record is in the shops!&quot;

Beck put together a live band for a US tour, which was preceded by a small and unannounced gig at The Newlands Tavern in Peckham, London. He toured through April and May 1975, mostly supporting the Mahavishnu Orchestra, retaining Max Middleton on keyboards but with a new rhythm section of bassist Wilbur Bascomb and noted session drummer Bernard &quot;Pretty&quot; Purdie, who was also associated with Hummingbird.

In a May 1975 show in Cleveland at the Music Hall, he became frustrated with an early version of a talk box he used on his arrangement of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;She&#x27;s a Woman&quot;, and after breaking a string, tossed his legendary Yardbirds-era Fender Stratocaster guitar off the stage. He did the same with the talk box and finished the show playing a Les Paul guitar without the box. During this tour he performed at Yuya Uchida&#x27;s &quot;World Rock Festival&quot;, playing eight songs with Purdie. In addition, he performed a guitar and drum instrumental with Johnny Yoshinaga and, at the end of the festival, joined in a live jam with bassist Felix Pappalardi of Mountain and vocalist Akira &quot;Joe&quot; Yamanaka from the Flower Travellin&#x27; Band. Only his set with Purdie was recorded and released.

Beck returned to the studio and recorded &quot;Wired&quot; (1976), which paired ex-Mahavishnu Orchestra drummer and composer Narada Michael Walden and keyboardist Jan Hammer. The album used a jazz-rock fusion style, which sounded similar to the work of his two collaborators. To promote the album, Beck joined forces with the Jan Hammer Group, playing a show supporting Alvin Lee at The Roundhouse in May 1976, before embarking on a seven-month-long world tour. This resulted in the live album &quot;Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group Live&quot; (1977).

At this point, Beck was a tax exile and took up residency in the US, remaining there until his return to the UK in the autumn of 1977. In the spring of 1978, he began rehearsing with ex-Return to Forever bassist Stanley Clarke and drummer Gerry Brown towards a projected appearance at the Knebworth Festival, but this was cancelled after Brown dropped out. Beck toured Japan for three weeks in November 1978 with an ad hoc group consisting of Clarke and newcomers Tony Hymas (keyboards) and Simon Phillips (drums).

Work then began on a new studio album at the Who&#x27;s Ramport Studios in London and continued sporadically throughout 1979, resulting in &quot;There &amp; Back&quot; in June 1980. It featured three tracks composed and recorded with Jan Hammer, while five were written with Hymas. Stanley Clarke was replaced by Mo Foster on bass, both on the album and the subsequent tours. Its release was followed by extensive touring in the US, Japan, and the UK.

=== Collaboration years: 1980s and 1990s ===

In 1981, Beck made a series of historic live appearances with his Yardbirds predecessor Eric Clapton at the Amnesty International-sponsored benefit concerts dubbed &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; shows. In that show, he appeared with Clapton on &quot;Crossroads&quot;, &quot;Further on Up the Road&quot;, and his arrangement of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Cause We&#x27;ve Ended As Lovers&quot;. Beck also featured prominently in an all-star band finale performance of &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; with Clapton, Sting, Phil Collins, Donovan, and Bob Geldof. Beck&#x27;s contributions were seen and heard in the resulting album and film, both of which achieved worldwide success in 1982. Another benefit show, the ARMS Concert for multiple sclerosis, featured a jam with Beck, Eric Clapton, and Jimmy Page, during which they performed &quot;Tulsa Time&quot; and &quot;Layla&quot;.

In 1985, Beck released &quot;Flash&quot;, featuring a variety of vocalists, but most notably former bandmate Rod Stewart on a rendition of Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;People Get Ready&quot;. The aforementioned cover song was also released as a single which went on to become a hit. A video was made for the track and the clip achieved heavy rotation on MTV. The two also played a few dates together during this time but a full tour in tandem never materialized. At Stewart&#x27;s induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, Beck gave the induction speech saying of Stewart, &quot;We have a love hate relationship—he loves me and I hate him.&quot; During this time, Beck made several guest appearances with other performers, including one in the 1988 movie &quot;Twins&quot;, where he played guitar with singer Nicolette Larson.

After a four-year break, he made a return to instrumental music with the 1989 album &quot;Jeff Beck&#x27;s Guitar Shop&quot;, the first album to feature Beck as a fingerstyle guitarist, leaving the plectrum playing style. It was only his third album to be released in the 1980s. Much of Beck&#x27;s sparse and sporadic recording schedule was due in part to a long battle with tinnitus.

In the 1990s, Beck had a higher musical output. He contributed to Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s solo debut album &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; in 1990, playing the main solo of the album&#x27;s title song, which was also the theme song to the movie &quot;Young Guns II&quot;. The same year, he was a featured performer on Hans Zimmer&#x27;s score for the film &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;. He played lead guitar on Roger Waters&#x27; 1992 concept album &quot;Amused to Death&quot;, and on the 1993 albums &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; by Kate Bush and &quot;Love Scenes&quot; by Beverley Craven. He recorded the 1992 instrumental soundtrack album &quot;Frankie&#x27;s House&quot;, as well as &quot;Crazy Legs&quot; (1993), a tribute album to 1950s rockabilly group Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps and their influential guitarist Cliff Gallup.

Beck rehearsed with Guns N&#x27; Roses for their concert in Paris in 1992, but did not play in the actual concert due to ear damage caused by a Matt Sorum cymbal crash, causing Beck to become temporarily deaf. The Yardbirds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. In Beck&#x27;s acceptance speech, he humorously noted that &quot;Someone told me I should be proud tonight... But I&#x27;m not, because they kicked me out... They did... Fuck them!&quot;

He accompanied Paul Rodgers of Bad Company on the album &quot;Muddy Water Blues: A Tribute to Muddy Waters&quot; in 1993.

=== Solo career renewal: 1999 to 2020s ===

Beck&#x27;s next release was in 1999, his first foray into guitar-based electronica, &quot;Who Else!&quot;. The album was Beck&#x27;s first collaboration with a female instrumentalist, Jennifer Batten, in touring, writing, and recording as well as the first time he had worked with another guitarist on his own material since playing in the Yardbirds. Beck continued to work with Batten through the post-release tour of &quot;You Had It Coming&quot; in 2001.

Beck won his third Grammy Award, this one for &quot;Best Rock Instrumental Performance&quot; for the track &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; from &quot;You Had It Coming&quot; (2000). The song &quot;Plan B&quot; from the 2003 release &quot;Jeff&quot;, earned Beck his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, and was proof that the new electro-guitar style he used for the two earlier albums would continue to dominate. Beck was the opening act for B.B. King in the summer of 2003 and appeared at Eric Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads Guitar Festival in 2004. Additionally, in 2004, Beck was featured on the song &quot;54-46 Was My Number&quot; by Toots and the Maytals as part of the album &quot;True Love&quot; which won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album.

In 2007, he accompanied Kelly Clarkson for her cover of Patty Griffin&#x27;s &quot;Up to the Mountain&quot;, during the Idol Gives Back episode of &quot;American Idol&quot;. The performance was recorded live and afterward, was immediately released for sale. In the same year, he appeared once again at Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads Guitar Festival, performing with Vinnie Colaiuta, Jason Rebello, and then 21-year-old bassist Tal Wilkenfeld.

Beck announced a world tour in early 2009 and remained faithful to the same lineup of musicians as in his tour two years before, playing and recording at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s in London to a sold-out audience. Beck played on the song &quot;Black Cloud&quot; on the 2009 Morrissey album &quot;Years of Refusal&quot; and later that year, Harvey Goldsmith became Beck&#x27;s manager.
Beck was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist on 4 April 2009; the award was presented by Jimmy Page. Beck performed &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot; along with Page, Ronnie Wood, Joe Perry, Flea, and Metallica members James Hetfield, Robert Trujillo, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Jason Newsted.
On 4 July 2009, David Gilmour joined Beck onstage at the Albert Hall. Beck and Gilmour traded solos on &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and closed the show with &quot;Hi Ho Silver Lining&quot;.

Beck&#x27;s album &quot;Emotion &amp; Commotion&quot; was released in April 2010. It features a mixture of original songs and covers such as &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot; and Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Corpus Christi Carol&quot;, interpreted through Beck&#x27;s &quot;uniquely sensitive touch&quot;. Joss Stone and Imelda May provided some of the guest vocals. Two tracks from &quot;Emotion &amp; Commotion&quot; won Grammy Awards in 2011: &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance, and &quot;Hammerhead&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Beck collaborated on &quot;Imagine&quot; for the 2010 Herbie Hancock album, &quot;The Imagine Project&quot; along with Seal, P!nk, India.Arie, Konono N°1, Oumou Sangare and others and received a third Grammy in 2011 for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for the track.

Beck&#x27;s 2010 World Tour band featured Grammy-winning musician Narada Michael Walden on drums, Rhonda Smith on bass, and Jason Rebello on keyboards. He released a live album titled &quot;Live and Exclusive from the Grammy Museum&quot; on 25 October 2010. On 9 June 2010 Beck with Imelda May&#x27;s band recorded a DVD named &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Party (Honoring Les Paul)&quot;, of a concert at the Iridium in NYC featuring several Les Paul songs (with Ms. May doing the Mary Ford vocals).
In 2011, Beck received two honorary degrees from British universities. On 18 July 2011, he was honoured with a fellowship from the University of the Arts London in recognition of his &quot;outstanding contribution to the field of Music&quot;. On 21 July 2011, Beck was also presented with an honorary doctorate from the University of Sussex (by Sanjeev Bhaskar, the university&#x27;s chancellor), the citation stating that the honour acknowledged &quot;an outstanding musical career and celebrated the relationship between the university and the Brighton Institute of Modern Music (BIMM)&quot;.

In 2013, it was announced that Beck would be performing on Beach Boys founder Brian Wilson&#x27;s solo album (alongside Beach Boys Al Jardine and David Marks) on Capitol Records. On 20 June, Wilson&#x27;s website announced that the material might be split into three albums: one of new pop songs, another of mostly instrumental tracks with Beck, and another of interwoven tracks dubbed &quot;the suite&quot;. Beck also accompanied Wilson (along with Jardine and Marks) on an 18-date fall 2013 tour, which started in late September and ended in late October (prior to which, Beck made clear that he regarded sharing the stage with Wilson as a complete honour for himself).

In 2014, to mark the beginning of Jeff&#x27;s World Tour in Japan, a three-track CD titled &quot;Yosogai&quot; was released on 5 April; the album had yet to be finalized at the time of the tour. In November 2014, he accompanied Joss Stone at The Royal British Legion&#x27;s Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall.

For the 2016 album &quot;Loud Hailer&quot;, Beck teamed up with Carmen Vandenberg and Rosie Bones of Bones UK. The album protests the state of the world, with titles ranging from &quot;Thugs&#x27; Club&quot; via &quot;Scared for the Children&quot; to &quot;O.I.L. (Can&#x27;t Get Enough of That Sticky)&quot;.

On 16 April 2020, Beck released a new single, in which he collaborated with Johnny Depp to record John Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Isolation&quot;, explaining that this was a first record release from an ongoing musical collaboration between the two men. They had been recording music together for some time, with the track being produced the year before, but Beck explained that the decision to release it was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns: &quot;We weren&#x27;t expecting to release it so soon but given all the hard days and true &#x27;isolation&#x27; that people are going through in these challenging times, we decided now might be the right time to let you all hear it&quot;.
On 2 June 2022, Beck was in the news after Depp appeared with him at The Sage in Gateshead, following his victory in the high-profile defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard. Both also had performed at the Royal Albert Hall in London earlier in the week. Beck and Depp&#x27;s first single from their collaborative album &quot;18&quot;, titled &quot;This Is a Song for Miss Hedy Lamarr&quot;, was announced on 10 June 2022.

Beck is featured on two tracks (the title track and &quot;A Thousand Shades&quot;) from Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s album &quot;Patient Number 9&quot;, which was released on 24 June 2022. On Dion DiMucci&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;Blues with Friends&quot; he played lead guitar on &quot;Can&#x27;t Start Over Again.&quot;

Beck&#x27;s final recording before his death was his contribution to a supergroup recording of &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; to support the Teenage Cancer Trust and Teen Cancer America.

== Style and influence ==

Described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as &quot;one of the most influential lead guitarists in rock&quot;, Beck cited his major influences as Les Paul, the Shadows, Cliff Gallup, Ravi Shankar, Roy Buchanan, Chet Atkins, Django Reinhardt, Steve Cropper and Lonnie Mack. Beck said John McLaughlin &quot;has given us so many different facets of the guitar and introduced thousands of us to world music, by blending Indian music with jazz and classical. I&#x27;d say he was the best guitarist alive.&quot; McLaughlin also praised Beck, calling Beck his favorite progressive rock artist.

According to musicologist and historian Bob Gulla, Beck is credited for popularising the use of audio feedback and distortion on guitar. During his short time with the Yardbirds, Beck&#x27;s experimentation with feedback, distortion, and &quot;fuzz&quot; tone &quot;pushed the band into directions that would open the door for psychedelic rock&quot; while &quot;jolt[ing] British rock forward&quot;, according to Gulla. While Beck was not the first rock guitarist to experiment with electronic distortion, he nonetheless helped to redefine the sound and role of the electric guitar in rock music. His use of a commercial fuzz box for the Yardbirds&#x27; &quot;Heart Full of Soul&quot; (June 1965) has been cited as perhaps the first significant use of the effect. Beck&#x27;s work with the Yardbirds and the Jeff Beck Group&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Truth&quot; were seminal influences on heavy metal music, which emerged in full force in the early 1970s. Gulla identifies one of Beck&#x27;s characteristic traits to be his sense of pitch, particularly in exercising the whammy bar to create sounds ranging from &quot;nose-diving bombs to subtle, perfectly pitched harmonic melodies&quot;.

According to guitarist and author Jack Wilkins, Beck is regarded alongside Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as one of his generation&#x27;s greatest guitarists, receiving praise for his technical skill and versatile playing. Stephen Thomas Erlewine finds him to be &quot;as innovative as Jimmy Page, as tasteful as Eric Clapton, and nearly as visionary as Jimi Hendrix&quot;, although unable to achieve their mainstream success, &quot;primarily because of the haphazard way he approached his career&quot; while often lacking a star singer to help make his music more accessible. On his recorded output by 1991, Erlewine remarked that &quot;never has such a gifted musician had such a spotty discography&quot;, believing Beck had largely released &quot;remarkably uneven&quot; solo records and only &quot;a few terrific albums&quot;. In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau essentialised Beck as &quot;a technician&quot; and questioned his ability to &quot;improvise long lines, or jazz it up with a modicum of delicacy, or for that matter get funky&quot;, although he later observed a &quot;customary focus, loyalty, and consistency of taste&quot;.

In 2015, Beck was ranked No. 5 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists&quot;. In an accompanying essay, guitarist Mike Campbell applauded Beck for his &quot;brilliant technique&quot; and &quot;personality&quot; in his playing, including a sense of humour, expressed through the growl of his wah-wah effects. Campbell also credited Beck with expanding the boundaries of the blues, particularly in his two collaborations with Stewart.

== Technique and equipment ==

The guitar model Beck is most associated with is the Fender Stratocaster, which he started playing in 1969. In a 2013 interview, Beck said, &quot;The Fender Stratocaster was made for me. I believe it was. [...] It&#x27;s the tool for rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll. Nothing they can do to it will make it any better than it&#x27;s already been.&quot;

In 1987, Beck had asked that the newly opened Fender Custom Shop make a Stratocaster guitar to his specifications. The resulting guitar became known for its graffiti yellow colour, to match Beck&#x27;s 1932 Ford Hot Rod. Based on these specifications, Fender released the &quot;Strat Plus&quot;, as Beck had vetoed the use of his name to market that model. However, in 1991, Fender did release a Jeff Beck Stratocaster with some of those same features, which as of 2024 has been on the market continuously, with updates at various times, and particularly significant changes made in 2001. An additional Jeff Beck Custom Shop stratocaster was released in 2004.
Beck also played Fender Telecaster and Gibson Les Paul instruments, and continued to play these for special occasions even after the 1990s, when he had transitioned to the Stratocaster as his main instrument for live performances. Gibson released the limited edition &quot;Jeff Beck 1954 Les Paul Oxblood&quot; model in two different finishes in 2009.

Beck&#x27;s amplifiers were primarily Fender and Marshall. In his earlier days with the Yardbirds, Beck also used a 1954 Fender Esquire guitar (now owned by Seymour W. Duncan and housed in the Cleveland Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) through Vox AC30s. He also played through a variety of fuzz pedals and echo units along with this set-up and used the Pro Co RAT distortion pedal. The pickup is based on a Gibson pickup rewound by Duncan and used in a salvaged Telecaster dubbed the &quot;Tele-Gib&quot; which he had constructed as a gift to Beck. Scott Morgan of the Rationals, who at one point shared a dressing room with the Yardbirds, recalls how Beck amplified his lead guitar through a Vox Super Beatle while using banjo strings for the unwound G string on his guitar because &quot;they didn&#x27;t make sets with an unwound G at that point.&quot;
Beck stopped the regular use of a guitar pick in the 1980s. He produced a wide variety of sounds on the Stratocaster by using his thumb to pluck the guitar strings, his ring finger on the volume knob, and his little finger on the vibrato bar. By plucking a string and then &#x27;fading in&#x27; the sound with the volume knob he created a unique sound that can resemble a human voice, among other effects. He frequently used wah-wah pedals and slides both live and in the studio. Eric Clapton once said, &quot;With Jeff, it&#x27;s all in his hands&quot;.

Ninety of Beck&#x27;s guitars are to be auctioned by Christie&#x27;s in London on 22 January 2025, along with over 40 other items from his personal collection. Some of the auction items will be on public display in Los Angeles and the whole set will be shown in London prior to their sale.

==Long term collaborators==
:&quot;The graph below includes musicians who have worked on multiple occasions (concerts or published music) with Jeff Beck or for a long time continuously, been on more than one album with him, or have done at least quite a substantial part of a tour with him. Overlap between personnel and albums on this graph does not always mean that that personnel was present on that album as some parallel projects overlapped in time.&quot;
== Personal life and death ==
From 1963 to 1967, Beck was married to Patricia Brown. However, this relationship had deteriorated by the time Beck joined the Yardbirds. During the Yardbirds years, Beck began a relationship with American model and actress Mary Hughes, whom he moved in with when his relationship with the Yardbirds broke down. By 1968, Beck had entered what would be a nearly 18-year relationship with the English model Celia Hammond, whose portrait appears on the album cover of &quot;Truth&quot;. In 2005, he married Sandra Cash. He had no children.

At the time of his death, Beck lived in a Grade II-listed building called &quot;Riverhall&quot; in the civil parish of Wadhurst, East Sussex. Beck became a vegetarian in 1969 and was a patron of the Folly Wildlife Rescue Trust. He also had an interest in classic Ford hot rods, performing much of the work on the exteriors and engines of the cars by himself.

Beck died from a bacterial meningitis infection at a hospital near Riverhall on 10 January 2023, at the age of 78. Within minutes of his death announcement, musicians and friends began paying tribute; Jimmy Page wrote that &quot;The six stringed Warrior is no longer here for us to admire the spell he could weave around our mortal emotions. Jeff could channel music from the ethereal. His technique unique. His imaginations apparently limitless. Jeff I will miss you along with your millions of fans&quot;. Mick Jagger expressed his condolences, writing &quot;With the death of Jeff Beck we have lost a wonderful man and one of the greatest guitar players in the world. We will all miss him so much.&quot; Ronnie Wood, a former bandmate of Beck&#x27;s, stated &quot;Now Jeff has gone, I feel like one of my band of brothers has left this world, and I&#x27;m going to dearly miss him.&quot; 

Beck&#x27;s funeral service took place at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Beddington, Sutton on 3 February. Mourners included Johnny Depp, Rod Stewart, Eric Clapton, Tom Jones, Ronnie Wood, David Gilmour, Bob Geldof, Robert Plant, and Chrissie Hynde. Jimmy Page delivered a eulogy referring to Jeff Beck as &quot;the quiet chief&quot;. A private burial, with only Beck&#x27;s widow Sandra, the couple&#x27;s dog, and Johnny Depp in attendance, followed at Riverhall.

==Awards==

Beck was the winner of eight Grammy awards, the first being Best Rock Instrumental Performance for &quot;Escape&quot; from the album &quot;Flash&quot; at the 1986 Grammys.

The asteroid 38431 Jeffbeck is named after him.

<text>A pheromone () is a secreted or excreted chemical factor that triggers a social response in members of the same species. Pheromones are chemicals capable of acting like hormones outside the body of the secreting individual, to affect the behavior of the receiving individuals. There are &quot;alarm pheromones&quot;, &quot;food trail pheromones&quot;, &quot;sex pheromones&quot;, and many others that affect behavior or physiology. Pheromones are used by many organisms, from basic unicellular prokaryotes to complex multicellular eukaryotes. Their use among insects has been particularly well documented. In addition, some vertebrates, plants and ciliates communicate by using pheromones. The ecological functions and evolution of pheromones are a major topic of research in the field of chemical ecology.

==Background==
The portmanteau word &quot;pheromone&quot; was coined by Peter Karlson and Martin Lüscher in 1959, based on the Greek φέρω &quot;phérō&quot; (&#x27;I carry&#x27;) and ὁρμων &quot;hórmōn&quot; (&#x27;stimulating&#x27;). Pheromones are also sometimes classified as ecto-hormones. They were researched earlier by various scientists, including Jean-Henri Fabre, Joseph A. Lintner, Adolf Butenandt, and ethologist Karl von Frisch who called them various names, such as &quot;alarm substances&quot;. These chemical messengers are transported outside of the body and affect neurocircuits, including the autonomous nervous system with hormone or cytokine mediated physiological changes, inflammatory signaling, immune system changes and/or behavioral change in the recipient. They proposed the term to describe chemical signals from conspecifics that elicit innate behaviors soon after the German biochemist Adolf Butenandt had characterized the first such chemical, bombykol, a chemically well-characterized pheromone released by the female silkworm to attract mates.

==Categorization by function==

===Aggregation===
Aggregation pheromones function in mate choice, overcoming host resistance by mass attack, and defense against predators. A group of individuals at one location is referred to as an aggregation, whether consisting of one sex or both sexes. Male-produced sex attractants have been called aggregation pheromones, because they usually result in the arrival of both sexes at a calling site and increase the density of conspecifics surrounding the pheromone source. Most sex pheromones are produced by the females; only a small percentage of sex attractants are produced by males. Aggregation pheromones have been found in members of the Coleoptera, Collembola, Diptera, Hemiptera, Dictyoptera, and Orthoptera. In recent decades, aggregation pheromones have proven useful in the management of many pests, such as the boll weevil (&quot;Anthonomus grandis&quot;), the pea and bean weevil (&quot;Sitona lineatus&quot;, and stored product weevils (e.g. &quot;Sitophilus zeamais&quot;, &quot;Sitophilus granarius&quot;, and &quot;Sitophilus oryzae&quot;). Aggregation pheromones are among the most ecologically selective pest suppression methods. They are non-toxic and effective at very low concentrations.

===Alarm===

Some species release a volatile substance when attacked by a predator that can trigger flight (in aphids) or aggression (in ants, bees, termites, and wasps) in members of the same species. For example, &quot;Vespula squamosa&quot; use alarm pheromones to alert others to a threat. In &quot;Polistes exclamans&quot;, alarm pheromones are also used as an alert to incoming predators. Pheromones also exist in plants: Certain plants emit alarm pheromones when grazed upon, resulting in tannin production in neighboring plants. These tannins make the plants less appetizing to herbivores.

An alarm pheromone has been documented in a mammalian species. Alarmed pronghorn, &quot;Antilocapra americana&quot; flair their white rump hair and exposes two highly odoriferous glands that releases a compound described having the odor &quot;reminiscent of buttered popcorn&quot;. This sends a message to other pronghorns by both sight and smell about a present danger. This scent has been observed by humans 20 to 30 meters downwind from alarmed animals. The major odour compound identified from this gland is 2-pyrrolidinone.

===Epideictic===
Epideictic pheromones are different from territory pheromones, when it comes to insects. Fabre observed and noted how &quot;females who lay their eggs in these fruits deposit these mysterious substances in the vicinity of their clutch to signal to other females of the same species they should clutch elsewhere.&quot; It may be helpful to note that the word epideictic, having to do with display or show (from the Greek &#x27;deixis&#x27;), has a different but related meaning in rhetoric, the human art of persuasion by means of words.

===Territorial===

Laid down in the environment, territorial pheromones mark the boundaries and identity of an organism&#x27;s territory. Cats and dogs deposit these pheromones by urinating on landmarks that mark the perimeter of the claimed territory. In social seabirds, the preen gland is used to mark nests, nuptial gifts, and territory boundaries with behavior formerly described as &#x27;displacement activity&#x27;.

===Trail===

Social insects commonly use trail pheromones. For example, ants mark their paths with pheromones consisting of volatile hydrocarbons. Certain ants lay down an initial trail of pheromones as they return to the nest with food. This trail attracts other ants and serves as a guide. As long as the food source remains available, visiting ants will continuously renew the pheromone trail. The pheromone requires continuous renewal because it evaporates quickly. When the food supply begins to dwindle, the trail-making ceases. Pharaoh ants (&quot;Monomorium pharaonis&quot;) mark trails that no longer lead to food with a repellent pheromone, which causes avoidance behaviour in ants.
Repellent trail markers may help ants to undertake more efficient collective exploration. 
The army ant &quot;Eciton burchellii&quot; provides an example of using pheromones to mark and maintain foraging paths. When species of wasps such as &quot;Polybia sericea&quot; found new nests, they use pheromones to lead the rest of the colony to the new nesting site.

Gregarious caterpillars, such as the forest tent caterpillar, lay down pheromone trails that are used to achieve group movement.

===Sex===
In animals, sex pheromones indicate the availability of the female for breeding. Male animals may also emit pheromones that convey information about their species and genotype.

At the microscopic level, a number of bacterial species (e.g. &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot;) release specific chemicals into the surrounding media to induce the &quot;competent&quot; state in neighboring bacteria. Competence is a physiological state that allows bacterial cells to take up DNA from other cells and incorporate this DNA into their own genome, a sexual process called transformation.

Among eukaryotic microorganisms, pheromones promote sexual interaction in numerous species. These species include the yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, the filamentous fungi &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; and Mucor mucedo, the water mold &quot;Achlya ambisexualis&quot;, the aquatic fungus &quot;Allomyces macrogynus&quot;, the slime mold &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;, the ciliate protozoan &quot;Blepharisma japonicum&quot; and the multicellular green algae &quot;Volvox carteri&quot;. In addition, male copepods can follow a three-dimensional pheromone trail left by a swimming female, and male gametes of many animals use a pheromone to help find a female gamete for fertilization.

Many well-studied insect species, such as the ant &quot;Leptothorax acervorum&quot;, the moths &quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; and &quot;Agrotis ipsilon&quot;, the bee &quot;Xylocopa sonorina,&quot; the frog Pseudophryne bibronii, and the butterfly Edith&#x27;s checkerspot release sex pheromones to attract a mate, and some lepidopterans (moths and butterflies) can detect a potential mate from as far away as . Some insects, such as ghost moths, use pheromones during lek mating. Traps containing pheromones are used by farmers to detect and monitor insect populations in orchards. In addition, &quot;Colias eurytheme &quot;butterflies release pheromones, an olfactory cue important for mate selection. In mealworm beetles, &quot;Tenebrio molitor,&quot; the female preference of pheromones is dependent on the nutritional condition of the males. 

The effect of Hz-2V virus infection on the reproductive physiology and behavior of female &quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; moths is that in the absence of males they exhibited calling behavior and called as often but for shorter periods on average than control females. Even after these contacts virus-infected females made many frequent contacts with males and continued to call; they were found to produce five to seven times more pheromone and attracted twice as many males as did control females in flight tunnel experiments.

Pheromones are also utilized by bee and wasp species. Some pheromones can be used to suppress the sexual behavior of other individuals allowing for a reproductive monopoly – the wasp &quot;R. marginata &quot;uses this. With regard to the &quot;Bombus hyperboreus&quot; species, males, otherwise known as drones, patrol circuits of scent marks (pheromones) to find queens. In particular, pheromones for the &quot;Bombus hyperboreus,&quot; include octadecenol, 2,3-dihydro-6-transfarnesol, citronellol, and geranylcitronellol.

Sea urchins release pheromones into the surrounding water, sending a chemical message that triggers other urchins in the colony to eject their sex cells simultaneously.

In plants, some homosporous ferns release a chemical called antheridiogen, which affects sex expression. This is very similar to pheromones.

===Other===
This classification, based on the effects on behavior, remains artificial. Pheromones fill many additional functions.
* Nasonov pheromones (worker bees)
* Royal pheromones (bees)
* Calming (appeasement) pheromones (mammals)
* Necromones, given off by a deceased and decomposing organism; consisting of oleic and linoleic acids, they allow crustaceans and hexapods to identify the presence of dead conspecifics.
* Suckling: TAA is present in rabbit milk and seems to play a role of pheromone inducing suckling in the newborn rabbit.

==Categorization by type==
===Releaser===
Releaser pheromones are pheromones that cause an alteration in the behavior of the recipient. For example, some organisms use powerful attractant molecules to attract mates from a distance of two miles or more. In general, this type of pheromone elicits a rapid response, but is quickly degraded. In contrast, a primer pheromone has a slower onset and a longer duration. For example, rabbit (mothers) release mammary pheromones that trigger immediate nursing behavior by their babies.

===Primer===
Primer pheromones trigger a change of developmental events (in which they differ from all the other pheromones, which trigger a change in behavior). They were first described in &quot;Schistocerca gregaria&quot; by Maud Norris in 1954.

===Signal===
Signal pheromones cause short-term changes, such as the neurotransmitter release that activates a response. For instance, GnRH molecule functions as a neurotransmitter in rats to elicit lordosis behavior.

==Pheromone receptors==
===In the olfactory epithelium===

The human trace amine-associated receptors are a group of six G protein-coupled receptors (i.e., TAAR1, TAAR2, TAAR5, TAAR6, TAAR8, and TAAR9) that – with exception for TAAR1 – are expressed in the human olfactory epithelium. In humans and other animals, TAARs in the olfactory epithelium function as olfactory receptors that detect volatile amine odorants, including certain pheromones; these TAARs putatively function as a class of pheromone receptors involved in the olfactive detection of social cues.

A review of studies involving non-human animals indicated that TAARs in the olfactory epithelium can mediate attractive or aversive behavioral responses to a receptor agonist. This review also noted that the behavioral response evoked by a TAAR can vary across species (e.g., TAAR5 mediates attraction to trimethylamine in mice and aversion to trimethylamine in rats). In humans, hTAAR5 presumably mediates aversion to trimethylamine, which is known to act as an hTAAR5 agonist and to possess a foul, fishy odor that is aversive to humans; however, hTAAR5 is not the only olfactory receptor that is responsible for trimethylamine olfaction in humans. hTAAR5-mediated trimethylamine aversion has not been examined in published research.

===In the vomeronasal organ===

In reptiles, amphibia and non-primate mammals pheromones are detected by regular olfactory membranes, and also by the vomeronasal organ (VNO), or Jacobson&#x27;s organ, which lies at the base of the nasal septum between the nose and mouth and is the first stage of the accessory olfactory system. While the VNO is present in most amphibia, reptiles, and non-primate mammals, it is absent in birds, adult catarrhine monkeys (downward facing nostrils, as opposed to sideways), and apes. An active role for the human VNO in the detection of pheromones is disputed; while it is clearly present in the fetus it appears to be atrophied, shrunk or completely absent in adults. Three distinct families of vomeronasal receptors, putatively pheromone sensing, have been identified in the vomeronasal organ named V1Rs, V2Rs, and V3Rs. All are G protein-coupled receptors but are only distantly related to the receptors of the main olfactory system, highlighting their different role.

==Evolution==
Olfactory processing of chemical signals like pheromones exists in all animal phyla and is thus the oldest of the senses. It has been suggested that it serves survival by generating appropriate behavioral responses to the signals of threat, sex and dominance status among members of the same species.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that in the evolution of unicellular prokaryotes to multicellular eukaryotes, primordial pheromone signaling between individuals may have evolved to paracrine and endocrine signaling within individual organisms.

Some authors assume that approach-avoidance reactions in animals, elicited by chemical cues, form the phylogenetic basis for the experience of emotions in humans.

===Evolution of sex pheromones===
====Avoidance of inbreeding====

Mice can distinguish close relatives from more distantly related individuals on the basis of scent signals, which enables them to avoid mating with close relatives and minimizes deleterious inbreeding.

In addition to mice, two species of bumblebee, in particular Bombus bifarius and Bombus frigidus, have been observed to use pheromones as a means of kin recognition to avoid inbreeding. For example, B. bifarius males display &quot;patrolling&quot; behavior in which they mark specific paths outside their nests with pheromones and subsequently &quot;patrol&quot; these paths. Unrelated reproductive females are attracted to the pheromones deposited by males on these paths, and males that encounter these females while patrolling can mate with them. Other bees of the Bombus species are found to emit pheromones as precopulatory signals, such as &quot;Bombus lapidarius&quot;.

==Applications==

===Pheromone trapping===

Pheromones of certain pest insect species, such as the Japanese beetle, acrobat ant, and the spongy moth, can be used to trap the respective insect for monitoring purposes, to control the population by creating confusion, to disrupt mating, and to prevent further egg laying.

===Animal husbandry===
Pheromones are used in the detection of oestrus in sows. Boar pheromones are sprayed into the , and those sows that exhibit sexual arousal are known to be currently available for breeding.

==Human sex pheromone controversies==

While humans are highly dependent upon visual cues, when in close proximity smells also play a role in sociosexual behaviors. An inherent difficulty in studying human pheromones is the need for cleanliness and odorlessness in human participants. Though various researchers have investigated the possibility of their existence, no pheromonal substance has ever been demonstrated to directly influence human behavior in a peer reviewed study. Experiments have focused on three classes of possible human pheromones: axillary steroids, vaginal aliphatic acids, and stimulators of the vomeronasal organ, including this 2018 study claiming pheromones affect men&#x27;s sexual cognition.

=== Axillary steroids ===
Axillary steroids are produced by the testes, ovaries, apocrine glands, and adrenal glands. These chemicals are not biologically active until puberty when sex steroids influence their activity. The change in activity during puberty suggest that humans may communicate through odors. Several axillary steroids have been described as possible human pheromones: androstadienol, androstadienone, androstenol, androstenone, and androsterone.
* Androstenol is the putative female pheromone. In a 1978 study by Kirk-Smith, people wearing surgical masks treated with androstenol or untreated were shown pictures of people, animals and buildings and asked to rate the pictures on attractiveness. Individuals with their masks treated with androstenol rated their photographs as being &quot;warmer&quot; and &quot;more friendly&quot;. The best-known case study involves the synchronization of menstrual cycles among women based on unconscious odor cues, the &quot;McClintock effect&quot;, named after the primary investigator, Martha McClintock, of the University of Chicago. A group of women were exposed to a whiff of perspiration from other women. Depending on the time in the month the sweat was collected (before, during, or after ovulation) there was an association with the recipient woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle to speed up or slow down. The 1971 study proposed two types of pheromone involved: &quot;One, produced prior to ovulation, shortens the ovarian cycle; and the second, produced just at ovulation, lengthens the cycle&quot;. However, recent studies and reviews of the methodology have called the validity of her results and existence of menstrual synchronization into question.
* Androstenone is postulated to be secreted only by males as an attractant for women, and thought to be a positive effector for their mood. It seems to have different effects on women, depending on where a female is in her menstrual cycle, with the highest sensitivity to it during ovulation. In 1983, study participants exposed to androstenone were shown to undergo changes in skin conductance. Androstenone has been found to be perceived as more pleasant to women during their time of ovulation.
* Androstadienone seems to affect the limbic system and causes a positive reaction in women, improving mood. Responses to androstadienone depend on the individual and the environment they are in. Androstadienone negatively influences the perception of pain in women. Women tend to react positively after androstadienone presentation, while men react more negatively. In an experiment by Hummer and McClintock, androstadienone or a control odor was put on the upper lips of fifty males and females and they were tested for four effects of the pheromone: 1) automatic attention towards positive and negative facial expressions, 2) the strength of cognitive and emotional information as distractors in a simple reaction time task, 3) relative attention to social and nonsocial stimuli (i.e. neutral faces), and 4) mood and attentiveness in the absence of social interaction. Those treated with androstadienone drew more attention to towards emotional facial expressions and emotional words but no increased attention to neutral faces. These data suggest that androstadienone may increase attention to emotional information causing the individual to feel more focused. It is thought that androstadienone modulates on how the mind attends and processes information.

While it may be expected on evolutionary grounds that humans have pheromones, these three molecules have yet to be rigorously proven to act as such. Research in this field has suffered from small sample sizes, publication bias, false positives, and poor methodology.

=== Vaginal aliphatic acids ===
A class of aliphatic acids (volatile fatty acids as a kind of carboxylic acid) was found in female rhesus monkeys that produced six types in the vaginal fluids. The combination of these acids is referred to as &quot;copulins&quot;. One of the acids, acetic acid, was found in all of the sampled female&#x27;s vaginal fluid. Even in humans, one-third of women have all six types of copulins, which increase in quantity before ovulation. Copulins are used to signal ovulation; however, as human ovulation is concealed it is thought that they may be used for reasons other than sexual communication.

=== Stimulators of the vomeronasal organ ===
The human vomeronasal organ has epithelia that may be able to serve as a chemical sensory organ; however, the genes that encode the VNO receptors are nonfunctional pseudogenes in humans. Also, while there are sensory neurons in the human VNO there seem to be no connections between the VNO and the central nervous system. The associated olfactory bulb is present in the fetus, but regresses and vanishes in the adult brain. There have been some reports that the human VNO does function, but only responds to hormones in a &quot;sex-specific manner&quot;. There also have been pheromone receptor genes found in olfactory mucosa. There have been no experiments that compare people lacking the VNO, and people that have it. It is disputed on whether the chemicals are reaching the brain through the VNO or other tissues.

In 2006, it was shown that a second mouse receptor sub-class is found in the olfactory epithelium. Called the trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR), some are activated by volatile amines found in mouse urine, including one putative mouse pheromone. Orthologous receptors exist in humans providing, the authors propose, evidence for a mechanism of human pheromone detection.

Although there are disputes about the mechanisms by which pheromones function, there is evidence that pheromones do affect humans. Despite this evidence, it has not been conclusively shown that humans have functional pheromones. Those experiments suggesting that certain pheromones have a positive effect on humans are countered by others indicating they have no effect whatsoever.

A possible theory being studied now is that these axillary odors are being used to provide information about the immune system. Milinski and colleagues found that the artificial odors that people chose are determined in part by their major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) combination. Information about an individual&#x27;s immune system could be used as a way of &quot;sexual selection&quot; so that the female could obtain good genes for her offspring. Claus Wedekind and colleagues found that both men and women prefer the axillary odors of people whose MHC is different from their own.

Some body spray advertisers claim that their products contain human sexual pheromones that act as an aphrodisiac. Despite these claims, no pheromonal substance has ever been demonstrated to directly influence human behavior in a peer reviewed study. Thus, the role of pheromones in human behavior remains speculative and controversial.

<doc id="105391" wikidata="Q223770" url="?curid=105391" title="B movie">
<text>A B movie, or B film, is a type of cheap, low budget commercial motion picture. Originally, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, this term specifically referred to films meant to be shown as the lesser-known second half of a double feature, somewhat similar to B-sides in recorded music. However, the production of such films as &quot;second features&quot; in the United States largely declined by the end of the 1950s. This shift was due to the rise of commercial television, which prompted film studio B movie production departments to transition into television film production divisions. These divisions continued to create content similar to B movies, albeit in the form of low-budget films and series.

Today, the term &quot;B movie&quot; is used in a broader sense. In post-Golden Age usage, B movies can encompass a wide spectrum of films, ranging from sensationalistic exploitation films to independent arthouse productions.

In either usage, most B movies represent a particular genre: the Western was a Golden Age B movie staple, while low-budget science-fiction and horror films became more popular in the 1950s. Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character. Almost always shorter than the top-billed feature films, many had running times of 70 minutes or less. The term connoted a general perception that B movies were inferior to the more lavishly budgeted headliners; individual B films were often ignored by critics.

Latter-day B movies still sometimes inspire multiple sequels, but series are less common. As the average running time of top-of-the-line films increased, so did that of B pictures. In its current usage, the term has somewhat contradictory connotations: it may signal an opinion that a certain movie is (a) a &quot;genre film&quot; with minimal artistic ambitions or (b) a lively, energetic film uninhibited by the constraints imposed on more expensive projects and unburdened by the conventions of putatively serious independent film. The term is also now used loosely to refer to some higher-budget, mainstream films with exploitation-style content, usually in genres traditionally associated with the B movie.

From their beginnings to the present day, B movies have provided opportunities both for those coming up in the profession and others whose careers are waning. Celebrated filmmakers such as Anthony Mann and Jonathan Demme learned their craft in B movies. They are where actors such as John Wayne and Jack Nicholson first became established, and they have provided work for former A movie actors and actresses, such as Vincent Price and Karen Black. Some actors and actresses, such as Bela Lugosi, Eddie Constantine, Bruce Campbell, and Pam Grier, worked in B movies for most of their careers. The terms &quot;B actor and actress&quot; are sometimes used to refer to performers who find work primarily or exclusively in B pictures.

==History==
In 1927–28, at the end of the silent era, the production cost of an average feature from a major Hollywood studio ranged from $190,000 at Fox to $275,000 at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. That average reflected both &quot;specials&quot; that might cost as much as and films made quickly for around $50,000. These cheaper films (not yet called &quot;B movies&quot;) allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio&#x27;s more important productions, while also breaking in new personnel.

Studios in the minor leagues of the industry, such as Columbia Pictures and Film Booking Offices of America (FBO), focused on exactly those sorts of cheap productions. Their movies, with relatively short running times, targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs, particularly small-town and urban neighborhood venues, or &quot;nabes&quot;. Even smaller production houses, known as Poverty Row studios, made films whose costs might run as low as $3,000, seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns.

With the widespread arrival of sound film in American theaters in 1929, many independent exhibitors began dropping the then-dominant presentation model, which involved live acts and a broad variety of shorts before a single featured film. A new programming scheme developed that soon became standard practice: a newsreel, a short and/or serial, and a cartoon, followed by a double feature. The second feature, which actually screened before the main event, cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time in shorts.

The majors&#x27; &quot;clearance&quot; rules favoring their affiliated theaters prevented timely access to top-quality films for independent theaters; the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead. The additional movie also gave the program &quot;balance&quot;, the practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill. The low-budget picture of the 1920s thus evolved into the second feature, the B movie, of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age.

The major studios, at first resistant to the double feature, soon adapted; all established B units to provide films for the expanding second-feature market. Block booking became standard practice: to get access to a studio&#x27;s attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company&#x27;s entire output for a season. With the B films rented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set virtually guaranteeing the profitability of every B movie. The parallel practice of blind bidding largely freed the majors from worrying about their Bs&#x27; quality; even when booking in less than seasonal blocks, exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen. The five largest studios: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Fox Film Corporation (20th Century Fox as of 1935), Warner Bros., and RKO Radio Pictures (descendant of FBO), also belonged to companies with sizable theater chains, further securing the bottom line.

Poverty Row studios, from modest outfits like Mascot Pictures, Tiffany Pictures, and Sono Art-World Wide Pictures, down to shoestring operations, made exclusively B movies, serials, and other shorts, and also distributed totally independent productions and imported films. In no position to directly block book, they mostly sold regional distribution exclusivity to &quot;states rights&quot; firms, which in turn peddled blocks of movies to exhibitors, typically six or more pictures featuring the same star (a relative status on Poverty Row). Two &quot;major-minors&quot;, Universal Studios and rising Columbia Pictures had production lines roughly similar to, though somewhat better endowed than, the top Poverty Row studios. In contrast to the Big Five majors, Universal and Columbia had few or no theaters, though they did have top-rank film distribution exchanges.

In the standard Golden Age model, the industry&#x27;s top product, the A films, premiered at a small number of select first-run houses in major cities. Double features were not the rule at these prestigious venues. As described by Edward Jay Epstein, &quot;During these first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising.&quot; Then it was off to the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of smaller, independent theaters, programs often changed two or three times a week. To meet the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as &quot;quickies&quot; for their tight production schedules—as short as four days.

As Azam Patel describes, &quot;Many of the poorest theaters, such as the &#x27;grind houses&#x27; in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily.&quot; Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the trailers, or screen previews, that presaged its arrival, &quot;[t]he new film&#x27;s title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got&quot;, writes Epstein. Aside from at the theater itself, B films might not be advertised at all.

The introduction of sound had driven costs higher: by 1930, the average U.S. feature film cost $375,000 to produce. A broad range of motion pictures occupied the B category. The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films, but also movies classifiable as &quot;programmers&quot; (also known as &quot;in-betweeners&quot; or &quot;intermediates&quot;). As Taves describes, &quot;Depending on the prestige of the theater and the other material on the double bill, a programmer could show up at the top or bottom of the marquee.&quot;

On Poverty Row, many Bs were made on budgets that would have barely covered petty cash on a major&#x27;s A film, with costs at the bottom of the industry running as low as $5,000. By the mid-1930s, the double feature was the dominant U.S. exhibition model, and the majors responded. In 1935, B movie production at Warner Bros. was raised from 12 to 50% of studio output. The unit was headed by Bryan Foy, known as the &quot;Keeper of the Bs&quot;. At Fox, which also shifted half of its production line into B territory, Sol M. Wurtzel was similarly in charge of more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s.
A number of the top Poverty Row firms consolidated: Sono Art joined another company to create Monogram Pictures early in the decade. In 1935, Monogram, Mascot, and several smaller studios merged to establish Republic Pictures. The former heads of Monogram soon sold off their Republic shares and set up a new Monogram production house. Into the 1950s, most Republic and Monogram product was roughly on par with the low end of the majors&#x27; output. Less sturdy Poverty Row concerns, with a penchant for grand sobriquets like Conquest, Empire, Imperial, and Peerless, continued to churn out dirt-cheap quickies. Joel Finler has analyzed the average length of feature releases in 1938, indicating the studios&#x27; relative emphasis on B production (United Artists produced little, focusing on the distribution of prestigious films from independent outfits; Grand National, active 1936–40, occupied an analogous niche on Poverty Row, releasing mostly independent productions):
Taves estimates that half of the films produced by the eight majors in the 1930s were B movies. Calculating in the three hundred or so films made annually by the many Poverty Row firms, approximately 75% of Hollywood movies from the decade, more than four thousand pictures, are classifiable as Bs.

The Western was by far the predominant B genre in both the 1930s and, to a lesser degree, the 1940s. Film historian Jon Tuska has argued that &quot;the &#x27;B&#x27; product of the Thirties—the Universal films with [Tom] Mix, [Ken] Maynard, and [Buck] Jones, the Columbia features with Buck Jones and Tim McCoy, the RKO George O&#x27;Brien series, the Republic Westerns with John Wayne and the Three Mesquiteers achieved a uniquely American perfection of the well-made story.&quot; At the far end of the industry, Poverty Row&#x27;s Ajax put out oaters starring Harry Carey, then in his fifties. The Weiss outfit had the Range Rider series, the American Rough Rider series, and the Morton of the Mounted &quot;northwest action thrillers&quot;. One low-budget oater of the era, made totally outside the studio system, profited from an outrageous concept: a Western with a cast consisting of only little people, &quot;The Terror of Tiny Town&quot; (1938) was such a success in its independent bookings that Columbia picked it up for distribution.

Series of various genres, featuring recurrent, title-worthy characters or name actors in familiar roles, were particularly popular during the first decade of sound film. Fox&#x27;s many B series, for instance, included Charlie Chan mysteries, Ritz Brothers comedies, and musicals with child star Jane Withers. These series films are not to be confused with the short, cliffhanger-structured serials that sometimes appeared on the same program. As with serials, however, many series were intended to attract young people—a theater that twin-billed part-time might run a &quot;balanced&quot; or entirely youth-oriented double feature as a matinee and then a single film for a more mature audience at night. In the words of one industry report, afternoon moviegoers, &quot;composed largely of housewives and children, want quantity for their money while the evening crowds want &#x27;something good and not too much of it.

Series films are often unquestioningly consigned to the B movie category, but even here there is ambiguity: at MGM, for example, popular series like the Andy Hardy and the Dr. Kildare–Dr. Gillespie chronicles had leading stars and budgets that would have been A-level at most of the lesser studios. For many series, even a lesser major&#x27;s standard B budget was far out of reach: Poverty Row&#x27;s Consolidated Pictures featured Tarzan, the Police Dog in a series with the proud name of Melodramatic Dog Features.

====1940s====
By 1940, the average production cost of an American feature was $400,000, a negligible increase over ten years. A number of small Hollywood companies had folded around the turn of the decade, including the ambitious Grand National, but a new firm, Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, fifty percent of theaters were double-billing exclusively, and others employed the policy part-time.

In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures. Restrictions were also placed on the majors&#x27; ability to enforce blind bidding. These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B movie suppliers. Genre pictures made at very low cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row, with even Republic&#x27;s and Monogram&#x27;s budgets rarely climbing over $200,000. Many smaller Poverty Row firms folded as the eight majors, with their proprietary distribution exchanges, now commanded about 95% of American and Canadian box office receipts.

In 1946, independent producer David O. Selznick brought his bloated-budget spectacle &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; to market with heavy nationwide promotion and wide release. The distribution strategy was a major success, despite what was widely perceived as the movie&#x27;s poor quality. The &quot;Duel&quot; release anticipated practices that fueled the B movie industry in the late 1950s; when the top Hollywood studios made them standard two decades after that, the B movie was hard hit.

Considerations beside cost made the line between A and B movies ambiguous. Films shot on B-level budgets were occasionally marketed as A pictures or emerged as sleeper hits: one of 1943&#x27;s biggest films was &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Children&quot;, an RKO thriller made for a fraction over $200,000. It earned more than in rentals, industry language for a distributor&#x27;s share of gross box office receipts. Particularly in the realm of film noir, A pictures sometimes echoed visual styles generally associated with cheaper films. Programmers, with their flexible exhibition role, were ambiguous by definition. As late as 1948, the double feature remained a popular exhibition mode. It was standard policy at 25% of theaters and used part-time at an additional 36%.

The leading Poverty Row firms began to broaden their scope; in 1947, Monogram established a subsidiary, Allied Artists, to develop and distribute relatively expensive films, mostly from independent producers. Around the same time, Republic launched a similar effort under the &quot;Premiere&quot; rubric. In 1947 as well, PRC was subsumed by Eagle-Lion, a British company seeking entry to the American market. Warners&#x27; former &quot;Keeper of the Bs&quot;, Brian Foy, was installed as production chief.
In the 1940s, RKO stood out among the industry&#x27;s Big Five for its focus on B pictures. From a latter-day perspective, the most famous of the major studios&#x27; Golden Age B units is Val Lewton&#x27;s horror unit at RKO. Lewton produced such moody, mysterious films as &quot;Cat People&quot; (1942), &quot;I Walked with a Zombie&quot; (1943), and &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot; (1945), directed by Jacques Tourneur, Robert Wise, and others who became renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect. The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir, &quot;Stranger on the Third Floor&quot; (1940), a 64-minute B, was produced at RKO, which released many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein.

The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s. Though many of the best-known film noirs were A-level productions, most 1940s pictures in the mode were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill. In the decades since, these cheap entertainments, generally dismissed at the time, have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age.

In one sample year, 1947, RKO produced along with several noir programmers and A pictures, two straight B noirs: &quot;Desperate&quot; and &quot;The Devil Thumbs a Ride&quot;. Ten B noirs that year came from Poverty Row&#x27;s big three: Republic, Monogram, and PRC/Eagle-Lion, and one came from tiny Screen Guild. Three majors beside RKO contributed a total of five more. Along with these eighteen unambiguous B noirs, an additional dozen or so noir programmers came out of Hollywood.

Still, most of the majors&#x27; low-budget production remained the sort now largely ignored. RKO&#x27;s representative output included the Mexican Spitfire and Lum and Abner comedy series, thrillers featuring the Saint and the Falcon, Westerns starring Tim Holt, and Tarzan movies with Johnny Weissmuller. Jean Hersholt played Dr. Christian in six films between 1939 and 1941. &quot;The Courageous Dr. Christian&quot; (1940) was a standard entry: &quot;In the course of an hour or so of screen time, the saintly physician managed to cure an epidemic of spinal meningitis, demonstrate benevolence towards the disenfranchised, set an example for wayward youth, and calm the passions of an amorous old maid.&quot;

Down in Poverty Row, low budgets led to less palliative fare. Republic aspired to major-league respectability while making many cheap and modestly budgeted Westerns, but there was not much from the bigger studios that compared with Monogram &quot;exploitation pictures&quot; like juvenile delinquency exposé &quot;Where Are Your Children?&quot; (1943) and the prison film &quot;Women in Bondage&quot; (1943). In 1947, PRC&#x27;s &quot;The Devil on Wheels&quot; brought together teenagers, hot rods, and death. The little studio had its own house auteur: with his own crew and relatively free rein, director Edgar G. Ulmer was known as &quot;the Capra of PRC&quot;. Ulmer made films of every generic stripe: his &quot;Girls in Chains&quot; was released in May 1943, six months before &quot;Women in Bondage&quot;; by the end of the year, Ulmer had also made the teen-themed musical &quot;Jive Junction&quot; as well as &quot;Isle of Forgotten Sins&quot;, a South Seas adventure set around a brothel.

===Transition in the 1950s===

In 1948, a Supreme Court ruling in a federal antitrust suit against the majors outlawed block booking and led to the Big Five divesting their theater chains. With audiences draining away to television and studios scaling back production schedules, the classic double feature vanished from many American theaters during the 1950s. The major studios promoted the benefits of recycling, offering former headlining movies as second features in the place of traditional B films. With television airing many classic Westerns as well as producing its own original Western series, the cinematic market for B oaters in particular was drying up. After barely inching forward in the 1930s, the average U.S. feature production cost had essentially doubled over the 1940s, reaching by the turn of the decade—a 93% rise after adjusting for inflation.

The first prominent victim of the changing market was Eagle-Lion, which released its last films in 1951. By 1953, the old Monogram brand had disappeared, the company having adopted the identity of its higher-end subsidiary, Allied Artists. The following year, Allied released Hollywood&#x27;s last B series Westerns. Non-series B Westerns continued to appear for a few more years, but Republic Pictures, long associated with cheap sagebrush sagas, was out of the filmmaking business by decade&#x27;s end. In other genres, Universal kept its Ma and Pa Kettle series going through 1957, while Allied Artists stuck with the Bowery Boys until 1958. RKO, weakened by years of mismanagement, exited the movie industry in 1957.

Hollywood&#x27;s A product was getting longer, the top ten box-office releases of 1940 had averaged 112.5 minutes; the average length of 1955&#x27;s top ten was 123.4. In their modest way, the Bs were following suit. The age of the hour-long feature film was past; 70 minutes was now roughly the minimum. While the Golden Age-style second feature was dying, &quot;B movie&quot; was still used to refer to any low-budget genre film featuring relatively unheralded performers (sometimes referred to as &quot;B actors&quot;). The term retained its earlier suggestion that such movies relied on formulaic plots, &quot;stock&quot; character types, and simplistic action or unsophisticated comedy. At the same time, the realm of the B movie was becoming increasingly fertile territory for experimentation, both serious and outlandish.

Ida Lupino, a leading actress, established herself as Hollywood&#x27;s sole female director of the era. In short, low-budget pictures made for her production company, The Filmakers, Lupino explored taboo subjects such as rape in 1950&#x27;s &quot;Outrage&quot; and 1953&#x27;s self-explanatory &quot;The Bigamist&quot;. Her best known directorial effort, &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot;, a 1953 RKO release, is the only film noir from the genre&#x27;s classic period directed by a woman. That year, RKO released &quot;Split Second&quot;, which concludes in a nuclear test range, and is perhaps the first &quot;atomic noir&quot;.

The most famous such movie, the independently produced &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; (1955), typifies the persistently murky middle ground between the A and B picture, as Richard Maltby describes: a &quot;programmer capable of occupying either half of a neighbourhood theatre&#x27;s double-bill, [it was] budgeted at approximately $400,000. [Its] distributor, United Artists, released around twenty-five programmers with production budgets between $100,000 and $400,000 in 1955.&quot; The film&#x27;s length, 106 minutes, is A level, but its star, Ralph Meeker, had previously appeared in only one major film. Its source is pure pulp, one of Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer novels, but Robert Aldrich&#x27;s direction is self-consciously aestheticized. The result is a brutal genre picture that also evokes contemporary anxieties about what was often spoken of simply as the Bomb.
The fear of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, along with less expressible qualms about radioactive fallout from America&#x27;s own atomic tests, energized many of the era&#x27;s genre films. Science fiction, horror, and various hybrids of the two were now of central economic importance to the low-budget end of the business. Most down-market films of the type—like many of those produced by William Alland at Universal (such as &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; (1954)) and Sam Katzman at Columbia (including &quot;It Came from Beneath the Sea&quot; (1955))—provided little more than thrills, though their special effects could be impressive.

But these were genres whose fantastic nature could also be used as cover for mordant cultural observations often difficult to make in mainstream movies. Director Don Siegel&#x27;s &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1956), released by Allied Artists, treats conformist pressures and the evil of banality in haunting, allegorical fashion. &quot;The Amazing Colossal Man&quot; (1957), directed by Bert I. Gordon, is both a monster movie that happens to depict the horrific effects of radiation exposure and &quot;a ferocious cold-war fable [that] spins Korea, the army&#x27;s obsessive secrecy, and America&#x27;s post-war growth into one fantastic whole&quot;.

&quot;The Amazing Colossal Man&quot; was released by a new company whose name was much bigger than its budgets. American International Pictures (AIP), founded in 1956 by James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff in a reorganization of their American Releasing Corporation (ARC), soon became the leading American studio devoted entirely to B-cost productions. American International helped keep the original-release double bill alive through paired packages of its films: these movies were low-budget, but instead of a flat rate, they were rented out on a percentage basis, like A films.

The success of &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; (1957) thus brought AIP a large return, made for about $100,000, it grossed more than . As the film&#x27;s title suggests, the studio relied on both fantastic genre subjects and new, teen-oriented angles. When &quot;Hot Rod Gang&quot; (1958) turned a profit, hot rod horror was given a try: &quot;Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow&quot; (1959). David Cook credits AIP with leading the way &quot;in demographic exploitation, target marketing, and saturation booking, all of which became standard procedure for the majors in planning and releasing their mass-market &#x27;event&#x27; films&quot; by the late 1970s. In terms of content, the majors were already there, with films about juvenile delinquency such as Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Untamed Youth&quot; (1957) and MGM&#x27;s &quot;High School Confidential&quot; (1958), both starring Mamie Van Doren.

In 1954, a young filmmaker named Roger Corman received his first screen credits as writer and associate producer of Allied Artists&#x27; &quot;Highway Dragnet&quot;. Corman soon independently produced his first movie, &quot;Monster from the Ocean Floor&quot;, on a $12,000 budget and a six-day shooting schedule. Among the six films he worked on in 1955, Corman produced and directed the first official ARC release, &quot;Apache Woman&quot;, and &quot;Day the World Ended&quot;, half of Arkoff and Nicholson&#x27;s first twin-bill package. Corman directed over fifty feature films through 1990. As of 2007, he remained active as a producer, with more than 350 movies to his credit. Often referred to as the &quot;King of the Bs&quot;, Corman has said that &quot;to my way of thinking, I never made a &#x27;B&#x27; movie in my life&quot;, as the traditional B movie was dying out when he began making pictures. He prefers to describe his metier as &quot;low-budget exploitation films&quot;. In later years Corman, both with AIP and as head of his own companies, helped launch the careers of Francis Ford Coppola, Jonathan Demme, Robert Towne, and Robert De Niro, among many others.

In the late 1950s, William Castle became known as the great innovator of the B movie publicity gimmick. Audiences of &quot;Macabre&quot; (1958), an $86,000 production distributed by Allied Artists, were invited to take out insurance policies to cover potential death from fright. The 1959 creature feature &quot;The Tingler&quot; featured Castle&#x27;s most famous gimmick, Percepto: at the film&#x27;s climax, buzzers attached to select theater seats unexpectedly rattled a few audience members, prompting either appropriate screams or even more appropriate laughter. With such films, Castle &quot;combine[d] the saturation advertising campaign perfected by Columbia and Universal in their Sam Katzman and William Alland packages with centralized and standardized publicity stunts and gimmicks that had previously been the purview of the local exhibitor&quot;.

The postwar drive-in theater boom was vital to the expanding independent B movie industry. In January 1945, there were 96 drive-ins in the United States; a decade later, there were more than 3,700. Unpretentious pictures with simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing, with all its attendant distractions. The phenomenon of the drive-in movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s. At the same time, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the midnight movie.

Increasingly, American-made genre films were joined by foreign movies acquired at low cost and, where necessary, dubbed for the U.S. market. In 1956, distributor Joseph E. Levine financed the shooting of new footage with American actor Raymond Burr that was edited into the Japanese sci-fi horror film &quot;Godzilla&quot;. The British Hammer Film Productions made the successful &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; (1957) and &quot;Dracula&quot; (1958), major influences on future horror film style. In 1959, Levine&#x27;s Embassy Pictures bought the worldwide rights to &quot;Hercules&quot;, a cheaply made Italian movie starring American-born bodybuilder Steve Reeves. On top of a $125,000 purchase price, Levine then spent on advertising and publicity, a virtually unprecedented amount.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; was not impressed, claiming that the movie would have drawn &quot;little more than yawns in the film market ... had it not been [launched] throughout the country with a deafening barrage of publicity&quot;. Levine counted on first-weekend box office for his profits, booking the film &quot;into as many cinemas as he could for a week&#x27;s run, then withdrawing it before poor word-of-mouth withdrew it for him&quot;. &quot;Hercules&quot; opened at a remarkable 600 theaters, and the strategy was a smashing success: the film earned in domestic rentals. Just as valuable to the bottom line, it was even more successful overseas. Within a few decades, Hollywood was dominated by both movies and an exploitation philosophy very much like Levine&#x27;s.

Also playing rounds during this time was K. Gordon Murray, known for distributing international matinee fare like the 1959 Mexican kids&#x27; movie &quot;Santa Claus&quot;.

===Golden age of exploitation===

====1960s====

Despite all the transformations in the industry, by 1961 the average production cost of an American feature film was still only —after adjusting for inflation, less than 10% more than it had been in 1950. The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters. The AIP-style dual genre package was the new model. In July 1960, the latest Joseph E. Levine sword-and-sandals import, &quot;Hercules Unchained&quot;, opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. A suspense film, &quot;Terror Is a Man&quot;, ran as a &quot;co-feature&quot; with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: &quot;The dénouement helpfully includes a &#x27;warning bell&#x27; so the sensitive can &#x27;close their eyes. That year, Roger Corman took AIP down a new road: &quot;When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color.&quot; The resulting &quot;House of Usher&quot; typifies the continuing ambiguities of B picture classification. It was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But it is generally seen as a B movie: the schedule was still a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000 (one tenth the industry average), and its 85-minute running time close to an old thumbnail definition of the B: &quot;Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes.&quot;

With the loosening of industry censorship constraints, the 1960s saw a major expansion in the commercial viability of a variety of B movie subgenres that became known collectively as &quot;exploitation films&quot;. The combination of intensive and gimmick-laden publicity with movies featuring vulgar subject matter and often outrageous imagery dated back decades. The term had originally defined truly fringe productions, made at the lowest depths of Poverty Row or entirely outside the Hollywood system. Many graphically depicted the wages of sin in the context of promoting prudent lifestyle choices, particularly &quot;sexual hygiene&quot;. Audiences might see explicit footage of anything from a live birth to a ritual circumcision. Such films were not generally booked as part of movie theaters&#x27; regular schedules but rather presented as special events by traveling roadshow promoters (they might also appear as fodder for &quot;grindhouses&quot;, which typically had no regular schedule at all). The most famous of those promoters, Kroger Babb, was in the vanguard of marketing low-budget, sensationalistic films with a &quot;100% saturation campaign&quot;, inundating the target audience with ads in almost any imaginable medium. In the era of the traditional double feature, no one would have characterized these graphic exploitation films as &quot;B movies&quot;. With the majors having exited traditional B production and exploitation-style promotion becoming standard practice at the lower end of the industry, &quot;exploitation&quot; became a way to refer to the entire field of low-budget genre films. The 1960s saw exploitation-style themes and imagery become increasingly central to the realm of the B.
Exploitation movies in the original sense continued to appear: 1961&#x27;s &quot;Damaged Goods&quot;, a cautionary tale about a young lady whose boyfriend&#x27;s promiscuity leads to venereal disease, comes complete with enormous, grotesque closeups of VD&#x27;s physical effects. At the same time, the concept of fringe exploitation was merging with a related, similarly venerable tradition: &quot;nudie&quot; films featuring nudist-camp footage or striptease artists like Bettie Page had simply been the softcore pornography of previous decades. As far back as 1933, &quot;This Nude World&quot; was &quot;Guaranteed the Most Educational Film Ever Produced!&quot; In the late 1950s, as more of the old grindhouse theaters devoted themselves specifically to &quot;adult&quot; product, a few filmmakers began making nudies with greater attention to plot. Best known was Russ Meyer, who released his first successful narrative nudie, the comic &quot;Immoral Mr. Teas&quot;, in 1959. Five years later, Meyer came out with his breakthrough film, &quot;Lorna&quot;, which combined sex, violence, and a dramatic storyline. &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; (1965), made for about $45,000, ultimately became the most famous of Meyer&#x27;s sexploitation pictures. Crafted for constant titillation but containing no nudity, it was aimed at the same &quot;passion pit&quot; drive-in circuit that screened AIP teen movies with wink-wink titles like &quot;Beach Blanket Bingo&quot; (1965) and &quot;How to Stuff a Wild Bikini&quot; (1966), starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. Roger Corman&#x27;s &quot;The Trip&quot; (1967) for American International, written by veteran AIP/Corman actor Jack Nicholson, never shows a fully bared, unpainted breast, but flirts with nudity throughout. The Meyer and Corman lines were drawing closer.

One of the most influential films of the era, on Bs and beyond, was Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;. Its in earnings against a production cost of $800,000 made it the most profitable movie of 1960. Its mainstream distribution without the Production Code seal of approval helped weaken U.S. film censorship. And, as William Paul notes, this move into the horror genre by respected director Alfred Hitchcock was made, &quot;significantly, with the lowest-budgeted film of his American career and the least glamorous stars. [Its] greatest initial impact ... was on schlock horror movies (notably those from second-tier director William Castle), each of which tried to bill itself as scarier than &quot;Psycho&quot;.&quot; Castle&#x27;s first film in the &quot;Psycho&quot; vein was &quot;Homicidal&quot; (1961), an early step in the development of the slasher subgenre that took off in the late 1970s. &quot;Blood Feast&quot; (1963), a movie about human dismemberment and culinary preparation made for approximately $24,000 by experienced nudie-maker Herschell Gordon Lewis, established a new, more immediately successful subgenre, the gore or splatter film. Lewis&#x27;s business partner David F. Friedman drummed up publicity by distributing vomit bags to theatergoers, the sort of gimmick Castle had mastered, and arranging for an injunction against the film in Sarasota, Florida, the sort of problem exploitation films had long run up against, except Friedman had planned it. This new breed of gross-out movie typified the emerging sense of &quot;exploitation&quot;, the progressive adoption of traditional exploitation and nudie elements into horror, into other classic B genres, and into the low-budget film industry as a whole. Imports of Hammer Film&#x27;s increasingly explicit horror movies and Italian gialli, highly stylized pictures mixing sexploitation and ultraviolence, fueled this trend.

The Production Code was officially scrapped in 1968, to be replaced by the first version of the modern rating system. That year, two horror films came out that heralded directions American cinema would take in the next decade, with major consequences for the B movie. One was a high-budget Paramount production, directed by the celebrated Roman Polanski. Produced by B horror veteran William Castle, &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; was the first upscale Hollywood picture in the genre in three decades. It was a critical success and the year&#x27;s seventh-biggest hit. The other was George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, produced on weekends in and around Pittsburgh for $114,000. Building on the achievement of B genre predecessors like &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; in its subtextual exploration of social and political issues, it doubled as a highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for both the Vietnam War and domestic racial conflicts. Its greatest influence, though, derived from its clever subversion of genre clichés and the connection made between its exploitation-style imagery, low-cost, truly independent means of production, and high profitability. With the Code gone and the X rating established, major studio A films like &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; could now show &quot;adult&quot; imagery, while the market for increasingly hardcore pornography exploded. In this transformed commercial context, work like Russ Meyer&#x27;s gained a new legitimacy. In 1969, for the first time a Meyer film, &quot;Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers!&quot;, was reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Soon, Corman was creating nudity-filled sexploitation pictures such as &quot;Private Duty Nurses&quot; (1971) and &quot;Women in Cages&quot; (1971).

In May 1969, the most important exploitation movie of the era premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Much of &quot;Easy Rider&quot;″s significance owes to the fact that it was produced for a respectable, if still modest, budget and released by a major studio. The project was first taken by one of its cocreators, Peter Fonda, to American International. Fonda had become AIP&#x27;s top star in the Corman-directed &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; (1966), a biker movie, and &quot;The Trip&quot;, as in taking LSD. The idea Fonda pitched combined those two proven themes. AIP was intrigued but balked at giving his collaborator, Dennis Hopper, also a studio alumnus, free directorial rein. Eventually they arranged a financing and distribution deal with Columbia, as two more graduates of the Corman/AIP exploitation mill joined the project: Jack Nicholson and cinematographer László Kovács. The film (which incorporated another favorite exploitation theme, the redneck menace, as well as a fair amount of nudity) was brought in at a cost of $501,000. It earned in rentals. In the words of historians Seth Cagin and Philip Dray, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; became &quot;the seminal film that provided the bridge between all the repressed tendencies represented by schlock/kitsch/hack since the dawn of Hollywood and the mainstream cinema of the seventies.&quot;

====1970s====
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new generation of low-budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci-fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s. Operations such as Roger Corman&#x27;s New World Pictures, Cannon Films, and New Line Cinema brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country. The major studios&#x27; top product was continuing to inflate in running time—in 1970, the ten biggest earners averaged 140.1 minutes. The Bs were keeping pace. In 1955, Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging 74.8 minutes. He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970, two for AIP and three for his own New World: the average length was 89.8 minutes. These films could turn a tidy profit. The first New World release, the biker movie &quot;Angels Die Hard&quot;, cost $117,000 to produce and took in more than at the box office.

The biggest studio in the low-budget field remained a leader in exploitation&#x27;s growth. In 1973, American International gave a shot to young director Brian De Palma. Reviewing &quot;Sisters&quot;, Pauline Kael observed that its &quot;limp technique doesn&#x27;t seem to matter to the people who want their gratuitous gore. ... [H]e can&#x27;t get two people talking in order to make a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938.&quot; Many examples of the blaxploitation genre, featuring stereotype-filled stories about African Americans and revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation&#x27;s biggest stars was Pam Grier, who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1970). Several New World pictures followed, including &quot;The Big Doll House&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Big Bird Cage&quot; (1972), both directed by Jack Hill. Hill also directed Grier&#x27;s best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: &quot;Coffy&quot; (1973) and &quot;Foxy Brown&quot; (1974).

Blaxploitation was the first exploitation genre in which the major studios were central. Indeed, the United Artists release &quot;Cotton Comes to Harlem&quot; (1970), directed by Ossie Davis, is seen as the first significant film of the type. But the movie that truly ignited the blaxploitation phenomenon was completely independent: &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; (1971) is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form: wildly experimental, borderline pornographic, and essentially a manifesto for an African American revolution. Melvin Van Peebles wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with a loan from Bill Cosby. Its distributor was small Cinemation Industries, then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; &quot;shockumentaries&quot; and the Swedish skin flick &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;, as well as for its one in-house production, &quot;The Man from O.R.G.Y.&quot; (1970). These sorts of films played in the &quot;grindhouses&quot; of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather venues for all manner of exploitation cinema. The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.
In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in 16 mm by first-time American director Barbara Loden won the international critics&#x27; prize at the Venice Film Festival. &quot;Wanda&quot; is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture. The crime-based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old-school B noir. The $115,000 production, for which Loden spent six years raising money, was praised by Vincent Canby for &quot;the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and ... purity of technique&quot;. Like Romero and Van Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary. The first three features directed by Larry Cohen, &quot;Bone&quot; (1972), &quot;Black Caesar&quot; (1973), and &quot;Hell Up in Harlem&quot; (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism. The gory horror film &quot;Deathdream&quot; (1974), directed by Bob Clark, is also an agonized protest of the war in Vietnam. Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential: &quot;Shivers&quot; (1975), &quot;Rabid&quot; (1977), &quot;The Brood&quot; (1979). An &quot;Easy Rider&quot; with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists&#x27; biker-themed &quot;Electra Glide in Blue&quot; (1973), directed by James William Guercio. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer thought little of it: &quot;Under different intentions, it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio.&quot;

In the early 1970s, the growing practice of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, with the goal of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters&#x27; &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.

Asian martial arts films began appearing as imports regularly during the 1970s. These &quot;kung fu&quot; films as they were often called, whatever martial art they featured, were popularized in the United States by the Hong Kong–produced movies of Bruce Lee and marketed to the same audience targeted by AIP and New World. Horror continued to attract young, independent American directors. As Roger Ebert explained in one 1974 review, &quot;Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they&#x27;re brought in at the right price. So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would-be filmmakers who can&#x27;t get more conventional projects off the ground.&quot; The movie under consideration was &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;. Made by Tobe Hooper for less than $300,000, it became one of the most influential horror films of the 1970s. John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), produced on a $320,000 budget, grossed over worldwide and effectively established the slasher flick as horror&#x27;s primary mode for the next decade. Just as Hooper had learned from Romero&#x27;s work, &quot;Halloween&quot;, in turn, largely followed the model of &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974), directed by &quot;Deathdream&quot;″s Bob Clark.

On television, the parallels between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. As production of TV movies expanded with the introduction of the &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot; in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as &quot;The Ordeal of Patty Hearst&quot;, which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened all the way back to the 1920s and such movies as &quot;Human Wreckage&quot; and &quot;When Love Grows Cold&quot;, FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Many 1970s TV films—such as &quot;The California Kid&quot; (1974), starring Martin Sheen—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. &quot;Nightmare in Badham County&quot; (1976) headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.

The reverberations of &quot;Easy Rider&quot; could be felt in such pictures, as well as in a host of theatrical exploitation films. But its greatest influence on the fate of the B movie was less direct—by 1973, the major studios were catching on to the commercial potential of genres once largely consigned to the bargain basement. &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; had been a big hit, but it had little in common with the exploitation style. Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;The Exorcist&quot; demonstrated that a heavily promoted horror film could be an absolute blockbuster: it was the biggest movie of the year and by far the highest-earning horror movie yet made. In William Paul&#x27;s description, it is also &quot;the film that really established gross-out as a mode of expression for mainstream cinema. ... [P]ast exploitation films managed to exploit their cruelties by virtue of their marginality. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; made cruelty respectable. By the end of the decade, the exploitation booking strategy of opening films simultaneously in hundreds to thousands of theaters became standard industry practice.&quot; Writer-director George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, a Universal production, did something similar. Described by Paul as &quot;essentially an American-International teenybopper pic with a lot more spit and polish&quot;, it was 1973&#x27;s third-biggest film and, likewise, by far the highest-earning teen-themed movie yet made. Even more historically significant movies with B themes and A-level financial backing followed in their wake.

===Decline===
====1980s====
Most of the B-movie production houses founded during the exploitation era collapsed or were subsumed by larger companies as the field&#x27;s financial situation changed in the early 1980s. Even a comparatively cheap, efficiently made genre picture intended for theatrical release began to cost millions of dollars, as the major movie studios steadily moved into the production of expensive genre movies, raising audience expectations for spectacular action sequences and realistic special effects. Intimations of the trend were evident as early as &quot;Airport&quot; (1970) and especially in the mega-schlock of &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972), &quot;Earthquake&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974). Their disaster plots and dialogue were B-grade at best; from an industry perspective, however, these were pictures firmly rooted in a tradition of star-stuffed extravaganzas. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; had demonstrated the drawing power of big-budget, effects-laden horror. But the tidal shift in the majors&#x27; focus owed largely to the enormous success of three films: Steven Spielberg&#x27;s creature feature &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975) and George Lucas&#x27;s space opera &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) had each, in turn, become the highest-grossing film in motion picture history. &quot;Superman&quot;, released in December 1978, had proved that a studio could spend on a movie about a children&#x27;s comic book character and turn a big profit—it was the top box-office hit of 1978. Blockbuster fantasy spectacles like the original 1933 &quot;King Kong&quot; had once been exceptional; in the new Hollywood, increasingly under the sway of multi-industrial conglomerates, they ruled.

It had taken a decade and a half, from 1961 to 1976, for the production cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25%). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking continued to soar. With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit. Double features were now literally history—almost impossible to find except at revival houses. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists, which declared bankruptcy in April 1979. In the late 1970s, AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful &quot;Amityville Horror&quot; and the disastrous &quot;Meteor&quot; in 1979. The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern by the end of 1980.

Despite the mounting financial pressures, distribution obstacles, and overall risk, many genre movies from small studios and independent filmmakers were still reaching theaters. Horror was the strongest low-budget genre of the time, particularly in the slasher mode as with &quot;The Slumber Party Massacre&quot; (1982), written by feminist author Rita Mae Brown. The film was produced for New World on a budget of $250,000. At the beginning of 1983, Corman sold New World; New Horizons, later Concorde–New Horizons, became his primary company. In 1984, New Horizons released a critically applauded movie set amid the punk scene written and directed by Penelope Spheeris. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review concluded: &quot;&quot;Suburbia&quot; is a good genre film.&quot;

Larry Cohen continued to twist genre conventions in pictures such as &quot;Q&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Q: The Winged Serpent&quot;; 1982), described by critic Chris Petit as &quot;the kind of movie that used to be indispensable to the market: an imaginative, popular, low-budget picture that makes the most of its limited resources, and in which people get on with the job instead of standing around talking about it&quot;. In 1981, New Line put out &quot;Polyester&quot;, a John Waters movie with a small budget and an old-school exploitation gimmick: Odorama. That October &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot;, a gore-filled yet stylish horror movie made for less than $400,000, debuted in Detroit. Its writer, director, and co-executive producer, Sam Raimi, was a week shy of his twenty-second birthday; star and co-executive producer Bruce Campbell was twenty-three. It was picked up for distribution by New Line, retitled &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;, and became a hit. In the words of one newspaper critic, it was a &quot;shoestring &quot;tour de force&quot;&quot;.

One of the most successful 1980s B studios was a survivor from the heyday of the exploitation era, Troma Pictures, founded in 1974. Troma&#x27;s most characteristic productions, including &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High&quot; (1986), &quot;Redneck Zombies&quot; (1986), and &quot;Surf Nazis Must Die&quot; (1987), take exploitation for an absurdist spin. Troma&#x27;s best-known production is &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; (1984); its hideous hero, affectionately known as Toxie, was featured in three sequels, a 2023 reboot and a TV cartoon series. One of the few successful B studio startups of the decade was Rome-based Empire Pictures, whose first production, &quot;Ghoulies&quot;, reached theaters in 1985. The video rental market was becoming central to B film economics: Empire&#x27;s financial model relied on seeing a profit not from theatrical rentals, but only later, at the video store. A number of Concorde–New Horizon releases went this route as well, appearing only briefly in theaters, if at all. The growth of the cable television industry also helped support the low-budget film industry, as many B movies quickly wound up as &quot;filler&quot; material for 24-hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose.

====1990s====
By 1990, the cost of the average U.S. film had passed . Of the nine films released that year to gross more than at the U.S. box office, two would have been strictly B-movie material before the late 1970s: &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. Three more—the science-fiction thriller &quot;Total Recall&quot;, the action-filled detective thriller &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, and the year&#x27;s biggest hit, the slapstick kiddie comedy &quot;Home Alone&quot;—were also far closer to the traditional arena of the Bs than to classic A-list subject matter. The growing popularity of home video and access to unedited movies on cable and satellite television along with real estate pressures were making survival more difficult for the sort of small or non-chain theaters that were the primary home of independently produced genre films. Drive-in screens too were rapidly disappearing from the American landscape.

Surviving B movie operations adapted in different ways. Releases from Troma now frequently went straight to video. New Line, in its first decade, had been almost exclusively a distributor of low-budget independent and foreign genre pictures. With the smash success of exploitation veteran Wes Craven&#x27;s original &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984), whose nearly cost it had directly backed, the company began moving steadily into higher-budget genre productions. In 1994, New Line was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System; it was soon being run as a midsized studio with a broad range of product alongside Warner Bros. within the Time Warner conglomerate. The following year, Showtime launched &quot;Roger Corman Presents&quot;, a series of thirteen straight-to-cable movies produced by Concorde–New Horizons. A &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer found that the initial installment qualified as &quot;vintage Corman ... spiked with everything from bared female breasts to a mind-blowing quote from Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;Death in Venice&quot;&quot;.

At the same time as exhibition venues for B films vanished, the independent film movement was burgeoning; among the results were various crossovers between the low-budget genre movie and the &quot;sophisticated&quot; arthouse picture. Director Abel Ferrara, who built a reputation with violent B movies such as &quot;The Driller Killer&quot; (1979) and &quot;Ms. 45&quot; (1981), made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation-worthy depictions of sex, drugs, and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption: &quot;King of New York&quot; (1990) was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; (1992), , was financed totally independently. Larry Fessenden&#x27;s micro-budget monster movies, such as &quot;No Telling&quot; (1991) and &quot;Habit&quot; (1997), reframe classic genre subjects—Frankenstein and vampirism, respectively—to explore issues of contemporary relevance. The budget of David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;Crash&quot; (1996), , was not comfortably A-grade, but it was hardly B-level either. The film&#x27;s imagery was another matter: &quot;On its scandalizing surface, David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;Crash&quot; suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick&quot;, wrote critic Janet Maslin. Financed, like &quot;King of New York&quot;, by a consortium of production companies, it was picked up for U.S. distribution by Fine Line Features. This result mirrored the film&#x27;s scrambling of definitions: Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line, recently merged into the Time Warner empire—specifically, it was the old exploitation distributor&#x27;s arthouse division. &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), directed by Quentin Tarantino on an budget, became a hugely influential hit by crossing multiple lines, as James Mottram describes: &quot;With its art house narrative structure, B-movie subject matter and Hollywood cast, the film is the axis for three distinct cinematic traditions to intersect.&quot;

===Transition in the 2000s and after===

By the turn of the millennium, the average production cost of an American feature had already spent three years above the mark. In 2005, the top ten movies at the U.S. box office included three adaptations of children&#x27;s fantasy novels, one extending and another initiating a series (&quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, respectively), a child-targeted cartoon (&quot;Madagascar&quot;), a comic book adaptation (&quot;Batman Begins&quot;), a sci-fi series installment (&quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;), a sci-fi remake (&quot;War of the Worlds&quot;), and a &quot;King Kong&quot; remake. It was a slow year for Corman: he produced just one movie, which had no American theatrical release, true of most of the pictures he had been involved in over the preceding decade. As big-budget Hollywood movies further usurped traditional low-rent genres, the ongoing viability of the familiar brand of B movie was in grave doubt. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic A. O. Scott warned of the impending &quot;extinction&quot; of &quot;the cheesy, campy, guilty pleasures&quot; of the B picture.

On the other hand, recent industry trends suggest the reemergence of something like the traditional A-B split in major studio production, though with fewer &quot;programmers&quot; bridging the gap. According to a 2006 report by industry analyst Alfonso Marone, &quot;The average budget for a Hollywood movie is currently around $, rising to $ when the cost of marketing for domestic launch (USA only) is factored into the equation. However, we are now witnessing a polarisation of film budgets into two tiers: large productions ($120–) and niche features ($5–20m). Fewer $30– releases are expected.&quot; Fox launched a new subsidiary in 2006, Fox Atomic, to concentrate on teen-oriented genre films. The economic model was deliberately low-rent, at least by major studio standards. According to a &quot;Variety&quot; report, &quot;Fox Atomic is staying at or below the mark for many of its movies. It&#x27;s also encouraging filmmakers to shoot digitally, a cheaper process that results in a grittier, teen-friendly look. And forget about stars. Of Atomic&#x27;s nine announced films, not one has a big name&quot;. The newfangled B movie division was shut down in 2009.

As the &quot;Variety&quot; report suggests, recent technological advances greatly facilitate the production of truly low-budget motion pictures. Although there have always been economical means with which to shoot movies, including Super 8 and 16 mm film, as well as video cameras recording onto analog videotape, these media could not rival the image quality of 35 mm film. The development of digital cameras and post-production methods now allow even low-budget filmmakers to produce films with excellent, and not necessarily &quot;grittier&quot;, image quality and editing effects. As Marone observes, &quot;the equipment budget (camera, support) required for shooting digital is approximately 1/10 that for film, significantly lowering the production budget for independent features. At the same time, [since the early 2000s], the quality of digital filmmaking has improved dramatically.&quot; Independent filmmakers, whether working in a genre or arthouse mode, continue to find it difficult to gain access to distribution channels, though digital end-to-end methods of distribution offer new opportunities. In a similar way, Internet sites such as YouTube have opened up entirely new avenues for the presentation of low-budget motion pictures.

Likewise, from the year 2000 onward, the acceleration and implementation of computer generated imagery continued at an unprecedented rate. This lent to the creation of effects that would otherwise prove too costly using traditional methods. Certain genres in particular, such as disaster or creature features, saw increasing use of CGI. Consequently, this trend spurred a boost in B-grade productions targeted to a mass audience. In this vein, film companies, such as The Asylum, or channels, such as Syfy, made a concerted effort towards the development of B-grade movies with some even making such films a key part of their business model. Often, however, many of such were produced in an effort to capitalize on the success of more established features. Moreover, this new direction likewise garnered involvement from veteran B-movie filmmakers such as Roger Corman and Jim Wynorski.

==Associated terms==
The terms &quot;C movie&quot; and the more common &quot;Z movie&quot; describe progressively lower grades of the B movie category. The terms &quot;drive-in movie&quot; and &quot;midnight movie&quot;, which emerged in association with specific historical phenomena, are now often used as synonyms for &quot;B movie&quot;.

===C movie===
The C movie is the grade of motion picture at the low end of the B movie, or in some taxonomies, simply below it. In the 1980s, with the growth of cable television, the C grade began to be applied with increasing frequency to low-quality genre films used as filler programming for that market. The &quot;C&quot; in the term then does double duty, referring not only to quality that is lower than &quot;B&quot; but also to the initial &quot;c&quot; of &quot;cable.&quot; Helping to popularize the notion of the C movie was the TV series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (1988–99), which ran on national cable channels (first Comedy Central, then the Sci Fi Channel) after its first year. Updating a concept introduced by TV hostess Vampira over three decades before, &quot;MST3K&quot; presented cheap, low-grade movies, primarily science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s, along with running voiceover commentary highlighting the films&#x27; shortcomings. Director Ed Wood has been called &quot;the master of the &#x27;C-movie in this sense, although &quot;Z movie&quot; (see below) is perhaps even more applicable to his work. The rapid expansion of niche cable and satellite outlets such as Sci Fi (with its Sci Fi Pictures) and HBO&#x27;s genre channels in the 1990s and 2000s has meant a market for contemporary C pictures, many of them &quot;direct to cable&quot; movies—small-budget genre films never released in theaters.

===Z movie===
The term Z movie (or grade-Z movie) is used by some to characterize low-budget pictures with quality standards well below those of most B and even C movies. Most films referred to as Z movies are made on very small budgets by operations on the fringes of the commercial film industry. The micro-budget &quot;quickies&quot; of 1930s fly-by-night Poverty Row production houses may be thought of as early Z movies. The films of director Ed Wood, such as &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; (1953) and &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; (1957), the latter frequently cited as one of the worst pictures ever made, exemplify the classic grade-Z movie. Latter-day Zs are often characterized by violent, gory or sexual content and a minimum of artistic interest; they are often destined for the subscription TV equivalent of the grindhouse.

===Psychotronic movie===
Psychotronic movie is a term coined by film critic Michael J. Weldon—referred to by a fellow critic as &quot;the historian of marginal movies&quot;—to denote the sort of low-budget genre pictures that are generally disdained or ignored entirely by the critical establishment. Weldon&#x27;s immediate source for the term was the Chicago cult film &quot;The Psychotronic Man&quot; (1980), whose title character is a barber who develops the ability to kill using psychic energy. According to Weldon, &quot;My original idea with that word is that it&#x27;s a two-part word. &#x27;Psycho&#x27; stands for the horror movies, and &#x27;tronic&#x27; stands for the science fiction movies. It very quickly expanded the meaning of the word to include any kind of exploitation or B-movie.&quot; The term, popularized beginning in the 1980s with publications of Weldon&#x27;s such as &quot;The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film&quot;, &quot;The Psychotronic Video Guide&quot;, and &quot;Psychotronic Video&quot; magazine, has subsequently been adopted by other critics and fans. Use of the term tends to emphasize a focus on and affection for those B movies that lend themselves to appreciation as camp.

===B-television===

B-television is the term used by the German media scholar Heidemarie Schumacher in her article &quot;From the True, the Good, the Beautiful to the Truly Beautiful Goods—audience identification strategies on German &#x27;B-Television&#x27; programs&quot; as an analogy to &quot;B-movie&quot; to characterize the development of German commercial television, which adopted &quot;the aesthetics of commercials&quot; with its &quot;inane positiveness radiated by every participant, the inclusion of clips, soft focus, catchy music&quot; as well as &quot;promotion of merchandise through product placement&quot;. Schumacher notes that after 1984 deregulation German public television passed its climax and became marginalized. Newly established commercial stations, operating without the burden of societal legitimacy, focused solely on profitability. To establish and maintain viewer loyalty, these stations broadcast reality shows, sensational journalism, daily soap operas, infotainment programs, talk shows, game shows and soft pornography. In his article Schumacher mentions &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death&quot; by an American cultural critic Neil Postman, who formulated the thesis of television programming as a derivative of advertising, creating &quot;a species of information that might properly be called disinformation—misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing&quot;.

Like Postman, Schumacher notes that contemporary television advertisement often chooses to reinforce brand loyalty rather than promoting product. This reverse marketing approach is used by television broadcasters to advertise the stations themselves. Schumacher lists three specific principles: grabbing the viewers&#x27; attention, establishing emotional involvement with the audience, and maintaining the viewers&#x27; interest as the cornerstones to acquiring and maintaining market share. A commercial RTL station described such a building of viewers&#x27; loyalty in positive terms: &quot;RTL has discovered something entirely new for television. The viewer&quot;.

Schumacher argues that viewer loyalty is established primarily through the representation of familiar emotional situations and the everyday problems of the viewers, which means that private stations broadcast predominantly private affairs. Further development of this approach led to creation of reality TV shows, which generate new realities by intervening directly in the actual life of its participants. Such personalisation and dramatization of television precipitated the &quot;Fall of Public Man&quot;, in words of Richard Sennett.

The strategy of creating viewer loyalty through emotional sensations is reflected in scandalous &quot;special news&quot; that &quot;favor sex and crime topics and employ highly affective commentary style, a clip aesthetic as well as a musical accompaniment borrowed from the crime film genre&quot;. As an example, Schumacher mentions &quot;Real Personal&quot;, a talk show about human sexuality that was televised by NBC five times a week during 1990s. &quot;The title itself encapsulates the message of &#x27;B-TV&#x27;: real people and their &#x27;real&#x27; problems are the focus here&quot;, contemplates Schumacher.

Mentioning the highly successful entertainment programs of David Letterman and Jay Leno, Schumacher proclaims that a talk show host, seen daily on the television screen, becomes almost a part of the family. &quot;Spreading not only inanity, but also a sense of security&quot;, the host &quot;provides a fixed portion of our daily routine&quot; along with a daily soap opera, daily infotainment show or a daily game show.

&quot;Appeals to viewer emotions and the active participation of the consumer enhance the ability of &#x27;B-TV&#x27; to exploit the market&quot;, concludes Schumacher.

Erik Henriksen from &quot;Portland Mercury&quot; used the term &quot;B-TV&quot; when he reviewed &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; television series to describe the kind of show that is not &quot;genuinely great&quot;, but one that &quot;just works—albeit in a vaguely embarrassing and silly way—at entertaining the audience, at stringing along the same characters from week to week, at churning out boilerplate plots that are nonetheless peppered with just enough originality and uniqueness to make them enjoyable and fun and distracting.&quot;

<doc id="105392" wikidata="Q1052968" url="?curid=105392" title="Squeeze play (baseball)">
<text>In baseball, the squeeze play or a squeeze bunt is a maneuver consisting of a sacrifice bunt with a runner on third base. The batter bunts the ball, expecting to be thrown out at first base, but providing the runner on third base an opportunity to score. Such a bunt is most common with one out. According to Baseball Almanac, the squeeze play was invented in 1894 by George Case and Dutch Carter during a college game at Yale University.

In a safety squeeze, the runner at third takes a lead, but does not run towards home plate until the batter makes contact bunting. A play at home plate is possible. 

In a suicide squeeze, the runner takes off as soon as the pitcher begins the windup to throw the pitch, and before releasing the ball. If properly executed, and the batter bunts the ball nearly anywhere in fair territory on the ground, a play at home plate is extremely unlikely. However, if the batter misses the ball the runner will likely be tagged out, and if the batter pops the ball up a double play is likely.

These plays are often used in the late innings of a close game to score a tying, winning, or insurance run. A pitcher&#x27;s typical defense against a squeeze play, if he sees the batter getting into position to attempt a bunt, is to throw a high pitch that is difficult to bunt on the ground.

<text>Girlfriend From Hell is a 1989 American comedy horror film that was written and directed by Daniel M. Peterson. The film had its world premiere on April 24, 1989 at the Houston Film Festival and was released to video in August of the following year. It starred Dana Ashbrook and Liane Curtis, and follows a young high school girl who is possessed by the Devil in order to steal souls.

==Plot==
Maggie (Liane Curtis) is a shy woman that isn&#x27;t very good with men. This changes after she is possessed by Satan, who uses Maggie&#x27;s body to seduce the souls out of men. Enter Chaser (Dana Ashbrook) a bounty hunter seeking redemption by pursuing Satan and working off his sins for a shot at escaping purgatory.

==Reception==
Initial critical reception was poor and &quot;Allmovie&quot; rated it at two stars.

Screened as part of their 25th Anniversary Project, Paul Freitag-Fey of &quot;Daily Grindhouse&quot; wrote it was &quot;the type of film that sets up a mythology for the sake of a few jokes and then doesn&#x27;t give a shit about it&quot;. IE: &quot;The gun-toting nuns have nothing to do with the plot, mind you, and they have no idea they’re shooting at Satan – the filmmakers just wanted to make a joke about gun-toting nuns.&quot; They felt the viewer would do well to not concentrate on the plot, as the film was intended to be gag-based &quot;goofy, light-hearted exploitation comedy&quot; that did not take itself seriously.

In &quot;Creature Features: The Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Movie Guide&quot;, author John Stanley praised the film, writing that it was &quot;a supernatural/sci-fi spoof so dumb that it&#x27;s fun to watch thanks to good performances by an appealing cast.&quot;

===Stage musical===
In 2011 playwright/composer Sean Matthew Whiteford adapted &quot;Girlfriend from Hell&quot; into a stage musical. The transformative musical features 20 songs and a much revamped storyline. It premiered at the Gene Frankel Theatre in the East Village in 2011. In April 2015, a concert version of the musical was presented at 54 Below, Broadway&#x27;s Supper Club in NYC, following an evening of Patti LuPone. On August 1, 2015, another concert version was presented at The Cutting Room in NYC. A studio cast recording was made in Winter 2016 featuring Justin Matthew Sargent, Josephine Rose Roberts &amp; Neka Zang. In 2019, Deb Miller of DC Metro Theatre Arts raved that “Whiteford’s hilarious high school horror show has the makings of a rock musical cult classic.” A website for the musical, girlfriendfromhellmusical.com was launched in 2020.

<doc id="105397" wikidata="Q615551" url="?curid=105397" title="The Toxic Avenger (1984 film)">
<text>The Toxic Avenger is a 1984 American superhero comedy splatter film produced and directed by Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman (the latter credited as Samuel Weil for directing) from a screenplay by Joe Ritter, based on a story by Kaufman. The film was produced and released by Troma Entertainment. It is the first installment in &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; film series and generated a media franchise.

==Plot==
Melvin Ferd Junko III is a 98-pound janitor at a health club in the fictional town of Tromaville, New Jersey, where the customers Bozo, Slug, Wanda and Julie regularly harass and bully him. They trick Melvin into wearing a pink tutu and hugging a sheep. He is ridiculed and chased around the health club and out a second-story window. He falls into a drum of toxic waste, which transforms him into a hideously deformed mutant with superhuman size and strength.

A group of drug dealers, led by Cigar Face, are trying to bribe a police officer. When he refuses to accept the money, Cigar Face and his gang prepare to castrate him. Melvin appears and kills the criminals, and leaves a mop on their faces as a calling card. Cigar Face escapes, promising to take revenge. When Melvin returns home, his mother is terrified of him and will not let him in the house, so he builds a makeshift home in the local junkyard.

A gang of three men hold up a Mexican restaurant and attack a blind woman, named Sara. They kill her guide dog and attempt to rape her, but are stopped by Melvin. Melvin takes Sara back to her home, where they get to know one another and become romantically involved.

Melvin continues to fight crime, including drug dealers and pimps for underage prostitutes. As Melvin gives aid to the people in the city and is celebrated as a hero, Mayor Belgoody, the leader of Tromaville&#x27;s extensive crime ring, fears having the truth exposed. He wants Melvin gone. A group of men, led by Cigar Face, surround Melvin with guns. Just before they fire on him, he leaps up to a fire escape so they shoot each other instead.

Melvin takes revenge on the four bullies who caused his transformation. He first attacks Wanda in the health club&#x27;s sauna and burns her backside on the heater. He returns to the club later, pursues Julie into the basement, and cuts off her hair. He confronts Bozo and Slug after they steal a car. They attempt to run Melvin down, but he leaps onto the roof and throws Slug out of the moving car. Melvin then gets in and pulls off the steering wheel, causing Bozo to drive off the side of a cliff. The car explodes, killing Bozo.

When Melvin kills a seemingly innocent old woman in a dry cleaning store (in fact a leader of a human trafficking ring), Belgoody calls in the United States National Guard. Melvin is horrified at what he has become. He and Sara move away from the city and into the nearby woods. They are eventually discovered, and the Mayor and the National Guard come to kill him. However, the people of Tromaville step in, and Melvin&#x27;s mother identifies the mutant as her son. The Mayor&#x27;s evil ways are revealed, and Melvin rips out Belgoody&#x27;s organs to see if he has &quot;any guts.&quot; Hailed as a hero, Melvin continues to combat crime in Tromaville.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; was the film that established Troma&#x27;s formula and following. Previously the production company focused on sex comedies such as &quot;Cry Uncle!&quot; and &quot;Squeeze Play!&quot;. Subsequently, Troma focused almost exclusively on horror films.

In 1975, Lloyd Kaufman had the idea to shoot a horror film involving a health club while serving as the pre-production supervisor on the set of &quot;Rocky&quot;. Years later at the Cannes Film Festival, Kaufman read an article that stated monster movies were no longer popular, so he decided to produce his own take on one based on his idea. It was given the original working title of &quot;Health Club Horror,&quot; and eventually retitled.

===Filming===
Principal photography for &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; took place at various locations in New Jersey, with most of it shot in and around Boonton. The car chase scene, which ends with a car driving off a cliff and exploding, was filmed in Jersey City. The scene was inspired by the final truck scene in George Miller&#x27;s film &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;. Filming was completed in 1983.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
Troma Entertainment released &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; initially in 1984, receiving an early review from Variety in late December. During the next year, the film had a long run as the midnight movie on the single screen of the Bleeker Street Cinema in New York City. On April 4, 1986, the film opened on 45 screens and earned $140,000 for its opening weekend.

===Home media===
&quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; was released by Troma on VHS and Betamax in 1986, and for the first time on DVD on March 25, 1998. It was re-released by Troma on November 20, 2000 and again on September 3, 2002, as part of a 4-disk Toxic Avenger movie pack. The film was picked up for distribution by Prism, who released the film on DVD on February 2, 2004. Troma then released its own 21st Anniversary Edition version of the film on March 29, 2005. On March 7, 2006, the film was released again on DVD by Koch Entertainment. The film would not receive another home media release until Troma released a &quot;Japanese Cut&quot; of the film on December 11, 2012. Troma released the film for the first time on Blu-ray on August 12, 2014. On November 18 that year, it was again released on Blu-ray by Import Vendor.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; holds an approval rating of 70%, based on 20 reviews, and an average rating of 5.5/10. Its consensus reads, &quot;A silly and ribald superhero spoof, &quot;Toxic Avenger&#x27;s&quot; uninhibited humor hits more than it misses.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, calling the film, &quot;A funny spoof... Not without violence and gore but still entertaining.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; rated the film a score of 3/5, complimenting the film for its &quot;maniacally farcical sense of humor&quot;, while also noting that the film itself was &quot;trash.&quot;

TV Guide gave the film a negative 1/5 stars, writing &quot;Though it is silly, sleazy, and graphically violent, &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; does hold a bit of warped charm for fans of this sort of thing.&quot; Keith Phipps from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; was highly critical of the film, writing, &quot;As for the movie itself, it&#x27;s still a piece of trash, if a marginally entertaining one: it&#x27;s too self-consciously parodic to be good kitsch, and too gross to be all that fun.&quot; In his book &quot;Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008&quot;, Bruce G. Hallenbeck described the film as &quot;disgusting, sick, vile, poorly acted and sloppily produced.&quot; He challenged the interpretation of the film as a parody, arguing that the mean-spirited tone of its extreme gore and offensiveness makes clear that the filmmakers were simply trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator.

==Reboot==
In 2010 a remake of &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; was announced, set to be co-written and directed by Steve Pink. In 2016 &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Conrad Vernon will direct the film, while Mike Arnold and Chris Poole were attached to rewrite the screenplay by Pink and Daniel C. Mitchell. In 2018 Legendary Pictures won the rights to reboot &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot;, with the original&#x27;s directors–producers, Kaufman and Herz, returning as producers. In 2019 Macon Blair was announced to write and direct the upcoming film.

In November 2020 it was announced that Peter Dinklage would star in the film. In April 2021 Jacob Tremblay and Taylour Paige were added to the cast. In June 2021, Kevin Bacon, Julia Davis, and Elijah Wood joined the cast. That month principal photography commenced in Bulgaria and wrapped on August.

The &quot;Toxic Avenger&quot; remake premiered as the opening film of Fantastic Fest on September 21, 2023, and will be theatrically release by Cineverse in the United States for 2025.

<text>Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High (also known as Atomic High School) is a 1986 American science-fiction horror comedy film produced and distributed by Troma Entertainment. Directed by Richard W. Haines and Lloyd Kaufman (the latter under the pseudonym &quot;Samuel Weil&quot;), the film follows a high school impacted by radioactive drugs obtained from a nearby nuclear power plant.

New York holographer Jason Sapan created the laser effects.

==Plot==
Tromaville High School in New Jersey is located next to a nuclear power plant. A nuclear accident at the power plant is covered up by plant owner, Mr. Paley, who does not want the facility shut down by the safety commission. The accident causes a radioactive water leak which ends up gruesomely killing a student named Dewey. at the school after the tainted water reaches the drinking fountain. The gang of the school, called &quot;The Cretins,&quot; who were originally part of the honor society, torments the school, and it is implied that they have been turned into violent psychopaths by the runoff from the plant. They pick leaves from a radioactive marijuana plant located in the yard of the nuclear plant and sell it to Eddie for $10.

At his &quot;indoor bikini beach party&quot; that night, Eddie pressures his friend Warren and Warren&#x27;s girlfriend Chrissy into smoking the radioactive joint, but it accidentally falls on the floor and is trampled by other party-goers before anyone else can try it. The mutated drug shows itself to have potent aphrodisiac effects, leading to Warren and Chrissy having sex in Eddie&#x27;s loft. However, that same night, both of them have disturbing nightmares about hideously mutating, with Warren&#x27;s penis and chrissy&#x27;s stomach growing. though these effects are seemingly gone by morning.

Some time later, Chrissy discovers that she is pregnant, and spits out a small creature into a nearby toilet. The creature travels through the water pipes and lands in a barrel filled with radioactive waste. There it mutates into a bigger creature. The nuclear Plant orders a lock down of the school, and begins an investigation into Dewey&#x27;s death. One of the nuclear workers begins to investigate the basement. Though his equipment shows signs of a spill, he can&#x27;t find any evidence, outside of a foul odor. After hearing for a second time a sound which he had previously dismissed, he investigates. As he is observing a barrel, the monster&#x27;s arm reaches out and claws his face before killing him.

Meanwhile, Warren, tired of the Cretins&#x27; constant harassment, ends up going on a radiation-fueled rampage, killing two of them, with no memory of the event once he comes to his senses. The Cretins, expelled from the school and cut off from their customer base, assault the principal and force him to use the school&#x27;s Radiation Alarm to cause an evacuation, letting the Cretins bar the building and occupy it. In the process of doing this, the Cretins shoot and kill the principal&#x27;s secretary, who happened to open the door just as the gang was torturing the principal. Capturing Chrissy as bait for Warren, the leader of the gang holds her hostage in the basement and plans to kill her in front of Warren, only to be interrupted by the now adult monster.

Warren goes into the school to save her and discovers the adult monster, who kills every one of the Cretins. Warren zaps the creature with a laser from the physics laboratory as he and Chrissy flee the school. Mr. Paley enters the room before the school explodes, killing him and the creature. The students celebrate as the loudspeakers announce that the school will be shut down for remodeling. While reconstruction is taking place, another small creature appears squirming through the remains of the destroyed school.

==Music==
The soundtrack to the film remained unreleased until 2014, when Troma licensed its release on the Ship to Shore PhonoCo. label. The album was released in physical form exclusively on LP record as a limited pressing of 1,300 copies, with 700 being black, 300 of a green-colored version known as &quot;Atomic High&quot;, and another 300 of a green/blue color known as &quot;Dewey&#x27;s Meltdown&quot;. Each copy included a card with a code that allowed for download of an expanded digital release that contained commentary on each song from Troma President and Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High co-director Lloyd Kaufman.

All songs from the soundtrack were featured in the film except two tracks. &quot;We Are One&quot; by Ethan &amp; the Coup who had previously written the song for the movie in 1986, but missed the deadline for submission for the film to be included. The theme to &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High 2: Subhumanoid Meltdown&quot; was only heard on the film&#x27;s sequel.

==Reception==
&quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High&quot; has received generally negative reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 20% based on 5 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. DVD Talk offers a more positive assessment of the film: &quot;&quot;Class Of Nuke &#x27;Em High&quot; isn&#x27;t a film to be taken too seriously, but rather enjoyed for what it is and that&#x27;s a crass, gory, trashy fun-filled eighty five minutes of Troma style high jinks. It plays off of different clichés and stereotypes really well and provides plenty of low-brow laughs and splattery set pieces.&quot; A review for &quot;Horror DNA&quot; praises various aspects of the film, including special effects and cinematography: &quot;The film is a testament to filmmakers with high ambitions and low budgets, as the production value is at times quite impressive. The miniatures used for the nuclear plant are effective and the visual f/x do not stick out as shoddy or overtly fake. There are some nice action sequences involving motorcycles and even some gun play that are tightly edited and help the film to zip along. Michael Mayers’ cinematography adds a layer of beauty to sequences that otherwise risk appearing cheap and jokey.&quot;

The film earned $1,900,000 at the US box office.

==Sequels==
The film spawned four sequels. Two came in the 1990s with 1991&#x27;s &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High 2: Subhumanoid Meltdown&quot; and 1994&#x27;s &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High 3: The Good, the Bad and the Subhumanoid&quot;. These two sequels were not directed by either Lloyd Kaufman or Michael Herz, but were produced by them. They were more comedic than violent and had good production values despite the low budget. The sequels marked the first appearance by Tromie the radioactive squirrel. Two sequels directed by Kaufman arrived in the 2010s. A fourth installment of the series called &quot;Return to Nuke &#x27;Em High Volume 1&quot; was released in January 2014. The fifth entry, &quot;Return to Return to Nuke &#x27;Em High AKA Volume 2&quot;, premiered at 2017 Cannes Film Festival.

==Potential remake==
In 2011, it was announced that Troma was in negotiations to sell the remake rights to &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High&quot;.

<text>A Buffalo wing in American cuisine is an unbreaded chicken wing section (flat or drumette) that is generally deep-fried, then coated or dipped in a sauce consisting of a vinegar-based cayenne pepper hot sauce and melted butter prior to serving. They are traditionally served hot, along with celery sticks and carrot sticks, and a dip of ranch dressing or blue cheese dressing (the latter being primarily served in New York). Buffalo wings are named after Buffalo, New York, where they were invented, and have no relation to the animal. They are often called simply chicken wings, hot wings, or just wings.

Buffalo wings have gained in popularity in the United States and abroad, with some North American restaurant chains featuring them as a main menu item. The name &quot;Buffalo&quot; is now also applied to other spiced fried foods served with dipping sauces, including boneless chicken wings (made from chicken breast meat rather than a chicken wing), chicken fries, chicken nuggets, popcorn chicken, shrimp, and cauliflower. It is also used for other dishes, such as pizza, that are seasoned with the Buffalo-style sauce or a seasoning.

==History==
===Origin===
There are several different claims about the invention of Buffalo wings. One is that Buffalo wings were first prepared in 1964 at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York, by Teressa Bellissimo, who owned the bar with her husband Frank. At the time, chicken wings were inexpensive and undesirable, and normally thrown away or reserved for stock or soup.

Several versions of the story of the invention have been circulated by the Bellissimo family and others, including:

*The Bellissimos&#x27; son, Dominic, was tending the bar, and upon the unannounced late-night arrival of several of his friends, Teressa wanted a fast and easy snack to present to the guests. She came up with the idea of deep frying chicken wings and tossing them in cayenne hot sauce.
*Dominic told &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reporter Calvin Trillin in 1980: &quot;It was Friday night in the bar and since people were buying a lot of drinks he wanted to do something nice for them at midnight when the mostly Catholic patrons would be able to eat meat again.&quot; He stated his mother came up with the idea of chicken wings.
*There was a mistaken delivery of wings instead of backs and necks for making the bar&#x27;s spaghetti sauce. Faced with this unexpected resource, Frank says that he asked Teressa to do something with them, resulting in the Buffalo wing.

Although an article published about the Anchor Bar in a local newspaper during 1969 does not mention Buffalo wings, a local competitor of the Anchor Bar, Duff&#x27;s, began selling Buffalo wings in that year.

Another claim is that John Young, who moved to Buffalo from Stockton, Alabama in 1948 at the age of 13, popularized chicken wings in Buffalo. Beginning in 1961, he began serving uncut chicken wings that were breaded, deep fried, and served in his own special tomato-based Mumbo sauce at his Buffalo restaurant. Prior to opening his restaurant, he had a conversation with a boxer who traveled; in a later interview Young recalled: &quot;He told me that there was a restaurant in Washington, D.C. that was doing a good business with wings and I decided to specialize.&quot; In the same interview Young stated that the Anchor Bar did not offer Buffalo wings as a regular menu item until 1974. He registered the name of his restaurant, John Young&#x27;s Wings &#x27;n Things, at the county courthouse before leaving the Buffalo area in 1970. In 2013, at the National Buffalo Wing Festival held in Buffalo, John Young&#x27;s contributions were acknowledged when he was inducted into the festival&#x27;s National Buffalo Wing Hall of Flame.

===Growth and popularity===
In 1977, the city of Buffalo issued an official proclamation celebrating Anchor Bar co-owner Frank Bellissimo and declared July 29, 1977, to be Chicken Wing Day. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Buffalo wings gained in popularity as a bar food and appetizer across the United States and nearby towns across the border in Canada. Large franchises specializing in Buffalo wings have emerged, notably Buffalo Wild Wings founded in 1982 and Hooters in 1983. McDonald&#x27;s began selling Mighty Wings as an option in 1990 at their restaurant locations in the United States. In 1994, following four Super Bowl appearances by the Buffalo Bills football team, the Domino&#x27;s pizza chain added Buffalo wings to their national menu, followed by Pizza Hut the next year.

As the market for chicken wings expanded, restaurants began to create and use a variety of sauces in addition to buffalo sauce. Some of these new chicken wing sauces were influenced by Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Caribbean, and Indian cuisines. Other flavors created by restaurants include unique combinations, such as Blueberry BBQ Wing Sauce and Maple/Bacon Glaze for example, to help keep customer interest and grow their businesses. After the price of raw wings increased, and with a growing desire by some diners for a neater eating experience, restaurants began to offer a menu item called &quot;boneless wings,&quot; sometimes marketed under the name wyngz. Boneless wings are essentially small pieces of skinless, boneless chicken breast that are coated in flour and spices, then fried or baked, like a chicken nugget. They are usually coated in or served with the same sauces as Buffalo wings. The growing popularity in recent years of Buffalo wing consumption, and of restaurants serving wings, have led to actual and perceived shortages of chicken wings in the United States during certain times.

In many areas of the United States, chicken wing festivals are held—with Buffalo wings being used in competitive eating events such as at Philadelphia&#x27;s Wing Bowl and the National Buffalo Wing Festival. It has also become commonplace for restaurants to offer a wing-eating contest. Many bars and restaurants intentionally create an extra-hot sauce for this purpose, and customers are sometimes rewarded with their picture posted on the restaurant&#x27;s wall or website, a commemorative T-shirt, a free meal or a combination of rewards for successfully completing the challenge.

==Preparation==
===Chicken===
The chicken wings used for Buffalo wings are usually segmented into three parts: drumette, flat, and flapper or pointer, the last of which is usually discarded, although some restaurants serve them with this latter part still connected to the flat. Traditionally, the wings are deep-fried in oil, without breading or flour until they are well browned. Alternatively, they may be baked, grilled, or broiled.

===Sauce===
Cayenne pepper-based hot sauce, melted butter, and vinegar are the standard base of Buffalo wing sauce, which may be made mild, medium, or hot. Other ingredients are also common, although less dominant, such as Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder. Commercial ready-to-use wing sauce is made with varying levels of spiciness. The cooked chicken wings are placed in a bowl or pot and shaken to coat the wings completely covering them in sauce before serving.

===Service===
Traditionally, Buffalo wings are served with small sticks of celery (accompanied sometimes with baby carrots or carrot sticks), and blue cheese dipping sauce on the side. Ranch dressing, however, is the most popular wing dipping sauce in the United States.

<doc id="105406" wikidata="Q1158741" url="?curid=105406" title="Tromeo and Juliet">
<text>Tromeo and Juliet is a 1996 American independent transgressive romantic black comedy film and a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; from Troma Entertainment. The film was directed by Lloyd Kaufman from a screenplay by Kaufman and James Gunn, who also served as associate director.

The film is a loose adaptation of the play, as it includes the extreme amounts of sexuality and violence characteristic of Troma, as well as a revised ending. The film&#x27;s title is a blend of &quot;Troma&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

==Plot==

Set in modern-day Manhattan, the film begins with the narrator (Lemmy of Motörhead) introducing two families: the rich Capulets and the poor Ques.

At the center of these families are Tromeo Que and Juliet Capulet. Tromeo lives in squalor with his poor father Monty and works at a tattoo parlor with his cousin Benny and friend Murray. Juliet is sequestered in her family&#x27;s mansion, watched over by her abusive father Cappy, passive mother Ingrid, and overprotective cousin Tyrone, all the while being sexually satisfied by family servant Ness (Debbie Rochon).

Both Tromeo and Juliet are trapped in cases of unrequited love: Tromeo lusts for the big-bosomed, promiscuous Rosie; Juliet is subjected into marrying wealthy meat tycoon London Arbuckle by her father who hopes of completing his mafia family tree.

In the meantime, an intense duel between Murray and Sammy Capulet catches the attention of Detective Ernie Scalus, who gathers the heads of the two families together and declares that they will be held personally accountable for any further breaches of the peace. Almost immediately afterward, Monty and Cappy start threatening each other with weapons. Sammy, on the other hand, gets caught in the window of Monty&#x27;s speeding car, where he is thrown head-first into a fire hydrant and gradually dies.

On the insistence of Murray and Benny, Tromeo attends the Capulets&#x27; masquerade ball in the hopes of meeting Rosie, only to find another man performing cunnilingus on her. Tromeo staggers around the party in disillusion until he locks eyes with Juliet. The two instantly fall for each other and share a dance until an angry Tyrone chases him out of the house.

Tromeo and Juliet continue to be enamored by one another from afar. Cappy, disgusted at his daughter&#x27;s active libido, forcefully imprisons her in a plastic cage as punishment. Eventually, Tromeo sneaks into the house of Capulet and the two meet once again. After proclaiming their love for each other both verbally and physically, they agree to be married. Juliet breaks her engagement with Arbuckle and, with the help of Father Lawrence, the two are married in secrecy the next day.

Tyrone, upon discovering Juliet&#x27;s secret affair, gathers his gang together to find Tromeo in his family&#x27;s parlor and accuse him of bridenapping. Now a kinsman to the Capulets, Tromeo reassures Tyrone that Juliet doesn&#x27;t want Arbuckle as her husband anymore hence announcing a truce to both families. However, Tyrone refuses to believe him. Eventually, Murray stands by Tromeo&#x27;s side to try and defend his honor but is fatally wounded by Tyrone&#x27;s club as an example for anyone, besides Arbuckle, who dares to seduce Juliet. Tromeo, enraged by his friend&#x27;s death, pursues Tyrone, slays him (through a series of car crashes that dismember him). As punishment for the murder of Tyrone in addition to ruining Arbuckle&#x27;s wedding with Juliet, Detective Scalus evicts the Ques from Manhattan to ensure that his sacrifice won&#x27;t be in vain on behalf of the Capulet family while Cappy savagely beats Juliet into reconciling with Arbuckle after learning from the late Tyrone that Juliet has already become Tromeo&#x27;s wife, threatening to disown her if she doesn&#x27;t. With the help of Cappy, Arbuckle accepts her re-proposal and the wedding date is set.

Eventually, Juliet goes into hiding with Father Lawrence, whom she recruited along with Tromeo, who was recently evicted from his home by Scalus along with the rest of his family. Together, the three devise a plan to clear the Que family name and end the Capulet/Que feud for good, enlisting the help of Fu Chang, the apothecary, who sells Juliet a special potion which will aid her predicament.

On the day of her wedding, Juliet drinks the apothecary&#x27;s potion, transforming her into a hideous cow monster (complete with a three-foot penis). The mere sight of her causes Arbuckle to leap out of Juliet&#x27;s window in fright, committing suicide in the process. Enraged over the loss of his would-be son-in-law and meat inheritance, Cappy deems Juliet a disgrace to the Capulet family and sentences her to death, but Tromeo arrives just in time to chase Cappy out of her room before he can rape her to death and bring Juliet&#x27;s appearance back to normal by a single kiss. Meanwhile, Cappy was forced to retreat into the parlor to get his crossbow, and then returns to Juliet&#x27;s room, ready to execute the newlyweds. Eventually, Juliet performs one last act of defiance against her father by electrocuting him to death with a computer monitor. After the Capulets&#x27; residence is successfully overtaken, Detective Scalus becomes impressed by Tromeo and Juliet&#x27;s teamwork of ending Cappy&#x27;s criminal empire, pardoning Tromeo of murder while ordering for Cappy&#x27;s corpse to be transported by an ambulance to the morgue for cremation.

With Cappy&#x27;s criminal empire finally defeated, Tromeo and Juliet embrace victoriously until they are stopped short by Ingrid and Monty, who reveals to them the real reason behind the Capulet/Que feud: Long ago, Cappy and Monty were the owners of the successful Silky Films production company. Ingrid, married to Monty at the time, struck up an affair with Cappy, eventually birthing a son which Monty raised as his own. Faced with a divorce from Ingrid and the threat of having his son taken away from him, Monty was forced to sign over all the rights of Silky Films to the Capulets in exchange for his son. After the initial shock at the revelation that they are siblings, Tromeo and Juliet brush it off as they are determined not to let their whole ordeal be for naught; they passionately embrace and drive off into the sunset.

The film picks up six years later in Tromaville, New Jersey, where Tromeo and Juliet, now married, have become suburban yuppies with a house and (birth defected/deformed) children of their own.

The film ends with the narrator&#x27;s brief poem for the lovers: &quot;And all of our hearts free to let all things base go/As taught by Juliet and her Tromeo&quot;. A brief shot of William Shakespeare laughing uproariously is shown before the end credits.

==Cast==

Lloyd Kaufman, Merle Allin and Ami James have non-speaking cameos in the film. A scene featuring Ron Jeremy as a homeless man was filmed but ultimately deleted from the final cut of the movie.

==Production==
The first draft of &quot;Tromeo &amp; Juliet&quot; surfaced in 1992, written by Kaufman and Troma employees Andy Deemer and Phil Rivo, written entirely in Shakespearean verse and supposedly featuring The Toxic Avenger as a side character. The feedback from other Troma employees and Michael Herz was unanimously negative, so the idea was scrapped.

In 1995, another shot was taken at the concept, this time by newbie screenwriter James Gunn. Gunn completely rewrote the script, again in Shakespearean verse, making it darker and far more obscene; the original version had Juliet as a stripper and Tromeo as a crack dealer. Another revision, with additional material by Kaufman, was crafted into what the film eventually became: the verse was trimmed down and more comical elements were added.

&quot;Tromeo and Juliet&quot; was shot in the summer of 1995 for $350,000, one of the most expensive films in Troma history.

Director Lloyd Kaufman said that, in preparation for their sex scene, he gave Will Keenan and Jane Jensen time during pre-production to block the scene themselves. &quot;I wanted them to develop a very intense relationship and indeed they did. But they decided that they shouldn&#x27;t actually have off-screen intercourse until after the movie. I don&#x27;t remember whether they ever did but this gave their on-screen scenes together terrific sexual tension and was something a sex-crazed pervert like me would never have thought of in a zillion years,&quot; Kaufman said.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Tromeo &amp; Juliet&quot; had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 13, 1996. In addition, it played at the Mar del Plata Film Festival and the Italian Fantafestival, where it won the award for Best Film of 1997.

&quot;Tromeo&quot; screened at New York arthouse theaters on February 14, 1997. It expanded to select theaters in the United States on February 28, 1997.

==Reception==
In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden said &quot;&quot;Tromeo &amp; Juliet&quot; is to Hollywood B-movies what Mad magazine is to comic books. Although many times more explicit than what Hollywood is permitted to show, there is something goofily exhilarating in the spectacle of all the staple images of teen-age sex and slasher movies transformed into farce.&quot; In a review for Entertainment Weekly, J.R. Taylor gave the film a grade of B and wrote, &quot;While this comedy about star-crossed idiots (Jane Jensen and Will Keenan) has all the kinky sex and ultraviolence expected of the Troma studio, which built its reputation on chimichangas like The Toxic Avenger, Shakespeare’s dewy tragedy still glistens amid the deep-fried glop. Which is all the more incredible considering that Tromeo &amp; Juliet changes the Bard’s ending and throws out most of his words. Some stories just adapt more readily than others.&quot;

Daniel Rosenthal described &quot;Tromeo and Juliet&quot; as &quot;the nadir of screen Shakespeare...[it] takes every major character and incident from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and systematically drains them of humanity in a tedious, appallingly acted feast of mutilation and softcore sex.&quot; Tony Howard summarized it as a film &quot;in which Juliet and the Nurse have lesbian sex, Romeo masturbates, various body parts are removed, the feud is between rival porn czars and incest rules&quot;.

==Home media==
&quot;Tromeo &amp; Juliet&quot; was released on DVD as a 10th Anniversary Collector’s Addition on August 22, 2006.

==Attempted follow-ups==

After the success of &quot;Tromeo&quot;, Troma had plans to develop a spiritual sequel entitled &quot;Schlock and Schlockability&quot; (a play on &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;), in which Jane Austen is reincarnated as a well-endowed female who takes revenge on all of the Hollywood movie producers who have bastardized her novels. At one point, Troma announced that the film would head into production, but since then, there are no plans to follow up on the film.

==Soundtrack==
&quot;Tromeo and Juliet&quot; is also notable for its soundtrack, which is composed of alternative rock, pop punk and heavy metal music. The CD soundtrack was released on Oglio Records on May 5, 1997, and included the following tracks:

<text>Sir Roderick David Stewart (born 10 January 1945) is a British rock and pop singer and songwriter. Known for his distinctive raspy singing voice, Stewart is among the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 120 million records worldwide. His music career began in 1962 when he took up busking with a harmonica. In 1963, he joined the Dimensions as a harmonica player and vocalist. In 1964, Stewart joined Long John Baldry and the All Stars before moving to the Jeff Beck Group in 1967. Joining Faces in 1969, he also launched a solo career, releasing his debut album, &quot;An Old Raincoat Won&#x27;t Ever Let You Down&quot;, that year. Stewart&#x27;s early albums were a fusion of rock, folk music, soul music, and R&amp;B. His third album, 1971&#x27;s &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story&quot;, was his breakthrough, topping the charts in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, as did its ballad &quot;Maggie May&quot;. His 1972 follow-up album, &quot;Never a Dull Moment&quot;, also reached number one in the UK and Australia, while going top three in the US and Canada. Its single, &quot;You Wear It Well&quot;, topped the chart in the UK and was a moderate hit elsewhere.

After Stewart had a handful more UK top-ten hits, Faces broke up in 1975. Stewart&#x27;s next few hit singles were ballads, with &quot;Sailing&quot;, off the 1975 UK and Australian number-one album, &quot;Atlantic Crossing&quot;, becoming a hit in the UK and the Netherlands (number one), Germany (number four) and other countries, but barely charting in North America. &quot;A Night on the Town&quot; (1976), his fifth straight chart-topper in the UK, began a three-album run of going number one or top three in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia with each release. That album&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night (Gonna Be Alright)&quot; spent almost two months at number one in the US and Canada, and made the top five in other countries. &quot;Foot Loose &amp; Fancy Free&quot; (1977) contained the hit &quot;You&#x27;re in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)&quot; as well as the rocker &quot;Hot Legs&quot;. &quot;Blondes Have More Fun&quot; (1978) and its disco-tinged &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; both went to number one in Canada, Australia and the US, with &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; also hitting number one in the UK and the top ten in other countries. Stewart&#x27;s albums regularly hit the upper rungs of the charts in the Netherlands throughout the &#x27;70s and in Sweden from 1975 onward.
After a disco and new wave period in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stewart&#x27;s music turned to a soft rock/middle-of-the-road style, with most of his albums reaching the top ten in the UK, Germany and Sweden, but faring less well in the US. The single &quot;Rhythm of My Heart&quot; was a top five hit in the UK, US and other countries, with its source album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Vagabond Heart&quot;, becoming, at number ten in the US and number two in the UK, his highest-charting album in a decade. In 1993, he collaborated with Bryan Adams and Sting on the power ballad &quot;All for Love&quot;, which went to number one in many countries. In the early 2000s, he released a series of successful albums interpreting the Great American Songbook.

In 2008, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked Stewart the 17th most successful artist on the &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists&quot;. A Grammy and Brit Award recipient, he was voted at No. 33 in &quot;Q Magazine&quot;″s list of the Top 100 Greatest Singers of all time. As a solo artist, Stewart was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and he was inducted a second time into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Faces. He has had 10 number-one albums and 31 top-ten singles in the UK, six of which reached number one. Stewart has had 16 top-ten singles in the US, with four reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to music and charity.

==Early life==
Roderick David Stewart was born at 507 Archway Road, Highgate, north London, on 10 January 1945, the youngest of five children of Robert Joseph Stewart (1904–1990) and Elsie Rebecca Gilbart (1905–1996). His father was Scottish and had been a master builder in Leith, Edinburgh, while Elsie was English and had grown up in Upper Holloway in north London. Married in 1928, the couple had two sons and two daughters while living in Scotland, and then they moved to Highgate.

Stewart was born at home during World War II, eight years after his nearest sibling. The family was neither affluent nor poor; Stewart was spoiled as the youngest, and has called his childhood &quot;fantastically happy&quot;. He had an undistinguished record at Highgate Primary School and failed the eleven-plus exam. He then attended the William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (later Fortismere School), Muswell Hill. When his father retired from the building trade he bought a newsagent&#x27;s shop on the Archway Road and the family lived over the shop. Stewart&#x27;s main hobby was railway modelling.

The family was mostly focused on football; Stewart&#x27;s father had played in a local amateur team and managed some teams as well, and one of Stewart&#x27;s earliest memories was of the pictures of Scottish players such as George Young and Gordon Smith that his brothers had on the wall. Stewart was the most talented footballer in the family and was a supporter of Arsenal at the time. Combining natural athleticism with near-reckless aggression, he became captain of the school football team and played for Middlesex Schoolboys as centre-half.

The family were also great fans of the singer Al Jolson and would sing and play his hits. Stewart collected his records and saw his films, read books about him, and was influenced by his performing style and attitude towards his audience. His introduction to rock and roll was hearing Little Richard&#x27;s 1956 hit &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;, and seeing Bill Haley &amp; His Comets in concert. His father bought him a guitar in January 1959; the first song he learned was the folk tune &quot;It Takes a Worried Man to Sing a Worried Song&quot;; the first record he bought was Eddie Cochran&#x27;s &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot;. In 1960, he joined a skiffle group with school friends called the Kool Kats, playing Lonnie Donegan and Chas McDevitt hits.

Stewart left school at the age of 15 and worked briefly as a silk-screen printer. Spurred on by his father, his ambition was to become a professional footballer. In summer 1960, he went for trials at Brentford, a Third Division club at the time. Contrary to some longstanding accounts, Stewart states in his 2012 autobiography that he was never signed to the club and that the club never called him back after his trials. In any case, regarding possible career options, Stewart concluded, &quot;Well, a musician&#x27;s life is a lot easier and I can also get drunk and make music, and I can&#x27;t do that and play football. I plumped for music ... They&#x27;re the only two things I can do actually: play football and sing.&quot;

His parents are buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery, on the main north–south path, opposite the grave of Malcolm McLaren.

==Music career==
===1961–1963: Early work and The Dimensions===
Stewart worked in the family shop and as a newspaper delivery boy. He then worked briefly as a labourer for Highgate Cemetery, which became another part of his biographical lore. He worked in a North Finchley funeral parlour and as a fence erector and sign writer. In 1961, he went to Denmark Street with the Raiders and got a singing audition with well-known record producer Joe Meek, but Meek stopped the session with a rude sound. Stewart began listening to British and American topical folk artists such as Ewan MacColl, Alex Campbell, Woody Guthrie, Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, and especially Derroll Adams and the debut album of Bob Dylan.

Stewart became attracted to beatnik attitudes and left-wing politics, living for a while in a beatnik houseboat at Shoreham-by-Sea. He was an active supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament at this time, joining the annual Aldermaston Marches from 1961 to 1963 and being arrested on three occasions when he took part in sit-ins at Trafalgar Square and Whitehall for the cause. He also used the marches as a way to meet and bed girls. In 1962, he had his first serious relationship, with London art student Suzannah Boffey (a friend of future model and actress Chrissie Shrimpton); he moved to a bed-sit in Muswell Hill to be near her. She became pregnant, but neither Rod nor his family wanted him to enter marriage; the baby girl was given up for adoption and Rod and Suzannah&#x27;s relationship ended.

In 1962, Stewart began hanging around folk singer Wizz Jones, busking at Leicester Square and other London spots. Stewart took up playing the then-fashionable harmonica. On several trips over the next 18 months Jones and Stewart took their act to Brighton and then to Paris, sleeping under bridges over the River Seine, and then finally to Barcelona, from where he was deported from Spain for vagrancy in 1963. At this time, Stewart, who had been at William Grimshaw School with three of the members of the embryonic Kinks, was briefly considered as their singer.

In 1963, Stewart adopted the Mod lifestyle and look, and began fashioning the spiky rooster hairstyle that would become his trademark (it was made possible with sugar water or large amounts of his sisters&#x27; hair lacquer, backcombing, and his hands holding it in place to protect it from the winds of Highgate Underground station).) Disillusioned by rock and roll, he saw Otis Redding perform in concert and began listening to Sam Cooke records; he became fascinated by rhythm and blues and soul music.

After returning to London, Stewart joined a rhythm and blues group, the Dimensions, in October 1963, as a harmonica player and part-time vocalist. It was his first professional job as a musician, although he was still living at home and working in his brother&#x27;s painting and picture-frame shop. A somewhat more established singer from Birmingham, Jimmy Powell, hired the group a few weeks later, and it became known as Jimmy Powell &amp; the Five Dimensions (which also included bassist Louis Cennamo), with Stewart as harmonica player. The group performed weekly at the famed Studio 51 club on Great Newport Street in London, where The Rolling Stones often headlined; this was Stewart&#x27;s entrée into the thriving London R&amp;B scene, and his harmonica playing improved in part from watching Mick Jagger on stage. Relations soon broke down between Powell and Stewart over roles within the group and Stewart departed. Contrary to popular legend, during this time Stewart probably did not play harmonica on Millie Small&#x27;s 1964 hit &quot;My Boy Lollipop&quot;; that was probably Peter Hogman of the Dimensions, although Powell has also claimed credit. Powell did record and release a single during this period, though Stewart did not appear on it.

===1964–1967: Steampacket and &quot;Rod the Mod&quot; image===
In January 1964, while Stewart was waiting at Twickenham railway station after having seen Long John Baldry and the All Stars at Eel Pie Island, Baldry heard him playing &quot;Smokestack Lightnin&#x27;&quot; on his harmonica, and invited him to sit in with the group; when Baldry discovered Stewart was a singer as well, he offered him a job for £35 a week, after securing the approval of Stewart&#x27;s mother. Quitting his day job at the age of nineteen, Stewart gradually overcame his shyness and nerves and became a visible enough part of the act that he was sometimes added to the billing as &quot;Rod the Mod&quot; Stewart, the nickname coming from his dandyish style of grooming and dress. Baldry touted Stewart&#x27;s abilities to &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine and the group enjoyed a weekly residence at London&#x27;s fabled Marquee Club. In June 1964, Stewart made his recording debut (without label credit) on &quot;Up Above My Head&quot;, the B-side to a Baldry and Hoochie Coochie Men single. While still with Baldry, Stewart embarked on a simultaneous solo career. He made some demo recordings, was scouted by Decca Records at the Marquee Club, and signed to a solo contract in August 1964. He appeared on several regional television shows around the country and recorded his first single in September 1964.

Turning down Decca&#x27;s recommended material as too commercial, Stewart insisted that the experienced session musicians he was given, including John Paul Jones, learn a couple of Sonny Boy Williamson songs he had just heard. The resulting single, &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl&quot;, was recorded and released in October 1964. Stewart performed it on the popular television show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;, but it did not enter the charts. Also in October, Stewart left the Hoochie Coochie Men after having a row with Baldry.

Stewart played some dates on his own in late 1964 and early 1965, sometimes backed by the Southampton R&amp;B outfit the Soul Agents. The Hoochie Coochie Men broke up, Baldry and Stewart patched up their differences (and became lifelong friends), and music manager Giorgio Gomelsky put together Steampacket, with Baldry, Stewart, Brian Auger, Julie Driscoll, Micky Waller, Vic Briggs and Ricky Fenson; their first appearance was in support of the Rolling Stones in July 1965. The group was conceived as a white soul revue, analogous to The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue, with multiple vocalists and styles ranging from jazz to R&amp;B to blues. Steampacket toured with the Stones and the Walker Brothers that summer, ending in the London Palladium; seeing the audience react to the Stones gave Stewart his first exposure to crowd hysteria. Stewart, who had been included in the group upon Baldry&#x27;s insistence, ended up with most of the male vocal parts. Steampacket was unable to enter the studio to record any material because its members all belonged to different labels and managers, although Gomelsky did record one of their Marquee Club rehearsals.

Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Rod the Mod&quot; image gained wider visibility in November 1965, when he was the subject of a 30-minute Rediffusion, London television documentary titled &quot;An Easter with Rod&quot; that portrayed the Mod scene. His parallel solo career attempts continued on EMI&#x27;s Columbia label with the November 1965 release of &quot;The Day Will Come&quot;, a more heavily arranged pop attempt, and the April 1966 release of his take on Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Shake&quot;, with the Brian Auger Trinity. Both failed commercially, and neither gained positive notices. Stewart had spent the better part of two years listening mostly to Cooke; he later said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t sound like anybody at all ... but I knew I sounded a bit like Sam Cooke, so I listened to Sam Cooke.&quot; This recording solidified that singer&#x27;s position as Stewart&#x27;s idol and most enduring influence; he called it a &quot;crossing of the water.&quot;

Stewart left Steampacket in March 1966, with Stewart saying he had been sacked and Auger saying he had quit. Stewart then joined a somewhat similar outfit, Shotgun Express, in May 1966 as co-lead vocalist with Beryl Marsden. The other members included Mick Fleetwood and Peter Green (who went on to form Fleetwood Mac), and Peter Bardens. Shotgun Express released one unsuccessful single in October 1966, the orchestra-heavy &quot;I Could Feel The Whole World Turn Round&quot;, before disbanding. Stewart later disparaged Shotgun Express as a poor imitation of Steampacket and said, &quot;I was still getting this terrible feeling of doing other people&#x27;s music. I think you can only start finding yourself when you write your own material.&quot; By now, Stewart had bounced around without achieving much success, with little to distinguish himself among other aspiring London singers other than the emerging rasp in his voice.

===1967–1969: Jeff Beck Group period===
Guitarist Jeff Beck recruited Stewart for his new post-Yardbirds venture, and in February 1967, Stewart joined the Jeff Beck Group as vocalist and sometime songwriter. This would become the big break of his early career. There he first played with Ronnie Wood whom he had first met in a London pub in 1964; the two soon became fast friends. During its first year, the group experienced frequent changes of drummers and conflicts involving manager Mickie Most wanting to reduce Stewart&#x27;s role. They toured the UK and released a couple of singles that featured Stewart on their B-sides. Stewart&#x27;s sputtering solo career also continued with the March 1968 release of non-hit &quot;Little Miss Understood&quot; on Immediate Records.

The Jeff Beck Group toured Western Europe in spring 1968, recorded, and were nearly destitute. Then assistant manager Peter Grant booked them on a six-week tour of the United States starting in June 1968 with the Fillmore East in New York. Stewart, on his first trip to America, suffered terrible stage fright during the opening show and hid behind the amplifier banks while singing. Only a quick shot of brandy brought him out front. Nevertheless, the show and the tour were a big success, with Robert Shelton of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling the group exciting and praising &quot;the interaction of Mr. Beck&#x27;s wild and visionary guitar against the hoarse and insistent shouting of Rod Stewart&quot;, and &quot;New Musical Express&quot; reporting that the group was receiving standing ovations and pulling receipts equal to those of Jimi Hendrix and the Doors.

In August 1968, their first album, &quot;Truth&quot;, was released, and by October, it had risen to number 15 on the US albums chart but failed to chart in the UK. The album featured Beck&#x27;s masterly guitar technique and manipulated sounds as Stewart&#x27;s dramatic vocalising tackled the group&#x27;s varied repertoire of blues, folk, rock, and proto-heavy metal. Stewart also co-wrote three of the songs and credited the record for helping to develop his vocal abilities and the sandpaper quality in his voice. The group toured America again at the end of the year to a strong reception, then suffered from more personnel upheaval (something that would continue throughout Beck&#x27;s career). In July 1969, Stewart left following his friend Wood&#x27;s departure. Stewart later recalled, &quot;It was a great band to sing with, but I couldn&#x27;t take all the aggravation and unfriendliness that developed... In the two and a half years I was with Beck I never once looked him in the eye – I always looked at his shirt or something like that.&quot;

The group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Beck-Ola&quot;, was released in June 1969 in the US and in September 1969 in the UK, bracketing the time the group was dissolving; it also made number 15 in the US albums chart and reached number 39 in the UK albums chart. During his time with the group, Stewart initially felt overmatched by Beck&#x27;s presence, and his style was still developing; but later Stewart felt the two developed a strong musical, if not personal, rapport. Much of Stewart&#x27;s sense of phrasing was developed during his time with the Jeff Beck Group. Beck sought to form a new supergroup with Carmine Appice and Tim Bogert (of the similarly just-breaking-up Vanilla Fudge) joining him and Stewart, but Stewart had other plans.

===1969–1975: Solo career established and Faces albums===
Mercury Records A&amp;R man Lou Reizner had seen Stewart perform with Beck, and on 8 October 1968 signed him to a solo contract; but contractual complexities delayed Stewart&#x27;s recording for him until July 1969. Meanwhile, in May 1969, guitarist and singer Steve Marriott left English band the Small Faces. Ron Wood replaced him as guitarist in June and on 18 October 1969, Stewart followed his friend and became the band&#x27;s new singer. The two joined existing members Ronnie Lane, Ian McLagan, and Kenney Jones, who soon decided to call the new line-up Faces.

&quot;An Old Raincoat Won&#x27;t Ever Let You Down&quot; became Stewart&#x27;s first solo album in 1969 (it was known as &quot;The Rod Stewart Album&quot; in the US). It established the template for his solo sound: a heartfelt mixture of folk, rock, and country blues, inclusive of a British working-class sensibility, with both original material (&quot;Cindy&#x27;s Lament&quot; and the title song) and cover versions (Ewan MacColl&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot; and Mike d&#x27;Abo&#x27;s &quot;Handbags and Gladrags&quot;). The backing band on the album included Wood, Waller and McLagan, plus Keith Emerson and guitarists Martin Pugh (of Steamhammer, and later Armageddon and 7th Order) and Martin Quittenton (also from Steamhammer).
Faces released their debut album, &quot;First Step&quot;, in early 1970 with a rock and roll style similar to the Rolling Stones. While the album did better in the UK than in the US, the Faces quickly earned a strong live following. Stewart released his second album, &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; that autumn. Stewart&#x27;s approach was similar to his first album and mandolin was introduced into the sound. He then launched a US tour with the Faces. Stewart sang guest vocals for the Australian group Python Lee Jackson on &quot;In a Broken Dream&quot;, recorded in April 1969 but not released until 1970. His payment was a set of seat covers for his car. It was re-released in 1972 to become a worldwide hit.

Stewart&#x27;s 1971 solo album &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story&quot; made him a household name when the B-side of his minor hit &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;, &quot;Maggie May&quot;, (co-written with Martin Quittenton) started to receive radio play. The album and the single occupied the number one chart position simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, a chart first, in September. &quot;Maggie May&quot; topped the single chart for five weeks in the US, and the UK and four weeks in Australia. Set off by a striking mandolin part (by Ray Jackson of Lindisfarne), &quot;Maggie May&quot; was also named in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. The rest of the album was equally strong, with &quot;Mandolin Wind&quot; again showcasing that instrument; &quot;(I Know) I&#x27;m Losing You&quot; adding hard-edged soul to the mix; and &quot;Tomorrow Is a Long Time&quot;, a cover of a Bob Dylan song. But the ultimate manifestation of the early Stewart solo style was the Stewart-Wood-penned &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story&quot; itself: powered by Mick Waller&#x27;s drumming, Pete Sears&#x27;s piano and Wood&#x27;s guitar work in a largely acoustic arrangement; it is a song relating to the picaresque adventures of the singer.

The second Faces album, &quot;Long Player&quot;, was released in early 1971 and enjoyed greater chart success than &quot;First Step&quot;. Faces also got their only US Top 40 hit with &quot;Stay With Me&quot; from their third album &quot;A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...To a Blind Horse&quot; released in late 1971. This album reached the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic on the back of the success of &quot;Every Picture Tells A Story&quot;. Steve Jones from The Sex Pistols regarded the Faces highly and named them as a main influence on the British punk rock movement.

The Faces toured extensively in 1972 with growing tension in the band over Stewart&#x27;s solo career enjoying more success than the band&#x27;s. Stewart released &quot;Never a Dull Moment&quot; in the same year. Repeating the &quot;Every Picture&quot; formula, for the most part, it reached number two on the US album charts and number one in the UK, and enjoyed further good notices from reviewers. &quot;You Wear It Well&quot; was a hit single that reached number 13 in the US and went to number one in the UK, while &quot;Twisting the Night Away&quot; made explicit Stewart&#x27;s debt to Sam Cooke.

For the body of his early solo work Stewart earned tremendous critical praise. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 1980 &quot;Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; includes this in its Stewart entry:

Rarely has a singer had as full and unique a talent as Rod Stewart; rarely has anyone betrayed his talent so completely. Once the most compassionate presence in music, he has become a bilious self-parody – and sells more records than ever [... A] writer who offered profound lyricism and fabulous self-deprecating humour, teller of tall tales and honest heartbreaker, he had an unmatched eye for the tiny details around which lives turn, shatter, and reform [...] and a voice to make those details indelible. [... His solo albums] were defined by two special qualities: warmth, which was redemptive, and modesty, which was liberating. If ever any rocker chose the role of everyman and lived up to it, it was Rod Stewart.

The Faces released their final album &quot;Ooh La La,&quot; which reached number one in the UK and number 21 in the US in 1973. During the recording of the album, the rift between Stewart and the rest of the Faces grew further, as (according to Ian McLagan), Stewart did not participate until two weeks into the sessions, &quot;and then complained that some songs were in the wrong key for him. So we recorded them again and waited a week for him to come back. We cut the track for &#x27;Ooh La La&#x27; three times before he eventually passed on it, leaving it for Woody to sing. [...] The week the album came out he did all he could to scuttle it and told anyone who would listen how useless it was.&quot; The band toured Australasia, Japan, Europe and the UK in 1974 to support the album and the single &quot;Pool Hall Richard&quot;.

In late 1974, Stewart released his &quot;Smiler&quot; album. In Britain, it reached number one, and the single &quot;Farewell&quot; number seven, but only number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop album charts and the single &quot;Mine for Me&quot; only number 91 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles charts. It was his last original album for Mercury Records. After the release of the double album compilation &quot;The Best of Rod Stewart&quot; he switched to Warner Bros. Records and remained with them throughout the vast majority of his career (Faces were signed to Warner Bros., and Stewart&#x27;s solo releases in the UK appeared on the Riva label until 1981). In 1975, Faces toured the US twice (with Ronnie Wood joining the Rolling Stones&#x27; US tour in between). With Ronnie Wood having released his second solo album in 1975 and also having joined the Rolling Stones (first as a temporary replacement for the departing Mick Taylor, and later as a permanent member), as well as Stewart&#x27;s own burgeoning solo career, it became impossible to maintain the Faces as a viable band, so the Faces broke up at the end of the year.

===1975–1988: Height of fame and critical reaction===

In 1975, Stewart moved to Los Angeles; that year, he released the &quot;Atlantic Crossing&quot; album for his new record company, using producer Tom Dowd and a different sound based on the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. &quot;Atlantic Crossing&quot; marked both a return to form and a return to the Top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts. The first single, a cover of the Sutherland Brothers song &quot;Sailing&quot;, was a number-one hit in the UK, charted high in other European countries and in Australia, but only reached the Top 60 of the US and Canadian charts. The single returned to the UK Top 10 a year later when used as the theme music for a BBC documentary series about . Having been a hit twice over, &quot;Sailing&quot; became, and remains, Stewart&#x27;s biggest-selling single in the UK. His Holland-Dozier-Holland cover &quot;This Old Heart of Mine&quot; was also a Top 100 hit in 1976. In 1976, Stewart covered the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Get Back&quot; for the musical documentary &quot;All This and World War II&quot;.

Later in 1976, Stewart topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for eight weeks and the Australian ARIA chart with the ballad &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;, with an accompanying music video featuring actress Britt Ekland. It came from the &quot;A Night on the Town&quot; album, which went to number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts and was Stewart&#x27;s first album to go platinum. By explicitly marking the album as having a &quot;fast side&quot; and a &quot;slow side&quot;, Stewart continued the trend started by &quot;Atlantic Crossing&quot;. &quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot;, a cover of a Cat Stevens song, went number one in the UK in 1977, and top 30 in the US. &quot;The Killing of Georgie (Part 1 and 2)&quot;, about the murder of a gay man, was also a Top 40 hit for Stewart during 1977.

&quot;Foot Loose &amp; Fancy Free&quot; (1977) featured Stewart&#x27;s own band, the original Rod Stewart Group that featured Carmine Appice, Phil Chen, Jim Cregan, Billy Peek, Gary Grainger and John Jarvis. It continued Stewart&#x27;s run of chart success, reaching number two. &quot;You&#x27;re in My Heart&quot; was the hit single, reaching number four in the US.

&quot;Hot Legs&quot; achieved a lot of radio airplay as did the confessional &quot;I Was Only Joking&quot;. In appearance, Stewart&#x27;s look had evolved to include a glam element, including make-up and spandex clothes. Stewart scored another UK number one and US number one single with &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot;, which was a crossover hit reaching number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; black charts due to its disco sound. This was the lead single from 1978&#x27;s &quot;Blondes Have More Fun&quot;, which went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts and sold three million albums.

A focal point of criticisms about this period was his biggest-selling 1978 disco hit &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot;, which was atypical of his earlier output, and disparaged by critics. In interviews, Stewart, while admitting his accompanying look had become &quot;tarty&quot;, has defended the lyrics by pointing out that the song is a third-person narrative slice-of-life portrayal, not unlike those in his earlier work, and that it is not about him. The song&#x27;s refrain was identical to Brazilian Jorge Ben Jor&#x27;s earlier &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; and a lawsuit ensued. Stewart donated his royalties from &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; to UNICEF, and he performed it with his band at the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly in 1979.

Stewart moved to a more new wave direction in 1980 by releasing the album &quot;Foolish Behaviour&quot;. The album produced one hit single, &quot;Passion&quot;, which reached No. 5 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Charts. In August 1981, MTV was launched in the US with several of Stewart&#x27;s videos in heavy rotation. Later in 1981, Stewart added further elements of new wave and synthpop to his sound for the &quot;Tonight I&#x27;m Yours&quot; album. The title song reached No. 20 in the US, while &quot;Young Turks&quot; reached the Top 5 with the album going platinum. On 18 December 1981, Stewart played the Los Angeles Forum, along with Kim Carnes and Tina Turner, in a concert broadcast worldwide via satellite.
Stewart was criticised by the anti-apartheid movement for breaking a widely observed cultural boycott of apartheid South Africa by performing at the Sun City resort complex in Bophuthatswana as part of his Body Wishes (1983) and Camouflage (1984) tours.

Stewart had four US Top 10 singles between 1982 and 1988; &quot;Young Turks&quot; (No. 5, carrying over from 1981 into 1982), &quot;Some Guys Have All the Luck&quot; (No. 10, 1984), &quot;Infatuation&quot; (No. 6, 1984) and &quot;Love Touch&quot; (No. 6, 1986, a Holly Knight/Mike Chapman collaboration). &quot;Baby Jane&quot; reached No. 14 in 1983, but went to No. 1 in the UK, his final chart-topping single there to date. The corresponding &quot;Camouflage&quot; album went gold in the UK, and the single &quot;Infatuation&quot; (which featured his old friend Jeff Beck on the guitar) received considerable play on MTV. The second single &quot;Some Guys Have All The Luck&quot; reached No. 15 in the UK and No. 10 in the US.

A reunion with Jeff Beck produced a successful take on Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;People Get Ready&quot;, but an attempt to tour together fell apart after a few dates. In the UK, &quot;Every Beat of My Heart&quot; reached number two in 1986. In January 1985, Stewart performed to a large audience at the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro.

===1988–1994: Out of Order Tour, &quot;Vagabond Heart&quot; and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame===
In 1988, Stewart returned with &quot;Out of Order&quot;, produced by Duran Duran&#x27;s Andy Taylor and by Bernard Edwards of Chic. &quot;Lost in You&quot;, &quot;Forever Young&quot;, &quot;Crazy About Her&quot;, and &quot;My Heart Can&#x27;t Tell You No&quot; from that album were all top 15 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and mainstream rock charts, with the latter even reaching the Top Five. &quot;Forever Young&quot; was an unconscious revision of Bob Dylan&#x27;s song of the same name; the artists reached an agreement about sharing royalties. The song reached No. 12 in the US. In September 1988, Stewart performed &quot;Forever Young&quot; at the 1988 MTV Video Music Awards at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, and in 1989 he received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song.

In January 1989, Stewart set out on the South American leg of the Out of Order Tour playing to sell-out audiences throughout Americas. There were 80,000 people at his show at Corregidora Stadium, Querétaro, México (9 April), and 50,000 at Jalisco Stadium, Guadalajara, Jalisco (12 April). In Buenos Aires, the audience at the River Plate Stadium, which seats 70,000+, was at over 90,000, with several thousand outside the stadium. Firehoses were sprayed on the crowd to avoid heat prostration.

Stewart&#x27;s version of the Tom Waits song &quot;Downtown Train&quot; went to number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1990. This song was taken from a four-CD compilation set called &quot;Storyteller – The Complete Anthology: 1964–1990&quot;.

Released in 1991, the &quot;Vagabond Heart&quot; album continued Stewart&#x27;s renewal and inspiration. The lead single, &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, with Tina Turner, was released in 1990 in advance of the full album&#x27;s release, and reached number five on the UK charts, but did not chart in the US. The follow-up songs from &quot;Vagabond Heart&quot; both reached the Billboard Hot 100 in 1991, with &quot;Rhythm of My Heart&quot; peaking at No. 5 and &quot;The Motown Song&quot; peaking at No. 10. 
At the 1993 Brit Awards in London, Stewart picked up the prize for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Stewart brought back the Faces on stage for an impromptu reunion. In 1993, Stewart recorded &quot;All For Love&quot; with Sting and Bryan Adams for the soundtrack to the movie &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;; the single reached number one in the US and number two in the UK. Also in 1993, he reunited with Ronnie Wood to record an &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; special that included &quot;Handbags and Gladrags&quot;, &quot;Cut Across Shorty&quot;, and four selections from &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story&quot;. The show featured an acoustic version of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Have I Told You Lately&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; adult contemporary chart and No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. A rendition of &quot;Reason to Believe&quot; also garnered considerable airplay. The resulting &quot;Unplugged...and Seated&quot; album reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts.

Stewart was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, presented by Jeff Beck. On 31 December 1994, Stewart played in front of 3.5 million people on Copacabana beach in Rio, and made it into the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for staging the largest free rock concert attendance in history.

===1995–2001: New ventures and record labels===

By the early 1990s, Stewart had mostly abandoned creating his own material, saying that he was not a natural songwriter and that the tepid response to his recent efforts was not rewarding. In 1995, Stewart released &quot;A Spanner in the Works&quot; containing a single written by Tom Petty, &quot;Leave Virginia Alone&quot;, which reached the Top 10 of the adult contemporary charts. The latter half of the 1990s was not as commercially successful though the 1996 album &quot;If We Fall in Love Tonight&quot; reached number 8 in the UK and went gold and hit No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart.

&quot;When We Were the New Boys&quot;, his final album on the Warner Bros. label released in 1998, contained versions of songs by Britpop acts such as Oasis and Primal Scream, and reached number two on the UK album charts. That same year, he recorded the song &quot;Faith of the Heart&quot;, written by Diane Warren, for the film &quot;Patch Adams&quot;. In 2000, Stewart left Warner Bros. and moved to Atlantic Records, another division of Warner Music Group. In 2001, he released &quot;Human&quot;. The single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Deny It&quot; went Top 40 in the UK and Top 20 in the adult contemporary. Stewart then signed to Clive Davis&#x27; new J Records label. &quot;The Story So Far: The Very Best of Rod Stewart&quot;, a greatest hits album compiled from his time at Warner Bros., is certified four times platinum in the UK with over 1.2 million copies sold and reached number one in 2001 in Belgium and France.

===2002–2010: &quot;The Great American Songbook&quot; series and &quot;Soulbook&quot;===
In June 2002, Stewart performed &quot;Handbags and Gladrags&quot; at the Party at the Palace held at Buckingham Palace Garden, a concert which celebrated the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II and featured stars from five decades of music.

By 2002, Stewart had sold over 100 million records during his career. While growing up, he heard in his home classic songs written by songwriters such as Cole Porter, Gus Kahn and George and Ira Gershwin. Stewart joined others who had recorded the classic songs. He concentrated on singing 1930s and 1940s pop standards from the Great American Songbook with great popular success. These albums have been released on Clive Davis&#x27;s J Records label and have seen Stewart enjoy album sales equal to the 1970s.

The first album from the songbook series, &quot;It Had to Be You: the Great American Songbook&quot;, reached number four on the US album chart, number eight in the UK and number ten in Canada when released in late 2002. The track &quot;These Foolish Things&quot; (which is actually a British, not American, song) reached number 13 on the Billboard adult contemporary chart, and &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away From Me&quot; went Top 20.

The second series album, &quot;As Time Goes By: the Great American Songbook 2&quot;, reached number two in the US, number four in the UK and number one in Canada. &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&quot;, a duet with Cher, went Top 20 on the US adult contemporary charts. &quot;Time After Time&quot; was another Top 30 track on the US adult contemporary charts. A musical called &quot;Tonight&#x27;s The Night&quot;, featuring many of Stewart&#x27;s songs, opened 7 November 2003 at London&#x27;s Victoria Palace Theatre. It is written and directed by Ben Elton, who previously created a similar production, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, with music by Queen. The musical tells about a &quot;Faustian pact between Detroit gas station mechanic Stu Clutterbuck and Satan.&quot;

In 2004, Stewart reunited with Ronnie Wood for concerts of Faces material. A Rod Stewart and the Faces best of album, &quot;Changing Faces&quot;, reached the Top 20 of the UK album charts. &quot;Five Guys Walk into a Bar...&quot;, a Faces box set compilation, was released. In late 2004, &quot;&quot;, the third album in Stewart&#x27;s songbook series, was released. It was his first US number one album in 25 years, selling over 200,000 albums in its first week. It also debuted at number one in Canada, number three in the UK and Top 10 in Australia. His version of Louis Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, featuring Stevie Wonder, made the Top 20 of the world adult charts. He also recorded a duet with Dolly Parton for the album – &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot;. Stewart won his first ever Grammy Award for this album.

2005 saw the release of the fourth songbook album, &quot;Thanks for the Memory: The Great American Songbook 4&quot;; it included duets with Diana Ross and Elton John. Within weeks of its release, the CD made it to number two on the Top 200 list. In late 2006, Stewart made his return to rock music and his new approach to country music with the release of &quot;Still the Same... Great Rock Classics of Our Time&quot;, a new album featuring rock and southern rock milestones from the last four decades, including a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot;, which was released as the first single. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts with 184,000 copies in its first week. The number one debut was helped by a concert in New York City that was on MSN Music and an appearance on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He performed tracks from his new album live from the Nokia Theater on 9 October. Control Room broadcast the event Live on MSN and in 117 cinemas across the country via National CineMedia. In November 2006, Stewart was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame.

On 1 July 2007, Stewart performed at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London, an event which celebrated the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death. He performed &quot;Sailing&quot;, &quot;Baby Jane&quot; and &quot;Maggie May&quot;. On 12 December, he performed for the first time at the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; at the London Coliseum in front of HRH Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall, singing another Cat Stevens number, &quot;Father and Son&quot;, and Bonnie Tyler&#x27;s song &quot;It&#x27;s a Heartache&quot;. On 22 December 2006, Stewart hosted the 8th Annual &quot;A Home for the Holidays&quot; special on CBS at 8:00 pm (PST).

On 20 May 2009, Stewart performed &quot;Maggie May&quot; on the grand finale of &quot;American Idol&quot; season 8. On 2, July 2009 Stewart performed his only UK date that year at Home Park, Plymouth. On 29 September 2009 a 4-CD, 65-track compilation entitled &quot;Rod Stewart Sessions 1971–1998&quot; was released; it is composed of previously unreleased tracks and outtakes from the bulk of his career. Stewart has also mentioned plans for a compilation of covers of soul classics, the possible release of another edition of the &quot;Great American Songbook&quot; album and a country covers album.

On 17 October 2009, Stewart released the studio album &quot;Soulbook&quot; which was composed of covers of soul and Motown songs. On 14 November 2009, Stewart recorded a TV program in the UK for ITV that was screened on 5 December 2009. The music in the programme featured tracks from his new album and some old favourites. On 14 January 2010, Rhino records released Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Once in a Blue Moon&quot;, a &quot;lost album&quot; originally recorded in 1992, featuring ten cover songs including the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;, Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Groom&#x27;s Still Waiting at the Altar&quot; and Stevie Nicks&#x27; &quot;Stand Back&quot;, as well as Tom Waits&#x27; &quot;Tom Traubert&#x27;s Blues&quot;. On 19 October 2010, Stewart released another edition of his Great American Songbook series titled &quot;Fly Me to the Moon...The Great American Songbook Volume V&quot; on J Records.

===2011–2012: Christmas album and autobiography===

In 2011, Stewart performed with Stevie Nicks on their Heart &amp; Soul Tour. Starting on 20 March in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the tour visited arena concerts in North America – with performances in New York, Toronto, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, Tampa and Montreal, among others.

Stewart headlined the Sunday show at the 2011 Hard Rock Calling Festival on 26 June in London&#x27;s Hyde Park. Stewart signed on to a two-year residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, commencing on 24 August. Performing his greatest hits, the residency also saw him perform selected tracks from his upcoming, untitled blues album.

On 7 June 2012, Stewart signed a recording agreement with Universal Music Group. Stewart released his first Christmas album, titled &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot;, on the Verve Music Group label (a division of Universal Music Group) on 30 October 2012. The album was produced by David Foster and contained several duets, as well as an original song written by Stewart, Foster and Amy Foster called &quot;Red-Suited Super Man&quot;. According to IFPI, &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot; was the seventh best-selling album worldwide in 2012. In October 2012, Stewart&#x27;s autobiography titled &quot;Rod: The Autobiography&quot; was released (exact dates vary worldwide).

In November 2012, Stewart performed &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; from his Christmas album and his hit &quot;Sailing&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall for the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance, which was attended by Queen Elizabeth II. Later that month, Stewart again performed at the Royal Albert Hall in front of the Queen during the 100th Royal Variety Performance, singing &quot;When You Wish upon a Star&quot;. On 26 November, Stewart&#x27;s recording of &quot;Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!&quot; reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary Chart. Stewart had the number one song on this chart three times previously, the last being in 1993 with &quot;Have I Told You Lately&quot;, giving him the second-largest hiatus between number ones in the history of the chart. The song remained in the No. 1 spot for five weeks, tying it for the longest-leading holiday title in the chart&#x27;s 51-year history. On 10 December 2012, Stewart was a guest singer on Michael Bublé&#x27;s television &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; Christmas special. Stewart was the tenth best-selling artist in Canada in the year 2012, according to year-end sales data from Nielsen Soundscan Canada. In February 2013, Stewart was nominated for a Canadian Juno Award in the International Album of the Year category for his album &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot;.

===2013–2015: Return to songwriting – &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Another Country&quot;===

In May 2013, Stewart released &quot;Time&quot;, a rock album of his own original material. It marked a return to songwriting after what Stewart termed &quot;a dark period of twenty years&quot;; he said that writing his autobiography gave him the impetus to write music again. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1, setting a new British record for the longest gap between chart-topping albums by an artist. Stewart&#x27;s last No. 1 on the chart had been &quot;Greatest Hits Volume 1&quot; in 1979 and his last studio album to top the chart was 1976&#x27;s &quot;A Night on the Town&quot;.

In September 2013, Stewart presented his friend Elton John with the first Brits Icon award in a special show at the London Palladium, recognising John&#x27;s &quot;lasting impact&quot; on UK culture. Stewart quipped that John was &quot;the second-best rock singer ever&quot;, before the two performed a duet on stage.

A new studio album, &quot;Another Country&quot;, was released on 23 October 2015. The video for the first single &quot;Love Is&quot; is available on his Vevo account.

===2016–present: Continuing to record – &quot;Blood Red Roses&quot; and &quot;The Tears of Hercules&quot;===
Stewart recorded vocals with Joe Walsh on the Frankie Miller album &quot;Frankie Miller&#x27;s Double Take&quot;, which was released on 30 September 2016. He sang his cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; as Sgt. Pepper for &quot;Beat Bugs&quot; episode 17b, which debuted 18 November 2016 on Netflix. At the same, Stewart was quoted responding to John Lennon&#x27;s 1980 assertion that Stewart&#x27;s hit &quot;The Killing of Georgie (Part 1 and 2)&quot; plagiarised his song &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;, declaring to &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;It does sound like it, [...] Nothing wrong with a good steal!&quot;.

On 28 September 2018, Stewart released his 30th studio album, &quot;Blood Red Roses&quot;, on Republic Records. He duets with Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler on the track &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; from her 2019 studio album, &quot;Between the Earth and the Stars&quot;. Stewart collaborated with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra for the release of &quot;You&#x27;re in My Heart&quot; in November 2019. The album contains new versions of the hit songs &quot;Maggie May&quot;, and &quot;It Takes Two&quot; with Robbie Williams.

On 22 November 2019, Stewart released &quot;You&#x27;re in My Heart: Rod Stewart with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra&quot;, produced by Trevor Horn. The album contains vocal tracks from UK number one hits &quot;Sailing&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want To Talk About It&quot; and &quot;The First Cut is the Deepest&quot; with new arrangements performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as 1971 chart toppers in both the UK and US &quot;Maggie May&quot; and &quot;Reasons to Believe&quot;. The release of &quot;You&#x27;re In My Heart&quot; coincided with Stewart&#x27;s biggest-ever UK stadium tour throughout November and December 2019, a continuation of his successful summer stadium tour. &quot;You&#x27;re In My Heart&quot; also included &quot;Stop Loving Her Today&quot;, a new song, as well as a new recording of &quot;It Takes Two&quot; featuring Robbie Williams. &quot;You&#x27;re in My Heart&quot; topped the UK Albums Chart, staying in the number one position for three weeks and making it his tenth UK chart-topping album. Stewart released his 31st studio album &quot;The Tears of Hercules&quot; in November 2021. Stewart is only the fifth British act in UK chart history with 10 or more number-one albums, and BPI Certified – Gold.

In June 2022, Stewart performed at the Platinum Party at the Palace. In November 2022, he revealed that he had refused to perform in Qatar the year before, despite an offer of &quot;over $1m&quot;, citing the country&#x27;s human rights record. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Stewart at No. 49 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. In May 2023, Stewart performed at the Jeff Beck tribute concerts held at the Royal Albert Hall, sharing the stage with Ronnie Wood, Eric Clapton, Kirk Hammett and Johnny Depp among others.

In late 2023, Warner Music announced a new album, &quot;Swing Fever&quot;, recorded with Jools Holland&#x27;s Rhythm And Blues Orchestra, for 23 February 2024 release. A single from the album, &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot;, was released on 5 December.

In February 2024, Irving Azoff&#x27;s Iconic Artists Group acquired Stewart&#x27;s catalogue for close to $100M.

In November 2024, Stewart was confirmed to play the Glastonbury Legends slot in 2025, 23 years after his last appearance at the festival.

==Personal life==
In May 2000, Stewart was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, for which he underwent surgery the same month. It had been previously reported he suffered from a benign vocal cord nodule. Besides being a major health scare, the resulting surgery also threatened his voice, and he had to re-learn how to sing. Since then he has been active in raising funds for The City of Hope Foundation charity to find cures for all forms of cancer, especially those affecting children. In September 2019, Stewart revealed that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2017, and was given the all-clear after treatment.

Before returning to the UK, Stewart played for his LA Exiles team made up of mostly English expatriates plus a few celebrities, including Billy Duffy of the Cult, in a senior soccer league in Palos Verdes, California.

Despite his father having been a supporter of Hibernian, Stewart is a supporter of Celtic, which he mentions in &quot;You&#x27;re in My Heart&quot;. He supports the Scotland national team and follows Manchester United as his English side, and he explains his love affair with both Celtic and Manchester United in Frank Worrall&#x27;s book, &quot;Celtic United&quot;. Stewart clarifies this more in his 2012 book (pp. 163–64), &quot;Rod: The Autobiography&quot;, mentioning he &quot;only had an attachment to Manchester United in the 1970s, but that was because they had so many great Scottish players in the 1970s, including Denis Law ... When I did eventually click with a team, it was Celtic&quot;. He presented Celtic with the trophy after they won the 2015 Scottish League Cup Final.

Stewart is a model railway enthusiast. His HO scale layout in his Los Angeles home is modelled after the New York Central and the Pennsylvania Railroads during the 1940s. Called the Three Rivers City, the layout was featured in the cover story of the December 2007, December 2010, February 2014, June 2017, December 2024 and January 2025 issues of &quot;Model Railroader&quot; magazine. In the 2007 article, Stewart said that it meant more to him to be in a model railroad magazine than a music magazine. The layout, which has a mainline run of , uses code 70 flextrack and a Digital Command Control (DCC) system made by Digitrax. Stewart has a second, smaller layout at his UK home, based on Britain&#x27;s East Coast Main Line. In a sidebar to the 2014 &quot;Model Railroader&quot; article, Stewart confirmed (in an anecdote about having unwittingly mixed red scenery texturing material into a &quot;turf&quot; mix he used around the bases of buildings) that he is colour-blind. In a 2019 interview with &quot;Railway Modeller&quot; magazine, he said that the hobby is &quot;addictive&quot; for him.

Stewart has admitted to taking cocaine in the past.

A car collector, Stewart owns one of the 400 Ferrari Enzos. In 1982, Stewart was car-jacked on Los Angeles&#x27; Sunset Boulevard while he was parking his $50,000 Porsche. The car was subsequently recovered. In March 2022, Stewart and others personally filled in some potholes on the country lane near his Essex residence, claiming that an ambulance had burst a tyre and his Ferrari could not get through. Dominic Zaria, one of Stewart&#x27;s neighbours, praised the singer&#x27;s action and said the lane had &quot;a massive crack&quot; and could be dangerous when it was dark and wet. In response, the county council cautioned that potholes should be reported and repaired by professionals, adding residents making their own repairs &quot;could become liable for any problems or accidents&quot;.

In September 2002, Stewart&#x27;s son Sean was sentenced to three months in jail and required to pay compensation and attend anger management, drug and alcohol treatment courses for attacking a man outside a restaurant in Los Angeles.
Rod Stewart was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2007 New Year Honours for services to music. At his investiture in July 2007, at Buckingham Palace, Stewart commented: &quot;It&#x27;s a marvellous occasion. We&#x27;re the only country in the world to honour the common man.&quot; He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for &quot;services to music and charity&quot;.

Stewart was estimated to have a fortune of £215 million in the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; of 2021, making him the 12th wealthiest person in the British music industry. He lives with his wife in the Grade II listed Durrington House, a £4.65 million property in Essex.

During February 2023, it was announced that Stewart paid for a day&#x27;s worth of MRI scans for patients at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow in order to aid in reducing waiting lists.

===Relationships and family===

Stewart has eight children, by five mothers:
In reference to his divorces, Stewart was once quoted as saying, &quot;Instead of getting married again, I&#x27;m going to find a woman I don&#x27;t like and just give her a house.&quot;

In January 2020, Stewart and his 39-year-old son Sean were arrested, and both were charged with battery following an incident at a Florida hotel. The case was resolved in 2021, with both Stewarts pleading guilty to simple battery in a plea agreement that included no jail time, no probation, and no fine.

<doc id="105410" wikidata="Q640786" url="?curid=105410" title="Troma Entertainment">
<text>Troma Entertainment is an American independent film production and distribution company founded by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz in 1974. The company produces low-budget independent films, or &quot;B movies&quot;, primarily of the horror comedy genre, all geared exclusively to mature audiences. Many of them play on 1950s horror with elements of farce, parody, gore, and splatter.

Troma has produced, acquired, and distributed over 1,000 independent films since its creation. Films produced and distributed by Troma include &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; (1984) and its sequels; &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High&quot; (1986) and its sequels; &quot;Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.&quot; (1990); &quot;Tromeo and Juliet&quot; (1996); &quot;Terror Firmer&quot; (1999); and &quot;&quot; (2006).

In 2012, the company officially released many of its films on YouTube. However, their YouTube channel was eventually terminated for not meeting community standards.

As of 2023, Troma&#x27;s slogan is &quot;50 years of Disrupting Media.&quot; Its slogan in 2014 was &quot;40 years of Disrupting Media&quot;. Before that, the slogan was &quot;30 Years of Reel Independent Cinema&quot;. Another slogan the company has used is &quot;Movies of the Future.&quot; The company also has its own streaming service called Troma Now.

The name &quot;Troma&quot; is a neologism derived from the Greek word &quot;tromos&quot; (τρόμος), meaning &quot;horror,&quot; which comes from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;trem-,&quot; meaning &quot;to tremble.&quot; 

==Company information==

Troma films are B-movies known for their surrealistic or automatistic nature, along with their use of shocking imagery; some would categorize them as &quot;shock exploitation films&quot;. They typically contain overt sexuality, nudity, and intentionally sadistic, gory, and blatant graphic violence, so much so that &quot;Troma film&quot; has become a term synonymous with these characteristics.

Troma reuses the same props, actors, and scenes repeatedly, sometimes to save money. At a certain point, however, this became yet another hallmark of Troma. Examples include a severed leg, a penis monster, and the flipping and exploding car filmed for the movie &quot;Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.&quot;, which is used in place of any other car that needs to crash and explode.

Troma has produced or acquired early films featuring several rising talents, before they were discovered, including:

*Oliver Stone in &quot;The Battle of Love&#x27;s Return&quot; (1971), in which the future Academy Award-winning director made his debut as an actor
*Paul Sorvino in &quot;Cry Uncle!&quot; (1971)
*Vanna White in &quot;Graduation Day&quot; (1981)
*Kevin Costner in &quot;Sizzle Beach, U.S.A.&quot; (1981)
*J. J. Abrams in &quot;Nightbeast&quot; (1982)
*Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio in &quot;The First Turn-On!&quot; (1983)
*Marisa Tomei in &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; (1984)
*Michael Jai White in &quot;The Toxic Avenger Part II&quot; (1989)
*Billy Bob Thornton in &quot;Chopper Chicks in Zombietown&quot; (1989)
*Samuel L. Jackson in &quot;Def by Temptation&quot; (1990)
*Trey Parker and Matt Stone in &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot; (1993)
*David Boreanaz in &quot;Macabre Pair of Shorts&quot; (1996)
*James Gunn in &quot;Tromeo and Juliet&quot; (1996)
*Carmen Electra in &quot;The Chosen One&quot; (1998)

The studio prides itself on its self-imposed &quot;Rules of Production&quot;:

# Safety to humans
# Safety to property
# Make a good movie! (written in smaller font than the first two)

Their latest production has been &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Shitstorm&quot; (2020).

==History==
In the mid-1970s, Kaufman and Herz began producing, directing, and distributing raunchy sex comedies such as &quot;The First Turn-On!&quot; and &quot;Squeeze Play!&quot;. Troma provided production support for Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;, for which Kaufman served as a production manager.

In 1984, Troma had a hit with the violent comedy horror superhero film &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot;. The film went on to become Troma&#x27;s most popular, spawning sequels and an animated television program. However, following the financial demise of the company Troma itself, the sequels to the film were box office bombs, and the cartoon adaptation quickly ended. The Toxic Avenger character is now Troma&#x27;s official mascot.

Kaufman&#x27;s follow-up film to &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; was &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High&quot;, co-directed with Richard W. Haines. The film was a hit nearly as successful, though it inspired two unsuccessful sequels, both following the financial demise of Troma. At one time, it was the highest-selling VHS release for Troma.

&quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; was turned into a musical which debuted at the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and opened in New York in the fall of 2008. &quot;The Toxic Avenger Musical&quot; book by Joe DiPietro, the author of the long-running &quot;I Love You, You&#x27;re Perfect, Now Change&quot; and &quot;All Shook Up&quot;, was released the same year. The music is by David Bryan, keyboardist of the rock band Bon Jovi.

Soon after &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High&quot; was completed and distributed, Kaufman directed &quot;Troma&#x27;s War&quot;. Intended as a criticism of what it saw as Ronald Reagan&#x27;s attempt to glamorize war, the story concerns a group of everyday people who crash land on a remote island, only to find it populated by an isolationist militia that intends to overthrow the US government. &quot;Troma&#x27;s War&quot; was a box office bomb. In the aftermath of the film&#x27;s poor performance, despite another stab at the superhero genre with &quot;Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.&quot;, Troma experienced financial hardship and tried to reestablish itself as a smaller company mostly out of necessity.

==Work since 1995==
From 1995 to 2000, Troma had a period of creativity and produced some of their greatest work. Kaufman directed three independent films, all distributed in limited theatrical releases: &quot;Tromeo and Juliet&quot;, a loose parody of Shakespeare&#x27;s play; &quot;Terror Firmer&quot;, a slasher film loosely based on Kaufman&#x27;s book &quot;All I Need to Know About Filmmaking I Learned from The Toxic Avenger&quot;, and an independent film sequel to &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; trilogy titled &quot;Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV&quot;.

Troma&#x27;s financial hardship worsened after the botched funding of a low-budget video feature titled &quot;Tales from the Crapper&quot;, which cost $250,000 despite most of the footage being completely unusable. India Allen, one of the producers, backed out of the film halfway through, and sued Troma, citing breach of contract, slander, sexual harassment, trade slander, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Kaufman supervised a reshoot in an attempt to salvage the film, dividing the footage into two parts and recasting the film as a double feature. &quot;Tales from the Crapper&quot; was released on DVD in September 2004.

Currently, Troma produces and acquires independent films, despite financial hardships and limitations. Troma Films has distributed many films from third parties including Trey Parker&#x27;s &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot;. Lloyd encourages independent filmmaking, making cameo appearances in many low-budget horror films, occasionally without fee. Among his more recent appearances is in former collaborator James Gunn&#x27;s directing debut, &quot;Slither&quot;, and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;.

Kaufman&#x27;s long-time editor Gabriel Friedman co-directed and wrote the screenplay to his follow-up film, &quot;&quot;, a musical zom-com which made its official New York premiere on May 9, 2008 (although the film had previewed numerous times on single screens for over a year). The film opened to positive reviews from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; and was released in 2006 in theaters and in 2008 on DVD.

During the winter of 2010/2011, Troma produced a feature-length film &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot;, which Kaufman calls &quot;a response film to Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;. The film was written and directed by the Canadian filmmaking team Astron-6, debuting October 21, 2011, at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival where it took home the top prize of BEST FILM, as well as five other awards. In 2012 &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot; was featured on the cover of &quot;Rue Morgue&quot; magazine and won Best Feature Film, Best Director, Best Male Performance, and Best Special Effects at The Fantastic Planet/A Night of Horror International film festival. This is rare for a film that cost only ten thousand dollars to make. On October 31, 2012, &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot; was refused classification in Australia, which makes it effectively illegal to sell or exhibit the film. A second censored version was eventually passed with an R18+ rating.

In August 2012, Troma released over 100 of its back catalog films on YouTube, many for free, some for 48-hour paid viewing. However, their YouTube channel was terminated in 2020 and 2023 for not meeting community standards, but has since been reinstated. 

==Hollywood==
On April 7, 2010, Kaufman confirmed that a PG-13 remake of &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; had been greenlit and was to be produced by Akiva Goldsman. It actually has not been the first attempt at a general audience-friendly version of the franchise, as &quot;Make Your Own Damn Movie&quot; identified a previous deal with New Line in the early 1990s for a live-action take on the Toxic Crusaders.

Another 1980s Troma classic, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; (1980), was also to receive a remake, expected to be directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and produced by Brett Ratner. At the time, Kaufman also said that he was negotiating a deal for a remake of &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Troma and Starz Entertainment entered into an agreement for the production of &quot;Return to Nuke Em High&quot; as a two-volume title. The first volume was released in theaters and on home video. The second volume, delayed due to funding issues, was stated on its Kickstarter website in January 2017 to be nearing completion.

==Troma Now==
In 2015, Troma launched a streaming service called Troma Now, which offers many of the films distributed by Troma to subscribers. The service offers subscribers a free trial month, after which they need to pay a monthly fee of US$4.99.

==Other work==
=== TromaDance ===
Troma holds an annual Tromadance Festival, originally taking place in Park City, Utah at the same time as the Sundance Festival to accentuate their true independence from the mainstream. The festival screens submitted movies from independent filmmakers from around the world, the best of which are usually released on DVD by Troma or compiled in the Best of Tromadance series. In parallel, Troma acts as adviser to aspiring filmmakers with Kaufman teaching classes, contributing cameos and often releasing the finished films on DVD.

2009 marked the last time Tromadance was held in Utah; the festival was subsequently relocated to Asbury Park, New Jersey. In 2014, the festival moved to New York City, and since 2020 has been held at The Mahoning Drive-In Theater.

=== Kaufman&#x27;s books ===
Kaufman has also had some success with several non-fiction books and a novelization of &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot;. Released in 1998, &quot;All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from The Toxic Avenger&quot; is an autobiography of sorts co-written with James Gunn. This book chronicles the history of the company, its films, and its iconic figurehead. Kaufman continued to draw on his experiences as Troma chief in the &quot;how-to&quot; filmmaking books &quot;Make Your Own Damn Movie!&quot;, &quot;Direct Your Own Damn Movie!&quot;, &quot;Produce Your Own Damn Movie!&quot; and &quot;Sell Your Own Damn Movie!&quot;. A DVD box set has been released to coincide with release of each of the first three books. In the video series, Kaufman interviews famous and infamous filmmakers about various filmmaking subjects.

In 2006, a novelization of &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; was released. It was co-written by Kaufman and long-time Troma employee Adam Jahnke.

Mathew Klickstein&#x27;s 2025 book &quot;Lloyd Kaufman:Interviews&quot;, published as part of the University Press of Mississippi&#x27;s long-running Conversations With Filmmakers series, collects more than five decades of Kaufman interviews and chronicles the intimate details of the story of Troma.

==Films formerly distributed==
Some titles which have at one time, or another, been distributed by Troma Inc. have left the catalog. For instance, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; was originally released by Troma&#x27;s subsidiary 50th Street Films, but only for a short time, and only for U.S. theatrical release. Others were briefly licensed for distribution on VHS such as &quot;Femme Fontaine Killer Babe for the C.I.A.&quot; which was one of Troma Team Video&#x27;s original launch titles along with &quot;Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.&quot; and &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;em High Part III: The Good, The Bad and The Subhumanoid&quot;.

<doc id="105412" wikidata="Q1018724" url="?curid=105412" title="Byte order mark">
<text>The byte-order mark (BOM) is a particular usage of the special Unicode character code, , whose appearance as a magic number at the start of a text stream can signal several things to a program reading the text:
* the byte order, or endianness, of the text stream in the cases of 16-bit and 32-bit encodings;
* the fact that the text stream&#x27;s encoding is Unicode, to a high level of confidence;
* which Unicode character encoding is used.

BOM use is optional. Its presence interferes with the use of UTF-8 by software that does not expect non-ASCII bytes at the start of a file but that could otherwise handle the text stream.

Unicode can be encoded in units of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit integers. For the 16- and 32-bit representations, a computer receiving text from arbitrary sources needs to know which byte order the integers are encoded in. The BOM is encoded in the same scheme as the rest of the document and becomes a  Unicode code point if its bytes are swapped. Hence, the process accessing the text can examine these first few bytes to determine the endianness, without requiring some contract or metadata outside of the text stream itself. Generally the receiving computer will swap the bytes to its own endianness, if necessary, and would no longer need the BOM for processing.

The byte sequence of the BOM differs per Unicode encoding (including ones outside the Unicode standard such as UTF-7, see table below), and none of the sequences is likely to appear at the start of text streams stored in other encodings. Therefore, placing an encoded BOM at the start of a text stream can indicate that the text is Unicode and identify the encoding scheme used. This use of the BOM is called a &quot;Unicode signature&quot;.

==Usage==
The BOM is, simply, the Unicode codepoint codice_1, encoded in the current encoding. A text file beginning with the bytes codice_2 suggests that the file is encoded in big-endian UTF-16.

The name ZWNBSP should be used if the BOM appears in the middle of a data stream. Unicode says it should be interpreted as a normal codepoint (namely a word joiner), not as a BOM. Since Unicode 3.2, this usage has been deprecated in favor of codice_3.

The Unicode 1.0 name for this codepoint is also codice_4

===UTF-8===
The UTF-8 representation of the BOM is the (hexadecimal) byte sequence codice_5.

The Unicode Standard permits the BOM in UTF-8, but does not require or recommend its use. UTF-8 always has the same byte order, so its only use in UTF-8 is to signal at the start that the text stream is encoded in UTF-8, or that it was converted to UTF-8 from a stream that contained an optional BOM. The standard also does not recommend removing a BOM when it is there, so that round-tripping between encodings does not lose information, and so that code that relies on it continues to work. The IETF recommends that if a protocol either (a) always uses UTF-8, or (b) has some other way to indicate what encoding is being used, then it &quot;SHOULD forbid use of U+FEFF as a signature.&quot; An example of not following this recommendation is the IETF Syslog protocol which requires text to be in UTF-8 and also requires the BOM.

Not using a BOM allows text to be backwards-compatible with software designed for extended ASCII. For instance many programming languages permit non-ASCII bytes in string literals but not at the start of the file.

A BOM is unnecessary for detecting UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is a sparse encoding: a large fraction of possible byte combinations do not result in valid UTF-8 text. Binary data and text in any other encoding are likely to contain byte sequences that are invalid as UTF-8, so existence of such invalid sequences indicates the file is not UTF-8, while lack of invalid sequences is a very strong indication the text &quot;is&quot; UTF-8. Practically the only exception is text containing only ASCII-range bytes, as this may be a non-ASCII 7-bit encoding, but this is unlikely in any modern data and even then the difference from ASCII is minor (such as changing &#x27;\&#x27; to &#x27;¥&#x27;).

Microsoft compilers and interpreters, and many pieces of software on Microsoft Windows such as Notepad (prior to Windows 10 Build 1903) treat the BOM as a required magic number rather than use heuristics. These tools add a BOM when saving text as UTF-8, and cannot interpret UTF-8 unless the BOM is present or the file contains only ASCII. Windows PowerShell (up to 5.1) will add a BOM when it saves UTF-8 XML documents. However, PowerShell Core 6 has added a codice_6 switch on some cmdlets called utf8NoBOM so that document can be saved without BOM. Google Docs also adds a BOM when converting a document to a plain text file for download.

===UTF-16===
In UTF-16, a BOM (codice_7) may be placed as the first bytes of a file or character stream to indicate the endianness (byte order) of all the 16-bit code units of the file or stream. If an attempt is made to read this stream with the wrong endianness, the bytes will be swapped, thus delivering the character codice_8, which is defined by Unicode as a &quot;&quot; that should never appear in the text.

* If the 16-bit units are represented in big-endian byte order (&quot;UTF-16BE&quot;), the BOM is the (hexadecimal) byte sequence codice_9
* If the 16-bit units use little-endian order (&quot;UTF-16LE&quot;), the BOM is the (hexadecimal) byte sequence codice_10

For the IANA registered charsets UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE, a byte-order mark should not be used because the names of these character sets already determine the byte order.

If there is no BOM, it is possible to guess whether the text is UTF-16 and its byte order by searching for ASCII characters (i.e. a 0 byte adjacent to a byte in the 0x20-0x7E range, also 0x0A and 0x0D for CR and LF). A large number (i.e. far higher than random chance) in the same order is a very good indication of UTF-16 and whether the 0 is in the even or odd bytes indicates the byte order. However, this can result in &quot;both&quot; false positives and false negatives.

Clause D98 of conformance (section 3.10) of the Unicode standard states, &quot;The UTF-16 encoding scheme may or may not begin with a BOM. However, when there is no BOM, and in the absence of a higher-level protocol, the byte order of the UTF-16 encoding scheme is big-endian.&quot; Whether or not a higher-level protocol is in force is open to interpretation. Files local to a computer for which the native byte ordering is little-endian, for example, might be argued to be encoded as UTF-16LE implicitly. Therefore, the presumption of big-endian is widely ignored. The W3C/WHATWG encoding standard used in HTML5 specifies that content labelled either &quot;utf-16&quot; or &quot;utf-16le&quot; are to be interpreted as little-endian &quot;to deal with deployed content&quot;. However, if a byte-order mark is present, then that BOM is to be treated as &quot;more authoritative than anything else&quot;.

===UTF-32===
Although a BOM could be used with UTF-32, this encoding is rarely used for transmission. Otherwise the same rules as for UTF-16 are applicable.

The BOM for little-endian UTF-32 is the same pattern as a little-endian UTF-16 BOM followed by a UTF-16 NUL character, an unusual example of the BOM being the same pattern in two different encodings. Programmers using the BOM to identify the encoding will have to decide whether UTF-32 or UTF-16 with a NUL first character is more likely.

==Byte-order marks by encoding==
This table illustrates how the BOM is represented as a byte sequence in various encodings and how those sequences might appear in a text editor that is interpreting each byte as a legacy encoding (Windows-1252 and caret notation for the C0 controls):

<text>Trainspotting is a 1996 British black comedy drama film directed by Danny Boyle, and starring Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Robert Carlyle and Kelly Macdonald in her film debut. Based on the 1993 novel by Irvine Welsh, the film was released in the United Kingdom on 23 February 1996.

The film follows a group of heroin addicts in an economically depressed area of Edinburgh and their passage through life. Beyond drug addiction, other themes in the film include an exploration of the urban poverty and squalor in Edinburgh.

&quot;Trainspotting&quot; was released to critical acclaim, and is regarded by many critics as one of the best films of the 1990s. The film was ranked tenth by the British Film Institute (BFI) in its list of Top 100 British films of the 20th century. In 2004, the film was voted the best Scottish film of all time in a general public poll. A 2017 poll, which consisted of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine, ranked it the tenth best British film ever. A sequel, &quot;T2 Trainspotting&quot;, was released in January 2017, with TriStar Pictures distributing it.

==Plot==

Mark Renton, a 26-year-old unemployed heroin addict living with his parents in Leith, regularly takes drugs with his &quot;friends&quot;: treacherous, womanising James Bond fanatic Simon &quot;Sick Boy&quot; Williamson; docile and bumbling Daniel &quot;Spud&quot; Murphy; and Swanney—&quot;Mother Superior&quot;—their dealer. Renton&#x27;s other friends include aggressive alcoholic psychopath Francis &quot;Franco&quot; Begbie, and honest footballer Tommy Mackenzie, who both abstain from drug use, warning him about his dangerous drug habit. 

Tiring of his reckless lifestyle, Renton attempts to wean himself off heroin with a bare room, foodstuffs, and opium suppositories from dodgy dealer Mikey Forrester. Developing diarrhoea, he has to relieve himself in the disgusting toilet of a betting shop, then imagines swimming in the filthy water as he retrieves the suppositories.

Renton attempts to lead a &quot;useful and fulfilling&quot; life away from heroin. This consists of meeting Sick Boy in a park where he uses an air gun to incite a stranger&#x27;s dog to attack its owner, supplying Spud with amphetamine for a job interview that backfires, and stealing a sex tape of Tommy and his girlfriend, Lizzy. 

At The Volcano nightclub, Renton notices his cessation of heroin use has increased his libido. So, he seduces Diane Coulston, returning to hers to have sex. The following morning, he is horrified to learn that she is underaged and lives with her parents, whom Renton mistakes for her flatmates. Diane threatens to blackmail him for statutory rape if he does not continue the relationship.

After several unsuccessful attempts to reintegrate into society, Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud relapse into heroin use; Tommy also begins to join them after Lizzy dumps him, thanks to the actions of an unknowing Renton. Despite the group’s shock, grief, and horror regarding the negligence-induced death of Dawn, the infant daughter of Sick Boy and Allison, they still do not quit using. 

When Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud are caught shoplifting, Sick Boy narrowly escapes. Arrested, Spud receives a six-month custodial sentence at HMP Saughton, and Renton narrowly avoids jail by entering a drug rehabilitation programme where he is given methadone to help him. However, Renton quickly relapses and nearly dies of a heroin overdose at Swanney&#x27;s. 

Returning home after his revival at the hospital, Renton&#x27;s parents lock him in his childhood bedroom and force him to go cold turkey. Following severe withdrawal punctuated by hallucinations of his friends and visions of Dawn crawling on the ceiling, Renton is released upon the condition of an HIV/AIDS test. Despite years of sharing syringes with other addicts, he tests negative.

Now clean but bored and lacking meaning in his life, Renton visits Tommy, who is now severely addicted to heroin and is HIV-positive. On Diane&#x27;s advice, Renton moves to London and works as a property letting agent. He begins to enjoy his new life of sobriety in London and corresponds with Diane, who updates him on home developments. 

To Renton&#x27;s shock and frustration Begbie, wanted for a failed armed robbery, finds him, taking refuge in his apartment. Sick Boy, now trying to be a pimp and drug dealer, soon joins them. The freeloaders later attack two of Renton&#x27;s clientele (at a supposedly impossible-to-sell property where Renton has sent them to get peace), so he loses his job. The trio returns to Edinburgh to avoid police attention and for Tommy&#x27;s funeral, who has died of AIDS-related toxoplasmosis.

Following the funeral, Sick Boy asks Renton, Begbie, and Spud (recently released from prison) for help in buying two kilograms of pure heroin from Mikey Forrester, for only £4,000, to sell on, with Renton needing to supply the remaining £2,000 asking price. He reluctantly covers it after Begbie threatens him. 

So, the four return to London to sell the heroin to a dealer for £16,000. As they celebrate in a pub, Renton secretly suggests to Spud that they take off with the money. He, motivated by fear and loyalty, refuses. Sick Boy indicates he would happily do so, and Begbie brutally beats a man after a minor accident. 

Concluding that Begbie and Sick Boy are too volatile, Renton quietly steals the bag of money and leaves the following morning. Spud sees, but chooses not to warn the others. Renton leaves £4,000 in a left-luggage locker for Spud, who &quot;never hurt anybody&quot;. 

Begbie, discovering Renton and the money gone, enragedly destroys their hotel room, prompting the police to arrest him as Sick Boy and Spud flee. Spud discreetly claims his share of the money, and Renton walks away to his new life.

==Style and themes==
Music has great importance in Danny Boyle&#x27;s films, as evident by the best-selling soundtracks for &quot;Trainspotting&quot; and &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, both of which feature many pop and punk rock artists. In Boyle&#x27;s view, songs can be &quot;amazing things to use because they obviously bring a lot of baggage with them. They may have painful associations, and so they inter-breathe with the material you&#x27;re using&quot;.

The combination of images and music with the setting of the criminal underworld has drawn comparisons to &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and the films of Quentin Tarantino, that had created a certain type of &quot;90s indie cinema&quot; which &quot;strove to dazzle the viewer with self-conscious cleverness and empty shock tactics&quot;. This affected the shooting style of the film, which features &quot;wildly imaginative&quot; and &quot;downright hallucinatory&quot; visual imagery, achieved through a mix of &quot;a handheld, hurtling camera&quot;, jump cuts, zoom shots, freeze frames and wide angles. This vigorous style contributed to the &quot;breathless&quot; pace that Boyle&#x27;s films have been associated with.

For the look of the film, Boyle was influenced by the colours of Francis Bacon&#x27;s paintings, which represented &quot;a sort of in-between land – part reality, part fantasy&quot;. The scene where Renton (McGregor) dives into a toilet is a reference to Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===
Producer Andrew Macdonald read Irvine Welsh&#x27;s book on a plane in December 1993, and felt that it could be made into a film. He turned it on to director Danny Boyle and writer John Hodge in February 1994. Boyle was excited by its potential to be the &quot;most energetic film you&#x27;ve ever seen — about something that ultimately ends up in purgatory or worse&quot;. Hodge read it and made it his goal to &quot;produce a screenplay which would seem to have a beginning, a middle and an end, would last 90 minutes and would convey at least some of the spirit and the content of the book&quot;. Boyle convinced Welsh to let them option the rights to his book by writing him a letter stating that Hodge and Macdonald were &quot;the two most important Scotsmen since Kenny Dalglish and Alex Ferguson&quot;. Welsh remembered that originally the people wanting to option his book &quot;wanted to make a po-faced piece of social realism like &quot;Christiane F&quot; or &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;&quot;. He was impressed that Boyle, Hodge and Macdonald wanted everyone to see the film and &quot;not just the arthouse audience&quot;. In October 1994, Hodge, Boyle and Macdonald spent a lot of time discussing which chapters of the book would and would not translate into film. Hodge finished the first draft by December. Macdonald secured financing from Channel 4, a British television station known for funding independent films.

===Casting===
Pre-production began in April 1995. Ewan McGregor was cast after impressing Boyle and Macdonald with his work on their previous film, &quot;Shallow Grave&quot;. According to Boyle, for the role of Renton, they wanted the quality of Michael Caine&#x27;s character Alfie Elkins in &quot;Alfie&quot; and Malcolm McDowell&#x27;s character Alex DeLarge in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;repulsive ... with charm &#x27;that makes you feel deeply ambiguous about what he&#x27;s doing&#x27;.&quot; McGregor shaved his head and lost 2 stone (12.7 kilograms) for the film. Ewen Bremner had played Renton in the stage adaptation of &quot;Trainspotting&quot; and agreed to play the role of Spud, saying he felt the characters &quot;were part of my heritage&quot;. Boyle had heard about Jonny Lee Miller playing an American in the film &quot;Hackers&quot; and was impressed when he auditioned by doing a Sean Connery accent. For the role of Begbie, Boyle considered casting Christopher Eccleston for his resemblance to how he imagined the character in the novel, but asked Robert Carlyle instead. Carlyle was initially hesitant, believing he was too short to play the character, but Boyle convinced him by telling him, &quot;No, small psychos are better.&quot; Carlyle said, &quot;I&#x27;ve met loads of Begbies in my time. Wander round Glasgow on Saturday night and you&#x27;ve a good chance of running into Begbie.&quot; For the role of Diane, Boyle wanted an unknown actress so audiences would not realise that a 19-year-old was playing a 15-year-old. The filmmakers sent flyers to nightclubs and boutiques and approached people on the street, eventually hiring Kelly Macdonald. The casting of Keith Allen as the Dealer was a reference to his role in &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; with the implication being that he plays the same character in both.

===Pre-production===
McGregor read books about crack and heroin to prepare for the role. He also went to Glasgow and met people from the Calton Athletic Recovery Group, an organisation of recovering heroin addicts, who play the opposing football team in the opening credits. He was taught how to cook up heroin with a spoon using glucose powder. McGregor considered injecting heroin to better understand the character, but eventually decided against it. Many of the book&#x27;s stories and characters were dropped to create a cohesive script of adequate length. Danny Boyle had his actors prepare by making them watch older films about rebellious youths like &quot;The Hustler&quot; and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

The main cast of the film attended Calton Athletic Recovery Group&#x27;s self-help meetings to prepare for their roles in the film. The Calton Athletic Football Club appears in a cameo scene at the beginning of the film.

===Principal photography===
&quot;Trainspotting&quot; was shot in mid-1995 over seven weeks on a budget of £1.5million with the cast and crew working out of an abandoned cigarette factory in Glasgow.
Due to time constraints and a tight budget, most scenes were done in one take, which contributed to the grungy look of the film. For example, when Renton sinks into the floor after overdosing on heroin, the crew built a platform above a trap door and lowered the actor down. The faeces in the &#x27;Worst Toilet in Scotland&#x27; scene was made from chocolate.

Although set in Edinburgh, almost all of the film was shot in Glasgow, apart from the opening scenes which were shot in Edinburgh, and the final scenes which were shot in London.

Locations in the film include:
* The opening scene of Renton and Spud being chased by security for shoplifting is shot in Edinburgh, on Princes Street and Calton Road under Regent Bridge.
* The park where Sick Boy and Renton discuss James Bond, Sean Connery and &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; is Rouken Glen Park in Giffnock, near Glasgow. The park was also the site of the grave in Boyle&#x27;s previous film, &quot;Shallow Grave&quot;.
* Corrour railway station is the setting for the &quot;great outdoors&quot; scene in the film, where Tommy suggests the group climb Leum Uilleim.
* The scenes where they do their drug deal take place in Paddington. The scene where they parody the cover of the Beatles album &quot;Abbey Road&quot; takes place as they walk out of Smallbrook Mews across Craven Road to the Royal Eagle, 26–30 Craven Road, Paddington.
* The school attended by Diane is Jordanhill in Glasgow&#x27;s West End.

==Soundtracks==

The &quot;Trainspotting&quot; soundtracks were two best-selling albums of music based on the film. The first is a collection of songs featured in the film, while the second includes those left out from the first soundtrack and extra songs that inspired the filmmakers during production.

The soundtrack for &quot;Trainspotting&quot; has gone on to become a pop culture phenomenon. Nearly all of the score is pre-recorded music from existing artists. This score is divided into three distinct groups, all representing a different eras and styles: The first being pop music from the 1970s, by artists such as Lou Reed and Iggy Pop; who are all musicians closely associated with drug use and are referred to throughout the original novel. The second group is the music from the Britpop era in the 1990s, with bands Blur and Pulp. Finally, there is the techno-dance music from the 1990s, including Underworld, Bedrock and Ice MC. Danny Boyle approached Oasis about contributing a song to the soundtrack but Noel Gallagher turned down the opportunity due to him mistakenly believing it would be a film about actual trainspotters.

Through the years, acclaim for the soundtrack has been sustained. In 2007, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; ranked the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; original soundtrack at number 7 for best motion picture soundtrack in history. Additionally, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; soundtrack as 17th on their 100 best movie soundtracks list. In 2013, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it as the 13th best soundtrack in their 25 best soundtracks. In 2015, &quot;New Musical Express&quot; praised it as a &quot;perfect snapshot of 1996 music.&quot;

1996 saw a drastic change in British music with the rise of popularity for Britpop, although old-fashioned pop was still firmly rooted in British culture. With Oasis dominating the singles chart and the Spice Girls on the rise, the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; soundtrack aimed to champion the alternative music legacy of 1996 Britain with a focus on presenting electronic music on equal footing with rock music in a way that had never been done before.

==Release==
===Marketing and theatrical release===
MacDonald worked with Miramax Films to sell the film as a British &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, flooding the market with postcards, posters, books, soundtrack albums and a revamped music video for &quot;Lust for Life&quot; by Iggy Pop directed by Boyle.

Prior to its release in the United States, Miramax, the film&#x27;s US distributor, requested that some of the dialogue be dubbed so the film would be easier to understand for American viewers unfamiliar with Scottish slang and British slang in general.

PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, the company responsible for the distribution of the film, launched a publicity campaign of half as much as the film&#x27;s production costs (£850,000) in the UK alone, making the film stand out more as a Hollywood blockbuster rather than a smaller European production.

&quot;Trainspotting&quot; was able to portray itself as British and as an &#x27;exotic&#x27; element to the international market while also staying relevant to the American public, making it an international success in its marketing.

=== Home media ===
The film was released on VHS after its theatrical release. It was released on DVD on 25 March 1998, and on Blu-ray on 13 September 2011. A remastered version of the film was released by The Criterion Collection on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray on January 30, 2024.

==Reception==
&quot;Trainspotting&quot; was screened at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival but was shown out of competition, according to the filmmakers, due to its subject. It went on to become the festival&#x27;s one unqualified critical and popular hit.

The film had previews in the UK on 17 screens, grossing £18,970, before opening on 23 February 1996 in a platform release on 57 screens in the West End of London, Scotland and Ireland, grossing £532,950 in its opening weekend and placing fifth at the UK box office. It was the number one film in London. It expanded nationwide to 245 screens in its third week of release and was the number one film in the UK with a gross of £1,422,906 for the weekend.

By the time it opened in North America, on 19 July 1996, the film had grossed more than $18million in Britain. It initially opened in eight theatres in the U.S. and Canada and on its first weekend grossed $33,000 per screen. The film expanded to 357 screens and made $16.4million in North America, one of the biggest grossing films of 1996 in limited release. &quot;Trainspotting&quot; was the highest-grossing British film of 1996, and at the time it was the fourth highest grossing British film in history. The film grossed £12million in the UK and $72million internationally. Based on a cost-to-return ratio, &quot;Trainspotting&quot; was the most profitable film of the year.

===Critical reception===
The film has an approval rating of 90% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 95 reviews collected by the site, with an average score of 8.30/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A brutal, often times funny, other times terrifying portrayal of drug addiction in Edinburgh. Not for the faint of heart, but well worth viewing as a realistic and entertaining reminder of the horrors of drug use&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Derek Malcolm gave the film credit for tapping into the youth subculture of the time and felt that it was &quot;acted out with a freedom of expression that&#x27;s often astonishing.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave the film five out of five stars and described the film as &quot;something Britain can be proud of and Hollywood must be afraid of. If we Brits can make movies this good about subjects this horrific, what chance does Tinseltown have?&quot;

American film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and praised its portrayal of addicts&#x27; experiences with each other. In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kenneth Turan wrote, &quot;in McGregor ... the film has an actor whose magnetism monopolizes our attention no matter what&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an &quot;A&quot; rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, &quot;Like Scorsese and Tarantino, Boyle uses pop songs as rhapsodic mood enhancers, though in his own ravey-hypnotic style. Whether he&#x27;s staging a fumbly sex montage to Sleeper&#x27;s version of &quot;Atomic&quot; or having Renton go cold turkey to the ominous slow build of Underworld&#x27;s &quot;Dark and Long&quot; ... &quot;Trainspotting&quot; keeps us wired to the pulse of its characters&#x27; passions&quot;. In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;&quot;Trainspotting&quot; doesn&#x27;t have much narrative holding it together. Nor does it really have the dramatic range to cope with such wild extremes. Most of it sticks to the same moderate pitch, with entertainment value enhanced by Mr. Boyle&#x27;s savvy use of wide angles, bright colours, attractively clean compositions and a dynamic pop score&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Peter Travers wrote, &quot;the film&#x27;s flash can&#x27;t disguise the emptiness of these blasted lives. &quot;Trainspotting&quot; is 90 minutes of raw power that Boyle and a bang-on cast inject right into the vein&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe wrote, &quot;Without a doubt, this is the most provocative, enjoyable pop-cultural experience since &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum, in his review for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, wrote, &quot;Like &quot;Twister&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot;, this movie is a theme-park ride – though it&#x27;s a much better one, basically a series of youthful thrills, spills, chills, and swerves rather than a story intended to say very much&quot;.

The film&#x27;s release sparked controversy in some countries, including Britain, Australia and the United States, as to whether or not it promoted and romanticised drug use. U.S. Senator Bob Dole accused it of moral depravity and glorifying drug use during the 1996 U.S. presidential campaign, although he later admitted that he had not seen the film. Producer of the film Andrew Macdonald responded to these claims in a BBC interview stating &quot;we were determined to show why people took drugs ... you had to show that it was fun and that it was awful&quot; to which Boyle adds &quot;It&#x27;s the music and humour that makes people feel it&#x27;s glamorising drugs.&quot; Despite the controversy, it was widely praised and received a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay in that year&#x27;s Academy Awards. &quot;Time&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Trainspotting&quot; as the third best film of 1996.

===Legacy===
The film had an immediate effect on popular culture. In 1999, &quot;Trainspotting&quot; was ranked in the tenth spot by the British Film Institute (BFI) in its list of Top 100 British films of all time, while in 2004 the magazine &quot;Total Film&quot; named it the fourth greatest British film of all time. That same year, Channel 4 named it as the greatest British film of all time. &quot;The Observer&quot; polled several filmmakers and film critics who voted it the best British film in the last 25 years. In 2004, the film was voted the best Scottish film of all time by the public in a poll for &quot;The List&quot; magazine. &quot;Trainspotting&quot; has developed a cult following. It was recognised as an important film during the 1990s British cultural tour de force known as Cool Britannia. It was also featured in the documentary &quot;Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop.&quot;

The film title is a reference to a scene in the book where Begbie and Renton meet &quot;an auld drunkard&quot; who turns out to be Begbie&#x27;s estranged father, in the disused Leith Central railway station, which they are using as a toilet. He asks them if they are &quot;trainspottin. This scene is later included as a flashback in &quot;T2 Trainspotting&quot;.

The music video for the 2019 song &quot;Doorman&quot; by English rapper Slowthai contains several references to the film.

===Awards===
&quot;Trainspotting&quot; was nominated for two British Academy Film Awards at the 49th British Academy Film Awards in 1996, Best British Film and John Hodge for Best Adapted Screenplay. Hodge won in his category. Hodge also won Best Screenplay from the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; British Film Awards. The film won the Golden Space Needle (the award for Best Film) at the 1996 Seattle International Film Festival. Ewan McGregor tied with Ian McKellen for &quot;Richard III&quot; for Best British Actor of the Year at the London Film Critics Circle Awards 1996 for his work in this film as well as &quot;Brassed Off&quot;, &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;The Pillow Book&quot;. McGregor was also named Best Actor at the BAFTA Scotland Awards, and by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine. Hodge was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 69th Academy Awards but lost to Billy Bob Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Sling Blade&quot;.

==Sequel==

Boyle had declared his wish to make a sequel to &quot;Trainspotting&quot; which would take place nine years after the original film, based on Irvine Welsh&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Porno&quot;. He was reportedly waiting until the original actors themselves aged visibly enough to portray the same characters, ravaged by time; Boyle joked that the natural vanity of actors would make it a long wait. Ewan McGregor stated in an interview that he would return for a sequel, saying &quot;I&#x27;m totally up for it. I&#x27;d be so chuffed to be back on set with everybody and I think it would be an extraordinary experience.&quot;

On 6 May 2014, during a BBC Radio interview with Richard Bacon, Welsh confirmed that he had spent a week with Boyle, Andrew Macdonald and the creative team behind &quot;Trainspotting&quot; to discuss the sequel. Welsh stated that the meeting was to &quot;explore the story and script ideas. We&#x27;re not interested in doing something that will trash the legacy of &quot;Trainspotting&quot;. ... We want to do something that&#x27;s very fresh and contemporary.&quot; Welsh did not however confirm any kind of timeline for the film, unlike Boyle&#x27;s comments about wanting the film to come out in 2016.

In a newspaper interview with &quot;The Scotsman&quot; on 17 November 2014, Welsh said that McGregor and Boyle had resolved their differences and had held meetings about the film, saying &quot;I know Danny and Ewan are back in touch with each other again. There are others in the cast who&#x27;ve had a rocky road, but now also reconciled. With the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; sequel the attention is going to be even more intense this time round because the first was such a great movie—and Danny&#x27;s such a colossus now. We&#x27;re all protective of the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; legacy and we want to make a film that adds to that legacy and doesn&#x27;t take away from it.&quot;

In a September 2015 interview with ComingSoon.net, Boyle said that a script for the sequel had been written, and that filming would take place between May and June 2016, in the hope of releasing the film that year to commemorate &quot;Trainspotting&#x27;s&quot; 20th anniversary.

&quot;T2 Trainspotting&quot; was released in the UK on 27 January 2017, and worldwide in February and March 2017. It received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $42.1 million against a production budget of $18 million. It is a black comedy-drama film, directed by Boyle and written by John Hodge. Set in and around Edinburgh, it is based on characters created by Welsh in his 1993 novel &quot;Trainspotting&quot; and its 2002 follow-up &quot;Porno&quot;. &quot;T2&quot; stars the original ensemble cast, including leads Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, and Robert Carlyle, with Shirley Henderson, James Cosmo, and Kelly Macdonald. The film features a new character, Veronika, played by Anjela Nedyalkova, and includes clips, music, and archive sound from the first film.

<doc id="105435" wikidata="Q2143703" url="?curid=105435" title="The Crickets">
<text>The Crickets were an American rock and roll band from Lubbock, Texas, formed by singer-songwriter Buddy Holly in January 1957. Their first hit record, &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;, released in May 1957, peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 chart on September 16, 1957. The sleeve of their first album, &quot;The &quot;Chirping&quot; Crickets&quot;, shows the band line-up at the time: Holly on lead vocals and lead guitar, Niki Sullivan on rhythm guitar, Jerry Allison on drums, and Joe B. Mauldin on bass. The Crickets helped set the template for subsequent rock bands, such as the Beatles, with their guitar-bass-drums line-up, performing their own material. After Holly&#x27;s death in 1959, the band continued to tour and record into the 1960s and beyond with other band members through to the 21st century.

==History==
===Formation===

Holly had been making demo recordings with local musician friends since 1954. Sonny Curtis, Jerry Allison, and Larry Welborn participated in these sessions. In 1956, Holly&#x27;s band, then known informally as Buddy and the Two Tones (Holly with Sonny Curtis and Don Guess; posthumous releases refer to the Three Tunes), recorded an album&#x27;s worth of rockabilly numbers in Nashville, Tennessee, for Decca. The records were not more than mildly successful, and the band did not achieve financial success until 1957, when the producer and recording engineer Norman Petty recorded Holly&#x27;s sessions in Clovis, New Mexico.

Holly had already recorded for another label under his own name, so to avoid legal problems he needed a new name for his group. As the Crickets recalled in John Goldrosen&#x27;s book &quot;Buddy Holly – His Life and Music&quot;, they were inspired by other groups named after birds. They were then considering insect-centered names, apparently unaware of the Bronx R&amp;B vocal group the Crickets, who recorded for Jay-Dee. They almost chose the name &quot;Beetles&quot;; years later, the Beatles chose their name partly in homage to the Crickets.

The Crickets were lead guitarist and vocalist Buddy Holly, drummer Jerry Allison, bassist Joe B. Mauldin, and rhythm guitarist Niki Sullivan. Sullivan dropped out after a little more than one year to resume his education. The Crickets, now a trio, continued to make stage and TV appearances and recorded more songs, many composed by the band members.

===Early success===

In 1957, Norman Petty arranged for the Crickets&#x27; recordings to be marketed under two names. The solo vocals were released as being performed by Buddy Holly, and the songs with dubbed backing vocals were issued as being sung by the Crickets. Petty reasoned correctly that disc jockeys might be reluctant to program a single artist too heavily but would play records by two seemingly different groups. Some disc jockeys referred to the band as &quot;Buddy Holly and the Crickets&quot;, but record labels never used this wording until after Holly&#x27;s death.

In 1958, Holly broke with producer Petty and moved to New York to be more involved with the publishing and recording businesses. Allison and Mauldin chose not to move and returned to Lubbock. Holly now recorded under his own name with the studio musicians Tommy Allsup and Carl Bunch. Waylon Jennings toured with him shortly after Holly left the Crickets. Allison and Mauldin looked forward to rejoining Holly after he returned from a winter tour through the northern Midwest. In the meantime, Mauldin, Allison, and Sonny Curtis (a friend and collaborator of Holly&#x27;s) began recording new songs as the Crickets, with vocals by Earl Sinks. While they were recording, it was announced that Holly had died in a plane crash while on tour.

===After Holly&#x27;s death===

The Crickets, now with vocalist Earl Sinks, went on performing after Holly&#x27;s death. David Box, a native of Lubbock, Texas, who sang in a manner similar to Holly, joined the group as lead vocalist for their 1960 single &quot;Dont Cha Know&quot;/&quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;, released as Coral 62238 after the departure of Sinks. Curtis was not in the band, as he was completing military service. Box, who had left the group in 1960, died in a charter plane crash on October 23, 1964, while touring as a solo singer.

In April 1960, the Crickets backed the Everly Brothers on their first UK concert tour but were not billed as their backing group. By 1962, the Crickets consisted of Curtis, Allison, Glen D. Hardin, and Jerry Naylor. That year, the Crickets&#x27; version of the Gerry Goffin–Carole King song &quot;Don&#x27;t Ever Change&quot; (Liberty Records), featuring Naylor on lead vocals, reached the top five in the British single charts. Also in 1962 they released &quot;Bobby Vee Meets the Crickets&quot;, an album with Bobby Vee on lead vocals. For their 1962 UK tour, Allison was temporarily out of the group because of commitments with the U.S. Air Force.

In 1963, the Crickets hit the UK top 40 twice more, with the singles &quot;My Little Girl&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Try to Change Me&quot;, the last of their recordings to reach the charts. The band continued to record. In 1964, the Crickets issued their version of the surf rock song &quot;California Sun&quot; for their album of the same title. In 1970, Jerry Allison and Sonny Curtis performed backing vocals for Eric Clapton for his first solo album titled &quot;Eric Clapton&quot;.

Personnel changes were made over the years, with Curtis and Allison remaining relative constants. For the 1971 album &quot;Rockin&#x27; 50s Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot; (which consisted mostly of remakes of Holly-era material), the group consisted of Curtis, Allison and Doug Gilmore. For the 1973 album &quot;Bubblegum, Bop, Ballad and Boogies&quot;, the line-up featured Curtis, Allison, Hardin and bassist Ric Grech. Steven Krikorian, later to record as the new wave artist Tonio K., joined the group as a vocalist shortly thereafter, as did guitarists Albert Lee and Nick van Maarth, replacing Hardin. The 1973 album &quot;Remnants&quot; and the 1974 album &quot;A Long Way from Lubbock&quot; featured the sextet of Allison, Curtis, Krikorian, Grech, Lee and van Maarth.

In 1978, the award-winning film &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot;, starring Gary Busey as Holly, presented an engaging but inaccurate depiction of the band&#x27;s early years. Allison and Mauldin&#x27;s names were altered to Jesse Charles and Ray Bob Simmons, respectively, to avoid legal action due to their rights being sold to another film production that was also working on Holly&#x27;s story. Niki Sullivan, Sonny Curtis, Bob Montgomery, Don Guess, and Larry Welborn were written out of the film. The Crickets gave a thumbs down review of the film wherein Allison expressed his dislike on the portrayal of his fictional counterpart Jesse Charles: vulgar, racist, alcoholic, and profane.

In the 1980s, Waylon Jennings called to ask the Crickets (JI, Joe B and Sonny) to open for him on a tour. They stayed with him for five years. Gordon Payne (Waylon&#x27;s guitarist) played lead and on a few gigs when Sonny broke his arm. Gordon joined the Crickets as lead guitarist and singer when Sonny left. This trio of JI, Joe B and Gordon toured for some years including visits to the UK, and releasing an LP called “Three Piece” on Roller Coaster Records with additional input from Jim Horn (sax), Wayne Jackson (trumpet) and Dennis Burnside (keyboards). In the UK Paul McCartney recorded the Crickets single &quot;T Shirt&quot; in his studio and played piano on the track. During this time a Swedish Television Company recorded a film showing JI, Joe B and Gordon touring the UK and Sweden, as well as at home in Tennessee. It was called &quot;My Love Is Bigger than a Cadillac&quot;. In 1994, Gordon Payne left and Sonny returned and was joined by Glen D Hardin to take the group to a four piece band. After recording &quot;Well All Right&quot; with Nanci Griffith, the group toured the UK with Griffith and her Orchestra.

====21st century====

The Crickets released &quot;The Crickets and Their Buddies&quot; in 2004, featuring classics from all parts of their career, with performances by several prominent artists, including Eric Clapton, Rodney Crowell, Waylon Jennings, Nanci Griffith, John Prine, Graham Nash, and Bobby Vee. The album was produced and mixed by Greg Ladanyi and included editing and additional mixes by Dave Carlock, Rob Hill, and Rogers Masson. For the album, the Crickets officially consisted of Allison, Curtis and Mauldin; former members Albert Lee (guitar) and Glen D. Hardin (keyboards) also played throughout, and one-time member Steven Krikorian (now known as Tonio K.) was the lead vocalist on two tracks.

On October 28, 2008, the Crickets were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee. They performed &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;, &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; at the ceremony, accompanied by guest guitarist Keith Richards. In 2011, Allison was still touring with Sonny Curtis, a childhood friend and bandmate of Holly&#x27;s, on vocals and guitar.

On April 14, 2012, the Crickets were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by a special committee charged with correcting the omission of the band with Holly when he was first inducted in 1986. The inducted members were Jerry Allison, Sonny Curtis, Joe B. Mauldin, and Niki Sullivan. The group was unable to attend the ceremony because Mauldin was ill. Mauldin died from cancer on February 7, 2015, in Nashville, Tennessee.

On February 6, 2016, &quot;The Crickets &amp; Buddies&quot; performed in Clear Lake, Iowa, at the Surf Ballroom, the site of Holly&#x27;s last performance. Members of previous line-ups appeared, including Sonny Curtis, Glen D. Hardin, Albert Lee, Tommy Allsup, Gordon Payne and others. After the show, Allison announced that it was the group&#x27;s final performance.

Allison died of cancer on August 22, 2022.

<text>Bryan Ferry (born 26 September 1945) is an English singer and songwriter who was the frontman of the band Roxy Music and also a solo artist. His voice has been described as an &quot;elegant, seductive croon&quot;. He also established a distinctive image and sartorial style: according to &quot;The Independent&quot;, Ferry and his contemporary David Bowie influenced a generation with both their music and their appearances. Peter York described Ferry as &quot;an art object&quot; who &quot;should hang in the Tate&quot;.

Born to a working-class family, Ferry studied fine art and taught at a secondary school before pursuing a career in music. In 1970 he began to assemble Roxy Music with a group of friends and acquaintances in London, and took the role of lead singer and main songwriter. The band achieved immediate international success with the release of their self-titled debut album in 1972, containing a rich multitude of sounds, which reflected Ferry&#x27;s interest in exploring different genres of music. Their second album, &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot; (1973), further cultivated the band&#x27;s unique sound and visual image that would establish Ferry as a leading cultural icon over the next decade.

Ferry began a parallel solo career in 1973 by releasing &quot;These Foolish Things&quot;, which popularized the concept of a contemporary musician releasing an album covering standard songs and was a drastic departure from his ongoing work with Roxy Music. His second album, &quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot; (1974), featured on its cover the image Ferry posing by a pool in a white dinner jacket, a persona which Rolling Stone magazine dubbed &quot;dandy of the bizarre&quot;. Over the next two years, Roxy Music released a trilogy of albums, &quot;Stranded&quot; (1973), &quot;Country Life&quot; (1974) and &quot;Siren&quot; (1975), which broadened the band&#x27;s appeal internationally and saw Ferry take greater interest in the role of a live performer, reinventing himself in stage costumes ranging from gaucho to military uniforms. In 1983, following the release of their best-selling album &quot;Avalon&quot; the previous year, Ferry disbanded Roxy Music to concentrate on his solo career, with his next album, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Boys and Girls&quot;, reaching No. 1 in the UK and featuring the hit singles &quot;Slave to Love&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Dance&quot;, while the next two albums &quot;Bête Noire&quot; (1987) and &quot;Taxi&quot; (1993) both went Top 10 in the UK.

As well as being a prolific songwriter, Ferry has recorded many cover versions, including standards from the Great American Songbook, in albums such as &quot;These Foolish Things&quot; (1973), &quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot; (1974), &quot;Let&#x27;s Stick Together&quot; (1976), &quot;Taxi&quot; (1993) and &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; (1999), as well as &quot;Dylanesque&quot; (2007), an album of Bob Dylan covers. Including his work with Roxy Music, Ferry has sold over 30 million albums worldwide. In 2019, Ferry was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music.

==Early life==
Ferry was born in Washington, County Durham, son of Mary Ann and Frederick Charles Ferry. His parents were working-class: his father was a farm labourer who also looked after pit ponies. He attended Washington Grammar-Technical School (now called Washington Academy) on Spout Lane from 1957.

As a child he had a job as a paperboy and bought jazz magazines with his earnings. He studied fine art at Newcastle University from 1964 until 1968, under Richard Hamilton for one year, and some of his paintings were displayed at the Tate Gallery in 1970. His contemporaries included Tim Head and Nick de Ville. During this period, Ferry was a member of the bands the Banshees, City Blues, and the Gas Board, the latter of which featured his university classmates Graham Simpson and John Porter. He then moved to London in 1968 and taught art and pottery at Holland Park School while pursuing a career in music.

==Career==
===Roxy Music (1970–1983)===

Ferry formed Roxy Music with a group of friends and acquaintances, beginning with bassist Graham Simpson, an art school classmate, in November 1970. The line-up was expanded to include saxophonist/oboist Andy Mackay and Brian Eno, an acquaintance who owned tape recorders and played Mackay&#x27;s synthesiser. Other early members included timpanist Dexter Lloyd and ex-Nice guitarist David O&#x27;List, though by the time the band recorded their first album, the line-up had settled as Ferry, Simpson, Mackay, Eno, drummer Paul Thompson and guitarist Phil Manzanera. Around late 1970/early 1971, Ferry auditioned for King Crimson, who were seeking a new singer and bassist to replace Gordon Haskell. Although his voice was deemed not right for Crimson, band members Robert Fripp and Peter Sinfield were still impressed with Ferry and quickly developed a friendship with him that would lead to Roxy Music being signed to Crimson&#x27;s management company E.G. and Sinfield producing their first album and its subsequent non-album single &quot;Virginia Plain&quot;.

Released on 16 June 1972, Roxy Music&#x27;s self-titled debut album reached no. 10 on the UK album charts and immediately established the band&#x27;s presence in the British music scene. By the time the album was released Simpson had departed and the band would undergo several changes of bassist for the next few years. Later that summer the band made its television debut on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, performing their first hit single, &quot;Virginia Plain&quot;, marking one of the first electronic music performances on a mainstream television show. The first two Roxy Music albums were written solely by Ferry; the debut contained a pastiche of musical styles, representing Ferry&#x27;s wide-ranging interests, while the second album, &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot; (1973), pursued a darker, more determined mood.

Ferry met women&#x27;s fashion designer Antony Price at a party in Holland Park in 1972, and later that year enlisted him alongside other friends including Nick de Ville to create the cover for Roxy Music&#x27;s debut album. Featuring model Kari-Ann Moller splayed on the floor in a dress designed by Price, the cover image captivated the attention of the general public and according to writer Richard Williams was, &quot;nothing less than a challenge, bold and direct, to the prevailing complacency.&quot; Ferry would continue art-directing each Roxy Music album cover to follow.

Ferry began a parallel solo career in 1973, performing cover versions of old standards on his debut studio album &quot;These Foolish Things&quot; (1973) and his second album &quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot; (1974), both of which reached the UK top 5. Ferry&#x27;s interest in the Great American Songbook represented a stark departure from Roxy Music, and the success of these two albums created a template which would be followed later by other artists including Joni Mitchell, Rod Stewart and Bob Dylan. Embarking on his first solo tour in support of these albums, in 1973 Ferry was notably denied his request for a show at the Royal Albert Hall due to a ban on rock concerts before ultimately being granted his first performance a year later, in December 1974. Ferry&#x27;s debut at the Royal Albert Hall was recorded and later released as &quot;Live at the Royal Albert Hall, 1974&quot; in 2020. Contemporary reviews of this period of Ferry&#x27;s live performances noted his &quot;actor&#x27;s instinct for understatement&quot; and praised his novelty and command on stage, concluding &quot;to be Bryan Ferry in 1974 was like being Bob Dylan in 1965, Clark Gable in 1939, and Oscar Wilde in 1895.&quot;

Between 1972 and 1974, Ferry&#x27;s creative output was prolific, as he released a total of six studio albums between his solo career and Roxy Music. The third Roxy Music album, &quot;Stranded&quot; (1973), saw the departure of Brian Eno and the recruitment by Ferry of violinist and keyboardist Eddie Jobson, a contributor to Ferry&#x27;s first solo album. &quot;Stranded&quot; became Roxy Music&#x27;s first UK no. 1 album, dominating the charts for four months, and its supporting world tour saw Ferry wear a white dinner jacket and move out from behind the keyboard to take centre stage. The Rake notes, &quot;the suit became the lynchpin of his onstage persona, buoyed by iconic, ostentatious tailoring by the likes of Anthony Price.&quot; After the concert tour in support of their fifth studio album, &quot;Siren&quot; (1975), Roxy Music temporarily disbanded in 1976, though some Roxy members - Paul Thompson, Phil Manzanera, Eddie Jobson and bassists John Gustafson, John Wetton and Rick Wills - took part in the recording of Ferry&#x27;s subsequent solo material. He released three solo albums during this period, &quot;Let&#x27;s Stick Together&quot; (1976), &quot;In Your Mind&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare&quot; (1978), all of which charted in the UK top 20.

Disappointed by the lukewarm response to &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare&quot;, Ferry reformed Roxy Music at the end of 1978 to record tracks for what would become their sixth studio album, &quot;Manifesto&quot;, which was released in early 1979 and reached no. 7 in the UK album charts. By now, Roxy Music was a core quartet of Ferry, Mackay, Thompson and Manzanera, and then a core trio following Thompson&#x27;s departure at the end of 1979, augmented by a wide array of other musicians in the studio and on stage, some drawn from Ferry&#x27;s solo output. 1980&#x27;s &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot; album reached no. 1 in the UK album charts, two years before the group&#x27;s final studio release &quot;Avalon&quot; in 1982, which also reached no. 1 in the UK album charts. In-between these two albums, the band also achieved their first and only UK no. 1 single, &quot;Jealous Guy&quot;, released in 1981 as a posthumous tribute to its author, John Lennon, who had been murdered two months earlier. It was the only one of their singles not to be written or co-written by Ferry. After lengthy tours to promote the &quot;Avalon&quot; album, Ferry disbanded Roxy Music in 1983 and continued as a solo artist.

===Solo years (1984–2001)===
Resuming his solo career, Ferry&#x27;s sixth solo album, &quot;Boys and Girls&quot;, reached no. 1 in the UK in June 1985, and was his first and only solo studio album to top the chart. &quot;Boys and Girls&quot; remained in the UK chart for 44 weeks and its lead single, &quot;Slave to Love&quot;, reached the UK top ten. In July 1985, Ferry performed at the London Live Aid show, accompanied by Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour.

After the &quot;Avalon&quot; promotional tours, Ferry was reluctant to return to touring; a change of management persuaded him to resume touring in 1988 to promote the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Bête Noire&quot;. Following the tour, Ferry teamed again with Brian Eno for &quot;Mamouna&quot; (collaborating with Robin Trower on guitar and as producer). The album took more than five years to produce, and was created under the working title &quot;Horoscope&quot;. During production, Ferry simultaneously recorded and released a covers album, &quot;Taxi&quot;, in 1993, his eighth solo studio album, which peaked at no. 2 on the UK charts. &quot;Mamouna&quot; (Ferry&#x27;s ninth solo studio album) was released in 1994, peaking at no. 11 on the UK charts. In 1996, Ferry performed the song &quot;Dance with Life&quot; for the &quot;Phenomenon&quot; soundtrack, written by Bernie Taupin and Martin Page.

In 1999, Ferry released his tenth solo studio album, &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, consisting of cover versions of 1930s songs. The album peaked at no. 16 in the UK charts and was nominated for a Grammy Award.

===Roxy Music reunion (2001–2011)===
Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson re-reformed Roxy Music in 2001 and toured extensively for a couple of years, though the band did not record any new material. In 2002, Ferry released a new studio album, &quot;Frantic&quot;, which featured several tracks written with David A. Stewart of Eurythmics as well as collaborations with Eno, Manzanera and Thompson. The album was a mix of new original material and covers – something that Ferry had not attempted on a solo album since &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare&quot; in 1978.

In 2005, it was confirmed that Roxy Music (Ferry, Mackay, Manzanera and Thompson) would perform shows at that year&#x27;s Isle of Wight Festival and that they would record an album of new and original songs, with no indication of when such a project would reach completion. Brian Eno confirmed that he had worked in the studio with Roxy Music once more and had co-written songs for the new album. However, Ferry later stated that some of the material from these sessions would most likely be released as part of his next solo album. In October 2006, he signed a contract with the British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer to model its &quot;Autograph&quot; men&#x27;s clothing range.

In March 2007, Ferry released the album &quot;Dylanesque&quot;, an album of Bob Dylan songs. The album charted in the UK top 10, and Ferry undertook a UK tour. On 7 October 2008, Ferry was honoured as a BMI Icon at the annual BMI London Awards.
Ferry&#x27;s new studio album &quot;Olympia&quot; was, released in October 2010. The album included some of the material he recorded with his former Roxy Music band members, and featured musicians such as Nile Rodgers, David A. Stewart, Scissor Sisters, Groove Armada, Flea, Jonny Greenwood and David Gilmour. The model Kate Moss was featured on the album cover.

Ferry also co-wrote the song &quot;Shameless&quot; on Groove Armada&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Black Light&quot;. The album received a nomination for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards in the category Best Dance/Electronic Album.

In 2011, Roxy Music performed together for the last time before going on indefinite hiatus as Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay, and Thompson embarked on a world tour to celebrate the group&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

===Return to solo work (2011–2020)===
In June 2011, Ferry was made a CBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for his contribution to the British music industry, and in 2012 he was awarded the French national honour of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. In 2014, Ferry was made an honorary Doctor of Music by Newcastle University.

On 26 November 2012, he released a new album entitled &quot;The Jazz Age&quot; with the Bryan Ferry Orchestra. The album features 1920s period jazz renditions of some of Ferry&#x27;s songs (from both his solo discography and with Roxy Music). Film director Baz Luhrmann asked to use Ferry&#x27;s song &quot;Love Is the Drug&quot; from &quot;The Jazz Age&quot; album for the 2013 film &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. This resulted in a collaboration with the Bryan Ferry Orchestra to create several jazz pieces throughout the movie, released as a separate album titled &quot;The Great Gatsby – The Jazz Recordings (A Selection of Yellow Cocktail Music)&quot;. Ferry began touring with the Bryan Ferry Orchestra in 2013, including a performance at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival which was opened by Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Great Gatsby&quot; film.

In 2014, Ferry toured extensively, with notable performances including Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, as well as an appearance at the Chicago Theatre, which was preceded by a talk with author Michael Bracewell at the Museum of Contemporary Art on the subjects of fame and his creative inspiration. Also in 2014, Ferry collaborated with the Norwegian DJ/producer Todd Terje, providing vocals on a cover version of &quot;Johnny and Mary&quot; (originally recorded by Robert Palmer). The track was released as a single and appeared on Terje&#x27;s album &quot;It&#x27;s Album Time&quot;. In June 2014, Ferry appeared at the Glastonbury Festival, and in 2015 he returned to Coachella to perform as a guest artist with Terje.

In November 2014, Ferry released a new album entitled &quot;Avonmore&quot;, featuring original material and two cover songs (including the aforementioned &quot;Johnny and Mary&quot; with Terje). To support the album, Ferry launched a 20-date tour across the UK and released his first-ever solo live album, &quot;Live 2015&quot;. Ferry continued to tour Europe and North America in the three years following the album&#x27;s release, consistently playing no fewer than 30 shows each year. In 2017, Ferry gave his debut performance at the Hollywood Bowl, backed by the venue&#x27;s full orchestra. Music industry critic Bob Lefsetz reviewed the performance, and noted Ferry&#x27;s orchestral performance of &quot;The Main Thing&quot; as a highlight. In November and December 2018, Ferry made his second appearance with the long-running concert series Night of the Proms in Germany, along with the Pointer Sisters, Milow, and Tim Bendzko.

While furthering his solo career in recent years, Ferry has continued to collaborate with previous members of Roxy Music, including backing singer Fonzi Thornton and guitarist Neil Hubbard. Both Thornton and Hubbard toured with Ferry extensively during his promotion of the &quot;Avonmore&quot; album in 2015 and 2016. In February 2018, a 45th anniversary deluxe edition of Roxy Music&#x27;s eponymous debut album was released, including numerous demos, outtakes, and unseen photographs curated over the years by Ferry. During his promotional tour to support the deluxe re-issue, Ferry said he was open to collaborating once again with Roxy Music keyboardist Brian Eno.

Bryan Ferry and His Orchestra announced the new album &quot;Bitter-Sweet&quot; in November 2018. The Bryan Ferry World Tour 2019 set off across four continents in February, playing one British date at the 5,200-seater Royal Albert Hall in June, also adding 18 dates in North America through August and September. A separate date was slated for the BST Hyde Park festival in July 2019.

In February 2020 Ferry released live album &quot;Live At The Royal Albert Hall, 1974&quot;, a recording from his first ever solo tour.

Ferry continued touring with a UK run in March 2020, finishing the tour shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down touring in the United Kingdom.

===Post-pandemic work and Roxy Music reunion (2021–present)===
In April 2021, Ferry released &quot;Royal Albert Hall 2020&quot;, an album recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall in March 2020, prior to the lockdown as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The proceeds of the album went to support Ferry&#x27;s touring band and crew members. A 2021 tour that had been planned, was ultimately cancelled due to on-going restrictions. In June of the same year, Ferry&#x27;s first six albums were remastered and re-released on vinyl.

In March 2022, Ferry announced, alongside bandmates Andy Mackay, Phil Manzanera and Paul Thompson, that Roxy Music would be touring for the first time since 2011. The tour was billed as a celebration of Roxy Music&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The tour took place in September and October 2022, across Canada, United States and United Kingdom. In May 2022, Ferry released a cover EP called &quot;Love Letters&quot;, and a new book titled &quot;Lyrics&quot; that looked back on his song writing through the Roxy Music and solo years

Continuing the re-release of his solo vinyl records, in late 2023 Ferry released &quot;Mamouna&quot; and confirmed an additional unreleased partner album &quot;Horoscope&quot;, would join the deluxe release. Ahead of Record Store Day 2024, Ferry re-released &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; as an EP on a limited edition blue vinyl. In March of the same year, Ferry entered a partnership with Irving Azoff&#x27;s Iconic Artists Group, which involved the sale of 50% of his catalogue to the company.

On July 31, 2024, Ferry announced the upcoming release on October 25, 2024, of &quot;Retrospective: Selected Recordings&quot;, a massive 81-track five-CD career-spanning collection capturing 50 years of his music from 1973 to 2023, his first ever comprehensive career retrospective. The same day, Ferry released through YouTube a reimagined cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;She Belongs to Me&quot;. Per a press release, the upcoming project is billed as a The compilation should also pay tribute to Ferry&#x27;s songwriting legacy and includes his top singles such as his 1985&#x27;s hit &quot;Slave to Love&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Style and influence===
Ferry&#x27;s vocal style is regarded as unique and highly influential. When asked for examples of singers she studied, Kate Bush remarked &quot;I thought [Ferry] was the most exciting singer that I&#x27;d heard ... For me it covered the whole emotional spectrum, and I just couldn&#x27;t get enough of it.&quot; In reviewing a 1975 Roxy Music concert, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described Ferry&#x27;s voice as &quot;a second tenor which lacks vocal antecedent&quot;, going further to note, &quot;his voice operates on the same principle as hotel room service. Studied effects appear with hazy origins, use themselves up, and are removed without explanation.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Ferry at number 150 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Inducting Roxy Music into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019, Duran Duran lead singer Simon Le Bon described Ferry&#x27;s lyric writing as &quot;open-heart surgery&quot;.

In addition to his contributions to music, Ferry has also come to be known for his distinctive style and artistic sensibilities as well as a &quot;synonym for cool&quot;. In 2005, &quot;GQ&quot; presented Ferry with its Lifetime Achievement Award, deeming him &quot;pop&#x27;s original art-school bobby-dazzler&quot; and noting his solo career spent as the &quot;world&#x27;s best-dressed and most languidly mannered deluxe chanteur&quot;. &quot;Esquire&quot; has noted Ferry&#x27;s lifelong obsession with clothing and describing any in-person interaction with him as a &quot;bespoke event, a louche ensemble of elegant affectations&quot;. In 2007, Belgian fashion designer Dries van Noten created a Fall 2007 collection inspired by outfits Ferry wore during his solo career and tenure with Roxy Music.

In his 1976 essay &quot;Them&quot;, cultural critic Peter York described Ferry as &quot;the best possible example of the ultimate art-directed existence&quot; and suggested he was the most important pasticheur in Britain at the time. Ferry has credited numerous art and film influences throughout his career, among them Richard Hamilton, Marcel Duchamp, and Humphrey Bogart. Hamilton is credited by Ferry as an inspiration to him both as an artist and as a person, and is also responsible for introducing Ferry as an art student to Duchamp&#x27;s work. The title of Ferry&#x27;s 1978 solo album &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare&quot; is taken from Duchamp&#x27;s classic work &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even&quot;. For Bogart, Ferry penned the song &quot;2HB&quot; (&quot;2HB&quot; = &quot;To Humphrey Bogart&quot;), leading the band Madness to record &quot;4BF&quot; (&quot;for Bryan Ferry&quot;), on their 1988 album &quot;The Madness&quot;. Phil Manzanera – who would become Roxy Music&#x27;s guitarist – recalls, during his audition to join the band, that Ferry and he discussed Humphrey Bogart and classic films from the Golden Age of Hollywood.

===Relationships and family===
In 1975, Ferry began a relationship with model Jerry Hall. They first met when she appeared on the album cover for &quot;Siren&quot; (1975), which was photographed in Wales during the summer of 1975. According to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, the photo shoot boosted Hall&#x27;s status as an international celebrity. Her stay at Ferry&#x27;s Holland Park (London) home, following the album photo shoot, marked the start of their relationship. Hall and Ferry lived together, sharing homes in London and in the Bel Air neighbourhood of Los Angeles, and Hall also appeared in some of Ferry&#x27;s solo music videos, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Stick Together&quot; and &quot;The Price of Love&quot; (both 1976). Their relationship ended when she left him for Mick Jagger in late 1977.

Ferry rarely talks about Hall, but fans have often speculated his song &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; from his album &quot;Bête Noire&quot; (1987) was his response to Hall&#x27;s 1985 tell-all book in which she discussed their relationship. Additionally, Ferry&#x27;s 1978 solo album &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare&quot; is widely believed to contain allusions to his break-up with Hall, particularly the song &quot;When She Walks in the Room&quot;.

On 26 June 1982, Ferry married London socialite Lucy Helmore, who had become pregnant with their child Otis (b. 1 November 1982). Though her face is not seen, Helmore was the model on the front cover of Roxy Music&#x27;s album &quot;Avalon&quot; (1982), released a month before their wedding. The couple had three more sons, Isaac, Tara, and Merlin. After 21 years of marriage the couple divorced in 2003. Helmore died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 2018, while on holiday in County Clare, Ireland, after what her brother described as &quot;a long battle with depression&quot;. Ferry said he was &quot;saddened and shocked&quot; by her death.

In 2000, the whole Ferry family were on British Airways Flight 2069 to Nairobi when a passenger forced his way into the cockpit, attacked the pilot and caused the plane to lurch downwards. The assailant eventually was overcome, and the pilot recovered from a descent of 12,000 feet in 25 seconds; the fastest rate of descent from which any civil aircraft has ever recovered.

By 2008, Ferry&#x27;s son Tara was performing in a rock band called Rubber Kiss Goodbye. By 2008, Merlin was studying for &quot;A&quot; Levels at Marlborough College, and then played guitar in a band called Voltorb. Ferry&#x27;s children have also contributed to his albums &quot;Olympia&quot; and &quot;Avonmore&quot;. On &quot;Olympia&quot;, Tara played drums on several tracks, Merlin played guitar on one track, and Isaac was the producer of the album&#x27;s artwork. Tara also toured with Ferry (and Roxy Music) on the band&#x27;s 2011 For Your Pleasure tour, performing additional drums.

Ferry&#x27;s youngest son, Merlin, was seriously injured in a head-on car crash in Shropshire in December 2014.

Ferry and Helmore split in the early 2000s after she had an affair, and they divorced in 2003. After their separation, British newspapers photographed Ferry with Katie Turner, 35 years his junior, naming her as his new girlfriend. Ferry and Turner met while she worked as one of the dancers on Roxy Music&#x27;s concert tour in 2001 (and is featured on the DVD of the 2001 Hammersmith Odeon show). She appeared with Ferry on several TV shows to promote the &quot;Frantic&quot; album, and performed on the &quot;Frantic&quot; tour in 2002. After their break-up, in 2006, he resumed his relationship with Katie Turner for some time.

In 2009, Ferry began a relationship with Amanda Sheppard, and on 4 January 2012, they married in a private ceremony on the Turks and Caicos Islands. In August 2013, it was reported that the couple were to separate after 19 months of marriage, and they divorced in 2014.

Ferry was estimated to have a fortune of £30 million in the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; of 2010.

===Political views===
In 1988, Ferry referred to himself as &quot;sort of conservative&quot; in his beliefs in an interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. He also expressed support for having a strong work ethic, stating &quot;most of my life is spent working hard. I come from the kind of working-class background where you have to work very hard and if you don&#x27;t, you feel guilty.&quot;

In 2007, controversy arose when Ferry praised the imagery and iconography of Nazi Germany in an interview with the German newspaper &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;, citing in particular &quot;Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s movies and Albert Speer&#x27;s buildings&quot;. In the same interview Ferry was reported to have referred to his West London recording studio as &quot;The Führerbunker&quot; (Adolf Hitler&#x27;s bunker during World War II). Ferry later issued a public apology for any offence caused by the comments. Jewish Labour peer Greville Janner criticised Ferry for his remarks. At the time of the controversy, Ferry was contracted to the British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer, one of whose co-founders Michael Marks was Jewish, to model its &quot;Autograph&quot; menswear line. Despite Ferry&#x27;s public apology for his comments, Marks &amp; Spencer opted to sever its ties with him.

In 2007, Ferry performed at a concert to raise funds for the Countryside Alliance.

In 2008, Ferry indicated that he supported the Conservative Party, referring to himself as &quot;conservative by nature&quot; but essentially apolitical, preferring not to mix art with politics. Without elaborating, he stated he was &quot;proud&quot; of his son Otis and described the then Labour Government&#x27;s ban on fox hunting as &quot;futile&quot;. He also expressed an opposition to &quot;left-wing bitterness&quot; and political correctness, arguing both were stifling to individual liberty and freedom of expression. The model of free speech he cited was the 1970s. In a 2009 interview, Ferry stated: I would support a Cameron government. I have met him, and he&#x27;s a bright guy. I hope they do well. I don&#x27;t like the way the present Government has done things, most of all putting my son in prison for four and a half months, totally unlawfully ... and that&#x27;s not just my opinion: judges, all sorts, have said it was a stitch-up. It was politically motivated. The poor lad just wants to live the traditional country life.

In 2012, Ferry was a guest at the Conservative Party&#x27;s black-and-white ball. In 2020, he described incumbent Prime Minister Boris Johnson as &quot;bright&quot; but expressed a reluctance to discuss politics.

In August 2014, Ferry was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In 1985, Ferry contributed the song &quot;Is Your Love Strong Enough?&quot; to the Ridley Scott film &quot;Legend&quot;. The song, featuring guitar work by David Gilmour, plays during the end credits of the US theatrical release, and was released with the Tangerine Dream version of the soundtrack on CD (although this is out of print and rare). A promotional music video was created, integrating Ferry and Gilmour into scenes from the film; this is included as a bonus in Ferry&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; DVD release. The song was later covered by How to Destroy Angels for the soundtrack to the 2011 US version of &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;. A heavily fictionalised version of Ferry featured in the last episode of the first series of &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot;. In it, he lived in the forest and raised the character Vince Noir alongside multiple animals.

== Filmography ==
===Acting===
Ferry had a cameo role in the fourth episode of the French television miniseries &quot;Petit déjeuner compris,&quot; which first aired in 1980. In 2004, he starred in the short film &quot;The Porter,&quot; and in 2005 he appeared in Neil Jordan&#x27;s film &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; as the character Mr. Silky String.

In 2017 Ferry appeared as a cabaret singer in the television series &quot;Babylon Berlin&quot;. In addition, he contributed six songs to the series and its soundtrack, including &quot;Dance Away&quot; from the 1979 album &quot;Manifesto&quot;, and &quot;Bitter-Sweet&quot;, with its original German verses, from the 1974 album &quot;Country Life&quot;.
