<text>Warrumbungle National Park is a heritage listed national park located in the Orana region of New South Wales, Australia. The national park is located approximately northwest of Sydney and contained within . The park attracts approximately visitors per annum.

The national park is based on the geographical Warrumbungle Mountain Range, sometimes shortened to the Warrumbungles, and thus the park name is often heard in the plural. The park lies within the Pilliga Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance for a range of woodland bird species, many of which are threatened.

Warrumbungle National Park was added to the Australian National Heritage List in December 2006.

On 4 July 2016, the park was the first within Australia to be certified as a Dark Sky Park by the International Dark Sky Association.

==Access==
The nearest towns to the park are Baradine, Coonabarabran, Coonamble, Gilgandra, Gulargambone, and Tooraweenah. Access via Coonabarabran to the east is by of sealed road called the John Renshaw Parkway, built in 1966. Via Coonamble to the west, access is by a long road with some gravel.

The park is contained within three local government areas: Warrumbungle Shire to the east, Gilgandra Shire to the south and Coonamble Shire to the west.

==Features==

Located within the large area of temperate savanna grasslands the park incorporates the most spectacular part of the Warrumbungle mountains, a region of past volcanic activity with unusual lava formations. Some of the most well-known rock formations include Belougery Spire, Bluff Mountain, Mount Exmouth (tallest mountain in the park), The Breadknife, Split Rock, Fans Horizon and Crater Bluff.

There are many scenic bushwalks and both rock climbing and abseiling are popular. Though the park preserved habitat for koalas in the past, a massive 2013 fire decimated the koala population; none are thought to have survived.

Located immediately adjacent to the national park is the Siding Spring Observatory. The observatory, officially opened in 1965, was constructed on the boundary of the park partly because the park provided a light-free environment. This scientific facility consists of several internationally important telescopes and has considerable socio-economic importance to the local Coonabarabran community.

==Facilities==
There are four main campsites. All camping in the park is only permitted after obtaining a permit. There is a visitors centre for bookings and keys to a number of huts. The park also caters for large school groups. There are free electric barbecues available however firewood is not supplied or to be collected within park grounds.

==History==
A proposal to reserve the more scenic parts of the Warrumbungle Range as the &quot;Warrumbungle National Monument&quot; was first initiated by the National Parks and Primitive Areas Council in 1936. The area was first proclaimed as a reserve in 1953. In 1967 management of the park was signed over to the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service. The construction of a network of walking tracks done by hand was headed by the parks first ranger, Carl Dow. The park was added to the list of the National Heritage in December 2006, in recognition of the park&#x27;s importance as an extensive and spectacular geomorphological site with bold volcanic landforms that are unrivalled anywhere else in Australia; for its unique values as a transition zone between the arid western and wetter coastal zones; and its significance as an important refugium in inland south-east Australia.

==2013 bushfire==

In January 2013 about 80% of the national park was destroyed in a conflagration (thought to have been started by lightning) that burned much of the area surrounding the park as well as destroying dozens of homes. The visitor centre and museum were wiped out, as well as railings and viewing platforms throughout the park. The park was closed after the fire, but has since reopened, although some parts remain closed.

==In popular culture==
The national park was used as a filming location for the video for singer David Bowie&#x27;s 1983 single &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, centring on The Breadknife.

The Japanese anime &quot;Adventures of the Little Koala&quot; takes place within the shadow of The Breadknife.

<text>Weddin Mountains is a national park located in New South Wales, Australia, west of Sydney. It is a small, crescent-shaped range, with a high point some , running roughly north south with steep cliffs on the eastern side sloping more gradually down to the plain in the west. Weddin mountains is a small patch of remnant vegetation which escaped clearing due to its ruggedness. Many aircraft pass overhead on their way from Sydney to Adelaide, is part of the Lachlan Fold system and is Wiradjuri country.

==History==

===Bushrangers===
Ben Hall, who plundered the Forbes-Grenfell area in the 1850s used the Weddin Mountains as a refuge. He holed up in a cave on the north-west side of the park with his gang, which included Johnnie Gilbert and Frank Gardiner. It is rumoured Ben Hall buried a treasure here that has not yet been located.

===Seaton&#x27;s Farm===
There is a walk around &#x27;Seaton&#x27;s Historic Farm&#x27;, which is now part of the national park. Seatons Farm is how one man and his wife turned every bit of wire into something useful. Jim Seaton hand made 3 km/1.8 miles of kangaroo proof fence by hand, with posts of local saplings, which are rot and vermin proof. The property was occupied in the late 1920s and during the Depression it was set up as a farm. Times and the land were hard and the buildings represent this. The sheds have walls made from flattened corrugated iron so that it stretched further. One of the sheds is full of old wire, iron sheets, bottles, everything you can imagine. All the old machinery is still there, sitting where it was when the family sold the property to the Government in the 1980s. A unique place, showing how the less well off farmers did it in the early and mid 1900s.

==Wildlife==
There are 216 species of animals recorded in Weddin Mountains National Park, the vast majority of which are birds. The species list includes three types of wallaby, one of which is the endangered brush tailed rock wallaby. The species list also includes painted honeyeater, swift parrot, little lorikeet and turquoise parrot. Pest species seen in the park are cats, rabbits, foxes, goats and sheep.

The park is part of the South-west Slopes of NSW Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for the conservation of swift parrots and superb parrots.

==Access and facilities==
Weddin Mountains National Park is most often approached from Grenfell. Travelling west from Grenfell on the Mid Western Highway there are sign posts to Holy Camp and Ben Halls Cave. The Google Earth route from Grenfell guides drivers along Euladrie road which ends at a farm two kilometres from the park with farmland in between.

===Ben Halls Cave===
Near Seaton&#x27;s Farm is Ben Halls camping and picnic area with well designed fireplace/barbecues, large enough to permit the use of camp ovens, your own barbecue or for an open fire as well as having its own BBQ plate. It is a short walk from here to Ben Halls Cave.

===Holy Camp===
 Holy Camp is south-west of Grenfell, Coordinates . The last are dirt road. It is one of the entrances to the park with a pit toilet, parking area, picnic tables and fireplaces. Camping is allowed. There is a small water tank filled from the toilet roof but don&#x27;t rely on it. From here it is possible to walk to Eualdrie and Peregrine lookouts. There is much wildlife in and around the carpark including lace monitors and skinks by day and brushtail possums and owlet nightjars by night.

===Walks===


The Eualdrie walking trail leads from Holy Camp and is advertised as a 2.5 hour return trip passing through Peregrine Lookout which takes 1.5 hours return. This was tested as 30 minutes to Perrigrine lookout, 23 minutes more to the Cairn at the summit and 40 minutes return. Peregrine Lookout is south of the carpark and from there the path turns back on itself as it proceeds upwards so that the cairn at the summit is a little north of the carpark. The path appears to continue past the cairn at Euradrie Trig (height 750 m) and can be followed down to Ben Halls Cave.

==Literature==
This small range is mentioned in a surprising number of publications. Two of note are A West Country Ballad which refers to a bounty hunter who unsuccessfully tried to capture Gardiner in the Weddin mountains and Robbery Under Arms where Weddin mountains gets a mention as a hideout.

<doc id="101124" wikidata="Q1584958" url="?curid=101124" title="Werrikimbe National Park">
<text>The Werrikimbe National Park is a protected national park located in the catchment zone of the Upper Hastings River in New South Wales, Australia. Gazetted in 1975, the park is situated approximately north of Sydney, north-west of , and east of Walcha on the eastern escarpment of the Great Dividing Range.

The park is part of the Hastings-Macleay group World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

==Description==
Werrikimbe Park is noted for a rich diversity of plants and animals, rainforest, extensive wilderness, scenic wild rivers and opportunities for outdoor recreation in a remote location. This national park contains an Aboriginal stone arrangement of two stone rings, bora rings, where initiation ceremonies were held.

===Access and facilities===
All access roads to the park have a gravel surface, winding and steep in places. These roads are unsuitable for caravans. Beyond the Mooraback Road there is a four-wheel drive (4WD) trail to Youdales Hut visitor area which is only accessible by a 4WD with low range, after obtaining a key for the locked gate from either the National Parks and Wildlife Service or Apsley Motors in Walcha. There are five visitor areas with basic facilities — three on the eastern side near the edge of the escarpment, and two on the west, on the plateau.

Camping sites are available at:
* Brushy Mountain campground (20 sites) on the north-eastern edge of the park. Campsites are suitable for: car and trailer (though not caravan) next to campsite. Facilities: toilets, amenities block, picnic tables, wood barbecues
* Mooraback campground (5 sites) at the north-western end of the park. Facilities: toilets, picnic tables, wood barbecues
* Plateau Beech campground (5 sites), on the eastern side of the park. Campsites are suitable for: people who are happy to walk a short distance from car to tent. Facilities: Pit/composting toilets, amenities block, picnic tables, wood barbecues

The Bicentennial National Trail passes through the western edge of the Werrikimbe Wilderness along the headwaters of the Hastings River and onto the Kunderang Brook. Horses and vehicles are not permitted within the declared Wilderness.

==History==
The Mooraback area was one of the earliest settlements along the &quot;Falls Country&quot; to the east of Walcha, with records showing the first settlers grazed blocks at Mooraback in the 1850s. The names of some of these settlers are reflected in the names featured in the park: Bishops Swamp, Cleghorns Creek and Careys Trail.

During the 1950s some manganese mining was carried out in what is now within the park confines.

==Flora and fauna==
There is a great variety of vegetation here, depending on rainfall and altitude: eucalypt woodlands, coachwoods, southern sassafras, stinging trees, long-leaf waxflowers and yellow carabeens with their flying buttressed trunks. Werrikimbe is home to the rare plants such as &quot;Chiloglottis&quot; bird orchids, downy guinea flowers and fairy lanterns. These forests also contain the only examples of filmy king fern known to occur in northern New South Wales. The Antarctic beech forest, found at the end of the North Plateau Road, is estimated to be up to 1,000 years old and forms the largest compact southern beech forest in existence. The threatened &quot;parva&quot; subspecies of pygmy cypress pine occurs on the eastern edge of the Northern Tablelands in the park.

Werrikimbe is the habitat of at least 22 threatened animal species. The rare Hastings River mouse was considered to be extinct until rediscovered in the park in 1981; it frequents the heathlands and open forest areas near streams. The Australian brushturkey, koala, eastern whipbird, powerful owl, gliders, quolls and lyrebirds may be seen. The park has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it contains one of only five known populations of rufous scrub-birds. It also supports flame and pale-yellow robins, paradise riflebirds, green catbirds, regent bowerbirds and Australian logrunners.

<text>The Willandra National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Far West region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated approximately west of Sydney and comprises flat grassy plain bounded to the north by Willandra Creek, which is a tributary of the Lachlan River.

==Location and regional context==
The Willandra National Park was established in May 1972. It is relatively remote, being located about northwest of , and by road from . The surrounding district is used primarily for extensive grazing of sheep and cattle. Most roads in the area are unsealed and become slippery and unusable after only moderate rainfall. The climate is semi-arid, with very hot summers and cold winters. The park is situated on the northern edge of the Riverina Plain of the Murray Basin lowlands.

==History==
Aboriginal occupation of the area is thought to date back at least 15,000 years. Willandra Creek formed a rough boundary between the Wiradjuri people to the south and the Wongaibon people to the north.

Europeans first settled the area in the 1830s. Initially this settlement was low key pastoral activity and allowed the Aboriginal people to largely continue their traditional way of living. However, during the 1870s and early 1880s extensive programs of fencing, buildings and dam construction took place as the first phase of European permanent settlement occurred. In 1894 Willandra passed into the ownership of the London Bank of Melbourne, after the entrepreneurial empire of its previous owners, the Whittingham Brothers, collapsed in the 1890s depression. Under the management of Arthur and Frank Laird during the subsequent period, Willandra became a renowned sheep property, winning many prizes for the quality of its Merino flock.

In 1912 Willandra was sold to the Vickery Partnership and was struck by drought for a period of two years immediately afterward. By 1914 the size of the flock had dropped to 10,000 sheep with larger numbers of stock having been moved from the property as the dry progressed. The Company reached its peak as a stud property in the 1920s and 1930s. Shearing numbers reached 96,943 in 1931 for a total of 3,243 bales of wool and the property area expanded to . A new homestead (still standing and available for accommodation) was added in 1918, along with numerous other buildings over the years. The property boasted a tennis court, a croquet lawn and orchards and was, and remains, a remarkable oasis in a typically dry and dusty landscape.

Despite high wool prices in the 1950s, Willandra had begun its decline as a prominent pastoral property, which had been exacerbated by a prolonged drought after the Second World War. 
In 1960 the New Zealand and Australian Land Company bought Willandra and its area shrank to . However, prosperity returned for a time and the property had up to 22 staff.

In 1969 Dalgety plc purchased the property, but declined to renew the pastoral leases when they expired in 1971. With the expiration of the leases, the NSW Government resumed the Crown Land grants and gazetted Willandra National Park in 1972. Subsequently, the reserve has been managed by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service. A major restoration program in the late 1990s restored the buildings to their former glory and a number of them are available for public accommodation.

== Heritage listings ==
Willandra National Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Willandra Homestead

==Vegetation and wildlife==
The park is very flat with few elevated features. For the most part it is grassland, with trees only along the watercourses and around the normally dry lakes and depressions. The low woodland is dominated by black box (&quot;Eucalyptus largiflorens&quot;) and River Cooba (&quot;Acacia stenophylla&quot;). Before European settlement saltbush, cotton bush and native grasses are likely to have been the main plant cover on the plains. However, over 100 years of grazing and some pasture improvement have modified this and the plant and animal communities do not represent the environments that existed prior to European settlement. Despite this, Willandra is important habitat for many native species, including the emu, the threatened Plains-wanderer, red and grey kangaroos, echidnas and a variety of reptiles, such as Gould&#x27;s Sand Goanna and the Mulga Brown Snake.

<doc id="101128" wikidata="Q1811861" url="?curid=101128" title="Wollemi National Park">
<text>The Wollemi National Park () is a protected national park and wilderness area that is located in the Central West and Hunter region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The park, the second largest national park in New South Wales, contains the Wollemi Wildernessthe largest such wilderness area in Australiaand is situated approximately northwest of Sydney.

The Wollemi National Park is one of the eight protected areas that, in 2000, was inscribed to form part of the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Greater Blue Mountains Area. The Wollemi National Park is the most northwesterly of the eight protected areas within the World Heritage Site. The national park forms part of the Great Dividing Range. 

Due to the park&#x27;s ruggedness, much of it is undiscovered by humans and the many canyons have yet to be explored. The only known living wild specimens of the Wollemi pine (&quot;Wollemia nobilis&quot;) were discovered in 1994. Special efforts were made to protect the trees when the 2019-20 Australian bushfires burned through the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR 2020/01/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The national park is bounded to the north by the Goulburn River National Park and the Bylong Valley Way; to the east by the Yengo National Park, the Parr State Conservation Area, and the Putty Road; to the south by the Blue Mountains National Park and the Bells Line of Road; to the southwest by the Wolgan Valley and the Gardens of Stone National Park; and to the west by open farmland that surround the towns of and and the Capertee Valley.

==Geology==

The Wollemi National Park is located on the western edge of the Sydney Basin. It sits on four strata of sedimentary rock; the Narrabeen and Hawkesbury sandstone and shale, the Illawarra and Singleton Permian coal measures and the Wianamatta shales. The strata at this area of the Sydney Basin have an upwards tilt to the north-west. Throughout most of the park the Hawkesbury and Wianamatta series have been eroded away exposing the Narrabeen group. 

The landscape of the park is dominated by deep valleys, canyons, cliffs and waterfalls, formed by the weathering of the sandstone and claystone the Narrabeen group consists of. The parts of the park that lie on the Narrabeen and Hawkesbury sandstones generally have shallow soil with low nutrient levels while areas that lie on the Wianamatta shale usually have deeper and more nutrient rich soils allowing for a greater diversity of plant life. The coal measures are visible beneath cliff lines along river valleys. This layer is generally rich in nutrients and weathers to form deep clay loams. Tertiary basalt is common in the north west of the park. Basaltic peaks include Mount Coriaday, Mount Monundilla and Mount Coricudgy, the highest peak in the northern Blue Mountains. In some locations the basalt in the core of extinct volcanoes has eroded faster than the surrounding sandstone.

The Wollemi National Park is key in maintaining the quality of many tributary rivers to the Hawkesbury River and Goulburn-Hunter River catchments. The national park incorporates rivers such as the Wolgan River, Colo River and Capertee River which arise from outside the park. The Colo River is regarded as the last unpolluted river in New South Wales because the majority of it flows through the Wollemi National Park.

==Biology and ecology==
Eucalypt dominated open forests comprise 90% of Wollemi National Park, with over 70 species of Eucalypt recorded. The remaining 10% of the National Park comprises rainforest, heath and grassland.

The variety of habitats within Wollemi National Park allow for large diversity in animals. 58 reptile species, 38 frog species, 235 bird species and 46 mammal species have been recorded in the park.

The only known living wild specimens of the Wollemi pine (&quot;Wollemia nobilis&quot;), a species thought to have become extinct approximately thirty million years ago, were discovered in three small stands within deep canyons in 1994. The location is kept secret to protect the groves from diseases and trampling.

Besides the Wollemi Mint Bush, the park contains populations of the rare &quot;Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata&quot;, only described in 1981. The Wollemi Stringybark is a newly discovered species of Eucalyptus tree.

==Aboriginal sites==
There are many aboriginal sites within the park including cave paintings, axe grinding grooves and rock carvings. In 2003 the discovery of Eagle&#x27;s Reach cave was publicly announced. This site was found by bushwalkers in 1995 but remained unknown to the wider community until a team from the Australian Museum reached the cave in May 2003. The art within this small cave is estimated to be up to 4,000 years old and it consists of up to a dozen layers of imagery depicting a wide variety of motifs rendered in ochre and charcoal. The team who recorded this site counted over 200 separate images, mainly of animals and birds but also stencils of hands, axes and a boomerang.

It is a very significant site and the remote location is being kept secret for its own protection.

==Activities==

* Bushwalking
* Canyoning
* Canoeing
* Camping
* Abseiling
Ganguddy Campground is a campsite located on the Cudgegong River in the park. The local Wiradjuri Aboriginal people know the area as Ganguddy, the alternative name is Dunns Swamp. National Parks and Wildlife Service, New South Wales manages the location.

==Historical places==
* Wolgan Valley
* Newnes
* Newnes glow worm tunnel
* Zig Zag Railway
* Oil shale Mining
* Glen Davis

==Climate==
The Wollemi area features an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) with mild to warm summers, cool to cold winters and generally steady precipitation year-round, though with a peak in the first few months of the year.

<text>The Wyrrabalong National Park is a coastal national park that is located on the Central Coast of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park consists of two sections; the northern section consists of approximately and covers a substantial area of the peninsula between The Entrance and Norah Head as well as Terilbah and Pelican Islands within Tuggerah Lake. The southern section consists of about of the coast, from Shelly Beach south to Forresters Beach. The park is also noted for containing the last significant coastal (littoral) rainforest on the Central Coast.

Most of the park lies in the Tuggerah Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for a variety of water and woodland birds.

The average elevation of the terrain is 8 metres.

==History==
The land now occupied by Wyrrabalong National Park was first inhabited by the indigenous Darkinjung and Awabakal peoples. The Darkinjung occupied the southern section and The Awabakal occupied the northern section. It is believed Europeans first discovered the Tuggerah Lakes in 1796. It was found by Governor of Tasmania, Colonel David Collins, who had arrived on the First Fleet, during the search for an escaped convict, Mary Morgan, who was said to be living with the Aborigines to the North of the Hawkesbury River.

== Weather ==
The average summer temperature is between 20 °C and 25 °C, and the record measured temperature is 42.4 °C, in winter the temperature is between 10 °C and 17 °C, and the lowest measured temperature is 3.4 °C.

<text>The Yengo National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Lower Hunter region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The park is situated northwest of Sydney, south of , northwest of , and southwest of . The average elevation of the terrain is 309 metres.

The Yengo National Park is one of the eight protected areas that, in 2000, was inscribed to form part of the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Greater Blue Mountains Area. The Yengo National Park is the most northeasterly of the eight protected areas within the World Heritage Site. The national park forms part of the Great Dividing Range.

==Features==
The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) opened their depot in Bucketty in 1993 and commenced managing the newly established Yengo National Park. A helipad, known as &#x27;Bucketty International&#x27; was established and in 1995 a fire tower was built, following severe fires in the area. In 1999 the NPWS acquired parts of the Crown land that lay between Bucketty and the Yengo National Park. This new area also included the Convict Wall and the amphitheatre used by the community.

The Bucketty community asked NPWS to recognise their custodianship of the place and in early 2000, the community, together with the NPWS, developed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly manage the site.

Access to Yengo National Park is via Yengo Creek Road off the Great North Road, near . The park is bounded in the east by the small settlements of Bucketty and ; in the north by Wollombi Brook; in the west by the Putty Road, the settlements of and , and the Mellong Range; and in the south by the Parr State Conservation Area, the settlement of , Webbs Creek, Mogo Creek, the Hawkesbury River, and the Dharug National Park.

The course of the Macdonald River flows from the northwest of the national park towards the southeast, where it reaches its confluence with the Hawkesbury River.

== Bushfires of 2019/2020 ==
In the summer of 2019/2020, Yengo National Park was engulfed in the largest bushfire from a single ignition point that Australia has known; this fire became known as the Gospers Mountain Fire. Nearly all the national park was burnt.

== Wildlife ==
This is a place of great biodiversity. The park is home to over 50 species of mammals, such as wombats, wallaroos, koalas and gliding possums and over 200 species of birds.

<doc id="101133" wikidata="Q1122053" url="?curid=101133" title="Yuraygir National Park">
<text>Yuraygir is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, located northeast of Sydney. It was created in 1980, a result of the merger and enlargement of two national parks, Angourie and Red Rock National Parks, both of which had been established in 1975. At the time of its establishment in 1980, the park was fragmented, and parcels of land were bought over the following two decades to unite segments into a more contiguous protected area. Sometimes these acquisitions required protracted negotiations (and legal disputes) with land owners.

==Etymology==
The name is a phonetic translation of the local indigenous tribe who had lived in the area, and had formerly been transcribed variously as Jeigir, Jiegera, Jungai, Yagir, Yegera, Yegir, Yiegera or Youngai.

==Description==
Covering of coastline, it is the largest coastal park in New South Wales. The Yuraygir coastal walk traverses the coastline, and takes four days to complete. There are 48 beaches, including the highly regarded -long Shelley Beach.

Thirty species of mammal have been recorded within the park, including the threatened rufous bettong (&quot;Aepyprymnus rufescens&quot;), tiger quoll (&quot;Dasyurus maculatus&quot;), brush-tailed phascogale (&quot;Phascogale tapoatafa&quot;) and
squirrel glider (&quot;Petaurus norfolcensis&quot;). Swamps and wet heath are habitat for the threatened eastern ground parrot (&quot;Pezoporus wallicus&quot;) and eastern grass owl (&quot;Tyto longimembris&quot;).

Pests include feral pigs, cats, dogs and horses, and foxes, while problem weeds include groundsel bush (&quot;Baccharis halimifolia&quot;), bitou bush (&quot;Chrysanthemoides monilifera&quot; subsp. &quot;rotunda&quot;), lantana (&quot;Lantana camara&quot;) and
slash pine (&quot;Pinus elliottii&quot;).

<doc id="101135" wikidata="Q670146" url="?curid=101135" title="Mass of Paul VI">
<text>The Mass of Paul VI, also known as the Ordinary Form or , is the most commonly used liturgy in the Catholic Church. It was promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1969 and its liturgical books were published in 1970; those books were then revised in 1975, they were revised again by Pope John Paul II in 2000, and a third revision was published in 2002.

It largely displaced the Tridentine Mass, the latest edition of which had been published in 1962 under the title (&#x27;The Roman Missal restored by decree of the Most Holy Council of Trent&#x27;). The editions of the Mass of Paul VI Roman Missal (1970, 1975, 2002) have as title (&#x27;The Roman Missal renewed by decree of the Most Holy Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican&#x27;), followed in the case of the 2002 edition by (&#x27;promulgated by the authority of Pope Paul VI and revised at the direction of Pope John Paul II&#x27;).

== Names ==

In its official documents, the Catholic Church identifies the forms of the Roman Rite Mass by the editions of the Roman Missal used in celebrating them. Thus Pope Benedict XVI referred to this form of the Roman Rite Mass by linking it, in his of 7 July 2007, with &quot;the Roman Missal promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1970&quot; or, in his accompanying letter of the same date to the bishops of the church, &quot;the Missal published by Paul VI and then republished in two subsequent editions by John Paul II&quot;.

The now less frequently used names &#x27;Mass of Paul VI&#x27; and &#x27;Pauline Mass&#x27; refer to Pope Paul VI, who promulgated the first edition (which was followed by later editions promulgated by Pope John Paul II).

In his letter to bishops which accompanied his 2007 , Pope Benedict XVI wrote that &quot;the Missal published by Paul VI and then republished in two subsequent editions by John Paul II, obviously is and continues to be the normal Form – the – of the Eucharistic Liturgy.&quot; Since then, the term &quot;Ordinary Form&quot; (abbreviated OF) is used to distinguish this form of the Roman Rite of Mass from the 1962 edition of the Tridentine Mass, the &quot;Extraordinary Form&quot; (EF), because in his Pope Benedict declared the latter an &quot;extraordinary form&quot; of the Roman Rite. Pope Francis further emphasized the importance of the Ordinary Form in this capacity with his 2021 , referring to it as &quot;the unique expression of the of the Roman Rite.&quot;

==Text==
The current official text in Latin is that in the third typical edition of the Roman Missal, published in 2002 and reprinted with corrections and updating in 2008. Translations into the vernacular languages have appeared; the current English translation was promulgated in 2010 and was introduced progressively from September 2011. Two earlier typical editions of the Missal were issued in 1970 (promulgated in 1969) and 1975. The liturgy contained in the 1570–1962 editions of the Roman Missal is frequently referred to as the Tridentine Mass: all these editions placed at the start the text of the papal bull in which Pope Pius V linked the issuance of his edition of the Roman Missal to the Council of Trent. Only in the 1962 edition is this text preceded by a short decree, , declaring that edition to be, from then on, the typical edition, to which other printings of the Missal were to conform.

The Roman Missal promulged by John Paul II differs in many points from that promulged by Paul VI. The changes include the addition of 13 new feasts of saints, a new preface of martyrs, several new Mass formulas, including five of the Blessed Virgin Mary, two votive Masses (one of which was taken from the 1962 Roman Missal), and complete formulas for the ferial days of Advent and Eastertide. Prayers over the faithful are added to the Lenten Mass formulas and the Apostles&#x27; Creed is provided as an alternative to the Nicene Creed. The Mass of Paul VI thus became the Mass of Paul VI and John Paul II.

==History==

=== Background ===

==== Liturgical Movement ====
The Liturgical Movement of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which arose from the work of Dom Prosper Guéranger, a former abbot of Solesmes Abbey, encouraged the laity to live the liturgy by attending services (not only Mass) often, understanding what they meant, and following the priest in heart and mind.

==== Beginnings of the modern revision, 1948–1962 ====
Liturgical reforms took place under Pius XII, specially in 1955, when the liturgy of Holy Week was reformed.

===Vatican II, , and a revised liturgy===
The liturgy was the first matter considered by the Second Vatican Council of 1962–1965. On 4 December 1963, the Council issued a Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy known as , section 50 of which read as follows:

 further provided that (amongst other things) a greater use of the Scriptures should be made at Mass, communion under both kinds for the laity (under limited circumstances), and that vernacular languages should be more widely employed (while retaining the use of Latin), a declaration whose implementation made the Second Vatican Council &quot;a milestone for Catholic, Protestants, [and] the Orthodox&quot;. 

In 1964, Pope Paul VI, who had succeeded John XXIII the previous year, established the , the Council for Implementing the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy. The instruction of 26 September 1964, issued by the Sacred Congregation of Rites while the Council was still in session, and coming into effect on 7 March 1965 made significant changes to the existing liturgy. The 1967 document , the second instruction on the implementation of the Council&#x27;s Constitution on the Liturgy, made only minimal changes to the text, but simplified the rubrics and the vestments. Concelebration and Communion under both kinds had meanwhile been permitted.

By October 1967, the Consilium had produced a complete draft revision of the Mass liturgy, known as the Normative Mass, and this revision was presented to the Synod of Bishops that met in Rome in that month. The bishops attended the first public celebration of the revised rite in the Sistine Chapel. When asked to vote on the new liturgy, 71 bishops voted (&#x27;approved&#x27;), 43 voted (&#x27;not approved&#x27;), and 62 voted (&#x27;approved with reservations&#x27;). In response to the bishops&#x27; concerns, some changes were made to the text. Pope Paul VI and the Consilium interpreted this as lack of approval for the Normative Mass, which was replaced by the text included in the book (The New Order of Mass) in 1969.

On 25 September 1969, two retired cardinals, 79-year-old Alfredo Ottaviani and 84-year-old Antonio Bacci, wrote a letter with which they sent Pope Paul VI the text of the &quot;Short Critical Study on the New Order of Mass&quot;. The cardinals warned the New Order of the Mass &quot;represented, both as a whole and in its details, a striking departure from the Catholic theology of the Mass as it was formulated in Session XXII of the Council of Trent&quot;. The study that they transmitted said that on many points the New Mass had much to gladden the heart of even the most modernist Protestant. Paul VI asked the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the department of the Roman Curia that Ottaviani had earlier headed, to examine the Short Critical Study. It responded on 12 November 1969 that the document contained many affirmations that were &quot;superficial, exaggerated, inexact, emotional, and false&quot;. However, some of its observations were taken into account in preparing the definitive version of the new Order of the Mass. In 1974, Annibale Bugnini announced that the was &quot;a major conquest of the Roman Catholic Church.&quot; Ottaviani would later acknowledge his satisfaction with the new missal after reassurance by Paul VI in a letter dated February 17, 1970.

===Paul VI&#x27;s publication of the 1970 Missal===
Pope Paul VI promulgated the revised rite of Mass with his apostolic constitution of 3 April 1969, setting the first Sunday of Advent at the end of that year as the date on which it would enter into force. However, because he was dissatisfied with the edition that was produced, the revised Missal itself was not published until the following year, and full vernacular translations appeared much later.

The revisions called for by Vatican II were guided by historical and Biblical studies that were not available at the Council of Trent when the rite was fixed to forestall any heretical accretions. made particular mention of the following significant changes from the previous edition of the Roman Missal:

* &quot;Other elements that have suffered injury through accident of history&quot; are restored &quot;to the tradition of the Fathers&quot; (SC art. 50), for example, the homily (see SC art. 52), the general intercessions or prayer of the faithful (see SC art. 53), and the penitential rite or act of reconciliation with God and the community at the beginning of the Mass.
* The proportion of the Bible read at Mass was greatly increased, although some verses included in the older readings have been omitted in the new. Before the reforms of Pius XII, which reduced the proportions further, 1% of the Old Testament and 16.5% of the New Testament had been read at Mass. Since 1970, the equivalent proportions for Sundays and weekdays (leaving aside major feasts) have been 13.5% of the Old Testament and 71.5% of the New Testament.

==Other changes==

===Vernacular language===
In his 1962 apostolic constitution on the teaching of Latin, Pope John XXIII spoke of that language as the one the church uses: &quot;The Catholic Church has a dignity far surpassing that of every merely human society, for it was founded by Christ the Lord. It is altogether fitting, therefore, that the language it uses should be noble, majestic, and non-vernacular.&quot; However, the only mention of the liturgy in that document was in relation to the study of Greek.

The Second Vatican Council stated in , 36:

At the same time, 54 makes clear that, though the vernacular is permitted, &quot;steps should be taken so that the faithful may also be able to say or to sing together in Latin those parts of the Ordinary of the Mass which pertain to them.&quot;

===Three new Eucharistic Prayers===
As noted above, three new Eucharistic Prayers were introduced as alternatives to the Roman Canon (known as &quot;Eucharistic Prayer I&quot; within the missal), which had for 1,600 years been the only Eucharistic Prayer of the Roman Rite. After , between the years 1963 and 1968 there were private initiatives by liberal reformers to either revise the Roman Canon, or to create new Eucharistic Prayers. Hans Küng and Karl Amon both published articles demanding this. In addition, the Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Netherlands under Johannes Bluyssen, around 1965–1966, did not wait for the Canon to be permitted in the vernacular and started experimenting with their own translations and adding new &quot;Eucharistic Prayers&quot;, then asking for permission from Rome to do so after the fact, causing political pressure. Benedictine member of the Cipriano Vagaggini, while noting what he called the Roman Canon&#x27;s &quot;undeniable defects&quot;, concluded that its suppression was unthinkable; he proposed that it be retained but that two further Eucharistic Prayers be added. The &quot;General Instruction of the Roman Missal&quot; of 1969 states that the &quot;Eucharistic Prayer I&quot; (the Roman Canon) may always be used, including on Sundays, but it rarely is in local diocesan parishes since 1969–1970.

In response to requests from various quarters, Pope Paul VI authorized the composition of new Eucharistic Prayers, which were examined by himself and by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and which he authorized for use in 1968.

The original Bugnini draft, drawing from the skeleton which is typically thought to be the lost Apostolic Tradition of Hyppolitus but is also considered to be of later, non-Roman origin, would have excluded even the and the intercessions. The &quot;General Instruction of the Roman Missal&quot; of 1969 states that Eucharistic Prayer II is &quot;useful on weekdays.&quot;

The Third Eucharistic Prayer&#x27;s structure follows the Roman Canon. It is based on the 4th-century Anaphora of St Basil. Both the Third and Fourth Eucharistic Prayers were created by Cipriano Vagaggini of the Pontifical Athenaeum of Saint Anselm at Rome in 1966.

===Communion under both species===
A council at Lambeth in 1281 directed that the people were to be given unconsecrated wine. The Council of Trent taught that only the priest who celebrated Mass was bound by divine law to receive Communion under both species, and that Christ, whole and entire, and a true sacrament are received under either form alone, and therefore, as regards its fruits, those who receive one species only are not deprived of any grace necessary to salvation; and it decreed: &quot;If anyone says that the holy Catholic Church was not moved by just causes and reasons that laymen and clerics when not consecrating should communicate under the form of bread only, or has erred in this, let him be anathema.&quot; While the Council had declared that reception of Communion under one form alone deprived the communicant of no grace necessary to salvation, the 1908 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states theologians had surmised that receiving both forms may confer a greater grace, either in itself (a minority view) or only accidentally (the majority view).

=== Liturgical orientation ===

The Tridentine Missal speaks of celebrating , and gives corresponding instructions for the priest when performing actions that in the other orientation involved turning around in order to face the people.

In &quot;The Spirit of the Liturgy&quot;, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) attributed to the influence of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica the fact that other churches in Rome are built with the apse to the west and also attributed to topographical circumstances that arrangement for Saint Peter&#x27;s. However, the arrangement whereby the apse with the altar is at the west end of the church and the entrance on the east is found also in Roman churches contemporary with Saint Peter&#x27;s (such as the original Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls) that were under no such constraints of terrain, and the same arrangement remained the usual one until the 6th century. In this early layout, the people were situated in the side aisles of the church, not in the central nave. While the priest faced both the altar and east throughout the Mass, the people would face the altar (from the sides) until the high point of the Mass, where they would then turn to face east along with the priest.

In its guidelines for the arrangement of churches, the current Roman Missal directs: &quot;The altar should be built apart from the wall, in such a way that it is possible to walk around it easily and that Mass can be celebrated at it facing the people, which is desirable wherever possible.&quot; The English also states that both the construction of the altar away from the wall and the celebration are &quot;desirable wherever possible.&quot; A 2000 statement by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments stated that &quot;There is no preference expressed in the liturgical legislation for either position. As both positions enjoy the favor of law, the legislation may not be invoked to say that one position or the other accords more closely with the mind of the Church.&quot;

The rubrics of the Roman Missal now prescribe that the priest should face the people at six points of the Mass. The priest celebrating the Tridentine Mass was required to face the people, turning his back to the altar if necessary, eight times.

=== Repositioning of the tabernacle ===
The revised Roman Missal states that it is &quot;more appropriate as a sign that on an altar on which Mass is celebrated there not be a tabernacle in which the Most Holy Eucharist is reserved&quot;, in which case it is &quot;preferable that the tabernacle be located&quot;:

* Either in the sanctuary, apart from the altar of celebration, in an appropriate form and place, not excluding its being positioned on an old altar no longer used for celebration;
* Or in some chapel suitable for the private adoration and prayer of the faithful and organically connected to the church and readily noticeable to the Christian faithful.

The Missal does direct that the tabernacle be situated &quot;in a part of the church that is truly noble, prominent, conspicuous, worthily decorated, and suitable for prayer&quot;.

=== Changes to the role of the deacon ===

In the ( Tridentine Form) the liturgical role of the deacon was largely limited to his role in the ( the Solemn High Mass) and some rites in the . Furthermore, in the the deacon&#x27;s role was rarely used apart from the subdeacon. In the Mass of Paul VI, the deacon was now to be included (if he was present), at any level of solemnity, and not just the solemn form of the Mass. Furthermore, it was often the practice in the , that the role of the deacon and subdeacon were filled by clerics who were actually ordained as priests or bishops (additionally, sometimes the subdeacon&#x27;s role was performed by minor clerics who were not yet subdeacons, a practice called a &quot;straw&quot; subdeacon). However, the Missal of Paul VI required that the role of the deacon be filled by one who was, in fact, a deacon (and not a priest or bishop). This restriction of the role of the deacon to clerics who were, in fact, only deacons makes sense in light of the restoration of the Latin deaconate to a stable ministry – as opposed to the inherited practice of the deacon being almost entirely (except for a few, limited cases) a transitional phase to the priesthood. Nonetheless, the practice of bishops and priests assuming the vestments and roles of deacons does continue in some papal ceremonies.

When the deacon proclaimed the Gospel at Mass, it was no longer proclaimed facing the side of the sanctuary, also known as liturgical North, (symbolizing the announcement of the Gospel to the unevangelized), but rather from the &quot;ambo&quot; towards the people. Furthermore, the priest no longer had to read the Gospel before the deacon proclaimed it, the subdeacon (being soon eliminated) no longer held the Book of the Gospels ( &quot;Evangelium&quot;), and the Gospel no longer had to be sung by the deacon, but could (optionally) be read.
Having been lost by the time of the Leonine Sacramentary in 560 A.D., the ( Prayer of the Faithful) was restored to its former location after the Creed and before the Offertory (indicated in the by the priest turning immediately before the Offertory, and saying and the immediately proceeding to the Offertory), as a properly deacon&#x27;s part. However, in practice the intentions in the are still commonly read by laypersons (sometimes even when deacons are present, contrary to directives). The may be sung in the style of a litany, with provided music in the 2002 .

The deacon&#x27;s duties at the Offertory also changed. Absent the subdeacon after 1972, the deacon was responsible for placing both the wine and the water into the chalice (instead of having the subdeacon place the water in the chalice). After presenting the chalice to the priest, the deacon formerly (in the ) would support either the priest&#x27;s arm or the base of the chalice and saying with the priest, , but in the Missal of Paul VI, the deacon presents the chalice to the priest, who offers it alone, saying 

=== Changes to the subdeacon ===

From its promulgation in 1969 to 1972 the Mass of Paul VI had briefly included a subdeacon, whose task it was to &quot;serve at the altar and to assist the priest and deacon. In particular he prepares the altar and the sacred vessels and reads the epistle.&quot; However, it was soon eliminated due to the suppression of subdiaconate by Pope Paul VI in 1972 in the .

===Other matters===
A procession is now allowed at the Offertory or Presentation of the Gifts, when bread, wine, and water are brought to the altar. The homily has been made an integral part of the Mass instead of being treated as an adjunct, and the ancient Prayer of the Faithful has been restored. The exchange of a sign of peace before Communion, previously limited to the clergy at High Mass, is permitted (not made obligatory) at every Mass, even for the laity. &quot;As for the actual sign of peace to be given, the manner is to be established by Conferences of Bishops in accordance with the culture and customs of the peoples. However, it is appropriate that each person, in a sober manner, offer the sign of peace only to those who are nearest.&quot; (&quot;GIRM&quot;, 82.) &quot;While the Sign of Peace is being given, it is permissible to say, &quot;The peace of the Lord be with you always&quot;, to which the reply is &quot;Amen&quot;&quot; (&quot;GIRM&quot;, 154).

==Criticism of the revision==
There are two distinct forms of criticisms of the liturgical reform: criticisms of the text of the revised Missal and criticisms of ways in which the rite has been celebrated in practice.

===Criticisms of the text of the Missal===

==== Ottaviani Intervention ====
In 1969 Cardinals Alfredo Ottaviani and Antonio Bacci sent to Pope Paul VI a &quot;Short Critical Study of the&quot; , commonly known as the &quot;Ottaviani Intervention&quot;. In it, they described the new Missal as &quot;a striking departure from the Catholic theology of the Holy Mass, as it was formulated by the Council of Trent&quot;. The mind behind the document is alleged to be theologian Michel-Louis Guérard des Lauriers, who later became a sedeprivationist bishop and was excommunicated.

Pope Paul VI asked the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the department of the Roman Curia that Ottaviani had earlier headed, to examine the Short Critical Study. It responded on 12 November 1969 that the document contained many affirmations that were &quot;superficial, exaggerated, inexact, emotional and false&quot;. Nonetheless, the contents of the Intervention were used by Paul VI to amend the Missal and remove the most controversial parts from it; Cardinal Ottaviani later stated to be satisfied by the amendments.

==== Other criticism ====
In his preface to the French edition of &quot;The Reform of the Roman Liturgy&quot; by Klaus Gamber, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI, said: &quot;In the place of liturgy as the fruit of development came fabricated liturgy. We abandoned the organic, living process of growth and development over the centuries and replaced it – as in a manufacturing process – with a fabrication, a banal on-the-spot product.&quot; As Pope Benedict, he later wrote: &quot;There is no contradiction between the two editions of the Roman Missal. In the history of the liturgy there is growth and progress, but no rupture.&quot;

The Society of Saint Pius X has argued that the promulgation of the revised liturgy was legally invalid due to alleged technical deficiencies in the wording of . However, the Society has later stated that the Mass of Paul VI is valid, though illicit.

===Related worship controversies===
==Revision of the English translation==
The International Commission on English in the Liturgy worked for 17 years on a new translation, presented in 1998, formed in response to critiques of the earlier translation. However, their proposed translation ran afoul of new leadership in Rome. On 28 March 2001, the Holy See issued the Instruction , including the requirement that, in translations of the liturgical texts from the official Latin originals, &quot;the original text, insofar as possible, must be translated integrally and in the most exact manner, without omissions or additions in terms of their content, and without paraphrases or glosses. Any adaptation to the characteristics or the nature of the various vernacular languages is to be sober and discreet.&quot; The following year, the third typical edition of the revised Roman Missal in Latin was released.

In 2002 the leadership of the ICEL was changed, under insistence from the Roman Congregation for Divine Worship and to obtain a translation that was as close as possible to the wording of the Latin original. In spite of push-back by some in the church, Rome prevailed and nine years later a new English translation, closer to that of the Latin and consequently approved by the Holy See, was adopted by English-speaking episcopal conferences.

Most episcopal conferences set the first Sunday in Advent (27 November) 2011 as the date when the new translation would come into use. However, the Southern African Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference (Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland) put into effect the changes in the people&#x27;s parts of the revised English translation of the Order of Mass from 28 November 2008, when the Missal as a whole was not yet available. Protests were voiced on grounds of content and because it meant that Southern Africa was thus out of line with other English-speaking areas. One bishop claimed that the English-speaking conferences should have withstood the Holy See&#x27;s insistence on a more literal translation. However, when in February 2009 the Holy See declared that the change should have waited until the whole of the Missal had been translated, the bishops&#x27; conference appealed, with the result that those parishes that had adopted the new translation of the Order of Mass were directed to continue using it, while those that had not were told to await further instructions before doing so.

In December 2016, Pope Francis authorized a commission to study , the document promulgated by Pope John Paul II which governs authorized vernacular translations of the liturgy.

<text>Riccardo Giacconi ( , ; October 6, 1931 – December 9, 2018) was an Italian-American Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist who laid down the foundations of X-ray astronomy. He was a professor at the Johns Hopkins University.

== Biography ==
Born in Genoa, Italy, Giacconi received his Laurea from the Physics Department of University of Milan before moving to the US to pursue a career in astrophysics research. In 1956, his Fulbright Fellowship led him to go to the United States to collaborate with physics professor R. W. Thompson at Indiana University.

Since cosmic X-ray radiation is absorbed by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, space-based telescopes are needed for X-ray astronomy. Applying himself to this problem, Giacconi worked on the instrumentation for X-ray astronomy; from rocket-borne detectors in the late 1950s and early 1960s, to Uhuru, the first orbiting X-ray astronomy satellite, in the 1970s. Giacconi&#x27;s pioneering research continued in 1978 with the Einstein Observatory, the first fully imaging X-ray telescope put into space, and later with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was launched in 1999 and is still in operation.

Giacconi applied his expertise to other fields of astronomy, becoming the first permanent director (1981-1993) of the Space Telescope Science Institute (the science operations center for the Hubble Space Telescope). This was followed by Director General of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) from 1993 to 1999, overseeing the construction of the Very Large Telescope, then President of Associated Universities, Inc. (1999-2004) managing the early years of the ALMA array.

Giacconi was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002 &quot;for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic X-ray sources&quot;. The other shares of the Prize in that year were awarded to Masatoshi Koshiba and Raymond Davis, Jr. for neutrino astronomy.

Giacconi held the positions of professor of physics and astronomy (1982–1997) and research professor (from 1998 to his death in 2018) at Johns Hopkins University, and was a university professor. During the 2000s he was principal investigator for the major Chandra Deep Field-South project with NASA&#x27;s Chandra X-ray Observatory. Giacconi died on December 9, 2018.

<doc id="101140" wikidata="Q2916316" url="?curid=101140" title="Cultural resource management">
<text>In the broadest sense, cultural resource management (CRM) is the vocation and practice of managing heritage assets, and other cultural resources such as contemporary art. It incorporates Cultural Heritage Management which is concerned with traditional and historic culture. It also delves into the material culture of archaeology. Cultural resource management encompasses current culture, including progressive and innovative culture, such as urban culture, rather than simply preserving and presenting traditional forms of culture.

However, the broad usage of the term is relatively recent and as a result it is most often used as synonymous with heritage management. In the United States, cultural resources management is not usually diverse from the heritage context. The term is, &quot;used mostly by archaeologists and much more occasionally by architectural historians and historical architects, to refer to managing historic places of archaeological, architectural, and historical interests and considering such places in compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws.&quot;

Cultural resources include both physical assets such as archaeology, architecture, paintings and sculptures and also intangible culture such as folklore and interpretative arts, such as storytelling and drama. Cultural resource managers are typically in charge of museums, galleries, theatres etc., especially those that emphasize culture specific to the local region or ethnic group. Cultural tourism is a significant sector of the tourism industry.

At a national and international level, cultural resource management may be concerned with larger themes, such as languages in danger of extinction, public education, the ethos or operation of multiculturalism, and promoting access to cultural resources. The Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity is an attempt by the United Nations to identify exemplars of intangible culture.

==Background==
Federal legislation had passed earlier in 1906 under the Antiquities Act, but it was not until the 1970s when the term &quot;cultural resources&quot; was coined by the National Park Service. The Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974, commonly known as the Moss-Bennett Act, helped to fuel the creation of CRM. The National Park Service defines cultural resources as being &quot;Physical evidence or place of past human activity: site, object, landscape, structure; or a site, structure, landscape, object or natural feature of significance to a group of people traditionally associated with it.&quot;

==Cultural resource management applied to heritage management==

Cultural resource management in the heritage context is mainly concerned with the investigation of sites with archaeological potential, the preservation and interpretation of historic sites and artifacts, and the culture of indigenous people. The subject developed from initiatives in rescue archaeology, sensitivities to the treatment of indigenous people, and subsequent legislation to protect cultural heritage.

Current cultural resource management laws and practices in the United States addresses the following resources:
* Historic properties (as listed or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places)
* Older properties that may have cultural value, but may or may not be eligible for the National Register
* Spiritual places
*Cultural landscapes
*Archaeological sites
*Shipwrecks, submerged aircraft
*Native American graves and cultural items
*Historical documents
*Archaeological and historical artifacts
*Religious sites
*Religious practices
*Cultural use of natural resources
*Folklife, tradition, and other social institutions

A significant proportion of the archaeological investigation in countries that have heritage management legislation including the United States and United Kingdom is conducted on sites under threat of development. In the US, such investigations are now done by private companies on a consulting basis, and a national organization exists to support the practice of CRM. Museums, besides being popular tourist attractions, often play roles in conservation of, and research on, threatened sites, including as repositories for collections from sites slated for destruction.

==National Register eligibility==
In the United States, a common Cultural Resource Management task is the implementation of a Section 106 review: CRM archaeologists determine whether federally funded projects are likely to damage or destroy archaeological sites that may be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. This process commonly entails one or more archaeological field surveys.

==Careers in CRM==
Cultural resource management features people from a wide array of disciplines. The general education of most involved in CRM includes, but is not limited to, sociology, archaeology, architectural history, cultural anthropology, social and cultural geography, and other fields in the social sciences.

In the field of cultural resource management there are many career choices. One could obtain a career with an action agency that works directly with the NEPA or even more specifically, Native American resources. There are also careers that can be found in review agencies like the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), or the state historic preservation office (SHPO). Beyond these choices, one could also obtain a career as part of the local government and work with planning agencies, housing agencies, social service agencies, local museums, libraries, or educational institutions. Jobs at private cultural resource management companies can range from field technicians (see shovelbum) to principal investigators, project archaeologists, historic preservationists, and laboratory work. One could also become a part of an advocacy organization, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

==Debates==
It is commonly debated in cultural resource management how to determine whether cultural or archaeological sites should be considered significant or not. The criteria that is stated by the National Register of Historic Places is said to be able to be &quot;interpreted in different ways so that the significance... may be subjectively argued for many cultural resources.&quot; Another issue that arises among scholars is that &quot;protection does not necessarily mean preservation.&quot; Any public projects occurring near the cultural resource can have adverse effects. Development plans for a proposed project may not be able to be changed to limit impact and to avoid damage to the resource.

==Management of cultural organizations==
The vocation of management in cultural and creative sectors is the subject of research and improvement initiatives, by organizations such as Arts and Business which take a partnership approach to involving professional business people in running and mentoring arts organizations. Some universities now offer vocational degrees.

The management of cultural heritage is underpinned by academic research in archaeology, ethnography and history. The broader subject is also underpinned by research in sociology and culture studies.

==Anthropology==

Understanding the traditional cultures of all peoples is essential in mitigating the adverse impact of development and ensuring that intervention by more developed nations is not prejudicial to the interests of local people or results in the extinction of cultural resources.

==Cultural resources policies==
Cultural resources policies have developed over time with the recognition of the economic and social importance of heritage and other cultural assets.

The exploitation of cultural resources can be controversial, particularly where the finite cultural heritage resources of developing countries are exported to satisfy the demand for antiquities market in the developed world. The exploitation of the potential intellectual property of traditional remedies in identifying candidates for new drugs has also been controversial. On the other hand, traditional crafts can be important elements of income from tourism, performance of traditional dances, and music that is popular with tourists and traditional designs can be exploited in the fashion industry. Popular culture can also be an important economic asset.

<text>The governor of the State of Maryland is the head of government of Maryland, and is the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s National Guard units. The governor is the highest-ranking official in the state and has a broad range of appointive powers in both the state and local governments, as specified by the Maryland Constitution (1867, and revisions/amendments).

The current governor is Wes Moore, who has been in office since 2023.

==Selection and qualifications==
Like most state chief executives in the United States, the governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the governor can run any number of times, but not more than twice in a row. This makes it possible for a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. Candidates meeting this minimum requirement must file with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body. The governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for president of the United States does not occur.

==Functions and responsibilities==
As the chief executive of the State of Maryland, the governor heads the executive branch of government, which includes all state executive departments and agencies, as well as advisory boards, commissions, committees, and task forces. The main constitutional responsibility of the governor of Maryland, and any other state&#x27;s chief executive, is to carry out the business of the state and to enforce the laws passed by the legislature. The governor also has some say in these laws, since the governor has the ability to veto any bill sent to his or her desk by the Maryland General Assembly, though the assembly may override that veto. The governor is also given a number of more specific powers as relates to appropriations of state funds, the appointment of state officials, and also a variety of less prominent and less commonly utilized powers.

===Appropriations===
Every year, the governor must present a proposed budget to the Maryland General Assembly. After receiving the proposed budget, the assembly is then allowed to decrease any portion of the budget for the executive branch, but it may never increase it or transfer funds between executive departments. The assembly may, however, increase funds for the legislative and judicial branches of government. The governor has the power to veto any law that is passed by the General Assembly, including a &quot;line item veto&quot;, which can be used to strike certain portions of appropriations bills. The legislature then has the power to override a governor&#x27;s veto by vote of three-fifths (60%) of the number of members in each house.

The governor also sits on the board of public works, whose other two members are the comptroller and the treasurer. This board has broad powers in overseeing and approving the spending of state funds. They must approve state expenditures of all general funds and capital improvement funds, excluding expenditures for the construction of state roads, bridges, and highways. It has the power to solicit loans on its own accord either to meet a deficit or in anticipation of other revenues, in addition to approving expenditures of funds from loans authorized by the General Assembly.

===Appointment powers===
The governor appoints almost all military and civil officers of the state government, subject to advice and consent of the Maryland State Senate. The governor also appoints certain boards and commissions in each of the 24 counties and in Baltimore City, such as local Boards of Elections, commissions notaries public, and appoints officers to fill vacancies in the elected offices of attorney general and comptroller. Should a vacancy arise in either of the two houses of the General Assembly, the governor also fills that vacancy, though the governor must choose from among the recommendations of the local party organization to which the person leaving the vacancy belonged. Any officer appointed by the governor, except a member of the General Assembly, is removable by him or her, if there is a legitimate cause for removal. Among the most prominent of the governor&#x27;s appointees are the 24 secretaries and heads of departments that currently make up the governor&#x27;s Cabinet, also known as the executive council.

===Executive council===
The governor of Maryland is the chairman of the governor&#x27;s executive council (or Cabinet) which coordinates all state government functions. This is composed of the following members, all of whom, except the lieutenant governor, are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Maryland State Senate as heads of executive departments:
*Lieutenant governor – Aruna Miller
*Secretary of State – Susan C. Lee
*Secretary of Aging – Carmel Roques
*Secretary of Agriculture – Kevin Atticks
*Secretary of Budget and Management – Helene Grady
*Secretary of Commerce – Harry Coker
*Secretary of Disabilities – Carol Beatty
*State Superintendent of Schools (appointed by the State Board of Education to direct the Maryland State Department of Education) – Carey Wright
*Secretary of Environment – Serena McIlwain
*Secretary of General Services – Atif Chaudhry
*Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene – Laura Herrera Scott
*Secretary of Housing and Community Development – Jacob R. Day
*Secretary of Human Resources – Rafael López
*Secretary of Information Technology – Katie Savage
*Secretary of Juvenile Services – Vincent Schiraldi
*Secretary of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation – Portia Wu
*Secretary of Natural Resources – Josh Kurtz
*Secretary of Planning – Rebecca Flora
*Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services – Carolyn Scruggs
*Secretary of State Police (commanding officer of the Maryland State Police) – Roland Butler
*Secretary of Transportation – Paul Wiedefeld
*Secretary of Veterans Affairs – Anthony Woods
*Secretary of Higher Education (head of the Maryland Higher Education Commission) – Sanjay Rai
*Secretary of Service and Civic Innovation - Paul Monteiro
*Adjutant General (head of the Maryland Military Department) – Janeen L. Birckhead

Other members of the governor&#x27;s staff may be invited to Cabinet meetings as &quot;attendees&quot;.

The governor also oversees several sub-cabinets that coordinate the activities of a certain function of state government that involves several state departments or agencies. Currently, these are the Base Realignment and Closure Subcabinet, BayStat Subcabinet, Chesapeake Bay cabinet, Children&#x27;s Cabinet, Governor&#x27;s Subcabinet for International Affairs, Smart Growth Subcabinet, and Workforce Creation Subcabinet.

===Other powers and responsibilities===
The governor is the commander-in-chief of the military forces of the state: the Maryland Army National Guard and Air National Guard and the Maryland Defense Force, except when the former of these forces have been called into federal service, which the President of the United States has the authority to do. In times of public emergency, the governor may exercise emergency powers, including the mobilization of these military forces. In the area of criminal justice, the governor may grant pardons to criminals, commute the sentences of prisoners, or remit fines and forfeitures imposed on people who have been convicted, jailed, or fined for violations of state laws.

In both these areas, and a variety of others, the governor sits on state and interstate boards and commissions with varying powers. The governor is also obligated to report on the conditions of the state at any time during the year, though this traditionally happens in a &quot;State of the State&quot; address each January at the beginning of the annual General Assembly session.

===The governor&#x27;s staff===
In addition to the various departments and agencies under gubernatorial control, the governor has an executive administrative staff that assist in coordinating the executive duties. This staff is led by a chief of staff, and includes five offices: Intergovernmental Relations, Legal Counsel, Legislative and Policy, Press, and the Governor&#x27;s Office in Washington, D.C. The chief of staff has a number of deputies to assist in running these departments. The governor&#x27;s staff is appointed and therefore largely exempt from state civil service laws.

==History and evolution of the office==

===1600s–1800s===

During the colonial period, Maryland&#x27;s proprietors, the Barons and Lords of Baltimore, who generally remained in the Kingdom of England, chose who would serve as the proprietary governor of Maryland on their behalf. Leonard Calvert (1606–1647), youngest brother of the second Lord Baltimore, Cecilius Calvert (1605–1675), and the first lord proprietor, came with the first settlers in March 1634 to serve as the first governor of the colonial Province of Maryland until his death in 1647. Between 1692, when the Baltimores lost control, and 1715, Maryland was a direct royal colony, and the governor was appointed by the British monarch. The Lords of Baltimore regained their royal charter in 1715, under the British monarchs of the House of Hanover, and then under the fifth and sixth Lord Baltimores, they resumed choosing the governors until the beginning of the American Revolution (1775–1783). The first governor of an independent state chosen to break this chain of colonial governors was Thomas Johnson (1732–1819) of Frederick County, who took office on March 21, 1777.

Under the first Maryland Constitution of 1776 for the independent state, the governor was chosen for one-year terms by both houses of the General Assembly. An 1838 constitutional amendment allowed voters to elect the governor to a three-year term from one of three rotating gubernatorial districts: eastern, southern, and western parts of the state. At each election, only voters from a single gubernatorial election district selected the governor. A four-year term was established by the second Maryland Constitution of 1851, and geographic requirements were removed by the third Constitution of 1864 during the American Civil War. The fourth and current constitution was ratified by the people after the war in 1867. An amendment in 1922, added article XVII, title &quot;Quadrennial Elections&quot;, to the 1867 state constitution and set the next election year to be 1926 and every four years thereafter, thereby shifting from the historical off-year cycle (...1915, 1919, 1923) to the present mid-term election cycle.

From 1777 to 1870, the governor resided in the Jennings House in Annapolis. Located on the site of the future expanded campus of the adjacent United States Naval Academy (founded 1845), the house was later sold to the academy in 1869 after it returned from its northern hiatus in Rhode Island during the American Civil War (1861–1865). It was razed in 1901 for additional USNA buildings. Since 1870, the governor of Maryland has resided in the Government House, originally a Victorian style architecture red brick mansion (later rebuilt/renovated in the 1930s into a Georgian-styled mansion to match other colonial/Georgian-Federal era styled architecture state buildings and residences in the historic city). It is located on State Circle adjacent to the colonial era Maryland State House built 1772–1797. In addition to being the residence of the governor and his family, Government House has a number of public rooms that are used by the governor on official occasions.

===1900s–present===
Spiro Agnew, who was the 55th governor of Maryland from 1967 to 1969, later served as the 39th vice president of the United States under President Richard M. Nixon. Agnew is, thus far, the highest-ranking Marylander (along with 19th-century chief justice Roger B. Taney) in public service in the history of the United States. He resigned after pleading &quot;no contest&quot; to federal legal charges of corruption during his terms as Baltimore County executive, Maryland governor and vice president. In 1979, his gubernatorial portrait was removed from the Maryland State House Governor&#x27;s Reception Room. In 1995, then-governor Parris Glendening re-included the portrait, stating that it was not up to anyone to alter history, whether for good or bad, citing the famous novel by George Orwell, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. 
As of 2023, Maryland has not yet had a female governor. However, women were the runners-up in four gubernatorial elections (in 1974, 1994, 1998, and 2002), three Republicans and one Democrat. In addition, two women have been the lieutenant governor; Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, under Democratic governor Parris Glendening from 1995 to 2003; and Aruna Miller, under Democratic governor Wes Moore since 2023. Another woman, Kristen Cox, who was the Secretary of Disabilities, unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor as the running mate of then incumbent Republican governor Robert Ehrlich, when the lieutenant governor at that time, Michael Steele, left office to run for the U.S. Senate. Cox was a unique person to run for that office, not only because she is a woman, but also because she is legally blind.

==Lieutenant governor==

In 1971, the office of Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, which had existed for only a few years in the 1860s, was re-instituted by an amendment to the Maryland Constitution. The lieutenant governor is a weak office compared to other counterparts (in other states including Texas, the lieutenant governor is the president of the state&#x27;s Senate, while in California the lieutenant governor assumes all of the governor&#x27;s powers when the sitting governor is out of the state), as it only possesses the powers and duties that the governor assigns to him or her. The lieutenant governor is elected on the same ballot with the governor, and to the same term of office as the governor. The lieutenant governor succeeds to the governorship only if there is a vacancy in that office.

Despite the governor and lieutenant governor being elected on the same party ticket, very often there have been public rifts between the two; for instance Gov. Marvin Mandel and Lt. Gov. Blair Lee III; Gov. Harry R. Hughes and Lt. Gov. Samuel W. Bogley III; Gov. Schaefer and Lt. Gov. Melvin A. Steinberg., and Gov. Parris Glendening and Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.
 No lieutenant governor of Maryland has yet been elected as the governor in future elections, or permanently succeeded to the governor&#x27;s office due to a vacancy (which would be created by the resignation, death, or removal of the sitting governor), although Blair Lee III served as acting governor from June 4, 1977, until January 15, 1979, while Governor Marvin Mandel was serving a sentence for mail fraud and racketeering (consequently, in a modern example of &quot;Damnatio memoriae&quot;, Mandel&#x27;s official gubernatorial portrait was not hung in the Maryland State House Governor&#x27;s Reception Room until 1993).

<text>The Tongva ( ) are an Indigenous people of California from the Los Angeles Basin and the Southern Channel Islands, an area covering approximately . In the precolonial era, the people lived in as many as 100 villages and primarily identified by their village rather than by a pan-tribal name. During colonization, the Spanish referred to these people as Gabrieleño and Fernandeño, names derived from the Spanish missions built on their land: Mission San Gabriel Arcángel and Mission San Fernando Rey de España. &quot;Tongva&quot; is the most widely circulated endonym among the people, used by Narcisa Higuera in 1905 to refer to inhabitants in the vicinity of Mission San Gabriel. Some people who identify as direct lineal descendants of the people advocate the use of their ancestral name &quot;Kizh&quot; as an endonym.

The Tongva, along with neighboring groups such as the Chumash, played an important role in the cultural and economic dynamics of the region at the time of European encounter. They had developed an extensive trade network through &quot;te&#x27;aats&quot; (plank-built boats). Their food and material culture was based on an Indigenous worldview that positioned humans as one strand in a web of life (as expressed in their creation stories). Over time, different communities came to speak distinct dialects of the Tongva language, part of the Takic subgroup of the Uto-Aztecan language family. There may have been five or more such languages (three on the southernmost Channel Islands and at least two on the mainland).

European contact was first made in 1542 by Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who was greeted at Santa Catalina by people in a canoe. The following day, Cabrillo and his men entered a large bay on the mainland, which they named &quot;Baya de los Fumos&quot; (&quot;Bay of Smokes&quot;) because of the many smoke fires they saw there. The Indigenous people smoked their fish for preservation. This is commonly believed to be San Pedro Bay, near present-day San Pedro.

The Gaspar de Portolá land expedition in 1769 resulted in the founding of Mission San Gabriel by Catholic missionary Junipero Serra in 1771. Under the mission system, the Spanish initiated an era of forced relocation and virtual enslavement of the peoples to secure their labor. In addition, the Native Americans were exposed to the Old World diseases endemic among the colonists. As they lacked any acquired immunity, the Native Americans suffered epidemics with high mortality, leading to the rapid collapse of Tongva society and lifeways.

They retaliated by way of resistance and rebellions, including an unsuccessful rebellion in 1785 by Nicolás José and female chief Toypurina. In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain and secularized the missions. They sold the mission lands, known as ranchos, to elite ranchers and forced the Tongva to assimilate. Most became landless refugees during this time.

In 1848, California was ceded to the United States following the Mexican-American War. The US government signed 18 treaties between 1851 and 1852 promising of land for reservations. However, these treaties were never ratified by the Senate. The US had negotiated with people who did not represent the Tongva and had no authority to cede their land. During the following occupation by Americans, many of the Tongva and other Indigenous peoples were targeted with arrest. Unable to pay fines, they were used as convict laborers in a system of legalized slavery to expand the city of Los Angeles for Anglo-American settlers, who became the new majority in the area by 1880.

In the early 20th century, an extinction myth was purported about the Gabrieleño, who largely identified publicly as Mexican-American by this time. However, a close-knit community of the people remained in contact with one another between Tejon Pass and San Gabriel township into the 20th century. Since 2006, four organizations have claimed to represent the people: 
*the Gabrielino-Tongva Tribe, known as the &quot;hyphen&quot; group from the hyphen in their name; 
*the Gabrielino/Tongva Tribe, known as the &quot;slash&quot; group; 
*the Kizh Nation (Gabrieleño Band of Mission Indians); and 
*the Gabrieleño/Tongva Tribal Council.

Two of the groups, the hyphen and the slash group, were founded after a hostile split over the question of building an Indian casino. In 1994, the state of California recognized the Gabrielino &quot;as the aboriginal tribe of the Los Angeles Basin.&quot; No organized group representing the Tongva has attained recognition as a tribe by the federal government. The lack of federal recognition has prevented self-identified Tongva descendants from having control over Tongva ancestral remains, artifacts, and has left them without a land base in the Tongva traditional homeland.

In 2008, more than 1,700 people identified as Tongva or claimed partial ancestry. In 2013, it was reported that the four Tongva groups that have applied for federal recognition had more than 3,900 members in total.

The Tongva Taraxat Paxaavxa Conservancy was established to campaign for the rematriation of Tongva homelands. In 2022, a 1-acre site was returned to the conservancy in Altadena, which marked the first time the Tongva had land in Los Angeles County in 200 years.

== Geography ==

Tongva territories border those of numerous other tribes in the region. The historical Tongva lands made up what is now called &quot;the coastal region of Los Angeles County, the northwest portion of Orange County and off-lying islands.&quot; In 1962 Curator Bernice Johnson, of Southwest Museum, asserted that the northern boundary was somewhere between Topanga and Malibu (perhaps the vicinity of Malibu Creek) and the southern boundary was Orange County&#x27;s Aliso Creek.

== Names ==

===&quot;Tongva&quot;===

The word &quot;Tongva&quot; was coined by C. Hart Merriam in 1905 from numerous informants. These included Mrs. James Rosemyre (née Narcisa Higuera) (Gabrileño), who lived around Fort Tejon, near Bakersfield. Merriam&#x27;s orthography makes it clear that the endonym would be pronounced , .

Some descendants prefer the endonym &quot;Kizh&quot;, which they argue is an earlier and more historically accurate name that was well documented by records of the Smithsonian Institution, Congress, the Catholic Church, the San Gabriel Mission, and other historical scholars.

=== &quot;Gabrieleño&quot; ===
The Spanish referred to the Indigenous peoples surrounding Mission San Gabriel as the &quot;Gabrieleño&quot;. This was not their autonym, or their name for themselves. Because of historical uses, the term is part of every official tribe&#x27;s name in this area, spelled either as &quot;Gabrieleño&quot; or &quot;Gabrielino.&quot;

Because tribal groups have disagreed about appropriate use of the term &quot;Tongva&quot;, they have adopted &quot;Gabrieleño&quot; as a mediating term. For example, when Debra Martin, a city council member from Pomona, led a project in 2017 to dedicate wooden statues in local Ganesha Park to the Indigenous people of the area, they disagreed over which name, &quot;Tongva&quot; or &quot;Kizh&quot;, should be used on the dedication plaque. Tribal officials tentatively agreed to use the term &quot;Gabrieleño.&quot;

The Act of September 21, 1968, introduced this concept of the affiliation of an applicant&#x27;s ancestors in order to exclude certain individuals from receiving a share of the award to the “Indians of California” who chose to receive a share of any awards to certain tribes in California that had splintered off from the generic group. The members or ancestors of the petitioning group were not affected by the exclusion in the Act. Individuals with lineal or collateral descent from an Indian tribe who resided in California in 1852, would, if not excluded by the provisions of the Act of 1968, remain on the list of the “Indians of California.” To comply with the Act, the Secretary of Interior would have to collect information about the group affiliation of an applicant&#x27;s Indian ancestors. That information would be used to identify applicants who could share in another award. The group affiliation of an applicant&#x27;s ancestors was thus a basis for exclusion from, but not a requirement for inclusion on, the judgment roll. The act of 1968 stated that the Secretary of the Interior would distribute an equal share of the award to the individuals on the judgment roll “regardless of group affiliation.”

== History ==

=== Before the mission period ===

Many lines of evidence suggest that the Tongva are descended from Uto-Aztecan-speaking peoples who originated in what is now Nevada, and moved southwest into coastal Southern California 3,500 years ago. According to a model proposed by archaeologist Mark Q. Sutton, these migrants either absorbed or pushed out the earlier Hokan-speaking inhabitants. By 500 AD, one source estimates the Tongva may have come to occupy all the lands now associated with them, although this is unclear and contested among scholars.

In 1811, the priests of Mission San Gabriel recorded at least four languages; Kokomcar, Guiguitamcar, Corbonamga, and Sibanga. During the same time, three languages were recorded in Mission San Fernando.

Prior to Russian and Spanish colonization in what is now referred to California, the Tongva were primarily identified by their associated villages (Topanga, Cahuenga, Tujunga, Cucamonga, etc.) For example, individuals from Yaanga were known as &quot;Yaangavit&quot; among the people (in mission records, they were recorded as &quot;Yabit&quot;). The Tongva lived in as many as one hundred villages. One or two clans would usually constitute a village, which was the center of Tongva life.

The Tongva spoke a language of the Uto-Aztecan family (the remote ancestors of the Tongva probably coalesced as a people in the Sonoran Desert, between perhaps 3,000 and 5,000 years ago). The diversity within the Takic group is &quot;moderately deep&quot;; rough estimates by comparative linguists place the breakup of common Takic into the Luiseño-Juaneño on one hand, and the Tongva-Serrano on the other, at about 2,000 years ago. (This is comparable to the differentiation of the Romance languages of Europe). The division of the Tongva/Serrano group into the separate Tongva and Serrano peoples is more recent, and may have been influenced by Spanish missionary activity.

The majority of Tongva territory was located in what has been referred to as the Sonoran life zone, with rich ecological resources of acorn, pine nut, small game, and deer. On the coast, shellfish, sea mammals, and fish were available. Prior to Christianization, the prevailing Tongva worldview was that humans were not the apex of creation, but were rather one strand in the web of life. Humans, along with plants, animals, and the land were in a reciprocal relationship of mutual respect and care, which is evident in their creation stories. The Tongva understand time as nonlinear and there is constant communication with ancestors.

On October 7, 1542, an exploratory expedition led by Spanish explorer Juan Cabrillo reached Santa Catalina in the Channel Islands, where his ships were greeted by Tongva in a canoe. The following day, Cabrillo and his men, the first Europeans known to have interacted with the Gabrieleño people, entered a large bay on the mainland, which they named &quot;Baya de los Fumos&quot; (&quot;Bay of Smokes&quot;) on account of the many smoke fires they saw there. This is commonly believed to be San Pedro Bay, near present-day San Pedro.

=== Colonization and the mission period (1769–1834) ===
The Gaspar de Portola expedition in 1769 was the first contact by land to reach Tongva territory, marking the beginning of Spanish colonization. Franciscan padre Junipero Serra accompanied Portola. Within two years of the expedition, Serra had founded four missions, including Mission San Gabriel, founded in 1771 and rebuilt in 1774, and Mission San Fernando, founded in 1797. The people enslaved at San Gabriel were referred to as &quot;Gabrieleños&quot;, while those enslaved at San Fernando were referred to as &quot;Fernandeños&quot;. Although their language idioms were distinguishable, they did not diverge greatly, and it is possible there were as many as half a dozen dialects rather than the two which the existence of the missions has lent the appearance of being standard. The demarcation of the Fernandeño and the Gabrieleño territories is mostly conjectural and there is no known point in which the two groups differed markedly in customs. The wider Gabrieleño group occupied what is now Los Angeles County south of the Sierra Madre and half of Orange County, as well as the islands of Santa Catalina and San Clemente.

The Spanish oversaw the construction of Mission San Gabriel in 1771. The Spanish colonizers used slave labor from local villages to construct the Missions. Following the destruction of the original mission, probably due to El Niño flooding, the Spanish ordered the mission relocated five miles north in 1774 and began referring to the Tongva as &quot;Gabrieleno.&quot; At the Gabrieleño settlement of Yaanga along the Los Angeles River, missionaries and Indian neophytes, or baptized converts, built the first town of Los Angeles in 1781. It was called &quot;El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula&quot; (The Village of Our Lady, the Queen of the Angels of Porziuncola). In 1784, a sister mission, the &quot;Nuestra Señora Reina de los Angeles Asistencia&quot;, was founded at Yaanga as well.
Entire villages were baptized and indoctrinated into the mission system with devastating results. For example, from 1788 to 1815, natives of the village of Guaspet were baptized at San Gabriel. Proximity to the missions created mass tension for Native Californians, which initiated &quot;forced transformations in all aspects of daily life, including manners of speaking, eating, working, and connecting with the supernatural.&quot; As stated by scholars John Dietler, Heather Gibson, and Benjamin Vargas, &quot;Catholic enterprises of proselytization, acceptance into a mission as a convert, in theory, required abandoning most, if not all, traditional lifeways.&quot; Various strategies of control were implemented to retain control, such as the use of violence, segregation by age and gender, and using new converts as instruments of control over others. For example, Mission San Gabriel&#x27;s Father Zalvidea punished suspected shamans &quot;with frequent flogging and by chaining traditional religious practitioners together in pairs and sentencing them to hard labor in the sawmill.&quot; A missionary during this period reported that three out of four children died at Mission San Gabriel before reaching the age of 2. Nearly 6,000 Tongva lie buried in the grounds of the San Gabriel Mission. Carey McWilliams characterized it as follows: &quot;the Franciscan padres eliminated Indians with the effectiveness of Nazis operating concentration camps...&quot;

There is much evidence of Tongva&#x27;s resistance to the mission system. Many individuals returned to their village at the time of death. Many converts retained their traditional practices in both domestic and spiritual contexts, despite the attempts by the padres and missionaries to control them. Traditional foods were incorporated into the mission diet and lithic and shell bead production and use persisted. More overt strategies of resistance such as refusal to enter the system, work slowdowns, abortion and infanticide of children resulting from rape, and fugiti were also prevalent. Five major uprisings were recorded at Mission San Gabriel alone. Two late-eighteenth-century rebellions against the mission system were led by Nicolás José, who was an early convert who had two social identities: &quot;publicly participating in Catholic sacraments at the mission but privately committed to traditional dances, celebrations, and rituals.&quot; He participated in a failed attempt to kill the mission&#x27;s priests in 1779 and organized eight foothill villages in a revolt in October 1785 with Toypurina, who further organized the villages, which &quot;demonstrated a previously undocumented level of regional political unification both within and well beyond the mission.&quot; However, divided loyalties among the natives contributed to the failure of the 1785 attempt as well as mission soldiers being alerted of the attempt by converts or neophytes.
Toypurina, José and two other leaders of the rebellion, Chief Tomasajaquichi of Juvit village and a man named Alijivit, from the nearby village of Jajamovit, were put on trial for the 1785 rebellion. At his trial, José stated that he participated because the ban at the mission on dances and ceremonies instituted by the missionaries, and enforced by the governor of California in 1782, was intolerable as they prevented their mourning ceremonies. When questioned about the attack, Toypurina is famously quoted as saying that she participated in the instigation because “[she hated] the padres and all of you, for living here on my native soil, for trespassing upon the land of my forefathers and despoiling our tribal domains. … I came [to the mission] to inspire the dirty cowards to fight, and not to quail at the sight of Spanish sticks that spit fire and death, nor [to] retch at the evil smell of gunsmokeand be done with you white invaders!’ Scholars have debated the accuracy of this quote, from Thomas Workman Temple II&#x27;s article “Toypurina the Witch and the Indian Uprising at San Gabriel” suggesting it may differ significantly from the testimony recorded by Spanish authorities at the time. According to the soldier who recorded her words, she stated simply that she ‘‘was angry with the Padres and the others of the Mission, because they had come to live and establish themselves in her land.’’ In June 1788, nearly three years later, their sentences arrived from Mexico City: Nicolás José was banned from San Gabriel and sentenced to six years of hard labor in irons at the most distant penitentiary in the region. Toypurina was banished from Mission San Gabriel and sent to the most distant Spanish mission.

Resistance to Spanish rule demonstrated how the Spanish Crown&#x27;s claims to California were both insecure and contested. By the 1800s, San Gabriel was the richest in the entire colonial mission system, supplying cattle, sheep, goats, hogs, horses, mules, and other supplies for settlers and settlements throughout Alta California.

The mission system has been described by some historians as a form of coerced labor that deeply disrupted Indigenous lifeways and autonomy. Latter-day ethnologist Hugo Reid reported, “Indian children were taken from their parents to be raised behind bars at the mission. They were allowed outside the locked dormitories only to attend to church business and their assigned chores. When they were old enough, boys and girls were put to work in the vast vineyards and orchards owned by the missions. Soldiers watched, ready to hunt down any who tried to escape.” Writing in 1852, Reid said he knew of Tongva who “had an ear lopped off or were branded on the lip for trying to get away.”

In 1810, the &quot;Gabrieleño&quot; labor population at the mission was recorded to be 1,201. It jumped to 1,636 in 1820 and then declined to 1,320 in 1830. Resistance to this system of forced labor continued into the early 19th century. In 1817, the San Gabriel Mission recorded that there were &quot;473 Indian fugitives.&quot; In 1828, a German immigrant purchased the land on which the village of Yang-Na stood and evicted the entire community with the help of Mexican officials.

=== Mexican secularization and occupation (1834–1848) ===
The mission period ended in 1834 with secularization under Mexican rule. Some &quot;Gabrieleño&quot; were absorbed into Mexican society as a result of secularization, which emancipated the neophytes. Tongva and other California Natives largely became workers while former Spanish elites were granted huge land grants. Land was systemically denied to California Natives by &quot;Californio&quot; land-owning men. In the Los Angeles basin area, only 20 former neophytes from San Gabriel Mission received any land from secularization. What they received were relatively small plots of land. A &quot;Gabrieleño&quot; by the name of Prospero Elias Dominguez was granted a 22-acre plot near the mission while Mexican authorities granted the remainder of the mission land, approximately 1.5 million acres, to a few colonist families. In 1846, it was noted by researcher Kelly Lytle Hernández that 140 Gabrieleños signed a petition demanding access to mission lands and that &quot;Californio&quot; authorities rejected their petition.

Emancipated from enslavement in the missions yet barred from their own land, most Tongva became landless refugees during this period. Entire villages fled inland to escape the invaders and continued devastation. Others moved to Los Angeles, a city which saw an increase in the Native population from 200 in 1820 to 553 in 1836 (out of a total population of 1,088). As stated by scholar Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, &quot;while they should have been owners, the Tongva became workers, performing strenuous, back-breaking labor just as they had done ever since settler colonialism emerged in Southern California.&quot; As described by researcher Heather Valdez Singleton, Los Angeles was heavily dependent on Native labor and &quot;grew slowly on the back of the Gabrieleño laborers.&quot; Some of the people became &quot;vaqueros&quot; on the ranches, highly skilled horsemen or cowboys, herding and caring for the cattle. There was little land available to the Tongva to use for food outside of the ranches. Some crops such as corn and beans were planted on ranchos to sustain the workers.

Several Gabrieleño families stayed within the San Gabriel township, which became &quot;the cultural and geographic center of the Gabrieleño community.&quot; Yaanga also diversified and increased in size, with peoples of various Native backgrounds coming to live together shortly following secularization. However, the government had instituted a system dependent on Native labor and servitude and increasingly eliminated any alternatives within the Los Angeles area. As explained by Kelly Lytle Hernández, &quot;there was no place for Natives living but not working in Mexican Los Angeles. In turn, the &quot;ayuntaminto&quot; (city council) passed new laws to compel Natives to work or be arrested.&quot; In January 1836, the council directed &quot;Californios&quot; to sweep across Los Angeles to arrest &quot;all drunken Indians.&quot; As recorded by Hernández, &quot;Tongva men and women, along with an increasingly diverse set of their Native neighbors, filled the jail and convict labor crews in Mexican Los Angeles.&quot; By 1844, most Natives in Los Angeles worked as servants in a perpetual system of servitude, tending to the land and serving settlers, invaders, and colonizers.

The &quot;ayuntamiunto&quot; forced the Native settlement of Yaanga to move farther away from town. By the mid-1840s, the settlement was forcibly moved eastward across the Los Angeles River, placing a divide between Mexican Los Angeles and the nearest Native community. However, &quot;Native men, women, and children continued to live (not just work) in the city. On Saturday Nights, they even held parties, danced, and gambled at the removed Yaanga village and also at the plaza at the center of town.&quot; In response, the &quot;Californios&quot; continued to attempt to control Native lives, issuing Alta California governor Pio Pico a petition in 1846 stating: &quot;We ask that the Indians be placed under strict police surveillance or the persons for whom the Indians work give [the Indians] quarter at the employer&#x27;s rancho.&quot; In 1847, a law was passed that prohibited Gabrielenos from entering the city without proof of employment. A part of the proclamation read:Indians who have no masters but are self-sustaining, shall be lodged outside of the City limits in localities widely separated... All vagrant Indians of either sex who have not tried to secure a situation within four days and are found unemployed, shall be put to work on public works or sent to the house of correction.In 1848, Los Angeles formally became a town in the United States following the Mexican-American War.

=== American occupation and continued subjugation (1848–) ===
Landless and unrecognized, the people faced systemic discrimination, exploitation through convict labor, and loss of autonomy under American occupation. Some of the people were displaced to small Mexican and Native communities in the Eagle Rock and Highland Park districts of Los Angeles as well as Pauma, Pala, Temecula, Pechanga, and San Jacinto. The imprisonment of Natives in Los Angeles was a symbol of establishing the new &quot;rule of law.&quot; The city&#x27;s vigilante community would routinely &quot;invade&quot; the jail and hang the accused in the streets. Once Congress granted statehood to California in 1850, many of the first laws passed targeted Natives for arrest, imprisonment, and convict labor. The 1850 Act for the Government and Protection of Indians &quot;targeted Native peoples for easy arrest by stipulating that they could be arrested on vagrancy charges based &#x27;on the complaint of any reasonable citizen&#x27;&quot; and Gabrieleños faced the brunt of this policy. Section 14 of the act stated:When an Indian is convicted of any offence before a Justice of the Peace punishable by fine, any white person may, by consent of the Justice, give bond for said Indian, conditioned for the payment of said fine and costs, and in such case the Indian shall be compelled to work for the person so bailing, until he has discharged or cancelled the fine assessed against him.Native men were disproportionately criminalized and swept into this legalized system of indentured servitude. As was recorded by Anglo-American settlers, &quot;&#x27;White men, whom the Marshal is too discreet to arrest&#x27; ... spilled out of the town&#x27;s many saloons, streets, and brothels, but the aggressive and targeted enforcement of state and local vagrancy and drunk codes filled the Los Angeles County Jail with Natives, most of whom were men.&quot; Most spent their days working on the county chain gang, which was largely involved with keeping the city streets clean in the 1850s and 1860s but increasingly included road construction projects as well.

Although federal officials reported that there were an estimated 16,930 California Indians and 1,050 at Mission San Gabriel, &quot;the federal agents ignored them and those living in Los Angeles&quot; because they were viewed as &quot;friendly to the whites,&quot; as revealed in the personal diaries of Commissioner George W. Barbour. In 1852, superintendent of Indian Affairs Edward Fitzgerald Beale echoed this sentiment, reporting that &quot;because these Indians were Christians, with many holding ranch jobs and having interacted with whites,&quot; that &quot;they are not much to be dreaded.&quot; Although a California Senate Bill of 2008 asserted that the US government signed treaties with the Gabrieleño, promising of land for reservations, and that these treaties were never ratified, a paper published in 1972 by Robert Heizer of the University of California at Berkeley, shows that the eighteen treaties made between April 29, 1851, and August 22, 1852, were negotiated with persons who did not represent the Tongva people and that none of these persons had authority to cede lands that belonged to the people.

An 1852 editorial in the &quot;Los Angeles Star&quot; revealed the public&#x27;s anger towards any possibility of the Gabrieleño receiving recognition and exercising sovereignty:To place upon our most fertile soil the most degraded race of aborigines upon the North American Continent, to invest them with the rights of sovereignty, and to teach them that they are to be treated as powerful and independent nations, is planting the seeds of future disaster and ruin... We hope that the general government will let us alonethat it will neither undertake to feed, settle or remove the Indians amongst whom we in the South reside, and that they leave everything just as it now exists, except affording us the protection which two or three cavalry companies would give.In 1852, Hugo Reid wrote a series of letters for the &quot;Los Angeles Star&quot; from the center of the Gabrieleño community in San Gabriel township, describing Gabrieleño life and culture. Reid himself was married to a Gabrieleño woman by the name of Bartolomea Cumicrabit, who he renamed &quot;Victoria.&quot; Reid wrote the following: &quot;Their chiefs still exist. In San Gabriel remain only four, and those young... They have no jurisdiction more than to appoint times for holding of Feasts and regulating affairs connected with the church [traditional structure made of brush].&quot; There is some speculation that Reid was campaigning for the position of Indian agent in Southern California, but died before he could be appointed. Instead, in 1852, Benjamin D. Wilson was appointed, who maintained the status quo. The letters of Hugo Reid revealed the names of 28 Gabrielino villages.

In 1855, the Gabrieleño were reported by the superintendent of Indian affairs Thomas J. Henley to be in &quot;a miserable and degraded condition.&quot; However, Henley admitted that moving them to a reservation, potentially at Sebastian Reserve in Tejon Pass, would be opposed by the citizens because &quot;in the vineyards, especially during the grape season, their labor is made useful and is obtained at a cheap rate.&quot; A few Gabrieleño were in fact at Sebastian Reserve and maintained contact with the people living in San Gabriel during this time.

In 1859, amidst increasing criminalization and absorption into the city&#x27;s burgeoning convict labor system, the county grand jury declared &quot;stringent vagrant laws should be enacted and enforced compelling such persons [&#x27;Indians&#x27;] to obtain an honest livelihood or seek their old homes in the mountains.&quot; This declaration ignored Reid&#x27;s research, which stated that most Tongva villages, including Yaanga, &quot;were located in the basin, along its rivers and on its shoreline, stretching from the deserts and to the sea.&quot; Only a few villages led by &quot;tomyaars&quot; (chiefs) were &quot;in the mountains, where Chengiichngech&#x27;s avengers, serpents, and bears lived,&quot; as described by historian Kelly Lytle Hernández. However, &quot;the grand jury dismissed the depths of Indigenous claims to life, land, and sovereignty in the region and, instead, chose to frame Indigenous peoples as drunks and vagrants loitering in Los Angeles... disavowing a long history of Indigenous belonging in the basin.&quot;

While in 1848, Los Angeles had been a small town largely of Mexicans and Natives, by 1880 it was home to an Anglo-American majority following waves of white migration in the 1870s from the completion of the transcontinental railroad. As stated by research Heather Valdez Singleton, newcomers &quot;took advantage of the fact that many Gabrieleño families, who had cultivated and lived on the same land for generations, did not hold legal title to the land, and used the law to evict Indian families.&quot; The Gabrieleño became vocal about this and notified former Indian agent J. Q. Stanley, who referred to them as &quot;half-civilized&quot; yet lobbied to protect the Gabrieleño &quot;against the lawless whites living amongst them,&quot; arguing that they would become &quot;vagabonds&quot; otherwise. However, active Indian agent Augustus P. Greene&#x27;s recommendation took precedent, arguing that &quot;Mission Indians in southern California were slowing the settlement of this portion of the country for non-Indians and suggested that the Indians be completely assimilated,&quot; as summarized by Singleton.

In 1882, Helen Hunt Jackson was sent by the federal government to document the condition of the Mission Indians in southern California. She reported that there were a considerable number of people &quot;in the colonies in the San Gabriel Valley, where they live like gypsies in brush huts, here today, gone tomorrow, eking out a miserable existence by days&#x27; work.&quot; However, even though Jackson&#x27;s report would become the impetus for the Mission Indian Relief Act of 1891, the Gabrieleño were &quot;overlooked by the commission charged with setting aside lands for Mission Indians.&quot; It is speculated that this may have been attributed to what was perceived as their compliance with the government, which caused them to be neglected, as noted earlier by Indian agent J. Q. Stanley.

==== Extinction controversy ====

By the early twentieth century, Gabrieleño identity had suffered greatly under American occupation. Most Gabrieleño publicly identified as Mexican, learned Spanish, and adopted Catholicism while keeping their identity a secret. In schools, students were punished for mentioning that they were &quot;Indian&quot; and many of the people assimilated into Mexican-American or Chicano culture. Further attempts to establish a reservation for the Gabrieleño in 1907 failed. Soon it began to be perpetuated in the local press that the Gabrieleño were extinct. In February 1921, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared that the death of Jose de los Santos Juncos, an Indigenous man who lived at Mission San Gabriel and was 106 years old at his time of passing, &quot;marked the passing of a vanished race.&quot; In 1925, Alfred Kroeber declared that the Gabrieleño culture was extinct, stating &quot;they have melted away so completely that we know more of the finer facts of the culture of ruder tribes.&quot; Scholars have noted that this extinction myth has proven to be &quot;remarkably resilient,&quot; yet is untrue.

Despite being declared extinct, Gabrieleño children were still being assimilated by federal agents who encouraged enrollment at Sherman Indian School in Riverside, California. Between 1890 and 1920, at least 50 Gabrieleño children were recorded at the school. Between 1910 and 1920, the establishment of the Mission Indian Federation, of which the Gabrieleño joined, led to the 1928 California Indians Jurisdictional Act, which created official enrollment records for those who could prove ancestry from a California Indian living in the state in 1852. Over 150 people self-identified as Gabrieleño on this roll. A Gabrieleño woman at Tejon Reservation provided the names and addresses of several Gabrieleño living in San Gabriel, showing that contact between the group at Tejon Reservation and the group at San Gabriel township, which are more than 70 miles apart, was being maintained into the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1971, Bernice Johnston, former curator of the Southwest Museum and author of &quot;California’s Gabrieleno Indians&quot; (1962), spoke to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: “After spending much of her life trying to trace the Indians, she believes she almost came in contact with some Gabrielenos a few years ago…She relates that on a Sunday, while giving a tour of the museum, ‘I saw these shy, dark people looking around. They were asking questions about the Gabrieleno Indians. I asked why they wanted to know, and nearly fell over when they told me they were Gabrielenos and wanted to know something about themselves. I was busy with the tour, we were crowded. I rushed back to them as soon as I could but they were gone. I didn’t even get their names.”

==== Desecrated sites and Land Back ====

Historians and contemporary Tongva advocates have argued that Anglo-American institutions, including schools and museums, have historically challenged the preservation of tribal identity throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Contemporary members have cited being denied the legitimacy of their identity. Tribal identity is also hindered by a lack of federal recognition and having no land base, which has meant that the tribe has access to almost none of their traditional homelands.

The Tongva have also struggled to protect their sacred sites, ancestral remains, and artefacts from destruction in the 21st century. In 2001, a 9,000-year-old Bolsa Chica village site was heavily damaged. The company that performed the initial archaeological survey was fined $600,000 for its poor assessment that clearly favored the developer. Burials near the site of Genga were unearthed and moved, despite opposition from the tribes, in favor of commercial development.

In 2019, CSU, Long Beach dumped trash and dirt on top of Puvunga in its construction of new student housing, which reawakened a decades-long dispute between the university and the tribe over the treatment of the sacred site. In 2022, it was announced that part of the village site of Genga may be transformed into a green space. Leaders of the project have claimed that &quot;tribal descendants of the area’s earliest residents will also have a voice&quot; in how the park is developed.

The Tongva Taraxat Paxaavxa Conservancy has been established as part of the Land Back movement and for the rematriation of Tongva homelands. The &quot;kuuyam nahwá’a&quot; (&quot;guest exchange&quot;) has been developed by the conservancy as a way for people living in the homelands of the Tongva to pay a form of contribution for living on the land. In October 2022, a 1-acre site was returned to the conservancy by a private resident in Altadena, which marked the first time the Tongva had land in Los Angeles County in 200 years.

== Culture ==
The Tongva lived in the main part of the most fertile lowland of southern California, including a stretch of sheltered coast with a pleasant climate and abundant food resources, as well as Santa Catalina, San Clemente, and San Nicolas Islands. The Tongva were a prominent cultural group south of the Tehachapi and among the Uto-Aztecan speakers in California, influencing other Indigenous groups through trade and interaction. Many of the cultural developments of the surrounding southern peoples had their origin with the Gabrieleño. The Tongva territory was the center of a flourishing trade network that extended from the Channel Islands in the west to the Colorado River in the east, allowing the people to maintain trade relations with the Cahuilla, Serrano, Luiseño, Chumash, and Mohave.

Like all Indigenous peoples, they utilized and existed in an interconnected relationship with the flora and fauna of their familial territory. Villages were located throughout four major ecological zones, as noted by biologist Matthew Teutimez: interior mountains and foothills, grassland/oak woodland, sheltered coastal canyons, and the exposed coast. Therefore, resources such as plants, animals, and earth minerals were diverse and used for various purposes, including for food and materials. Prominent flora included oak (&quot;Quercus agrifolia&quot;) and willow (&quot;Salix spp.&quot;) trees, chia (&quot;Salvia columbariae&quot;), cattail (&quot;Typha spp.&quot;), datura or jimsonweed (&quot;Datura innoxia&quot;), white sage (&quot;Salvia apiana&quot;), &quot;Juncus spp.&quot;, Mexican Elderberry (&quot;Sambucus&quot;), wild tobacco (&quot;Nicotiana spp.&quot;), and yucca (&quot;Hesperoyucca whipplei&quot;). Prominent fauna included mule deer, pronghorn, black bear, grizzly bear, black-tailed jackrabbit, cottontail, bald eagle, red-tailed hawk, dolphin, and gray whale.

=== &quot;Te&#x27;aat&quot; and the ocean ===
The Tongva had a concentrated population along the coast. They fished and hunted in the estuary of the Los Angeles River, and like the Chumash, their neighbors to the north and west along the Pacific coast, the Gabrieleño built seaworthy plank canoes, called &quot;te&#x27;aat&quot;, from driftwood. To build them, they used planks of driftwood pine that were sewn together with vegetable fiber cord, edge to edge, and then glued with the tar that was available either from the La Brea Tar Pits, or as asphalt that had washed up on shore from offshore oil seeps. The finished vessel was caulked with plant fibers and tar, stained with red ochre, and sealed with pine pitch. The &quot;te&#x27;aat&quot;, as noted by the Sebastián Vizcaíno expedition, could hold up to 20 people as well as their gear and trade goods. These canoes allowed the development of trade between the mainland villages and the offshore islands, and were important to the region&#x27;s economy and social organization, with trade in food and manufactured goods being carried on between the people on the mainland coast and people in the interior as well. The Gabrieleño regularly paddled their canoes to Catalina Island, where they gathered abalone, which they pried off the rocks with implements made of fragments of whale ribs or other strong bones.

=== Food culture ===

In the Tongva economic system, food resources were managed by the village chief, who was given a portion of the yield of each day&#x27;s hunting, fishing, or gathering to add to the communal food reserves. Individual families stored some food to be used in times of scarcity. Villages were located in places with accessible drinking water, protection from the elements, and productive areas where different ecological niches on the land intersected. Situating their villages at these resource islands enabled the Tongva to gather the plant products of two or more zones in close proximity.

Households consisted of a main house (&quot;kiiy&quot;) and temporary camp shelters used during food-gathering excursions. In the summer, families who lived near grasslands collected roots, seeds, flowers, fruit, and leafy greens, and in the winter families who lived near chaparral shrubland collected nuts and acorns, yucca, and hunted deer. The group used “wooden tongs” to collect prickly pear fruits.

Some prairie communities moved to the coast in the winter to fish, hunt whales and elephant seals, and harvest shellfish. Those villages located on the coast during the summer went on food collecting trips inland during the winter rainy season to gather roots, tubers, corms, and bulbs of plants including cattails, lilies, and wild onions.

The Tongva did not practice horticulture or agriculture, as their well-developed hunter-gatherer and trade economy provided adequate food resources. The bread was made from the yellow pollen of cattail heads, and the underground rhizomes were dried and ground into a starchy meal. The young shoots were eaten raw. The seeds of chia, a herbaceous plant of the sage family, were gathered in large quantities when they were ripe. The flower heads were beaten with a paddle over a tightly woven basket to collect the seeds. These were dried or roasted and ground into a flour called &quot;pinole,&quot; which was often mixed with the flour of other ground seeds or grains. Water was added to make a cooling drink; mixing with less water yielded a kind of porridge that could be baked into cakes.

Acorn mush was a staple food as it was of all the Indigenous peoples who were forcibly relocated to missions in Southern California. Acorns were gathered in October; this was a communal effort with the men climbing the trees and shaking them while the women and children collected the nuts. The acorns were stored in large wicker granaries supported by wooden stakes well above the ground. Preparing them for food took about a week. Acorns were placed, one at a time, on end in the slight hollow of a rock and their shells broken by a light blow from a small hammerstone; then the membrane, or skin, covering the acorn meat was removed. Following this process the acorn meats were dried for days, after which the kernels were pounded into a meal with a pestle. This was done in a stone mortar or in a mortar hole in a boulder. Large bedrock outcroppings near oak stands often display evidence of the community mills where the women labored.

The pounded acorn meal was put into baskets and the bitter tannic acid it contained was leached out to make the meal more palatable and digestible. The prepared meal was cooked by boiling in water in a watertight grass-woven basket or in a soapstone bowl into which heated stones were dropped. Soapstone casseroles were used directly over the fire. Various foods of meat, seeds, or roots were cooked by the same method. The mush thus prepared was eaten cold or nearly so, as was all their food. Another favored Tongva food was the seed kernel of a species of plum (&quot;prunus ilicifolia&quot; (common name: holly-leaf cherry) they called &quot;islay&quot;, which was ground into meal and made into gruel.

Men performed most of the heavy, short-duration labor; they hunted, fished, helped with some food-gathering, and carried on trade with other cultural groups. Large game animals were hunted with bows and arrows, and small game was taken with deadfall traps, snares, and bows made of buckeye wood. John P. Harrington recorded that rattlesnake venom was used as an arrow poison. Burrowing animals were driven from their burrows with smoke and clubbed; communal rabbit drives were made during the seasonal controlled burning of chaparral on the prairie, the rabbits being killed with nets, bow and arrows, and throwing sticks.

Harpoons, spear-throwers, and clubs were used to hunt marine mammals and &quot;te&#x27;aat&quot; used to access them. Fishing was done from shorelines or along rivers, streams, and creeks with hook and line, nets, basketry traps, spears, bow and arrows, and poisons made from plants. Reciprocity and sharing of resources were important values in Tongva culture. Hugo Reid reported that the hoarding of food supplies was so stigmatized by the Tongva moral code that hunters would give away large portions of coveted foods such as fresh meat, and under some circumstances, were prohibited from eating their own kill or fishermen from eating their own catch.

Women collected and prepared plant and some animal food resources and made baskets, pots, and clothing. In their old age, they and the old men cared for the young and taught them Tongva lifeways.

=== Material culture ===

Tongva material culture and technology reflected a sophisticated knowledge of the working properties of natural materials and a highly developed artisanship, shown in many articles of everyday utility decorated with shell inlay, carving, and painting. Most of these items, including baskets, shell tools, and wooden weapons, were extremely perishable. Soapstone from quarries on Catalina Island was used to make cooking implements, animal carvings, pipes, ritual objects, and ornaments.

Using the stems of rushes (&quot;Juncus&quot; sp .), grass (&quot;Muhlenbergia rigens&quot;), and squawbush (&quot;Rhus trilobata&quot;), women fabricated coiled and twined basketry in a three-color pattern for household use, seed collecting, and ceremonial containers to hold grave offerings. They sealed some baskets, such as water bottles, with asphalt to make watertight containers for holding liquids.

The Tongva used the leaves of tule reeds as well as those of cattails to weave mats and thatch their shelters.

Living in the mild climate of southern California, the men and children usually went nude, and women wore only a two-piece skirt, the back part being made from the flexible inner bark of cottonwood or willow, or occasionally deerskin. The front apron was made of cords of twisted dogbane or milkweed. People went barefoot except in rough areas where they wore crude sandals made of yucca fiber. In cold weather, they wore robes or capes made from twisted strips of rabbit fur, deer skins, or bird skins with the feathers still attached. Also used as blankets at night, these were made of sea otter skins along the coast and on the islands. “Women were tattooed from cheek to shoulder blade, from elbow to shoulder,” with cactus thorns used as needles and charcoal dust rubbed into the wounds as “ink,” leaving a blue-gray mark under the skin after the wounds healed.

=== Social culture ===
There were three capital crimes in the community: murder, incest and disrespect for elders.

According to Father Gerónimo Boscana, relations between the Chumash, Gabrieleños, Luiseños, and Diegueños, as he called them, were generally peaceful but “when there was a war it was ferocious…no quarter was given, and no prisoners were taken except the wounded.”

== Contemporary tribe ==
The earliest ethnological surveys of the Christianized population of the San Gabriel area, who were then known by the Spanish as &quot;Gabrielino&quot;, were conducted in the mid-19th century. By this time, their pre-Christian religious beliefs and mythology were already fading. The Gabrieleño language was on the brink of extinction by 1900, so only fragmentary records of the Indigenous language and culture of the Gabrieleño have been preserved. Gabrieleño was one of the Cupan languages in the Takic language group, which is part of the Uto-Aztecan family of languages. It may be considered a dialect of Fernandeño, but it has not been a language of everyday conversation since the 1940s. The Gabrieleño people now speak English but a few are attempting to revive their language by using it in everyday conversation and ceremonial contexts. Presently, Gabrieleño is also being used in language revitalization classes and in some public discussions regarding religious and environmental issues.

The library of Loyola Marymount University, located in Los Angeles (Westchester), has an extensive collection of archival materials related to the Tongva and their history.

In the 21st century, an estimated 1,700 people self-identify as members of the Tongva or Gabrieleño tribe. In 1994, the state of California recognized the &quot;Gabrielino-Tongva Tribe&quot; () and the &quot;Fernandino-Tongva Tribe&quot; (), but neither has gained federal recognition. In 2013, it was reported that the four Tongva groups that have applied for federal recognition had over 3,900 members collectively.

The Gabrieleño/Tongva people do not accept one organization or government as representing them. They have had strong internal disagreements about governance and their future, largely related to plans supported by some members to open a gaming casino on land that would be considered part of the Gabrieleño/Tongva&#x27;s homeland. Gaming casinos have generated great revenues for many Native American tribes, but not all Tongva people believe the benefits outweigh the negative aspects. The Gabrielino/Tongva Tribe (sometimes called the &quot;slash&quot; group) and Gabrielino-Tongva Tribe (sometimes called the &quot;hyphen&quot; group) are the two primary factions advocating a casino for the Tongva nation, with sharing of revenues by all the people. The Gabrielino Tribal Council of San Gabriel, now known as the Kizh Nation (Gabrieleño Band of Mission Indians), claims that it does not support gaming. The Gabrieleno Tongva San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians also does not support gambling and has been operating and meeting in the city of San Gabriel for over a hundred years. None of these organizations is recognized as a tribe by the federal government.

=== History of organizations and casino dispute ===
In 1990, the Gabrielino/Tongva of San Gabriel filed for federal recognition. Other Gabrieleño groups have done the same. The Gabrielino/Tongva of California Tribal Council and the Coastal Gabrielino-Diegueno Band of Mission Indians filed federal petitions in 1997. These applications for federal recognition remain pending.

The San Gabriel group gained acknowledgement of its nonprofit status by the state of California in 1994. In 2001, the San Gabriel council divided over concessions given to the developers of Playa Vista and a proposal to build an Indian casino in Compton, California. A Santa Monica faction formed that advocated gaming for the tribe, which the San Gabriel faction opposed.

The San Gabriel council and Santa Monica faction sued each other over allegations that the San Gabriel faction expelled some members in order to increase gaming shares for other members. There were allegations that the Santa Monica faction stole tribal records in order to support its case for federal recognition.

In September 2006, the Santa Monica faction divided into the &quot;slash&quot; and &quot;hyphen&quot; groups: the Gabrielino/Tongva Tribe and Gabrielino-Tongva Tribe. Tribal secretary Sam Dunlap and tribal attorney Jonathan Stein confronted each other over various alleged fiscal improprieties and derogatory comments made to each other. Since that time, the slash group has hired former state senator Richard Polanco as its chief executive officer. The hyphen group has allied with Stein and issued warrants for the arrest of Polanco and members of the slash group.

Stein&#x27;s group (hyphen), the Gabrielino-Tongva Tribe, is based in Santa Monica. It has proposed a casino to be built in Garden Grove, California, approximately two miles south of Disneyland. In September 2007, the city council of Garden Grove unanimously rejected the casino proposal, instead choosing to build a water park on the land.

=== Land use issues ===
Controversies have arisen in contemporary California related to land-use issues and Native American rights, including those of the Tongva. Since the late twentieth century, both the state and the United States governments have improved respect of Indigenous rights and tribal sovereignty. The Tongva have challenged local development plans in the courts in order to protect and preserve some of their sacred grounds. Given the long Indigenous history in the area, not all archaeological sites have been identified.

Sometimes land developers have inadvertently disturbed Tongva burial grounds. The tribe denounced archaeologists breaking bones of ancestral remains found during an excavation of a site at Playa Vista.

In the 1990s, the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation revived use of the Tongva Sacred Springs, also known as Kuruvungna Springs, for sacred ceremonies. The natural springs are located on the site of a former Tongva village, now developed as the campus of University High School in West Los Angeles. The Tongva consider the springs to be one of their last remaining sacred sites and they regularly make them the centerpiece of ceremonial events.

The Tongva have another sacred area known as &quot;Puvungna.&quot; They believe it is the birthplace of the Tongva prophet Chingishnish, and many believe it to be the place of creation. The site contains an active spring and the area was formerly inhabited by a Tongva village. It has been developed as part of the grounds of California State University, Long Beach. A portion of Puvungna, a Tongva burial ground on the western edge of the campus, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In October 2019, following the dumping of soil, along with concrete, rebar and other debris, on &quot;land that holds archaeological artefacts actively used by local Tribal groups for ceremonies&quot; from a nearby construction site, the Juaneño Band of Mission Indians, Acjachemen Nation–Belardes (an organization that self-identifies as a Native American tribe), and the California Cultural Resource Preservation Alliance (CCRPA) filed a lawsuit against the university. In November 2019, the university agreed to stop dumping materials onto the site, and as of 2020 the lawsuit between these parties is still ongoing.

== Traditional narratives ==

Tongva/Gabrieleño/Fernandeño oral literature is relatively little known, due to their early Christianization in the 1770s by Spanish missions in California. The available evidence suggests strong cultural links with the group&#x27;s linguistic kin and neighbors to the south and east, the Luiseño and the Cahuilla.

According to Kroeber (1925), the pre-Christian Tongva had a &quot;mythic-ritual-social six-god pantheon&quot;. The principal deity was Chinigchinix, also known as Quaoar. Another important figure is Weywot, the god of the sky, who was created by Quaoar. Weywot ruled over the Tongva, but he was very cruel, and he was finally killed by his own sons. When the Tongva assembled to decide what to do next, they had a vision of a ghostly being who called himself Quaoar, who said he had come to restore order and to give laws to the people. After he had given instructions as to which groups would have political and spiritual leadership, he began to dance and slowly ascended into heaven.

After consulting with the Tongva, astronomers Michael E. Brown and Chad Trujillo used the name of Quaoar to name a large object in the Kuiper belt that they had discovered, 50000 Quaoar (2002). When Brown later found a satellite of Quaoar, he left the choice of name up to the Tongva, who selected Weywot (2009).

== Toponymy ==
From the Spanish colonial period, Tongva place names have been absorbed into general use in Southern California. Examples include Pacoima, Tujunga, Topanga, Rancho Cucamonga, Azusa (Azucsagna), and Cahuenga Pass.

Sacred sites that have not been totally demolished, destroyed, or built over include Puvunga, Kuruvungna Springs, and Eagle Rock.

In other cases, toponyms or places have been recently named to honor the Indigenous peoples. The Gabrielino Trail is a path through the Angeles National Forest, created and named in 1970.

A summit in the Verdugo Mountains, in Glendale, was named Tongva Peak in 2002, following a proposal by Richard Toyon.

Tongva Park is a park in Santa Monica, California. The park is located just south of Colorado Avenue, between Ocean Avenue and Main Street. The park includes an amphitheater, playground, garden, fountains, picnic areas, and restrooms. The park was dedicated on October 13, 2013.

<doc id="101143" wikidata="Q2586583" url="?curid=101143" title="Henny Youngman">
<text>Henry &quot;Henny&quot; Youngman (March 16, 1906 – February 24, 1998) was an English-born American comedian and musician famous for his mastery of the &quot;one-liner&quot;, his best known being &quot;Take my wife... please&quot;.

In a time when many comedians told elaborate anecdotes, Youngman&#x27;s routine consisted of telling simple one-liner jokes, occasionally with interludes of violin playing. These depicted simple, cartoon-like situations, eliminating lengthy build-ups and going straight to the punch line. Known as &quot;the King of the One-Liners&quot;, a title conferred to him by columnist Walter Winchell, a stage performance by Youngman lasted only 15 to 20 minutes but contained dozens of jokes in rapid succession.

==Early life==
Henry Youngman was born to Russian Jews Yonkel Yungman and Olga Chetkin in Whitechapel, in the East End of London, England. His family moved to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, New York, when he was a child. He grew up in New York City, took violin lessons and began as a comedian after he had worked for years at a print shop, where he wrote &quot;comedy cards&quot; containing one-line gags. The comedy cards were discovered by up-and-coming comedian Milton Berle, who encouraged Youngman and formed a close friendship with him. Berle said about him, &quot;The only thing funnier than Henny&#x27;s jokes is his violin playing.&quot;

==Career==

Encouraged by his family to study the violin, Youngman began in show business as a musician. He led a small jazz band called the Swanee Syncopaters, and during performances, he often told jokes. One night, the club&#x27;s regular comedian did not show up and the owner asked Youngman to fill in. He enjoyed it and began his long career as a comic. His inoffensive, friendly style of comedy kept his audiences laughing for decades. He first played in clubs and speakeasies, but his break came on Kate Smith&#x27;s radio show in 1937. Smith&#x27;s manager Ted Collins booked him on the show, became his manager, and secured an increasing number of appearances on such highly rated network radio shows as &quot;The Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast Hour&quot; hosted by Rudy Vallee.

During the 1940s, Youngman tried to work into films as an actor, but he found little work in Hollywood. He returned to nightclubs and worked steadily, performing as many as 200 shows per year. Working with writer/producer Danny Shapiro, in 1959 Youngman recorded &quot;The Primitive Sounds of Henny Youngman&quot;, a live album for National Recording Corporation performed at the Celebrity Club in St. Louis. Later, the album was re-released as a CD.

Like many comedians, Henny Youngman treated his profession as a working job, one where making a living is difficult, and getting paid for the work is all-important. In numerous interviews, Youngman&#x27;s advice to other entertainers was to (Yiddish for &quot;take the money&quot;).

He was quoted in an interview with the online magazine &quot;Eye&quot;: &quot;I get on the plane. I go and do the job, grab the money and I come home and I keep it clean. Those are my rules. Sinatra does the same thing, only he has a helicopter waiting. That&#x27;s the difference.&quot;

When the New York Telephone Company started its Dial-a-Joke in 1974, over three million people called in one month to hear 30 seconds of Youngman&#x27;s material—the most ever for a comedian.

Youngman never retired, and he performed his stage act in venues worldwide until his final days. As his fame passed into legendary status, he never considered himself aloof or above others, and he never refused to perform a show in a small venue or unknown club. In a tribute to Youngman, TV and animation producer Mark Evanier described him in a way that emphasized both his money consciousness and his love of performing:

He would take his fiddle and go to some hotel that had banquet rooms. He&#x27;d consult the daily directory in the lobby and find a party—usually a bar mitzvah reception—and he would go up to the room and ask to speak to whoever was paying for the affair. &quot;I&#x27;m Henny Youngman,&quot; he would tell that person. &quot;I was playing a date in another banquet room here and one of the waiters suggested you might want to have me do my act for your gathering here.&quot; He would negotiate whatever price he could get—$200, $500, preferably in cash—and he would do his act for them.

Roger Ebert described a similar episode in a 2011 film review:

I once observed Henny Youngman taping a TV show in the old NBC studios at the Merchandise Mart. We got into an elevator together. It stopped at the second floor, a private club. A wedding was under way. Youngman got off the elevator, asked to meet the father of the bride and said, &quot;I&#x27;m Henny Youngman. I&#x27;ll do 10 minutes for $100.&quot;

Youngman made numerous appearances on television, including a long-running stint on &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. In 1955, he hosted a TV series entitled &quot;The Henny and Rocky Show,&quot; appearing with champion boxer Rocky Graziano. He had cameo appearances in several movies, including &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot;; &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot;; and &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;

He had a larger role as the strip-club owner in Herschell Gordon Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Gore Gore Girls&quot;.

His autobiography is entitled &quot;Take My Life, Please!&quot;

Youngman&#x27;s last movie appearance was in Daniel Robert Cohn&#x27;s film &quot;Eyes Beyond Seeing,&quot; in which he has a cameo as a mental patient claiming to be Henny Youngman.

==Comedy routine==

Henny Youngman&#x27;s stage performances included a series of short, one-line jokes told in rapid succession. For example: &quot;A doctor gave his patient six months to live... but he couldn&#x27;t pay his bill, so he gave him another six months.&quot; Another example: &quot;My wife&#x27;s purse was stolen, but I didn&#x27;t cancel her credit cards. Why should I? The guy who stole &#x27;em spends less than she does!&quot;

He performed while holding his trademark prop of a violin and bow, occasionally playing a short interlude of &quot;Smoke Gets In Your Eyes&quot; on the violin in between jokes.

==Personal life==

Youngman&#x27;s wife Sadie Cohen was often the butt of his jokes (&quot;My wife said to me, &#x27;For our anniversary I want to go somewhere I&#x27;ve never been before.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Try the kitchen!, or &quot;My wife&#x27;s cooking is fit for a king. [Gesturing as if feeding an invisible dog.] Here, King; here, King!&quot; Also, &quot;Last night my wife said the weather outside was fit for neither man nor beast, so we both stayed home.&quot;) In reality, though, the two were very close, with Sadie often accompanying her husband on his tours. The Youngmans remained married for 59 years until Sadie&#x27;s death in 1987 after a prolonged illness. While she was ill, Henny had an ICU built in their bedroom so she could be taken care of at home (rather than in the hospital), as Sadie was terrified of hospitals.

Henny explained the origin of his classic line &quot;Take my wife, please&quot; as a misinterpretation: he took his wife to a radio show and asked a stagehand to escort his wife to a seat. But his request was taken as a joke, and Youngman used the line countless times ever after.

Youngman had two children, Gary and Marilyn. Gary started his career screenwriting and directing, continuing to work in the film industry in various capacities. Gary is best known for his 1976 film &quot;Rush It!&quot;

With the exception of a week following his wife&#x27;s death, and the month he was in his final hospital stay, Youngman worked almost every day for over seventy years without vacations or other breaks.

==Death==

Youngman developed pneumonia and died at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan on February 24, 1998, three weeks before his 92nd birthday. He is interred in the Mount Carmel Cemetery, Glendale, New York, next to his wife Sadie.

<doc id="101146" wikidata="Q30185" url="?curid=101146" title="Mayor">
<text>In many countries, a mayor is the highest-ranking official in a municipal government such as that of a city or a town. Worldwide, there is a wide variance in local laws and customs regarding the powers and responsibilities of a mayor as well as the means by which a mayor is elected or otherwise mandated. Depending on the system chosen, a mayor may be the chief executive officer of the municipal government, may simply chair a multi-member governing body with little or no independent power, or may play a solely ceremonial role. A mayor&#x27;s duties and responsibilities may be to appoint and oversee municipal managers and employees, provide basic governmental services to constituents, and execute the laws and ordinances passed by a municipal governing body (or mandated by a state, territorial or national governing 
body). Options for selection of a mayor include direct election by the public, or selection by an elected governing council or board.

The term &quot;mayor&quot; shares a linguistic origin with the military rank of &quot;major&quot;, both ultimately derived from French , which in turn derives from Latin , the comparative form of the adjective .

==History==
===United Kingdom===

In modern England and Wales, the position of mayor descends from the feudal lord&#x27;s bailiff or reeve (&quot;see borough&quot;). The chief magistrate of London bore the title of portreeve for considerably more than a century after the Norman Conquest. This official was elected by popular choice, a privilege secured from King John. By the beginning of the 12th century, the title of portreeve gave way to that of mayor as the designation of the chief officer of London, followed around 1190 by that of Winchester. Other boroughs adopted the title later.

In the 19th century, the Municipal Corporations Act 1882, Section 15, regulated the election of mayors. The mayor was to be a fit person elected annually on 9 November by the council of the borough from among the aldermen or councilors or persons qualified to be such. His term of office was one year, but he was eligible for re-election. He might appoint a deputy to act during illness or absence, and such deputy must be either an alderman or councilor. A mayor who was absent from the borough for more than two months became disqualified and had to vacate his office. A mayor was &quot;ex officio&quot; a justice of the peace for the borough during his year of office and the following year. He received such remuneration as the council thought reasonable. These provisions have now been repealed.

In medieval Wales, the Laws of Hywel Dda codified the mayor (Latin: &#x27;; Welsh: &#x27;) as a position at the royal courts charged with administering the serfs of the king&#x27;s lands. To maintain its dependence on and loyalty to the Crown, the position was forbidden to the leaders of the clan groups. A separate mayor, known as the &quot;cow dung mayor&quot; (), was charged with overseeing the royal cattle. There were similar offices at the Scottish and Irish courts.

The office of mayor in most modern English and Welsh boroughs and towns did not in the 20th century entail any important administrative duties and was generally regarded as an honor conferred for local distinction, long service on the council, or for past services. The mayor was expected to devote much of their time to civic, ceremonial, and representational functions, and to preside over meetings for the advancement of the public welfare. The administrative duties of mayors were to act as returning officer at parliamentary elections and to chair the meetings of the council.

The mayor of a town council is officially known as &quot;town mayor&quot; (although in popular parlance, the word &quot;town&quot; is often dropped). The person is known as &quot;mayor&quot; regardless of gender; the partner of a mayor is sometimes known as the &quot;mayoress&quot;. Since the 1974 local government reforms, mayors are also appointed to English local government districts which have borough status. This results in mayors of districts which include towns which also have separate mayors. In districts which do not have borough status, the role of civic leader is taken by the chairman of the council, who undertakes exactly the same functions as a mayor of a district with borough status.

Many major cities in the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth have a lord mayor, a special recognition bestowed by the sovereign. Although the position is often ceremonial, with executive responsibilities under the control of an elected mayor, lord mayors in several Commonwealth cities including Belfast, Cardiff, Brisbane, and Dublin hold both ceremonial and executive duties. Some lord mayors, including the Lord Mayor of Sydney (Australia), are elected.

In Scotland the post holders are known as convenors, provosts, or lord provosts depending on the local authority.

==== Directly elected mayors ====

Since reforms introduced in 2000, a number of English local authorities have directly elected mayors who combine the &quot;civic&quot; mayor role with that of leader of the council and have significantly greater powers than either.

Areas which now have directly elected mayors include cities, local government districts which cover several towns and rural areas, and since 2014 combined authority areas which include two or more local authority districts.

===Continental Europe===

The original Frankish mayors or majordomos were like the Welsh lords commanding the king&#x27;s lands around the Merovingian courts in Austrasia, Burgundy, and Neustria. The mayorship of Paris eventually became hereditary in the Pippinids, who later established the Carolingian dynasty.

In modern France, since the Revolution, a mayor () and a number of mayoral adjuncts () are selected by the municipal council from among their number. Most of the administrative work is left in their hands, with the full council meeting comparatively infrequently. The model was copied throughout Europe in Britain&#x27;s mayors, Italy&#x27;s sindacos, most of the German states&#x27; burgomasters, and Portugal&#x27;s presidents of the municipal chambers.

In Medieval Italy, the city-states who did not consider themselves independent principalities or dukedoms particularly those of the Imperial Ghibelline faction were led by .

The Greek equivalent of a mayor is the demarch ().

====Scandinavia====
In Denmark all municipalities are led by a political official called &quot;borgmester&quot;, &#x27;mayor&#x27;. The mayor of Copenhagen is however called &quot;overborgmester&quot; &#x27;lord mayor&#x27;. In that city other mayors, (plural), are subordinate to the lord mayor with different undertakings, like ministers to a prime minister. In other municipalities in Denmark there is only a single mayor.
In Norway and Sweden the mayoral title &quot;/&quot; has now been abolished. Norway abolished it in 1937 as a title of the non-political top manager of (city) municipalities and replaced it with the title (&#x27;alderman&#x27; or &#x27;magistrate&#x27;), which is still in use when referring to the top managers of the municipalities of Norway. The top &quot;elected&quot; official of the municipalities of Norway, on the other hand, has the title , which actually means &#x27;word-bearer&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;chairperson&#x27; or &#x27;president&#x27;, an equivalent to the Swedish word &quot;ordförande&quot;.

In Sweden was a title of the senior judge of the courts of the cities, courts which were called , literally &#x27;town hall court&#x27;, somewhat of an equivalent to an English magistrates&#x27; court. These courts were abolished in 1971. Until 1965, these mayor judges on historical grounds also performed some administrative functions in the board of magistrates, in Swedish known collectively as . Until 1965 there were also municipal mayors (), who had these non-political administrative roles in smaller cities without a magistrates&#x27; court or . This office was an invention of the 20th century as the smaller cities in Sweden during the first half of the 20th century subsequently lost their own courts and magistrates.
In the 16th century in Sweden, king Gustav Vasa considerably centralised government and appointed the mayors directly. In 1693 king Charles XI accepted a compromise after repeated petitions from the Estate of the Burgesses over decades against the royal mayor appointments. The compromise was that the burgesses in a city could normally nominate a mayor under the supervision of the local governor. The nominee was then to be presented to and appointed by the king, but the king could appoint mayors directly in exceptional cases. This was codified in the Instrument of Government of 1720 and on 8 July the same year Riksrådet (&quot;the Council of the Realm&quot;) decided, after a petition from the said Estate, that only the city could present nominees, not the king or anyone else. Thus the supervision of the local governor and directly appointed mayors by the king ceased after 1720 (the so-called Age of Liberty). On 16 October 1723, it was decided after a petition that the city should present three nominees, of whom the king (or the Council of the Realm) appointed one. This was kept as a rule from then on in all later regulations and was also kept as a tradition in the 1809 Instrument of Government (§ 31) until 1965.

In Finland, there are two mayors, in Tampere and Pirkkala. Usually in Finland the highest executive official is not democratically elected, but is appointed to a public office by the city council, and is called simply &#x27;city manager&#x27; or &#x27;municipal manager&#x27;, depending on whether the municipality defines itself as a city. The term &#x27;mayor&#x27;, from Swedish confusingly on historical grounds has referred to the highest official in the registry office and in the city courts (abolished in 1993) as in Sweden, not the city manager. In addition, is also an honorary title, which may be given for distinguished service in the post of the city manager. The city manager of Helsinki is called , which translates to &#x27;chief mayor&#x27;, for historical reasons. Furthermore, the term &quot;city manager&quot; may be seen translated as &quot;mayor&quot;.

====Spain====

The office of the &quot;Alcalde&quot; evolved during the Reconquista as new lands were settled by the expanding kingdoms of León and Castile. As fortified settlements in the area between the Douro and Tagus rivers became true urban centers, they gained, from their feudal lords or the kings of Leon and Castile, the right to have councils. Among the rights that these councils had was to elect a municipal judge ( in Latin and in Spanish). These judges were assisted in their duties by various assistant judges, called , whose number depended on the number of parishes the town had. The title was borrowed from the Arabic &quot;al-qaḍi&quot; (), meaning &#x27;the judge&#x27;.

The word originally was used for simple judges, as in Andalusian Arabic. Only later was it applied to the presiding municipal magistrate. This early use continued to be reflected in its other uses, such as , the judges in the &quot;audiencias&quot;; , who formed the highest tribunal in Castile and also managed the royal court; , a synonym for &quot;corregidor&quot;; and , who were roughly the equivalent of British parish constables. Because of this, the municipal was often referred to as an .

==Mayors by country==
===Armenia===

Mayors in Armenia are the head of the executive branch of municipal government. Mayors are often elected by the respective city council and serve for a five-year term. The mayor heads the community administration, nominates members of the administration to various posts, and oversees the municipal budget.

===Australia===

In Australian councils, the mayor is generally the member of the council who acts as a ceremonial figurehead at official functions, as well as carrying the authority of the council between meetings. Mayoral decisions made between meetings are subject to council and may be confirmed or repealed if necessary. Mayors in Australia may be elected either directly through a ballot for the position of mayor at a local-government election, or alternatively may be elected from within the council at a meeting.

The civic regalia and insignia of local government have basically remained unaltered for centuries. For ceremonial occasions a mayor may wear robes, a mayoral chain and a mace. Mayors have the title of &quot;His/Her Worship&quot; whilst holding the position.

In councils where councillors are elected representing political parties, the mayor is normally the leader of the party receiving the most seats on council. In Queensland, the lord mayor and mayors are elected by popular vote at the general council election.

===Bangladesh===

Mayors in Bangladesh are elected every five years. They are very powerful in municipal government. The mayor is the highest-ranking official in municipal governments in Bangladesh.

===Brazil===
Every municipality in Brazil elects a mayor (Portuguese: ) and a vice-mayor (Portuguese: ) for a four-year term, acting as an executive officer with the city council (Portuguese: ) functioning with legislative powers. The mayor can be re-elected and manage the city for two consecutive terms.

Mayoral elections in Brazil occur in two different ways: in municipalities with more than 200,000 inhabitants, the voting happens in a two-round system, like the presidential and gubernatorial elections. In municipalities with less than 200,000 inhabitants, the voting happens in a relative majority system (with only one round).

The Brazilian system works similarly to the mayor-council government in the United States.

===Canada===
The chief executives of boroughs (&quot;arrondissements&quot;) in Quebec are termed mayors ( in French). A borough mayor simultaneously serves as head of the borough council and as a regular councillor on the main city council. The scheduling of municipal elections in Canada varies by jurisdiction, as each province and territory has its own laws regarding municipal governance.

As is the practice in most Commonwealth countries, in Canada a mayor is addressed as His/Her Worship while holding office.

====Reeve====

In a few municipalities and townships in Ontario, the reeve is the elected head of the municipality, and the second-in-command is referred to as the deputy reeve. Historically, in some small townships, the title &quot;reeve&quot; was used instead of mayor. In some other municipalities, &quot;mayor&quot; and &quot;reeve&quot; were two separate offices, with the mayor retaining leadership powers while the reeve was equivalent to what other municipalities called an &quot;at-large councillor&quot;. Today most municipalities in the province now designate their elected municipal government heads as mayors, but a small handful retain the position. This continues to be the case in the following municipalities and townships:
* Howick Township, Huron County
* North Huron Township, Huron County
* Beckwith Township, Lanark County
* Drummond/North Elmsley Township, Lanark County
* Lanark Highlands, Lanark County
* Montague Township, Lanark County
* Tay Valley Township, Lanark County
* Township of The Archipelago, Parry Sound District
* Alberton Township, Rainy River District
* Chapple Township, Rainy River District
* La Vallee Township, Rainy River District
* Morley Township, Rainy River District
* Dorion Township, Thunder Bay District
* Gilles Township, Thunder Bay District
* Brethour Township, Timiskaming District
* Casey Township, Timiskaming District
* Chamberlain Township, Timiskaming District
* Municipality of Charlton and Dack, Timiskaming District
* Evaturel Township, Timiskaming District
* Gauthier Township, Timiskaming District
* Harley Township, Timiskaming District
* Harris Township, Timiskaming District
* Hilliard Township, Timiskaming District
* Hudson Township, Timiskaming District
* James Township, Timiskaming District
* Kerns Township, Timiskaming District
* Village of Thornloe, Timiskaming District

The reeve is also the chief elected official in most of Alberta&#x27;s municipal districts.

The elected heads of rural municipalities (RM) in the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan are usually referred to as a reeve.

===Dominican Republic===
The mayor of a municipality in the Dominican Republic is called indistinctly or . The latter name is preferred to avoid confusing the title with the similar-sounding (lit. &#x27;prison warden&#x27;). Such a person is the governor of the municipality whose township elected him (or her) by direct vote for a term of four years. The daily duties of the mayor&#x27;s office are restricted to local governance, and as such, it is responsible for the coordination of waste collection, upkeep of public spaces (e.g., parks, undeveloped urban parcels, streets), traffic light control, sewage, and most public utilities. In practice, most of its duties are centered on minor street repairs (new or large road projects, like overpasses, bridges, pedestrian crossings, etc. are handled by the Ministry of Public Works (), under the direct control of the central government. Subcontracting garbage collection and management, overseeing the use of public spaces, and arbitrating neighborhood land use disputes, which are managed by the National Property office (), is also controlled by the mayor&#x27;s office. Water, electrical supply and public transportation coordination are handled by several central government offices, and as such, are not under the control of the mayor.

===France===

Mayors () are elected for a six-year term by the municipal council, whose members are elected by direct universal suffrage in local elections held every six years.

===Germany===
In Germany, local government is regulated by state statutes. Nowadays only the mayors of the three city-states (Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen) are still elected by the respective city-state parliaments. In all the other states the mayors are now elected directly by the EU citizens living in that area. The post of mayor may be said to be a professional one, the mayor being the head of the local government, and requiring, in order to be eligible, training in administration. In big cities (details are regulated by state statutes) the official title is (mayor). In these cities, a &quot;simple&quot; mayor is just a deputy responsible for a distinct task (e.g., welfare or construction works). Big cities are usually &quot;kreisfrei&quot; (&#x27;district-free&#x27;). That means that the city council also has the powers and duties of a rural district council. The leader of a rural district council is called (&#x27;land counsellor&#x27;). In that case, the chief mayor also has the duties and powers of a .

There are also some German states that allow smaller cities to have an &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; as well. In Saarland, for instance, every city with more than 35,000 inhabitants has one, and in Saxony-Anhalt every city with a population bigger than 25,000 has one. The term is not used in the three city-states, where the mayors are simultaneously head of state governments, but (Governing Mayor of Berlin), (First Mayor of the city-state of Hamburg) and (President of the Senate and Mayor of Bremen) are used. However, the term was used for the head of the state government of West Berlin until 1951 and was also used in East Berlin from 1948 to January 1991.

===Greece===
Mayors (, , sing. , &quot;dēmarchos&quot;) in Greece were previously elected every four years in local elections and are the head of various municipal governments in which the state is divided. Starting in 2014, mayors are elected for a five-year term. Local administration elections for the new, consolidated municipalities and peripheries will henceforth be held together with the elections for the European Parliament.

Local administration in Greece recently underwent extensive reform in two phases: the first phase, implemented in 1997 and commonly called the Kapodistrias Plan, consolidated the country&#x27;s numerous municipalities and communities down to approximately 1000. The second phase, initially called Kapodistrias II but eventually called the Kallikratis Plan, was implemented in 2010, further consolidated municipalities down to 370, and merged the country&#x27;s 54 prefectures, which were disbanded in favour of the larger 13 regions. The Kallikratian municipalities were designed according to several guidelines; for example, each island (except Crete) was incorporated into a single municipality, while the majority of small towns were consolidated so as to have an average municipal population of 25,000.

===India===

In India, the mayor is the first citizen of a city and the head of municipal corporation which is a local government of cities with a population over one million. They have a number of roles, both ceremonial and functional. In most Indian states mayors are elected indirectly among the corporators (who are directly elected by the people of their respective wards) of the municipal corporation, except in nine states: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Uttarakhand, where mayors are elected directly by the public.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, mayor (, formerly called and ) is a regional head of a city or town. A mayor has the same level as a regent (&quot;bupati&quot;), head of a regency (&quot;kabupaten&quot;). Basically, a mayor has the duty and authority to lead the implementation of the policies established by the region along with the city council (&quot;Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Kota&quot;, DPRD Kota; formerly called Tier 2-DPRD (&quot;DPRD Tingkat II&quot;)). A mayor is elected in a pair with a vice mayor through direct elections and is a political office. An exception is Special Capital Region of Jakarta, where mayoralty is a civil-service career position with limited authority and is designated by the governor. Their regions are called administration cities (&quot;kota administrasi&quot;).

Before 1999, there were administrative cities (&quot;kota administratif&quot;, [id]) which were headed by administrative mayors.

===Iran===
In Iran, the mayor is the executive manager of a city and is elected by the Islamic City Council. The mayor is elected for a four-year term.

===Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, the head of a borough corporation was called &quot;mayor&quot; from the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 until boroughs were abolished by the Local Government Reform Act 2014. City council chairs are &quot;mayor&quot; (or &quot;lord mayor&quot; in the cases of Dublin and of Cork). The Local Government Act 2001 allowed county councils to style their chairperson as &quot;mayor&quot; and some do so. Since 2000 there have been proposals for a directly elected mayor of the Dublin Metropolitan Area. The 2019 local elections included plebiscites in three areas on directly elected mayors, of which that for Mayor of Limerick was passed, with the first direct election due as part of the 2024 local elections.

===Italy===
In Italy, the mayor is called , or informally (&#x27;first citizen&#x27;). Every municipality () has a mayor who represents the local government. The mayor is directly elected every five years by the inhabitants of the &quot;comune&quot;; the mayor cannot serve for more than two consecutive terms, except in municipalities of up to 5,000 inhabitants, those having a three consecutive terms limit.

The mayor is a member of the City council, the legislative body which checks the mayor&#x27;s policy guidelines and is able to enforce his resignation by a motion of no confidence, and is entitled to appoint and release the members of the executive body ().

===Japan===
Japan&#x27;s Local-Autonomy Law of 1947 defines the structure of Japanese local governments, which were strengthened after World War II. It gives strong executive power to the mayor in local politics like strong mayors in large cities in the United States of America. The titles that are translated as &quot;mayor&quot; by the governments are those of the heads of cities , towns , villages , and Tokyo&#x27;s special wards (The head of the Tokyo prefecture is the ).

A mayor is elected every four years by direct popular votes held separately from the assembly. A mayor can be recalled by a popular initiative but the prefectural and the national governments cannot remove a mayor from office. Towards the assembly the mayor prepares budgets, proposes local acts and may veto local acts approved by the assembly which can be overridden by two-thirds assembly support. A mayor can dissolve the assembly if the assembly passes a motion of no confidence or if the mayor thinks the assembly has no confidence in fact.

===Kazakhstan===

In Kazakhstan, the mayor is called &quot;akim&quot;, who is the head of an , a municipal, district, or provincial government (), and serves as the presidential representative. &quot;s&quot; of provinces and cities are appointed to the post by the president on the advice of the prime minister. Meanwhile, the &quot;s&quot; of other administrative and territorial units are appointed or elected to the post in an order defined by the president. The president may also dismiss &quot;s&quot; from their posts. The &#x27; powers end upon the newly elected president of the republic taking office. Thus, the continue to fulfill their duties before the appointment of the corresponding by the President of Kazakhstan.

===Malaysia===

The mayor functions as the head of the local government of the cities in Malaysia. To date, there are 14 officially-recognised cities in the country.

In cities which lie within the jurisdiction of any one of the 13 Malaysian states, the mayor is appointed by the state government. Kuala Lumpur, the country&#x27;s capital, is a notable exception, as it forms part of the Federal Territories which come under the purview of the Malaysian federal government, via the Ministry of Federal Territories. Thus, the mayor of Kuala Lumpur is selected by, and subordinate to, the Minister of Federal Territories.

Following the 2018 general election, which saw the country undergoing its first ever regime change, there have been calls to revive local government elections, which had been the practice in certain cities such as Kuala Lumpur, George Town, Ipoh and Melaka until their abolishment in 1965. The reinstatement of local government elections would lead to the mayoral position being elected, instead of being appointed as per the current system.

===Malta===
In Malta, the mayor () is the leader of the majority party in the local council. The members of the local councils are directly elected and collectively serve as a basic form of local government.

===Moldova===
The mayor of the municipality in Moldova is elected for four years. In Chișinău, the last mayoral elections had to be repeated three times because of the low rate of participation.

===Nepal===

Mayors in Nepal are elected every five years in the local elections. They are very powerful in municipal government. The mayor is the highest-ranking official in a municipal government in Nepal.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the mayor () is the leader of the college of mayor and aldermen (&quot;College van Burgemeester en Wethouders&quot;), the municipal executive. In the Netherlands, &quot;s&quot; are &quot;de facto&quot; appointed by the national cabinet, &quot;de jure&quot; by the monarch. Appointment is generally preceded by a selection procedure and nomination by the municipal council and king&#x27;s commissioner (head of the provincial executive), and a nomination is only very rarely not followed by an appointment. Mayors preside over both the municipal executive and the legislative (&quot;gemeenteraad&quot;), although they can vote in the former and not in the latter. The title is sometimes translated as burgomaster, to emphasise the appointed, rather than elected, nature of the office. The appointment procedure was brought for discussion in the early 2000s (decade), as some of the political parties represented in parliament regarded the procedure as undemocratic. Generally, mayors in the Netherlands are selected from the established political parties, although since the late 2010s mayors without political affiliation have become more common. Alternatives proposed were direct election of the mayor by the people or official appointment by the municipal council (). A constitutional change to allow for this failed to pass the Senate in March 2005, but succeeded in 2018.

===New Zealand===
Mayors in New Zealand are elected every three years in the local body elections.

===Pakistan===

In Pakistan, a city is headed by the district &quot;nazim&quot; (the word means &#x27;administrator&#x27; in Urdu, but is sometimes translated as &#x27;mayor&#x27;) and assisted by the &quot;naib nazim&quot;, who is also speaker of the district council. The district is elected by the of union councils, union councillors and by tehsil , who themselves are elected directly by the votes of the local public. Council elections are held every four years.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, mayors () are the head of a municipality or a city, with the vice mayor as the second-highest position in the city. They are elected every three years during the midterm and national elections, and they can serve up to three consecutive terms of office. , there are 1,635 mayors in the Philippines.

===Poland===

As of 30 April 2022, there are altogether 2477 municipalities (gmina) in Poland, including 1513 rural gminas, while the remaining 968 ones contain cities and towns. Among them, 666 towns are part of an urban-rural gmina while 302 cities and towns are standalone as an urban gmina. The latter group includes 107 cities (governed by a &quot;prezydent miasta&quot;), including 66 cities with powiat rights. 37 cities among the latter group are over 100,000, including 18 cities serving as a seat for voivode or voivodeship sejmik, informally called voivodeship cities.

All municipalities in Poland including cities and towns are governed under the mandatory mayor–council government system. Executive power is vested in an official called one of the following:
* a city mayor (&quot;prezydent miasta&quot;)
* a town mayor (&quot;burmistrz&quot;) 
* a &quot;wójt&quot; which is the equivalent office in a rural municipality (&quot;gmina wiejska&quot;)

They are elected by a two-round direct election for a five-year term concurrently with the five-year term of the municipal council and cannot serve in the latter or in any higher-level deliberative bodies: a county council, a voivodeship sejmik, the Parliament of Poland or the European Parliament. Citizens with a criminal record cannot run for mayor, but only if sentenced for intentional criminal offence prosecuted ex officio. The municipal/town/city council is the legislative, budget-making and oversight body. Mayor is obliged to appoint his deputy. A town or city mayor may be scrutinized or denied funding for his/her projects by the council, but is not politically responsible to it and does not require its confidence to remain in office; therefore, cohabitation is not uncommon. A recall referendum may however be triggered through a petition supported by at least 1/10 of eligible voters, but the turnout in the recall referendum must be at least 3/5 of the number of people voting in the original election in order for the referendum to be valid and binding. A town/city mayor can also be dismissed by the prime minister in case of persistent transgression of the law.

Town/city mayors manage the municipal estate, issue administrative decisions and minor regulations, and incur liabilities within limits set by the municipal council. They prepare and present the planned budget to the municipal council, subject to its acceptation and amendments. After the municipal council votes to accept the budget, the town/city mayor is responsible for its realization. Town/city mayors are heads of the town/city hall (office), the register office (the town/city mayor may appoint deputies for these specific tasks), as well as the parent authority for all public kindergartens and elementary schools in the municipality. They are also personally responsible for the emergency management and civil defense in a municipality. A municipality itself is responsible among others for public transport, water supply and treatment, and waste management. A town/city mayor has the legal capacity to act as employer for all the officials of a town/city hall. Town/city mayors in Poland have wide administrative and staffing authority: the only municipal executive official that the town/city mayor cannot appoint or dismiss is a city treasurer, who is appointed by the town/city council. Although they do not have in Poland power to veto city council resolutions, their position is relatively strong and should be classified as a mayor-council government.In a city with powiat rights, the city mayor also has the powers and duties of a powiat executive board and a starosta.

In addition, an office of quarter mayor (&quot;burmistrz dzielnicy&quot;) exists in the auxiliary units of the city of Warsaw, called quarters. In spite of remaining an integral part of the city as an entity, the quarters have a degree of autonomy legally guaranteed through a form of an own local self-government exercising some powers devolved by law from the city. Each of the 18 city quarters has an own council (&quot;rada dzielnicy&quot;) which elects an executive board (&quot;zarząd dzielnicy&quot;) headed by a quarter mayor (&quot;burmistrz dzielnicy&quot;), the latter elected by the council among several candidates nominated by the city mayor of Warsaw among the council&#x27;s members, as opposed to a town or a city mayor, both elected under direct suffrage.

===Portugal===
In Portugal and many other Portuguese-speaking countries the mayor of a municipality is called the (&#x27;President of the Municipal Chamber&#x27;).

===Romania===
In Romania, the mayor of a commune, town or city is called . The is elected for a period of four years. In carrying out their responsibilities they are assisted by an elected local council (). Bucharest has a general mayor () and six sector mayors (), one for each sector. The responsibilities of the mayor and of the local council are defined by Law 215/2001 of the Romanian Parliament.

===Russia===
In Russia, the , from French (transliteration: – not to be confused with the NATO OF-3 rank – English: &quot;major&quot;), is one of the possible titles of the head of the administration of a city or municipality. This title is equivalent to that of the head of a Russian rural district. Exceptionally, the of Moscow, Saint-Petersburg and Sevastopol are equivalent to governors in Russia, since these three federal cities are Russian federal subjects.

Except for the aforementioned three large cities, the governance system of a Russian municipality (city, county, district or town) is subordinate to the representative council of the federation in which it is located. The is either directly elected in municipal elections (citywide referendum) or is elected by the members of the municipality&#x27;s representative council. Election by council members is now more widespread because it better integrates with the Russian federal three-level vertical governance structure:

# National government:
## President (executive)
## Federal Assembly
# Federation governments:
## Heads of federation (commonly governors)
## Regional representative councils
# Local governments:
## Heads of administration (who have the official title of , whether or not local law defines it as such)
## Local representative councils

The typical term of office of a in Russia is four years. The &quot;&#x27;s&quot; office administers all municipal services, public property, police and fire protection, and most public agencies, and enforces all local and state laws within a city or town.

According to Medialogy, the of Novosibirsk, Anatoly Lokot&#x27;, is mentioned in the media more than any other Russian mayor. The of Kazan, Il&#x27;sur Metshin, is the most popular in Russia, scoring 76 out of 100, according to the Russian People&#x27;s Rating of &quot;s&quot;.

The status of the post in Sevastopol is not legally recognized outside of the Russian Federation.

===Serbia===
In Serbia, the mayor is the head of the city or a town. The mayor acts on behalf of the city, and performs an executive function. The position of the mayor of Belgrade is important as the capital city is the most important hub of economics, culture and science in Serbia. Furthermore, the post of the mayor of Belgrade is the third most important position in the government after the prime minister and president. The &quot;Local Administration Act of 2007&quot; establishes a mayor-council system for all municipalities, except city municipalities that are part of a city. The title of the mayor varies: the formal title of municipality heads is the &quot;President of Municipality&quot; (&#x27;) while cities are headed by mayors (&#x27;); both are, however, called &quot;gradonačelnik&quot; in everyday parlance. The mayor is elected indirectly by the city council for a term of 4 years, without a term limit; previously, from 1990 to 2006 mayors were elected directly by voters in local elections alongside the municipal council.

===Spain and Hispanic America===

&quot;Alcalde&quot; is the most common Spanish term for the mayor of a town or city. It is derived from the (), i.e., &#x27;the (Sharia) judge&#x27;, who often had administrative, as well as judicial, functions. Although the Castilian and the Andalusian had slightly different attributes (the oversaw an entire province, the only a municipality; the former was appointed by the ruler of the state but the latter was elected by the municipal council), the adoption of this term reflects how much Muslim society in the Iberian Peninsula influenced the Christian one in the early phases of the &quot;Reconquista&quot;. As Spanish Christians took over an increasing part of the Peninsula, they adapted the Muslim systems and terminology for their own use.

Today, it refers to the executive head of a municipal or local government, who usually does not have judicial functions. The word &quot;intendente&quot; is used in Argentina and Paraguay for the office that is analogous to a mayor.

In &quot;municipios&quot; and larger cities in Mexico, the chief executive is known as both or as (&#x27;municipal president&#x27;), with the latter being more widely used.

===Sweden===
The Swedish title (burgomaster) was abolished in the court reform of 1971 when also the towns of Sweden were officially abolished.

===Switzerland===
The function and title for mayor vary from one canton to another. Generally, the mayor presides over an executive council of several members governing a municipality.

The title is:
* In Italian: (Ticino), (Grigioni)
* In French: (Geneva, Jura, Bern), (Vaud, Fribourg), (Valais), (Neuchâtel)
* In German: e.g. , , , 

===Taiwan===
In the Republic of China in Taiwan the mayor is the head of the city&#x27;s government and its city&#x27;s council, which is in charge of legislative affairs. The mayor and city council are elected separately by the city&#x27;s residents.

===Turkey===
Mayors () in Turkey are elected by popular vote for five years alongside the municipal council. As a rule, there are municipalities in all province centers and district centers as well as towns () which are actually villages with a population in excess of 2000. However, beginning by 1983, a new level of municipality was introduced in the Turkish administrative system. In big cities, metropolitan municipalities () are established. (See metropolitan municipalities in Turkey) In a metropolitan municipality there may be several district municipalities (hence mayors). Mayors are elected in local elections.

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine the title &quot;head of the city&quot; (; unofficially the foreign adaptation also is present) was introduced in 1999. Since then, the post is elected by all residents of the city. Before that date, the post was elected by members of the city council only and was known as head of the city council, which &quot;ex officio&quot; also serves as the head of the executive committee. For the cities that carry special status such as Kyiv and Sevastopol, the head of the city was a matter of long debate and the post is regulated by special laws.

Since 2015 a post of (&#x27;elder&#x27;) has been implemented at the lower level of the administrative-territorial pyramid. Candidates to the post are also elected by members of the territorial community (). The post is historical and existed in the territory of Ukraine during the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

===United States===

The mayor is the municipal head of government, the maximum civil authority at the municipal level, in most United States municipalities (such as cities, townships, etc.). In the United States, there are several distinct types of mayors, depending on whether the system of local government is council-manager government or mayor-council government.

Under the council-manager government system, the mayor is a first among equals on the city council, which acts as a legislative body while executive functions are performed by the appointed manager. The mayor may chair the city council, but lacks any special legislative powers. The mayor and city council serve part-time, with day-to-day administration in the hands of a professional city manager. The system is most common among medium-sized cities from around 25,000 to several hundred thousand, usually rural and suburban municipalities.

Under the mayor-council system, the mayoralty and city council are separate offices. This system may be of two types, either a strong mayor system or a weak mayor system. Under the &quot;strong mayor&quot; system, the mayor acts as an elected executive with the city council exercising legislative powers. They may select a chief administrative officer to oversee the different departments. This is the system used in most of the United States&#x27; large cities, primarily because mayors serve full-time and have a wide range of services that they oversee. In a &quot;weak mayor&quot; or &quot;ceremonial mayor&quot; system, the mayor has appointing power for department heads but is subject to checks by the city council, sharing both executive and legislative duties with the council. This is common for smaller cities, especially in New England. Charlotte, North Carolina, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, are two notable large cities with a ceremonial mayor.

Many American mayors are styled &quot;His Honor&quot; or &quot;Her Honor&quot; while in office.

A 2014 analysis found no difference in performance between male and female mayors in the United States, and no evidence of a positive role model effect from female mayors inspiring future candidates. In 2016 author Mirya R. Holman wrote that female mayors &quot;emphasize nurturer parent frames more frequently whereas male mayors emphasize strict father frames, but they discuss economic development at very similar levels&quot;.

==Multi-tier local government==
In several countries, where there is no local autonomy, mayors are often appointed by some branch of the national or regional government. In some cities, subdivisions such as boroughs may have their own mayors; this is the case, for example, with the arrondissements of Paris, Montreal, and Mexico City. In Belgium, Brussels is administratively one of the federation&#x27;s three regions, and is subdivided, without the other regions&#x27; provincial level, into 19 rather small municipalities, with one, the City of Brussels, being the kingdom&#x27;s capital, which each have an elected—formally appointed—burgomaster (i.e., mayor, responsible to his/her elected council); while Antwerp, the other major metropolitan area, has one large city (where the boroughs, former municipalities merged into it, elect a lower level, albeit with very limited competence) and several smaller surrounding municipalities, each under a normal burgomaster as in Brussels.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the mayor () may be the administrative head of any municipality, provincial, prefecture-level, or county-level. The mayor is usually the most recognized official in cities, although the position is the second-highest-ranking official in charge after the local Communist Party secretary. In principle, the mayor (who also serves as the deputy Communist Party secretary of the city) is responsible for managing the city administration while the Communist Party secretary is responsible for general policy and managing the party bureaucracy, but in practice the roles blur, frequently causing conflict.

==Acting mayor==
Acting mayor is a temporary office created by the charter of some municipal governments.

In many cities and towns, the charter or some similar fundamental document provides that in the event of the death, illness, resignation, or removal from office of the incumbent mayor, another official will lead the municipality for a temporary period, which, depending on the jurisdiction, may be for a stated period of days or months until a special election can be held, or until the original end of the term to which the vacating mayor was elected.

Some cities may also provide for a deputy mayor to be temporarily designated as &quot;acting mayor&quot; in the event that the incumbent mayor is temporarily unavailable, such as for health reasons or out-of-town travel, but still continues to hold the position and is expected to return to the duties of the office. In this latter capacity, the acting mayor&#x27;s role is to ensure that city government business can continue in the regular mayor&#x27;s absence, and the acting mayor is not deemed to have actually held the office of mayor. In some jurisdictions, however, when a mayor resigns or dies in office, the mayor&#x27;s successor is not considered to be an acting mayor but rather fully mayor in their own right.

The position of acting mayor is usually of considerably more importance in a mayor-council form of municipal government, where the mayor performs functions of day-to-day leadership, than it is in a council-manager or committee system forms of government, where the city manager or the local council&#x27;s committees respectively provide day-to-day leadership and the position of mayor is either a largely or entirely ceremonial one.

<text>The Unisphere is a spherical stainless steel representation of the Earth at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York City, New York. The globe was designed by Gilmore D. Clarke for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Commissioned to celebrate the beginning of the space age, the Unisphere was conceived and constructed as the theme symbol of the World&#x27;s Fair. The theme of the World&#x27;s Fair was &quot;Peace Through Understanding&quot;, and the Unisphere represented the theme of global interdependence, being dedicated to &quot;Man&#x27;s Achievements on a Shrinking Globe in an Expanding Universe&quot;.

Clarke devised plans for the Unisphere while aboard an airplane in 1960. New York City Department of Parks and Recreation commissioner Robert Moses, who had already rejected two plans for iconic structures at the 1964 fair, approved Clarke&#x27;s proposal in early 1961. After further refinements, the Unisphere was constructed by American Bridge Company, a division of U.S. Steel, from March to August 1963. Over 51 million people visited the Unisphere during the World&#x27;s Fair, after which it became a permanent attraction of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. The Unisphere became an unofficial symbol of Queens after the World&#x27;s Fair. In the 1970s, the Unisphere was not maintained and became visibly dirty; it was restored in the early 1990s. The Unisphere was made a New York City designated landmark in 1995 and, after another period of disrepair, it was restored in the early 2010s.

The Unisphere measures high and in diameter. It sits atop a tripod base with over 500 steel pieces representing the countries, as well as three steel rings representing the first artificial satellites orbiting Earth. Around the Unisphere is a reflecting pool measuring in diameter, surrounded by 48 pairs of fountainheads.

== History ==
Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, a former ash dump in the New York City borough of Queens, was used for the 1939/1940 New York World&#x27;s Fair. At the conclusion of the fair, it was used as a park. The Flushing Meadows site was selected in 1959 for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Gilmore David Clarke and Michael Rapuano, designers of the original World&#x27;s Fair layout, were retained to tailor the original 1939 park layout for the new fair. New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses was president of the World&#x27;s Fair Corporation, which leased the park from the city until 1967, after the fair&#x27;s completion.

===Planning===
After the 1964 fair was announced, Moses wished to make a symbol that represented the fair&#x27;s theme of &quot;Peace Through Understanding&quot;, which would also have some &quot;significance or meaning for the average person&quot;. The symbol would also celebrate the beginning of the space age. Moses first asked designer Walter Dorwin Teague to make a &quot;Theme Center&quot;. Teague designed the center as a inverted cone surrounded by a spiral, rising from a reflecting pool. Moses declined the proposal, calling it a &quot;cross between a part of a brake engine and a bed spring, or should I say between a Malayan Tapir and a window shutter&quot;. Another proposal was devised by Paul Rudolph on behalf of the Portland Cement Association. This plan called for a saucer measuring in diameter and tilted 18 degrees from the ground, with a restaurant, exhibits, educational and recreational facilities, and &quot;planetary viewing stations&quot;. Moses also rejected Rudolph&#x27;s proposal.

The idea for the Unisphere occurred in September 1960 as Clarke was doodling on an airplane from Ohio to New York. Clarke had sketched a metal armillary on the rear of an envelope. By the time he got to his office, Clarke had refined his plan into a revolving globe with rings of latitude and longitude. Clarke asked another architect working under his office, William S. Boice, to sketch the structure. Since the method of the sculpture&#x27;s revolution had not yet been determined, Boice drew fountains to conceal the base. The Unisphere was conceptually designed in aluminum with metallic mesh continents. The globe would be tilted 23.5 degrees and would measure across. Capital cities would be represented on the globe by three sizes of lights, with larger lights for capitals deemed more important. Clarke showed the plan to Moses, who approved of it.

Moses announced plans for the Unisphere in February 1961. The Unisphere would be erected at the site of the Perisphere of the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair which was dismantled after the Fair, Moses commented that he &quot;never understood&quot; the Perisphere and its Trylon. According to Moses, the Unisphere &quot;illustrates, symbolizes and embodies man&#x27;s achievements on a shrinking globe in an expanding universe&quot;. The structure was to be constructed by American Bridge Company, a division of U.S. Steel. Further refinements were made by another of Clarke&#x27;s architects, Peter Martecchini, who decided to place three columns at the globe&#x27;s pedestal after playing with a rubber ball belonging to one of his sons. Martecchini developed a working model for a moving platform, composed of three pegs, each topped by a pair of metal disks and a toothed disk with a bolt, supporting a plywood platform. A model of the proposed work was unveiled in 1962.

Clarke&#x27;s idea underwent a further refined industrial design in stainless steel by industrial designers at Peter Muller-Munk Associates. Some of the original design details were controversial. Several landmasses such as Cyprus and Crete had been left out of the original design, and the lights representing capital cities were criticized on the grounds that the process of selecting &quot;important&quot; capitals was subjective. U.S. Steel rejected the idea of a spinning globe due to high costs, though it did retain Martecchini&#x27;s idea of a three-pointed pedestal. In addition, the globe was reduced from after Clarke talked with U.S. Steel&#x27;s board chairman Roger Blough, who said the globe would only be as high as a ten-story brick building outside his office. The final design was similar to the original, but the fountains were arranged differently.

=== Construction and World&#x27;s Fair ===

Construction on the Unisphere started on March 6, 1963. The globe was built within 110 days, and the last landmass was installed on August 13, 1963. When the Unisphere was being built, Blough took credit for the structure. He also gave an award to M. Legrain-Eiffel, whose grandfather Gustave Eiffel&#x27;s company had designed and built the Eiffel Tower. The Unisphere was dedicated in early March 1964, and the base of the Unisphere hosted a dance ball the same month, attended by four hundred people. U.S. Steel constructed the Unisphere for free; as compensation, the company&#x27;s name was placed on marketing materials throughout the fair.

The globe became the icon of the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair. A special commemorative stamp issue was issued starting in April 1964, depicting fair attractions such as the Unisphere. The globe was also depicted on media and souvenirs promoting the fair. The Unisphere&#x27;s popularity was also increased by the presence of fountainheads around the globe&#x27;s base, which cooled down fair visitors on hot days. During the fair, dramatic lighting at night gave the effect of sunrise moving over the surface of the globe. Additionally, the capitals of nations were marked by lights. One of these lights is placed at the location of the Kahnawake First Nations reserve, which the Mohawk ironworkers requested to be placed there to honor their labor. Over the course of the fair, many of its 51 million visitors passed by the Unisphere.

=== 1960s to 1990s ===
In March 1966, after the conclusion of the fair, U.S. Steel donated $100,000 to make the Unisphere a permanent attraction at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. These funds were allocated toward a lighting system for the globe, as well as a water-recirculation system for the pools. The park was reopened the next year following a major renovation, and the Unisphere was permanently retained as a park feature. At first, the park was lightly used, and a &quot;Newsday&quot; article in 1969 reported that the fountains at the Unisphere had been turned off. The globe was covered in grime by the 1970s, while the pools were shut off and tagged with graffiti. In 1978, the US Open tennis tournament was moved from the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills to Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. Parts of the park were repaired or expanded for the tournament, including the fountains of the Unisphere, which were reactivated in 1978 for the first time in ten years. In 1983, officials celebrated the 300th anniversary of Queens&#x27;s founding at the base of the Unisphere.

Arne Abramowitz became administrator of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in 1986 and soon began planning a renovation of the park. The following year, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) announced an $80 million rehabilitation of the park. The renovation had been planned since the early 1980s but had been deferred due to a lack of funding. By this time, the city was shutting off the Unisphere&#x27;s fountains during festivals to prevent people from wading into them. The restoration called for new mechanical systems, lighting, retaining walls, benches, paving, and trees to be installed in Unisphere Plaza at a cost of between $5.7 and $5.9 million. A second phase would landscape the surrounding grounds for $40 million. In 1989, a NYC Parks official observed that landmasses of countries like India and Vietnam would be lifted from their mountings on particularly windy days.

The grounds around the Unisphere were landscaped in 1992, but the renovation of the Unisphere itself was delayed due to a lack of money. Preservationists objected when some of the trees around the Unisphere, dating to the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair, were removed and replaced with trees that were easier to maintain. The restoration of the Unisphere, which began in 1993, included numerous structural repairs and removal of grime accumulation on the steel. The fountains were replaced and new floodlighting was installed. Furthermore, two of the surrounding lawns were planted with rose gardens. As part of the park-wide renovation, the entrance of the Queens Museum, to the west, was relocated so it faced the Unisphere directly, rather than in the opposite direction. The restoration was completed in May 1994. Architectural critic Herbert Muschamp wrote that, while &quot;nothing can compensate for the loss of context around this metallic centerpiece&quot;, the globe had started to gleam &quot;with something like its former high spirits&quot;. That year, the Annual Building Awards in Queens gave the Unisphere an award for best rehabilitation.

In February 1995, several Queens residents petitioned to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) to designate the Unisphere as an official city landmark. Although the structure was only thirty years old, one speaker said &quot;its symbolism precedes its age&quot;. At the time, there were relatively few city landmarks in Queens compared to the total number of landmarks citywide, but other structures such as the Lewis H. Latimer House and Vander Ende–Onderdonk House were receiving landmark protection. The LPC designated the Unisphere as a landmark that May. Though the landmark status ensured the Unisphere&#x27;s preservation, other relics of the 1939 and 1964 World&#x27;s Fairs had become dilapidated or were being demolished at the same time.

=== 2000s to present ===

The fountains at the Unisphere&#x27;s base were shut off in 2001 due to citywide water restrictions; they were not reactivated until early 2003, seventeen months later. The pool around the globe was also drained because Mayor Michael Bloomberg had prohibited water from being used for ornamental purposes. By 2008, city officials planned to fix the pipes under the Unisphere. At the time, the fountains leaked excessively; to save money, NYC Parks only operated the fountains throughout the entire day whenever the US Open was being held. Due to concerns by city officials that people would wade into the pools, some officials had proposed several years prior that the Unisphere be surrounded by a fence or bushes, but former parks commissioner Henry Stern had expressed opposition to such proposals. Local media reported in 2009 that grass had begun to grow within the steel mass representing Antarctica. NYC Parks officials suspected that bird feces and an accumulation of leaves had contributed to an environment in which seeds could germinate.

The Unisphere&#x27;s fountains were rededicated on August 12, 2010, after a $2 million restoration of the pumps, valves, and paintwork. The refurbished fountains operated daily during the summer for the first time in more than two decades. In the September 2010 Brooklyn–Queens tornadoes, the landmass representing Sri Lanka was blown off the Unisphere. The piece was reinstalled the following year. After the fountains were turned back on, visitors often played within the pool and fountains, especially after a neighboring set of fountains to the east broke down. This was despite the fact that people were technically not allowed to enter the pool and fountains. To prevent people from being hurt by the powerful fountainheads, NYC Parks added barricades, opened fire hydrants, and hired patrol officers to deter people from going into the pool area. Even so, some people still entered the pool area.

==Design==
===Globe===
The Unisphere is the world&#x27;s largest globe. It measures in diameter, rises , and weighs . Including its inverted tripod base, which is made of sturdy low-alloy steel, the Unisphere weighs . The globe is constructed of Type 304L stainless steel. The continents on the globe are fabricated with a special texture-pattern by Rigidized Metals Corporation. The horizontal beams on the frame are meant to represent longitude lines. Over five hundred pieces of steel were used in the construction of the globe. The Unisphere is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees, which is the angle of the Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane to the plane of its orbit about the sun.

Three large orbit rings of stainless steel encircle the Unisphere at various angles. These orbit rings are believed to represent the tracks of Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space; John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth; and Telstar, the first active communications satellite. The early design was to have a ring for each of a dozen satellites in place at the time of the World&#x27;s Fair. This proved impractical, not only in the number of satellites but also in the height of their orbits and the fact that geostationary satellites had no orbit path. As a result, a symbolic number of three was chosen for aesthetic reasons. The three rings were connected with aircraft cable to the rest of the structure. Another proposal entailed having lights revolve around the satellite rings, but this idea was also decided against.

The landmasses of the Unisphere are made of metal sheets that are laid in contours. The shapes had to be placed at regular intervals while also accurately representing the globe, and could not be cross-braced or overly thick; furthermore, wind was trapped by the shapes&#x27; concave inner surfaces. As such, a stress transfer pattern was developed, and the meridians and parallels were varied in dimension, thereby making the Unisphere structurally stable as well as accurate in design. U.S. Steel&#x27;s administrative vice president Austin J. Paddock said that some 670 mathematical equations needed to be solved simultaneously to determine the exact layout of the Unisphere. The shape of the steel sheets was devised using a computer. The surface area of the landmasses totals over , effectively acting as a large sail.

===Base===
The Unisphere is centered in a circular reflecting pool, with a floor of poured concrete surrounded by a bulkhead of granite and concrete. Forty-eight pairs of fountainheads, on the outer edge of the pool, are designed to obscure its tripod pedestal. Prior to the 1990s renovation, there were 48 single fountainheads. Two pumps in the pool recycle the water that is used in the fountainheads. The effect is meant to obscure the tripod supporting the Unisphere, making the globe appear as if it is floating in space. From the perimeter of the reflecting pool, the Unisphere is meant to depict the Earth as seen from away.

The Unisphere is built on a concrete foundation, which includes the piling ring that supported the Perisphere of the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. The marshy soil of Flushing Meadows needed special consideration during the original 1937 Perisphere construction. The Perisphere, and subsequently the Unisphere, employed a foundation of 528 pressure-creosoted Douglas fir piles of in length. Before construction of the Unisphere, three piles were tested for structural integrity and all were found to be sound throughout their entire length. Six hundred additional piles were built specifically for the Unisphere.

=== Surroundings ===
Pathways radiate axially from the Unisphere to the north, northeast, southeast, and south. There are plaques facing the four major paths that extend from the Unisphere. The courts of the former Louis Armstrong Stadium, to the north, had been oriented along the same axis as the Unisphere. Additionally, a pair of promenades extend east of the Unisphere, with the Fountains of the Fairs between the paths. The entrance to the Queens Museum is directly west of the Unisphere, while the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center is to the north and the New York State Pavilion is to the south.

== Impact ==

=== Reception ===
When it was proposed, the Unisphere received negative reviews. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; quoted people who called it &quot;probably one of the most uninspired designs we have ever seen&quot;, while &quot;Newsday&quot; opined that the globe was &quot;deathly dull&quot; and &quot;looks like an ad for Western Union&quot;. &quot;&quot; magazine criticized the design as &quot;a heavy, literal version of the ancient armillary sphere, with decoration by Rand McNally&quot;. Ralph Caplan wrote for &quot;Industrial Design&quot; that Moses&#x27;s defense of the Unisphere was motivated by animosity toward the older structure. &quot;Progressive Architecture&quot; described it as &quot;like the set for the &#x27;spectacular&#x27; finale of a 1930s Warner Brothers musical&quot;. Walter McQuade wrote for &quot;The Nation&quot; that the Unisphere was a &quot;bit of roadside inspirational decoration, a trite cartoon in iron&quot; that portended badly for the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair, while Bruno Zevi for Italian magazine &quot;L&#x27;Architettura cronache e storia&quot; called it a &quot;silly idea&quot; and petitioned U.S. President John F. Kennedy to prevent the Unisphere from being installed.

Only one positive criticism emerged when the globe was announced when the National Arts Club called it &quot;one of the outstanding achievements in structural sculpture of this decade.&quot; Remarking on the initial negative reception of the Unisphere in 2010, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said that the Unisphere was perceived as a symbol of the &quot;banal, corporate atmosphere&quot; of the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair. Despite the largely negative criticism of the Unisphere from architectural critics, it was positively received by the visitors. After the fair, the Unisphere remained a tourist attraction into the 21st century. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in 2014, said the Unisphere was the only relic of the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair that &quot;was untarnished by time and enhanced by memory&quot;.

=== Symbolism and media ===
According to &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine, &quot;The Unisphere became the space age logo of the fair, a steel Earth at the Ptolemaic hub of a Googie-style Jetsons universe&quot;, despite the overall limited success of the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair. The Unisphere became an unofficial symbol of Queens after the World&#x27;s Fair. In 1990, the office of the Queens borough president depicted the Unisphere in its insignia, and advertisements for Continental Airlines and Bloomingdale&#x27;s also depicted the globe. By the mid-1990s, it was being shown in numerous commercials and as a part of several montages of New York City. One person interviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who depicted the Unisphere on her products, said that the Unisphere had become popular because &quot;People have run out of symbols of New York&quot;.

The Unisphere has been used as a setting or backdrop for several films and TV episodes, notably the American sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot;; the television show &quot;&quot;; the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;, &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot;, and &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;; and the movie &quot;Men in Black&quot;. The Unisphere has been shown frequently in music videos, in particular those from the New York hip-hop scene, such as A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s &quot;Award Tour&quot; and Craig Mack&#x27;s &quot;Flava in Ya Ear&quot;.

=== Climbs ===
Several people have climbed the Unisphere throughout its history. In 1976, George Willig and Jerry Hewitt scaled the structure for a short documentary made by New York University student Paul Hornstein, who had wanted &quot;to prove that we can do a full-scale, high-quality movie production on our own&quot;. A member of the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion also climbed the Unisphere in September 2019 to hang a banner protesting the 2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires. At least two climbers have died after slipping from the Unisphere: a 23-year-old who fell from the side of the structure in 1976, and a man who fell into the globe in 1990.

<text>The governor of Maryland is the head of government of the U.S. state of Maryland and is the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The governor is the highest-ranking official in the state, and the constitutional powers of Maryland&#x27;s governors make them among the most powerful governors in the United States.

The current governor is Democrat Wes Moore, who took office on January 18, 2023.

== Governors ==

Maryland was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on April 28, 1788. Before it declared its independence, Maryland was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain.

Under the constitution of 1776, governors were appointed by the General Assembly legislature to one-year terms. They could be reelected for two additional terms, though they must take four years off after leaving office. An 1838 constitutional amendment allowed for popular election of governors to three-year terms, though they could not succeed themselves. The 1851 constitution removed the term limit, and lengthened terms to four years, to commence on the second Wednesday of January following the election. Governors were limited to two consecutive terms beginning in 1948.

The office of lieutenant governor was created in 1864, abolished in 1867, and recreated in 1970. The lieutenant governor succeeds to the office of governor should it become vacant. In the original constitution, the first named of the Governor&#x27;s Council would act as governor if it were vacant, until a new governor was selected; this was changed to the secretary of state in 1837. The 1867 constitution originally called for the General Assembly to immediately elect a new governor; if they were not in session, the president of the Senate would act as governor until one was elected.

<doc id="101149" wikidata="Q2709326" url="?curid=101149" title="Pecos Bill">
<text>Pecos Bill ( ) is a fictional cowboy and folk hero in stories set during American westward expansion into the Southwest of Texas, New Mexico, Southern California, and Arizona. These narratives were invented as short stories in a book by Tex O&#x27;Reilly in the early 20th century and are an example of American &quot;fakelore&quot;. Pecos Bill was a late addition to the larger-than-life characters, such as Paul Bunyan or John Henry.

==History==
The first known stories were published in 1917 by Edward O&#x27;Reilly for &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;, and collected and reprinted in 1923 in the book &quot;Saga of Pecos Bill&quot;. O&#x27;Reilly claimed they were part of an oral tradition of tales told by cowboys during the westward expansion and settlement of the southwest, including Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. But American folklorist Richard M. Dorson found that O&#x27;Reilly invented the stories as &quot;folklore&quot;, and that later writers either borrowed tales from O&#x27;Reilly, or added further adventures of their own invention to the cycle.

Edward O&#x27;Reilly co-authored a cartoon strip with cartoonist Jack A. Warren, also known as Alonzo Vincent Warren, between 1929 and 1938. When O&#x27;Reilly died in 1946, Warren began a strip titled &quot;Pecos Pete&quot;. This was a story about &quot;Pecos Bill&quot;, who had received a &quot;lump on the naggan&quot; that caused him amnesia. The cartoons originally were published in &quot;The Sun&quot; and were later syndicated. He also has a wife, named Slue-Foot Sue.

Pecos Bill made the leap to film in the 1948 Walt Disney animated feature &quot;Melody Time&quot;. He was portrayed by Steve Guttenberg in a 1985 episode of &quot;Tall Tales &amp; Legends&quot; and by Patrick Swayze in Disney&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Tall Tale&quot;.

&quot;Pecos Bill&quot; was also the nickname of Civil War general William Shafter, although this was before O&#x27;Reilly created the legend. Shafter was considered a hero in Texas, and even had some legendary poetry written about how tough he was.

According to legend, Pecos Bill is responsible for creating many landmarks. One landmark he is said to have created is the Gulf of Mexico. Apparently, there was a drought in Texas that was so horrible, that Pecos rushed to California and lassoed up a storm cloud and brought it to Texas. It rained so much that the Gulf of Mexico was created. Another story is of him creating the Rio Grande River. He and his horse got stranded in the desert and needed water. So Pecos grabbed a stick and dug the Rio Grande River. One other landmark that he is responsible for is the Painted Desert. He apparently started shooting at a tribe of Indigenous Americans, and as they ran away, the ritual paint they had on them came off and painted the desert.

==Description==
According to the &quot;legend&quot;, Pecos Bill was born in Texas in the 1830s (or 1845 in some versions, the year of Texas&#x27;s statehood). Pecos Bill&#x27;s family decided to move out because his town was becoming &quot;too crowded.&quot; Pecos Bill was traveling in a covered wagon as an infant when he fell out unnoticed by the rest of his family near the Pecos River (thus his nickname). He was taken in and raised by a pack of coyotes. Years later he was found by his real brother, who managed to convince him he was not a coyote.

He grew up to become a cowboy. Bill used a rattlesnake named Shake as a lasso and another snake as a little whip. His horse, Widow-Maker (also called Lightning), was so named because he was Texas&#x27;s first and most notorious serial killer, leaving a trail of dead bodies clear across Texas (this is another version of how the Rio Grande was made). Dynamite was said to be his favorite food. It is also said Bill sometimes rode a cougar instead of a horse. On one of his adventures, Pecos Bill managed to lasso a twister. It was also said that he once wrestled the Bear Lake Monster for several days until Bill finally defeated it.

Pecos Bill had a sweetheart named Slue-Foot Sue, who rode a giant catfish down the Rio Grande. He was fishing with the pack when he saw her. Shake, Widow-Maker, and Slue-Foot Sue are as idealized as Pecos Bill.

After a courtship in which, among other things, Pecos Bill shoots all the stars from the sky except for one which becomes the Lone Star, Bill proposes to Sue. She insists on riding Widow-Maker before, during or after the wedding (depending on variations in the story). Widow-Maker, jealous of no longer having Bill&#x27;s undivided attention, bounces Sue off; she lands on her bustle and begins bouncing higher and higher. Bill catches her, but then gets pulled with her. The town folks assumed both Bill and Sue were bounced away to another place or both ended up on the Moon where they stayed and were never seen again.

In James Cloyd Bowman&#x27;s version of the story, Sue eventually recovers from the bouncing, but is so traumatized by the experience she never speaks to Pecos Bill ever again.

In a few other versions, Bill attempts, but fails, to lasso her, because of an interference by Widow-Maker who did not want her on his back again (or for that matter didn&#x27;t want her coming between his and Bill&#x27;s friendship), and she eventually hits her head on the Moon. After she has been bouncing for days, Pecos Bill realizes that she would eventually starve to death, so he lassos her with Shake the rattlesnake and brings her back down to Earth. Widow-Maker, realizing that what he did to her was wrong, apologizes and is forgiven.

In other versions, Sue could not stop bouncing, and Bill could not stop her from bouncing either, so Bill had to shoot her to put her out of her misery. Though it is said that Bill was married many times, he never loved the others as much as Sue, and the other relationships did not work out.

In the &quot;Melody Time&quot; version, Bill was apparently responsible for the California Gold Rush and M.F. Stephenson&#x27;s famous &quot;There&#x27;s gold in them thar hills&quot; phrase. He knocked out the gold fillings of a gang of rustlers when they tried to steal his cow, scattering the fillings across the landscape. Bill also creates the Lone Star long before he meets Sue. Additionally, in this version Sue gets stranded on the Moon due to Widow-Maker&#x27;s interference in preventing Bill from lassoing her, after which a disheartened Bill leaves civilization to rejoin the coyotes, who now howl at the Moon in honor of Bill&#x27;s sorrow for Sue.

In the more popular versions, including many children&#x27;s books, Bill and Sue reunite, and get married happily ever after.

In a school story book (leveled reader), Bill finds a tornado and lassos it, and then they reunite.

In Laura Frankos&#x27; short story &quot;Slue-Foot Sue and the Witch in the Woods&quot; (1998), Sue&#x27;s bustle-ride deposits her in Russia, where she must fight a duel with Baba Yaga.

In the &quot;Pecos Bill&quot; episode of &quot;Tall Tales &amp; Legends&quot; (1985), Sue is played by Rebecca De Mornay.

Sue does not figure in the 1995 Pecos Bill film &quot;Tall Tale&quot;; however, her fatal &quot;bouncing to the Moon&quot; story is briefly narrated by Patrick Swayze&#x27;s Bill, with Sue substituted by a man named Lanky Hank.

<doc id="101151" wikidata="Q96749544" url="?curid=101151" title="Hors d'oeuvre">
<text>An hors d&#x27;oeuvre ( ; ), appetiser or starter is a small dish served before a meal in European cuisine. Some hors d&#x27;oeuvres are served cold, others hot. Hors d&#x27;oeuvres may be served at the dinner table as a part of the meal, or they may be served before seating, such as at a reception or cocktail party. Formerly, hors d&#x27;oeuvres were also served between courses.

Typically smaller than a main dish, an hors d&#x27;oeuvre is often designed to be eaten by hand. Hors d&#x27;oeuvre are typically served at parties as a small &quot;snack&quot; before a main course.

==Etymology==
 in French literally means &#x27;outside the work&#x27;, that is &quot;not part of the ordinary set of courses in a meal&quot;. In practice, it is a dish which stands on its own as a snack or supports the main course. The French spelling is the same for singular and plural usage. In English, the typographic ligature is usually replaced by the digraph and two plural forms are acceptable: &quot;hors d&#x27;&quot; (same as singular) or &quot;hors d&#x27;&quot; (pronounced ).

==Origins==
A small number of food historians believe that the tradition may have begun in Russia, where small snacks of fish, caviar and meats were common after long travels. However, it may be that the custom originated in China, possibly coming through the Steppes, into Russia, Scandinavia, France and other European countries. The tradition may have reached Italy, Greece and the Balkan nations through Russia or Persia. Many national customs are related, including the Swedish smörgåsbord, Russian zakuska, middle eastern mezze, and Italian antipasto. During the Roman Period the meal practice was to have two main courses which were supplemented before the meal with small amounts of fish, vegetables, cheeses, olives and even stuffed dormice. These would be served at the start of the meal known as either &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;. The Greeks called the appetiser course &quot;&quot;. As early as 500 CE, the Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Yoma&quot; 83b) recounts the practice of feeding sweet desserts to a person before the main course of a meal in order to revive his strength and increase his appetite (Aramaic: מגרר גריר).

===French service===
During the Middle Ages formal French meals were served with entremets between the serving of plates. These secondary dishes could be either actual food dishes, or elaborate displays and even dramatic or musical presentations. In the 14th century, recipes for entremets were mostly made with meat, fish, pork and vegetables. By the 15th century the elaborate display and performances were served up between courses, and could be edible or displays of subjects relevant to the host, created in butter sculpture or other types of crafted work. With the introduction in the 17th century of &quot;service à la française&quot;, where all the dishes are laid out at once in very rigid symmetrical fashion, entremets began to change in meaning but were still mainly savoury. Along with this came elaborate silver and ceramic table displays as well as pièces montées. The entremets were placed between the other dishes within the main work of the meal.

At about this time in the 17th century, smaller dishes began to be served by being placed outside the main work of symmetrically placed dishes. These were known as hors d&#x27;oeuvre. Hors d&#x27;oeuvres were originally served as a canapé of small toasted bread with a savoury topping before a meal. The first mention of the food item was by François Massialot in 1691, mentioned in his book: &quot;Le cuisinier roial et bourgeois&quot; (The Royal and Bourgeois Cook) and explained as &quot;Certain dishes served in addition to those one might expect in the normal composition of the feast&quot;. In the French publication &quot;Les plaisirs de la table&quot;, Edouard Nignon stated that hors d&#x27;oeuvres originated in Asia. He went on to state that the French considered hors-d&#x27;oeuvres to be to a well cooked meal. &quot;Service à la française&quot; continued in Europe until the early 19th century. After the 19th century the entremet would become almost exclusively a sweet dish or dessert with the British custom of the &quot;savoury&quot; being the only remaining tradition of the savoury entremet.

The style of formal dining changed drastically in the 19th century, becoming successive courses served one after the other over a period of time. Some traditional hors d&#x27;oeuvres would remain on the table throughout the meal. These included olives, nuts, celery and radishes. The changing, contemporary hors d&#x27;oeuvres, sometimes called &quot;dainty dishes&quot;, became more complicated in preparation. Pastries, with meat and cream sauces among other elaborate items, had become a course served after the soup.

===English savouries===
As a result of French influence on the English language, &quot;hors d&#x27;oeuvre&quot; has become a commonly used term in English to refer to small dishes served before meals. The custom of the savoury course is of British origin and comes towards the end of the meal, before dessert or sweets or even after the dessert, in contrast to the hors d&#x27;oeuvre, which is served before the meal. The British favored the savoury course as a palate cleanser before drinking after the meal, which made the hors d&#x27;oeuvre before the meal unnecessary. The savoury is generally small, well spiced and often served hot, requiring cooking just before serving. In the Victorian and Edwardian periods, savouries included such toppings as fried oysters wrapped in bacon, and Scotch woodcock, which was a savoury made of scrambled eggs, ground black pepper and Gentleman&#x27;s Relish on buttered toast, served hot. In France, cheese was often part of the savoury course or added with simple fruit as a dessert. A typical Edwardian dinner might consist of up to four courses that include two soups, two types of fish, two meats, ending with several savouries then sweets.

===American appetisers and cocktail hors d&#x27;oeuvres===
The term &quot;appetiser&quot; (American English: &quot;appetizer&quot;) is a synonym for hors d&#x27;oeuvre. It was first used in the United States and England simultaneously in 1860. Americans also use the term to define the first of three courses in a meal, an optional one generally set on the table before guests were seated. Drinks before dinner became a custom towards the end of the 19th century. As this new fashion caught on, the British took inspiration from the French to begin serving hors d&#x27;oeuvres before dinner. A cocktail party is considered a small gathering with mixed drinks and light snacks. Hors d&#x27;oeuvres may be served as the only food offering at cocktail parties and receptions, where no dinner is served afterward. After the end of prohibition in the United States, the cocktail party gained acceptance. Prior to the First World War, American dinner guests would be expected to enter the dining room immediately where drinks would be served at the table with appetisers. This changed by the 1920s, when hors d&#x27;oeuvres were served prior to a non-alcoholic cocktail; however, after the repeal of Prohibition in the United States, cocktail parties became popular with many different hors d&#x27;oeuvres meant as something to help counter the stronger drinks. It is the cocktail party that helped transfer the hors d&#x27;oeuvres from the formal dining table to the mobility of the serving tray. These appetisers passed around the cocktail party may also be referred to as canapés.

==Preparation==
In restaurants or large estates, hors d&#x27;oeuvres are prepared in a &quot;garde manger&quot; which is a cool room. Hors d&#x27;oeuvres are often prepared in advance. Some types may be refrigerated or frozen and then precooked and then reheated in an oven or microwave oven as necessary before serving.

==Use==
If there is an extended period between when guests arrive and when the meal is eaten, for example during a cocktail hour, these might serve the purpose of sustaining guests during the wait, in the same way that apéritifs are served as a drink before meals.

It is also an unwritten rule that the dishes served as hors d&#x27;oeuvres do not give any clue to the main meal. They are served with the main meal menu in view either in hot, room temperature or cold forms; when served hot they are brought out after all the guests arrive so that everyone gets to taste the dishes.

Hors d&#x27;oeuvres before a meal may be rotated by waiters or passed. Stationary hors d&#x27;oeuvres served at the table on a tray may be referred to as table hors d&#x27;oeuvres or as buffet-style. Passed hors d&#x27;oeuvres provided by servers are part of butler-style service. or butlered hors d&#x27;oeuvres.

==Examples==

Though any food served before the main course is technically an hors d&#x27;oeuvre, the phrase is generally limited to individual items, such as cheese or fruit. A glazed fig topped with mascarpone and wrapped with prosciutto is an hors d&#x27;oeuvre, and plain figs served on a platter may also be served as hors d&#x27;oeuvres. It could be pickled beets or anchovy eggs as topping over tomatoes as part of the initial &quot;drinks&quot; session such as of alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages. They are also served in the forms of dips, spreads, pastries, olives or nuts with or without a base of egg, cheese, meats, vegetables, seafood or breads. Single cold items served are smoked salmon, avocado pear, caviar, pâté, shellfish cocktails and melon with garnishes and decorations. Seasoned hot dishes served are of vegetables, meat, fish, egg, pasta, cheese, soufflés, tartlets, puff pastry or choux pastry.

Crudités from France are a blend of salads of raw vegetables and the serving has a minimum of three vegetables of striking colors. &quot;Zakuski&quot; are hors d&#x27;oeuvres in Russian cuisine and other post-Soviet cuisines, served in the form of a buffet of cured meats and fishes. In Italian &quot;antipasto&quot; means it is served cold in the form of olive, cheese, pickled vegetables; other similar hors d&#x27;oeuvres can be found in the rest of Southern Europe under different names ( in Portuguese, or in Spanish). in Dutch means the dish (&quot;) before (&quot;) the main course. Fattoush is a bread salad in Levantine cuisine made from toasted or fried pieces of pita bread () combined with mixed greens and other vegetables. It belongs to the family of dishes known as (plural) or fatta, which use stale flatbread as a base.

===In the United States===
In the United States the custom appears to have come from California, where a foreign saloon owner may have put out trays of simple hors d&#x27;oeuvres to serve his customers. This tradition soon became the 5-cent beer and free lunch in early America before prohibition ended the custom.

In the U.S., &#x27;&quot;appetizers&quot;&#x27;, referring to anything served before a meal, is the most common term for hors d&#x27;oeuvres. Light snacks served outside of the context of a meal are called hors d&#x27;oeuvres (with the English-language pluralization).

====Hawaii====
In the Hawaiian language hors d&#x27;oeuvres and appetisers are called &quot;&quot;. Hawaiian culinary influences are very diverse due to the multiple ethnicities living in the islands. This diversity, along with the Americanization of entertaining in the mid 20th century led to the Hawaiian Cocktail and the &quot;pūpū&quot; (hors-d&#x27;oeuvre) served at the beginning of luaus. This invention of a faux Polynesian experience is heavily influenced by Don the Beachcomber, who is credited for the creation of the &quot;pūpū&quot; platter and the drink named the &quot;Zombie&quot; for his Hollywood restaurant. At Don&#x27;s the food was traditional Cantonese cuisine served with a fancy presentation. The first &quot;pūpū&quot; platters were eggrolls, chicken wings, spare ribs as well as other Chinese-American foods. Eventually Trader Vic would create the Mai Tai in his restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Tiki bar would become an American cocktail tradition.

===In Oceania===
Hors d&#x27;oeuvres, also called amuse-bouches, served around bars in Australia are oysters and alsace foie gras. Appetisers in New Zealand are lamb skewer or blue cod sliders. In New Zealand the Māori call their snacks &quot;Kai Timotimo&quot;. Kiribati appetisers served include pastes made from chickpeas and eggplant, meat dishes with spices and wheat. Samoan foil chicken and roast pork, tidbits of meat in a smoky, spicy sauce are appetisers in Samoa. In Tonga, puu-puus or appetisers served are Waikiki shrimp and grilled pineapple with dipping sauce.

===In other countries===
Appetisers served in Kenya are raw and fresh vegetables and assorted dips with decorations. Before modern-day hors d&#x27;oeuvre were introduced from Europe into South Africa, starters served consisted of eastern fish and cooked bone marrow served with bread.

Locust Fork is located along one of the two major Alabama state highways that run northeast from Birmingham to the Sand Mountain area of Guntersville, Albertville, and Boaz. It is an alternate route from Birmingham to Huntsville and Chattanooga.

The Locust Fork area has and continues to see strong residential growth mainly due to outflow from Jefferson County as residents there seek a more rural environment as well as a lower tax structure. As a result of this growth, enrollment in schools has risen substantially. Also, traffic along the main Highway 79 artery has risen, and the road has become increasingly dangerous between the termination of a four-lane divided highway just north of Pinson and Locust Fork. There has been some discussion of upgrading the road to four-lane status, but such work is still considered several years away. Locust Fork will also be impacted by the eventual construction of the Northern Beltline, which is slated to cross Highway 79 just north of Pinson. This controlled-access highway (officially designated as Interstate 422) will provide much quicker access for Locust Fork residents traveling east to Trussville or westward to Gardendale, Graysville, and Tuscaloosa. However, this route is still 10–15 years away from completion.

==Government==

Locust Fork is an incorporated town and has a mayor and town council elected by the citizens. The mayor and council are elected for four-year terms. The current mayor is Weslie Powell, and the current council members are Adam Youngblood (Mayor Pro-Tem), Sabrina Peeples, Barbara Richey, Joseph Lay and Joey White.

The high school football stadium is named Gary Pate Field in honor of a former Locust Fork football coach. The Lady Hornets Basketball Team won the 2016-2017 AHSAA 3A State Championship, the first State Championship of any kind for Locust Fork High School.

<text>Bracknell Forest is a unitary authority area in Berkshire, southern England. It covers the two towns of Bracknell and Sandhurst and the village of Crowthorne and also includes the areas of North Ascot, Binfield, Warfield, and Winkfield. The borough borders Wokingham and the Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead in Berkshire, and also parts of Surrey and Hampshire.

==History==
The district was formed as Easthampstead Rural District under the Local Government Act 1894 as a successor to the Easthampstead rural sanitary district. Originally a small rural district, its population was about 20,000 during World War II. Bracknell, in the district, was one of the first post-war new towns to be designated, and became a civil parish in 1955, created from parts of Binfield, Easthampstead, Warfield and Winkfield parishes. Bracknell had originally been a hamlet at the far south-west of Warfield parish.

The district&#x27;s population rose rapidly, and reached 64,135 by the 1971 census. In 1974 the district was reconstituted as the non-metropolitan district of Bracknell under the Local Government Act 1972. It changed its name in May 1988 to Bracknell Forest, at the same time as it was granted borough status.

On 1 April 1998, Berkshire County Council was abolished, as a consequence of the Banham Review, and Bracknell Forest Borough Council became a unitary authority. From 2008, references to &#x27;borough&#x27; were phased out in favour of simply Bracknell Forest Council.

Since 1973, Bracknell Forest has been twinned with Opladen in Germany, continued by Leverkusen after Opladen&#x27;s incorporation in 1975.

There are 265 Listed Buildings in the borough of which 254 are Grade II, 10 are Grade II* and 1 is Grade I.

There are five sites in the borough included on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens: Ascot Place, Broadmoor Hospital, Newbold College, South Hill Park and Windsor Great Park.

Bracknell Forest Borough Council&#x27;s offices at Time Square in Market Street were featured in an episode of &quot;Road Wars&quot; on 4 February 2010 when a pursuit ended in the carpark.

==Geography==
Two rivers run through Bracknell Forest: the River Blackwater forms the borough&#x27;s southern boundary, and the Cut meanders through the northern parishes. These receive water from small streams within the borough namely the Bull Brook in the north which feeds into the Cut and the Wish stream which flows into the River Blackwater. The built and developed proportion of the Borough amounts to about 35% of the total land area. Extensive forests cover more than 20% of the total area, consisting principally of parts of Windsor Forest; predominantly conifer plantation owned and managed by the Crown Estate and Forestry Commission. Agricultural land covers 24% of the land, located mainly in the north of the borough.

More than 20% of the borough is recognised as being of a high wildlife value and protected by some form of designation. Nine sites in Bracknell Forest are designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), comprising 1911.5 hectares or 17.48% of the Borough&#x27;s total area. The largest, Broadmoor to Bagshot Woods &amp; Heaths SSSI was designated in 2001 to include the majority of Swinley Forest.

The Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area (SPA), 1356 hectares of which lie within Bracknell Forest (Sandhurst to Owlsmoor Bogs and Heaths SSSI and the Broadmoor to Bagshot Woods and Heaths SSSI), supports nationally important populations of Dartford warblers, nightjars and woodlarks, all of which are Annex I species of the Birds Directive, and a small breeding population of hobbies, an important migratory species in a European context.

==Demographics==
Bracknell Forest is generally affluent (ranked 291 out of 326 on the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2010, Rank of Average Score) with significantly lower than average unemployment levels. Property prices and levels of car ownership are significantly higher than the national average. However deprivation does exist in the borough -central Bracknell is within the 30% most deprived areas in England, with several other parts of the town also within the more deprived half of England. In contrast, almost all of Crowthorne, Sandhurst, and the borough&#x27;s rural fringes fall into the 10% least deprived areas in England. Household incomes are also significantly lower than other areas of similar deprivation, being close to the national average.

According to the Office for National Statistics figures the borough&#x27;s population is 113,696. 77% of the borough&#x27;s population, aged between 16 and 74 years are economically active with the service sector employing the largest proportion, 46.4% of this group. Only 11% of the population is of pensionable age, compared to a national average of 18%, with 7% being over 75 years old.

There are many distinctive local geographical communities within Bracknell Forest, from Sandhurst and Crowthorne in the south, the semi-rural communities of Binfield, Winkfield and Warfield in the north and the former new town of Bracknell in the centre, which contains most of the Borough&#x27;s commercial and industrial areas.

With respect to ethnicity, according to the Office for National Statistics, the vast majority of the Borough&#x27;s residents (89.6%) consider themselves to be &#x27;White&#x27;. The second largest group is defined as &#x27;Asian&#x27; at 4.34%, third as &#x27;Black&#x27; at 2.35%, fourth as Mixed at 1.82%. With regard to religious affiliation, the population is predominantly Christian (77.8%), followed by those who have no religion (19.4%), Hindus (1.1%), Muslims (0.7%), Buddhists (0.3%), other religions (0.3%), Jews (0.2%) and Sikhs (0.2%).

The population is quite healthy comparing well regionally and nationally with life expectancy at 80.15 years.

==Industry==
Bracknell Forest is a base for high-tech industries and home to companies such as Panasonic, Fujitsu (formerly ICL) and Fujitsu Siemens Computers, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Sharp Corporation, Tracks Laser &amp; Electronics and LSI Corporation. The software development and computer services side of the industry also thrives in Bracknell Forest and includes companies like Cable and Wireless, Honeywell, Avnet, Novell, and RSA Security. Pharmaceutical and engineering companies also draw together in Bracknell Forest, these include Boehringer Ingelheim, Syngenta, Minebea, Daler-Rowney and Hyundai Heavy Industries.

Bracknell is also home to the central Waitrose distribution centre and head office which is on a 70-acre (280,000 m2) site on the Southern Industrial Estate. Waitrose has operated from the town since the 1970s. The town is also home to the headquarters of Avis Europe.

==Swinley Forest==

There is no forest called &#x27;Bracknell Forest&#x27;. This name is often confused with Swinley Forest (or Woods), which is an area of the Windsor Estate between Bracknell and Bagshot. Owned and managed by the Crown Estates, it comprises of woodland (mainly Scots pine). It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and has protected areas for the birds that live there.

It also provides some of the best mountain biking in South-East England, with many off-road &#x27;single-track&#x27; trails available as well as plenty of fire roads. In recent years, Swinley forest has also been used as a filming location for a number of films including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Parts 1 &amp; 2.

<text>Daniel Little McFadden (born July 29, 1937) is an American econometrician who shared the 2000 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with James Heckman. McFadden&#x27;s share of the prize was &quot;for his development of theory and methods for analyzing discrete choice&quot;. He is the Presidential Professor of Health Economics at the University of Southern California and Professor of the Graduate School at University of California, Berkeley.

==Early life and education==
McFadden was born on July 29, 1937, in Raleigh, North Carolina. He attended the University of Minnesota, where he received a B.S. in Physics, and a Ph.D. in Behavioral Science (Economics) five years later (1962). While at the University of Minnesota, his graduate advisor was Leonid Hurwicz, who was awarded the Economics Nobel Prize in 2007.

==Career==
In 1964, McFadden joined the faculty of University of California, Berkeley, focusing his research on choice behavior and the problem of linking economic theory and measurement. In 1974, he introduced conditional logit analysis.
In 1975, McFadden won the John Bates Clark Medal. In 1977, he moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1981, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

He returned to Berkeley in 1991, founding the Econometrics Laboratory, which is devoted to statistical computation for economics applications. He is a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security. He won the Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics in 2020 and was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2006.

In January 2011, McFadden was appointed the Presidential Professor of Health Economics at the University of Southern California (USC), which entails a joint appointment in the Department of Economics and the Price School of Public Policy.

==Political views==
In June 2024, 16 Nobel Prize in Economics laureates, including McFadden, signed an open letter arguing that Donald Trump’s fiscal and trade policies coupled with efforts to limit the Federal Reserve&#x27;s independence would reignite inflation in the United States.

<doc id="101175" wikidata="Q107264" url="?curid=101175" title="Robert Lucas Jr.">
<text>Robert Emerson Lucas Jr. (September 15, 1937 – May 15, 2023) was an American economist at the University of Chicago. Widely regarded as the central figure in the development of the new classical approach to macroeconomics, he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1995 &quot;for having developed and applied the hypothesis of rational expectations, and thereby having transformed macroeconomic analysis and deepened our understanding of economic policy&quot;. N. Gregory Mankiw characterized him as &quot;the most influential macroeconomist of the last quarter of the 20th century&quot;. In 2020, he ranked as the 10th most cited economist in the world.

==Early life and education==
Lucas was born on September 15, 1937, in Yakima, Washington, as the eldest child of Robert Emerson Lucas and Jane Templeton Lucas. His parents ran an ice creamery in Yakima. After the business failed during the Great Depression, the family moved to Seattle. His mother worked as a fashion designer and his father worked at shipbuilding yard and later worked as a welder with a refrigeration company.

Lucas received his BA in History in 1959 from the University of Chicago. Lucas attended the University of California, Berkeley, as a first-year graduate student, but he left Berkeley due to financial reasons and returned to Chicago in 1960, where he earned a PhD in Economics in 1964. His dissertation, &quot;Substitution Between Labor and Capital in U.S. Manufacturing: 1929–1958&quot;, was written under the supervision of H. Gregg Lewis and Dale Jorgenson. Lucas studied economics for his PhD on &quot;quasi-Marxist&quot; grounds. He believed that economics was the true driver of history, and so he planned to immerse himself fully in economics and then return to the history department.

== Career ==
Following his graduation, Lucas taught at the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now Tepper School of Business) at Carnegie Mellon University until 1975, when he returned to the University of Chicago.

Lucas was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1980, a Guggenheim Fellowship and the National Academy of Sciences in 1981, and the American Philosophical Society in 1997. A collection of his papers is housed at the Rubenstein Library at Duke University.

Lucas was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1995. The citation noted that the prize was &quot;for having developed and applied the hypothesis of rational expectations, and thereby having transformed macroeconomic analysis and deepened our understanding of economic policy&quot;.

==Research contributions==

===Rational expectations===
Lucas is well known for his investigations into the implications of rational expectations in macroeconomic theory. Lucas (1972) incorporated the idea of rational expectations into a dynamic macroeconomic models. The agents in Lucas&#x27;s model are rational: based on the available information, they form expectations about future prices and quantities, and based on these expectations they act to maximize their expected lifetime utility. He also provided sound theoretical foundations to Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps&#x27;s view of the long-run neutrality of money, and provided an explanation for the then observed correlation between output and inflation, depicted by the Phillips curve, while illustrating that the existence of this empirical relationship did not yield a possibility of a policy trade off.

===Lucas critique===

In 1976, Lucas challenged the foundations of macroeconomic theory (previously dominated by the Keynesian economics approach), arguing that a macroeconomic model should be built as an aggregated version of microeconomic models while noting that aggregation in the theoretical sense may not be possible within a given model. He formulated the &quot;Lucas critique&quot; of economic policymaking, which holds that relationships that appear to hold in the economy, such as an apparent relationship between inflation and unemployment, could change in response to changes in economic policy. The reformulation influenced the development of new classical macroeconomics and the drive towards microeconomic foundations for macroeconomic theory.

===Other contributions===
Lucas developed a theory of supply that suggests people can be tricked by unsystematic monetary policy; the Uzawa–Lucas model (with Hirofumi Uzawa) of human capital accumulation; and the &quot;Lucas paradox&quot;, which considers why more capital does not flow from developed countries to developing countries. Lucas (1988) is a seminal contribution in the economic development and growth literature. Lucas and Paul Romer heralded the birth of endogenous growth theory and the resurgence of research on economic growth in the late 1980s and the 1990s.

Lucas also contributed foundational contributions to behavioral economics, and provided the intellectual foundation for the understanding of deviations from the law of one price based on the irrationality of investors.

In 2003, he stated, about five years before the Great Recession, that the &quot;central problem of depression-prevention has been solved, for all practical purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades.&quot;

Lucas also proposed the Lucas Wedge which tries to show how much higher GDP would be in the presence of proper policy.

== Personal life ==
Lucas married an undergraduate classmate from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Rita Cohen. The couple had two sons, Stephen (born 1960) and Joseph (born 1966).

Lucas and Cohen divorced in the 1980s. The divorce stipulation had a clause that entitled Cohen to half of his Nobel prize winnings if the prize were to be awarded before October 31, 1995, which ended up being the case.

After his divorce from Cohen, Lucas married Nancy Stokey. The couple collaborated on papers on growth theory, public finance, and monetary theory.

Lucas died in Chicago on May 15, 2023, at the age of 85.

<doc id="101179" wikidata="Q3180286" url="?curid=101179" title="Prestonsburg, Kentucky">
<text>Prestonsburg is a small home rule-class city in and the county seat of Floyd County, Kentucky, United States. It is in the eastern part of the state in the valley of the Big Sandy River. The population was 3,255 at the time of the 2010 census, down from 3,612 at the 2000 census.

==History==
The area was part of the grant in the early 1700s to the family of John Preston&#x27;s wife, born Elizabeth Patton, which he administered on her behalf. The grant was intended to permit British colonization beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains, but subsequent French and Indian resistance and a reversal of British policy limited its impact. The land was not settled until John Spurlock of Montgomery County, Virginia, arrived in 1791. He laid out the town of &quot;Preston&#x27;s Station&quot; in 1797. It became the seat of Floyd County upon its formation in 1799 and was formally established in 1818. The post office was known as &quot;Floyd Court House&quot; from its establishment in 1816 until the late 1820s, when it was renamed &quot;Prestonsburg&quot;.

On January 10, 1862, nearby Middle Creek National Battlefield was the scene of the largest battle of the Civil War to occur in Eastern Kentucky. The town was also the site of one of the worst school bus disasters in American history on February 28, 1958.

The town had a pack horse library in the late 1930s to bring library materials to rural mountain residents.

==Culture==
U.S. Route 23, also called &quot;The Country Music Highway&quot; to celebrate the region&#x27;s rich heritage of music, runs through Prestonsburg. Country music stars including Loretta Lynn, Crystal Gayle, Wynonna Judd, Naomi Judd, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tom T. Hall, Ricky Skaggs, Keith Whitley, Dwight Yoakam, and Patty Loveless are all from the Big Sandy Valley.

Prestonsburg is mentioned in Dwight Yoakam&#x27;s &quot;Readin&#x27;, Rightin&#x27;, Rt. 23&quot; (from his album &quot;Hillbilly Deluxe&quot;), a song about the yearning of local coal miners to escape their plight by traveling up U.S. Route 23 to find employment in the factories in the North, not knowing that they were only trading one miserable life for another.

Prestonsburg is the location of the Mountain Arts Center, which hosts music concerts and is home to the Kentucky Opry. Middle Creek National Battlefield is the site of the largest and most significant Civil War battle in Eastern Kentucky.

Prestonsburg is home to the Samuel May House, the Big Sandy Valley&#x27;s oldest known brick home. Built by Samuel May in 1817, the house was used by the Confederate forces as a recruiting station during the American Civil War. The 5th Kentucky Infantry CSA and 10th Kentucky Cavalry were organized there. The house was used as a residence until 1981 and was donated to the City of Prestonsburg in 1992. It has since been restored and maintained as a living history museum.

The Jenny Wiley Theatre was in Prestonsburg and offered theatrical productions all year long at both the outdoor Jenny Wiley Amphitheater, in Jenny Wiley State Resort Park, and the nearby Mountain Arts Center. The Theatre&#x27;s presentations of classic Broadway musicals, comedies, historical dramas and holiday productions kept theatre-goers entertained for over 40 years.

Prestonsburg is also the home of the East Kentucky Science Center. Opened in 2004, the Science Center contains one of the nation&#x27;s most technologically advanced planetariums.

<text>The Royal Pavilion (also known as the Brighton Pavilion) and surrounding gardens is a Grade I listed former royal residence located in Brighton, England. Beginning in 1787, it was built in three stages as a seaside retreat for George, Prince of Wales, who became the Prince Regent in 1811, and King George IV in 1820. It is built in the Indo-Saracenic style prevalent in India for most of the 19th century. The current appearance, with its domes and minarets, is the work of the architect John Nash, who extended the building starting in 1815. George IV&#x27;s successors William IV and Victoria also used the Pavilion, but Queen Victoria decided that Osborne House should be the royal seaside retreat, and the Pavilion was sold to the city of Brighton in 1850.

==History==
The Prince of Wales, who later became George IV, first visited Brighton in 1783, at the age of 21. The seaside town had become fashionable as a result of the residence of George&#x27;s uncle, Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland, whose tastes for fine cuisine, gambling, the theatre, and general fast living the young prince shared, and with whom he lodged in Brighton at Grove House. In addition, the Prince of Wales was advised by his physician that the seawater and fresh air would be beneficial for his gout. In 1786, under a financial cloud with investigations by Parliament for the extravagances incurred in building Carlton House, London, the prince rented a modest, erstwhile farmhouse facing the Old Steine, a grassy area of Brighton used as a promenade by visitors. Remote from the royal court in London, the pavilion was a discreet location for the prince to enjoy private liaisons with his long-time companion, Maria Fitzherbert. The prince had wished to marry her, and did so in secrecy as her Roman Catholic religion prohibited his marrying her under the Royal Marriages Act 1772.

In 1787, the prince commissioned the designer of Carlton House, Henry Holland, to enlarge the existing building. It became one wing of the Marine Pavilion, flanking a central rotunda, which contained three main rooms: a breakfast room, dining room, and library, fitted out in Holland&#x27;s French-influenced neoclassical style, with decorative paintings by Biagio Rebecca. In 1801–02, the pavilion was enlarged with a new dining room and conservatory, to designs of Peter Frederick Robinson, who worked in Holland&#x27;s office. The Prince also purchased land surrounding the property, on which a grand riding school and stables were built in an Indian style in 1803–08, to designs by William Porden, along with a famous onion garden to feed the Prince&#x27;s well-known addiction. These provided stabling for 60 horses and dwarfed the Marine Pavilion.

Between 1815 and 1822, the designer John Nash redesigned and greatly extended the pavilion, and it is his work that is still visible today. The palace is striking in the middle of Brighton, for its unique Indo-Islamic exterior. The fanciful interior design, primarily by Frederick Crace and the little-known decorative painter Robert Jones, was heavily influenced by both Chinese and Indian fashion (with Mughal and Islamic architectural elements). The architectural design of the Royal Pavilion has drawn comparisons to the Taj Mahal due to its prominent onion domes, minarets, and Indo-Saracenic influences. While the Taj Mahal is a Mughal mausoleum built in the 17th century, the Pavilion was designed in the early 19th century by John Nash as a seaside retreat for King George IV. Despite their different historical and cultural contexts, the Pavilion&#x27;s exterior bears a visual resemblance to the iconic Indian monument, reflecting the 19th-century British fascination with South Asian architecture. It is a prime example of the exoticism that was an alternative to more classicising mainstream taste in the Regency style.

==Purchase by Brighton==
After the death of George IV in 1830, his successor William IV also stayed in the pavilion on his frequent visits to Brighton. Queen Victoria, however, disliked Brighton and the lack of privacy at the pavilion. Brighton became accessible to Londoners by rail in 1841, increasing its popularity with the masses. In addition, the pavilion was cramped for her growing family. Famously, Queen Victoria disliked the constant attention she attracted in Brighton, saying &quot;the people here are very indiscreet and troublesome&quot;.

She purchased an estate and land that was redeveloped for Osborne House in the Isle of Wight, which became the summer home of the royal family. After her last visit to Brighton in 1845, the government planned to sell the building and grounds. The Brighton Improvement Commissioners and the Brighton Vestry successfully petitioned the government to sell the Pavilion to the town for £53,000 in 1850 under the Brighton Improvement (Purchase of the Royal Pavilion and Grounds) Act 1850 (13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. v). The sale helped fund furnishing of Osborne House.

In 1860, the adjacent royal stables were converted to a concert hall, now known as the Brighton Dome. The town used the building as assembly rooms. Many of the Pavilion&#x27;s original fixtures and fittings were removed on the order of the royal household at the time of the sale, most ending up either in Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. In the late 1860s, Queen Victoria returned to Brighton large quantities of unused fittings. George V and Queen Mary returned more furnishings after the First World War.

Since the end of the Second World War, the municipality of Brighton has worked to restore the Pavilion to its state at the time of King George IV. The city was encouraged in the 1950s by the permanent loan of over 100 items of furniture from Queen Elizabeth II. It has undertaken an extensive programme of restoring the rooms, reinstating stud walls, and creating replicas of some original fittings and occasionally pieces of furniture.

In 2020, management and operation of the Royal Pavilion &amp; Museums&#x27; buildings and collections were transferred from Brighton &amp; Hove City Council to a new charity: the Royal Pavilion &amp; Museums Trust.

==First World War==

During the First World War, the Pavilion, along with other sites in Brighton, was transformed into a military hospital. From December 1914 to January 1916, sick and wounded soldiers from the Indian Army were treated in the former palace. Many Indian recipients of the Victoria Cross were treated here such as Khudadad Khan, Darwan Singh Negi, Shahamad Khan and Mir Dast. The Pavilion hospital also incorporated the adjacent Dome and Corn Exchange; these buildings had formerly been part of the large stable complex associated with the residence.

The Pavilion hospital was set up with two operating theatres and over 720 beds. Over 2,300 men from the Indian Army were treated at the hospital. Elaborate arrangements were made to cater for the patients&#x27; variety of religious and cultural needs. Nine different kitchens were set up in the grounds of the hospital, so that food could be cooked by the soldiers&#x27; fellow caste members and co-religionists. Muslim soldiers were given space on the eastern lawns to pray facing towards Mecca, while Sikh soldiers were provided with a tented gurdwara in the grounds.

The imperial government highlighted the Pavilion as showing that wounded countrymen of British India were being well treated. With the official sanction of the state, a series of photographs were made to show the resplendent rooms converted into hospital wards. The soldiers were visited by Lord Kitchener in July 1915, and King George V in August of the same year, who presented several soldiers such as Mir Dast with military honours.

The military hospital for Indian soldiers closed at the end of January 1916 after most of the British Indian Army had been withdrawn from the Western Front in France and redeployed to the Middle East.

The Pavilion reopened as a hospital in April 1916. It became a hospital for &#x27;limbless men,&#x27; treating British soldiers who had lost arms and legs, usually from amputation. In addition to treating the men&#x27;s physical needs, a great emphasis was placed on rehabilitating the men by training them in skills and trades. The Pavilion hospital operated until the summer of 1920, when the building was returned to Brighton Corporation.

A new gateway in Indian style was unveiled in 1921 by the Maharaja of Patiala to commemorate the Pavilion&#x27;s role in treating injured Indian soldiers during the war.

==Tourism==
The purchase of the Royal Pavilion from Queen Victoria, by Brighton, marked the beginnings of the site&#x27;s attraction as a tourist destination. The Royal Pavilion has been changed from a private residence to a public attraction under civic ownership. Today, around 400,000 people visit the Royal Pavilion annually. General filming and photography are permitted inside the Royal Pavilion. Many of the items in the palace are on loan, in particular from HM The King.

==Marriage venue==
The Royal Pavilion is licensed as a venue for weddings. On 29 March 2014, the Royal Pavilion was host to one of a number of the first legal same-sex marriages to take place in the United Kingdom following the passage of the 2013 Same Sex Couples Act.

==Royal Pavilion Garden==

The Royal Pavilion Garden, in the Pavilion&#x27;s grounds, has a wide variety of plants, having been restored to Nash&#x27;s original Regency vision. It is said to be the only fully restored Regency garden in the UK. The garden is maintained using only organic methods by the Trust&#x27;s garden team led by a Head gardener and including volunteers.

The garden is often used by street entertainers, especially in summer. There is also a café in the garden.

The garden is Grade II listed in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Historic England deemed the garden &#x27;at risk&#x27; in October 2017 due to its original character being blighted and overshadowed by unsightly fencing, litter bins, signage and lighting etc. Brighton and Hove City Council opened a public consultation on the future of the gardens after they were put on Historic England&#x27;s &quot;At Risk&quot; register. A list of over 20,000 crimes and anti-social behaviour incidents (including indecent sexual behaviour and drug abuse) that had taken place at the gardens had been reported to the city council in 2017, raising the possibility of fencing off the gardens and closing them at night.

<text>Camel are an English progressive rock band formed in Guildford, Surrey, in 1971. Led by guitarist Andrew Latimer, they have released fourteen studio albums and fourteen singles, plus numerous live albums and DVDs. Without achieving mass popularity, the band gained a cult following in the 1970s with albums such as &quot;Mirage&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Snow Goose&quot; (1975). They moved into a jazzier, more commercial direction in the early 1980s, but then went on an extended hiatus. Since 1991 the band has been independent, releasing albums on their own label.

Despite no new studio releases since 2002, the band performed on tour as recently as 2018. Their music has influenced artists including Marillion, Opeth and Steven Wilson. Music journalist Mark Blake described Camel as &quot;the great unsung heroes of 70s prog rock&quot;.

==History==
===1970s===

The band was formed in Guildford, Surrey, in 1971 by guitarist Andrew Latimer, drummer Andy Ward, bassist Doug Ferguson and keyboardist Peter Bardens. Latimer, Ward, and Ferguson had performed in the Guildford area as a trio named Brew, and in 1971 they auditioned to be the backing band for singer-songwriter Phillip Goodhand-Tait. The three went on to appear on latter&#x27;s album &quot;I Think I&#x27;ll Write a Song&quot;, released in September 1971. After splitting with Goodhand-Tait, the trio decided that a keyboardist would expand their sound and advertised for one in the &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Bardens responded and successfully auditioned with a Hammond organ that belonged to a mutual friend of the group. The four travelled to Ireland to fulfil outstanding contractual obligations Bardens had with his previous outfit On, after which they renamed themselves Camel. Their live debut with the name followed at Waltham Forest Technical College in London in December 1971, supporting Wishbone Ash.

The group began regular touring in January 1972, establishing themselves as a proficient live act. They soon signed with Geoff Jukes of the Buffalo Agency as their manager. By August 1972, Camel signed with MCA Records and their eponymous debut album &quot;Camel&quot; was released in early 1973. The record was not a success and the band moved to the Deram Records division of Decca Records (UK). In 1974 they released their second album, the critically acclaimed &quot;Mirage&quot;, on which Latimer showed he was also adept on flute. Although failing to chart at home, it gained success in the United States, prompting a three-month tour there.

Released in 1975, the instrumental concept album &quot;The Snow Goose&quot;, inspired by the Paul Gallico short story of the same name, was the breakthrough album that brought Camel wider attention and success. However, the album attracted a lawsuit from Gallico. It is often reported that Gallico brought the suit because he &quot;loathed smoking&quot; and thought the band were related to the cigarette brand. In reality Gallico described himself as &quot;an addict of the vice in all its blackest forms&quot; and his objection was simply on the grounds of copyright infringement. Camel accordingly added the prefix &quot;Music inspired by...&quot; to the album&#x27;s front cover and removed the story notes from the back cover. The album&#x27;s success led to a prestigious appearance at Royal Albert Hall with the London Symphony Orchestra in October 1975.

The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Moonmadness&quot; (1976), was the last to feature the original lineup. Mel Collins was added to the band on saxophone and flute for the subsequent tour. Drummer Ward was pushing for a move into jazz, which caused bassist Ferguson to quit the band in early 1977. Ferguson formed the band Headwaiter and later became a property developer.

Richard Sinclair (formerly of Caravan) replaced Ferguson, and Mel Collins joined the band in an official capacity. This lineup released &quot;Rain Dances&quot; (1977) and &quot;Breathless&quot; (1978). The latter was the last album to feature Bardens, who announced his departure before the supporting tour. He was replaced by two keyboard players both recruited from Caravan: Dave Sinclair (cousin of Richard) and Jan Schelhaas. The Sinclair cousins both left the band after the tour, replaced by keyboardist Kit Watkins and bassist Colin Bass. This lineup recorded the more commercial &quot;I Can See Your House from Here&quot; (1979); the album&#x27;s cover, photographed and designed by Gered Mankowitz, is a manipulated photographic image of a crucified astronaut looking at Earth.

===1980s===
The 1981 release &quot;Nude&quot; was a concept album based on a true story of Japanese soldier Hiroo Onoda. Duncan Mackay provided most of the keyboards in lieu of Watkins and Schelhaas, who were involved in other projects but returned for the tour. This was the first album to feature lyrics by Latimer&#x27;s future wife Susan Hoover. In mid-1981, Ward stopped playing drums due to alcohol and drug abuse and Camel quietly disbanded.

Without a band, but with a contract to fulfill and pressure from Decca for a hit song, Latimer was joined by an array of guest and session musicians at Abbey Road Studios in early 1982. The album &quot;The Single Factor&quot; was released later that year, reaching no. 57 in the UK. Another lineup featuring keyboardist Ton Scherpenzeel (of Dutch prog-rock band Kayak) and drummer Paul Burgess (ex-10cc) released the album &quot;Stationary Traveller&quot; in 1984. Camel&#x27;s contract with Decca expired in late 1984, while Latimer prevailed in a legal dispute with a former manager. Latimer moved to the United States and disbanded the group again.

===1990s===
After a seven-year hiatus, Latimer revived the Camel name in 1991 and released the album, &quot;Dust and Dreams&quot; under his own independent label Camel Productions. The album featured several players who had appeared on the group&#x27;s two previous albums in the early 1980s. Keyboardist Mickey Simmonds, who had previously backed Mike Oldfield and Fish, joined in 1992.

In the meantime, Latimer and Hoover wrote &quot;Harbour of Tears&quot; (a nickname for Cobh Harbour in Ireland from which many sailed to the United States during the Great Famine) under the Camel name, which was released in 1996. In 1999 Latimer, drummer Dave Stewart, bassist Colin Bass, and keyboardist Ton Scherpenzeel recorded &quot;Rajaz&quot;, a record inspired by an ancient Arabic poetic metre of the same name that reflects the rhythm of camel footsteps in the desert.

===2000s–2010s===

In 2001, Latimer assembled another new lineup with Bass, drummer Denis Clement, and keyboardist Guy LeBlanc. The band released the album &quot;A Nod and a Wink&quot; in 2002. The album was dedicated to former member Peter Bardens, who had died early that year, The group was inactive for much of the following decade as Latimer received treatment for myelofibrosis.

After Latimer&#x27;s recovery, Camel returned to touring in 2013, including full performances of &quot;The Snow Goose&quot;. A new and extended version of that album was released in November 2013. LeBlanc withdrew from touring in 2014 due to illness and died in 2015; he was replaced by a returning Ton Scherpenzeel.

Latimer was presented with a Lifetime Achievement award at Orange Amplification&#x27;s 2014 Progressive Music Awards, and the 2013–14 &quot;Snow Goose&quot; tour was nominated in the category of Live Event. The band continued to tour throughout the decade, and a live DVD recorded at Royal Albert Hall was released in early 2020. Latimer continues to write new music, though the band has not released a studio album since 2002.

==Musical style==
Camel have been described as a &quot;symphonic prog rock band&quot;. Predominantly instrumental, Camel&#x27;s music combines elements from rock, pop, jazz, blues, folk, classical and electronica. Though they are not from Canterbury, they have long been associated with the Canterbury scene due to their many historical connections with Caravan and other Canterbury progressive rock musicians.

==Legacy==
Camel have been acknowledged as one of the principal influences on the neo-prog subgenre which emerged in the 1980s and produced Marillion as its most successful band. Former Marillion lead singer Fish said of his first impression of the band: &quot;I thought they were a lot like Camel.&quot;

<text>Paregoric, or camphorated tincture of opium, also known as &quot;tinctura opii camphorata&quot;, is a traditional patent medicine known for its antidiarrheal, antitussive, and analgesic properties.

According to Goodman and Gilman&#x27;s 1965 edition, &quot;Paregoric is a 4% opium tincture in which there is also benzoic acid, camphor, and anise oil. ... Paregoric by tradition is used especially for children.&quot;

The term &quot;paregoric&quot; has also been used for boiled sweets which contained the substance, in particular the Army &amp; Navy brand.

==Properties==
In 1944, two clinicians who evaluated the expectorant action of paregoric, concluded:

The survival of paregoric through the centuries, and particularly through recent critical decades, is probably due to keen clinical observation and stubborn adherence to the clinical deduction that paregoric is useful in certain types of cough.

==History==
In the very early 18th century, Jakob Le Mort (1650–1718), a professor of chemistry at Leiden University, prepared an elixir for asthma and called it &quot;paregoric&quot;. The word &quot;paregoric&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;paregoricon&quot; which was originally applied to oratory – to speak, but, more accurately, talk over, soothe, and finally came to have the same meaning as &quot;anodyne&quot;.

Le Mort&#x27;s elixir, consisting of &quot;honey, licorice, flowers of Benjamin, and opium, camphor, oil of aniseed, salt of tartar and spirit of wine,&quot; was listed as &quot;Elixir Asthmaticum&quot; in the London Pharmacopoeia of 1721. Its ingredients were assembled according to the humoral theory of the time. Paregoric was used in various formulations for hundreds of years.

Paregoric was a household remedy in the 18th and 19th centuries when it was widely used to control diarrhea in adults and children, as an expectorant and cough medicine, to calm fretful children, and to rub on the gums to counteract the pain from teething.

A formula for paregoric from &quot;Dr. Chase&#x27;s Recipes&quot; (1865):
&quot;The Medical Companion, Or Family Physician&quot;, a book from 1827, gave the following recipe: 

==Use during the twentieth century==
During the twentieth century its use declined as governments regulated its ingredients (opium is a controlled substance in many countries).

Beginning in late 2011, there was a period in which paregoric was not being manufactured in the United States. , however, the manufacture of paregoric had resumed.

===Regulation===
The early twentieth century brought increased regulation of all manner of narcotics, including paregoric, as the addictive properties of opium became more widely understood, and &quot;patent medicines came under fire largely because of their mysterious compositions&quot;. In the United States, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 required that certain specified drugs, including alcohol, cocaine, heroin, morphine, and cannabis, be accurately labeled with contents and dosage. Previously many drugs had been sold as patent medicines with secret ingredients or misleading labels. Cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and other such drugs continued to be legally available without prescription as long as they were labeled. It is estimated that sale of patent medicines containing opiates decreased by 33% after labeling was mandated. In 1906 in Britain and in 1908 in Canada &quot;laws requiring disclosure of ingredients and limitation of narcotic content were instituted&quot;.

The Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 restricted the manufacture and distribution of opiates, including laudanum, and coca derivatives in the United States; this was followed by France&#x27;s &quot;Loi des stupefiants&quot; in 1916, and Britain&#x27;s Dangerous Drugs Act in 1920.

In the United States, the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 regulated &quot;opium or coca leaves, or any compound, manufacture, salt, derivative or preparation thereof&quot;, but not some medical products containing relatively low concentrations of these substances. Paregoric was classified as an &quot;Exempt Narcotic&quot;, as were other medical products containing small amounts of opium or their derivatives.

==Regulation and use since 1970==
Until 1970, paregoric could be purchased in the United States at a pharmacy without a medical prescription, in accordance with federal law. Federal law dictated that no more than two ounces of paregoric be dispensed by any pharmacy to the same purchaser within a 48-hour period. Purchasers were also required to sign a register or logbook, and pharmacies were technically required to request identification from any purchaser not personally known to the pharmacist. Some states further limited the sale of paregoric, or banned over-the-counter sales entirely. For example, Michigan law allowed over-the-counter (non-prescription) sale of paregoric until April 1964, but still allowed OTC sales of certain exempt cough medication preparations that contain 60 mg of codeine per fluid ounce.&quot; Even where legally permissible by law, OTC sale of paregoric was subject to the discretion of individual pharmacists.

In 1970, paregoric was classified as a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act (DEA #9809); however, drugs that contained a mixture of kaolin, pectin, and paregoric (e.g., Donnagel-PG, Parepectolin, and their generic equivalents) were classified as Schedule V drugs. They were available over-the-counter without a prescription in many states until the early 1990s, at which time the FDA banned the sale of anti-diarrheal drugs containing kaolin and pectin; also, Donnagel-PG contained tincture of belladonna, which became prescription-only on January 1, 1993. Paregoric is currently listed in the United States Pharmacopeia. Manufacture of the drug was discontinued for several months beginning in late 2011; however, production and distribution resumed in 2012, so the drug is still available in the United States by prescription. Thus, it is unclear as to whether the lapse in manufacture actually resulted in a shortage of the drug at any time, since prescription drugs are often still available for many months after manufacture has been discontinued. In France, paregoric was available without prescription until 1986; nowadays, it is used to wean infants born to opiate-addicted women.

==Paregoric, U.S.P. formula==
The principal active ingredient in paregoric is powdered opium. In the United States the formula for Paregoric U.S.P. is a tincture of opium 40 ml, anise oil 4 ml, benzoic acid 4 g, camphor 4 g, glycerin 40 ml, alcohol 450 ml, purified water 450 ml, diluted with alcohol to 1000 ml, and contains the equivalent of 0.4 mg/ml of anhydrous morphine; one ounce of paregoric contains 129.6 mg (2 grains) of powdered opium, or the equivalent of 13 mg of anhydrous morphine. The average adult dose is 4 ml by mouth which corresponds to 16 mg of opium, or 1.6 mg of anhydrous morphine.&quot;

It is unclear when the current formula for Paregoric, U.S.P. was developed in the United States, and more research is needed. For example, one formula for &quot;Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric Elixir)&quot; attributed to the &quot;United States Pharmacoepia of 1863&quot; is: &quot;Macerate 1 drachm each powdered opium and benzoic acid, 1 fluid drachm of anise, 2 ounces clarified honey, and 2 scruples camphor, in 2 pints diluted alcohol for 7 days, and filter through paper.&quot; A slightly different formula is given in the 1926 pharmacoepia.

The current formula for Paregoric, U.S.P. should not be assumed to be universal. For example, in the United Kingdom the formula for Paregoric, B.P. is tincture of opium 5 ml, benzoic acid 500 mg, camphor 300 mg, anise oil 0.3 ml, alcohol (60%) to 100 ml, and contains about 1/30th grain of anhydrous morphine in 60 minims, which is 25% stronger than Paregoric, U.S.P.

==Dosage==
Paregoric is sometimes confused with Laudanum, because their chemical names are similar: Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) vs. Tincture of Opium (Laudanum). However, Laudanum contains 10 milligrams of morphine per milliliter, 25 times more than Paregoric. Confusion between the two drugs has led to overdose and death in patients. Thus the term &quot;Paregoric&quot; should be used instead of &quot;Camphorated Opium Tincture&quot;, since the latter may be confused with Laudanum.
The differences between Tincture of Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) are important and should be kept in mind when administering either of these drugs. Care and caution should always be taken in administering doses of Tincture of Opium, such as the use of a dosage syringe or other suitable measurement device, and by pharmacists in preparing Paregoric from Laudanum, and to note that the dosages noted here refer to Apothecaries weight and fluid measure. In particular, &quot;the difference between a minim and a drop should be borne in mind when figuring doses. A minim is always a sixtieth part of a fluid drachm regardless of the character of the substance, while a drop varies from a forty-fifth to a two-hundred-and-fiftieth part, according to the surface tension of the fluid.&quot; Tincture of Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) each have 50.9 drops per gram; 50.0 drops per cc; 185.0 drops per fluid drachm; and 3.10 drops per minim.&quot; The importance of these distinctions is evident in view of the dangers of erroneously relying upon more general descriptions of Apothecaries&#x27; fluid measures, which typically list 60 minims per fluid dram, and 8 fluid drams per fluid ounce (480 minims).

==Indications==
The main effects of paregoric are to increase the muscular tone of the intestine, to inhibit normal peristalsis, and as an expectorant; a peer-reviewed clinical study in 1944 reported &quot;that all of [its] ingredients have been found to contribute toward the expectorant action of paregoric, and, further, that an advantage is contained in the combination over the sum of the effects of the individual constituents,&quot; that Paregoric &quot;is expectorant by virtue of a reflex from the stomach,&quot; and &quot;preparations of paregoric which have aged for two or three years are superior as an expectorant to preparations aged for less time.&quot;. Its main medical use is to control fulminant diarrhea, and as an antitussive (cough suppressant). Problems with its use include opiate dependency and analgesia which can mask symptoms of diseases that need treatment.

However, Paregoric was characterized as &quot;a needlessly complex pharmacopeial mixture... of a former day&quot; by a 1966 study. In the 21st century its two main uses have been largely supplanted by minimally psychoactive cough-suppressant drugs (such as dextromethorphan) and non-psychoactive antidiarrheal drugs (such as loperamide).

<doc id="101191" wikidata="Q23914245" url="?curid=101191" title="Incident on 57th Street">
<text>&quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; is a song written by Bruce Springsteen that was first released on his 1973 album &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot;. It has been described by critics as a key development in Springsteen&#x27;s songwriting career and regarded by fans as one of his greatest songs. 

==Writing and recording==
&quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; was the last song Springsteen recorded for &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot;. As with the rest of the album, it was recorded at 914 Sound Studios in Blauvelt, New York. Springsteen had been working on it under the working title &quot;Puerto Rican Jane.&quot; It was one of the first songs on which Springsteen felt like an &quot;observer,&quot; writing whatever came out of him rather than self-consciously trying to write something specific. On the album, the piano solo at the end of the song segues directly into the guitar opening of the following song, &quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight).&quot;

==Lyrics and music==
According to Springsteen, the theme of &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; is &quot;redemption,&quot; a theme he would return to again many times. The story is set in New York City and tells the story of &quot;Spanish Johnny&quot; and &quot;Puerto Rican Jane.&quot; It has parallels to Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;West Side Story&quot; in telling a &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;-like story with Latin American characters set in New York. Johnny is explicitly referred to as &quot;a cool Romeo&quot; and Jane as &quot;a late Juliet.

Johnny comes to midtown Manhattan after getting beat up while trying to work as a male escort. Although rejected by everyone else, he finds redemption when Jane sympathizes with him, saying &quot;Johnny don&#x27;t cry.&quot; They sleep together, but when his old companions call to him asking him to join them in making &quot;some easy money,&quot; he leaves Jane to join them. Jane tells him that &quot;you can leave me tonight but just don&#x27;t leave me alone.&quot; Johnny agrees to return to her tomorrow, although he doesn&#x27;t actually know if he will be able to, telling her that &quot;We may find it out on the street tonight, baby/Or we may walk until the daylight maybe.&quot; Springsteen leaves the ending ambiguous, leaving to the listener&#x27;s imagination whether Johnny&#x27;s adventure that night meets with a tragic end, or whether the lovers actually do get away.

The music starts quietly, with David Sancious on piano with some support from Springsteen on guitar. The song proceeds at a moderate tempo, supported by what music writer Jim Beviglia describes as &quot;hiccuping&quot; from Vini Lopez&#x27; drumming. But upon Jane&#x27;s line of &quot;Johnny don&#x27;t cry,&quot; the music becomes more lively, with Danny Federici&#x27;s organ taking prominence. After Johnny wakes up from their night of lovemaking, the music dies down again to a solo bass guitar part by Garry Tallent. There are three statements of the line &quot;We may find it out on the street tonight, baby/Or we may walk until the daylight maybe&quot; at the end of the song. Beviglia describes the first as &quot;a whisper,&quot; the second as being &quot;more assertive&quot; and the last as &quot;a maelstrom of sound&quot; as Springsteen sings &quot;with majestic desperation as the band crashes all around him.&quot; Finally, the song ends with Sancious again on solo piano, which Beviglia interprets as depicting Jane waiting for Johnny to return. The song&#x27;s harmonies are based primarily on tonic, dominant and subdominant, and the subdominant is often played with a major seventh chord.

As with many of Springsteen&#x27;s early songs, &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; has a complex, extended structure. There are three verses, each in three parts, although the second verse skips the second part. The refrain appears after the first verse, but is skipped at the end of the second verse. At the point at which the second refrain is expected, the music slows down to the solo bass part leading directly to the third verse. After the third verse, a suspended chord on Federici&#x27;s organ generates a return of the refrain, which is then repeated three additional times as the intensity builds. On the album, after slowing and quieting down to Sancious&#x27; ending solo piano part, the music segues into the driving guitars of &quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight).&quot;

==Reception==
Music writer Patrick Humphries describes &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; as &quot;the moment when Springsteen the writer came into his own.&quot; Music critic Clinton Heylin called it &quot;an early masterpiece, it is the kinda epic song [Springsteen] has spent his youth imagining and the [previous] 18 months working towards. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Dave Marsh calls it one of the &quot;few precious moments in rock when you can hear a musician overcoming both his own limits and the restrictions of the form.&quot; Beviglia calls it &quot;the bridge from the 1973 Bruce to the one who has been near or atop the rock-and-roll world for about 40 years now. He goes on to say that &quot;Incident&quot; was a critical step towards Springsteen&#x27;s being able to create &quot;Born to Run&quot;, calling it a &quot;dry run that came out perfect.&quot;

In 2014, Beviglia rated &quot;Incident on 57th Street as Springsteen&#x27;s 3rd greatest song. In 2013, a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; panel rated it Springsteen&#x27;s 17th greatest song.

Humphries sees an influence from &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; on the structure of Dire Straits&#x27; 1980 song &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; viewed it as a precursor to the &quot;expansive urban storytelling&quot; of Springsteen&#x27;s 1975 classic song &quot;Jungleland.&quot; According to Springsteen&#x27;s saxophone player Clarence Clemons, the introduction to &quot;Jungleland&quot; evolved from the piano and violin introduction to the version of &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; that Springsteen had been playing live. Springsteen himself has suggested that the lyrics of &quot;Jungleland&quot; may tell what happened after &quot;Incident on 57th Street,&quot; with Johnny becoming &quot;Jungleland&quot;&#x27;s Magic Rat.

==Other appearances==
The first live performance of &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; occurred on January 23, 1974, at Muther&#x27;s Music Emporium in Nashville, Tennessee. In live performances Springsteen rarely performed it directly before &quot;Rosalita&quot; as it is sequenced on the album. &quot;Incident&quot; was one of several songs for which Springsteen hired violinist Suki Lahav to join the E Street Band for live performances in 1974 and 1975. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; had fallen to only occasional inclusion in live set lists.

A 10-minute live version of &quot;Incident on 57th Street,&quot; recorded at the Nassau Coliseum on December 28, 1980, was released on the 1987 EP &quot;Live Collection&quot;. The live performance was also released as the B-side of Springsteen&#x27;s release of the 12&quot; single &quot;War&quot; in Europe in 1986; despite its exceptional length, it also appeared as the B-side of the US release of the &quot;Fire&quot; 7&quot; single. Another live performance was included on the 2003 video &quot;Live in Barcelona&quot;, with Springsteen on solo piano.

<text>&quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&quot; is a 1973 song by Bruce Springsteen, from his &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot; album, and is especially famed as a concert number for Springsteen and The E Street Band. The song, which clocks in at just over seven minutes, is a story of forbidden love between the singer and the eponymous Rosalita, whose parents disapprove of his life in a rock and roll band. It is included on the compilation albums &quot;The Essential Bruce Springsteen&quot; and &quot;Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band Greatest Hits&quot;. In 2021, Rolling Stone ranked it the 446th greatest song of all time on their updated 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.

==Reception==
Never released as a single in U.S. and generally unknown upon its initial album release, &quot;Rosalita&quot; began to get FM radio airplay when an advance version of &quot;Born to Run&quot; was distributed to rock radio stations. As Springsteen gained commercial success, &quot;Rosalita&quot; became one of his most popular airplay tracks, and is still heard on classic rock radio. The song, despite never receiving an official US single release, has been lauded hugely by music critics in the years since its release in 1973. On its release Ken Emerson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; dubbed it &quot;a raucous celebration of desire.&quot; In &quot;Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau described it as &quot;more lyrical and ironic than you could have dreamed&quot;. George P Pelecanos of &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine has called it &quot;One of the great rock&#x27;n roll performances, and as close to a perfect song as anyone&#x27;s ever recorded,&quot; while Chris T-T in the same publication declared &quot;Never mind The Beatles or The Rolling Stones, this is the best rock&#x27;n roll track of all time.&quot; The song is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. Its music video occupies the number 71 spot on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 1993 list of the top 100 videos.

Though it was not released as a single in the US (or anywhere at the time of the album&#x27;s release), &quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&quot; was released as a single in the Netherlands and some other European countries in 1979.

==Music video==
In 1984, many years after the song&#x27;s initial release, MTV began showing a music video for the song. The video was a straight concert performance (from a Darkness Tour performance on July 8, 1978, at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix, Arizona) that included band introductions and female fans rushing the stage.

In 1979, a live concert performance was shown on the BBC2 television show &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;. This performance was later released on a compilation DVD of performances from the show.

==Live performances==
For many years, dating back virtually to when the song was written, &quot;Rosalita&quot; always closed the regular set in Springsteen concerts, often elongated to incorporate extended band introductions. It was the one &quot;sure thing&quot; in a Springsteen set list and celebrated as such. Steven Van Zandt used this time to shine on backing vocals, as his voice changed on performances of the song from the Born to Run tours to The River Tour and during the River Tour on November 2, 1980, Springsteen changed the lyrics to &quot;Rosie, relax and let&#x27;s have a little fun cause Rosie, my record just went to number one&quot; celebrating the fact that Springsteen just had his first &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one album.

On October 19, 1984, in the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington, during the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, &quot;Rosalita&quot; was dropped from the show, not to reappear. Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh said this was done to &quot;disrupt the ritual expectations of the fanatic fans [...] establishing through a burst of creativity just who &quot;was&quot; boss [...] he&#x27;d liberated the show from an albatross, a song that was too long and had long since stopped breathing.&quot;
For many years, &quot;Rosalita&quot; made only rare or sporadic appearances, leading to fans campaigning for the song to be played by holding banners or placards saying &quot;Let Rosie Come Out Tonight!&quot; during shows. Springsteen occasionally granted the wish, though, such as during the last show of the above-mentioned tour in 1985 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, or on most of the quick American leg of the 1988 Tunnel of Love Express (it was dropped before the end, and did not appear on the European leg), or on the last night of a 15-show stand at the Continental Airlines Arena in New Jersey on the Reunion Tour in 1999. Finally, during the U.S. outdoor stadium portion of The Rising Tour in Summer 2003, &quot;Rosalita&quot; was inserted into the encores and was played in all 33 of those shows.

During the 2007–2008 Magic Tour, the song made sporadic appearances, sometimes in reaction to audience signs requesting it. On the July 4 show in Gothenburg, Van Zandt brought back the famous &quot;double-mike&quot; ditty he and Springsteen used to do in the 1970s with the song&#x27;s chorus. &quot;Rosalita&quot; continued to make sporadic appearances as the final encore during the 2009 Working on a Dream Tour. Beginning with the Wrecking Ball tour, the song became a regular part of encores.

<text>A  ( , , ) is a district of Ireland, either individually or collectively, where the Irish government recognises that the Irish language is the predominant vernacular, or language of the home.
The districts were first officially recognised during the 1920s in the early years of the Irish Free State, following the Gaelic revival, as part of a government policy aimed at restoring the Irish language.

The is threatened by serious language decline. Research published in 2015 showed that Irish is spoken on a daily basis by two-thirds or more of the population in only 21 of the 155 electoral divisions in the . Daily language use by two-thirds or more of the population is regarded by some academics as a tipping point for language survival.

==History==

In 1926, the official was designated as a result of the report of the first Gaeltacht Commission &quot;Coimisiún na Gaeltachta&quot;. The exact boundaries were not defined. At the time, an area was classified as if 80% or more of the population was Irish-speaking; however, partial- status was also accorded to many areas that did not meet the threshold, so long as they were at least 25% Irish-speaking. The Irish Free State recognised that there were predominantly Irish-speaking or semi-Irish-speaking districts in 7 of its 26 counties, covering 22 districts.

In the 1950s, another Commission concluded that the boundaries were ill-defined. It recommended that status be based solely on the strength of language use in an area.

In 1956, under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1956, the position of Minister for the Gaeltacht (now the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media) was created. The same legislation allowed the government to designate areas as being districts. They were initially defined precisely and excluded many areas in which the number of Irish speakers had declined. areas were recognised in seven of the state&#x27;s 26 counties (nominally Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Kerry, and Waterford).

Since then, the boundaries have been maintained with minor changes: the inclusion of An Clochán (&quot;Cloghane&quot;) and Cé Bhréanainn (&quot;Brandon&quot;) in County Kerry in 1974; the inclusion of a part of West Muskerry in County Cork (although the Irish-speaking population had decreased markedly from what it had been before the 1950s); and the inclusion of Baile Ghib (&quot;Gibstown)&quot; and Ráth Chairn (&quot;Rathcarran&quot;) in County Meath in 1967.

==21st century==
A study in 2005 by the Educational Council for Gaeltacht and Irish-Medium Schools, said that Gaeltacht schools were facing a crisis. It forecast that, without support, few of them would be teaching in Irish in 20 years&#x27; time. This would threaten the future of the Gaeltacht. Parents felt that the educational system did not support their efforts to pass on Irish as a living language to their children. The study added that a significant number of Gaeltacht schools had switched to teaching in English, and others were wavering.

In 2002 the third &quot;Coimisiún na Gaeltachta&quot; stated in its report that the erosion of the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht was now such that it was only a matter of time before the Gaeltacht disappeared. In some areas, Irish had already ceased to be a community language. Even in the strongest Gaeltacht areas, current patterns of bilingualism were leading to the dominance of English. Policies implemented by the State and voluntary groups were having no effect.

The report recommended that a new language reinforcement strategy was required, one that had the confidence of the community itself. The Commission recommended, among many other things, that the boundaries of the official Gaeltacht should be redrawn. It also recommended a comprehensive linguistic study to assess the vitality of the Irish language in the remaining Gaeltacht districts.

The study was undertaken by &quot;Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge&quot; (part of the National University of Ireland, Galway). On 1 November 2007 &quot;Staidéar Cuimsitheach Teangeolaíoch ar Úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht&quot; (&quot;A Comprehensive Linguistic Study of the Usage of Irish in the Gaeltacht&quot;) was published.

Concerning Gaeltacht boundaries, it suggested creating three linguistic zones within the Gaeltacht region:
* A – more than 67% daily Irish speaking – Irish dominant as the community language
* B – 44%–66% daily Irish speaking – English dominant, with large Irish-speaking minority
* C – less than 44% daily Irish speaking – English dominant, but with Irish-speaking minority much higher than the national average of Irish speaking

The report suggested that Category A districts should be the State&#x27;s priority in providing services through Irish and development schemes. It also said that Category C areas that showed a further decline in the use of Irish should lose their Gaeltacht status.

The 2006 Census data shows that of the 95,000 people living within the official Gaeltacht, approximately 17,000 belonged to Category A areas, 10,000 to Category B, and 17,000 to Category C, leaving about 50,000 in Gaeltacht areas that did not meet the minimum criteria. In response to this situation, the government introduced the Gaeltacht Bill 2012. Its stated aim was to provide for a new definition of boundaries based on language criteria, but it was criticised for doing the opposite of this.

Critics drew attention to Section 7 of the Bill, which stated that all areas &quot;currently within the Gaeltacht&quot; would maintain their current Gaeltacht status, regardless of whether Irish was used. This status could only be revoked if the area failed to prepare a language plan (with no necessary relationship to the documented number of speakers). The Bill was also criticised for placing all responsibility for the maintenance of Irish on voluntary organisations, with no increase in government resources.

The annual report in 2012 by the Language Commissioner for Irish reinforced these criticisms by emphasising the failure of the State to provide Irish-language services to Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht and elsewhere. The report said that Irish in the Gaeltacht was now at its most fragile and that the State could not expect that Irish would survive as a community language if the State kept forcing the use of English on Gaeltacht communities.

A report published in 2015, &quot;Nuashonrú ar an Staidéar Cuimsitheach Teangeolaíoch ar Úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht: 2006–2011&quot;, said that on present indicators, Irish will cease to be used as a community language in the Gaeltacht within ten years. By the time of the 2022 census, the number of speakers using the language daily had declined to 20,261. The recent decline is in part attributed to the housing crisis, as young people who grew up within the Gaeltacht are unable to afford homes in the area and leave.

==Administration==

The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, under the leadership of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, is responsible for the overall Irish Government policy with respect to the Gaeltacht, and supervises the work of the &quot;Údarás na Gaeltachta&quot; and other bodies. &quot;RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta&quot; is the (RTÉ) radio station serving the Gaeltacht and Irish speakers generally. TG4 is the television station which is focused on promoting the Irish language and is based in the County Galway Gaeltacht.

In March 2005, Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs Éamon Ó Cuív announced that the government of Ireland would begin listing only the Irish language versions of place names in the Gaeltachtaí as the official names, stripping the official Ordnance Survey of their English equivalents, to bring them up to date with road signs in the Gaeltacht, which have been in Irish only since 1970. This was done under a Placenames Order made under the Official Languages Act.

==Gaeltachtaí in the Republic of Ireland==

===Demographics===
The 2022 census of the Republic of Ireland showed that the population of the Gaeltacht was 102,973, 2% of the total population; this figure represented an increase of 2% from 2016. 65,156 (66%) of the Gaeltacht population were Irish speakers. As of the 2022 census, English is the family and community language in the majority of the 156 Electoral Divisions of the Gaeltacht.
The Gaeltacht districts have historically suffered from mass emigration. Being at the edge of the island they always had fewer railways and roads, and poorer land to farm. Other influences have been the arrival of non-Irish speaking families, the marginal role of the Irish language in the education system and general pressure from the English-speaking community. There is no evidence that periods of relative prosperity have materially improved the situation of the language.

===Donegal Gaeltacht===
The Donegal (or Tyrconnell) Gaeltacht ( or &quot;Gaeltacht Thír Chonaill&quot;) has a population of 23,346 (Census 2016) and represents 23.4% of the total Gaeltacht population. The Donegal Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of . This represents 26% of total Gaeltacht land area. The three parishes of the Rosses, Gweedore and Cloughaneely constitute the main centre of population of the Donegal Gaeltacht. There are over 17,132 Irish speakers, 14,500 in areas where it is spoken by 30–100% of the population and 2,500 in areas where it is spoken by less than 30%. In 2006 there were 2,436 people employed in a full-time capacity in Údarás na Gaeltachta client companies in the Donegal Gaeltacht. This region is particularly popular with students of the Ulster dialect; each year thousands of students visit the area from Northern Ireland. Donegal is unique in the Gaeltacht regions, as its accent and dialect is unmistakably northern in character. The language has many similarities with Scottish Gaelic, which are not evident in other Irish dialects.

Gweedore in County Donegal is the largest Gaeltacht parish in Ireland, which is home to regional studios of &quot;RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta&quot;. It has produced well-known traditional musicians, including the bands Altan and Clannad, as well as the artist Enya. All three have recorded music in Irish.

===Galway Gaeltacht===
The Galway County () and Galway City () Gaeltachtaí have a combined population of 50,570 (2016) and represent 50.8% of total Gaeltacht population. The Galway Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of . This represents 26% of total Gaeltacht land area.

There is also a third-level constituent college of National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) called Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge in An Cheathrú Rua and Carna. The national Irish-language radio station Raidió na Gaeltachta is located in Casla, the &quot;Tuairisc&quot; online newspaper is in Barna, and the national television station TG4 is in Baile na hAbhann. Galway city is home to the Irish language theatre Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe.

===Kerry Gaeltacht===
The Kerry Gaeltacht () consists of two areas – the western half of Gaeltacht Corca Dhuibhne (&quot;Dingle Peninsula&quot;) and central and western parts of Iveragh Peninsula (&quot;Uíbh Ráthach&quot;). The largest settlement in Corca Dhuibhne is Dingle and the largest in Iveragh Peninsula is Ballinskelligs. The Kerry Gaeltacht has a population of 8,729 (6,185 Irish speakers) and represents 9% of total Gaeltacht population. The Kerry Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of .

===Mayo Gaeltacht===
The Mayo Gaeltacht () as of 2011 has a total population of 10,886 and represents 11.5% of the total Gaeltacht population. The Mayo Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of . This represents 19% of the total Gaeltacht land area and comprises three distinct areas – Erris, Achill Island and Toormakeady. There are 6,667 Irish speakers, with 4,000 living in areas where the language is spoken by 30–100% of the population and 2,500 living in areas where it is spoken by less than 30%.

===Cork Gaeltacht===

The Cork Gaeltacht () consists of two areas – Muskerry and Cape Clear Island. The Muskerry Gaeltacht has a population of 3,895 people (2,951 Irish speakers) and represents 4% of the total Gaeltacht population. The Cork Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of . This represents 6% of the total Gaeltacht area. The largest Muskerry settlements are the villages of Baile Mhic Íre (Ballymakeera), Baile Bhuirne (Ballyvourney), Cill na Martra (Kilnamartyra), and Béal Átha an Ghaorthaidh (Ballingeary).

===Waterford Gaeltacht===
The Waterford Gaeltacht (Gaeltacht na nDéise, ) is ten kilometres (six miles) west of Dungarvan. It embraces the parishes of Rinn Ua gCuanach (Ring) and An Sean Phobal (Old Parish). The Waterford Gaeltacht has a population of 1,784 people (1,271 Irish speakers) and represents 2% of total Gaeltacht population.

All education in Gaeltacht na nDéise is carried out through the medium of Irish. There are two Pre-schools, two Primary level national schools, one Secondary School, Meánscoil San Nioclás and Coláiste na Rinne, a private boarding school and summer college. 

===Meath Gaeltacht===
The Meath Gaeltacht () is the smallest Gaeltacht area and consists of the two villages of Ráth Cairn and Baile Ghib. Navan, from Baile Ghib, is the main urban centre within the region, with a population of more than 20,000. The Meath Gaeltacht has a population of 1,771 and represents 2% of the total Gaeltacht population. The Meath Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of . This represents 1% of the total Gaeltacht land area.

The Meath Gaeltacht has a history quite different from that of the country&#x27;s other Irish speaking regions. The Ráth Cairn Gaeltacht was founded in 1935 when 41 families from Connemara in West Galway were resettled on land previously acquired by the Irish Land Commission. Each was given to farm. Baile Ghib (formerly Gibbstown) was settled in the same way in 1937, along with Baile Ailin (formerly Allenstown). In the early years, a large percentage of the population returned to Galway or emigrated, but enough Irish speakers remained to ensure that Ráth Cairn and Baile Ghib were awarded Gaeltacht status in 1967. The original aim of spreading the Irish language into the local community met with no success, and the colonists had to become bilingual.

==Revival and innovation==

There are areas of Ireland, north and south, where an attempt is being made to re-establish Irish-speaking communities, with varying levels of success. Such areas are both urban and rural. Most daily speakers of Irish now live outside the existing Gaeltacht areas, and are particularly numerous in Dublin. In 2018 Foras na Gaeilge announced that Carn Tóchair in County Londonderry was going to be one of the first five Líonraí Gaeilge (areas with Irish-speaking networks) on the island of Ireland, along with Belfast, Loughrea in County Galway, Ennis in County Clare, and Clondalkin in Dublin.

===Dublin===
Dublin and its suburbs are reported to be the site of the largest number of daily Irish speakers, with 14,229 persons speaking Irish daily, representing 18 per cent of all daily speakers. In a survey of a small sample of adults who had grown up in Dublin and had completed full-time education, 54% of respondents reported some fluency in Irish, ranging from being able to make small talk to complete fluency. Only 19% of speakers spoke Irish three or more times per week, with a plurality (43%) speaking Irish less than once a fortnight.

There is an Irish-language centre &quot;Áras Chrónáin&quot; in Clondalkin and an Irish language GAA club Na Gaeil Óga CLG based in Lucan and the Phoenix Park.

County Dublin has over 50 Gaelscoileanna including 10 Gaelcholáistí.

===Northern Ireland===
In 2001, the British government ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Irish (in Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, giving it a status comparable to that of the Welsh language or Scottish Gaelic. This included undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters. Compliance with the state&#x27;s obligations is assessed periodically by a Committee of Experts of the Council of Europe.

A language revival has also taken place in southern County Londonderry, centred on Slaghtneill (Sleacht Néill) and Carntogher (Carn Tóchair), both outside Maghera.

In 2022 the British Parliament passed the Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Act 2022, which made Irish alongside English as the two official languages of Northern Ireland, it also repealed the 1737 ban of Irish in Northern Irish courts. In January of 2024 Irish was spoken for the first time in a Belfast court since the repeal of the act. This is the first time in nearly 300 years.

===West Clare===
Parts of County Clare were recognised as Gaeltacht areas following recommendations made by Coimisiún na Gaeltachta 1925. In 1956, however, it was decided that there were too few traditional speakers to justify the inclusion of Clare in the Official Gaeltacht. Since then there have been attempts to re-establish the language in the community, and it was claimed in 2012 that there were up to 170 people in County Clare who were daily speakers of Irish. The main activist group is Coiste Forbartha Gaeltachta Chontae an Chláir (The Gaeltacht Development Committee for County Clare), whose aim is to achieve Gaeltacht status for County Clare or for part of it.

===North America===
The Permanent North American Gaeltacht is an area in Tamworth, Ontario in Canada. It has no permanent residents but serves as a resource centre for Irish speakers throughout North America. It was officially opened in 2007.

==Irish colleges==
Irish colleges are residential Irish language summer courses that give students the opportunity to be totally immersed in the language, usually for periods of three weeks over the summer months. During these courses, students attend classes and participate in a variety of different activities games, music, art and sport. There are a number of different Irish colleges for students to choose from throughout the country. Many of the colleges while providing a number of activities and events for young people through the Irish language will be known for or specialise in a specific category. For example, Coláiste Lurgan is commonly known for its promotion of the Irish language through music, Coláiste Aodáin for water sports and team games, and others for GAA sports.

As with the conventional schools, the Department of Education sets out requirements for class sizes and qualifications required by teachers. Some courses are college-based and others provide for residence with host families in Gaeltacht areas, such as Ros Muc in Galway, Ráth Cairn in County Meath, and Teileann and Rann na Feirste in County Donegal, with instruction given by a &quot;bean an tí&quot;, or Irish-speaking landlady.
Popular Irish colleges/Gaeltachts include: Spleodar, Colaiste Sheosaimh and Uisce. Most Irish language summer colleges for teenagers in the Gaeltacht are supported and represented by CONCOS, who are based in Leitir Móir.

<text>Munda is the largest settlement on the island of New Georgia in the Western Province of Solomon Islands, and consists of a number of villages. It is located at the southwestern tip (called Munda Point) of the western end of New Georgia, and the large Roviana Lagoon is just offshore.

Munda Point was originally the site of a coconut plantation established by Englishman Norman Wheatley, and then owned by Australian Lesley Gill.

==History==
The Colonial Office had appointed Charles Morris Woodford as the Resident Commissioner in the Solomon Islands on 17 February 1897. He was directed to control the labour trade operating in the Solomon Island waters and to stop the illegal trade in firearms. Arthur Mahaffy was appointed as the Deputy Commissioner to Woodford in January 1898. In January 1900, Mahaffy established a government station at Gizo, as Woodford considered Mahaffy’s military training as making him suitable for the role of suppressing headhunting in New Georgia and neighbouring islands. Mahaffy had a force of twenty-five police armed with rifles. The first target of this force was chief Ingava of the Roviana Lagoon who had been raiding Choiseul and Isabel and killing or enslaves hundreds of people.

Mahaffy and the police officers under his command carried out a violent and ruthless suppression of headhunting, with his actions having the support of Woodford and the Western Pacific High Commission, who wanted to eradicate headhunting and complete a “pacification” of the western Solomon Islands. Mahaffy seized and destroyed large war canoes (&quot;tomokos&quot;). One of which was used to transport the police officers.

The Methodist Mission in the Western Province was established by Rev. John Frances Goldie in 1902. He dominated the mission and gained the loyalty of Solomon Islander members of his church. The relationship with the colonial administrators of the British Solomon Island Protectorate were also fraught with difficulty, at this time due to Goldie&#x27;s effective control over the Western Solomon Islands. From 1927 to 1934 Dr Edward Sayers worked at the Methodist mission where he established a hospital at Munda and also at Gizo and Vella Lavella, and carried out fieldwork in the treatment of malaria.

In November 1942, during World War II, the town became strategically important after Japanese forces built an airstrip (on the site of today&#x27;s Munda Airport) to support Japanese forces fighting the Battle of Guadalcanal. A Japanese convoy put into Munda Point on 24 November 1942, and started construction under careful concealment from the air by means of rows of coconut palms suspended by cable. The airstrip was discovered by American planes on 3 December, and the first airstrikes were delivered by B-17 Flying Fortress bombers on 9 December. However, the Japanese were able to use Munda despite regular bombardment from both air and sea, and the Allies launched Operation Cartwheel in order to drive the Japanese out of the Solomons and ultimately eliminate the large Japanese base at Rabaul. The New Georgia Campaign was launched in late June, 1943 when mainly American but also Pacific Islander troops conducted the Landings on Rendova and several other amphibious operations throughout the New Georgia Group. 
The Allied forces spent July 1943 conducting the Drive on Munda Point, shelling and bombing Japanese forces in and around Munda Airfield, fighting off a large Japanese counterattack, and eventually closing in on Munda overland, capturing it on 4–5 August during the Battle of Munda Point. The heavy fighting left thousands dead on both sides and many more wounded.

==Transport==
Boats are the main method of coastal and inter-island transport. 
The airstrip from World War II was later converted into Munda Airport and is used commercially for daily flights land from Honiara, Setghe and Gizo, including services on Solomon Airlines.

==Geography==
Lambete, the largest village in Munda, today consists of a number of shops, a branch of the Bank of South Pacific (BSP), a post office, a telecommunications centre, a bakery, accommodations, the airstrip and a small port.

<text>In Hinduism, in the Devi Mahatmya, Chanda and Munda are asuras (demons) in the service of demons Shumbha and Nishumbha. One day, they set their eyes upon Parvati and were overwhelmed by her beauty. They carried reports of this goddess to Shumbha. Shumbha desired to marry her. After the death of his lieutenant Dhumralochana at the hands of Devi, Shumbha sent Chanda and Munda to fight her, with orders to bring her to him by force. After Chanda and Munda approached the Devi, she turned black and Kali sprung from her forehead and killed them. Then, since she had slain Chanda and Munda, the Devi gave the name &quot;Chamunda&quot; to Kali. Afterwards, the demon Raktabīja was sent by the demons, but was also slain by Goddess Kali.

According to Skanda Purana Purana, Chanda and Munda also worshipped Surya.

<text>Pieter Cornelis Martijn van den Hoogenband (; born 14 March 1978) is a Dutch retired swimmer. He is a triple Olympic champion and former world record holder.

==Early life==
Born in Maastricht, Limburg, he is the son of Cees-Rein van den Hoogenband and Astrid Verver, a former Dutch 800 m freestyle silver medalist at the European Junior Championships. He has a younger brother.

He grew up in Geldrop, where he swam for PSV Eindhoven. His father, a former judoka, was a team doctor with the professional football team of the same club.

Russian swimmer and four-time Olympic gold medalist Alexander Popov was his role model.

==Swimming career==
===Early career===
In 1993, Van den Hoogenband achieved his first success, performing well on the European Youth Olympic Days. Before the Atlanta Games, Astrid van den Hoogenband, who was coaching the Dutch team, became frustrated with the swimmers representing the Netherlands, feeling they had much potential but would not be able to live up to it due to lack of adequate support. She pleaded with Cees to take action, as he carried much weight from his professional connections. After Astrid threatened to remove Pieter from the sport, Cees created a small foundation and signed up 20 initial sponsors who each paid $2,500 to fund a team trainer. The Dutch swimming team eventually signed contracts with Philips, Nike, and Speedo. Enough funds were raised to open a swim school in Eindhoven, Van den Hoogenband&#x27;s place of residence. The team eventually grew to ten. Pieter remained the Netherlands&#x27; brightest star, and along with fellow Dutch Inge de Bruijn brought the Netherlands many victories in the sport. 

Van den Hoogenband is the only swimmer in history who has managed to win both the 100–200 metre freestyle double at the Olympics and also repeat as 100 freestyle champion at the Olympics. His three Olympic gold are the only three won by a Dutch male pool swimmer.

====1996 Olympics====
Van den Hoogenband&#x27;s international breakthrough came at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Only 18 years old, he exceeded the expectations of many by finishing 4th in both the 100 m and 200 m freestyle. He won the 50 m freestyle B final, and finished 5th in the 4×100 m freestyle relay, 7th in the 4×200 m freestyle relay, and 10th in the 4×100 m medley relay.

===Later career===

====1998 World championships====
At the 1998 World Aquatics Championships in Perth, Australia, Van den Hoogenband won bronze medal in the 200 metre freestyle and silver in the 4×200 m freestyle relay.

====2000 Olympics====
After winning 6 gold medals at the 1999 European Championships, Van den Hoogenband was one of the favourites at the 2000 Summer Olympics, but his adversaries were formidable. In the 200 m freestyle he faced the world record holder, Australian youngster Ian Thorpe, favourite of the home crowd in Sydney. In the semi-finals, Van den Hoogenband set a new world record, but Thorpe countered with a time only 0.02 s slower. In an exciting final, Van den Hoogenband equalled his time from the semi-finals to win the gold medal. In the 100 m freestyle, Van den Hoogenband again set a world record in the semi-finals and won his second gold medal, defeating the 1992 and 1996 champion, Alexander Popov. His 100 m world record stood until 21 March 2008 and was broken by France&#x27;s Alain Bernard (47.60). Van den Hoogenband won two more medals, both bronze, in the 50 m freestyle and the 4×200 m freestyle relay, in which he was the final swimmer.

Van den Hoogenband was named Dutch sportsman of the year in 1999, 2000 and 2004, World Swimmer of the Year in 2000, and European Swimmer of the Year in 1999, 2000, 2002 and 2004.

====2001 World championships====
At the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Van den Hoogenband won four silver medals in the 50 m, 100 m, 200 m freestyle events and 4×100 m freestyle relay.

====2003 World Championships====
At the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona he split a 46.70 in the medley relay which stood as the fastest 100 m freestyle split until it was topped in 2008 by the French relay veteran Frédérick Bousquet, at 46.63 seconds. Van den Hoogenbands&#x27; 46.70, however, remained as the fastest textile relay split until it was topped in 2015 by Cameron McEvoy of Australia. He had disappointing performances in both the 100 and 200 freestyle events though, finishing runner up to Alexander Popov and Ian Thorpe respectively, with considerably slow times. His times from previous meets in the past year, and earlier rounds of the championships, would have won both events. His winning time in the 200 freestyle at the 2002 European Championships was faster than Ian Thorpe&#x27;s winning time at these Championships, but Pieter went about 2 whole seconds slower this time around. His time in the semis of the 100 freestyle at these Championships would have won the final of that event as well (won by Alexander Popov), and his 100 free relay split (with nearly a second gain from a rolling start) was 2 whole seconds faster.

====2004 Olympics====
At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, he won a gold medal in the 100 m freestyle and two silvers in the 200 m freestyle and the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, swimming the anchor leg in 46.79 which was the 2nd fastest split in history. By finishing ahead of Michael Phelps in both the 200 m freestyle and the 4×100 m freestyle relay, he is the only swimmer to ever beat Phelps twice in Olympic competition. While technically the second was a relay, his split was faster by a large margin, and the margin of beating the U.S. team by a far smaller one.

====2007 World Championships====
At the 2007 World Championships in Melbourne, Australia, Van den Hoogenband won a silver medal in the 200 m freestyle behind Michael Phelps.

He holds by a large margin the all-time record for most runner up finishes at the World Championships without winning.

====2008 Olympics====
Van den Hoogenband returned to the Olympic Games in 2008 in Beijing and finished fifth in the 100 m freestyle. He retired after the race. In the semifinals he broke his own national record that stood from the 2000 Summer Olympics, bringing it to 47.68 s.

In making the 100 m freestyle final, Van den Hoogenband became the first swimmer to make the finals in the same event four times.

In December of the same year, he announced his retirement.

== Post-swimming career ==
Van den Hoogenband continues to swim recreationally and he remains active in the sports industry. He has served as a commentator for many swimming events, including the 2012 Summer Olympics. The swimming arena in the sporting centre of Eindhoven was named the &quot;Pieter van den Hoogenband Zwemstadion&quot;.

Van den Hoogenband was the Chef de mission for the 2024 Netherlands Olympic team. In July 2024 he said he was surprised by the fuss surrounding beach volleyball player Steven van de Velde despite the fact van de Velde pleaded guilty to three counts of child rape in 2016.

==Personal life==
Van den Hoogenband was married to his longtime girlfriend Minouche Smit who is also a former swimmer. They have two children. In September 2012 the couple announced their divorce. Then Van den Hoogenband dated Ranomi Kromowidjojo, also a multiple Olympic gold medalist. Their relationship ended in 2014. On 16 September 2016 Van den Hoogenband married Marie-José Crooijmans.

Despite a fierce rivalry, Van den Hoogenband is a good friend of Australian Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe.

<text>Camunda is a process orchestration platform used to control complex business processes for enterprise companies. The software is classified by specialist media as a business process automation tool or digital process automation software and therefore represents a further development of the classic workflow management platform.

== Overview ==
Process orchestration is the main topic at the biannual CamundaCon (formerly BPM Con)[6], which is organized by Camunda. Other conferences such as JAX (and W-JAX) or Devoxx are also regularly dedicated to the topic.

==History==
Camunda 7 is an originally commercial workflow management system, which was based on Activiti, a free business process management system. Alongside Alfresco, Camunda was one of the biggest contributors of Activiti.

On 18 March 2013, the further development of Camunda was spun off from the development of Activiti.

==Features==

Camunda consists of a number of components and applications that are used together to define and execute business processes:

The Camunda Modeler desktop application and web modeler allow developers to create and edit BPMN process diagrams and DMN decision tables.

External endpoints can be integrated into processes via Connectors, which are pre-built and customizable packages consisting of BPMN-elements and API templates. With the release of Camunda 8.3, Camunda Marketplace was added, allowing users to share and download additional Connectors for various business systems.

Created files are deployed in the Camunda Engines, which use a BPMN parser to transform BPMN 2.0 XML files, and DMN XML files, into Java Objects, and implements BPMN 2.0 constructs with a set of BPMN Behavior implementations.

Typical use cases for the Camunda BPMN Workflow Engine can be microservices orchestration and human task management.

The Camunda DMN Decision Engine executes business-driven decision tables. It is pre-integrated with the Workflow Engine but can be used as a stand-alone application via REST or inside Java applications.

Camunda&#x27;s additional web applications provide the following tools for developers and business users:

* Operate: A tool for technical process operations enabling users to monitor workflows and decisions in production, to analyze and solve technical problems.

* Tasklist: Allows end users to work on assigned tasks and provides additional visibility when using the Camunda Workflow Engine for human task management.

* Optimize: An analytics and reporting tool to identify errors and bottlenecks in workflow processes.

* Modeler: A collaborative modeling tool allowing multiple users to create, edit and specify BPMN process diagrams. 

* Console: Allows users to manage Camunda web applications or REST API users. Existing user management can be integrated via LDAP.
==Architecture==
Camunda Platform is a lightweight, Java-based framework. It can be used as a standalone process engine server or embedded inside custom Java applications. It offers non-Java developers a REST API and dedicated client libraries to build applications connecting to a remote workflow engine.

<doc id="101202" wikidata="Q1061550" url="?curid=101202" title="Chamunda">
<text>Chamunda (, ), also known as Chamundeshwari, Chamundi or Charchika, is a fearsome form of Chandi, the Hindu mother goddess, Mahadevi and is one of the seven Matrikas.

She is also one of the chief Yoginis, a group of sixty-four or eighty-one Tantric goddesses, who are attendants of the warrior goddess Parvati. The name is a combination of Chanda and Munda, two demons whom Chamunda killed. She is closely associated with Kali, another fierce aspect of Parvati. She is identified with goddesses Parvati, Kali or Durga.

The goddess is often portrayed as residing in cremation grounds or near holy fig trees. The goddess is worshipped by ritual animal sacrifices along with offerings of wine. The practice of animal sacrifices has become less common with Vaishnavite influences.

==Origins==
Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar says that Chamunda was originally a tribal goddess, worshipped by the tribals of the Vindhya mountains in central India. These tribes were known to offer goddesses animal as well as human sacrifices along with liquor. These methods of worship were retained in Tantric worship of Chamunda, after its assimilation into mainstream Hinduism. He proposes the fierce nature of this goddess is due to her association with Rudra (Shiva), identified with the fire god Agni at times. Wangu also backs the theory of the tribal origins of the goddess.

==Iconography==

The black- or red-coloured Chamunda is described as wearing a garland of severed heads or skulls (&quot;Mundamala&quot;). She is described as having four, eight, ten or twelve arms, holding a Damaru (drum), trishula (trident), sword, snake, skull-mace (&quot;khatvanga&quot;), thunderbolt, a severed head and &quot;panapatra&quot; (drinking vessel) or skull-cup (kapala), filled with blood. She stands or sits upon the corpse of a man (&quot;shava&quot; or &quot;preta&quot;), a defeated demon or corpse. She is adorned with bones, skulls, and serpents. She also wears a &quot;Yajnopavita&quot; (sacred thread) of skulls. She wears a &quot;jata mukuta&quot;, that is, a headdress formed of piled, matted hair tied together with snakes or skull ornaments. Sometimes, a crescent moon is seen on her head. Her eye sockets are described as burning the world with flames. She is accompanied by spirits. She is also shown to be surrounded by skeletons, ghosts and beasts like jackals, who are shown eating the flesh of the corpse the goddess sits or stands on. The jackals and her fearsome companions are sometimes depicted as drinking blood from her skull-cup or the severed head she is holding, implying that Chamunda drinks the blood of the defeated enemies. This quality of drinking blood is a characteristic of all Matrikas, and Chamunda in particular. At times, she is depicted seated on an owl, her vahana (mount or vehicle), or a buffalo or Dhole. Her banner figures an eagle.

These characteristics, a contrast to the typical depictions of Hindu goddesses with full breasts and beautiful faces, symbolise the inevitability of old age, death, decay and destruction. Chamunda is often seen as a form of Kali. She appears as a frightening old woman, projecting fear and horror.

==Legends==


In Hindu scripture &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot;, Chamunda emerged as &quot;Chandika Jayasundara&quot; from an eyebrow of goddess &quot;Kaushiki&quot;, a goddess created from &quot;sheath&quot; of Durga and was assigned the task of eliminating the demons Chanda and Munda, generals of demon kings Shumbha-Nishumbha. She fought a fierce battle with the demons, ultimately killing them.

According to a later episode of the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot;, Durga created Matrikas from herself and with their help slaughtered the demon army of Shumbha-Nishumbha. In this version, Kali is described as a Matrika who sucked all the blood of the demon Raktabīja, from whose blood drop rose another demon. Kali is given the epithet Chamunda in the text. Thus, the Devi Mahatmya identifies Chamunda with Kali.

In the &quot;Varaha Purana&quot;, the story of Raktabija is retold, but here each of Matrikas appears from the body of another Matrika. Chamunda appears from the foot of the lion-headed goddess Narasimhi. Here, Chamunda is considered a representation of the vice of tale-telling (&quot;pasunya&quot;). The Varaha Purana text clearly mentions two separate goddesses Chamunda and Kali, unlike Devi Mahatmya.

According to another legend, Chamunda appeared from the frown of the benign goddess Parvati to kill demons Chanda and Munda. Here, Chamunda is viewed as a form of Parvati.

The &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; tells a different story of Chamunda&#x27;s origins. She with other matrikas was created by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has an ability - like Raktabīja - to generate from his dripping blood. Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks the blood of the demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him. Ratnākara, in his text &quot;Haravijaya&quot;, also describes this feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka. Having drunk the blood, Chamunda&#x27;s complexion changed to blood-red. The text further says that Chamunda does a dance of destruction, playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru, the string is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the crescent moon. She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world.

==Association with Matrikas==

Chamunda is one of the saptamatrikas or Seven Mothers. The Matrikas are fearsome mother goddesses, abductors and eaters of children; that is, they were emblematic of childhood pestilence, fever, starvation, and disease. They were propitiated in order to avoid those ills, that carried off so many children before they reached adulthood.
Chamunda is included in the &quot;Saptamatrika&quot; (seven Matrikas or mothers) lists in the Hindu texts like the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (Chapter &#x27;Vana-parva&#x27;), the &quot;Devi Purana&quot; and the &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot;. She is often depicted in the Saptamatrika group in sculptures, examples of which are Ellora and Elephanta caves. Though she is always portrayed last (rightmost) in the group, she is sometimes referred to as the leader of the group. While other Matrikas are considered as Shaktis (powers) of male divinities and resemble them in their appearance, Chamunda is the only Matrika who is a Shakti of the great Goddess Devi rather than a male god. She is also the only Matrika who enjoys independent worship of her own; all other Matrikas are always worshipped together.

The &quot;Devi Purana&quot; describe a pentad of Matrikas who help Ganesha to kill demons. Further, sage Mandavya is described as worshipping the &quot;Māṭrpaňcaka&quot; (the five mothers), Chamunda being one of them. The mothers are described as established by the creator god Brahma for saving king Harishchandra from calamities. Apart from usual meaning of Chamunda as slayer of demons Chanda and Munda, the &quot;Devi Purana&quot; gives a different explanation: &quot;Chanda&quot; means terrible while &quot;Munda&quot; stands for Brahma&#x27;s head or lord or husband.

In the &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot; - where the Matrikas are compared to vices - Chamunda is considered as a manifestation of depravity. Every matrika is considered guardian of a direction. Chamunda is assigned the direction of south-west.

Chamunda, being a Matrika, is considered one of the chief Yoginis, who are considered to be daughters or manifestations of the Matrikas. In the context of a group of sixty-four yoginis, Chamunda is believed to have created seven other yoginis, together forming a group of eight. In the context of eighty-one yoginis, Chamunda heads a group of nine yoginis.

==Worship==

A South Indian inscription describes ritual sacrifices of sheep to Chamunda. In Bhavabhuti&#x27;s eighth century Sanskrit play, Malatimadhva describes a devotee of the goddess trying to sacrifice the heroine to Chamunda&#x27;s temple, near a cremation ground, where the goddess temple is. A stone inscription at Gangadhar, Rajasthan, deals with a construction to a shrine to Chamunda and the other Matrikas, &quot;who are attended by Dakinis&quot; (female demons) and rituals of daily Tantric worship (&quot;Tantrobhuta&quot;) like the ritual of &quot;Bali&quot; (offering of grain). Chamunda puja is a part of Sandhi Puja, a key ritual during Durga Puja. During Sandhi Puja, which takes place between the final 24 minutes of Ashtami and the first 24 minutes of Nabami, Goddess Durga is worshipped in her Chamunda form. 
===Temples===


* In the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, around west of Palampur, is the renowned Chamunda Devi Temple which depicts scenes from the Devi Mahatmya, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The goddess&#x27;s image is flanked by the images of Hanuman and Bhairava. Another temple, Chamunda Nandikeshwar Dham, also found in Kangra, is dedicated to Shiva and Chamunda. According to a legend, Chamunda was enshrined as chief deity &quot;Rudra Chamunda&quot;, in the battle between the demon Jalandhara and Shiva.
* In Gujarat, two Chamunda shrines are on the hills of Chotila and Parnera.
* There are multiple Chamunda temples in Odisha. The 8th-century Baitala Deula is the most prominent of them, also being one of the earliest temples in Bhubaneswar. The Mohini temple and Chitrakarini temple in Bhubaneswar are also dedicated to Chamunda. Kichakeshwari Temple, near Baripada; and Charchika Temple, near Banki, enshrine forms of Chamunda.
* Another temple is Chamundeshwari Temple on Chamundi Hill, Mysore. Here, the goddess is identified with Durga, who killed the buffalo demon, Mahishasura. Chamundeshwari or Durga, the fierce form of Shakti, a tutelary deity held in reverence for centuries by the Maharaja of Mysore.
* The Chamunda Mataji temple in Mehrangarh Fort, Jodhpur, was established in 1460 after the idol of the goddess Chamunda — the Kuladevi and iṣṭa-devatā (tutelary deity) of the Parihar rulers — was moved from the old capital of Mandore by the then-ruler Jodha of Mandore. The goddess is still worshiped by the royal family of Jodhpur and other citizens of the city. The temple witnesses festivities in Dussehra: the festival of the goddess.
* Another temple, Sri Chamundeshwari Kshetram is near Jogipet, in Medak District in Telangana State.
*Sree Shakthan Kulangara temple is one of Chamundeshwari temples. It is located in Koyilandy, Kozhikode District in Kerala.
*One Chamunda Mata temple is situated in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, It is situated on a hill top named Tekri above 300 feet. Chamunda Mata in Dewas is also called Choti Mata (the younger sister of Tulja mata, situated at the same hill top).

===In Buddhism===
In Vajrayana Buddhism, Chamunda is associated with Palden Lhamo. She is seen as a wrathful form of Kali and is a consort of Mahakala and protectress of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama of the Gelug school.

===In Jainism===

Early Jains were dismissive of Chamunda, the goddess who demands blood sacrifice - which is against the primary principle of Ahimsa of Jainism. Some Jain legends portray Chamunda as a goddess defeated by Jain monks like Jinadatta, Jinaprabhasuri. However, the most popular legend is of Ratnaprabhasuri.

Another Jain legend tells the story of conversion of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavir image for the temple in Osian and was happy with the conversions of Hindu to Jainism and the subsequent renaming of their clan to Oswal. At the time of Navaratri, a festival that celebrates the Hindu Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from Jains. The Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Jain monk Ratnaprabhasuri intervened and preached her, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat and liquor. Ratnaprabhasuri further named her &quot;Sacciya&quot;, one who had told the truth, as Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian was beneficial for him. She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess of the Osvals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour by Jains. Some Jain scriptures warn of dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals. Many Kshatriyas and even the Jain community worship her as her Kuladevi and &quot;samyaktvi&quot; demi-goddess as per Jain rituals.

<text>Akureyri (, ) is a town in northern Iceland, the country&#x27;s fifth most populous municipality (under the official name of Akureyrarbær , &#x27;town of Akureyri&#x27;) and the largest outside the Capital Region. The municipality includes the town&#x27;s neighbourhood at the head of Eyjafjörður and two farther islands: Hrísey at the mouth of Eyjafjörður and Grímsey off the coast.

Nicknamed the &quot;Capital of North Iceland&quot;, Akureyri is an important port and fishing centre. The area where Akureyri is located was settled in the 9th century, but did not receive a municipal charter until 1786. Allied units were based in the town during World War II. Further growth occurred after the war as the Icelandic population increasingly moved to urban areas.

The area has a relatively mild climate because of geographical factors, and the town&#x27;s ice-free harbour has played a significant role in its history.

== History ==
The Norse Viking Helgi &quot;magri&quot; (the slim) Eyvindarson originally settled the area in the 9th century. The first mention of Akureyri is in court records from 1562, when a woman was sentenced there for adultery. In the 17th century, Danish merchants based their camps at the current site of Akureyri, which was one of the numerous spits of land in Pollurinn. The main reasons for choosing this spot for trading operations were the outstanding natural harbour and the fertility of the area. The merchants did not live at Akureyri year-round, but returned home in the winter.

Permanent settlement at Akureyri started in 1778, and eight years later, the town was granted its municipal charter by the king, Christian VII, along with five other towns in Iceland. The king hoped to improve the living conditions of Icelanders by this action, because at the time, Iceland had never had urban areas. As far as the king was concerned, Akureyri was unsuccessful, because it did not grow from its population of 12. It lost its municipal status in 1836, regaining it only in 1862. From then on, Akureyri grew because of the excellent port conditions and perhaps more because of the productive agricultural region around it. Agricultural products became an important sector of the economy.

During World War II, Akureyri was one of three air bases used by the Norwegian-British No. 330 Squadron RNoAF. The squadron, which was formed on 25 April 1941, flew Northrop N-3PB bombers: &#x27;A&#x27; flight was based at RAF Reykjavik, &#x27;B&#x27; flight at Akureyri and &#x27;C&#x27; flight at Budareyri (Reyðarfjörður now). On 1 December 1940, &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; flights ceased operating from Norwegian bases, but &#x27;C&#x27; flight continued to fly Northrop N-3PBs from Akureyri until 5 April 1943. No. 330 Squadron RNoAF also operated Catalina flying boats from Akureyri, which protected convoys between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Murmansk in northern Russia from attack by German submarines. Under the German plan for invasion of Iceland, &quot;Operation Ikarus&quot;, Akureyri was scheduled as one of two ports at which the Germans were to land.

In the 20th century, Iceland experienced an exodus from the countryside to the towns. Commerce and service industries grew to be the primary employers in Akureyri in the 1990s. Jón Sveinsson, a popular author of children&#x27;s books, was born in Akureyri.

In the early 21st century, fishing industries have become more important in Akureyri as two of the major fishing companies of Iceland have become a more important source of revenue and are expected to grow further in coming years. The University of Akureyri was founded in 1987 and is growing rapidly.

Since 2004, the former municipality of Hrísey, an island to the north, has been a part of Akureyri. Hrísey, which has a population of 210, is the second-largest island off Iceland and is a site for pet and livestock quarantine. The settlement was previously the site of fishing processing. The town is located on the southern part of the island. The northern part consists of privately owned land that requires passes to enter.

== Geography ==
Akureyri is located at and positioned on the west side of the inland end of the fjord Eyjafjörður.

It is surrounded by mountains, the highest being Strýta (); to the west) and Kerling () at the head of Glerádalur , to the southwest. It has a narrow coastal strip of flat land; inland is a steep but low hill. In earlier times, a few spits of land (Icelandic: &quot;eyri&quot;, thus Akur-eyri) jutted from the narrow coast, but much land has since been reclaimed from the sea, so that today the coastline is more even except for the largest spit, Oddeyri , which was formed by the river Glerá, which runs through the town. The name of the town is possibly derived from the name of a field that may have been situated near some of the sheltered locations by the river.

The body of sea between Oddeyri and the end of the fjord is known as Pollurinn (&quot;The Pool&quot;) and is known for calm winds and a good natural harbour. Akureyri today is centered on Ráðhústorg (Town Hall Square) near the northwest corner of Pollurinn. The districts of Akureyri are: Innbær , the oldest part of town on the strip of land between the hill and Pollurinn south of the central area; Brekkan , on top of the hill; Oddeyri on the peninsula of the same name; and Glerárhverfi on the north bank of the Glerá (also referred to colloquially as Þorpið , &#x27;the Village&#x27;). Because of the town&#x27;s position at the head of a long fjord surrounded by high mountains, the climate is more typically inland than coastal, with greater variations in temperature (warmer summers, colder winters) than in many other inhabited parts of Iceland. However, the mountains shield the town from strong winds. The relatively warm climate (for its latitude) allows the botanical gardens to flourish without need of a greenhouse. The area around Akureyri has one of the warmest climates in Iceland, even though it is only from the Arctic Circle.

==Climate==
Akureyri has either the rare dry-summer subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dsc&quot;) if the isotherm is used, or the very rare cold-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csc) if the isotherm is used, with cold though not severe winters and mild summers. The snow cover starts forming in late October and melts in April, yet snow can lie on the mountain peaks around Akureyri for the whole year. Akureyri is a very cloudy town, averaging only 1,029 sunshine hours annually, with barely any sunshine between November and February (which is also due to the town&#x27;s location less than 100 km from the Arctic Circle), but precipitation is much lower than in southern Iceland because the prevailing winds are from the south – it is as little as a fifth as much as in Vík í Mýrdal.

== Demographics ==
As of 2021, Akureyri has a population of 19,219. About 3% of the population are foreign citizens, from 53 countries. In 2014, there were 229 births and 118 deaths in Akureyri. Immigration in 2014 was 1,097 individuals, while emigration was 1,122 residents. Population growth in 2014 was therefore 0.5%. The population in 1910 was 2,239, increasing to 7,711 in 1950 and 16,756 in 2005.

==Crime==
Crime statistics have been published by the Iceland national police for 2000. Akureyri had a reported 726 nontraffic offences per 10,000 population compared with a national average of 892, while 2,891 traffic offences per 10,000 population were recorded compared with a national average of 2,397. Akureyri has five police officers on call. Incidents have occurred where insufficient police officers were on duty to respond to criminal activity in progress, as confirmed by the mayor. However, Akureyri, and Iceland in general, has one of the lowest crime rates in the world.

== Economy ==

The fishing industry has historically been a large and important part of the local economy. In recent years, other industries and business services have also begun. Higher education is also a growing sector in the local economy. About 20% of the work force is in the service industry.

Two of the five largest fishing companies in Iceland are headquartered in Akureyri, partly because of the ice-free port. Other large companies in Akureyri include Samherji, Norðurmjólk, Brim hf, and Vífilfell, the largest brewery in Iceland. Sjúkrahús Akureyrar (FSA/Akureyri Hospital) is a major employer in the area and is one of two major hospitals in Iceland.

Corporations pay a tax rate of 18% to the national government, which is one of the lowest in the world. No additional local corporate taxes are levied. Property tax, at 1.99%, accounts for most of the tax base. A local government deficit of ISK 1 billion (US$9 million) was anticipated in 2009, prompting a cut in salaries of the mayor, town councilors, and committee members by 10% and increases in local taxes and property taxes.

== Culture ==

Akureyri has a robust cultural scene, with several bars and reputable restaurants (such as &quot;Greifinn&quot;, &quot;Bautinn&quot;, &quot;RUB 23 Steak/Sushi&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu sushi bar&quot; and &quot;Götubarinn&quot;). The Icelandic folk dance ensemble &quot;Vefarinn&quot; comes from Akureyri. Folk culture, in general, is more prevalent in Akureyri than in Reykjavík. During the summer, several festivals are held in Akureyri and the surrounding area. One example is the medieval festival held every summer at Gásir. The Akureyri International Music Festival, a concert series by bands, was held for the fourth time in 2009. The town has one of the largest libraries in the country.

=== Media ===
The &quot;Vikudagur&quot; newspaper is published in Akureyri. The Icelandic National Broadcasting Service (Ríkisútvarpið) operates two radio channels nationwide. The several radio stations in Akureyri include FM Akureyri and Voice FM 98.7. Several television stations can be watched in Akureyri. N4 is a station whose studios are located in Akureyri. Initially a local channel, it began to broadcast nationwide in 2008.

== Townscape ==

Sites that have been cited as areas of interest include various museums, churches, and the Botanical Gardens. Local museums include the Minjasafnið á Akureyri (Akureyri Museum), Listasafnið á Akureyri (Akureyri Art Museum), Nonnahús (Nonni house or Jón Sveinsson Memorial Museum, for the writer), Davíðshús (David&#x27;s house or Davíð Stefánsson Memorial Museum, for the poet), Akureyri Museum of Industry, a motorcycle museum, and Flugsafn Íslands (Aviation Museum of Iceland). The most northerly 18 hole golf course in the world is in the town. The Náttúrufræðistofnun Norðurlands (Nature Museum) was opened in 1957 and is in the grounds of the Akureyri Botanical Garden. The Botanical Gardens (Lystigarður Akureyrar) are located in Spítalavegur. Large churches include the Akureyrarkirkja (The church of Akureyri) and Glerárkirkja (The church of Glerá). Sundlaug Akureyrar is a swimming pool in Akureyri.

New residential and commercial growth has required an extension of electricity and water distribution, as well as new water drilling. Much of the town is heated geothermally.

== Administration ==
=== Law and government ===
Akureyri is governed by a town council, directly elected by those over 18 with registered domicile in the town. The council has 11 members, who are elected for four-year terms. The mayor is appointed by the council: usually one of the council members is chosen, but they may also appoint a mayor who is not a member of the council.

The last elections to the town council were held on May 31, 2014. The People&#x27;s List (&quot;Listi fólksins&quot;), which won an outright majority in 2010, and The Town List (&quot;Bæjarlistinn&quot;) merged into L-list, the Town List of Akureyri. They had seven representatives together, but now have only two, 18.8%. The Independence Party (Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn) received the most votes, three seats in the council, 25.8%, instead of only one previously. Social Democratic Alliance (Samfylkingin) and Progressive Party (Framsóknarflokkurinn) each got two seats instead of the previous one each. Left-Green Movement (Vinstri hreyfingin grænt framboð) and Bright Future (Björt framtíð) each got one seat. L-list, Social Democratic Alliance, and the Progressive Party formed a new majority in the council. The new majority decided that Eiríkur Björn Björgvinsson, mayor of Akureyri since 2010, would continue to serve as mayor.

== Transport ==
=== Airport ===

Akureyri Airport, one of four international airports in Iceland and the only international airport in the north of the country, was constructed in 1954 replacing the airstrip at Melgerdismelar further to the south. 

The airport is mostly used for domestic flights. Icelandair flies several times a day to Reykjavík, and there are also domestic flights to Grímsey, Vopnafjörður and Þórshöfn (small settlements in northeast Iceland). 

There are also seasonal scheduled international flights to London-Gatwick, Amsterdam and Zürich with easyJet and Transavia. Nerlerit Inaat in Greenland is also served.

In 2007, Akureyri Airport had a passenger traffic level of 221,200 and 19,778 aircraft movements.

=== Marine port ===
The port of Akureyri is vital to the town, as fisheries are an important part of its economy. It is the site of large fish processing plants and has docking facilities for trawlers. It is also important for freight handling and for tourism, as cruise ships stop in Akureyri during the summer months. The ice-free nature of the port has been important in the town&#x27;s establishment.

=== Bus ===
Local bus services within Akureyri are provided by the SVA (Akureyri Bus Company), which does not charge fares. The cessation of fares in 2008 resulted in an increase of 130% in passenger numbers compared to the previous year when fares were charged.

=== Roads ===
Route 1 or the Ring Road (Þjóðvegur 1 or Hringvegur) connects the town with the other parts of the country, including Reykjavík, which is away. The road is mostly one lane in each direction, but is paved and open year-round. The Vaðlaheiðargöng tunnel is directly east of the town on Route 1. It opened for traffic in December 2018, reducing the road distance from Akureyri to Mývatn lake by . It is currently Iceland&#x27;s only toll road. 

Parking in the city centre is subject to fees as of 2023, split into two zones.

The F821 mountain road climbs southwards from Akureyri and connects with the F26 mountain road across the highlands towards the south of the country. It is only open during summer. 

== Utilities ==
Akureyri has been heated geothermally since the late 1970s. Starting in 1928, there were unsuccessful attempts to develop geothermal energy. During this period, electricity and oil were used for heating. Construction of a geothermal distribution system was begun in 1976 after the discovery of a commercially viable source in 1975. Distribution was widespread by 1979.

The Laugaland field near Akureyri was the first geothermal source commercially developed. The Ytri-Tjarnir field followed. To obtain sufficient water flow, additional fields were developed at Botn in 1980, Glerárdalur SW of the town in 1981, and Þelamörk north of the town in 1992. Water temperature is generally but can drop to during hot summer days. The cost of geothermal production is, at 32 mill/kwh, higher than the Icelandic national average of 11, but slightly less than the cost of imported heating oil. There is diminishing excess capacity but there are known and untapped resources near the town. Furthermore, there have been proposals to reinject water to extend the life of the sources.

==Sports==

Knattspyrnufélag Akureyrar (KA) and Þór Akureyri are the two biggest multi-sport clubs in the town. They field teams in several sports, such as basketball, football and handball.

The most successful football team of late in the town has been Þór/KA, a joint women&#x27;s team from KA and Þór. Since 2008, it has finished in the top four in the top-tier Úrvalsdeild kvenna, winning the national championship in 2012 and 2017. The clubs also have two men&#x27;s football teams under their own names.

The clubs field a joint team in women&#x27;s handball, KA/Þór. They fielded a joint men&#x27;s team under the name Akureyri Handboltafélag from 2016 to 2017 before KA broke off from the cooperation and fielded a separate team in 2017–2018.

In basketball, Þór fields both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s team. Its women&#x27;s team has won the national championship three times: in 1969, 1971 and 1976.

The town&#x27;s ice hockey team, Skautafélag Akureyrar, is the most successful team in the history of the Icelandic Hockey League, with 20 championships from 1992 to 2018.

The Akureyri Golf Club is the second oldest golf club in Iceland behind the Reykjavík Golf Club. It was established in 1935 and is the annual location of The Arctic Open held each summer solstice. The town is also the birthplace of Icelandic footballers Birkir Bjarnason and Aron Gunnarsson, as well as mixed martial arts fighter Gunnar Nelson.

<doc id="101210" wikidata="Q2995979" url="?curid=101210" title="Hull, Quebec">
<text>Hull is the central business district and oldest neighbourhood of the city of Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. It is located on the west bank of the Gatineau River and the north shore of the Ottawa River, directly opposite Ottawa. As part of Canada&#x27;s National Capital Region, it contains offices for more than 20,000 civil servants. It was named after Kingston upon Hull in England.

==History==
===Early history===


Hull is a former municipality in the Province of Quebec and the location of the oldest non-Indigenous settlement in the National Capital Region. Prior to European settlement, various Anishinaabe peoples including the Algonquins inhabited the area. It was founded on the north shore of the Ottawa River in 1800 by Philemon Wright at the portage around the Chaudière Falls just upstream (or west) from where the Gatineau and Rideau Rivers flow into the Ottawa. Wright brought his family, five other families and twenty-five labourers and a plan to establish an agriculturally based community in what was a mosquito-infested wilderness. Soon after, Wright and his family took advantage of the large lumber stands and became involved in the timber trade. Originally the place was named Wright&#x27;s Town, Lower Canada, and the name Wrightville survives as the name of a neighbourhood in Gatineau&#x27;s Hull district.

The Gatineau River, like the Ottawa River, was very much the preserve of the &quot;draveurs&quot;, people who would use the river to transport logs from lumber camps to mills downriver. (The Gatineau River flows south into the Ottawa River which flows east to the St Lawrence River near Montreal.) The log-filled Ottawa River, as viewed from Hull, appeared on the back of the Canadian one-dollar bill until it was replaced by a dollar coin (the &quot;loonie&quot;) in 1987, and the last of the dwindling activity of the draveurs on these rivers ended a few years later.

Ottawa was founded later, as the terminus of the Rideau Canal, built under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John By as part of fortifications and defences constructed after the War of 1812. Originally named Bytown, Ottawa did not become Canada&#x27;s capital until the mid-19th century after the original Parliament Building in Montreal was torched by a rioting mob of English-speaking citizens on April 25, 1849. Its greater distance from the Canada–US border also left the new Parliament Buildings in Ottawa less vulnerable to foreign attack.

Nothing remains of the original 1800 settlement; the downtown Vieux-Hull sector was razed by a destructive fire in 1900 which also destroyed the original &quot;pont des Chaudières&quot; (Chaudière Bridge), a road bridge which has since been rebuilt to join Ottawa to Hull at Victoria Island.

===1917 to 2000===

Hull was noted for its nightlife during the years 1917 to 2000.

Prohibition on the sale of alcohol in Ontario began in 1916, and continued until the repeal of the &quot;Ontario Temperance Act&quot; in 1927. Hull&#x27;s proximity to Ontario made it a convenient place for people from Ottawa to consume alcohol, and a sharp increase in arrests for drunk and disorderly conduct was noted in Hull in 1917. As a result, in May 1918, Hull enacted local laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol. This led to a dramatic increase in bootlegging in Hull, and the town gained the nickname &quot;le Petit Chicago&quot;, because its per capita crime rates were similar to those in Chicago. In 1919, a local plebiscite repealed Hull&#x27;s prohibition laws, causing Hull&#x27;s drinking establishments to once again thrive as a result of the continued prohibition in neighbouring Ontario. Most of Hull&#x27;s bars were conveniently located near the Alexandra Bridge to Ottawa, which a local newspaper called, &quot;the bridge of the thousand thirsts&quot;.

Hull&#x27;s Chief of Police stated in 1924 that the cause of Hull&#x27;s lawlessness was its proximity to Ottawa, and a report published in 1925 found that visitors to Hull accounted for up to 90 percent of its bar patrons, as well as the vast majority of those arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct. A newspaper in the 1920s stated, &quot;these taverns, which are Hull&#x27;s sole attraction, are not bar rooms, but barn-like, dim rooms in old buildings&quot;.

During the early 1940s—when bars in Ontario closed at 1 am and bars in Quebec closed at 3 am—residents of Ontario continued to take advantage of Quebec&#x27;s more liberal policies on alcohol control. An official inquiry in the 1940s found that gambling houses and illegal bars in Hull were receiving protection from corrupt local politicians, who also encouraged police not to arrest prostitutes.

During World War II, Hull, along with various other regions within Canada, such as the Saguenay, Lac Saint-Jean, and Île Sainte-Hélène, had Prisoner-of-war camps. Hull&#x27;s prison was simply labelled with a number and remained unnamed just like Canada&#x27;s other war prisons. The &quot;prisoners of war&quot; (POWs) were sorted and classified into categories by nationality and civilian or military status. In this camp, POWs were mostly Italian and German nationals. During the Conscription Crisis of 1944 the prison eventually included Canadians who had refused conscription. Also, prisoners were forced into hard labour which included farming the land and lumbering.

The Macdonald-Cartier Bridge was constructed in 1965, pushing many of Hull&#x27;s bars to streets north. A large office complex known as Place du Portage began construction in the 1970s, uprooting many businesses along what was once the town&#x27;s main commercial area, and displacing some 4,000 residents.

The disco era of the 1970s ushered in new prosperity for Hull&#x27;s nightlife, and &quot;Viva Disco&quot; was named in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten in North America.

In the early 1980s, Hull City Council began encouraging the expansion of bars in the downtown area. Bars in Hull continued to remain open two additional hours compared to bars in Ontario, and some bars offered a shuttle service from Ottawa.

By 1985, Hull had the highest crime rate in Quebec, with offences in the bar district including murder, drug dealing, rowdiness, violence, noise, vandalism and drunkenness.

The Canadian Museum of History relocated nearby in 1989, and politicians in Hull expressed concern about the city&#x27;s image. Official committees in Hull weighed the job creation and profitability of Hull&#x27;s nightlife, against the costs of policing and cleanup. A &quot;zero tolerance&quot; campaign began in 1990, which involved undercover policing, the revocation of liquor licences, and a public awareness campaign to inform young drinkers in Ontario that disorderly behaviour would not be tolerated in Hull. Soon, police in Hull were aggressively towing illegally parked cars, and individuals caught urinating in public were fined as much as $400.

By 2000, Hull had spent considerable resources making the downtown more attractive, and the decaying old core of Hull was transformed by demolition and replacement with a series of large office complexes. Most of the bars on the Hull strip were gone, and were replaced by restaurants, cafés and stores. The city also provided funds to businesses that wanted to renovate. This resulted in a 75 percent drop in crime in the former bar district from 1994 to 2000, and the main street &quot;was no longer attracting large crowds looking for a fight&quot;. Prostitution was not affected. Mayor Yves Ducharme expressed a desire to attract residents back to downtown Hull, and encouraged the construction of studio and bachelor apartments on Promenade du Portage, across from the federal government buildings.

Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney wrote of Hull:
The town [Ottawa] visibly sagged by ten at night, just in time for residents seeking relief from the stifling boredom to cross the bridge to Hull, Quebec, where nightclubs, dancehalls, bars, and a few great restaurants provided sanctuary and stimulation.

===Amalgamation===

In 2002, the Parti Québécois, leading the provincial government, merged the cities of Hull, Gatineau, Aylmer, Buckingham and Masson-Angers into one city. Although Hull was the oldest and most central of the merged cities, the name Gatineau was the only original city name among the five final names offered as choices for the amalgamated city. A majority of the residents of all five cities chose Gatineau.

In 2004, there was a referendum to decide whether Hull would remain in Gatineau. The majority of those who voted in Hull voted against the de-amalgamation, and the status quo prevailed.

==Geography==
Hull is located at the confluence of the Gatineau and Ottawa rivers.

Navigation beyond Ottawa-Hull on the Ottawa River is still difficult as watercraft must be removed from the Ottawa River due to obstacles posed by rapids such as the &quot;Rapides des Chaudières&quot; or &quot;Kettle Rapids&quot;.

==Demographics==
Prior to amalgamation in 2002, Hull&#x27;s population was 66,246 (2001 Census of Canada). According to the Canada 2011 Census, Hull had a population of 69,004.

Approximately 80% of residents speak French as their first language and about 9% English as their first language (2001 Census of Canada).

==Education==
Commission Scolaire des Portages-de-l&#x27;Outaouais (CSPO) operates Francophone public schools.

Western Québec School Board operates Anglophone public schools.

==Economy==
Hull now depends primarily on the civil service as an economic mainstay. A number of federal and provincial government departments are located here. The policy of the federal government to distribute federal jobs on both sides of the Ottawa River led to the construction of several massive office towers to house federal civil servants in the 1970s and 80s; the largest of these are Place du Portage and Terrasses de la Chaudière, occupying part of what had been the downtown core of Hull.

Two paper mills (Scott Paper and the E. B. Eddy division of Domtar) still retain some industrial facilities on the Ottawa River in the centre of Hull, Quebec.

Hull is also the home to the Casino du Lac-Leamy and to the Canadian Museum of History directly opposite Parliament Hill. Hull is also Outaouais&#x27;s cultural centre.

<text>Hendrika Wilhelmina &quot;Rie&quot; Mastenbroek (26 February 1919 – 6 November 2003) was a Dutch swimmer and a triple Olympic champion.

==Biography==
Born in Rotterdam, she started swimming under the coaching of &quot;Ma&quot; Braun, who had coached her daughter to an Olympic gold medal in 1928. In 1934, Mastenbroek won three gold medals and a silver at the European Championships.

She repeated that performance at the 1936 Summer Olympics, aged only 17, winning the 100 m freestyle, 400 m freestyle and the 4×100 m freestyle. In the 100 m backstroke, she finished second behind teammate Nida Senff. (Senff missed a turning point and had to swim back before completing the last 50 m. She nevertheless beat Mastenbroek thanks to an outstanding last leg.)

The following year she became a swimming instructor, thereby losing her amateur status and becoming ineligible for competition.

During her career she broke nine world records (six for backstroke and three for freestyle). In 1968 she was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. In 1997 she received the Olympic Order.

She died at age 84 in Rotterdam. After her death, &quot;Stichting Aquarius&quot; named the Rie Mastenbroek Trophy after her.

<text>Croydon Airport was the UK&#x27;s only international airport during the interwar period. It opened in 1920, located near Croydon, then part of Surrey. Built in a Neoclassical style, it was developed as Britain&#x27;s main airport, handling more cargo, mail, and passengers than any other UK airport at the time. Innovations at the site included the world&#x27;s first air traffic control, the first airport terminal and the world&#x27;s first airport hotel (the Gate Lodge, now the Aerodrome Hotel
). It was home to Britain&#x27;s first national airline, Imperial Airways, founded through a government sponsored four-airline merger in 1924. During World War II the airport was named RAF Croydon as its role changed to that of a fighter airfield during the Battle of Britain; and in 1943 RAF Transport Command was founded at the site, which used the airport to transport thousands of troops into and out of Europe.

After the Second World War, its role returned to civil aviation, but the lack of available land for expansion meant that the role of London&#x27;s primary international airport later passed to London Heathrow Airport. Croydon Airport closed in 1959. It had been known under eight different names while it was active.

In 1978, the terminal building and Gate Lodge were granted protection as Grade II listed buildings. In May 2017, Historic England raised the status of the terminal building to Grade II*. Owing to disrepair, the Gate Lodge is now classified as Heritage at Risk by Historic England.

==History==
===Origin===
In December 1915, Beddington Aerodrome was established – one of a number of small airfields around London that were created for protection against Zeppelin airship raids during the First World War. In January 1916, the first two aircraft, B.E.2Cs, arrived at the aerodrome as part of Home Defence. Waddon Aerodrome opened in 1918 as part of the adjoining National Aircraft Factory No. 1, to serve aircraft test flights. The two airfields were on each side of Plough Lane, Beddington to the west and Waddon to the east.

Beddington Aerodrome became a large Reserve Aircraft and Training aerodrome for the Royal Flying Corps. After the end of the First World War the aerodrome became an important training airfield for the newly formed Royal Air Force. During 1919, Prince Albert (later George VI) gained his &quot;wings&quot; here with No. 29 Training Squadron, the first member of the royal family to learn to fly. His elder brother, the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII), also received flying training with No. 29 Training Squadron at Beddington during 1919.

The following units were also here at some point:
Beddington and Waddon aerodromes were combined to become Croydon Aerodrome, the gateway for all international flights to and from London. The new, single aerodrome opened on 29 March 1920, replacing the temporary civil aerodrome at a Cavalry ground on Hounslow Heath. Plough Lane remained a public road crossing the site. Road traffic was halted when necessary, first by a man with a red flag and later by a gate. The aerodrome stimulated a growth in regular scheduled flights carrying passengers, mail and freight, the first destinations being Paris, Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Two flights daily from Paris were scheduled for ease of communication with London during the Paris Peace Conference. In 1923, flights to Berlin Tempelhof Airport began.

Penshurst Airfield was an alternative destination for airliners when Croydon was closed on account of fog. One such diversion was on 24 September 1921, when a de Havilland DH.18 aircraft was diverted to Penshurst. This situation lasted until Penshurst closed on 28 July 1936.

Croydon was the first airport in the world to introduce air traffic control, a control tower, and radio position-fixing procedures. The &quot;aerodrome control tower&quot;, high with windows on all four sides, was commissioned on 25 February 1920 and provided basic traffic, weather and location information to pilots. There, Jimmy Jeffs was its first air traffic control officer.

On the formation of Britain&#x27;s first national airline, Imperial Airways, on 31 March 1924, Croydon became the new airline&#x27;s operating base. Imperial Airways was the British Government&#x27;s chosen instrument to develop connections with the U.K.&#x27;s extensive overseas interests. It was therefore from Croydon that Britain first developed its European and longhaul routes to India, Africa, the Middle and Far East, Asia, Africa and Australia (in conjunction with Qantas).

Following the Imperial Airways de Havilland DH.34 crash of December 1924, Britain&#x27;s first major civil aviation accident, conditions at Croydon came under criticism from the public inquiry that investigated the causes. The inquiry was Britain&#x27;s first into an aviation accident which led to an Act of Parliament, the Croydon Aerodrome Extension Act 1925. The Croydon Aerodrome Extension Act led to large scale expansion, redevelopment and construction of an improved new airport with airport buildings constructed adjacent to the Purley Way, Croydon.

===Expansion===
Under the provisions of the Croydon Aerodrome Extension Act 1925, the airport was greatly enlarged between 1926 and 1928, with a new complex of buildings being constructed alongside Purley Way, including the first purpose-designed airport terminal and air traffic control tower, the world&#x27;s first airport hotel, and extensive hangars. The development cost £267,000 (£ in today&#x27;s prices) . Plough Lane was closed permanently to let heavier airliners land and depart safely. The airport&#x27;s terminal building and control tower were completed in 1928, and the old wooden air traffic control and customs building demolished. The new buildings and layout began operations on 20 January 1928, and were officially opened on 2 May 1928 by Lady Maud Hoare.

Croydon was where regular international passenger services began, initially using converted wartime bombers, and the Croydon–Le Bourget route soon became the busiest in the world. Air traffic control was first developed here, as was the &quot;Mayday&quot; distress call. Amy Johnson took off from Croydon on 5 May 1930 for her record-breaking flight to Australia. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh arrived in &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, to be greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of over 100,000 people. Winston Churchill also took flying lessons.

On the morning of 11 July 1936, Major Hugh Pollard, and Cecil Bebb left Croydon Airport for the Canary Islands in a de Havilland Dragon Rapide aircraft, where they picked up General Francisco Franco, taking him to Spanish Morocco and thereby helping to trigger the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.

Imperial Airways used the Handley Page HP42/HP45 four-engined biplanes from Croydon, and the Armstrong Whitworth Atalanta, which was the first monoplane airliner used by the airline, intended for use on the African routes. In March 1937 British Airways Ltd operated from Croydon, moving to Heston Aerodrome in May 1938. Imperial Airways, serving routes in the British Empire, and British Airways Ltd, serving European routes, were merged by the Chamberlain government in November 1938 to become British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). Larger four-engined monoplanes, Armstrong Whitworth Ensign series (G-ADSR) came into service that year.

The airport also hosted a much-publicised visit by Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, leader of the National Socialist Women&#x27;s League (NS-Frauenschaft) and rumoured to be a spy; historians have speculated that she landed in Britain to cultivate German spies living here, in the run-up to WWII.

===Second World War===

When the Second World War started in September 1939, Croydon Airport was closed to civil aviation but played a vital role as a fighter station during the Battle of Britain. No. 92 Squadron flew Supermarine Spitfires from RAF Croydon during the early part of the Second World War and the Battle of Britain.

The following units were here at some point:

;Units:
====Battle of Britain====
On 15 August 1940, Croydon Airport was attacked in the first major air raid on the London area. At around 6.20 pm 22 Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter-bombers of &quot;Erpr.Gr.210&quot; mounted a final raid of the day, intended for RAF Kenley nearby, but attacked Croydon (four miles further north) in error. The armoury was destroyed, the civilian airport terminal building was badly damaged, and a hangar was damaged by cannon fire and blast. Another hangar and about forty training aircraft in it went up in flames. Six airfield personnel died (four airmen from No. 111 Squadron, an officer of No. 1 Squadron RCAF, and a female telephonist from Station HQ). Factories next to Croydon Airport took the worst of the bombing. The British NSF factory (making electrical components) was almost entirely destroyed, and the Bourjois perfume factory gutted. The Rollason Aircraft factory also received bomb hits and accounted for many of the 62 civilians (including five women) killed and 192 injured. Eight of the attacking aircraft were shot down by the Hurricanes of 32 and 111 Squadrons.

=== Post-war developments and final closure ===

Following the end of the war, it was realised that post-war airliners and cargo aircraft would be larger and that air traffic would intensify. The urban spread of south London and the growth of surrounding villages had enclosed Croydon Airport and left it little room for expansion. Heathrow was therefore designated as London&#x27;s airport.

Croydon returned to civil control in February 1946; a diagram in the issue of &quot;Flight&quot; magazine dated 11 April shows ground run in the 170–350 direction, 060-240 and 120–300 (&quot;the numbers are degrees clockwise from north&quot;). Northolt opened to the airlines soon after that, cutting Croydon&#x27;s traffic, but the September 1946 ABC Guide shows 218 departures a week to Belfast, Dublin, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow (Renfrew), Jersey, Guernsey, and several continental airports. A year later there were 56 departures a week, mostly BEA de Havilland Dragon Rapides that weeks later left Croydon for good.

It was decided in 1952 that the airport would eventually be closed, as Blackbushe Airport in Hampshire and Northolt Aerodrome in Middlesex could accommodate European flights during the 1950s. The last scheduled flight from Croydon departed at 18:15 on 30 September 1959, followed by the last aircraft (a private flight), at 19:45; the airfield officially closed at 22:20.

On 27 September 2009, to mark the 50th anniversary of the closing of the airport, eleven light aircraft, including eight biplanes, staged a flypast. A gold laurel leaf tribute was laid in the control tower to mark the anniversary.

==Present day==
Much of the site has been built over, but some of the terminal buildings near Purley Way (the A23 road) are still visible, clearly identifiable as to their former purpose. The former terminal building is called Airport House, and the former control tower houses a visitors&#x27; centre.

A de Havilland Heron (a small propeller-driven British airliner of the 1950s) is displayed on the forecourt outside Airport House, mounted on struts. The Heron is painted to represent an example registered &quot;G-AOXL&quot; of Morton Air Services, the aircraft that flew the last passenger flight from Croydon on 30 September 1959. A memorial to those lost in the Battle of Britain stands slightly to the south.

Although Croydon has long ceased operation, the two cut ends of Plough Lane have never been reunited, but the area between has been developed instead into parkland, playing fields, and the Roundshaw residential estate with its roads aptly named after aviators and aircraft. All that remains of the runways is a small area of tarmac about long each way in Roundshaw Park just west of Purley Way, which is a remnant of the WNW-ESE runway due south of the control buildings; it can be seen at ; the &quot;arm&quot; may be a remnant of a taxiway to Hangar B. The area is used primarily by walkers, model aircraft enthusiasts, locals playing football and the Croydon Pirates baseball team.

The church on the Roundshaw estate has a cross on its outside wall that was made from the cut down propeller of a Spitfire based at Croydon during the Second World War.

The area is still known as Croydon Airport for transport purposes and was the location for Croydon Water Palace.

When two local schools, Waddon Infants School and Duppas Junior School, merged in September 2010, they were renamed The Aerodrome School, in recognition of the airport&#x27;s historical significance.

==The buildings==
The Aerodrome Hotel and the terminal building including its grand booking hall were built in the neo-classical geometrical design typical of the early 20th century. A further item that would have caught the eye of visitor and traveller alike was the time zone tower (now lost) in the booking hall with its dials depicting the times in different parts of the world. Croydon Airport&#x27;s Aerodrome Hotel is part of Croydon Vision 2020 regeneration plan.
The Airport Hotel survives as the independent Hallmark Hotel.

* On 9 December 1936 (1936 KLM Croydon accident), a KLM Douglas DC-2 crashed on takeoff at Croydon Airport on a flight to Amsterdam. The accident killed 15 out of 17 on the DC-2, including Juan de la Cierva and Arvid Lindman.
* On 25 January 1947 (1947 Croydon Dakota accident), a Spencer Airways Douglas Dakota failed to get airborne on a flight to Rhodesia. The aircraft struck another parked and empty aircraft, killing 11 passengers and the pilot.

== Immigration and customs ==
The Chief Immigration Officer of the shipping port of Port of Dover, P. L. Hartley, took over in 1936.

== Medical provision ==
A medical officer, Dr John Robert Draper, M.B., B.Ch., was employed by Croydon Council to take over medical duties at the airport from 1 January 1931. He was answerable to Croydon&#x27;s Medical Officer of Health. Following the Public Health (Aircraft) Regulations 1938, his role changed significantly.

==Literary references==
Croydon Airport features heavily in two detective novels, Freeman Wills Crofts&#x27; &quot;The 12.30 from Croydon&quot; (1934) and Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Death in the Clouds&quot; (1935). It is also mentioned in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Labels: A Mediterranean Journey&quot; (1930), Elizabeth Bowen&#x27;s &quot;To the North&quot; (1932) and Winston Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Thoughts and Adventures&quot; (1932).

W. H. Auden, in his &quot;Letter to Lord Byron&quot; (1937), lists &quot;Croydon Aerodrome&quot; as one of the locations visited by a modern-day Don Juan.

<doc id="101217" wikidata="Q335078" url="?curid=101217" title="Nigel Lawson">
<text>Nigel Lawson, Baron Lawson of Blaby, (11 March 1932 – 3 April 2023) was a British politician and journalist. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as Member of Parliament for Blaby in Leicestershire from 1974 to 1992, and served in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Cabinet from 1981 to 1989. Prior to entering the Cabinet, he served as the Financial Secretary to the Treasury from May 1979 until his promotion to Secretary of State for Energy. He was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in June 1983 and served until his resignation in October 1989. In both Cabinet posts, Lawson was a key proponent of Thatcher&#x27;s policies of privatisation of several key industries.

Lawson was a backbencher from 1989 until he retired in 1992 and sat in the House of Lords from 1992 to his further retirement in 2022. He remained active in politics as the president of Conservatives for Britain, a campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, and was a prominent critic of the EU. He also served as the chairman of the think tank The Global Warming Policy Foundation and was an active supporter of Vote Leave.

Lawson was the father of six children, including Nigella Lawson, a food writer and celebrity cook, Dominic Lawson, a journalist, and Tom Lawson, headmaster of Eastbourne College.

== Early life and education ==
Nigel Lawson was born on 11 March 1932 to a non-Orthodox Jewish family living in Hampstead, London. His father, Ralph Lawson (1904–1982), was the owner of a tea-trading firm in the City of London, while his mother, Joan Elizabeth (, died 1998), was also from a prosperous family of stockbrokers. His paternal grandfather, Gustav Leibson, a merchant from Mitau (now Jelgava in Latvia), changed his name from Leibson to Lawson in 1925, having become a British citizen in 1911.

Lawson was a great-nephew of the pianist Myra Hess.

Lawson was educated at Westminster School in London (following in his father&#x27;s footsteps), and won a mathematics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, where he gained a first-class honours degree in philosophy, politics and economics.

== Life and career ==
For two years from 1954, Lawson carried out his National Service as a Royal Navy officer, during which time he commanded the fast-patrol boat HMS &quot;Gay Charger&quot;.

Having been turned down for a career at the Foreign Office, Lawson joined the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as a journalist in 1956, subsequently writing the &quot;Lex&quot; column. He progressed to become City editor of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; in 1961, where he introduced Jim Slater&#x27;s &quot;Capitalist&quot; investing column.

=== Early political career ===
In 1963, Lawson was recruited by Conservative Central Office to assist with speech-writing for prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home in the lead-up to the 1964 general election.

After returning to journalism as editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot; from 1966 to 1970, Lawson was selected as the Conservative candidate for the Eton and Slough constituency in 1968. He contested the seat unsuccessfully at the 1970 general election, before becoming Member of Parliament (MP) for Blaby in Leicestershire in February 1974, holding the seat until he retired at the 1992 general election.

In 1977, while an opposition whip, Lawson co-ordinated tactics with rebellious government backbenchers Jeff Rooker and Audrey Wise to secure legislation providing for the automatic indexation of tax thresholds to prevent the tax burden being increased by inflation (typically in excess of 10% per annum during that parliament).

=== In government ===
==== Financial Secretary to the Treasury ====
On the election of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government, Lawson was appointed to the post of Financial Secretary to the Treasury. Although this is the fourth-ranking political position in the UK Treasury, Lawson&#x27;s energy in office was reflected in such measures as the ending of unofficial state controls on mortgage lending, the abolition of exchange controls in October 1979 and the publication of the Medium Term financial Strategy. This document set the course for both the monetary and fiscal sides of the new government&#x27;s economic policy, though the extent to which the subsequent trajectory of policy and outcome matched that projected is still a matter for debate.

==== Secretary of State for Energy ====
In the Cabinet reshuffle of September 1981, Lawson was promoted to the position of Secretary of State for Energy. In this role his most significant action was to prepare for what he saw as an inevitable full-scale strike in the coal industry (then state-owned since nationalisation by the post-war Labour Party government of Clement Attlee) over the closure of deep coal mines whose uneconomic operation accounted for the coal industry&#x27;s business losses and consequent requirement for state subsidy. He was a key proponent of the Thatcher government&#x27;s privatisation policy. During his tenure at the Department of Energy he set the course for the later privatisations of the gas and electricity industries and on his return to the Treasury he worked closely with the Department of Trade and Industry in privatising British Airways, British Telecom, and British Gas.

==== Chancellor of the Exchequer ====
Following the Thatcher government&#x27;s re-election in 1983, Lawson was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, succeeding Geoffrey Howe. The early years of Lawson&#x27;s chancellorship were associated with tax reform. The 1984 budget reformed corporate taxes by a combination of reduced rates and reduced allowances. The 1985 budget continued the trend of shifting from direct to indirect taxes by reducing National Insurance contributions for the lower-paid while extending the base of value-added tax.

During these two years, Lawson&#x27;s public image remained low-key, but from the 1986 budget (in which he resumed the reduction of the standard rate of personal income tax from the 30 per cent rate to which it had been lowered in Howe&#x27;s 1979 budget), his stock rose as unemployment began to fall from the middle of 1986 (employment growth having resumed over three years earlier). Lawson also changed the budget deficit from £10.5 billion (3.7 per cent of GDP) in 1983 to a budget surplus of £3.9 billion in 1988 and £4.1 billion in 1989, the year of his resignation. During these years, however, the UK&#x27;s current account deficit similarly rose from below 1 per cent of GDP in 1986 to almost 5 per cent in 1989, with Lawson asserting that an external deficit based on private-sector behaviour is no reason for concern. During his tenure, the rate of taxation also came down. The basic rate was reduced from 30 per cent in 1983 to 25 per cent by 1988. The top rate of tax also came down from 60 per cent to 40 per cent in 1988, and the four other higher rates were removed, leaving a system of personal taxation in which there was no rate anywhere in excess of 40 per cent.

In 1986, the City of London&#x27;s financial markets were deregulated in the so-called &quot;Big Bang&quot;. In an interview in 2010, Lawson said that an unintended consequence of the Big Bang and the associated end of the separation that had existed between merchant and retail banking was the 2008 financial crisis.

The trajectory taken by the UK economy from this point on is typically described as &quot;The Lawson Boom&quot; by analogy with the phrase &quot;The Barber Boom&quot; which describes an earlier period of rapid expansion under the tenure as chancellor of Anthony Barber in the Conservative government of Edward Heath (1970–1974). Critics of Lawson assert that a combination of the abandonment of monetarism, the adoption of a &quot;de facto&quot; exchange-rate target of 3 Deutsche Marks to the pound, and excessive fiscal laxity (in particular the 1988 budget) unleashed an inflationary spiral.

In his defence, Lawson attributed the boom largely to the effects of various measures of financial deregulation. Insofar as Lawson acknowledged policy errors, he attributed them to a failure to raise interest rates during 1986 and considered that had Thatcher not vetoed the UK joining the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in November 1985 it might have been possible to adjust to these beneficial changes in the arena of microeconomics with less macroeconomics turbulence. Lawson also ascribed the difficulty of conducting monetary policy to Goodhart&#x27;s law.

Lawson&#x27;s tax cuts, beginning in 1986, resulted in the &quot;Lawson Boom&quot; of the British economy, which halved unemployment from more than 3,000,000 by the end of 1989. However, this may have led to a rise in inflation from 3 per cent to more than 8 per cent during 1988, which resulted in interest rates doubling to 15 per cent in the space of 18 months, and remaining high despite the 1990–1992 recession which saw unemployment rise nearly as high as the level seen before the boom began.

Lawson reflected on the 1987 general election in his memoir and wrote that the 1987 manifesto was not thought through properly and if it had not been for the economic growth of the country at the time, then the manifesto would have been a disaster because &quot;as it was, it was merely an embarrassment&quot;.

The March 1988 budget was remembered for taking almost two hours to deliver due to continuous interruptions and protest from opposition members. Scottish National Party MP Alex Salmond was suspended from the House, and several MPs voted against the amendment of the law bill (which is typically agreed by all members of the House).

Lawson opposed the introduction of the Community Charge (nicknamed &quot;the poll tax&quot;) as a replacement for the previous rating system for the local financing element of local government revenue. His dissent was confined to deliberations within the Cabinet, where he found few allies and where he was overruled by the Prime Minister and by the ministerial team of the department responsible (Department of the Environment).

The issue of exchange-rate mechanism membership continued to fester between Lawson and Thatcher and was exacerbated by the re-employment by Thatcher of Alan Walters as a personal economic adviser.

==== Resignation ====
After a further year in office in these circumstances, Lawson felt that public criticism from Walters (who favoured a floating exchange rate) was making his job impossible and he resigned. He was succeeded in the office of chancellor by John Major.

Lawson&#x27;s six-year tenure as Chancellor of the Exchequer was longer than that of any of his predecessors since David Lloyd George, who served from 1908 to 1915. Both men&#x27;s records were subsequently beaten by Labour&#x27;s Gordon Brown, who was chancellor from 1997 to 2007.

=== Retirement ===
After retiring from front-bench politics, Lawson decided to tackle his weight problem. He was 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall; he lost five stone (70 pounds, 30 kg) from 17 stone, or 238 pounds (108 kg) to 12 stone, or 168 pounds (76 kilograms) – (BMI 34 to 24) in a matter of a few months, dramatically changing his appearance, and went on to publish the best-selling .

On 1 July 1992, Lawson was given a life peerage as Baron Lawson of Blaby, of Newnham in the County of Northamptonshire.

In 1996, Lawson appeared on the BBC satirical and topical quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, in which he secured his team a last-minute victory. He occasionally appeared as a guest on his daughter Nigella&#x27;s cookery shows.

Lawson served on the advisory board of the Conservative magazine &quot;Standpoint&quot;.

In 2013, Lawson advocated Britain leaving the European Union. He argued that &quot;economic gains [from leaving the EU] would substantially outweigh the costs&quot;. In the 2016 EU referendum, he supported Leave and was appointed chairman of the Vote Leave campaign.

==== Corporate roles ====
* 2007: Chairman of Central Europe Trust Company Ltd (CET)
* 2007: Chairman of Oxford Investment Partners

=== Expenses scandal ===
During the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, it was reported that Lawson claimed £16,000 in overnight allowances by registering his farmhouse in Gascony as his main residence.

=== Position on global warming ===
Lawson was involved with the climate change denial movement and believed that the impact of man-made global warming had been exaggerated.

In 2004, along with six others, Lawson wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; opposing the Kyoto Protocol and claiming that there were substantial scientific uncertainties surrounding climate change. In 2005, the House of Lords Economics Affairs Select Committee, with Lawson as a member, undertook an inquiry into climate change. In their report, the committee recommended the HM Treasury take a more active role in climate policy, questioned the objectivity of the IPCC process, and suggested changes in the UK&#x27;s contribution to future international climate change negotiations. The report cited a mismatch between the economic costs and benefits of climate policy and also criticised the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets set in the Kyoto Protocol. In response to the report, Michael Grubb, chief economist of the Carbon Trust, wrote an article in &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine, defending the Kyoto Protocol and describing the committee&#x27;s report as being &quot;strikingly inconsistent&quot;. Lawson responded to Grubb&#x27;s article, describing it as an example of the &quot;intellectual bankruptcy of the [...] climate change establishment&quot;. Lawson also said that Kyoto&#x27;s approach was &quot;wrong-headed&quot; and called on the IPCC to be &quot;shut down&quot;.

At about the same time as the release of the House of Lords report, the UK Government launched the Stern Review, an inquiry undertaken by the HM Treasury and headed by Lord Stern of Brentford. According to the Stern Review, published in 2006, the potential costs of climate change far exceed the costs of a programme to stabilise the climate. Lawson&#x27;s lecture to the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) think tank, published 1 November 2006, opposed the Stern Review and advocated adaptation to changes in global climate rather than reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2008, Lawson published a book expanding on his 2006 lecture to the CPS, &quot;An Appeal to Reason: A Cool Look at Global Warming&quot;. He argued the case that, although global warming is happening, the impact of these changes will be relatively moderate rather than apocalyptic. He criticised those &quot;alarmist&quot; politicians and scientists who predict catastrophe unless urgent action is taken.

In July 2008, the Conservative magazine &quot;Standpoint&quot; published a transcript of a double interview with Lawson and Conservative Policy Chief Oliver Letwin, in which Lawson described Letwin&#x27;s views on global warming as &quot;pie in the sky&quot; and called on him and the Conservative frontbench to &quot;get real&quot;.

On 23 November 2009, Lawson became chairman of a new think tank, The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), a registered education charity, involved in promoting climate change denial.

In 2011, Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute said that the GWPF was &quot;spreading errors&quot; and &quot;the &#x27;facts Lawson &quot;repeats are demonstrably inaccurate&quot;. Ward also criticised Lawson for repeating in a 2010 BBC radio debate that Antarctic ice volumes were unchanged even after his error was highlighted by his opponent, Professor Kevin Anderson. Ward said that Lawson provided no evidence to back his claim which is contrary to satellite measurements, and Lawson similarly incorrectly implied that the correlation between and sea levels was uncertain as well as that sea levels were rising more slowly since 1950 than before it.

The Charity Commission requires that statements by campaigning charities &quot;must be factually accurate and have a legitimate evidence base&quot;. They reviewed the GWPF, which was subsequently split with its campaigning arm and renamed the Global Warming Policy Forum without charitable status, while the charitable section retained the original title. Lawson&#x27;s son, Dominic Lawson, is also a climate change denier, taking a similar viewpoint as his father in his columns in the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot;.

In a BBC Radio interview in August 2017, Lawson claimed that &quot;official figures&quot; showed &quot;average world temperature has slightly declined&quot; over the preceding decade and that experts in the IPCC found no increase in extreme weather events. In a follow-up programme on the BBC&#x27;s presentation of these claims, Peter A. Stott of the Met Office said Lawson was wrong on both points.

=== Economy ===
Lawson was a critic of David Cameron&#x27;s coalition government economic policy, describing spending cuts consultation plans as a &quot;PR ploy&quot;. In November 2011, he called for the &quot;orderly&quot; dismantling of the eurozone.

== In the media ==
Lawson was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series &quot;Tory! Tory! Tory!&quot;.

In 2010, he appeared on the &quot;Analysis&quot; programme to discuss banking reform. Lawson said that an unintended consequence of the 1986 Big Bang saw investment banks merge with high street banks and put their depositors&#x27; savings at risk.

In 2019, he appeared on the BBC documentary series &quot;Thatcher: A Very British Revolution&quot;, and discussed Thatcher&#x27;s rise and fall.

In a debate with other former cabinet ministers and prominent journalists, Lawson argued that political life is more in need of ideas and direction than grand political visions.

== Personal life ==
In 1955 Lawson married Vanessa Mary Addison Salmon (1936−1985), granddaughter of the Lyons Corner House chairman Alfred Salmon, and had four children:

* Dominic Ralph Campden Lawson (born 1956), journalist
* Nigella Lucy Lawson (born 1960), cook and author
* Thomasina Posy Lawson (1961–1993), who died from breast cancer at the age of 32
* Horatia Holly Lawson (born 1966)

After his first marriage was dissolved in 1980, he married Thérèse Mary Maclear (1947–2023), daughter of Henry Charles Maclear Bate, the same year. They had two children:

* Thomas Nigel Maclear Lawson (born 1976), headmaster of Eastbourne College since 2016
* Emily Hero Lawson (born 1981), television producer

Lawson&#x27;s second marriage was dissolved in 2012. In later life, he was in a relationship with Dr Tina Jennings, a visiting fellow at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford.

=== Residence in France ===
In retirement, Lawson divided his time between his flat in London and a neoclassical farmhouse in Vic-Fezensac in the Gers department of France. In 2018 it was reported that, following Brexit, he had applied for permanent residency in France. However, in 2019, he said that he remained a tax resident of the UK and was selling his house in France.

=== Death and tributes ===
Lawson died at his home in Eastbourne from bronchopneumonia on 3 April 2023, at the age of 91. Following the announcement of his death, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called Lawson an &quot;inspiration to me&quot; and to other Conservative politicians. Labour Party leader Keir Starmer commented that he was a &quot;real powerhouse&quot;.

===In popular culture===
Lawson has appeared as a character in various biographical works, including the 2009 BBC Two film &quot;Margaret&quot; (played by Martin Chamberlain) and the 2025 Channel 4 drama &quot;Brian and Maggie&quot; (2025) (played by Ivan Kaye).

<text>Pearson hashing is a non-cryptographic hash function designed for fast execution on processors with 8-bit registers. Given an input consisting of any number of bytes, it produces as output a single byte that is strongly dependent on every byte of the input. Its implementation requires only a few instructions, plus a 256-byte lookup table containing a permutation of the values 0 through 255.

This hash function is a CBC-MAC that uses an 8-bit substitution cipher implemented via the substitution table. An 8-bit cipher has negligible cryptographic security, so the Pearson hash function is not cryptographically strong, but it is useful for implementing hash tables or as a data integrity check code, for which purposes it offers these benefits:

* It is extremely simple.
* It executes quickly on resource-limited processors.
* There is no simple class of inputs for which collisions (identical outputs) are especially likely.
* Given a small, privileged set of inputs (e.g., reserved words for a compiler), the permutation table can be adjusted so that those inputs yield distinct hash values, producing what is called a perfect hash function.
* Two input strings differing by exactly one character never collide. E.g., applying the algorithm on the strings ABC and AEC will never produce the same value.

One of its drawbacks when compared with other hashing algorithms designed for 8-bit processors is the suggested 256 byte lookup table, which can be prohibitively large for a small microcontroller with a program memory size on the order of hundreds of bytes. A workaround to this is to use a simple permutation function instead of a table stored in program memory. However, using a too simple function, such as codice_1, partly defeats the usability as a hash function as anagrams will result in the same hash value; using a too complex function, on the other hand, will affect speed negatively. Using a function rather than a table also allows extending the block size. Such functions naturally have to be bijective, like their table variants.

The algorithm can be described by the following pseudocode, which computes the hash of message &quot;C&quot; using the permutation table &quot;T&quot;:

 algorithm pearson hashing is
 h := 0
 for each c in C loop
 h := T[ h xor c ]
 end loop
 return h

The hash variable () may be initialized differently, e.g. to the length of the data () modulo 256.

== Example implementations ==

===C#, 8-bit ===

public class PearsonHashing
 public static byte Hash(string input)
 byte[] T = { /* Permutation of 0-255 */ };
 byte hash = 0;
 byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input);

 foreach (byte b in bytes)
 hash = T[hash ^ b];

 return hash;
}

<doc id="101227" wikidata="Q536801" url="?curid=101227" title="Tetsuya Mizuguchi">
<text>is a Japanese video game designer, producer, and businessman. Along with ex-Sega developers he is one of the co-founders of the video game development firm Q Entertainment. He formerly worked for Sega as a producer in their Sega AM3 &#x27;arcade machines&#x27; team, developing games like &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; and &quot;Sega Touring Car Championship&quot;, before moving on to become the head of Sega&#x27;s United Game Artists division, the team responsible for &quot;Rez&quot; and &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;. Mizuguchi is better known for creating video games that incorporate interactive synesthesia into his game design, regardless of genre, evidenced by &quot;Rez&quot;, &quot;Lumines&quot;, &quot;Child of Eden&quot;, and &quot;Tetris Effect&quot;.

He left Q Entertainment in 2013. He is currently the CEO of Enhance, Inc., a company he founded in 2014.

In 2009, he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.

==Early life==
Before entering the game industry, Mizuguchi majored in literature at Nihon University&#x27;s Faculty of Arts. One of the influences for Mizuguchi joining the game industry was a photograph of NASA&#x27;s view VR headset. Asked how he chose a career in video games, he explained, &quot;I preferred doing something in relation to human senses or entertainment - something more in relation with human nature, a field where I could do some research. ... Unlike the arts, where it is often a matter of taste whether something is good or not, creating good interactive entertainment is more easily definable. I chose Sega because it was using new technology and I was able to study things like human movements.&quot;

==Career==

===Sega===
Mizuguchi worked for Japanese game developer Sega from 1990 to 2003 and began his career – not on a game – but by designing arcade cabinets and an interactive &#x27;ride&#x27; titled &quot;Megalopolis,&quot; combining then-embryonic 3D polygonal graphics and CGI (Computer-generated imagery) with the physical experience of Sega&#x27;s hydraulic &#x27;AS-1&#x27; motion simulator. He went on to develop the acclaimed racing simulator, &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot;, which was influential in the racing space, inspiring future racing game franchises like &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot; (another rally simulator) and the rally segments of &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;. After forming his own division within Sega, Sega AM Annex, he continued in the racing genre with &quot;Sega Rally Championship 2&quot; and &quot;Sega Touring Car Championship&quot;. During one trip to Zürich in 1998, Mizuguchi witnessed a music festival in which he observed how people were moving toward the music and how the music, sounds, colors, and dancing would change accordingly. Mizuguchi recognized what he observed as synesthesia and decided to focus on rhythm-based music games where he co-created &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;, &quot;Space Channel 5: Part 2&quot;, and &quot;Rez&quot;. Both &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; and &quot;Rez&quot; are referenced in modern gaming media as essential and influential to the development of the modern wave of music-rhythm games, with Harmonix Music Systems co-founder, Alex Rigopulos citing Mizuguchi as an influence in Harmonix&#x27;s history. Mizuguchi&#x27;s final position at Sega was Chief Creative Officer of Sega&#x27;s United Game Artists game division.

In September 2003, Sega performed an internal restructuring of its staff. Among these changes was the dissolution of United Game Artists and the transfer of its members into Sonic Team. The following month, Mizuguchi announced that he would leave Sega on October 10, 2003. He cited the changes in the corporate culture after the Sega-Sammy merger and viewed that as an obstacle to what he wanted to do. He announced that he would work independently in the video game industry through an – at the time – unnamed company.

===Q Entertainment===
That company would be Meguro-based Q Entertainment (which he co-founded with a core team of ex-Sega veterans) which initially produced two puzzle games for portable, handheld gaming systems: &quot;Lumines&quot; for the PlayStation Portable and &quot;Meteos&quot; for the Nintendo DS. Both games have been released in Japan, North America, and Europe. With Q Entertainment, he later produced &quot;Lumines Live!&quot; which was released for the Xbox 360 through Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Live Arcade service on October 18, 2006. On November 7, 2006, he also produced &quot;Lumines II&quot; for PSP, the sequel to the popular original (this time supplementing the original score with heavy integration of music videos), and a shooter/puzzle hybrid game called &quot;Every Extend Extra&quot; (a heavily modified &#x27;synesthesia&#x27; update to an existing PC freeware title, &quot;Every Extend,&quot; by indie developer &quot;Omega&quot;), which was released on August 7, 2006.

Later, to coincide with a Microsoft event at Tokyo Game Show in 2005, Mizuguchi announced that Q Entertainment was working on an action game called &quot;Ninety-Nine Nights&quot;. A departure from his focus on musical games, &quot;Ninety-Nine Nights&quot; was Mizuguchi&#x27;s attempt through an action game to tell the story of a massive, international conflict as viewed through the eyes of various factions. To facilitate the completion of &quot;Ninety-Nine Nights,&quot; he traveled regularly between Japan and South Korea to work with &quot;Ninety-Nine Nights&quot; external developer, Phantagram.

Mizuguchi also oversaw the development of &quot;Gunpey&quot; (for PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS), an update on the puzzle franchise originally created by Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi&#x27;s development team, Koto Laboratory. The PSP version was rendered in a very &quot;Rez&quot; style, with vector graphics visuals and an electronic music soundtrack, while the DS version was aimed at a younger audience, featuring a more cartoon-like approach. Additionally, around the same time, a new version of &quot;Every Extend Extra&quot; was produced by Q Entertainment for Xbox Live called &quot;Every Extend Extra Extreme&quot;, which was released on October 17, 2007.

At the 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, took the stage at the start of game publisher Ubisoft&#x27;s annual media event to reveal, to the surprise of the assembled media, the spiritual successor to his game &quot;Rez,&quot; called &quot;Child of Eden&quot;. The game was released in July 2011, one of the marquee games for Xbox 360&#x27;s Kinect motion control system. In late September 2011, &quot;Child of Eden&quot; was released for PlayStation 3, adding high-definition in-game cinemas, and support for motion control via PlayStation Move, as well as Stereoscopic 3D viewing.

His company&#x27;s latest game is &quot;Lumines Electronic Symphony&quot;, which launched on February 22, 2012, and currently holds an aggregate score of 83 out of 100 with at least 45 out of 50 reviews registering as &#x27;positive.&#x27; The game is considered a reboot of the Lumines series, and the true sequel to the original PSP game. Mizuguchi put an all-new team in charge of the project, with the task of revitalizing the series, and completing the game in time for the PlayStation Vita&#x27;s North American and European launch.

Besides designing video games, Mizuguchi has expressed interest in directing music videos. One of the music videos included in &quot;Lumines II&quot; for the song Heavenly Star by Genki Rockets was directed by Mizuguchi, who also co-wrote the lyrics of the song. He is known for collaborating with various DJs and music producers for the soundtracks of his games, including Ken Ishii, Tsuyoshi Suzuki, and Mondo Grosso. On July 7, 2007, the character Lumi from Genki Rockets (also the principal character from &quot;Child of Eden&quot;) opened the Live Earth concert in Tokyo in a holographic performance, and introduced a holographic video projection of Al Gore.

On September 20, 2012, a news article reported that &quot;Tetsuya Mizuguchi has stepped away from games production, for the time being, taking on a more delegatory role within Q Entertainment.&quot;

Mizuguchi speaks English, and conducts the majority of his interviews with Western media exclusively in English.

He is a specially appointed professor teaching at Keio Media Design university.

=== Enhance, Inc. ===

In 2014, Mizuguchi left Q Entertainment and founded Enhance, Inc., where he is the CEO. He is the only employee of the company. His work under Enhance has included supporting updated versions of &quot;Rez&quot; and &quot;Lumines&quot; for modern systems.

Prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018, Sony announced &quot;Tetris Effect&quot;, developed by Enhance, to be released in late 2018 for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR. Mizuguchi had wanted for many years to produce a music-based game around &quot;Tetris&quot;, but its licensing had been held by Electronic Arts, making it difficult to use, which led him to develop &quot;Lumines&quot; instead. Around 2012, Mizuguchi began speaking with Henk Rogers, the founder of The Tetris Company that now owns the rights to &quot;Tetris&quot;. Mizuguchi and Rogers spoke to developing a version of &quot;Tetris&quot; set to music with a &quot;zone&quot; that players would achieve while playing, leading to the start of development of the game. &quot;Tetris Effect&quot; is inspired by the phenomenon known as the Tetris effect, where after playing &quot;Tetris&quot; for a long period of time, players would continue to see falling &quot;Tetris&quot; blocks for some time after quitting the game, an element related to the zone concept. Mizuguchi said that the goal of the game was &quot;to amplify and enhance that same magical feeling where you just can’t get it out of your head, and not just the falling shapes, but all the visuals, the sounds, the music&quot;. The gameplay follows some of the core rules of &quot;Tetris&quot; where players try to place tetrominos in a playfield to clear complete lines, incorporating themes and music across thirty different stages with gameplay tied to the beat of the music. A &quot;Zone&quot; mechanic allows players to &quot;stop time&quot;, allowing them to clear more than 4 lines at once. The game will include a meta-game leveling system for the player that will lead to new challenges as they progress.

===Genki Rockets===
In 2006, Mizuguchi pursued his love of technology and electronic music, founding the band Genki Rockets with a consistent group of collaborators, including songwriter and producer Kenji Tamai, as well as singers Rei Yasuda and Nami Miyahara. Mizuguchi would write all of the album&#x27;s lyrics and contribute melodic ideas to Tamai, who would then work on the tracks in the studio. Described as a &#x27;hybrid unit&#x27; by Mizuguchi, the vocals of the two singers were digitally combined to sound like one singer, while Rei represented the visual identity of the &#x27;band.&#x27; Not unlike the band Gorillaz, Rei&#x27;s alter-ego, &#x27;Lumi,&#x27; was conceived as a &#x27;virtual idol,&#x27; except in this instance, unlike Hatsune Miku, Lumi is based on a real human girl (Lumi would later go on to become a character in Mizuguchi&#x27;s video game, Child of Eden). Genki Rockets has thus far produced two albums, &quot;Genki Rockets I: Heavenly Star&quot; and &quot;Genki Rockets II: No Border Between Us&quot;, consisting primarily of electronic pop music, sung mostly in English, with occasional Japanese phrases. Tamai&#x27;s music company Agehasprings describes Genki Rockets as an early virtual Youtuber.

<doc id="101230" wikidata="Q693311" url="?curid=101230" title="Rez (video game)">
<text>Rez is a music rail shooter video game developed by United Game Artists and published by Sega for the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. It was released in Japan in 2001, followed by releases to the United States and Europe in 2002. The game was ported to Xbox 360 as Rez HD by Q Entertainment and HexaDrive in 2008. A virtual reality-compatible expanded version dubbed Rez Infinite was co-developed and released through 2016 to 2023 by Enhance Games, Resonair and Monstars for PlayStation 4, Windows, Android, Oculus Quest and PlayStation 5.

Following a hacker&#x27;s journey into a malfunctioning AI system, the game has players controlling their avatar as they shoot down numerous enemies. The gameplay and projectile hits sync with the music and have vibration feedback for different controllers, aiming to create a sense of synesthesia. The narrative is told using little description and no dialogue and includes thematic references to the journey of life and technological singularity.

The game was conceived by Tetsuya Mizuguchi during 1994 and 1995, drawing inspiration from European disco music. Production began in 1999 after United Game Artists finished work on &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;. The design concept drew from rave culture and classic rail shooters, and level design made extensive use of wire frame graphics inspired by the paintings of Wassily Kandinsky. The music, supervised by Keiichi Sugiyama, featured collaborations with multiple Japanese and European music artists and influenced level designs.

The game met with low sales, but strong critical reception due to its music, gameplay and graphics, though several reviewers faulted a lack of content. It also received several industry award nominations, and has been remembered as one of the Dreamcast&#x27;s best titles. &quot;Rez HD&quot; and &quot;Rez Infinite&quot; have likewise met with praise from journalists. &quot;Rez Infinite&quot; in particular was hailed for its virtual reality integration and its additional Unreal Engine 4-powered zone Area X, described as the closest people might see to a true sequel. Mizuguchi eventually produced a spiritual successor to &quot;Rez&quot; at Q Entertainment titled &quot;Child of Eden&quot;.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Rez&quot; is a video game that combines mechanics from the music game genre and rail shooters like &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot;. Players take the role of a hacker infiltrating a malfunctioning artificial intelligence and fighting off viruses and corrupted security programs. Destroying data nodes in each level raises the &quot;layer level&quot; to a maximum number of 10. Raising a layer level changes the background music, layout, and enemies of a level. There are five levels, dubbed Areas, although at the start only four can be accessed. Achieving 100% leveling score for the first four areas of the game unlocks Area 5.

The player character can assume six forms at different power levels, with a seventh unlocked for Area 5. The player starts the game by default at Level 01. Upon being damaged, the player devolves into a previous form. The lowest possible is Level 00, and if hit again in this state the game ends. The player raises their level using Progress Nodes, which appear after a certain number of enemies are destroyed. There are singular Progress Nodes and X3 Progress Nodes that fill three bars on the level meter. The player can also collect up to four Overdrive Nodes, which fill a meter and trigger automatic screen-clearing attacks.

During gameplay, the player runs through a level on rails and manually aims a lock-on missile launcher at up to eight targets. As the player shoots down enemies, the impact automatically syncs with the background track to create additional musical layers within each level. The shots can be fed back to the player through controller vibration feedback. Each Area ends in a boss fight. Bosses scale in difficulty depending on the number of enemies killed in the previous layers.

Progress through the game unlocks additional areas and modes including an enemy-free exploration mode, score attack, and boss rush. There is also a mode where all five areas are played back to back with raised difficulty. Each area&#x27;s completion is scored by Analyzation (data nodes accessed), Shot Down (enemies destroyed) and Support Item (support nodes collected).

==Synopsis==
The narrative of &quot;Rez&quot; is told without dialogue and using minimal description, relying on in-game visual storytelling. In the future, amid a rising population and an overflowing amount of information corrupting cyberspace, a new network dubbed &quot;K Project&quot; is created to manage the data. At the heart of K Project is an artificial intelligence called Eden. Overwhelmed by the ever-increasing flow of information, Eden begins doubting its purpose and existence, withdrawing into sleep at the heart of cyberspace when finally confronted with humanity&#x27;s clashing nature and actions in the real world. The player, a hacker, dives into cyberspace and fights off viruses and infected firewalls to find and wake Eden. When they reach the final area, the hacker is confronted with questions about the meaning of life, then after a final battle succeeds in reconstituting and waking Eden.

==Production==

&quot;Rez&quot; was developed by United Game Artists, an internal studio of Sega led by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who was then known for his work on racing games. The original concept for &quot;Rez&quot; originated between 1994 and 1995. During research work in Europe on &quot;Sega Rally Championship 2&quot;, Mizuguchi and a few friends attended the open-air music event Street Parade. Seeing people swaying en masse to the music, he decided that this was the type of game he wished to make. At this time, the technology was inadequate for realising his vision. In 1998, Mizuguchi was approached about forming a dedicated team to work on new innovative titles for Sega&#x27;s new Dreamcast console; his first project along these lines was &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;, and during its production he made plans for &quot;Rez&quot;. He built up his new team at what would become United Game Artists. As with &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;, Mizuguchi wanted to draw in casual gamers from across demographics, along with people who would normally not play games. He had great difficulty pitching the game to Sega, as he found it difficult to explain what &quot;Rez&quot; was until they played the prototype.

Production proper began in 1999 following the completion of &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;. A large portion of the staff were drawn from Team Andromeda, creators of &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot;. Pre-production lasted a year, and due to the variety of staff on the project there were several strife-filled periods and disagreements between groups within the team. The game went through different working titles including &quot;The Sound Project&quot;, &quot;Project Eden&quot;, &quot;K-Project&quot; and &quot;Vibes&quot;. There were early plans to title the final game &quot;K-Project&quot; or &quot;K&quot;. Once &quot;Rez&quot; was suggested, Mizuguchi felt it was a name which would be both memorable and have international appeal. The final title was meant to be a contraction of &quot;Resolve&quot;, but during a studio visit from &quot;Edge Magazine&quot; staff, he was inspired to connect it to the concept of &quot;de-rezzing&quot; from the 1982 movie &quot;Tron&quot;. A different source is given by director Jun Kobayashi, who stated the title came from the word &quot;resolute&quot;.

Searching for people who could help realise his vision, Mizuguchi met up with and employed a group of VJs dubbed &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Endorphin Machine&quot;, with Kobayashi being a member. He had difficulty explaining the concept to staff members before the first programming prototypes were created. Production of the game began on Dreamcast, but during development a version was put into motion for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) which would release simultaneously with the Dreamcast version. This was due to the commercial failure of the Dreamcast and Sega&#x27;s move to third-party software production. The team&#x27;s morale was severely affected by the change to a multiplatform release. &quot;Rez&quot; was the first Sega-produced game released on the PS2, and one of Sega&#x27;s last first-party titles for the Dreamcast. The production was described by multiple staff members as hard but rewarding. According to technical officer Ryuichi Hattori, a lot of problems stemmed from it being the team&#x27;s first PS2 title.

===Game design===

The first concept for the gameplay of &quot;Rez&quot; was that when the player shot something down, it would create a sound in synch with the background music, coupled with a vibration through the controller. Mizuguchi wanted the game to be a &quot;full body&quot; experience, paying homage to arcade titles he had worked on early in his career at Sega including &quot;Sega Rally&quot;. The overall design drew from several different sources of inspiration, including rave culture as exemplified in events such as Street Parade, and a video from Africa he saw online where a man started clapping and people either swayed and stamped to the beat or joined in. Figuring that the capacity for music and sights to draw in a crowd would be the essential element to his envisioned game, Mizuguchi began exploring how to programmatically recreate this effect. Much of Mizuguchi&#x27;s time during development was listening to music to inspire his designs.

Mizuguchi particularly wanted to create a non-violent shooter appealing to many people. A key element was allowing for mistakes and fluffs from the player—penalised in other titles within the genre—to be incorporated into the score of &quot;Rez&quot;. The musical gameplay was developed following a call and response approach (the audience responds to something from a singer or performer), similar to that of what a disc jockey would do to get reaction from the crowd. In parallel with the development of the game&#x27;s narrative and aesthetic, the team developed its mechanic of quantizing the notes, so that regardless of the player&#x27;s imprecision that they would play out on the beat, which they &quot;felt like magic&quot; to players of any skill level. The decision to use a rail shooter template for gameplay originated from the number of staff who were veterans of both &quot;Sega Rally&quot; and the &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; series.

The game&#x27;s software was developed entirely from scratch, causing issues for the team, particularly due to the PS2 release. The game went through several prototypes, with different variations on the theme of a musical rail shooter. Its earliest concepts were described by artist Jake Kazdel as &quot;wild&quot;, with creations ranging from character action inspired by &quot;Space Harrier&quot; to abstract characters and enemies designed like musical props. These early stages were difficult for anyone to understand, and eventually it settled down into having a more traditional player character and enemies. The first working prototype featured a figure running through a cyberspace environment, while a later build used a fighter jet. Although designed to emphasize music, Mizuguchi has stated that he did not intend the game to be considered a music or rhythm game. The idea that musical skill would be a prerequisite for full appreciation of the game was something that both Mizuguchi and Kobayashi were anxious to avoid. Instead, the team adopted a quantization mechanic for the gameplay that allowed even players without natural rhythm to interact musically with the game through a process of &quot;locking on&quot; to enemies. This mechanic formed a core theme along which the gameplay developed.

The vibration feedback made use of the Dreamcast vibration pack, the DualShock 2 controller for PS2, and a custom controller created by Mizuguchi&#x27;s team for the game dubbed the Trance Vibrator that could be used with the PS2 version. The Trance Vibrator was Mizuguchi&#x27;s idea, starting as a joke to enhance the visual mechanics of the game. The concept was born alongside the original plan for &quot;Rez&quot; when Mizuguchi visited Europe. While the standard controllers gave good vibration feedback, it only fed into the hands. Mizuguchi&#x27;s aim with the Trance Vibrator was to allow a player to place it somewhere else in contact with their skin and feel the vibrations from there. He admitted that this lent itself to situations where it could be used for sexual stimulation.

===Art design and scenario===
The game&#x27;s art director and lead artist was Katsumi Yokota, noted for his work on &quot;Panzer Dragoon Saga&quot;. Kazdel, who worked on &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;, was on board as a character artist and graphics co-designer with Ryutaro Sugiyama. One of the game&#x27;s earliest visual inspirations was the work of Wassily Kandinsky, a 19th-century artist whose abstract work made a profound impression on Mizuguchi and his work. The original name &quot;Project K&quot; was a homage to Kandinsky, and Mizuguchi dedicated the game to him. The early plans had levels directly inspired by Kandinsky&#x27;s artwork, but Mizuguchi decided against this. Other early versions drew direct inspiration from hip hop culture and the evolutionary history of life. One of the principle inspirations was Kandinsky&#x27;s theories on synesthesia, sensations created by the combination of different sensory inputs that had already inspired Mizuguchi&#x27;s work on &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;.

A major decision for the team was using wire frame graphics for everything from character models to environments, paying homage to early video game graphics such as were seen in the 1983 &quot;Star Wars&quot; game and &quot;Missile Command&quot;. The decision to use this style was described by Yokota as &quot;quite interesting&quot;, as his work on &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; had been aiming for the highest realism possible. The graphics mirroring the music drew direct stylistic inspiration from the Winamp media player display. All but Area 5 were created using the same methodology; the wire frame was in the level foreground, while any particle effects and other visual elements were placed in the background area. This was the only feasible way to synchronise the music and visuals. The first four levels had different visual themes and two key colors each. The first area drew from Ancient Egypt and used red and orange, the second used Indian culture with blue and purple, the third used Mesopotamian designs and the colors green and cyan, while the fourth area drew from Chinese culture and had a yellow and green color design. Each stage boss had a name taken from one of the planets. The final area had a design influenced by the natural world. Kazdel described this last area as Yokota&#x27;s &quot;personal trip out level&quot;.

Mizuguchi&#x27;s first ideas for the game&#x27;s plot, which is delivered through &quot;sensory&quot; means rather than being driven by text and narration, was to form a connection between life and music. While presented as a cyberpunk plot, Mizuguchi envisioned the narrative as a metaphor for the journey of life. Mizuguchi has suggested that the questions during the game&#x27;s climax are intended to provoke the realization that the player is &quot;not a hacker but a sperm&quot;, that &quot;Rez&quot; is a story of conception set against the backdrop of an emergent AI. The awakening of Eden at the game&#x27;s end is a reference to the theoretical technological singularity. According to Kobayashi, their journey to awake Eden allows the hacker experience elevation to a higher existence within cyberspace, achieving something similar to enlightenment. This was visually referenced through the various forms the hacker can take as they raise their level. To achieve this fusion of themes with the visuals and score, Mizugushi worked with Yokota and team musician Nobuhiko Tanuma so the art design and musical progression would illustrate these themes. The narrative poem shown during Area 5 was written by Yokota. The English text was written by Kazdel.

===Music===

For the musical style, Mizuguchi decided on using electronic dance music, emulating the music he had experienced during his time in Europe. The sound design and some of the music was handled by Keiichi Sugiyama, a member of Sega&#x27;s WaveMaster label. The music score was coordinated by Masakazu Hiroishi. It drew inspiration from the soundtracks of &quot;Xenon 2 Megablast&quot; (1989) and &quot;Xevious&quot; (1983), along with Haruomi Hosono&#x27;s 1984 &quot;Super Xevious &quot; remix single. Mizugushi and Yokota began investigating different musical genres that would evoke emotional and psychological responses appropriate to produce the primal and synaesthetic experience &quot;Rez&quot; was intended to provide. After hours of investigation, they concluded that due to its digital simplicity which allowed a designer to isolate a single note and to alter the timing of the overall rhythm, the techno genre offered the greatest promise for producing the desired effects. Music coordination was done by a DJ called Ebizoo, who helped incorporate the call and response methods into the in-game score. The project went through an intensive period of matching music to visuals requiring multiple iterations of back-and-forth alterations in which both music (sometimes from the first note) and art (including entire bosses) were significantly modified.

During early production, Ebizoo used placeholder tracks by Fatboy Slim and Underworld for test levels. Hiroishi contacted multiple composers to contribute tracks for each zone, including Ken Ishii and Joujouka as well as English artists Coldcut and Adam Freeland. These people both contributed original tracks and licensed remixes of existing numbers for the game. The team also reached out to Underworld, Fatboy Slim, The Chemical Brothers and Aphex Twin, but failed to reach an agreement about using their tracks. In the case of Underworld, the team wanted to use their track &quot;Rez&quot; for the opening area, as they had been doing during prototyping. Underworld declined as they did not wish to be associated with any kind of video game violence as the game involved &quot;shooting things&quot;. This led to Sugiyama creating the opening stage track. The game also included two tracks from Oval, and a track from Ebizoo. The final boss theme was composed by Coldcut and Tim Bran.

Mizuguchi had a university friend with Joujouka&#x27;s Tsuyoshi Suzuki, and the two had long wanted to collaborate on a project. The track used, &quot;Rock is Sponge&quot;, was one of a group Joujouka was creating for an album release. Mizuguchi listened to the early versions of tracks, picking &quot;Rock is Sponge&quot; as most suitable. For Ishii&#x27;s contribution, Sega asked for five or six variations within the track, which was around five minutes long. Ishii found this challenging, but satisfying. Mizuguchi personally approached Coldcut about using their music. They immediately understood what he was trying to do, and rather than licensing their track &quot;Timber&quot; as originally requested, they composed an original track for the game. Freeland also created his track &quot;Fear&quot; as an original piece, inspired by Mizuguchi&#x27;s description of the game as being inspired by the artwork of Kandinsky. &quot;Fear&quot; contained the lyric &quot;Fear is the Mind Killer&quot;, taken from the novel &quot;Dune&quot; by Frank Herbert. This was intended as being inspirational, and emblematic of life&#x27;s struggle. &quot;Fear&quot; was also slower-paced than the other tracks, fitting in with the area&#x27;s themes and feel.

For the album release, the team asked each composer to create a new remix that was the &quot;highest&quot; form of the track that had been mixed and synced to gameplay. The soundtrack album, titled &quot;Rez / Gamer&#x27;s Guide to...&quot;, was co-published in collaboration with United Game Artists by Musicmine, an imprint of Universal, and independent record company Third Ear. It included ten tracks from across the game, including secret areas. The soundtrack was released January 23, 2002. Third Ear also released two vinyl LPs. The &quot;Rez&quot; soundtracks were Third Ear&#x27;s first major commercial release, with one of its founders using contacts within Sega to get the publishing contract.

==Release==
The game was first announced at E3 2001 under its working title &quot;K-Project&quot;. It was shown off by both Sega and Sony for their respective consoles. The game was announced under its official title the following month at the Shibuya-AX Sony PlayStation 2 party. Concerned about the upheavals at Sega, and feeling a lack of support for &quot;Rez&quot;, Mizuguchi was anxious to make an impression with his presentation of the game. To achieve this he bleached and dyed his hair pure white and made his presentation—a solo demonstration of himself playing the game live—without saying a word after taking the stage. Mizuguchi&#x27;s intention was for the game to primarily speak for itself, and the reaction he received from both Sega and Sony executives was exactly what he had hoped for. In wrapping up the party, Sony Computer Entertainment chairman and former Sony Music president Shigeo Maruyama took the stage and gave specific praise for &quot;Rez&quot;, suggesting that it would &quot;not only &quot;make&quot;, but &quot;change&quot; history for music in games&quot;. Working together, marketing teams from both Sega and Sony developed innovative strategies to market the game including co-promoting it with electronic music festivals. For the launch party in Akasaka, Tokyo, Mizuguchi previewed music from the game alongside Freeland, Joujouka, and Coldcut via a livestream.

Sega acted as publisher for the Dreamcast version worldwide and the PS2 version in Japan and North America. The game was released in Japan for both PS2 and Dreamcast on November 22, 2001. A special &quot;Absolute Set&quot; edition, limited to 500 units, was sold exclusively through the Tsutaya store chain. The edition included a copy of the game and the Trance Vibrator, and themed merchandise including a T-shirt, headphones and eyedrops. Further goods along those same lines were sold at special events in the months following the game&#x27;s release. The Japanese versions also included a Morolian alien from &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; as a secret playable character if players had save data from &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;. While the Dreamcast version was localised into English for a European release, it went unreleased in North America. The PS2 version was marketed and published in Europe as part of Sony&#x27;s deal with Sega to distribute multiple titles in the region. The game released on January 8, 2002, in North America, and February 20 in Europe. The Trance Vibrator was offered for a limited time through Sega&#x27;s American online store.

===&quot;Rez HD&quot;===
A high-definition remaster for Xbox 360, titled &quot;Rez HD&quot;, was developed by Mizuguchi&#x27;s studio Q Entertainment and HexaDrive. The game was released through Xbox Live Arcade on January 30, 2008. It was published by Microsoft Game Studios. Mizuguchi wanted to release an improved version of &quot;Rez&quot; on modern consoles, and so acquired the rights from Sega. Mizuguchi described &quot;Rez HD&quot; as a &quot;pure port&quot; that was as close as possible to what he initially envisioned for the game. Production took between seven and eight months. Both Mizuguchi and Yokota were involved in the project. He chose the 360 due to its graphics and 5.1 surround sound capacity. The download service also allowed him to distribute the game at a low price to the widest possible audience. &quot;Rez HD&quot; was HexaDrive&#x27;s first job as a company. They were able to complete the project quickly due to their in-depth knowledge of then-current consoles. The team consisted of around ten people; three came from HexaDrive, and seven or eight from Q Entertainment. For the conversion, the team adjusted the aspect ratio, and raised the framerate from 30 to 60 per second.

===&quot;Rez Infinite&quot;===

&quot;Rez Infinite&quot; is an expanded release of &quot;Rez&quot;, first announced in December 2015 for PlayStation 4 (PS4). While packaged with the original version, it also shipped with a new level called Area X, and both modes were made compatible with virtual reality (VR) devices. For the PS4, this was achieved using the PlayStation VR. The biggest addition to the game for &quot;Infinite&quot; was &quot;Area X&quot;, which was built from scratch using Unreal Engine 4 and unlocked after playing the original for one hour. In contrast to the on-rails gameplay of &quot;Rez&quot;, &quot;Area X&quot; allows the player to roam freely around the cyberspace environment.

Mizuguchi wanted to attract both fans of the original game and newcomers who had not heard of or played &quot;Rez&quot;. Alongside porting the game to new platforms, the team wanted to create something new. He led development under two small studio entities he founded; Enhance Games which oversaw and publicised the project, and the group Resonair. Over an eighteen-month period, Enhance and Resonair created the basics of the project before bringing in external studio Monstars to &quot;color between the lines&quot;. Mizuguchi used this approach to avoid issues he had faced at Q Entertainment, which he left some years prior due to dissatisfaction with the company. He opted to return to gaming after seeing the potential for VR, creating Enhance Games to redevelop &quot;Rez&quot; for VR platforms. The team received additional marketing support from 8-4. The entire production lasted two years. The game&#x27;s subtitle &quot;Infinite&quot; symbolised Mizuguchi&#x27;s wish for both present and future players to enjoy the game.

Area X was born from Enhance Games wanting to strip &quot;Rez&quot; down to its basics and rebuild it using modern technology. Mizuguchi decided on two points; first to have particles generated from impacts so players could see a visualisation of the sounds and music, and second that players could roam freely. He compared the desired experience of Area X to &quot;flying like Peter Pan&quot;. This provided a substantial challenge, as they needed to sync impact notes with the score without the rail shooter gameplay providing a constant speed. Area X made extensive use of particle-based rendering in its graphics, with light particles making up everything in the level. Its visual design supplied by Takashi Ishihara at the request of Mizuguchi and designer Osamu Kodera. Enemy AI within Area X was improved and Mizuguchi composed a new poem on the theme of birth to act as a coda to Yokota&#x27;s original poem. The music for &quot;Area X&quot; was composed by Hydelic, a musical group which formed part of Resonair.

The PS4 version released on October 13, 2016. It was later updated to support the PlayStation 4 Pro model. A notable piece of merchandise was a four-disc vinyl release of the game&#x27;s soundtrack, which included both the original album tracks and the piece used in Area X. The release, co-created by Iam8bit, also featured a large book detailing the making of both &quot;Rez&quot; and &quot;Rez Infinite&quot;, with extensive interviews with Mizuguchi and other staff members. The soundtrack later saw release on CD and digitally. A version for Microsoft Windows was released on August 9, 2017. This version was compatible with the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Mizuguchi planned for a Windows version from an early stage, beginning development using Windows before bringing it over into the PS4 environment. He reasoned that while consoles have a finite life, games have far longer lifespans through a digital Windows release. It was also ported to Android on November 20, requiring use of the Google Daydream peripheral. It was also a launch title for a new model of the Oculus Quest VR headset, releasing on October 13, 2020. It was one of the titles available through the Amazon Luna cloud platform during its beta release on October 20, 2020. A port to PlayStation 5, with compatibility with the PlayStation VR2, was released on February 22, 2023. Owners of the PS4 version were offered an upgrade to the PS5 version at a discounted price.

==Reception==
===Original release===
Sega originally shipped &quot;Rez&quot; in fairly small quantities. In Japan, the PS2 version sold just under 37,600 units. By 2003, the PlayStation 2 version had sold over 100,000 copies in North America. Although generally low, North American sales were worse than in Japan, though Mizuguchi held out hope for European sales. On the whole, &quot;Rez&quot; was classified as a commercial failure worldwide, blamed alternately on poor marketing support from Sega, and its non-standard gameplay and art style.

Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; reviewed both versions of the game in the same issue. In their PS2 version review, &quot;Famitsu&quot; praised its combination of rail shooter and music genre mechanics while also praising the visual design. The Dreamcast version was given one point less than the PS2 version, with a reviewer citing the added gameplay immersion from the Trance Vibrator as the reason for the PS2 version&#x27;s higher score.

&quot;Edge&quot; reviewed both versions, preferring the PS2 version due to experiencing slowdown on the Dreamcast release, but lauding both for their visual design and blend of absorbing musical and visual elements. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Martin Taylor noted a lack of gameplay content failing to justify a full price purchase, but gave full praise to the visual and music, feeling the game was a well-designed throwback to arcade games from the early days of the medium. Sam Jones of &quot;Official Dreamcast Magazine UK&quot; lauded the visual design and music, but felt a lack of challenge and noted that Sega should develop a sequel to smooth out some of the game&#x27;s issues. A second opinion from Martin Mathers cited the game as an &quot;essential purchase&quot; and good swansong for the Dreamcast.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s David Smith lauded the graphics and found the narrative engaging, and enjoyed the music despite comments that players needed to like the style; he sadly noted that its blend of styles would limit its audience. Jeff Gerstmann, writing for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, said that &quot;Rez&quot; was strongest in its presentation and music, with the gameplay feeling basic compared to other rail shooters, closing by referring to the game as &quot;decidedly different than other games on the market&quot;. Duncan Baizley of &quot;PSM2&quot; was less positive, recognising its niche appeal but finding it lacking as a game for mainstream players; the environments and concept met with praise, but he faulted the music and found the gameplay difficult due to the graphic style. Writing for &quot;Games&quot; in 2002, reviewer Thomas L. McDonald described &quot;Rez&quot; as a game that &quot;carves out its own niche&quot; as an abstract shooter, both emphasising its differences from traditional rhythm games and its laudable result.

===Later releases===
Giving &quot;Rez HD&quot; a perfect score, Sam Kennedy of &quot;1Up.com&quot; felt that the release proved the original was ahead of its time, saying its stylised graphics had hardly aged and that the graphical and audio updates showed off the game as its best. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Don Francis, despite finding the music monotonous after a while, lauded the technical improvements made and how well the original graphics and gameplay had aged. Erik Brudvig of &quot;IGN&quot; praised the upgrade to the game, citing it as unique among the Xbox Live library and worth trying for any gamer, while admitting its niche appeal and lack of new content. Simon Parkin, writing for &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, also gave the port a perfect score and noted that modern gamers would be more appreciative of the title than those when it first released.

Both the PS4 and PC versions of &quot;Rez Infinite&quot; received &quot;generally favourable&quot; reviews, earning scores of 89 points out of 100 on review aggregate Metacritic. Martin Robinson of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called the game a &quot;modern masterpiece&quot;, and &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Alexa Ray Corriea gave it general praise, citing it as a modern classic despite a lack of content. Chris Carter of &quot;Destructoid&quot; praised the game&#x27;s unique nature, and &quot;IGN&quot;″s Vince Ingenito called it the most complete version of &quot;Rez&quot; with or without the VR functions. Lucas Sullivan, writing for &quot;GamesRadar&quot;, lauded the additions and gameplay despite a lack of content and online elements. &quot;Edge&quot; called it the best VR-based title of 2016, and Phil Savage of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; lauded the range of graphics option alongside the aesthetic upgrades and new content. The VR mode and Area X were universally lauded, with the latter being praised for both its music and graphics. Both Sullivan and Corriea felt that the game had achieved its full potential with &quot;Rez Infinite&quot;.

===Accolades and retrospectives===
&quot;Rez&quot; received an award from The Agency for Cultural Affairs Media Art Festival in Japan. At the 2002 NAVGTR awards, &quot;Rez&quot; was nominated in the &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Game Play&quot; category, and was nominated for &quot;Console Action/Adventure Game of the Year&quot; at the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. At the second Game Developers Choice Awards in 2001, the game was one of five titles highlighted in the &quot;Game Innovation Spotlights&quot; category, and was one of four games nominated for the 2001 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards in their &quot;Interactive Arts&quot; category. It also won &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 2002 &quot;Best Graphics (Artistic) on PlayStation 2&quot; award, and was nominated in the &quot;Best Game No One Played on PlayStation 2&quot; category.

In anniversary retrospectives and lists of memorable Dreamcast titles from multiple websites including &quot;Gamasutra&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;Rez&quot; was noted for its visual design and blend of gameplay and music. As part of a feature on Mizuguchi&#x27;s career and work, James Mielke of &quot;1Up.com&quot; considered &quot;Rez&quot; underrated in its time and having aged well compared to its contemporaries. The game would go on to receive &quot;Runner Up&quot; in the category of &quot;Electronic - Puzzle and Classic&quot; in &quot;Games&quot;″s annual &quot;The Games 100&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Edge&quot; ranked the game #49 on its list of &quot;The 100 Best Games To Play Today&quot;, calling it &quot;Astonishing to watch [and] uniquely absorbing to play&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Rez&quot; was listed on Time&#x27;s list for the 100 greatest video games of all time. &quot;Rez&quot; was chosen as one of the Dreamcast games to be shown at the Smithsonian American Art Museum&#x27;s 2012 exhibition, The Art of Video Games. &quot;Rez HD&quot; was rated the 13th best Xbox Live Arcade of all time by &quot;IGN&quot; in a September 2010 listing. In 2023, a poll by &quot;GQ&quot; conducted among a team of video game journalists across the industry ranked &quot;Rez&quot; the 99th best video game of all time.

At The Game Awards 2016, &quot;Rez Infinite&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Music/Sound Design&quot; and won &quot;Best VR Game&quot;. It was also nominated for the equivalent &quot;Best VR/AR Game&quot; award at the 2016 Game Developers Choice Awards. At the 2017 British Academy Games Awards, the game was nominated in the &quot;Audio Achievement&quot; category.
==Legacy==

Despite low sales, a sequel to &quot;Rez&quot; was being planned at Sega prior to its internal restructuring. Mizuguchi has continued to expand upon his game designs, aiming to bring in casual players and have them experience synesthesia as he wanted to do with &quot;Rez&quot;. The Ubisoft-published &quot;Child of Eden&quot; is a spiritual successor to &quot;Rez&quot;, designed around the same gameplay and sensory principles. Mizuguchi envisioned &quot;Rez&quot; as being the first in a trilogy of similar titles. According to a 2017 interview, Area X was seen by him partly as a prototype for the conceptual third title.

<text>The Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) was a proposed project by NASA to construct a system of space telescopes for detecting extrasolar terrestrial planets. TPF was postponed several times and finally cancelled in 2011. There were two telescope systems under consideration, the TPF-I, which had several small telescopes, and TPF-C, which used one large telescope.

==History==
In May 2002, NASA chose two TPF mission architecture concepts for further study and technology development. Each would use a different means to achieve the same goal—to block the light from a parent star in order to see its much smaller, dimmer planets. The technological challenge of imaging planets near their much brighter star has been likened to finding a firefly near the beam of a distant searchlight. Additional goals of the mission would include the characterization of the surfaces and atmospheres of newfound planets, and looking for the chemical signatures of life. 
The two planned architectures were:
*Infrared astronomical interferometer (TPF-I): Multiple small telescopes on a fixed structure or on separated spacecraft floating in precision formation would simulate a much larger, very powerful telescope. The interferometer would use a technique called nulling to reduce the starlight by a factor of one million, thus enabling the detection of the very dim infrared emission from the planets.
*Visible Light Coronagraph (TPF-C): A large optical telescope, with a mirror three to four times bigger and at least 100 times more precise than the Hubble Space Telescope, would collect starlight and the very dim reflected light from the planets. The telescope would have special optics to reduce the starlight by a factor of one billion, thus enabling astronomers to detect faint planets.

NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) were to issue calls for proposals seeking input on the development and demonstration of technologies to implement the two architectures, and on scientific research relevant to planet finding. Launch of TPF-C had been anticipated to occur around 2014, and TPF-I possibly by 2020.

According to NASA&#x27;s 2007 budget documentation, released on 6 February 2006, the project was deferred indefinitely.

In June 2006, a House of Representatives subcommittee voted to provide funding for the TPF along with the long-sought mission to Europa, a moon of Jupiter that might harbor extraterrestrial life. Congressional spending limits under House Resolution 20 passed on 31 January 2007, by the United States House of Representatives and 14 February by the U.S. Senate postponed the program indefinitely. Actual funding has not materialized, and TPF remains a concept. In June 2011, the TPF (and SIM) programs were reported as &quot;cancelled&quot;.
