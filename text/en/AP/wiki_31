<text>Gerald Vincent Bull (March 9, 1928 – March 22, 1990) was a Canadian engineer who developed long-range artillery. He moved from project to project in his quest to economically launch a satellite using a huge artillery piece, to which end he designed the Project Babylon &quot;supergun&quot; for Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government in Iraq.

Bull was assassinated outside his apartment in Brussels, Belgium, in March 1990. His assassination is believed to be the work of the Mossad over his work for the Iraqi government. No person has ever been charged with the murder of Bull.

==Early life==
Gerald Vincent Bull was born in North Bay, Ontario, Canada, to George L. Toussaint Bull, a solicitor, and Gertrude Isabelle (née LaBrosse) Bull. George Bull was from a family from the Trenton area and had moved to North Bay in 1903 to start a law firm. As a Roman Catholic, LaBrosse would have been forbidden from marrying Bull, an Anglican. George converted to Roman Catholicism on February 20, 1909, and the two married three days later. The couple had 10 children.

George Bull was offered the position of King&#x27;s Counsel in 1928. The family was well off, but the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and ensuing Great Depression dramatically changed their circumstances. Within a year the loans Bull had taken to buy stocks on margin were called in, and the family was forced to move to Toronto to look for work.

The next year Gertrude Bull suffered complications while giving birth to her 10th child, Gordon. She died April 1, 1931. George Bull suffered a nervous breakdown and fell into heavy drinking; he left his children in the care of his sister Laura, who fell victim to cancer and died in mid-1934. The next year, banks foreclosed on the family home. The same year, George, at the age of 58, met and married Rose Bleeker. He gave up the children to various relatives: Gerald ending up living with his older sister Bernice.

In 1938, Gerald was sent to spend the summer holidays with his uncle and aunt, Philip and Edith LaBrosse (Philip was the younger brother of Gerald&#x27;s mother, Gertrude). During the Depression, Phil and Edith had won about $175,000 in the Irish Sweepstakes, and were relatively well off. Gerald was sent to an all-boys Jesuit school, Regiopolis College, Kingston, Ontario. Although too young to attend, the school allowed him to start in 1938 and he returned to spend the summers with the LaBrosses. During this time he took up the hobby of building balsa wood airplanes of his own design, and was a member of the school&#x27;s modelling club. He graduated in 1944.

==University==

After graduating, Bull entered Queen&#x27;s University, with hopes of eventually entering military officers&#x27; training school. Philip LaBrosse visited the University of Toronto with the intention of having Bull placed there. He wrote to Bull, who was in Kingston, having found room in the medical school. Bull declined the offer and instead asked LaBrosse if a position in the new aeronautical engineering course was available. The department, being brand new, had limited qualifying criteria for entrance and agreed to interview Bull even though he was only sixteen years old – and he was accepted into the undergraduate program. Records and recollections of both classmates and his professors show little evidence of Bull&#x27;s brilliance; one professor noted that &quot;He certainly didn&#x27;t stand out&quot;. After graduating in 1948, with marks that were described as &quot;strictly average&quot;, Bull took a drafting job at A.V. Roe Canada.

Later that year, the University of Toronto opened a new Institute of Aerodynamics (now the Institute for Aerospace Studies) under the direction of Dr. Gordon Patterson. The Institute could afford to employ twelve students, accepting three per year for a four-year period, and was funded by the Defence Research Board (DRB). Bull applied and was accepted at Patterson&#x27;s personal recommendation, as Patterson felt that any lack in academics was made up for by Bull&#x27;s tremendous energy. Bull was soon assigned to work with fellow student Doug Henshaw, and the two were given the task of building a supersonic wind tunnel, which was at that time a relatively rare device.

When the Royal Canadian Air Force donated land adjacent to RCAF Station Downsview to the institute, the operations were quickly moved. During construction, Bull used the wind tunnel as the basis for his September 15, 1949 Master&#x27;s thesis, on the design and construction of advanced wind tunnels. The tunnel was to be featured prominently during the opening of the new Institute grounds, leading to an all-night rush to get it fully operational in time for the presentation. The work was completed at 3:30 am, but the team was too exhausted to test it. The next day Air Marshal Wilfred Curtis pushed the start button and nothing happened, but Dr. Patterson quickly reached around, pushed harder, and the wind tunnel worked perfectly.

Bull had largely finished his PhD thesis on the same topic in 1950, when a request from the DRB asking that the Institute provide an aerodynamicist to help on their Velvet Glove Missile project arrived. It was to be an unpaid position on which the volunteer would remain on a normal PhD stipend from the university. Patterson selected Bull for the position, which led to a period of successful work at the Canadian Armament and Research Development Establishment, or CARDE.

==Career==
===Canada===
The Canadian Armament and Research Development Establishment (CARDE) was formed as a joint Canadian-British operation to study artillery and ballistics, in an effort to harness the intellectual resources of Canada, as well as to place developing British technology outside of German reach during World War II. Formed up on a military training area and artillery range outside Valcartier, northwest of Quebec City, CARDE was one of a number of research divisions of the DRB that were well funded in the immediate post-war era. CARDE was researching supersonic flight and a variety of rocket and missile projects when Bull was asked to join. Bull asked to build a wind tunnel for this research, but his suggestions were dismissed as too expensive.

Gunners at CARDE suggested that firing models out of existing gun barrels would permit gathering data at much lower cost, and guided Bull in this direction. As a proof of concept, they tried an Ordnance QF 17-pounder barrel bored to . The aerodynamicists&#x27; demands to accommodate larger models resulted in boring out a BL 5.5 inch Medium Gun barrel to produce a smooth-bore. Borrowing an idea developed in England in 1916, cards were placed on holders along the range and scaled models of the missile fired through them. The models were carried in a segmented aluminum sabot, which peeled away as the round left the muzzle.

As originally built the range was long, with &quot;jump cards&quot; located at intervals. A metallic coating on the cards permitted timing of flight progress to measure velocity. One station was equipped for Schlieren photography to record the shock waves and wake around the projectile. In some ways this technique was superior to wind tunnel study, as it allowed for the direct measurement of real-world influences on the trajectory, as a test of theoretical calculations. On the downside, reducing the collected data to a mathematical trajectory for checking against the theoretical calculations is difficult.

Bull was at CARDE briefly before returning to the university to defend his thesis in March 1951, at 23 years old becoming the youngest PhD graduate in the institute&#x27;s history—a record that remains to this day. He returned to CARDE, now on the DRB&#x27;s payroll, and continued working on the instrumented guns. On one of these trips, in 1953, he and a friend stopped in Charny after a fishing trip to drop off some of their catch at a local doctor&#x27;s house. Bull met Noemi &quot;Mimi&quot; Gilbert, the doctor&#x27;s daughter, and the two soon started dating. Given Bull&#x27;s work schedule they were rarely able to see each other, but they became engaged in February 1954, and married on July 15. Gilbert gave the couple a small house as a wedding gift. Mimi gave birth to their first son, Phillippe, on July 3, 1955, and a second, Michel, in November 1956.

In 1954 Bull decided that a wind tunnel was too important to ignore, even if he could not arrange for funding through the DRB. Instead, he gained the ear of professors at Laval University in Quebec City, and Bull and a number of graduate students started work on a tunnel similar to the one he had earlier built at the UofT. It opened in the summer of 1955 and was capable of speeds up to Mach 4, but cost only $6,000, the result of using scrap for most of its parts.

Bull&#x27;s work was brought to the public&#x27;s attention in a May 20, 1955 &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; headline article, &quot;Unveil Canadian Gun that Fires 4,550 M.P.H. Missiles&quot;. Around this time Bull further improved the data-collection capabilities of the system by developing a telemetry system that could fit in the models. DRB staff thought the idea was unworkable and worked against having it funded, but Bull shuffled his own department&#x27;s funding and went ahead and developed it anyway. All the parts of Bull&#x27;s future efforts, smooth-bore high-velocity guns, sabots for increasing performance, and hardened electronics, were now complete.

Work on the Velvet Glove ended in 1956, and the DRB turned its attention to anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs). Bull&#x27;s gun system was not fast enough to be useful in this role, so it was adapted to use a &quot;sabot&quot; to improve its performance. Bull then moved on to hypersonics research and the study of infrared and radar cross sections for detection. As the UK&#x27;s research efforts wound down in the post-war political environment, CARDE&#x27;s joint UK-Canadian funding was dramatically cut back, with the project eventually being handed over to the Canadians entirely and followed by further cuts. Bull was vocal about this turn of events, calling the Liberal government of the day &quot;second-rate lawyers and jumped-up real-estate salesmen&quot;.

During this period CARDE was visited by a US team, including Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau, who was impressed with Bull&#x27;s work. Trudeau was director of US Army Research and Development, and he quickly set up a similar effort at the Aberdeen Proving Ground under the direction of Dr. Charles Murphy. They built an analog of Bull&#x27;s gun using a gun and started test firing it over the Atlantic in 1961. The team used a fire-control radar from a Nike Hercules missile battery to track the shells, which released a cloud of chaff at altitudes up to .

Around the same time, Bull and Murphy started discussing the idea of firing scale aircraft models from their guns. Both started working on the idea, but Bull beat Murphy when he successfully fired a model of the Gloster Javelin from his gun and managed to take shadowgraph photos of it showing supersonic shock cones. Bull then used the same method to work on the Avro Arrow, discovering an instability that led to the use of a stability augmentation system. Work on the Avro Arrow was soon cancelled, which angered Bull.

With attention turning to space after the launch of Sputnik in 1957, Bull leaked a story that Canada would soon match this feat by placing a high-velocity gun in the nose of a US Army Redstone missile. The story was a complete fabrication, but caused a major stir when it hit the papers on April 22, 1958. After the story broke Prime Minister John Diefenbaker was besieged in the House of Commons press scrum, later dismissing it stating that &quot;There is no foundation whatsoever to the story, not a scintilla of truth to it&quot;.

A major flap broke out as a result, leading to the dressing down of several of Bull&#x27;s superiors. When the press was invited to visit CARDE, the Canadian Broadcasting Company broadcast a piece covering much of the work at CARDE on May 11, including lengthy sections on Bull&#x27;s gun and their work on infrared detection and anti-ballistic missile systems.

On April 1, 1961, Bull got into an argument with his direct superior over paperwork. Bull wrote out his resignation. A report prepared after his departure stated &quot;... his tempestuous nature and strong dislike for administration and red tape constantly led him into trouble with senior management.&quot;

===High Altitude Research Project===
Bull had long prepared for this event, and soon re-appeared as a professor at McGill University, which was in the process of building up a large engineering department under the direction of Donald Mordell. Mordell had long maintained links with CARDE and became one of Bull&#x27;s ardent supporters, in spite of what other professors saw as &quot;second-rate attempts at manipulation&quot; and that &quot;[Mordell] always supported Bull&#x27;s work ... I think sometimes he got pretty tired of supporting Bull.&quot; Bull, for his part, appeared to enjoy the new position, and later described it as &quot;a marriage made in heaven&quot;. Bull remained in contact with his counterparts in the US and the University of Toronto, and set about equipping the university with the instrumentation it would need to be a leader in the field of aerodynamics.

Several years earlier, while still working at CARDE, Gerald and Mimi had purchased a plot of land on the Québec–Vermont border. Bull donated the land to be used by McGill and turned into a new ballistics lab, a private analog of the CARDE site. Renamed to become &quot;Highwater Station&quot; due to the local village of Highwater, Quebec, the site was quickly developed under the direction of former British Army colonel Robert Stacy, who bulldozed large sections, built various test facilities and ran power to the site. There they began working with and artillery pieces.

In late 1961 Bull visited Murphy and Trudeau at Aberdeen and was able to interest them in the idea of using guns to loft missile components for re-entry research, a task that was otherwise very expensive and time-consuming aboard rockets. They arranged funding for the work under Project HARP (for &quot;High Altitude Research Project&quot;, not to be confused with HAARP). The US Navy supplied a surplus battleship gun, and a contract from the Office of Naval Research paid for the gun to be re-bored into a smooth bore. The entire contract, excluding shipping, was only $2,000.
The performance of the gun was so great that the Highwater site was too small to support it. McGill had long been running a meteorological station on Barbados and had close connections with the new Democratic Labour Party (DLP), and suggested that it would make an ideal location for the gun to be set up. Bull met with then Premier Errol Barrow who became Barbados&#x27; first Prime Minister after Barbados received its Independence from the UK in 1966. Barrow, an enthusiastic supporter of HARP, arranged for a firing site at Paragon, on the southeast coast of the island near the Seawell Airport. The guns arrived in early 1962 but could not be put ashore at the site, and had to be offloaded up the coast at Foul Bay, and then transported overland via a purpose-built railway that employed hundreds of locals. As the project continued, this figure grew to over 300 permanently employed with the project, and it became a major reason for Barrow&#x27;s continued support. Bull encouraged the locals to use the project as a stepping-stone to a science or engineering degree of their own, and his efforts were widely lauded in the press.

In January 1962 the first test shot was carried out, firing an empty sabot. The test was completely successful, so a further two similar firings were abandoned and the second firing was made with a dart-like finned projectile named &quot;Martlet&quot; (after the mythical bird without feet on the McGill University crest). These tests demonstrated several problems, including poor shot-to-shot performance of the decades-old gunpowder, and the fact that the projectile left the barrel so quickly that the powder did not have time to burn completely. New charges using modern powder were soon supplied, and by November 1962 the 150-kilogram Martlets were being fired at over and reaching altitudes of .

The Martlets evolved through this period, growing in size and sophistication. As Bull later put it:

The Martlet&#x27;s electronics triggered the release of the chemical markers at a set altitude. This left a sort of &quot;smoke trail&quot; through the atmosphere that could be used to measure winds aloft by visual means. The chemical was typically triethylaluminium, which burns on contact with air. Loading the shells was a dangerous job that required special handling. The Martlets were also used to release chaff instead of chemicals, allowing tracking via radar. Some shots used additional electronics to measure the magnetic field. Similar firings in support of the upper atmosphere research were made using 5&quot; and 7&quot; guns at Highwater, Alaska, and Wallops Island, Virginia.

By the time the program ran down, about 1,000 firings had taken place, and the data collected during HARP represents half of all the upper-atmospheric data to this day.

The Martlet-2 was only a stepping-stone on the way to Bull&#x27;s real interest, a gun-launched rocket that could reach outer space. The gun had been thoroughly tested and was well past intercontinental ranges, but needed modifying. In early 1963 HARP started experimenting with the &quot;Martlet-3&quot;, a 7-inch-diameter (177.8 mm) &quot;full bore&quot; projectile designed to test the basic problems of launching a solid-fuel artillery shell from guns. Solid shell fuel has the consistency of soft rubber and is cut into a pattern that is open in the middle, so on firing the &quot;grain&quot; would tend to collapse into the cavity. This problem was solved by filling the cavity with zinc bromide, which prevented the collapse and was drained after firing to allow the rocket to light. Test firings began at the US Ballistic Research Laboratory (now part of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory) in Aberdeen using a bored-out 175 mm gun from the M107. This program proved the basic concept and shots of the Martlet-3 reached altitudes of .

The ultimate goal of the program was the &quot;Martlet-4&quot;, a three-stage 16.4&quot; rocket that would be fired from a lengthened gun at Barbados and would reach orbit. In 1964 Donald Mordell was able to convince the Canadian government of the value of the HARP project as a low-cost method for Canada to enter the space-launch business, and arranged a joint Canadian-US funding program of $3 million a year for three years, with the Canadians supplying $2.5 million of that. Another 16.4&quot; gun, mounted horizontally, was being tested at the Highwater range, and was extended by cutting the breech off the end of one gun and welding it to the end of another to produce a new gun over 110 feet long. The extension allowed the powder to be contained for a longer period of time, slowing down the acceleration and loads on the airframe, while also offering higher overall performance. Once the system had been tested at Highwater, a second barrel was shipped to Foul Bay, attached and strengthened with external bracing to allow it to be raised from the horizontal. This gun was extensively tested in 1965 and 1966.
The orbital project faced a constant race with its own budget. Originally guaranteed three years of funding, the money was handled by the DRB, who was less than impressed with its former &quot;star&quot; going on to greater things while their own funding was being dramatically cut. Although the money was allocated for 1964, the DRB managed to delay delivery for ten months, forcing McGill to cover salaries in the interim. These problems did not go unnoticed in the US Army, and in order to ensure that firings would not be interrupted by problems on the Canadian side, a third double-length gun was built at the Yuma Proving Grounds to continue the high-altitude measurements. On November 18, 1966, this gun launched a Martlet-2 to 180 km, a world record that still stands today.

By 1967 it was becoming clear that the Martlet-4 would not be ready by the time the funding ran out in 1968. An effort started to build a simplified version, the GLO-1A (Gun-launched Orbiter, Version 1A), based on the Martlet-2G. Continued budget pressures, changing public attitudes towards military affairs, negative reviews from the press and other researchers in Canada and a change of government all conspired to ensure that Canadian funding was not renewed in 1967. Bull had been working on a last-ditch effort to launch a Canadian flag into orbit in time for the Canadian Centennial, but nothing came of this plan.

===Space Research Corporation===

Bull returned to his Highwater range, and transferred HARP&#x27;s assets to a new company. He invoked a clause in the original contract with McGill that required them to return the range to its original natural condition. Faced with hundreds of thousands of dollars in construction costs to wind down a project that could not garner funding, McGill was left with little choice but to trade Bull for title to the Highwater equipment. Setting up a new company, Space Research Corporation (SRC), Bull became an international artillery consultant. Incorporated in both Quebec and Vermont, a number of contracts from both the Canadian and US military research arms helped the company get started.. In the late 1960s, Bull established a space program at Norwich University, in Northfield, Vermont.

At SRC Bull continued the development of his high-velocity artillery, adapting the HARP smoothbore into a new &quot;reverse rifled&quot; design where the lands of a conventional rifling were replaced by grooves cut into the barrel to make a slightly larger gun also capable of firing existing ammunition. Normally artillery shells are sealed into the rifling by a driving band of soft metal like copper, which demands that the shell be shaped so that it balances at its widest point, where the band is located. This is not ideal for ballistics, especially supersonically where a higher fineness ratio is desirable. Bull solved this problem by using an additional set of nub &quot;fins&quot; near the front of the shell to keep it centered in the barrel, allowing the driving band to be greatly reduced in size, and located wherever was convenient. Re-shaping the shell for better supersonic performance provided dramatically improved range and accuracy, up to double in both cases, when compared to a similar gun using older-style ammunition. He called the new shell design &quot;Extended Range, Full Bore&quot; (ERFB).
Starting in 1975, Bull designed a new gun based on the common US 155/39 M109 howitzer, extending it slightly to 45 calibre through modifications that could be applied to existing weapons, calling the resulting weapon the GC-45 howitzer. Bull also purchased the base bleed technology being developed in Sweden, which allowed for further improvements in range. The gun offered ranges far in excess of even the longest-ranged heavy artillery in a gun only slightly larger than common medium-weight guns.

SRC&#x27;s first major sales success was the sale of 50,000 ERFB shells to Israel in 1973 for use in American-supplied artillery pieces. The Israelis had successfully used a number of 175 mm M107 guns in the counter-battery role against its Soviet counterpart, the 130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46), but the introduction of long range rockets fired from Lebanon outranged them. The ERFB shells extended the range of the already formidable M107 to as much as , allowing the guns to counter-battery even the longest range rockets. 

Bull was rewarded for success of this program by a Congressional bill, sponsored by Senator Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) making him retroactively eligible for a decade of American citizenship and high-level American nuclear security clearance. He was granted citizenship by an Act of Congress.

===Sanctions contravention===
In 1977 and 1978, Bull orchestrated the illegal sale of 30,000 155 mm artillery shells, gun barrels and plans for the GC-45 howitzer as well as radar equipment to Armscor, the South African state arms corporation; with two shipments made through Antigua in 1978 and another through Spain in 1979. The South African Defence Force&#x27;s arsenal of vintage howitzers, antiquated by the arms embargo, had been outperformed by BM-21 Grads during &quot;Operation Savannah&quot; in 1975. In order to counter the modern Soviet artillery deployed in neighbouring Angola, South African officials began seeking longer-ranged weapons systems and were referred to SRC. Armscor trialled the GC-45 with a new mounting to allow for increased powder loads and installed an auxiliary power unit for improving mobility in the field. The resulting G5 howitzer was vital to South African campaigns against Cuban expeditionary forces in Angola, allowing them to target infrastructure and personnel with phenomenal accuracy. In addition, the urgent shipments were also meant to address the acute shortage of artillery shells due to their incursion into Angola.

Once these shipments had been uncovered, Bull was arrested for illegal arms dealing in contravention of UN Security Council Resolution 418 for arms export to South Africa. Expecting a token punishment, Bull found himself spending six months in the Federal Correctional Complex, Allenwood, Pennsylvania in 1980. After his release, he was again charged (this time in Canadian courts) for transferring technology on 155mm extended range shell development to China without the necessary export permits and fined $55,000 for international arms dealing.

===Support to Iraq===
Bull left Canada and moved to Brussels, where a subsidiary of SRC called European Poudreries Réunies de Belgique was based. Bull continued working with the ERFB ammunition design, developing a range of munitions that could be fired from existing weapons. A number of companies designed upgrades to work with older weapons, like the M114 155 mm howitzer, combining a new barrel from the M109 with Bull&#x27;s ERFB ammunition to produce an improved weapon for relatively low cost.

Bull also continued working with the GC-45 design, and soon secured work with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and then Iraq. He designed two artillery pieces for the Iraqis: the 155 mm &quot;Al-Majnoonan&quot;, an updated version of the G5, and a similar set of adaptations applied to the 203 mm US M110 howitzer to produce the 210 mm Al-Fao with a maximum range of without base bleed. Although it appears the Al-Fao was not put into production, the Al-Majnoonan started replacing Soviet designs as quickly as they could be delivered. When deliveries could not be made quickly enough, additional barrels were ordered from South Africa. The guns were built and sold through an Austrian intermediary.

Based on his HARP results, Bull secured additional Iraqi funding and support for the construction of a smoothbore gun barrel assembly. He received a $25m down-payment for the project on condition that he continued the development work on the &quot;Al-Majnoonan&quot; and &quot;Al-Fao&quot; guns. Initially, a smaller 45-meter, 350 mm caliber gun (known as &quot;Baby-Babylon&quot;) was completed for testing purposes and then Bull started work on the &quot;real&quot; &quot;PC-2&quot; machine, a gun that was 150 meters long, weighed 1,510 tonnes, with a bore of one meter (39 inches) that would allow the firing of multi-stage rocket-assisted shells with a range of over or to launch satellites into orbit. The project objective was to eventually provide Iraq with three 350 mm &quot;Baby Babylon&quot; guns and two 1000 mm PC-2 &quot;Big Babylon&quot; guns.

The Iraqis then told Bull they would go ahead with the project only if he would also help with development of their longer-range Scud-based missile project. Bull agreed. Construction of the individual sections of the new gun started in England at Sheffield Forgemasters and Matrix Churchill as well as in Spain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland while he concurrently worked on the Scud project, making calculations for the new nose cone needed for the greater re-entry speeds and temperatures the missile would face.

==Death==
Over a few months, his apartment suffered several non-robbery break-ins, apparently as a threat or a warning, but he continued to work on the project. On 22 March 1990, Bull was shot five times in the head and back at point-blank range while approaching the door of his apartment in Brussels. He was pronounced dead at the scene. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that when police arrived at the scene they found the key still in his door and his unopened briefcase containing nearly $20,000 in cash. Another account states he was shot by a three-man team when he answered the doorbell.

The cooperation between Bull and Saddam Hussein was an immediate threat to Israel which had had previous military engagements with Iraq during the Arab–Israeli war. Watching the development of the gun, Israel feared it could be used to launch nuclear weapons, but the re-designed Scud missiles were of greater concern at that moment.

===Aftermath===
According to investigative journalist Gordon Thomas, the assassination of Bull had been sanctioned by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Nahum Admoni sent a three-man team to Brussels, where the Mossad agents shot Bull at his door-step. Within hours of the killing, according to Thomas, Mossad was engaged in distributing false stories to the European media, alleging that Bull had been shot by agents from Iraq.

Although it was in the immediate interest of both Israel and Iran that Bull discontinue his cooperation with Saddam Hussein, he had worked for many different parties in many critical defence projects, and had become both an asset and a liability for several powerful groups simultaneously. Given Bull&#x27;s past ventures, it has been speculated that besides Iran or Israel, the CIA; MI6; or the Chilean, Syrian, Iraqi, or South African government could have been behind his assassination.

===Remaining equipment===
Project Babylon was stopped when supergun parts were seized by Customs in the United Kingdom in March 1990 leading to most of Bull&#x27;s staff returning to Canada. Some of the confiscated parts have survived after they were not needed as evidence and because customs were interested in the story, some of the barrel pipes were given to museums and to the Ministry of Defence. In Iraq, all remaining gun barrels and propellants were destroyed by UN inspectors after the Persian Gulf War in October 1991.

<text>Baxter County is a county in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. Created as Arkansas&#x27;s 66th county on March 24, 1873, the county has eight incorporated municipalities, including Mountain Home, its largest city and county seat. The county is named for Elisha Baxter, the tenth governor of Arkansas. It is coterminal with the Mountain Home Micropolitan Statistical Area.

The county is located in a steep section of the Ozark Mountains sometimes known as the Twin Lakes Area because it is bordered by two of Arkansas&#x27;s largest lakes, Bull Shoals Lake and Norfork Lake. On its southern border are the White River, Norfork Tailwater and the Buffalo National River. Occupying 587 square miles (170,000 ha), the county&#x27;s population was 41,627 as of the 2020 Census, ranking Baxter the 66th largest and 16th most populous of the 75 counties in Arkansas. The county seat is Mountain Home. The county contains five protected areas, including parts of the Buffalo National River, Ozark National Forest, Bull Shoals-White River State Park, and two Wildlife Management Areas. The natural environment of nearby Norfork and Bull Shoals lakes and the surrounding countryside has attracted tourists from around the country for many years. Educational institutions have also played a role in the life of the community. Other historical features such as the Jacob Wolf House and Cold Water School preserve the history and culture of Baxter County.

Baxter County is served by three public school districts: Mountain Home, Cotter, and Norfork, and contains one public community college: Arkansas State University–Mountain Home (ASUMH). Baxter Health serves as a healthcare hub for the region. Although no Interstate highways serve Baxter County, the county has access to two concurrent United States highways: U.S. Highway 62 (US 62) and US 412, and thirteen Arkansas state highways. Baxter County is served by two public use airports: Baxter County Airport and Gaston&#x27;s White River Resort Airstrip, two electric service providers, and fifteen public water systems providing potable water to customers in the county.

==History==
Baxter County was created by the 19th Arkansas General Assembly on March 24, 1873, from parts of Fulton, Izard, Marion, and Searcy counties. It was named for Elisha Baxter, who was governor of Arkansas at the time. The small community of Mountain Home was named temporary county seat; and was later named permanent county seat.

In 1945, Baxter County voted to take the county &quot;dry&quot;—liquor sales prohibited—in 1945 by a vote of 548 to 432. The liquor sales prohibition was overturned in 1978 in the heaviest voter turnout in county history to that date, with 6,175 for the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors and 5,991 against. A narrow margin of 184 votes took the county &quot;wet&quot;.

==Geography==

Baxter County is located within the Salem Plateau, a subregion of the Ozark Mountains. Land near Bull Shoals Lake, Norfork Lake, and along the White River are within the White River Hills subregion, known for steep, rocky soils, spring-fed mountain streams, and oak-hickory-pine forest. Eastern Baxter County and a small area around Mountain Home are within the Central Plateau subregion, known for comparatively flatter terrain more suited for hayfields, pastures, and housing, as well as karst.

The county has a total area of , of which is land and (5.5%) is water.

The county is located approximately southeast of Springfield, Missouri, north of Little Rock, and southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Baxter County is surrounded by sparsely populated Ozark counties on all sides: Fulton County to the east, Izard County to the southeast, Stone County to the south, Searcy County to the southwest, Marion County to the west, and Ozark County, Missouri to the north.

===Hydrology===
Baxter County is within the White River watershed. The river has several important milestones in Baxter County: beginning along the western boundary of Baxter County, the White River is impounded to form the Bull Shoals Lake reservoir by Bull Shoals Dam, which spans the Baxter-Marion county line. South of the dam, the White River forms the western boundary of Baxter-Marion county line until Buffalo City, when the Buffalo National River empties into the White, with the White continuing across Baxter County from west to east. South of Salesville, the North Fork of White River empties into the White via the Norfork Tailwater downstream of Norfork Dam. Within the county, Barren Fork, Big Creek, Bruce Creek, Hightower Creek, Leatherwood Creek, and Moccasin Creek are important watercourses.

===Protected areas===
Baxter County contains a small section of the Buffalo National River near Buffalo City where the river empties into the White River. Almost all land in Baxter County south of the White River is part of the Ozark National Forest. Within this area, a subdivision of the Ozark National Forest known as the Leatherwood Wilderness is located along Highway 341 (Push Mountain Road). Another part of the Ozark National Forest is also protected in the Sylamore Wildlife Management Area (WMA). The WMA is known as a destination for hiking, fishing, and hunting wild turkey, bear, squirrel, and deer. Camping is available at Blanchard Springs Caverns, Gunner Pool, and Barkshed areas and a gun range is open to the public. The Ozark Highlands Trail passes through the Leatherwood Wilderness and Sylamore WMA.

The Bull Shoals-White River State Park is along the downstream shoreline of Bull Shoals Lake at the Bull Shoals Dam. The park contains campgrounds, a marina, and visitor center. The dam tailwater is well known for trout fishing.

Norfork Lake WMA is a series of protected walk-in hunting areas along Lake Norfork covered in hardwood forest with some pine and ranging topography. The four Baxter County units are Indian Head Unit, Chapin Point Unit, Seward Point Unit, and the Bennett&#x27;s Creek Unit. The WMA is managed for deer, turkey and small game and attracts waterfowl during migration.

==Culture and contemporary life==
Baxter County has several facilities, monuments, and museums dedicated to preserving the history and culture of the area. Perhaps one of the most recognizable and important historic structures in Baxter County is the Cotter Bridge over the White River. Upon opening in 1930, the bridge opened Baxter County and north Arkansas to economic development and tourism by providing reliable transportation across the White River.

Two facilities interpret the county&#x27;s history and heritage: the Jacob Wolf House, a historic log cabin built in 1825, is operated as a historic house museum by the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage, and Tourism, and the Baxter County Heritage Center, located in the former Rollins Hospital in downtown Gassville. Five National Register of Historic Places (NRHP, complete county list) properties in the county relate to the history of education: Buford School Building, Cold Water School, and the Horace Mann School Historic District, as well as Big Flat School Gymnasium, Old Cotter High School Gymnasium. Several buildings are preserved for connections to the county&#x27;s economic and cultural history: Baxter County Courthouse, the Sid Hutcheson Building in Norfork, and several structures in the Mountain Home Commercial Historic District.

===Media===

The county newspaper is &quot;The Baxter Bulletin&quot;, a daily newspaper established in Mountain Home in 1901. The first newspaper published in Baxter County was the &quot;Quid Nunc&quot;, from 1877 to 1880. The &quot;Baxter County Citizen&quot; was published in Mountain Home from 1880 until 1937. Mountain Home was also home to briefly operated papers named &quot;The North Arkansas Herald&quot; (monthly, ) and &quot;The Arkansas News&quot; ().

Cotter has been home to five newspapers over the years, the longest lasting being the &quot;Cotter Courier&quot; (1903-c. 1918) and &quot;The Cotter Record&quot; (1911-1937). Publications lasting only a year or so include &quot;The White River Headlight&quot;, &quot;The Screech Owl&quot;, and the &quot;Bull Shoals Gazette&quot;. &quot;The Ozark Clarion&quot; was briefly published at Three Brothers around 1912, and &quot;Norfork Enterprise&quot; ran briefly at Norfork.

==Government==
The county government is a constitutional body granted specific powers by the Constitution of Arkansas and the Arkansas Code. The quorum court is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all spending and revenue collection. Representatives are called &quot;justices of the peace&quot; and are elected from county districts every even-numbered year. The number of districts in a county vary from nine to fifteen based on population, and district boundaries are drawn by the Baxter County Election Commission. The Baxter County Quorum Court has eleven members. Presiding over quorum court meetings is the &quot;county judge&quot;, who serves as the chief operating officer of the county. The county judge is elected at-large and does not vote in quorum court business, although capable of vetoing quorum court decisions.

In the Arkansas Senate, Baxter County is within the 23rd District. The district contains Marion County and parts of Boone, Fulton, and Izard counties, and has been represented by Scott Flippo (R) since 2015. In the Arkansas House of Representatives, Baxter County is split among three districts: the 3rd District (Stetson Painter, R, since 2023), the 4th District (Jack Fortner, R, since 2023), and the 27th (Steven Walker, R, since 2023).

==Politics==
Over the past few election cycles Baxter county has trended heavily towards the GOP. The last Democrat (as of 2024) to carry this county was Arkansas native Bill Clinton in 1992.












===Taxation===

Property tax is assessed by the Baxter County Assessor annually based upon the fair market value of the property and determining which tax rate, commonly called a &quot;millage&quot; in Arkansas, will apply. The rate depends upon the property&#x27;s location with respect to city limits, school district, and special tax increment financing (TIF) districts. This tax is collected by the Baxter County Collector between the first business day of March of each year through October 15 without penalty. The Baxter County Treasurer disburses tax revenues to various government agencies, such as cities, county road departments, fire departments, libraries, and police departments in accordance with the budget set by the quorum court.

Sales and use taxes in Arkansas are voter approved and collected by the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration.
Arkansas&#x27;s statewide sales and use tax has been 6.5% since July 1, 2013. Baxter County has an additional sales and use tax of 1.25% since January 1, 2019. Within Baxter County, the City of Mountain Home has had an additional 2.125% sales and use tax since July 1, 2021, and Cotter has had an additional 2% since January 1, 2022, with the remaining incorporated communities having 1.00% sales and use tax rates. The Arkansas State Treasurer disburses tax revenue to counties/cities in accordance with tax rules.

==Communities==
Seven incorporated cities and one town are located within the county. The largest city and county seat is Mountain Home, located centrally between Bull Shoals Lake and Lake Norfork. Mountain Home had a population of 12,825 at the 2020 census and is the focal point of the Mountain Home, AR, Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Baxter County. Cotter and Gassville are located west of Mountain Home. Briarcliff, Norfork, and Salesville are small towns with populations under 1,000 south of Mountain Home. Lakeview is a small municipality on Bull Shoals Lake. The small town of Big Flat is located in the southern part of Baxter County, and partly in Searcy County.

The United States Census Bureau has also designated four unincorporated communities as Census-designated places: Gamaliel and Henderson near Norfork Lake, Buffalo City near the Buffalo National River, and Midway between Mountain Home and Lakeview.

===Other unincorporated communities===
Baxter County has dozens of unincorporated communities and ghost towns within its borders. This is due to early settlers in Arkansas tending to settle in small clusters rather than incorporated towns. Some communities, including Bennett&#x27;s, Cumi, Custer, and Hand were inundated during creation of Lake Norfork. For example, communities like Clarkridge and Monkey Run had a post office or other buildings at some point in their history. Other communities are simply a few dwellings at a crossroads, or a residential area near a cove or point on the lake that have adopted a common place name over time. Some are officially listed as populated places by the United States Geological Survey, and others are listed as historic settlements.

<text>Ashley County is a rural South Arkansas county with a culture, economy, and history based on timber and agriculture. Created as Arkansas&#x27;s 52nd county on November 30, 1848, Ashley County has seven incorporated municipalities, including Hamburg, the county seat and Crossett, the most populous city. The county is also the site of numerous unincorporated communities and ghost towns. The county is named for Chester Ashley, a prominent lawyer in the Arkansas Territory and U.S. senator from the state from 1844 to 1848.

The county is roughly divided into two halves by Bayou Bartholomew, with the rich, fertile, alluvial soils of the Arkansas Delta in the east, and the shortleaf pine forests of the Arkansas Timberlands in the west. The county contains six protected areas: Overflow National Wildlife Refuge, Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge, three Wildlife Management Areas and the Crossett Experimental Forest. Other historical features such as log cabins, one-room school houses, community centers, and museums describe the history and culture of Ashley County.

Ashley County occupies and contained a population of 19,062 as of the 2020 Census. The economy is largely based on agriculture and small manufacturing. Poverty and unemployment rates are above national averages, but steady. Household incomes are below state and national averages.

Ashley County is mostly served by two school districts, Hamburg School District and Crossett School District. Higher education is provided at University of Arkansas at Monticello College of Technology—Crossett, a public two-year community college in Crossett. Ashley County Medical Center in Crossett is a community hospital providing primary care in the county. Although no Interstate highways serve Ashley County, the county has access to three United States highways (U.S. Route 82 [US 82], US 165, and US 425) and eleven Arkansas state highways. Ashley County is also served by one public owned/public use general aviation airport, Z. M. Jack Stell Field, one electric cooperative (Ashley-Chicot Electric Cooperative), and ten community water systems provide potable water to customers in the county. It is an alcohol prohibition or dry county.

==History==
Ashley County, the fifth-largest county in Arkansas in terms of land area, was formed by the 7th Arkansas General Assembly on November 30, 1848, from portions of Drew, Chicot and Union Counties. It was named after Chester Ashley, a US Senator and land speculator. The final borders were laid in 1861.

The first settlement in Ashley County appears to have been made by the French at Longview. Now there is no trace of Longview that was a river town connecting the Arkansas Post and Monroe, Louisiana. The Fogle and Gulett families claimed to have located at Longview in 1768 or 1770. In 1846 Captain Phillip Derden came from Virginia and moved to Longview. He bought furs and skins from hunters and trappers and ran a general store for pioneer settlers. He built a log warehouse and a lived in a 2-story log cabin. The home of Isaac Denson in Fountain Hill served as the temporary county seat until a new centrally located town could be established in 1849. It was named &quot;Hamburg&quot; in honor of &quot;fine deer hams&quot; enjoyed by the county commissioners making the selection in the vicinity. The 1850 courthouse was replaced in 1905 but was lost in a fire in 1921. The current courthouse was built in the 1960s. The courtroom in the courthouse has a one-of-a-kind architecture: it is round, and the seats are arranged so that members of the audience can always see each other.

John R. Steelman, who wrote his 1928 PhD dissertation on &quot;mob action in the South&quot;, wrote:Ashley County has had five lynchings since 1900, the last of which occurred in 1927. On February 19, 1904 at Crossett - a sawmill town - a Negro was lynched for Murder and on September 5, another for &quot;assaulting whites&quot;. In 1908 the only lynching in the state was at Parkdale, 
Ashley County. Earnest Williams was thrust into eternity by a band of men who were &quot;outraged&quot; at him for &quot;using offensive language&quot;&#x27;. On May 30, 1909 a Negro was lynched at Portland for Murder. The last lynching in Ashley County occurred on August 26, 1927, Winston Pounds was &quot;taken from a posse of deputy sheriffs&quot; and hanged to a tree one and a half miles from Wilmot, charged with having &quot;attacked a young married woman&quot;.

==Geography==
Ashley County is split between two geographic regions, divided by the Bayou Bartholomew. The rich, fertile, alluvial soils of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain extend into the eastern part of the county. In Arkansas, this region is called the Arkansas Delta (in Arkansas, usually referred to as &quot;the Delta&quot;), having a distinct history and culture from adjacent regions. West of the Ouachita, Ashley County is characterized by forests of shortleaf pine and hardwoods typical of the Gulf Coastal Plain. In Arkansas, this region is referred to as the Arkansas Timberlands, a subdivision of the Piney Woods.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.6%) is water. The lowest point in the state of Arkansas is located on the Ouachita River in Ashley County and Union County, where it flows out of Arkansas and into Louisiana.

The county is located approximately north of Monroe, Louisiana, south of Little Rock, and northwest of Jackson, Mississippi.

===Adjacent counties===
* Drew County - north
* Chicot County - east
* Morehouse Parish, Louisiana - south
* Union Parish, Louisiana - southwest
* Union County - west
* Bradley County - northwest

===Hydrology===
Water is an extremely important part of Ashley County&#x27;s geography, history, economy, and culture. The many rivers, streams, and ditches crossing the county have featured prominently since prehistoric times, and many archaeological sites, including the Lake Enterprise Mound from the Archaic period, are along waterways. Many early white settlements, including Berea, Arkansas, were founded along waterways, but many faded as railroads eclipsed waterways as the favored mode of transportation.

Ashley County is split among four watersheds: the lower Saline River in the northwest, lower Ouachita River in the southwest, Bayou Bartholomew across the majority of the county, and the Boeuf River along the eastern edge. The Saline River serves as the northwestern boundary of the county before emptying into the Ouachita River, which serves as the southwestern boundary. The Port of Crossett is positioned just south of the Saline River&#x27;s mouth. Within the county, Bearhouse Creek, Chemin-a-haut Bayou, Fountain Creek, Flat Creek, Mill Creek, and Overflow Creek are important watercourses.

===Protected areas===
Ashley County contains Overflow National Wildlife Refuge, part of the Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge, and four Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) under Arkansas Game and Fish Commission jurisdiction.

Beryl Anthony Lower Ouachita WMA preserves seasonally flooded bottomland hardwood forest habitat along the Ouachita River between the Felsenthal NWR and the Louisiana state line for preservation, recreation, and hunting opportunities. Duck hunting, especially when the Ouachita River floods, is the primary hunting opportunity due to the site&#x27;s position along the Mississippi Flyway, with deer and squirrel hunting also available during the year. Most of the is on the Union County side of the Ouachita River, leaving the only public access to the Ashley County area via boat. A small segment in Ashley County contains the Coffee Prairie Natural Area, owned by the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission.

The Casey Jones Leased Lands WMA is a common name for five fragmented parcels in Ashley and Drew counties established in 1988. The two largest segments in Ashley County are south of Crossett and in the northwest corner of the county, with a small area northwest of the Overflow WMA also included in Casey Jones WMA. This lease includes segments of working forest actively managed for forest products, primarily by single tree selection. Habitats range from upland pine to bottomland hardwood depending upon location. Deer and turkey hunting are most common in the WMA.

Little Bayou WMA is located in northeastern Ashley County along the western banks of Bayou Bartholomew at the mouth of Little Bayou. The area contains a boat ramp on Bayou Bartholomew, as well as birding, camping, fishing, and hunting. The former agricultural area was replanted with bottomland and upland hardwoods, short-leaf pines, and native warm season grasses in the 1990s. 

The Crossett Experimental Forest is a property donated by Georgia-Pacific Corporation in 1934 to research forest management in second-growth loblolly pine and shortleaf pine forests. Within the Forest is the Reynolds Natural Area, a stand that has been largely untouched since the area&#x27;s creation in 1934. The property is managed by the Southern Research Station of the United States Forest Service.

Ashley County is within the Monroe, Louisiana-El Dorado designated market area with the following local TV stations: KNOE (dual ABC/CBS and The CW), KARD (Fox), KTVE (NBC), and two PBS affiliates: KLTM-TV (Louisiana) and KETZ (Arkansas).

The county is home to two FM radio stations: KAGH-FM (104.9 FM, &quot;Today&#x27;s Country 104.9&quot;) and KWLT (102.7 FM). and KAGH (800 AM, &quot;Oldies Radio 800&quot;).

==Government and politics==

The county government is a constitutional body granted specific powers by the Constitution of Arkansas and the Arkansas Code. The quorum court is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all spending and revenue collection. Representatives are called &quot;justices of the peace&quot; and are elected from county districts every even-numbered year. The number of districts in a county vary from nine to fifteen based on population, and district boundaries are drawn by the Ashley County Election Commission. The Ashley County Quorum Court has eleven members. Presiding over quorum court meetings is the &quot;county judge&quot;, who serves as the chief operating officer of the county. The county judge is elected at-large and does not vote in quorum court business, although capable of vetoing quorum court decisions.

Since the mid-20th century, Ashley County has transitioned from reliably Democratic to steady Republican in national, state and local elections. Ashley County was part of the Solid South, a period of Democratic hegemony which began after Reconstruction following the Civil War. This resulted essentially in a one-party system, in which a candidate&#x27;s victory in Democratic primary elections was tantamount to election to the office itself. The Solid South started to dissolve following the Civil Rights Act in 1964, which is when Ashley County&#x27;s streak of supporting Democratic candidates ended. Republican presidential candidate support continued to grow after 1964, though Ashley County strongly supported fellow Southerners in Presidential elections: Alabama Governor George Wallace in 1968, Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter in 1976, fellow Arkansan Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996, and Al Gore in 2000. By the 2004 election, the county narrowly supported George W. Bush, but subsequently supported Barack Obama&#x27;s opponents and Donald Trump by large margins.

===Political Culture===













In Congress, Arkansas has been represented by two Republican senators, John Boozman and Tom Cotton, since January 3, 2015, ending a long history of Democratic hegemony. In the House of Representatives, Ashley County is the easternmost county within the 4th congressional district, which contains Southwest Arkansas, the Arkansas River Valley, and a few Ozark counties. The 4th has been represented by Bruce Westerman since 2014.

In the Arkansas Senate, Ashley County is within the 1st District. The district contains much of Southeast Arkansas and has been represented by Ben Gilmore (R) since 2021. In the Arkansas House of Representatives, Ashley and Chicot counties make up the 95th district, which has been represented by Howard M. Beaty Jr. (R) since 2021.

===Taxation===

Property tax is assessed by the Ashley County Assessor annually based upon the fair market value of the property and determining which tax rate, commonly called a &quot;millage&quot; in Arkansas, will apply. The rate depends upon the property&#x27;s location with respect to city limits, school district, and special tax increment financing (TIF) districts. This tax is collected by the Ashley County Collector between the first business day of March of each year through October 15 without penalty. The Ashley County Treasurer disburses tax revenues to various government agencies, such as cities, county road departments, fire departments, libraries, and police departments in accordance with the budget set by the quorum court.

Sales and use taxes in Arkansas are voter approved and collected by the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration.
Arkansas&#x27;s statewide sales and use tax has been 6.5% since July 1, 2013. Ashley County has an additional sales and use tax of 1.50% since July 1, 2010. Within Ashley County, the City of Crossett has an additional 2.25% sales and use tax since January 1, 2014, and Fountain Hill, Hamburg, Portland, and Wilmot have a 1.00% sales and use tax rate. The Arkansas State Treasurer disburses tax revenue to counties/cities in accordance with tax rules.

==Communities==

Six incorporated cities and one town are located within the county. The largest city is Crossett, located in the southwest part of the county near the Ouachita River. Crossett&#x27;s population in 2010 was 5,507, but including the two adjacent unincorporated census designated places of North Crossett and West Crossett, the total population was 10,752 in 2010. The county seat, Hamburg is centrally located in the county and had a population of 2,857 at the 2010 Census. The four remaining cities are all located along US 165 in the eastern part of the county, and have populations below 1,000 people: Montrose, Parkdale, Portland, and Wilmot. The lone incorporated town, Fountain Hill, is located north of Hamburg and had a population of 175 in 2010.

Ashley County has dozens of unincorporated communities and ghost towns within its borders. This is due to early settlers in Arkansas tending to settle in small clusters rather than incorporated towns, especially along bayous or river landings in Ashley County. For example, communities like Longview and Milo had a post office or other buildings at some point in their history. Other communities are simply a few dwellings at a crossroads that have adopted a common place name over time. Some are officially listed as populated places by the United States Geological Survey, and others are listed as historic settlements.

==Infrastructure==
===Aviation===
The county contains one public owned/public use airport: Z. M. Jack Stell Field, a small, rural airport east of Crossett with over 16,000 annual operations, almost entirely agricultural spraying operations. Ashley County also contains five private airfields in the eastern part of the county.

===Major highways===

Ashley County is not served by any Interstate highways; the nearest access to the Interstate system is Interstate 20 (I-20) in Monroe, Louisiana. The county serves as a junction point for several US highways: US Highway 82 (US 82) crosses the county from west to east. This highway runs across South Arkansas, providing access to population centers including El Dorado, Magnolia, and Texarkana. The highway also has two special routes in Ashley County: a spur route to Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge and business route in Montrose. US 165 and US 425 cross the county from south to north, both run south into Louisiana, with the former running north through the Arkansas Delta to North Little Rock and the latter providing northbound connections to Monticello and Pine Bluff.

Eleven state highway designations serve the traveling public in the county, ranging from short connector routes to long highways traversing the entire county. Highway 8 east-west across the southern part of the state, entering Ashley County from Warren, passing through from northwest to southeast through Hamburg, and exiting Ashley County running east to Eudora. Highway 133 serves north–south traffic around Crossett. Highway 144, two segments of Highway 160, and three segments of Highway 52 provide east–west connectivity. Highway 169 and Highway 189 connect rural areas to Crossett and Hamburg, respectively. Highway 173 connects Overflow NWR to the state highway system. Highway 209 is a minor route in Parkdale.

===Utilities===

The Ashley-Chicot Electric Cooperative, based in Hamburg, is a non-profit electric utility cooperative serving the rural areas of Ashley County with electric service, as well as parts of adjacent counties. Entergy Arkansas provides electricity for the cities of Hamburg and Crossett and nearby populated outlying areas, and to the small communities along US 165.

The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) is responsible for the regulation and oversight of public water systems throughout the state. Ten community water systems are based in Ashley County: the Crossett Water Commission, Fountain Hill Waterworks, Hamburg Waterworks, Montrose/Boydell Water System, North Crossett Utilities, Northeast Crossett Water Association, Parkdale Waterworks, Portland Waterworks, Wilmot Waterworks, and the West Ashley County Water Association. All use groundwater as the source. The Crossett Water Commission has the largest direct retail population served (8,038, all in Ashley County), followed by Hamburg (5,481), and North Crossett Utilities (2,924). The remaining water systems have under 1,000 retail population served.

<text>Arkansas County, officially the County of Arkansas, is a county located in the U.S. state of Arkansas. As of the 2020 census, the population was 17,149. Located in the Arkansas Delta, the county has two county seats, DeWitt and Stuttgart. The first of the state&#x27;s 75 present-day counties to be created, Arkansas County was formed from New Madrid County on December 13, 1813, when this area was part of the Missouri Territory. The county was named after the Arkansas River (itself named for the Arkansas tribe), as was the subsequent Arkansas Territory which was later split off from Missouri Territory and eventually admitted to the union as a state. The riverfront areas in the Arkansas Delta were developed for cotton plantations that used enslaved African Americans. Cotton was the major commodity crop before and after the Civil War. Since then, the county lies within the largest rice-growing region in the United States. Arkansas County is one of seven present-day counties in the United States that have the same name as the state in which they are located.

==History==
===European settlement and conflict (1686–1804)===
Arkansas Post was the site of a colonial trading post, used for negotiating and trading with tribes to the west, all of whom were allies of the French. However, to the east, the Chickasaw and Choctaw were enemies of the French (the Chickasaw and Choctaw were allied to the British.) The tribe in the area who the French traded with the most were the Quapaw. On May 10, 1749, Arkansas Post was attacked by Chickasaw warriors. The Chickasaw burned the settlement, killed many men, and took women and children as captives. In response to the attack, the French moved the post to &quot;Ecores Rouges&quot;.

After the French were defeated in the French and Indian War, Louisiana was surrendered to the Spanish. However, they made no effort assert actual control over the province, and all Europeans present during the Spanish era were French fur traders who had simply stayed behind.

===Westward expansion and the Civil War (1804–1865)===

Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s French army conquered Spain, and Napoleon made his brother the new king of Spain. Napoleon&#x27;s brother, acting as king of Spain, then &quot;gave&quot; the Louisiana territory back to France. Arkansas County was created by the Missouri Territorial Legislature on December 31, 1813. It was called Arkansas after the Arkansas River, and the Arkansas tribe of Native Americans. It is one of seven current counties that have the same name as the state in which it is located.

Its original boundaries were New Madrid County to the north, Louisiana to the south, the Mississippi River to the east, and the Indian Boundary Line south of Fort Clark to the west. Arkansas County was within the Missouri Territory until creation of the Arkansas Territory on March 2, 1819. The county seat was moved from Arkansas Post to DeWitt, a newly established town created at the request of the Arkansas County Quorum Court on February 19, 1853. County government officially held court for the first time in DeWitt in October 1855.

This area was developed for cotton plantations through the antebellum period, based on the labor of enslaved African-American workers. Major planters earned considerable wealth with the commodity crop, for which there was high demand. Citizens of the county supported the Secession Convention to discuss secession from the Union in 1861 by an 80% to 20% margin. The anti-immediate secession delegates negotiated a compromise to put the question on the statewide ballot in August, but to remain in the Union.

Following President Lincoln&#x27;s 1861 militia call after the Confederate seizure of Fort Sumter, citizens of several counties (including Arkansas County) formed volunteer companies to capture the U.S. Arsenal at Little Rock. Arkansas County initially sent two companies to serve in what would become Company H (&quot;Crockett Rifles&quot;) and Company K (&quot;DeWitt Guards&quot;) of the First Arkansas Infantry Regiment. A third volunteer company (&quot;Dixie Grays&quot;) joined the Sixth Arkansas Infantry Regiment.

===Reconstruction and the 20th century (1865–1999)===

In the post-Reconstruction era, whites directed considerable violence against African Americans, in an effort to restore and maintain white supremacy after Democrats regained power. At the turn of the century, the state legislature passed measures that effectively disenfranchised most blacks for decades. The Equal Justice Initiative reported in 2015 that the county had 18 lynchings of African Americans from 1877 to 1950, most in the decades near the turn of the 20th century. This was the highest of any county other than Phillips, where the Elaine Race Riot is believed to have resulted in more than 200 deaths of African Americans.

To escape the violence and social oppression, thousands of African Americans left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities. They migrated beginning around World War I, increasing the number leaving during and after World War II, when rural jobs had been reduced.

==Geography==

Arkansas County is located in the Arkansas Delta (in Arkansas, usually referred to as &quot;the Delta&quot;) a subregion of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, which is a flat area consisting of rich, fertile sediment deposits from the Mississippi River between Louisiana and Illinois.
Within the Delta, Arkansas County is almost entirely within the Grand Prairie subregion, historically a flat grassland plain underlain by an impermeable clay layer (the Stuttgart soil series). Prior to the 19th century, flatter areas with slowly to very slowly permeable soils (often containing fragipans) supported Arkansas&#x27;s largest prairie, covered in prairie grasses and forbs, with oaks covering the low hills and ridges, and pockets of floodplains with bottomland hardwood forests. This region was a sharp contrast to the bottomland forests that once dominated other parts of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Cropland has now largely replaced the native vegetation. Distinctively, rice is the main crop; soybeans, cotton, corn, and wheat are also grown. The rice fields provide habitat and forage for large numbers and many species of waterfowl; duck and goose hunting occurs at this important spot along the Mississippi Flyway.

Two different eco-regions border the Grand Prairie along the major rivers forming the county&#x27;s east and southern boundaries: the Arkansas River Holocene Meander Belt and the Western Lowlands Holocene Meanders. These areas of flat floodplain contain the meander belts of the present and past watercourses, point bars, natural levees, swales, and abandoned river channels. Some of the most extensive remaining tracts of native bottomland hardwood forest in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain remain along these rivers. Along the banks of the White River in Arkansas County, these forests are preserved in the White River National Wildlife Refuge.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (4.4%) is water.

The county is located approximately east of Little Rock, southwest of Memphis, Tennessee, and northeast of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex (DFW) in Texas. Arkansas County is surrounded by Prairie County to the north, Monroe County to the northeast, Phillips County to the east, Desha County to the south, Lincoln County to the southwest, Jefferson County to the west, and Lonoke County to the northwest.

===Hydrology===
Water is an extremely important part of Arkansas County&#x27;s geography, history, economy, and culture. The many rivers, streams, and ditches crossing the county have featured prominently since prehistoric times, and many of the hundreds of archaeological sites, including the Menard–Hodges site, are along waterways. The navigability of the Arkansas River has been important for every civilization in Arkansas County since prehistory. Tribes of Quapaw, Casqui, and Mississippian cultures were settled in the area along the rivers. Three major rivers form much of the county&#x27;s boundaries: Arkansas River, Bayou Meto, and the White River. Within the county, La Grue Bayou is an important watercourse.

Rivers brought early prosperity to the county during white settlement for navigation. The county saw battles for control of the rivers during the American Revolution in 1783 at the Battle of Arkansas Post, and the Civil War in 1862 and 1863 in the Battle of Saint Charles and Battle of Arkansas Post, respectively.

===Protected areas===
Several agencies own and maintain areas of natural and cultural value for enjoyment and use by residents and visitors of Arkansas County. Along the county&#x27;s eastern boundary, of the Dale Bumpers White River National Wildlife Refuge protect Mississippi lowland forests along the White River. In the western part of the county, of the George H. Dunklin Jr. Bayou Meto Wildlife Management Area is managed by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission to preserve natural woodlands and wetlands for wintering waterfowl within the Mississippi Flyway. At the southern tip of the county, the bottomland hardwood forest area between the Arkansas and White is preserved in the Trusten Holder WMA. The area is well known for hunting and fishing, and bald eagle watching in winter. The AGFC also maintains the Ethel WMA, a area known for small game hunting, formerly open only to residents of Ethel.
The Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission maintains two small sites in Arkansas County: the Roth Prairie Natural Area and the Striplin Woods Natural Area. Roth Prairie is a flat plot south of Stuttgart, one of the few remaining tallgrass prairies typical of the Grand Prairie prior to leveling and clearing for human settlement. Striplin Woods preserves a very biodiverse section of old growth bottomland hardwood forest along the White River located within the White River NWR, and is comanaged with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Along the Arkansas, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains a total of 160 campgrounds at Merrisach, Notrebes Bend, Pendleton Bend, and Wilbur D. Mills Use Areas, each with electric hookups, boat ramps, and restroom facilities. The Corps also maintains the Moore Bayou Day Use Area on the Arkansas, providing access to the Arkansas Post Water Trail, and Wild Goose Bayou Day Use Area on the Arkansas Canal.

The primary cultural site in Arkansas County is Arkansas Post, the historic entrepot near the confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers, and early epicenter of European settlement in the region. Founded in 1686, Arkansas Post was established at various sites near the confluence, often moving after flood events. Though remains of the post have been lost by movements of the Arkansas River, a small townsite is preserved as the Arkansas Post National Memorial. The nearby Arkansas Post State Park preserves the history of early settlement on the Grand Prairie through a five-building museum. The central structure is the 1877 Refeld-Hinman dogtrot house.

==Demographics==
The peak of population in the rural county was 1940. Mechanization and industrial-scale agriculture reduced the number of farm workers, and people have moved away because of the lack of opportunities.

Arkansas County&#x27;s proportion of population holding a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher is 14.4%, significantly below the state average of 21.5% and national average of 30.3%.

====Primary and secondary education====

Two public school districts are based in Arkansas County: Stuttgart Public Schools is the larger of the two school districts in the county, with the DeWitt School District serving most of the rural area of the county. Successful completion of the curriculum of these schools leads to graduation from Stuttgart High School or DeWitt High School, respectively. Both high schools offer Advanced Placement (AP) courses and are accredited by the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE).

====Higher education====
Within Arkansas County, two branch campuses of Phillips Community College (based in Helena-West Helena) are operated in De Witt and Stuttgart. Public four-year colleges in the area include the University of Arkansas at Monticello in Monticello, University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) in Pine Bluff, and several institutions in Little Rock.

The nearest Level 1 Trauma Centers are University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and Arkansas Children&#x27;s Hospital (ACH) in Little Rock.

===Public safety===
The Arkansas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office is the primary law enforcement agency in the county. The agency is led by the Arkansas County Sheriff, an official elected by countywide vote every four years. Police departments in Stuttgart, DeWitt, Humphrey, Gillett, and Almyra provide law enforcement in their respective jurisdictions, with St. Charles contracting with the Arkansas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for law enforcement services.

The county is under the jurisdiction of two separate district courts, both local district courts of original jurisdiction for criminal, civil, small claims, and traffic matters. Local district courts are presided over by an elected part-time judge who may privately practice law. Arkansas County Northern District Court is held in Stuttgart. Arkansas County Southern District Court has departments in DeWitt, Gillett, and St. Charles.

Superseding district court jurisdiction is the 11th East Judicial Circuit Court, which covers all of Arkansas County. The 11th East Circuit contains one judge elected to a six-year term.

Fire protection, prevention and suppression is provided by eleven agencies in Arkansas County, together covering the entire county. The six incorporated municipalities each provide fire protection, in some cases extending beyond corporate limits. Rural areas are served by the Alcorn, Casscoe, Crockett&#x27;s Bluff, One Horse, and Tichnor volunteer fire departments. All fire departments in Arkansas County are volunteer-based, except the Stuttgart Fire Department.

==Culture and contemporary life==
Arkansas County has several facilities, monuments, and museums dedicated to preserving the history and culture of the area. Several historic log structures remain in the county from the pioneer era. Four facilities interpret the county&#x27;s natural heritage and unique position on the Grand Prairie, including Arkansas Post State Park, the Museum of the Grand Prairie in Stuttgart, the Potlatch Conservation Education Center in Casscoe, and the Visitor Center at White River NWR in St. Charles. Local history museums include the St. Charles Museum and the Museum of the Grand Prairie in Stuttgart.

Several National Register of Historic Places (NRHP, complete county list) properties in the county relate to Arkansas County&#x27;s rice heritage, including the A.M. Bohnert Rice Plantation Pump, L.A. Black Rice Milling Association Inc. Office, Tichnor Rice Dryer and Storage Building, and several contributing structures from the DeWitt Commercial Historic District and Stuttgart Commercial Historic District. Several buildings in these districts also were parts of the county&#x27;s economic and cultural history, including the Riceland Hotel and Standard Ice Company Building in downtown Stuttgart. History of government and public services in the county is preserved in both the Northern District and Southern District courthouses, DeWitt Post Office and Stuttgart Post Office, and the Old Gillett Jail.

Arkansas County hosts two farmer&#x27;s markets, offering fresh produce, baked goods and crafts: North Market at Main and Sixth streets in Stuttgart and South Market on Highway 165 in DeWitt. Both are open from May through October.

===Annual cultural events===
The most widely known annual cultural event in Arkansas County is the Gillett Coon Supper, described by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as &quot;a political rite of passage&quot; for those seeking public office in Arkansas. The meeting of local residents and politicians started in 1943 as a fundraiser serving boiled, and smoked raccoon for the Gillet High School football team, but has remained a tradition long after the school&#x27;s consolidation.
Perhaps the most popular annual event is duck hunting season between November and January, a tradition dating back to the Illinois Indians who traveled south to Arkansas to hunt. Popular with Arkansans and tourist hunters from across the country, annual hunting trips in Arkansas were first documented by French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet in 1673. Many hunts are organized through hunting clubs (like the historic Crocketts Bluff Hunting Lodge) and usually involve local guides for tourist groups. Public lands are very desirable and fill up quickly; many Arkansans seek to use private lands in Arkansas County to avoid crowds. In the 2016–17 season, the AGFC sold over 100,000 waterfowl stamps, roughly equally split between in-state and out-of-state hunters. The numbers include over 8,000 to out-of-state hunters to hunt on WMAs. Festivities begin during Thanksgiving Week with the World&#x27;s Championship Duck Calling Contest and Wings Over the Prairie Festival in Stuttgart.

The Arkansas County Fair has been held annually since 1938 at the Arkansas County Fairgrounds in DeWitt during mid-September.

===Media===
The county newspaper is the &quot;Stuttgart Daily Leader&quot;, a daily newspaper established in Stuttgart in 1885. Former newspapers include &quot;The Free Press&quot; and &quot;The Stuttgart Republican&quot;.

==Government==
The county government is a constitutional body granted specific powers by the Constitution of Arkansas and the Arkansas Code. The quorum court is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all spending and revenue collection. Representatives are called &quot;justices of the peace&quot; and are elected from county districts every even-numbered year. The number of districts in a county vary from nine to fifteen, and district boundaries are drawn by the county election commission. The Arkansas County Quorum Court has eight members. Presiding over quorum court meetings is the &quot;county judge&quot;, who serves as the chief operating officer of the county. The county judge is elected at-large and does not vote in quorum court business, although capable of vetoing quorum court decisions.

==Politics==
Over the past few election cycles Arkansas county has trended heavily towards the GOP. The last Democrat (as of 2024) to carry this county was Arkansas native Bill Clinton in 1996.












===Taxation===

Property tax is assessed by the Arkansas County Assessor annually based upon the fair market value of the property and determining which tax rate, commonly called a &quot;millage&quot; in Arkansas, will apply. The rate depends upon the property&#x27;s location with respect to city limits, school district, and special tax increment financing (TIF) districts. This tax is collected by the Arkansas County Collector between the first business day of March of each year through October 15 without penalty. The Arkansas County Treasurer disburses tax revenues to various government agencies, such as cities, county road departments, fire departments, libraries, and police departments in accordance with the budget set by the quorum court.

Sales and use taxes in Arkansas are voter approved and collected by the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration.
Arkansas&#x27;s statewide sales and use tax has been 6.5% since July 1, 2013. Arkansas County has an additional sales and use tax of 1.0%, which has been in effect since January 1, 1998. Within Arkansas County, Almyra and Humphrey have an additional tax of 1.0%, St. Charles has an additional 2.0%, Gillett and Stuttgart an additional 3.0%, and DeWitt an additional 3.5% on top of county rates. The Arkansas State Treasurer disburses tax revenue to counties/cities in accordance with tax rules.

==Communities==

Four incorporated cities and two incorporated towns are located within the county. Each has seen steady population decline over recent decades. The largest city and northern district county seat, Stuttgart, is located in the north part of the county near the Prairie County line. Stuttgart&#x27;s population in 2010 was 9,326, and has been declining steadily since a peak of 10,941 at the 1980 Census. DeWitt, centrally located in Arkansas County, is the southern district county seat and second-largest city in the county with a population of 3,292 in 2010. The remaining communities each have populations under 750 as of 2010; Humphrey is partially located in Jefferson County on Arkansas County&#x27;s western edge, St. Charles is on the White River in the eastern portion of the county, and Gillett in southern Arkansas County. Almyra is located along Highway 130 between DeWitt and Stuttgart.

===Unincorporated communities===
Arkansas County has dozens of unincorporated communities and ghost towns within its borders. This is due to early settlers in Arkansas tending to settle in small clusters rather than incorporated towns. For example, communities like Ethel have a post office or central density of buildings at some point in their history. Other communities are simply a few dwellings at a crossroads that have adopted a common place name over time. Some are officially listed as populated places by the United States Geological Survey, and others are listed as historic settlements.

<text>Heme (American English), or haem (Commonwealth English, both pronounced // ), is a ring-shaped iron-containing molecular component of hemoglobin, which is necessary to bind oxygen in the bloodstream. It is composed of four pyrrole rings with 2 vinyl and 2 propionic acid side chains. Heme is biosynthesized in both the bone marrow and the liver.

Heme plays a critical role in multiple different redox reactions in mammals, due to its ability to carry the oxygen molecule. Reactions include oxidative metabolism (cytochrome c oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase), xenobiotic detoxification via cytochrome P450 pathways (including metabolism of some drugs), gas sensing (guanyl cyclases, nitric oxide synthase), and microRNA processing (DGCR8).

Heme is a coordination complex &quot;consisting of an iron ion coordinated to a tetrapyrrole acting as a tetradentate ligand, and to one or two axial ligands&quot;. The definition is loose, and many depictions omit the axial ligands. Among the metalloporphyrins deployed by metalloproteins as prosthetic groups, heme is one of the most widely used and defines a family of proteins known as hemoproteins. Hemes are most commonly recognized as components of hemoglobin, the red pigment in blood, but are also found in a number of other biologically important hemoproteins such as myoglobin, cytochromes, catalases, heme peroxidase, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. 

The word &quot;haem&quot; is derived from Greek &quot;haima&quot; &#x27;blood&#x27;.
==Function==
Hemoproteins have diverse biological functions including the transportation of diatomic gases, chemical catalysis, diatomic gas detection, and electron transfer. The heme iron serves as a source or sink of electrons during electron transfer or redox chemistry. In peroxidase reactions, the porphyrin molecule also serves as an electron source, being able to delocalize radical electrons in the conjugated ring. In the transportation or detection of diatomic gases, the gas binds to the heme iron. During the detection of diatomic gases, the binding of the gas ligand to the heme iron induces conformational changes in the surrounding protein. In general, diatomic gases only bind to the reduced heme, as ferrous Fe(II) while most peroxidases cycle between Fe(III) and Fe(IV) and hemeproteins involved in mitochondrial redox, oxidation-reduction, cycle between Fe(II) and Fe(III).

It has been speculated that the original evolutionary function of hemoproteins was electron transfer in primitive sulfur-based photosynthesis pathways in ancestral cyanobacteria-like organisms before the appearance of molecular oxygen.

Hemoproteins achieve their remarkable functional diversity by modifying the environment of the heme macrocycle within the protein matrix. For example, the ability of hemoglobin to effectively deliver oxygen to tissues is due to specific amino acid residues located near the heme molecule. Hemoglobin reversibly binds to oxygen in the lungs when the pH is high, and the carbon dioxide concentration is low. When the situation is reversed (low pH and high carbon dioxide concentrations), hemoglobin will release oxygen into the tissues. This phenomenon, which states that hemoglobin&#x27;s oxygen binding affinity is inversely proportional to both acidity and concentration of carbon dioxide, is known as the Bohr effect. The molecular mechanism behind this effect is the steric organization of the globin chain; a histidine residue, located adjacent to the heme group, becomes positively charged under acidic conditions (which are caused by dissolved CO2 in working muscles, etc.), releasing oxygen from the heme group.

==Types==
===Major hemes===
There are several biologically important kinds of heme:


The most common type is &quot;heme B&quot;; other important types include &quot;heme A&quot; and &quot;heme C&quot;. Isolated hemes are commonly designated by capital letters while hemes bound to proteins are designated by lower case letters. Cytochrome a refers to the heme A in specific combination with membrane protein forming a portion of cytochrome c oxidase.

===Other hemes===
:&quot;The following carbon numbering system of porphyrins is an older numbering used by biochemists and not the 1–24 numbering system recommended by IUPAC, which is shown in the table above.&quot;
*Heme &quot;l&quot; is the derivative of heme B which is covalently attached to the protein of lactoperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, and thyroid peroxidase. The addition of peroxide with the glutamyl-375 and aspartyl-225 of lactoperoxidase forms ester bonds between these amino acid residues and the heme 1- and 5-methyl groups, respectively. Similar ester bonds with these two methyl groups are thought to form in eosinophil and thyroid peroxidases. Heme &quot;l&quot; is one important characteristic of animal peroxidases; plant peroxidases incorporate heme B. Lactoperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase are protective enzymes responsible for the destruction of invading bacteria and virus. Thyroid peroxidase is the enzyme catalyzing the biosynthesis of the important thyroid hormones. Because lactoperoxidase destroys invading organisms in the lungs and excrement, it is thought to be an important protective enzyme.
*Heme &quot;m&quot; is the derivative of heme B covalently bound at the active site of myeloperoxidase. Heme &quot;m&quot; contains the two ester bonds at the heme 1- and 5-methyl groups also present in heme &quot;l&quot; of other mammalian peroxidases, such as lactoperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase. In addition, a unique sulfonamide ion linkage between the sulfur of a methionyl amino-acid residue and the heme 2-vinyl group is formed, giving this enzyme the unique capability of easily oxidizing chloride and bromide ions to hypochlorite and hypobromite. Myeloperoxidase is present in mammalian neutrophils and is responsible for the destruction of invading bacteria and viral agents. It perhaps synthesizes hypobromite by &quot;mistake&quot;. Both hypochlorite and hypobromite are very reactive species responsible for the production of halogenated nucleosides, which are mutagenic compounds.
*Heme D is another derivative of heme B, but in which the propionic acid side chain at the carbon of position 6, which is also hydroxylated, forms a γ-spirolactone. Ring III is also hydroxylated at position 5, in a conformation &quot;trans&quot; to the new lactone group. Heme D is the site for oxygen reduction to water of many types of bacteria at low oxygen tension.
*Heme S is related to heme B by having a formyl group at position 2 in place of the 2-vinyl group. Heme S is found in the hemoglobin of a few species of marine worms. The correct structures of heme B and heme S were first elucidated by German chemist Hans Fischer.

The names of cytochromes typically (but not always) reflect the kinds of hemes they contain: cytochrome a contains heme A, cytochrome c contains heme C, etc. This convention may have been first introduced with the publication of the structure of heme A.

===Use of capital letters to designate the type of heme===
The practice of designating hemes with upper case letters was formalized in a footnote in a paper by Puustinen and Wikstrom, which explains under which conditions a capital letter should be used: &quot;we prefer the use of capital letters to describe the heme structure as isolated. Lowercase letters may then be freely used for cytochromes and enzymes, as well as to describe individual protein-bound heme groups (for example, cytochrome bc, and aa3 complexes, cytochrome b5, heme c1 of the bc1 complex, heme a3 of the aa3 complex, etc).&quot; In other words, the chemical compound would be designated with a capital letter, but specific instances in structures with lowercase. Thus cytochrome oxidase, which has two A hemes (heme a and heme a3) in its structure, contains two moles of heme A per mole protein. Cytochrome bc1, with hemes bH, bL, and c1, contains heme B and heme C in a 2:1 ratio. The practice seems to have originated in a paper by Caughey and York in which the product of a new isolation procedure for the heme of cytochrome aa3 was designated heme A to differentiate it from previous preparations: &quot;Our product is not identical in all respects with the heme a obtained in solution by other workers by the reduction of the hemin a as isolated previously (2). For this reason, we shall designate our product heme A until the apparent differences can be rationalized.&quot; In a later paper, Caughey&#x27;s group uses capital letters for isolated heme B and C as well as A.

==Synthesis==


The enzymatic process that produces heme is properly called porphyrin synthesis, as all the intermediates are tetrapyrroles that are chemically classified as porphyrins. The process is highly conserved across biology. In humans, this pathway serves almost exclusively to form heme. In bacteria, it also produces more complex substances such as cofactor F430 and cobalamin (vitamin B12).

The pathway is initiated by the synthesis of δ-aminolevulinic acid (dALA or δALA) from the amino acid glycine and succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). The rate-limiting enzyme responsible for this reaction, &quot;ALA synthase&quot;, is negatively regulated by glucose and heme concentration. Mechanism of inhibition of ALAs by heme or hemin is by decreasing stability of mRNA synthesis and by decreasing the intake of mRNA in the mitochondria. This mechanism is of therapeutic importance: infusion of &quot;heme arginate&quot; or &quot;hematin&quot; and glucose can abort attacks of acute intermittent porphyria in patients with an inborn error of metabolism of this process, by reducing transcription of ALA synthase.

The organs mainly involved in heme synthesis are the liver (in which the rate of synthesis is highly variable, depending on the systemic heme pool) and the bone marrow (in which rate of synthesis of Heme is relatively constant and depends on the production of globin chain), although every cell requires heme to function properly. However, due to its toxic properties, proteins such as emopexin (Hx) are required to help maintain physiological stores of iron in order for them to be used in synthesis. Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism of hemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism. Defects in various enzymes in synthesis of heme can lead to group of disorder called porphyrias, which include acute intermittent porphyria, congenital erythropoetic porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, and erythropoietic protoporphyria.

==Synthesis for food==
Impossible Foods, producers of plant-based meat substitutes, use an accelerated heme synthesis process involving soybean root leghemoglobin and yeast, adding the resulting heme to items such as meatless (vegan) Impossible burger patties. The DNA for leghemoglobin production was extracted from the soybean root nodules and expressed in yeast cells to overproduce heme for use in the meatless burgers. This process claims to create a meaty flavor in the resulting products.

==Degradation==
Degradation begins inside macrophages of the spleen, which remove old and damaged erythrocytes from the circulation.

In the first step, heme is converted to biliverdin by the enzyme heme oxygenase (HO). NADPH is used as the reducing agent, molecular oxygen enters the reaction, carbon monoxide (CO) is produced and the iron is released from the molecule as the ferrous ion (Fe2+). CO acts as a cellular messenger and functions in vasodilation.

In addition, heme degradation appears to be an evolutionarily-conserved response to oxidative stress. Briefly, when cells are exposed to free radicals, there is a rapid induction of the expression of the stress-responsive heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) isoenzyme that catabolizes heme (see below). The reason why cells must increase exponentially their capability to degrade heme in response to oxidative stress remains unclear but this appears to be part of a cytoprotective response that avoids the deleterious effects of free heme. When large amounts of free heme accumulates, the heme detoxification/degradation systems get overwhelmed, enabling heme to exert its damaging effects.

In the second reaction, biliverdin is converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (BVR):

Bilirubin is transported into the liver by facilitated diffusion bound to a protein (serum albumin), where it is conjugated with glucuronic acid to become more water-soluble. The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase.
This form of bilirubin is excreted from the liver in bile. Excretion of bilirubin from liver to biliary canaliculi is an active, energy-dependent and rate-limiting process. The intestinal bacteria deconjugate bilirubin diglucuronide releasing free bilirubin, which can either be reabsorbed or reduced to urobilinogen by the bacterial enzyme bilirubin reductase. 

Some urobilinogen is absorbed by intestinal cells and transported into the kidneys and excreted with urine (urobilin, which is the product of oxidation of urobilinogen, and is responsible for the yellow colour of urine). The remainder travels down the digestive tract and is converted to stercobilinogen. This is oxidized to stercobilin, which is excreted and is responsible for the brown color of feces.

==In health and disease==
Under homeostasis, the reactivity of heme is controlled by its insertion into the &quot;heme pockets&quot; of hemoproteins. Under oxidative stress however, some hemoproteins, e.g. hemoglobin, can release their heme prosthetic groups. The non-protein-bound (free) heme produced in this manner becomes highly cytotoxic, most probably due to the iron atom contained within its protoporphyrin IX ring, which can act as a Fenton&#x27;s reagent to catalyze in an unfettered manner the production of free radicals. It catalyzes the oxidation and aggregation of protein, the formation of cytotoxic lipid peroxide via lipid peroxidation and damages DNA through oxidative stress. Due to its lipophilic properties, it impairs lipid bilayers in organelles such as mitochondria and nuclei. These properties of free heme can sensitize a variety of cell types to undergo programmed cell death in response to pro-inflammatory agonists, a deleterious effect that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of certain inflammatory diseases such as malaria and sepsis. 

===Cancer===
There is an association between high intake of heme iron sourced from meat and increased risk of colorectal cancer.

The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and World Cancer Research Fund International (WCRF) concluded in a 2018 report that there is limited but suggestive evidence that foods containing heme iron increase risk of colorectal cancer. A 2019 review found that heme iron intake is associated with increased breast cancer risk.

==Genes==
The following genes are part of the chemical pathway for making heme:

*&quot;ALAD&quot;: aminolevulinic acid, δ-, dehydratase (deficiency causes ala-dehydratase deficiency porphyria)
*&quot;ALAS1&quot;: aminolevulinate, δ-, synthase 1
*&quot;ALAS2&quot;: aminolevulinate, δ-, synthase 2 (deficiency causes sideroblastic/hypochromic anemia)
*&quot;CPOX&quot;: coproporphyrinogen oxidase (deficiency causes hereditary coproporphyria)
*&quot;FECH&quot;: ferrochelatase (deficiency causes erythropoietic protoporphyria)
*&quot;HMBS&quot;: hydroxymethylbilane synthase (deficiency causes acute intermittent porphyria)
*&quot;PPOX&quot;: protoporphyrinogen oxidase (deficiency causes variegate porphyria)
*&quot;UROD&quot;: uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (deficiency causes porphyria cutanea tarda)
*&quot;UROS&quot;: uroporphyrinogen III synthase (deficiency causes congenital erythropoietic porphyria)

<doc id="97507" wikidata="Q449114" url="?curid=97507" title="Laura Ashley">
<text>Laura Ashley (née Mountney; 7 September 1925 – 17 September 1985) was a Welsh fashion designer and businesswoman. She originally made furnishing materials in the 1950s, expanding the business into clothing design and manufacture in the 1960s. The Laura Ashley style is characterised by Romantic designs – often with a 19th-century rural feel – and the use of natural fabrics.

==Early life==
Ashley was born at her grandmother&#x27;s home, 31 Station Terrace, Dowlais, Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. She was raised in a civil service family as a Strict Baptist. The chapel she attended in Dowlais (Hebron) was Welsh language and although she could not understand it, she loved it, especially the singing. Educated at Marshall&#x27;s School in Merthyr Tydfil until 1932, she was then sent to the Elmwood School, Croydon. She was evacuated back to Wales aged 13, but with so many World War II evacuees there were no school places left and she attended Aberdare Secretarial School.

An apron that purports to be the first garment made by her when a teenager hangs in the dining room of the Llangoed Hall Hotel near Brecon in Powys.

In 1942, at age 16, she left school and served in the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service. During this period she met engineer Bernard Ashley at a youth club in Wallington. After the war, Bernard was posted to India with the Gurkhas, and the pair corresponded by letter. From 1945 to 1952, she worked as a secretary for the National Federation of Women&#x27;s Institutes in London, marrying Bernard in 1949.

==The company==

While working as a secretary and raising her first two children, Ashley undertook some development work for the Women&#x27;s Institute on quilting. Revisiting the craft she had learnt with her grandmother, she began designing headscarves, napkins, table mats and tea-towels which Bernard printed on a machine he had designed in their attic flat at 83 Cambridge Street, Pimlico, London.

The couple had invested £10 in wood for the screen frame, dyes and a few yards of linen. Ashley&#x27;s inspiration to start producing printed fabric came from a Women&#x27;s Institute display of traditional handicrafts at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. When Ashley looked for small patches carrying Victorian designs to help her make patchworks, she found no such thing existed. Here was an opportunity, and she started to print Victorian style headscarves in 1953.

The scarves quickly became successful – retailing both via mail order and at high street chains such as John Lewis – and Bernard left his City job to print fabrics full-time. The company was originally registered as Ashley Mountney (Laura&#x27;s maiden name), but Bernard changed the name to Laura Ashley because he felt a woman&#x27;s name was more appropriate for the type of products they were producing. The new company moved to Kent in 1955, but when the third of their four children was born, the family moved to Wales in 1960.

Laura Ashley&#x27;s first shop was opened at 35 Maengwyn Street, Machynlleth, Montgomeryshire, in 1961. 
==Personal life==
Laura and Bernard Ashley had four children who were all involved with the business. David (born 1954/55), the eldest son, designed the shops; one of the daughters, Jane, was the company photographer; another daughter, Emma, and their second son, Nick, were part of the company&#x27;s fashion design team. Bernard was the company chairman and Laura kept a close eye on fabrics. The success of the business meant that the Ashleys could afford a yacht, a private plane, the French Château de Remaisnil in Picardy, Rhydoldog House, a mansion near Rhayader, Powys, Wales,&lt;ref name=&quot;housebeautiful/a27330585&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shropshirestar/singer-bought-ashley&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thenational.wales/19812490&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a town-house in Brussels, and the villa &quot;Contenta&quot; in Lyford Cay, New Providence, Bahamas.

===Death===
In 1985, just after her 60th birthday, Laura Ashley fell down the stairs of her daughter&#x27;s home in the West Midlands and was taken to hospital in Coventry, where she died ten days later of a brain haemorrhage. She is buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist, in Carno, Wales.

==Legacy==
Two months after her death in 1985, Laura Ashley Holdings went public in a flotation that was 34 times oversubscribed. A memorial plaque to Laura Ashley, at the family&#x27;s former home 83 Cambridge Street, Pimlico was unveiled on 5 July 1994.

Sir Bernard Ashley died of cancer on 14 February 2009.

==Foundation==
The Laura Ashley Foundation was set up in 1987; as the Foundation has been run by the late Sir Bernard and their children, the strategy has evolved from purely funding the arts to also funding broader community and social welfare projects. It was this evolution that prompted the change of name in 2011 from The Laura Ashley Foundation to The Ashley Family Foundation.

<doc id="97509" wikidata="Q173196" url="?curid=97509" title="Michael Collins (Irish leader)">
<text>Michael Collins (; 16 October 1890 – 22 August 1922) was an Irish revolutionary, soldier and politician who was a leading figure in the early-20th century struggle for Irish independence. During the War of Independence he was Director of Intelligence of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and a government minister of the self-declared Irish Republic. He was then Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State from January 1922 and commander-in-chief of the National Army from July until his death in an ambush in August 1922, during the Civil War.

Collins was born in Woodfield, County Cork, the youngest of eight children. He moved to London in 1906 to become a clerk in the Post Office Savings Bank at Blythe House. He was a member of the London GAA, through which he became associated with the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Gaelic League. He returned to Ireland in January 1916 and fought in the Easter Rising. He was taken prisoner and held in the Frongoch internment camp as a prisoner of war, but he was released in December 1916.

Collins subsequently rose through the ranks of the Irish Volunteers and Sinn Féin. He was elected as MP for South Cork in December 1918. Sinn Féin&#x27;s elected members (later known as TDs) formed an Irish parliament, the First Dáil, in January 1919 and declared the independence of the Irish Republic. Collins was appointed Minister for Finance. In the ensuing War of Independence, he was Director of Organisation and Adjutant General for the Irish Volunteers, and Director of Intelligence of the IRA. He gained fame as a guerrilla warfare strategist, planning many successful attacks on British forces together with &#x27;the Squad&#x27;, such as the &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; assassinations of key British intelligence agents in November 1920.

After the July 1921 ceasefire, Collins was one of five plenipotentiaries sent by the Dáil cabinet at the request of Éamon de Valera, to negotiate peace terms in London. The resulting Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed in December 1921, would establish the Irish Free State but depended on an oath of allegiance to the Crown. This was the clause in the treaty de Valera and other republican leaders found most difficult to accept. Collins viewed the treaty as offering &quot;the freedom to achieve freedom&quot;, and helped persuade a majority of the Dáil to ratify the treaty. A provisional government was formed under his chairmanship in early 1922. During this time he secretly provided support for an IRA offensive in Northern Ireland. It was soon disrupted by the Irish Civil War, in which Collins was commander-in-chief of the National Army. He was shot and killed in an ambush by anti-Treaty forces in August 1922.

==Early years==
Collins was born in Woodfield, Sam&#x27;s Cross, near Rosscarbery, County Cork, on 16 October 1890, the third son and youngest of eight children. His father, Michael John (1815–1897), was a farmer and amateur mathematician, who had been a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) movement. The elder Collins was 60 years old when he married Mary Anne O&#x27;Brien, then 23, in 1876. The marriage was apparently happy. They brought up eight children on a farm called Woodfield, which the Collins family had held as tenants for several generations. Michael was six and a half years old when his father died. After the death of her husband, Mary Anne had the small family home rebuilt in 1899–1900 as Woodfield House, a much larger dwelling. Michael Collins (the younger) believed his family were descendants of the Uí Chonaill Gabra. 
He was a bright and precocious child with a fiery temper and a passionate feeling of Irish patriotism. He named a local blacksmith, James Santry, and his headmaster at Lisavaird National School, Denis Lyons, as the first nationalists to personally inspire his &quot;pride of Irishness&quot;. Lyons was a member of the IRB, while Santry&#x27;s family had participated in, and forged arms for, the rebellions of 1798, 1848 and 1867. There are a number of anecdotal explanations for the origin of his nickname &quot;the Big Fellow&quot;. His family claim that he was called this as a child, as a term of endearment for an adventurous and bold youngest brother. The nickname was established in his teens, long before he became a political or military leader.

At the age of thirteen he attended Clonakilty National School. During the week he stayed with his sister Margaret Collins-O&#x27;Driscoll and her husband Patrick O&#x27;Driscoll, while at weekends he returned to the family farm. Patrick O&#x27;Driscoll founded the newspaper &quot;West Cork People&quot; and Collins helped out with general reporting and preparing the issues.

Leaving school at fifteen, Collins took the British Civil Service examination in Cork in February 1906 and moved to the home of his sister Hannie in London, where he became a boy clerk in the Post Office Savings Bank at Blythe House. In 1910 he became a messenger at a London firm of stockbrokers, Horne and Company. While living in London he studied law at King&#x27;s College London but did not finish. He joined the London GAA and, through this, the IRB. Sam Maguire, a republican from Dunmanway, County Cork, introduced the 19-year-old Collins to the IRB. In 1915 he moved to work in the Guaranty Trust Company of New York where he remained until his return to Ireland the following year joining part-time &quot;Craig Gardiner &amp; Co&quot;, a firm of accountants in Dawson Street, Dublin.

==Easter Rising==


The struggle for Home Rule, along with labour unrest, had led to the formation in 1913 of two major nationalist paramilitary groups which later launched the Easter Rising: the Irish Citizen Army was established by James Connolly, James Larkin and his Irish Transport and General Workers Union (ITGWU) to protect strikers from the Dublin Metropolitan Police during the 1913 Dublin Lockout. The Irish Volunteers were created in the same year by nationalists in response to the formation of the Ulster Volunteers (UVF), an Ulster loyalist body pledged to oppose Home Rule by force.

An organiser of considerable intelligence, Collins had become highly respected in the IRB. This led to his appointment as financial advisor to Count Plunkett, father of one of the Easter Rising&#x27;s organisers, Joseph Plunkett. Collins took part in preparing arms and drilling troops for the insurrection.

The Rising was Collins&#x27; first appearance in national events. When it commenced on Easter Monday 1916, Collins served as Joseph Plunkett&#x27;s aide-de-camp and bodyguard at the rebellion&#x27;s headquarters in the General Post Office (GPO) in Dublin. There he fought alongside Patrick Pearse, James Connolly and other members of the Rising leadership. The Rising was put down after six days, but the insurgents achieved their goal of holding their positions for the minimum time required to justify a claim to independence under international criteria.

Following the surrender, Collins was arrested and taken into British custody. He was processed at Dublin&#x27;s Richmond Barracks by &quot;G-Men&quot;, plain-clothes officers from Dublin Metropolitan Police. During his screening, Collins was identified as someone who should be selected for further interrogation, harsher treatment or execution. However, he overheard his name being called out so he moved to the other side of the building to identify the speaker. In doing so, he joined the group that was later transferred to Frongoch internment camp in Wales after two months captivity in Stafford Gaol. Historian Tim Pat Coogan describes Collins&#x27; fortuitous move across the detention room in Richmond Barracks as &quot;one of the luckiest escapes of his life&quot;.

Collins first began to emerge as a major figure in the vacuum created by the executions of the 1916 leadership. He began hatching plans for &quot;next time&quot; even before the prison ships left Dublin.

At Frongoch he was one of the organisers of a programme of protest and non-cooperation with authorities. The camp proved an excellent opportunity for networking with physical-force republicans from all over the country, of which he became a key organiser.

While some celebrated the fact that a rising had happened at all, believing in Pearse&#x27;s theory of &quot;blood sacrifice&quot; (namely that the deaths of the Rising&#x27;s leaders would inspire others), Collins railed against the military blunders made. He cited the seizure of indefensible and very vulnerable positions like St Stephen&#x27;s Green which were impossible to escape from and difficult to supply. Public outcry placed pressure on the British government to end the internment and, in December 1916, the Frongoch prisoners were sent home.

==1917–1918==
Before his death, Tom Clarke, first signatory of the 1916 Proclamation and widely considered the Rising&#x27;s foremost organiser, had designated his wife Kathleen Clarke as the official caretaker of Rising official business, in the event that the leadership did not survive. By June 1916, Mrs. Clarke had sent out the first post-Rising communiqué to the IRB, declaring the Rising to be only the beginning and directing nationalists to prepare for &quot;the next blow&quot;. Soon after his release Mrs. Clarke appointed Collins Secretary to the National Aid and Volunteers Dependents Fund and subsequently passed on to him the secret organisational information and contacts which she had held in trust for the independence movement.

Collins became one of the leading figures in the post-Rising independence movement spearheaded by Arthur Griffith, editor/publisher of the main nationalist newspaper The United Irishman, (which Collins had read avidly as a boy.) Griffith&#x27;s organisation Sinn Féin was founded in 1905 as an umbrella group to unify all the various factions within the nationalist movement.

Under Griffith&#x27;s policy, Collins and other advocates of the &quot;physical-force&quot; approach to independence gained the cooperation of Sinn Féin, while agreeing to disagree with Griffith&#x27;s moderate ideas of a dual monarchy solution based on the Hungarian model. The British government and mainstream Irish media had wrongly blamed Sinn Féin for the Rising. This attracted Rising participants to join the organisation in order to exploit the reputation with which such British propaganda had imbued the organisation. By October 1917 Collins had risen to become a member of the executive of Sinn Féin and director of organisation for the Irish Volunteers. Éamon de Valera, another veteran of 1916, stood for the presidency of Sinn Féin against Griffith, who stepped aside and supported de Valera&#x27;s presidency.

==First Dáil==
In the 1918 general election Sinn Féin swept the polls throughout much of Ireland, with many seats uncontested, and formed an overwhelming parliamentary majority in Ireland. Like many senior Sinn Féin representatives Collins was elected as an MP (for Cork South) with the right to sit in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in London. Unlike their rivals in the Irish Parliamentary Party, Sinn Féin MPs had announced that they would not take their seats in Westminster but instead would set up an Irish Parliament in Dublin.

Before the new body&#x27;s first meeting, Collins, tipped off by his network of spies, warned his colleagues of plans to arrest all its members in overnight raids. De Valera and others ignored the warnings on the argument that, if the arrests happened, they would constitute a propaganda coup. The intelligence proved accurate and de Valera, along with Sinn Féin MPs who followed his advice, were arrested; Collins and others evaded incarceration. Collins reportedly spent time hiding among Dublin&#x27;s Jewish community, even posing as an Orthodox Jew and once cursing at the Black and Tans in his best imitation of Yiddish.

The new parliament, called Dáil Éireann (meaning &quot;Assembly of Ireland&quot;, see First Dáil) met in the Mansion House, Dublin in January 1919. In de Valera&#x27;s absence, Cathal Brugha was elected Príomh Aire (&#x27;First&#x27; or &#x27;Prime&#x27; Minister but often translated as &#x27;President of Dáil Éireann&#x27;). The following April, Collins engineered de Valera&#x27;s escape from Lincoln Prison in England, after which Brugha was replaced by de Valera.

No state gave diplomatic recognition to the Irish Republic, despite sustained lobbying in Washington by de Valera and prominent Irish-Americans and at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.

==Minister for Finance==
De Valera appointed Collins as Minister for Finance in the Ministry of Dáil Éireann in 1919. At this time, most of the Dáil Éireann&#x27;s ministries existed only on paper or as one or two individuals working in a room of a private house, as large gatherings of Irish republican politicians would be vulnerable to raid attempts by British Crown forces.

Despite that, Collins managed to produce a Finance Ministry that was able to organise a large bond issue in the form of a &quot;National Loan&quot; to fund the new Irish Republic. According to Batt O&#x27;Connor, the Dáil Loan raised almost £400,000, of which £25,000 was in gold. The loan, which was declared illegal by the British, was lodged in the individual bank accounts of the trustees. The gold was kept under the floor of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s house until 1922. The Russian Republic, in the midst of its own civil war, ordered Ludwig Martens the head of the Soviet Bureau in New York City to acquire a &quot;national loan&quot; from the Irish Republic through Harry Boland, offering some jewels as collateral. The jewels remained in a Dublin house until 1938, when they were handed over to de Valera.

==War of Independence==
The Irish War of Independence in effect began on the day that the First Dáil convened, 21 January 1919. On that date, an ambush party of IRA Volunteers from the 3rd Tipperary Brigade including Séumas Robinson, Dan Breen, Seán Treacy and Seán Hogan, attacked a pair of Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) men who were escorting a consignment of gelignite to a quarry in Soloheadbeg, County Tipperary. The two policemen were shot dead during the engagement, known as the Soloheadbeg ambush. This ambush is considered the first action in the Irish War of Independence. The engagement had no advance authorisation from the nascent government. The legislature&#x27;s support for the armed struggle soon after became official, with the Dáil ratifying the IRA&#x27;s claim to be the army of the Irish Republic. From that time Collins filled a number of roles in addition to his legislative duties. 
On 7 April 1919, Eamon Broy smuggled Collins into G Division&#x27;s archives in Great Brunswick Street, enabling him to identify &quot;G-Men&quot;, six of whom would be killed by the IRA. That summer he was elected president of the IRB (and therefore, in the doctrine of that organisation, President of the Irish Republic). In mid-1919, he was made Director of Intelligence for the Irish Republican Army which now had a mandate to pursue an armed campaign, as the official military of the Irish nation. With Cathal Brugha as Minister of Defence, Collins became Director of Organisation and Adjutant General of the Volunteers. Collins spent much of this period helping to organise the Volunteers as an effective military force, and concentrating on forcing the RIC – which represented British authority in Ireland – out of isolated barracks and seizing their weapons. Collins was determined to avoid the massive destruction, military and civilian losses for merely symbolic victories that had characterised the 1916 Rising. Instead, he directed a guerrilla war against the British, suddenly attacking and then just as quickly withdrawing, minimising losses and maximising effectiveness.

The Crown responded with an escalation of the war, with the importation of special forces such as the &quot;Auxiliaries&quot;, the &quot;Black and Tans&quot;, the &quot;Cairo Gang&quot;, and others. Officially or unofficially, many of these groups were given a free hand to institute a reign of terror, shooting Irish people indiscriminately, invading homes, looting and burning.

As the war began in earnest, de Valera travelled to the United States for an extended speaking tour to raise funds for the outlawed Republican government. It was in publicity for this tour that de Valera (who had been elected Príomh Aire by the Dáil) was first referred to as &quot;President&quot;. While financially successful, grave political conflicts followed in de Valera&#x27;s wake there which threatened the unity of Irish-American support for the rebels. Some members of the IRB also objected to the use of the presidential title because their organisation&#x27;s constitution had a different definition of that title.

Back in Ireland, Collins arranged the &quot;National Loan&quot;, organised the IRA, effectively led the government, and managed arms-smuggling operations. Robert Briscoe, an Irish Jew was sent by Collins to Germany in 1919 to be the chief agent for procuring arms for the IRA. While in Germany in 1921 Briscoe purchased a small tug boat named Frieda to be used in transporting guns and ammunition to Ireland. On 28 October 1921 the Frieda slipped out to sea with Charles McGuinness at the helm and a German crew with a cargo of leftover World War I weapons – 300 guns and 20,000 rounds of ammunition. Other sources cite this shipment as &quot;the largest military shipment ever to reach the I.R.A.&quot; consisting of 1,500 rifles, 2,000 pistols and 1.7 million rounds of ammunition smuggled hidden in potatoes. Local guerrilla units received supplies, training and had largely a free hand to develop the war in their own region. These were the &quot;flying columns&quot; who comprised the bulk of the War of Independence rank and file in the southwest. Collins, Dick McKee and regional commanders such as Dan Breen and Tom Barry oversaw tactics and general strategy. There were also regional organisers, such as Ernie O&#x27;Malley and Liam Mellows, who reported directly to Collins at St Ita&#x27;s secret basement GHQ in central Dublin. They were supported by a vast intelligence network of men and women in all walks of life that reached deep into the British administration in Ireland.

It was at this time that Collins created a special assassination unit called The Squad expressly to kill British agents and informers. Collins was criticised for these tactics but cited the universal war-time practice of executing enemy spies who were, in his words, &quot;hunting victims for execution.&quot; Campaigning for Irish independence, even non-violently, was still targeted both by prosecutions under British law entailing the death penalty and also by extrajudicial killings such as that of Tomás Mac Curtain, nationalist mayor of Cork City.

In 1920, the British offered £10,000 (equivalent to £300,000 / €360,000 in 2010) for information leading to Collins&#x27; capture or death. He evaded capture and continued to strike against British forces, often operating from safe-houses near government buildings, such as Vaughan&#x27;s and An Stad.

In 1920, following Westminster&#x27;s prominent announcements that it had the Irish insurgents on the run, Collins and his Squad killed several people in a series of coordinated raids, including a number of British secret service agents. Members of the Royal Irish Constabulary went to Croke Park, where a G.A.A. football match was taking place between Dublin and Tipperary. The police officers opened fire on the crowd, killing twelve and wounding sixty. This event became known as Bloody Sunday. Many British operatives sought the shelter of Dublin Castle next day. About the same time, Tom Barry&#x27;s 3rd Cork Brigade took no prisoners in a bitter battle with British forces at Kilmichael. In many regions, the RIC and other crown forces became all but confined to the strongest barracks in the larger towns as rural areas came increasingly under rebel control.

These republican victories would have been impossible without widespread support from the Irish population, which included every level of society and reached deep into the British administration in Ireland. In May 1921, elections were held in the Northern part of Ireland under the 1920 Government of Ireland Act which separated the governance of six counties in Ulster from the rest of Ireland. Collins was elected to a seat in Armagh, demonstrating popular support for the republican movement.

At the time of the ceasefire in July 1921 a major operation was allegedly in planning to execute every British secret service agent in Dublin, while a major ambush involving eighty officers and men was also planned for Templeglantine, County Limerick.

==Truce==
In 1921 General Macready, commander of British forces in Ireland, reported to his government that the Empire&#x27;s only hope of holding Ireland was by martial law, including the suspension of &quot;all normal life&quot;. Westminster&#x27;s foreign policy ruled out this option: Irish-American public opinion was important to British agendas in Asia. In addition, Britain&#x27;s efforts at a military solution had already resulted in a powerful peace movement, which demanded an end to the unrest in Ireland. Prominent voices calling for negotiation included the Labour Party, &quot;The Times&quot; and other leading periodicals, members of the House of Lords, English Catholics, and famous authors such as George Bernard Shaw.

Still, it was not the British government that initiated negotiations. Individual English activists, including clergy, made private overtures which reached Arthur Griffith. Griffith expressed his welcome for dialogue. The British MP Brigadier General Cockerill sent an open letter to Prime Minister David Lloyd George that was printed in the Times, outlining how a peace conference with the Irish should be organised. Pope Benedict XV made an urgent public appeal for a negotiated end to the violence. Whether or not Lloyd George welcomed such advisors, he could no longer hold out against this tide.

In July, Lloyd George&#x27;s government offered a truce. Arrangements were made for a conference between the British government and the leaders of the yet-unrecognised Republic. There remains uncertainty as to the two sides&#x27; capability to have carried on the conflict much longer. Collins told Hamar Greenwood after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty: &quot;You had us dead beat. We could not have lasted another three weeks. When we were told of the offer of a truce we were astonished. We thought you must have gone mad&quot;. However he stated on the record that &quot;there will be no compromise and no negotiations with any British Government until Ireland is recognised as an independent republic. The same effort that would get us Dominion Home Rule will get us a republic.&quot; At no time had the Dáil or the IRA asked for a conference or a truce.

However, the Dáil as a whole was less uncompromising. It decided to proceed to a peace conference, although it was ascertained in the preliminary stages that a fully independent republic would not be on the table and that the loss of some northeastern counties was a foregone conclusion.

Many of the rebel forces on the ground first heard of the Truce when it was announced in the newspapers and this gave rise to the first fissures in nationalist unity, which had serious consequences later on. They felt they had not been included in consultations regarding its terms.

De Valera was widely acknowledged as the most skilful negotiator on the Dáil government side and he participated in the initial parlays, agreeing the basis on which talks could begin. The first meetings were held in strict secrecy soon after the Custom House battle, with Andrew Cope representing Dublin Castle&#x27;s British authorities. Later, de Valera travelled to London for the first official contact with Lloyd George. The two met one-on-one in a private meeting, the proceedings of which have never been revealed.

During this Truce period, de Valera sued for official designation as President of the Irish Republic and obtained it from the Dáil in August 1921, in place of the title which had previously been used of President of Dáil Éireann. Not long after, the Cabinet was obliged to select the delegation that would travel to the London peace conference and negotiate a treaty. In a departure from his usual role, de Valera adamantly declined to attend, insisting instead that Collins should take his place there, along with Arthur Griffith.

Collins resisted the appointment, protesting that he was &quot;a soldier, not a politician&quot; and that his exposure to the London authorities would reduce his effectiveness as a guerrilla leader should hostilities resume. (He had kept his public visibility to a minimum during the conduct of the war; up to this time the British still had very few reliable photographs of him.) The Cabinet of seven split on the issue, with de Valera casting the deciding vote. Many of Collins&#x27; associates warned him not to go, that he was being set up as a political scapegoat.

==Anglo-Irish Treaty==

The Irish delegates sent to London were designated as &quot;plenipotentiaries&quot;, meaning that they had full authority to sign an agreement on behalf of the Dáil government. The Treaty would then be subject to approval by the Dáil. The majority of the delegates, including Arthur Griffith (leader), Robert Barton and Eamonn Duggan (with Erskine Childers as Secretary General to the delegation) set up headquarters at 22 Hans Place in Knightsbridge on 11 October 1921. Collins shared quarters at 15 Cadogan Gardens with the delegation&#x27;s publicity department, secretary Diarmuid O&#x27;Hegarty, Joseph McGrath as well as substantial intelligence and bodyguard personnel including Liam Tobin, Tom Cullen, Eamon Broy, Emmet Dalton and Joseph Dolan of The Squad.

The British team were led by their Prime Minister Lloyd George, the Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill and F. E. Smith. During two months of arduous negotiations, the Irish delegates made frequent crossings between London and Dublin to confer with their Dáil colleagues, and Collins&#x27; correspondence reflects his frustration at Dáil debates and the Irish delegate&#x27;s inability to agree to clear instructions as to whether or not they should accept a treaty.

In November, with the London peace talks still in progress, Collins attended a large meeting of regional IRA commanders at Parnell Place in Dublin. In a private conference, he informed Liam Deasy, Florence O&#x27;Donoghue and Liam Lynch that there would have to be some compromise in the current negotiations in London. &quot;There was no question of our getting all the demands we were making.&quot; He was advised by Lynch not to bring this out in the full assembly. Reviewing subsequent events, Deasy later doubted the wisdom of that advice.

The negotiations ultimately resulted in the Anglo-Irish Treaty which was signed on 6 December 1921. The agreement provided for a Dominion status &quot;Irish Free State&quot;, whose relationship to the British Commonwealth would be modelled after Canada&#x27;s. This was a compromise, halfway between an independent republic and a province of the Empire. The Treaty was signed under considerable pressure from the British. The negotiators had agreed at the cabinet meeting in Dublin that they would not sign the Treaty without bringing it back for the Dáil cabinet to ratify. But once back in London on 5 December at 7:30 pm, Lloyd George told them it was immediate signature or &quot;immediate and terrible war&quot; and that he had to know by the next day. Winston Churchill recalled Collins&#x27;s reaction: &quot;Michael Collins rose as if he was going to shoot someone, preferably himself. In all my life I have never seen so much passion and suffering in restraint.&quot; The Treaty was signed at 2:20 am, 6 December 1921.

The settlement overturned the Act of Union by recognising the native Irish legislature&#x27;s independence. Under a bicameral parliament, the executive authority would remain vested in the king, represented in Ireland by a Governor General, but exercised by an Irish government elected by Dáil Éireann as a &quot;lower house&quot;. British forces would depart the Free State forthwith and be replaced by an Irish army. Along with an independent judiciary, the Treaty granted the new Free State greater independence than any Irish state, and went well beyond the Home Rule which had been sought by Charles Stewart Parnell or by his Irish Parliamentary Party successors John Redmond and John Dillon.

The Treaty acknowledged the partition of Ireland. Before Treaty negotiations had concluded, executive powers had already been passed to the government of Northern Ireland created under the Government of Ireland Act in 1920. Northern Ireland, which had a majority unionist population, could opt out of the Free State, a year after the signing of the Treaty. An Irish Boundary Commission was to be established to draw a border, &quot;in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants&#x27; and &#x27;economic and geographic conditions&quot;. Collins anticipated a redrawing of the border would result in much of the south and west of Northern Ireland becoming part of the Free State, making Northern Ireland economically non-viable, and facilitating the reunification of the 32 counties in the near future.

Collins argued that he had signed the Treaty as the alternative was a war that the Irish people did not want. &quot;I say that rejection of the Treaty is a declaration of war until you have beaten the British Empire, apart from any alternative document. Rejection of the Treaty means your national policy is war…. The Treaty was signed by me, not because they held up the alternative of immediate war. I signed it because I would not be one of those to commit the Irish people to war without the Irish people committing themselves to war.&quot; While the Treaty fell short of the republic for which he had fought, Collins concluded that the Treaty offered Ireland &quot;not the freedom that all nations desire and develop to, but the freedom to achieve it.&quot;

Nonetheless, he knew that elements of the Treaty would cause controversy in Ireland. Upon signing the treaty, F. E. Smith remarked &quot;I may have signed my political death warrant tonight&quot;. Collins replied &quot;I may have signed my actual death warrant&quot;.

===Treaty debates===
This remark encapsulated his acknowledgement that the Treaty was a compromise that would be vulnerable to charges of &quot;sell-out&quot; from purist Republicans. It did not establish the fully independent republic that Collins himself had shortly before demanded as a non-negotiable condition. The &quot;physical force republicans&quot; who made up the bulk of the army which had fought the British to a draw would be loath to accept dominion status within the British Empire or an Oath of Allegiance that mentioned the King. Also controversial was the British retention of Treaty Ports on the south coast of Ireland for the Royal Navy. These factors diminished Irish sovereignty and threatened to allow British interference in Ireland&#x27;s foreign policy. Collins and Griffith were well aware of these issues and strove tenaciously, against British resistance, to achieve language which could be accepted by all constituents. They succeeded in obtaining an oath to the Irish Free State, with a subsidiary oath of fidelity to the King, rather than to the king unilaterally.

Éamon de Valera, the President of the Dáil objected to the Treaty on the grounds that it had been signed without cabinet consent and that it secured neither the full independence of Ireland nor Irish unity. Collins and his supporters argued that de Valera had refused strenuous pleas from Collins, Griffith and others to lead the London negotiations in person. He had refused the delegates&#x27; continual requests for instruction, and in fact, had been at the centre of the original decision to enter negotiations without the possibility of an independent republic on the table.

The Treaty controversy split the entire nationalist movement. Sinn Féin, the Dáil, the IRB and the army each divided into pro- and anti-Treaty factions. The Supreme Council of the IRB had been informed in detail about every facet of the Treaty negotiations and had approved many of its provisions, and all but one voted to accept the Treaty – the single exception being Liam Lynch, later Chief-of-Staff of the anti-Treaty IRA.

The Dáil debated the Treaty bitterly for ten days until it was approved by a vote of 64 to 57. Having lost this vote, de Valera announced his intent to withdraw his participation from the Dáil and called on all deputies who had voted against the Treaty to follow him. A substantial number did so, officially splitting the government.

A large part of the Irish Republican Army opposed the Treaty and in March 1922 voted at an Army Convention to reject the authority of the Dail, Collins&#x27; GHQ and to elect their own Executive. Anti-Treaty IRA units began to seize buildings and take other guerrilla actions against the Provisional Government. On 14 April 1922, a group of 200 anti-Treaty IRA men occupied the Four Courts in Dublin under Rory O&#x27;Connor, a hero of the War of Independence. The Four Courts was the centre of the Irish courts system, originally under the British and then the Free State. Collins was charged by his Free State colleagues with putting down these insurgents, however, he resisted firing on former comrades and staved off a shooting war throughout this period.

While the country teetered on the edge of civil war, continuous meetings were carried on among the various factions from January to June 1922. In these discussions, the nationalists strove to resolve the issue without armed conflict. Collins and his close associate, Teachta Dála (TD) Harry Boland were among those who worked desperately to heal the rift.

To foster military unity, Collins and the IRB established an &quot;army re-unification committee&quot;, including delegates from pro- and anti-Treaty factions. The still-secret Irish Republican Brotherhood continued to meet, fostering dialogue between pro- and anti-Treaty IRA officers. In the IRB&#x27;s stormy debates on the subject, Collins held out the Constitution of the new Free State as a possible solution. Collins was then in the process of co-writing that document and was striving to make it a republican constitution that included provisions that would allow anti-Treaty TDs to take their seats in good conscience, without any oath concerning the Crown.

==Northern Ireland==

Since June 1920, communal conflict had been raging in north-east Ulster between the Protestant unionist majority there, who wanted to remain part of the UK, and the Catholic Irish nationalist minority, who backed Irish independence. Belfast saw &quot;savage and unprecedented&quot; sectarian violence. Protestant loyalists attacked the Catholic community in retaliation for IRA actions. More than 500 people were killed, more than 8,000 workers were driven out of their jobs, and more than 10,000 became refugees – mostly from the Catholic minority (see The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922)). After the death of Collins, his concern for the plight of northern Catholics was made clear by the Belfast IRA commander Seamus Woods &quot;Of all the Dublin government ministers, Collins had been most deeply concerned about the fate of northern Catholics.&quot; In May 1921, Ireland was partitioned under British law, creating Northern Ireland, and unionists formed a Northern government. In early 1922, there were clashes along the new border between the IRA on the Southern side and Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) on the Northern side, as well as a resurgence of sectarian violence in Belfast.

Collins strongly opposed partition, but he was ambiguous about his policy for undoing it. On one hand, he told the Dáil during the Treaty debates: &quot;We have stated we would not coerce the North-East … Surely we recognise that the North-East corner does exist … The Treaty has made an effort to deal with it … on lines that will lead very rapidly to goodwill, and the entry of the North-East under the Irish Parliament&quot;. The pro-Treaty side argued that the proposed Irish Boundary Commission would give large swathes of Northern Ireland to the Free State, leaving the remaining territory too small to be economically viable.

However, in private Collins told the northern divisions of the IRA, early in 1922 that, &quot;although the Treaty might have seemed an outward expression of partition, the [Irish] Government plans to make it impossible … Partition would never be recognised, even if it meant smashing the Treaty&quot;. In January 1922, six months after the ceasefire (truce), Collins helped to form an &#x27;Ulster Council&#x27; within the IRA, which included the commanders of its five northern divisions, to co-ordinate IRA activity in the North. Collins&#x27; Provisional Government also funded Northern county councils and paid the salaries of teachers in Northern Ireland who recognised the Free State.

In March, Collins met Sir James Craig, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, in London. They signed an agreement declaring peace in the North, which promised cooperation between Catholics and Protestants in policing and security, and a generous budget for restoring Catholics to homes which had been destroyed. To some northern Republicans Collins had formally recognized partition and had done so without consulting them. The day after the agreement was published, violence erupted again in the Arnon Street killings. A policeman was shot dead in Belfast and in reprisal, police broke into Catholic homes nearby and shot residents in their beds, including children (see McMahon killings). There was no response to Collins&#x27; demands for an inquiry. He and his Cabinet warned that they would deem the agreement broken unless Craig took action. In his continual correspondence with Churchill over violence in the North, Collins protested repeatedly that such breaches of the truce threatened to invalidate the Treaty entirely. The prospect was real enough that on 3 June 1922 Churchill presented to the Committee of Imperial Defence his plans &quot;to protect Ulster from invasion by the South&quot;.

In spring 1922, Collins, along with other IRB and IRA leaders, developed secret plans for a guerrilla offensive in Northern Ireland. It was to involve &quot;both&quot; pro- and anti-Treaty IRA units. Collins hoped the offensive would undermine the Northern Ireland government and unite the pro- and anti-treaty IRA in a shared goal. Collins and National Army GHQ secretly supplied weaponry and equipment for the offensive, and some British arms that had been supplied to the Provisional Government were passed on to the IRA. Because of this, most northern IRA units supported Collins and 524 individual volunteers came south to join the National Army in the Irish Civil War.

The offensive was to begin on 2 May 1922, but most of the IRA divisions had to postpone until later in the month. The 1st, 4th and 5th divisions, based in Southern territory, did not take part. This, and the staggered start to the offensive, made it easier for the Northern authorities to tackle. The Northern government launched a massive security crackdown and introduced internment, which would cripple the IRA in Northern Ireland. The offensive saw the Battle of Pettigo and Belleek in early June, which ended with British troops shelling IRA positions on the border. Collins chided pro-Treaty IRA units who became embroiled in the fighting and the Provisional Government issued an order that their policy was &quot;peaceful obstruction … and no troops from the twenty- six counties either official or attached to the executive [anti-Treaty] should be permitted to invade the six county area&quot;.

However, in early August Collins wrote to Cosgrave: &quot;I am forced to the conclusion that we may yet have to fight the British in the north-east&quot;. At the same time he told northern IRA officers he would &quot;use the political arm against Craig so long as it is of use. If that fails, the treaty can go to hell and we will all start again&quot;.

After the death of Collins, aid from the Provisional Government to the northern IRA was cut off. Belfast Brigade (IRA) leader Roger McCorley stated: &quot;When Collins was killed the northern element [of the IRA] gave up all hope&quot;.

==Provisional government==

De Valera resigned the presidency and sought re-election but Arthur Griffith replaced him after a close vote on 9 January 1922. Griffith chose as his title President of Dáil Éireann, rather than President of the Republic as de Valera had favoured. The Dáil Éireann government did not hold legal status in British constitutional law. The provisions of the Treaty required the formation of a &quot;new&quot; government established under British law with royal assent, which would be recognised by Westminster as pertaining to the Free State dominion that had been agreed under the Treaty. Despite the abdication of a large part of the Dáil, the Provisional Government (Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann) was formed with Michael Collins as Chairman of the Cabinet (effectively Prime Minister). The Provisional Government operated concurrently with the Dáil Éireann government under Griffith. Collins retained his position as Minister for Finance in both governments. 

In British legal tradition, Collins was now a Crown-appointed prime minister of a Commonwealth dominion, installed under the Royal Prerogative. To be so installed he had to formally meet the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Viscount FitzAlan, the head of the British administration in Ireland. The republican view of the same meeting is that Collins met FitzAlan to accept the surrender of Dublin Castle, the official seat of the British government in Ireland. Having surrendered, FitzAlan still remained in place as viceroy until December 1922.

The Provisional Government&#x27;s first obligation was to create a Constitution for the Free State. This was undertaken by Collins and a team of solicitors. The outcome of their work became the Irish Constitution of 1922. He drew up a republican constitution which, without repudiating the Treaty, would include no mention of the British King. His object was that the Constitution would allow participation in the Dáil by dissenting TDs who opposed the Treaty and refused to take any oath recognising the Crown. Under the Treaty, the Free State was obliged to submit its new Constitution to Westminster for approval. Upon doing so, in June 1922, Collins and Griffith found Lloyd George determined to veto the provisions they had fashioned to prevent civil war.

The meetings with Lloyd George and Churchill were bitter and contentious. Collins, although less diplomatic than Griffith or de Valera, had no less penetrating comprehension of political issues. He complained that he was being manipulated into &quot;doing Churchill&#x27;s dirty work&quot;, in a potential civil war with his own former troops.

==Pact elections==
Negotiations to prevent civil war resulted in, among others, &quot;The Army Document&quot; published in May 1922 which was signed by an equal number of pro- and anti-Treaty IRA officers including Collins, Dan Breen, and Gearóid O&#x27;Sullivan. This manifesto declared that &quot;a closing of ranks all round is necessary&quot; to prevent &quot;the greatest catastrophe in Irish history&quot;. It called for new elections, to be followed by the re-unification of the government and army, whatever the result.

In this spirit and with the organising efforts of moderates on both sides the Collins–de Valera &quot;Pact&quot; was created. This pact agreed that new elections to the Dáil would be held with each candidate running as explicitly pro- or anti-Treaty and that, regardless of which side obtained a majority, the two factions would then join to form a coalition government of national unity.

A referendum on the Treaty was also planned but it never took place. The Pact elections on 16 June 1922 therefore comprise the best quantitative record of the Irish public&#x27;s response to the Treaty. The results were pro-Treaty 58 seats, anti-Treaty 36, Labour Party 17, Independents 6, Farmers Party 7, plus 4 Unionists from Trinity College Dublin.

==Assassination of Sir Henry Wilson==

Six days after the Pact elections, Sir Henry Wilson was assassinated by Reginald Dunne and Joseph O&#x27;Sullivan—two London-based IRA volunteers, who had served in World War I, in which O&#x27;Sullivan had lost a leg—outside Wilson&#x27;s home at 36 Eaton Place at approximately 2:20 pm. He was in full uniform as he was returning from unveiling the Great Eastern Railway War Memorial at Liverpool Street station at 1:00 pm. Shot while he crossed the pavement from a parked taxi to the door of his house, Wilson suffered six wounds - two of them fatal - to the chest. Two police officers and a chauffeur were also shot as the two assassins sought to avoid capture. They were then surrounded by a crowd and arrested by other policemen after a struggle. Dunne and O&#x27;Sullivan were convicted of murder and hanged on 10 August 1922.

A British Army field marshal, Wilson had recently resigned his commission and been elected an MP for a constituency in Northern Ireland. He had a long history as one of the chief British leaders opposing Collins in the Irish conflict. At that time Wilson had served as military advisor to the Northern Ireland government led by James Craig, in which role he was seen to be responsible for the B-Specials and for other sources of loyalist violence in the north. The debate concerning Collins&#x27; involvement continued in the 1950s when a number of statements and rebuttals on the subject were published in periodicals. These were reprinted with additions in Rex Taylor&#x27;s 1961 book, &quot;Assassination: the death of Sir Henry Wilson and the tragedy of Ireland&quot;. Participants in that discussion were Joe Dolan, Florence O&#x27;Donoghue, Denis P. Kelleher, Patrick O&#x27;Sullivan, and others.

==Civil War==
The death of Sir Henry Wilson caused a furor in London. Lloyd George, the Prime Minister, sent a letter to Collins saying that the &#x27;ambiguous position&#x27; of the Provisional Government with regard to the IRA in the Four Courts could no longer be tolerated. The British cabinet met the day after the assassination and agreed that Collins&#x27; reply had not given a &#x27;definite enough commitment&#x27; to disperse the Four Courts occupation. They ordered Nevil Macready, commander of the British garrison still in Dublin, to attack the Four Courts, whose republican garrison they blamed for the shooting of Wilson. The plan was put on hold at the last minute when Macready advised the government, on 26 June, to give Collins&#x27; Provisional Government one more chance to act against the Four Courts.

Collins himself was in Cork at the time of the crisis. President Arthur Griffith and military officer Emmet Dalton met with British officials to discuss &#x27;the continued occupation of the Four Courts by the Irregulars under Rory O&#x27;Connor&#x27;. There is little documentation of the decision taken by the Provisional Government, headed by Collins, to attack the Four Courts; Historian Michael Hopkinson writes, &#x27;the scarcity of evidence is explained by the acute sensitivity of the subject, both at the time and since&#x27;. When Collins arrived back in Dublin, his forces began to act against the anti-Treatyites. On 27 June they arrested anti-Treaty IRA officer Leo Henderson as he was enforcing the Belfast Boycott by seizing cars. In retaliation the anti-Treaty IRA men abducted J. J. &quot;Ginger&quot; O&#x27;Connell, a Free State general, and held him in the Four Courts.

These two developments led to the Provisional Government&#x27;s 27 June 1922 order serving notice on the Four Courts garrison to surrender the building, their arms and release O&#x27;Connell, that night or face military action &quot;at once&quot;. According to historian Charles Townsend, &#x27;Collins must have consented to this though the actual decision seems to have been taken by Griffith&#x27;. Peter Hart similarly writes, &#x27;it was Griffith rather than Collins who took the lead in this decision&#x27;. However a contemporary observer of events, cabinet member Ernest Blythe, contradicts the historians recalling that, &#x27;the decision to attack the Four Courts was almost automatic once Collins had agreed to it&#x27;.

Collins&#x27; position in this conflict was extraordinary indeed. A majority of the IRA he had helped lead in the War of Independence, were now ranged against the Provisional Government, which he led. In addition, the force which by the will of the electorate he was obliged to lead had been re-organised since the Truce. Formed from a nucleus of pro-Treaty IRA men, it had evolved into a more formal, structured, uniformed National Army that was armed and funded by Britain. Many of the new members were World War I veterans and others who had not fought on the nationalist side before. Collins&#x27; profoundly mixed feelings about this situation are recorded in his private and official correspondence.

Artillery was provided to Richard Mulcahy, as Minister for Defence and the Free State Army by the British for the purposes of attacking the Four Courts. Emmet Dalton, an Irishman who had served in the British Army and the IRA, who was now a leading Free State commander and close associate of Collins, was placed in charge of it. The Four Courts surrendered after three days of fighting.

Heavy fighting broke out in Dublin between the anti-Treaty IRA Dublin Brigade and the Free State troops. Much of O&#x27;Connell Street suffered heavy damage; the Gresham Hotel was burned and the Four Courts reduced to a ruin. Still, under Collins&#x27; direction, the Free State rapidly took control of the capital. By July 1922 anti-Treaty forces held much of the southern province of Munster and several other areas of the country. At the height of their success, they administered local government and policing in large regions. Collins, Richard Mulcahy, and Eoin O&#x27;Duffy decided on a series of seaborne landings into republican-held areas, which re-took Munster and the west in July–August.

That July, Collins became Commander-in-Chief of the National Army while also retaining his civilian roles as Minister of Finance and Chairman of the Provisional Government. However, according to Charles Townshend, he became &#x27;a kind of generalissimo, combining military and political supremacy. Griffith had no desire or capacity to dispute the day-to-day conduct of government with him and while Mulcahy had great administrative capacity, he deferred to Collins as a strategist and thinker&#x27;. He also prorogued the meeting of the Dail until the end of hostilities, a move that historians such as John M. Regan have seen as an unconstitutional concentration of power in Collins himself and his military colleagues. On 12 July, the pro-treaty army formed a &#x27;War Council of Three&#x27; led by Collins with Richard Mulcahy and Eoin O&#x27;Duffy. At the same time martial law was introduced but not proclaimed until January 1923. At this time Collins was President of the IRB Supreme Council which claimed to be the legitimate government of the Irish Republic, commander-in-chief of the pro-treaty army, while retaining control of the Provisional Government which remained unaccountable to any government in September. On the pro-treaty side, Collins controlled civil, military, and the extra constitutional powers of the IRB. The IRB Executive, which acted as the IRB government when the supreme council was not sitting, closely resembled the &#x27;War Council of Three&#x27; with Collins and O&#x27;Duffy sitting on both. The third member of the IRB Executive was Sean O&#x27;Muithile, who Collins appointed as the commissioner of the new police force shortly before Collins was killed in action. The appointment was later rescinded. 

===Civil War peace moves===
Roughly two weeks after Cork city had been taken by Provisional Government forces, Collins travelled there to attempt to seize large sums of money that the anti-Treaty Republicans had lodged in various banks, under the account of the Land Bank.

There is also considerable evidence that Collins&#x27; journey to Cork in August 1922 was made in order to meet republican leaders with a view to ending the war.

Collins also conducted a series of meetings, regarding the possibility of peace talks in Cork on 21–22 August 1922. In Cork city, Collins met with neutral IRA members Seán O&#x27;Hegarty and Florence O&#x27;Donoghue with a view to contacting Anti-Treaty IRA leaders Tom Barry and Tom Hales to propose a truce. The anti-Treaty side had called a major convocation of officers to Béal na Bláth, a remote crossroads, with ending the war on the agenda.

De Valera was present there. However, Michel Hopkinson writes that &#x27;there is no evidence that there was any prospect of a meeting between de Valera and Collins. The People&#x27;s Rights Association, a local initiative in Cork City, had been mediating a discussion of terms between the Provisional Government and the anti-Treaty side for some weeks.

Collins&#x27; personal diary outlined his proposals for peace. Republicans must &quot;accept the People&#x27;s Verdict&quot; on the Treaty, but could then &quot;go home without their arms. We don&#x27;t ask for any surrender of their principles&quot;. He argued that the Provisional Government was upholding &quot;the people&#x27;s rights&quot; and would continue to do so. &quot;We want to avoid any possible unnecessary destruction and loss of life. We do not want to mitigate their weakness by resolute action beyond what is required&quot;. But if Republicans did not accept his terms, &quot;further blood is on their shoulders&quot;.

==Assassination==
In August 1922, it seemed as though the Civil War was winding down. The Free State had regained control of most of the country, and Collins was making frequent trips to inspect areas recently recovered from anti-Treaty forces.

His plan to travel to his native Cork on 20 August was considered particularly dangerous, and he was strenuously advised against it by several trusted associates. County Cork was an IRA stronghold as much of it was still held by anti-Treaty forces. Yet he was determined to make the trip without delay. He had fended off a number of attempts on his life in the preceding weeks and had acknowledged more than once, in private conversation, that the Civil War might end his life at any moment. On several occasions, Collins assured his advisors &quot;they won&#x27;t shoot me in my own county,&quot; or words to that effect.

On 22 August 1922, Collins set out from Cork City on a circuitous tour of West Cork. He passed first through Macroom and then took the Bandon road via Crookstown. This led through Béal na Bláth, an isolated crossroads. There they stopped at a local pub named &#x27;Long&#x27;s Pub&#x27;, now known as The Diamond Bar, to ask a question of a man standing at the crossroad. The man turned out to be an anti-Treaty sentry. He and an associate recognised Collins in the back of the open-top car.

As a result, an ambush was laid by an anti-Treaty column at that point, on the chance that the convoy might come through again on their return journey. Between 7:30 and 8:00 pm, Collins&#x27; convoy approached Béal na Bláth for the second time. By then most of the ambush party had dispersed and gone for the day, leaving just five or six men on the scene. Two were disarming a mine in the road, while three on a laneway overlooking them, provided cover. A dray cart, placed across the road, remained at the far end of the ambush site.

The &#x27;Irregulars&#x27; in the laneway opened fire with rifles on the convoy. Emmet Dalton, the Free State commander for the county, ordered the driver of the touring car to &#x27;drive like hell&#x27;, but Collins said &#x27;no, stop and we&#x27;ll fight &#x27;em&#x27;. He then jumped from the vehicle along with the others. At first, the group took cover behind a low grass bank bordering the road, but Collins then jumped up and ran back along the road to begin firing with his Lee Enfield rifle from behind the armoured car. The Vickers machine gun in that car had also been firing at the attackers but then stopped because a badly loaded ammunition belt caused it to jam.

Apparently, to get a better view of the laneway up which he had seen the enemy running, Collins left the protection of the armoured car and moved even farther back around a bend in the road out of sight of his comrades. Now standing in the open, he fired a couple of shots and as he was once more working the bolt of his rifle he was struck in the head by a bullet believed to have been fired by one of the ambushing party – Denis &quot;Sonny&quot; O&#x27;Neill, a former British Army sniper.

Collins was the only fatality sustained in the ambush, although another member of his party suffered a neck wound. After he was shot the fire from the ambushing party quickly fell off and they withdrew from the scene. Collins was found, face down, on the roadway. One of his men whispered an Act of Contrition into his ear, but Collins was clearly close to death if not already dead. He was lifted into the back of the touring car with his head resting against Dalton&#x27;s shoulder. The convoy cleared the dray cart obstruction and resumed its journey to Cork.

The lengthy time the convoy took to cover the back to Cork City was because many of the roads were blocked and the convoy had to travel across muddy fields and through farms to circumnavigate the obstacles, all in darkness. At times, when the vehicles became bogged down, members of the convoy had to carry Collins&#x27; body on their shoulders. The touring car eventually had to be abandoned because of mechanical trouble.

There was no autopsy. Collins&#x27; field diary was taken by Dalton who had been with him during his tour of the south. The body was first presented at Shanakiel Hospital in Cork, a small military establishment, and then shipped around the coast to Dublin where it was laid out in St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital Dublin. From there it was removed to the City Hall beside Dublin Castle where it was laid in state.

===Conspiracy and collusion===
Numerous questions remain about the events surrounding the death of Collins because the only witnesses to his death were the members of the Free State Army convoy and the anti-Treaty ambushers. As no two stories match and participant statements from both sides are contradictory and inconsistent, unanswered questions linger about what happened that day.

The man generally believed to have fired the fatal shot at Béal na Bláth, Denis &quot;Sonny&quot; O&#x27;Neill, was a former officer from the Royal Irish Constabulary who served as a sniper in the British Army during the First World War. O&#x27;Neill had joined the IRA in 1918 and had met Collins on more than one occasion. However, when the Irish Civil War started in June 1922, O&#x27;Neill joined the Anti-Treaty IRA.

O&#x27;Neill remains a mysterious figure because of the contradictions in his biography: such as serving in the British Army but then joining the IRA. He provided them with information concerning the Igoe Gang that worked for the British Army Intelligence Centre. In the 1940s, twenty years after Collins&#x27; death, the Irish State granted O&#x27;Neill a captain&#x27;s military pension.

==Aftermath==
Collins lay in state for three days. Tens of thousands of mourners filed past his coffin to pay their respects, including many British soldiers departing Ireland who had fought against him. His funeral mass took place at Dublin&#x27;s St Mary&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral where a number of foreign and Irish dignitaries were in attendance. Some 500,000 people attended his funeral, almost one-fifth of the country&#x27;s population at that time.

No official inquiry was ever undertaken into Collins&#x27; death and consequently, there is no official version of what happened, nor are there any authoritative, detailed contemporary records.

De Valera is alleged to have declared in 1966, &quot;It is my considered opinion that in the fullness of time history will record the greatness of Michael Collins; and it will be recorded at my expense.&quot; However, there is no evidence he ever made this remark.

==Personal life==
Collins&#x27; elderly father, who was 75 when his youngest child was born, inspired his fondness and respect for older people. His mother, who had spent her youth caring for her own invalid mother and raising her own brothers and sisters, was a powerful influence. The entire management of the Collins farm fell to her, as her husband succumbed to old age and died. In a society which honoured hospitality as a prime virtue, Mrs Collins was eulogised as &quot;a hostess in ten thousand&quot;. Her five daughters avowedly doted on their youngest brother. He enjoyed rough-housing and outdoor sports. Having won a local wrestling championship while he was still a boy, he is said to have made a pastime of challenging larger, older opponents, with frequent success. A very fit, active man throughout life, in the most stressful times he continued to enjoy wrestling as a form of relaxation and valued friendships which afforded opportunities to share athletic pursuits. He could be abrasive, demanding, and inconsiderate of those around him, but frequently made up for it with gestures such as confectionery and other small gifts.

Unlike some of his political opponents, he had many close personal friendships within the movement. It has been justly said that while some were devoted to &quot;the idea of Ireland&quot;, Collins was a people person whose patriotism was rooted in affection and respect for the people of Ireland around him. Among his famous last words is the final entry in his pocket diary, written on the journey that ended his life, &quot;The people are splendid.&quot;

In 1921–22, he became engaged to Kitty Kiernan. Under Kiernan&#x27;s influence, he would resume Catholic religious practice (though retaining secularism as a political position), despite his previous hostility to the Irish Catholic hierarchy. He made a general confession before his departure for London to negotiate the Anglo-Irish Treaty. While in London, his practice of lighting votive candles for Kiernan developed a habit of attending mass daily, usually at the Brompton Oratory. In letters between the two, he credits Kiernan as having given him a newfound appreciation of Confession and Communion. Collins attended Mass regularly throughout the ensuing civil war.

Collins was a complex man whose character abounded in contradictions. He seems never to have pursued personal profit. This characteristic was exemplified by a letter he wrote on 4 August 1922 to his canvassing agent; offering to pay half the bill for a hired election car because some of the journeys had been for personal trips. While clearly fond of command and keen to take charge, he had an equal appetite for input and advice from people at every level of the organisation, prompting the comment that &quot;he took advice from his chauffeur.&quot; Although acknowledged by friends and foes as &quot;head centre&quot; of the movement, he continually chose a title just short of actual head of state; becoming Chairman of the Provisional Government only after the abdication of half the Dáil forced him to do so. While his official and personal correspondence records his solicitous care for the wants of insurgents in need, during the war he showed no hesitation in ordering the death of opponents who threatened nationalist lives.

While mastermind of a clandestine military, he remained a public figure. When official head of the Free State government, he continued to cooperate in the IRA&#x27;s secret operations. He was capable of bold, decisive actions on his own authority, which caused friction with his colleagues, such as his falling out with Cathal Brugha; but at critical junctures, he could also bow to majority decisions which were profoundly disadvantageous and dangerous to his own interests, such as his appointment to the Treaty negotiating team.

==Commemoration==

An annual commemoration ceremony takes place each year in August near the ambush site at Béal na Bláth, County Cork, organised by The Béal na mBláth Commemoration Committee. In 2009, the former President of Ireland Mary Robinson gave the oration. In 2010 the Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan Jnr became the first Fianna Fáil person to give the oration. In 2012 on the 90th anniversary of the death of Collins, the Taoiseach Enda Kenny gave the oration, the first serving head of government to do so.

There is also a remembrance ceremony at Collins&#x27; grave in Glasnevin Cemetery on the anniversary of his death every year.
Michael Collins House museum in Clonakilty, Cork is a museum dedicated to Michael Collins and the history of Irish Independence. Situated in a restored Georgian House on Emmet Square, where Collins once lived, the museum, tells the life story of Collins through guided tours, interactive displays, audiovisuals and historical artefacts.

The Central Bank of Ireland released gold and silver commemorative coins on 15 August 2012 which feature a portrait of Michael Collins designed by Thomas Ryan based on a photograph taken not long before his death.

==Legacy==

Collins bequeathed to posterity a considerable body of writing: essays, speeches and tracts, articles and official documents in which he outlined plans for Ireland&#x27;s economic and cultural revival, as well as a voluminous correspondence, both official and personal. Selections have been published in &quot;The Path to Freedom&quot; (Mercier, 1968) and in &quot;Michael Collins in His Own Words&quot; (Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1997). In the 1960s, Taoiseach Seán Lemass, himself a veteran of the 1916 Rising and War of Independence, credited Collins&#x27; ideas as the basis for his successes in revitalizing Ireland&#x27;s economy.

Nine years after his death, the UK Parliament passed the Statute of Westminster, which removed virtually all of London&#x27;s remaining authority over the Free State and the other dominions. This had the effect of granting the Free State internationally recognised independence, thus fulfilling Collins&#x27; vision of having &quot;the freedom to achieve freedom&quot;.

Collins and the IRA were a major source of inspiration for the leader of the Zionist insurgent Lehi group and future Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Shamir. During the 1948 Palestine War Shamir adopted &quot;Michael&quot; as his &quot;nom de guerre&quot;. Chinese leader Mao Zedong also studied Collins&#x27; practices of guerrilla warfare.

The Collins 22 Society established in 2002 is an international organisation dedicated to keeping the name and legacy of Michael Collins in living memory. The patron of the society is Ireland&#x27;s former Minister for Justice and TD Nora Owen, grand-niece of Michael Collins.

==Quotations==
&quot;That volley which we have just heard is the only speech which it is proper to make over the grave of a dead Fenian.&quot; 
Said by Collins at the funeral of Thomas Ashe in Glasnevin Cemetery on 30 September 1917.

&quot;Think—what I have got for Ireland? Something which she has wanted these past 700 years. Will anyone be satisfied at the bargain? Will anyone? I tell you this—early this morning I signed my death warrant&quot;.
Written in a letter dated 6 December 1921 after the signing of the treaty that established the Irish Free State.

When an elder Sinn Fein veteran asked Collins: &quot;Where were you in 1904 when I and others were founding the Sinn Fein movement?&quot; He responded bluntly. &quot;I was playing with marbles, damn you!&quot;

&quot;We&#x27;ve been waiting 700 years, you can have the seven minutes&quot;.
Said by Collins on 16 January 1922 when arriving at Dublin Castle for the handover by British forces after being told that he was seven minutes late.

&quot;My own fellow countrymen won&#x27;t kill me&quot;.
Said by Collins on 20 August 1922 before leaving for Cork where he was ambushed and killed.

==In popular culture==

===Film and television===

The 1936 film &quot;Beloved Enemy&quot; is a fictionalised account of Collins&#x27; life. Unlike the real Michael Collins, the fictionalised &quot;Dennis Riordan&quot; (played by Brian Aherne) is shot but recovers. &quot;Hang Up Your Brightest Colours&quot;, a British documentary by Kenneth Griffith, was made for ITV in 1973, but refused transmission. It was eventually screened by the BBC in Wales in 1993 and across the United Kingdom the following year.

In 1969, Dominic Behan wrote an episode of the UK television series &quot;Play for Today&quot; entitled &quot;Michael Collins&quot;. The play dealt with Collins&#x27; attempt to take the gun out of Irish politics and took the perspective of the republican argument. At the time of writing the script, the Troubles had just begun in Northern Ireland and the BBC was reluctant to broadcast the production. An appeal by the author to David Attenborough (Director of Programming for the BBC at that time) resulted in the play eventually being broadcast; Attenborough took the view that the imperatives of free speech could not be compromised in the cause of political expediency.

An Irish documentary made by Colm Connolly for RTÉ Television in 1989 called &quot;The Shadow of Béal na Bláth&quot; covered Collins&#x27; death. A made-for-TV film, &quot;The Treaty&quot;, was produced in 1991 and starred Brendan Gleeson as Collins and Ian Bannen as David Lloyd George. In 2007, RTÉ produced a documentary entitled &quot;Get Collins&quot;, about the intelligence war which took place in Dublin.

Collins was the subject of director Neil Jordan&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Michael Collins&quot;, with Liam Neeson in the title role. Collins&#x27; great-grandnephew, Aengus O&#x27;Malley, played a student in a scene filmed in Marsh&#x27;s Library.

In 2005 Cork Opera House commissioned a musical drama about Collins. &quot;Michael Collins- A Musical Drama&quot; by Bryan Flynn had a successful run in 2009 at Cork opera house and later in the Olympia Theatre in Dublin.

&quot;Infamous Assassinations&quot;, a 2007 British documentary television series, devoted its eighth episode to the death of Collins.

The 2016 miniseries, &quot;Rebellion&quot;, focused on the 1916 Easter Rising. Collins appeared as a background character, taking part in the uprising, played by Sebastian Thommen.

Collins was portrayed by Gavin Drea in the 2019 sequel to &quot;Rebellion&quot;, &quot;Resistance&quot;.

===Songs===

Irish-American folk rock band Black 47 recorded a song entitled &quot;The Big Fellah&quot; which was the first track on their 1994 album &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;. It details Collins&#x27; career, from the Easter Rising to his death at Béal na Bláth. Irish folk band the Wolfe Tones recorded a song titled &quot;Michael Collins&quot; on &quot;A Sense of Freedom&quot; (1983) about Collins&#x27; life and death, although it begins when he was about 16 and took a job in London. Celtic metal band Cruachan recorded a song also titled &quot;Michael Collins&quot; on their 2004 album &quot;Pagan&quot; which dealt with his role in the Civil War, the treaty and his eventual death. Also a song by Johnny McEvoy, simply named &quot;Michael&quot;, depicts Collins&#x27; death and the sadness surrounding his funeral.

The poem &quot;The laughing boy&quot; by Brendan Behan lamenting the death of Collins was translated into Greek in 1961 by Vasilis Rotas. In October of the same year, Mikis Theodorakis composed the song &quot;Tο γελαστό παιδί&quot; (&quot;The laughing boy&quot;) using Rotas&#x27; translation. The song was recorded by Maria Farantouri in 1966 on the album &quot;Ένας όμηρος&quot; (&quot;A hostage&quot;) and became an instant success. It was the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Z&quot; (1969). &quot;The laughing boy&quot; became the song of protest against the dictatorship in Greece (1967–1974) and remains to date one of the most popular songs in Greek popular culture.

===Plays===
Journalist Eamonn O&#x27;Neill wrote the play &quot;God Save Ireland Cried the Hero&quot; about Collins&#x27; last night alive. Set in his hotel room, the one-man production started Liam Brennan in the role of Collins and was produced by the Wiseguise Company. It was performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1996.

Mary Kenny wrote a play &quot;Allegiance&quot;, about a meeting between Winston Churchill and Collins. The play premiered in 2006 for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with Mel Smith playing Churchill and Michael Fassbender, a great-great-grandnephew of Collins, playing him.

<text>Shangdi (), also called simply Di (), is the name of the Chinese Highest Deity or &quot;Lord Above&quot; in the theology of the classical texts, especially deriving from Shang theology and finding an equivalent in the later &quot;Tiān&quot; (&quot;Heaven&quot; or &quot;Great Whole&quot;) of Zhou theology.

Although the use of &quot;Tian&quot; to refer to the absolute God of the universe is predominant in Chinese religion today, &quot;Shangdi&quot; continues to be used in a variety of traditions, including certain philosophical schools, certain strains of Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, some Chinese salvationist religions (notably Yiguandao) and Chinese Protestant Christianity. In addition, it is commonly used by contemporary Chinese (both mainland and overseas) and by religious and secular groups in East Asia, as a name of a singular universal deity and as a non-religious translation for God in Abrahamic religions.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Shang Di&quot; is the pinyin romanization of two Chinese characters. The first , &quot;Shàng&quot; means &quot;high&quot;, &quot;highest&quot;, &quot;first&quot;, &quot;primordial&quot;; the second , &quot;Dì&quot; is typically considered as shorthand for &quot;huangdi&quot; () in modern Chinese, the title of the emperors of China first employed by Qin Shi Huang, roughly some 2200 years ago, and is usually translated as &quot;emperor&quot;. The word itself is derived from Three &quot;Huang&quot; and Five &quot;Di&quot;, including Yellow Emperor (), the mythological originator of the Chinese civilization and the ancestor of the Chinese race. However, refers to the High God of Shang, thus means &quot;deity&quot; (manifested god), . Thus, the name &quot;Shangdi&quot; should be translated as &quot;Highest Deity&quot;, but also has the implied meaning of &quot;Primordial Deity&quot; or &quot;First Deity&quot; in Classical Chinese. The deity preceded the title and the emperors of China were named after him in their role as &quot;Tianzi&quot;, the sons of Heaven. In the classical texts the highest conception of the heavens is frequently identified with Shang Di, who is described somewhat anthropomorphically. He is also associated with the pole star. The conceptions of the Supreme Ruler (Shang Di) and of the Sublime Heavens () afterward coalesce or absorb each other.

=== Shang dynasty usage ===

The Shang pronunciation of &quot;Di&quot; is reconstructed as &quot;*têks&quot;. The Shang dynasty designed 23 versions of Di, all based on a common pattern and shape. The word finds itself in many inscriptional contexts, including use in collocation with natural spirits or addressing ancestral deities. There was a type of offerings named &quot;Di-sacrifice&quot;, designed for hosting Di&#x27;s representatives.

The earliest references to Shangdi are found in oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang dynasty in the 2nd millennium BC, although the later work &quot;Classic of History&quot; claims yearly sacrifices were made to him by Emperor Shun, even before the Xia dynasty.

Shangdi was regarded as the ultimate spiritual power by the ruling elite of the Huaxia during the Shang dynasty: he was believed to control victory in battle, success or failure of harvests, weather conditions such as the floods of the Yellow River, and the fate of the capital city and kingdom. Shangdi seems to have ruled a hierarchy of other gods controlling nature, as well as the spirits of the deceased. These ideas were later mirrored or carried on by the Taoist Jade Emperor and his celestial bureaucracy, and Shangdi was later syncretized with the Jade Emperor.

Shangdi was probably more transcendent than immanent, only working through lesser gods. Shangdi was considered too distant to be worshiped directly by ordinary mortals. Instead, the Shang kings proclaimed that Shangdi had made himself accessible through the souls of their royal ancestors, both in the legendary past and in recent generations as the departed Shang kings joined him in the afterlife. The kings could thus successfully entreat Shangdi directly. Many of the oracle bone inscriptions record these petitions, usually praying for rain but also seeking approval from Shangdi for state action.

Shangdi was seen as somewhat human or at least anthropomorphic and the &quot;greatest ancestor&quot; by some worshippers during this time.

=== Zhou dynasty ===

In the later Shang and Zhou dynasties, Shangdi was conflated with Heaven (, &quot;Tiān&quot;). The Duke of Zhou justified his clan&#x27;s usurpation through the concept of the Mandate of Heaven, which proposed that the protection of Shangdi was not connected to their clan membership but by their just governance. Shangdi was not just a tribal but instead an unambiguously good moral force, exercising its power according to exacting standards. Shangdi&#x27;s favor could thus be lost and even &quot;inherited&quot; by a new dynasty, provided they upheld the proper rituals.

Modern researches have paid attention to the adoption of Shang religious practices by the Zhou dynasty, and particularly, the continued worship of Shangdi through altered forms. Modern explanations are based on the parallel between Shang and Zhou adoptions. Historically, the regency of the Duke of Zhou sought to re-stabilize the Zhou dynasty. The Zhou court modeled their adoption after the Shang, whose imports of local cults as well as official worship of tribal deities played an important role in maintaining kingly sovereignty of the monarchs over subjugated polities. According to Ruth H. Chang, continuation of Shang religion also provided opportunities to further share changing religious activities the newly conquered Shang people. The Zhou dynasty aimed to make an impression that the term &quot;Di&quot; was native to them. These actions were perceived by Chang as a Zhou attempt at a similar cult adoption for the purpose of uniting Shang and Zhou under one political entity.

There were other reasons behind the Duke of Zhou&#x27;s attempt in merging Di with the concept of Tian. Evidence from oracle bone inscriptions show that the Shang believed in Shangdi&#x27;s blessings for the king, which some scholars interpreted as a belief in the ruler&#x27;s granted authority by the gods. This belief was resonant with the theory of Tian, in that the monarch received divine authority to rule. Obedience of the Shang people was likely to be ensured by implementing a Zhou concept in which the Shang found similarities with their native beliefs.

The connection of many rituals with the Shang clan meant that Shang nobles continued to rule several locations (despite their rebellions) and to serve as court advisors and priests. The Duke of Zhou even created an entire ceremonial city along strict cosmological principles to house the Shang aristocracy and the nine tripods representing Huaxia sovereignty; the Shang were then charged with maintaining the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot;. Likewise, the Shang&#x27;s lesser houses, the &quot;shi&quot; knightly class, developed directly into the learned Confucian gentry and scholars who advised the Zhou rulers on courtly etiquette and ceremony. The Confucian classics carried on and ordered the earlier traditions, including the worship of Shangdi. All of them include references:

The Four Books mention Shangdi as well but, as it is a later compilation, the references are much more sparse and abstract. Shangdi appears most commonly in earlier works: this pattern may reflect increasing rationalization of Shangdi over time, the shift from a known and arbitrary tribal god to a more abstract and philosophical concept, or his conflation and absorption by other deities.

As early as the Western Zhou period, Di had become fully synonymous with Tian, as the two words were used interchangeably in various bronze inscriptions. One such situation appears in bronze castings during King Li of Zhou&#x27;s reign (9th century BC), pointing out the prevalence of equating both words with each other.

===Han dynasty===
By the time of the Han dynasty, the influential Confucian scholar Zheng Xuan glossed: &quot;&quot;Shangdi&quot; is another name for Heaven&quot;. Dong Zhongshu said: &quot;Heaven is the ultimate authority, the king of gods who should be admired by the king&quot;. Usage of the word &quot;Di&quot; had significantly changed, and by the Han it had been used to refer to much more terms. In some cases, &quot;Di&quot; still denoted a high deity with a distinguished charge over celestial objects, but in others it was written in collocation with other words, incorporating the connotation of &quot;god&quot; to those concerned. &quot;Di&quot; featured in the name of the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi), the Flame Emperor (Yandi) and various other figures.

In later eras, he was commonly known by the name &quot;Heavenly Ruling Highest Deity&quot; (, &quot;Huángtiān Shàngdì&quot;) and, in this usage, he is especially conflated with the Taoist Jade Emperor.

==Identification==
===The Shang progenitor===
In Shang sources, Di is already described as the supreme ordainer of the events which occur in nature, such as wind, lightning and thunder, and in human affairs and politics. All the gods of nature are conceived as his envoys or manifestations. Shang sources also attest his cosmological Five Ministries. Di, or Tian, as later texts explain, did not receive cult for being too remote for living humans to sacrifice to directly. Instead, an intermediary such as an ancestor was necessary to convey to Di the offerings of the living.

According to some prominent scholars, including Guo Moruo, Shangdi was originally identical to Ku (or Kui) or Diku (&quot;&quot;Divus&quot; Ku&quot;), the progenitor (first ancestor) of the Zi () lineage, the founders of the Shang dynasty, attested in the &quot;Shiji&quot; and other texts. According to this interpretation, this identification had profound political implications, because it meant that the earthly Shang kings were themselves by birth aspects of divinity.

Further evidence from Shang sources suggests that there wasn&#x27;t a complete identification between the two, as Di controls spirits of nature, while Kui does not; Di is frequently pictured sending down &quot;approvals&quot;, while Kui is never so pictured; and Kui received cult, while Di did not. Moreover, Kui is frequently appealed in &quot;horizontal&quot; relationship with other powers, undermining any portrait of him as the apex of the pantheon.

Interpretations of Shang oracle bones yield the possibility of Di being equated with Shang Jia, the utmost and supreme being of the &quot;Six Spirits&quot; who were predynastic Shang male ancestors. The bone graph for Shang Jia consists of a square encompassing a cross. Since the cross shape is understood to be &quot;Jia&quot;, the square is therefore &quot;Shang&quot;, indicating it to be the ancestral square that constitute Di&#x27;s central core.

===Shangdi as the celestial pole===
David Pankenier has studied the astral connections of Shangdi, drawing on a view that interest in the sky was a focal character of the religious practices of the Shang, but also of the earlier Xia and Erlitou cultures. Especially intriguing is the fact that palatial and ceremonial structures of these cultures were carefully aligned to the celestial pole and the procession of pole stars. Pankenier notes that the true celestial pole lies in a sky template which is vacant of significant stars, and that the various pole stars are those nearest to this vacant apex which is of crucial importance.

He illustrates how the Shang oracular script for Di can be projected on the north pole template of the ancient sky in such a way that its extremity points correspond with the visible star, while the intersection of the linear axes at the centre will map to the vacant celestial pole. Pankenier argues that the supreme Di was identified with the celestial pole, an idea familiar in later stages of Chinese religion, linking with the &quot;Tàiyī&quot; 太一 (&quot;Great One&quot;) fully documented as early as the 4th century BC.

The interpretation of Shangdi as the celestial pole, Taiyi and as Ku the progenitor of the Shang is not contradictory. Feng Shi argues that Ku and Di are indeed identical. The Shang probably deliberately identified their ancestor with a universal god recognized in different regions and local cultures in order to legitimize their power.

=== Multiplicity of Di ===

Inscriptions of the Shang dynasty point out the collective nature of Shangdi. The fact that the word &quot;Di&quot; was also used to address Shang ancestors show that Di was intimately related to the ancestral spirits. The Shang character for Di features a squared pattern, which was a symbol of the northern ecliptic pole. This square composes many Shang ancestral names, and it even denotes temples and altars dedicated to the foremost Shang predynastic ancestors. J. C. Didier pointed out that the central square of the word &quot;Di&quot; housed all main-lineage Shang ancestral spirits. These spirits represented Di&#x27;s core of cosmic divinity and carry his will to bless the human world. &quot;Di&quot; also emcompasses non-ancestral deities that could be unfavorable towards living beings, a result of adopting foreign cults. These gods represent Di&#x27;s authority to exercise control over disastrous events, contrary to &quot;friendly&quot; Shang ancestral square. Spirits were considered by the Shang to be consular spirits of Di, and often were given direct offerings as representations of the supreme deity.

Many inscriptions found on Shang bones and bronze indicate that Di&#x27;s multiplicity could be further understood by interpreting the &quot;Shang&quot; in &quot;Shangdi&quot;. Scholars argue that the &quot;Shang&quot; component illustrated the inequivalence between &quot;Di&quot; and &quot;Shangdi&quot;. Shangdi, according to them, was only a part of Di in the mind of the Shang people, and that there was presence of Shangdi&#x27;s counterpart. Interpreting versions of the character &quot;Di&quot; in Shang texts, Didier found out that versions with two horizontal lines above the graph denoted &quot;Shangdi&quot;, while those possessing three lines would connote a broader meaning of &quot;Shangxiadi&quot; (). This connotation appearing in Shang inscriptions reveal the multiplicity in which the deity was divided into superior (&quot;shang&quot;) and lesser ranks (&quot;xia&quot;). They argued that the adopted spirits which constitute Di&#x27;s unfavorable actions to them living realm would, possibly, be housed in the lesser rank, or &quot;Xiadi&quot; (), while the &quot;friendly&quot; ancestral spirits would compose the &quot;Shangdi&quot; as a counterpart.

===Contemporary Confucianism===
Contemporary Confucian theologians have emphasised differences between the Confucian idea of Shangdi, conceived as both transcendent and immanent, and act only as a governor of the world, and the Christian idea of God, which they conceived contrary to those of Christian as a deity that is completely otherworldly (transcendent) and is merely a creator of the world.

== Worship ==

=== Rituals ===
As mentioned above, sacrifices offered to Shangdi by the king are claimed by traditional Chinese histories to predate the Xia dynasty. The surviving archaeological record shows that by the Shang, the shoulder blades of sacrificed oxen were used to send questions or communication through fire and smoke to the divine realm, a practice known as scapulimancy. The heat would cause the bones to crack and royal diviners would interpret the marks as Shangdi&#x27;s response to the king. Inscriptions used for divination were buried into special orderly pits, while those that were for practice or records were buried in common middens after use.

During the Shang, it is observed that Di did not receive direct cult. Instead, his consular spirits would be manifested into the human world to be offered sacrifices. The Shang often identified these spirits as Di, and sometimes perform a &quot;Di-sacrifice&quot; to them, illustrating intimate connections of the recipients with the being.

Under Shangdi or his later names, the deity received sacrifices from the ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty annually at a great Temple of Heaven in the imperial capital. Following the principles of Chinese geomancy, this would always be located in the southern quarter of the city. During the ritual, a completely healthy bull would be slaughtered and presented as an animal sacrifice to Shangdi. The &quot;Book of Rites&quot; states the sacrifice should occur on the &quot;longest day&quot; on a round-mound altar. The altar would have three tiers: the highest for Shangdi and the Son of Heaven; the second-highest for the sun and moon; and the lowest for the natural gods such as the stars, clouds, rain, wind, and thunder.

It is important to note that Shangdi is never represented with either images or idols. Instead, in the center building of the Temple of Heaven, in a structure called the &quot;Imperial Vault of Heaven&quot;, a &quot;spirit tablet&quot; (, shénwèi) inscribed with the name of Shangdi is stored on the throne, &quot;Huangtian Shangdi&quot; (). During an annual sacrifice, the emperor would carry these tablets to the north part of the Temple of Heaven, a place called the &quot;Prayer Hall For Good Harvests&quot;, and place them on that throne.

===Conflation with singular universal God===
It was during Ming and Qing dynasty, when Roman Catholicism was introduced by Jesuit Priest Matteo Ricci, that the idea of &quot;Shangdi&quot; started to be applied to the Christian conception of God.

While initially he utilized the term &quot;Tianzhu&quot; (), lit. &quot;The Lord of Heaven&quot;, Ricci gradually changed the translation into &quot;Shangdi&quot; instead. His usage of Shangdi was contested by Confucians, as they believed that the concept of &quot;Tian&quot; and &quot;Shangdi&quot; is different from that of Christianity&#x27;s God: Zhōng Shǐ-shēng, through his books, stated that Shangdi only governs, while Christianity&#x27;s God is a creator, and thus they differ. Ricci&#x27;s translation also invited the displeasure of Dominicans and that of the Roman Curia: on March 19, 1715, Pope Clement XI released the Edict &quot;Ex Illa Die&quot;, stating that Catholics must use &quot;Tianzhu&quot; instead of &quot;Shangdi&quot; for Christianity&#x27;s God.

When Protestantism entered China in the middle of the 19th century, the Protestant missionaries also encountered a similar issue: some preferred the term &quot;Shangdi&quot;, while some preferred the term &quot;Shen&quot; (&quot;god&quot;). A conference held in 1877 in Shanghai, discussing the translation-issue, also believed that &quot;Shangdi&quot; of Confucianism and the Christian concept of God are different in nature.

However, by the 20th century, most British missionaries, some Catholics, Chinese Orthodox Christians, and Evangelicals preferred &#x27;Shangdi&#x27; as a connection with Chinese native monotheism, with some furthering the argument by linking it with the unknown god as described in Biblical passage of . Catholics preferred to avoid it, due to compromises with the local authority in order to do their missions, as well as fear such translation may associate the Christian God to Chinese polytheism.

Nowadays, through the secular Chinese-language media, the Chinese word of &quot;Shangdi&quot; and &quot;Tian&quot; are frequently used to as a translation for the singular universal deity with minimal religious attachment to the Christian idea of God, while Confucians and intellectuals in contemporary mainland China and Taiwan attempt to realign the term to its original meaning. Catholics officially use the term &quot;Tianzhu&quot;, while Evangelicals typically use &quot;Shangdi&quot; and/or &quot;Shen&quot; (, &quot;god&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;).

<doc id="97517" wikidata="Q1135789" url="?curid=97517" title="Unintended consequences">
<text>In the social sciences, unintended consequences (sometimes unanticipated consequences or unforeseen consequences, more colloquially called knock-on effects) are outcomes of a purposeful action that are not intended or foreseen. The term was popularized in the 20th century by American sociologist Robert K. Merton.

Unintended consequences can be grouped into three types:
* &quot;Unexpected benefit&quot;: A positive unexpected benefit (also referred to as luck, serendipity, or a ).
* &quot;Unexpected drawback&quot;: An unexpected detriment occurring in addition to the desired effect of the policy (e.g., while irrigation schemes provide people with water for agriculture, they can increase waterborne diseases that have devastating health effects, such as schistosomiasis).
* &quot;Perverse result&quot;: A perverse effect contrary to what was originally intended (when an intended solution makes a problem worse).

==History==

===John Locke===
The idea of &quot;unintended consequences&quot; dates back at least to John Locke who discussed the unintended consequences of interest rate regulation in his letter to Sir John Somers, Member of Parliament.

===Adam Smith===
The idea was also discussed by Adam Smith, the Scottish Enlightenment, and consequentialism (judging by results).

The invisible hand theorem is an example of the unintended consequences of agents acting in their self-interest. As Andrew S. Skinner puts it:

&quot;The individual undertaker (entrepreneur), seeking the most efficient allocation of resources, contributes to overall economic efficiency; the merchant&#x27;s reaction to price signals helps to ensure that the allocation of resources accurately reflects the structure of consumer preferences; and the drive to better our condition contributes to economic growth.&quot;

===Marx and Engels===
Influenced by 19th century positivism and Charles Darwin&#x27;s evolution, for both Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx, the idea of uncertainty and chance in social dynamics (and thus unintended consequences beyond results of perfectly defined laws) was only apparent, (if not rejected) since social actions were directed and produced by deliberate human intention.

While discerning between the forces that generate changes in nature and those that generate changes in history in his discussion of Ludwig Feuerbach, Friedrich Engels touched on the idea of (apparent) unintended consequences:

For his part, for Karl Marx what can be understood as unintended consequences are actually consequences that should be expected but are obtained unconsciously. These consequences (that no one consciously sought) would be (in the same way as it is for Engels) product of conflicts that confront actions from countless individuals. The deviation between the original intended goal and the product derived from conflicts would be a marxist equivalent to «unintended consequences.»

This social conflicts would happen as a result of a competitive society, and also lead society to sabotage itself and prevent historical progress. Thus, historical progress (in Marxist terms) should eliminate these conflicts and make unintended consequences predictable.

===Austrian School===
Unintended consequences are a common topic of study and commentary for the Austrian school of economics given its emphasis on methodological individualism. This is to such an extent that unexpected consequences can be considered as a distinctive part of Austrian tenets.

====Carl Menger====
In &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;, Austrian school founder Carl Menger (1840 - 1921) noted that the relationships that occur in the economy are so intricate that a change in the condition of a single good can have ramifications beyond that good. Menger wrote:

====Friedrich Hayek and Catallactics====
Economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek (1899 – 1992) is another key figure in the Austrian School of Economics who is notable for his comments on unintended consequences.

In &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; (1945) Hayek argues that a centrally planned economy cannot reach the level of efficiency of the free market economy because the necessary (and pertinent) information for decision-making is not concentrated but dispersed among a vast number of agents. Then, for Hayek, the price system in the free market allows the members of a society to anonymously coordinate for the most efficient use of resources, for example, in a situation of scarcity of a raw material, the price increase would coordinate the actions of an uncountable amount of individuals &quot;in the right direction&quot;.

The development of this system of interactions would allow the progress of society, and individuals would carry it out without knowing all its implications, given the dispersion (or lack of concentration) of information.

The implication of this is that the social order (which derives from social progress, which in turn derives from the economy), would be result of a spontaneous cooperation and also an unintended consequence, being born from a process of which no individual or group had all the information available or could know all possible outcomes.

In the Austrian school, this process of social adjustment that generates a social order in an unintendedly way is known as catallactics.

For Hayek and the Austrian School, the number of individuals involved in the process of creating a social order defines the type of unintended consequence:

# If the process involves interactions and decision making of as many individuals (members of a society) as possible (thus gathering the greatest amount of knowledge dispersed among them), this process of &quot;catallaxy&quot; will lead to unexpected benefits (a social order and progress)
# On the other hand, attempts by individuals or limited groups (who lack all the necessary information) to achieve a new or better order, will end in unexpected drawbacks.

===Robert K. Merton===
Sociologist Robert K. Merton popularised this concept in the twentieth century.

In &quot;The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action&quot; (1936), Merton tried to apply a systematic analysis to the problem of unintended consequences of deliberate acts intended to cause social change. He emphasized that his term &quot;purposive action&quot;, &quot;[was exclusively] concerned with &#x27;conduct&#x27; as distinct from &#x27;behavior.&#x27; That is, with action that involves motives and consequently a choice between various alternatives&quot;. Merton&#x27;s usage included deviations from what Max Weber defined as rational social action: instrumentally rational and value rational. Merton also stated that &quot;no blanket statement categorically affirming or denying the practical feasibility of &quot;all&quot; social planning is warranted.&quot;

===Everyday usage===
More recently, the &quot;law of unintended consequences&quot; has come to be used as an adage or idiomatic warning that an intervention in a complex system tends to create unanticipated and often undesirable outcomes.

Akin to Murphy&#x27;s law, it is commonly used as a wry or humorous warning against the hubristic belief that humans can fully control the world around them, not to presuppose a belief in predestination or a lack or a disbelief in that of free will.

==Causes==
Possible causes of unintended consequences include the world&#x27;s inherent complexity (parts of a system responding to changes in the environment), perverse incentives, human stupidity, self-deception, failure to account for human nature, or other cognitive or emotional biases. As a sub-component of complexity (in the scientific sense), the chaotic nature of the universe—and especially its quality of having small, apparently insignificant changes with far-reaching effects (e.g., the butterfly effect)—applies.

In 1936, Robert K. Merton listed five possible causes of unanticipated consequences:

* Ignorance, making it impossible to anticipate everything, thereby leading to incomplete analysis.
* Errors in analysis of the problem or following habits that worked in the past but may not apply to the current situation.
* Immediate interests overriding long-term interests.
* Basic values which may require or prohibit certain actions even if the long-term result might be unfavourable (these long-term consequences may eventually cause changes in basic values).
* Self-defeating prophecy, or, the fear of some consequence which drives people to find solutions before the problem occurs, thus the non-occurrence of the problem is not anticipated.

In addition to Merton&#x27;s causes, psychologist Stuart Vyse has noted that groupthink, described by Irving Janis, has been blamed for some decisions that result in unintended consequences.

==Types==
===Unexpected benefits===

The creation of &quot;no-man&#x27;s lands&quot; during the Cold War, in places such as the border between Eastern and Western Europe, and the Korean Demilitarized Zone, has led to large natural habitats.
The sinking of ships in shallow waters during wartime has created many artificial coral reefs, which can be scientifically valuable and have become an attraction for recreational divers. This led to the deliberate sinking of retired ships for the purpose of replacing coral reefs lost to global warming and other factors.

In medicine, most drugs have unintended consequences (&#x27;side effects&#x27;) associated with their use. However, some are beneficial. For instance, aspirin, a pain reliever, is also an anticoagulant that can help prevent heart attacks and reduce the severity and damage from thrombotic strokes. The existence of beneficial side effects also leads to off-label use—prescription or use of a drug for an unlicensed purpose. Famously, the drug Viagra was developed to lower blood pressure, with its use for treating erectile dysfunction being discovered as a side effect in clinical trials.

===Unexpected drawbacks===
The implementation of a profanity filter by AOL in 1996 had the unintended consequence of blocking residents of Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, England, from creating accounts because of a false positive. The accidental censorship of innocent language, known as the Scunthorpe problem, has been repeated and widely documented.

In 1990, the Australian state of Victoria made safety helmets mandatory for all bicycle riders. While there was a reduction in the number of head injuries, there was also an unintended reduction in the number of juvenile cyclists—fewer cyclists obviously leads to fewer injuries, all else being equal. The risk of death and serious injury per cyclist seems to have increased, possibly because of risk compensation, or due to invisibilisation of cyclists. (the more a transportation method is uncommonly sighted, the likelier it could be deemed to be accident prone)

Research by Vulcan, &quot;et al.&quot; found that the reduction in juvenile cyclists was because the youths considered wearing a bicycle helmet unfashionable. A health-benefit model developed at Macquarie University in Sydney suggests that, while helmet use reduces &quot;the risk of head or brain injury by approximately two-thirds or more&quot;, the decrease in exercise caused by reduced cycling as a result of helmet laws is counterproductive in terms of net health.

Prohibition in the 1920s United States, originally enacted to suppress the alcohol trade, drove many small-time alcohol suppliers out of business and consolidated the hold of large-scale organized crime over the illegal alcohol industry. Since alcohol was still popular, criminal organisations producing alcohol were well-funded and hence also increased their other activities. Similarly, the War on Drugs, intended to suppress the illegal drug trade, instead increased the power and profitability of drug cartels who became the primary source of the products.

In CIA jargon, &quot;blowback&quot; describes the unintended, undesirable consequences of covert operations, such as the funding of the Afghan Mujahideen and the destabilization of Afghanistan contributing to the rise of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.

The introduction of exotic animals and plants for food, for decorative purposes, or to control unwanted species often leads to more harm than good done by the introduced species.
* The introduction of rabbits in Australia and New Zealand for food was followed by an explosive growth in the rabbit population; rabbits have become a major feral pest in these countries.
* Cane toads, introduced into Australia to control canefield pests, were unsuccessful and have become a major pest in their own right.
* Kudzu, introduced to the US as an ornamental plant in 1876 and later used to prevent erosion in earthworks, has become a major problem in the Southeastern United States. Kudzu has displaced native plants and has effectively taken over significant portions of land.

The protection of the steel industry in the United States reduced production of steel in the United States, increased costs to users, and increased unemployment in associated industries.

===Perverse results===
In 2003, Barbra Streisand unsuccessfully sued Kenneth Adelman and Pictopia.com for posting a photograph of her home online. Before the lawsuit had been filed, only 6 people had downloaded the file, two of them Streisand&#x27;s attorneys. The lawsuit drew attention to the image, resulting in 420,000 people visiting the site. The Streisand Effect was named after this incident, describing when an attempt to censor or remove a certain piece of information instead draws attention to the material being suppressed, resulting in the material instead becoming widely known, reported on, and distributed.

Passenger-side airbags in motorcars were intended as a safety feature, but led to an increase in child fatalities in the mid-1990s because small children were being hit by airbags that deployed automatically during collisions. The supposed solution to this problem, moving the child seat to the back of the vehicle, led to an increase in the number of children forgotten in unattended vehicles, some of whom died under extreme temperature conditions.

Risk compensation, or the Peltzman effect, occurs after implementation of safety measures intended to reduce injury or death (e.g. bike helmets, seatbelts, etc.). People may feel safer than they really are and take additional risks which they would not have taken without the safety measures in place. This may result in no change, or even an increase, in morbidity or mortality, rather than a decrease as intended.

According to an anecdote, the British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi, offered a bounty for every dead cobra. This was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, enterprising people began breeding cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, they scrapped the reward program, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free. As a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse, becoming known as the Cobra effect.

Theobald Mathew&#x27;s temperance campaign in 19th-century Ireland resulted in thousands of people vowing never to drink alcohol again. This led to the consumption of diethyl ether, a much more dangerous intoxicant—owing to its high flammability—by those seeking to become intoxicated without breaking the letter of their pledge.

It was thought that adding south-facing conservatories to British houses would reduce energy consumption by providing extra insulation and warmth from the sun. However, people tended to use the conservatories as living areas, installing heating and ultimately increasing overall energy consumption.

A reward for lost nets found along the Normandy coast was offered by the French government between 1980 and 1981. This resulted in people vandalizing nets to collect the reward.

Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1960s, the Canadian federal government gave Quebec $2.75 per day per psychiatric patient for their cost of care, but only $1.25 a day per orphan. The perverse result is that the orphan children were diagnosed as mentally ill so Quebec could receive the larger amount of money. This psychiatric misdiagnosis affected up to 20,000 people, and the children are known as the Duplessis Orphans in reference to the Premier of Quebec who oversaw the scheme, Maurice Duplessis.

There have been attempts to curb the consumption of sugary beverages by imposing a tax on them. However, a study found that the reduced consumption was only temporary. Also, there was an increase in the consumption of beer among households.

The New Jersey Childproof Handgun Law, which was intended to protect children from accidental discharge of firearms by forcing all future firearms sold in New Jersey to contain &quot;smart&quot; safety features, has delayed, if not stopped entirely, the introduction of such firearms to New Jersey markets. The wording of the law caused significant public backlash, fuelled by gun rights lobbyists, and several shop owners offering such guns received death threats and stopped stocking them. In 2014, 12 years after the law was passed, it was suggested the law be repealed if gun rights lobbyists agree not to resist the introduction of &quot;smart&quot; firearms.

Drug prohibition can lead drug traffickers to prefer stronger, more dangerous substances, that can be more easily smuggled and distributed than other, less concentrated substances.

Televised drug prevention advertisements may lead to increased drug use.

Increasing usage of search engines, also including recent image search features, has contributed in the ease of which media is consumed. Some abnormalities in usage may have shifted preferences for pornographic film actors, as the producers began using common search queries or tags to label the actors in new roles.

The passage of the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act has led to a reported increase in risky behaviors by sex workers as a result of quashing their ability to seek and screen clients online, forcing them back onto the streets or into the dark web. The ads posted were previously an avenue for advocates to reach out to those wanting to escape the trade.

The use of precision guided munitions meant to reduce the rate of civilian casualties encouraged armies to narrow their safety margins, and increase the use of deadly force in densely populated areas. This in turn increased the danger to uninvolved civilians, who in the past would have been out of the line of fire because of armies&#x27; aversion of using higher-risk weaponry in densely populated areas. The perceived ability to operate precision weaponry from afar (where in the past heavy munitions or troop deployment would have been needed) also led to the expansion of the list of potential targets. As put by Michael Walzer: &quot;Drones not only make it possible for us to get at our enemies, they may also lead us to broaden the list of enemies, to include presumptively hostile individuals and militant organizations simply because we can get at them–even if they aren&#x27;t actually involved in attacks against us.&quot; This idea is also echoed by Grégoire Chamayou: &quot;In a situation of moral hazard, military action is very likely to be deemed &#x27;necessary&#x27; simply because it is possible, and possible at a lower cost.&quot;

===Other===
According to Lynn White, the invention of the horse stirrup enabled new patterns of warfare that eventually led to the development of feudalism (see Stirrup Thesis).

==Perverse consequences of environmental intervention==
Most modern technologies have negative consequences that are both unavoidable and unpredictable. For example, almost all environmental problems, from chemical pollution to global warming, are the unexpected consequences of the application of modern technologies. Traffic congestion, deaths and injuries from car accidents, air pollution, and global warming are unintended consequences of the invention and large scale adoption of the automobile. Hospital infections are the unexpected side-effect of antibiotic resistance, and even human population growth leading to environmental degradation is the side effect of various technological (i.e., agricultural and industrial) revolutions.

Because of the complexity of ecosystems, deliberate changes to an ecosystem or other environmental interventions will often have (usually negative) unintended consequences. Sometimes, these effects cause permanent irreversible changes. Examples include:

* During the Four Pests campaign, Maoist China ordered the killing of sparrows, as well as rats, flies, and mosquitoes. Chinese leaders later realized that sparrows ate a large amount of insects. Rice yields after the campaign were substantially decreased; the campaign was one of the causes of the Great Chinese Famine. 
* During the Great Plague of London a killing of dogs and cats was ordered. If left untouched, they would have made a significant reduction in the rat population that carried the fleas which transmitted the disease.
* The installation of smokestacks to decrease pollution in local areas, resulting in spread of pollution at a higher altitude, and acid rain on an international scale.
* After about 1900, public demand led the US government to fight forest fires in the American West, and set aside land as national forests and parks to protect them from fires. This policy led to fewer fires, but also led to growth conditions such that, when fires did occur, they were much larger and more damaging. Modern research suggests that this policy was misguided, and that a certain level of wildfires is a natural and important part of forest ecology.
*Side effects of climate engineering to counter global warming could involve even further warming as a consequence of reflectivity-reducing afforestation or crop yield reductions and rebound effects after solar dimming measures with even more accelerated warming.

<doc id="97518" wikidata="Q215719" url="?curid=97518" title="Hunedoara">
<text>Hunedoara (; ; ) is a city in Hunedoara County, Transylvania, Romania. It is located in southwestern Transylvania near the Poiana Ruscă Mountains, and administers five villages: Boș (&quot;Bós&quot;), Groș (&quot;Grós&quot;), Hășdat (&quot;Hosdát&quot;; &quot;Hochstätten&quot;), Peștișu Mare (&quot;Alpestes&quot;), and Răcăștia (&quot;Rákosd&quot;).

The city includes the most important Gothic-style secular building in Transylvania: the Hunyad Castle, which is closely connected with the Hunyadi family. The castle was destroyed by fire five times, but underwent many reconstructions from Austro-Hungarian and later Romanian authorities. Besides the castle, the town developed as a production center for iron and a market for the mountain regions nearby. During the 20th century, Hunedoara&#x27;s population increased to 86,000 inhabitants. The city contained the largest steel works in Romania (until Galați took the lead), but activity gradually diminished after the fall of the Iron Curtain due to the loss of the market. This was a blow to the overall prosperity of the town, which is now recovering through new investments.

The population consists of a Romanian majority, with Hungarians and Roma as the most important minorities. The city contains numerous parks, with poplars and chestnut trees flanking the streets. There are many tourist attractions, including a large dam with tourist facilities, located in the mountains a few kilometers from the city.

==Etymology==
The name of the town seems inexorably linked to the name of the Hunyadi family (also known as Corvinus). The most probable explanation for the Romanian name &quot;Hunedoara&quot; is the transliteration of the Hungarian name &quot;Hunyadvár&quot; meaning &quot;Castle of Hunyad&quot;, as many Hungarian towns have this suffix. Historically, the following names were recorded: &quot;Hungnod&quot; (1265), &quot;Huniad&quot; (1278), &quot;Hwnyadwar&quot; (1409), &quot;Vayda Hunyadi&quot; (1575). The latter Hungarian name &quot;Vajdahunyad&quot; (voivode Hunyad) is a direct referral to John Hunyadi.

The German name &quot;Eisenmarkt&quot; means &quot;Iron Market&quot;, doubtless a reference by German merchants to the city&#x27;s thriving iron trade from Carpathian mines.

==History==
Stone Age tools were discovered in the Sânpetru (Saint Peter) hill near the castle and in the surrounding villages. The region was very rich in iron, which had been extracted in the area since the Iron Age by Thracian tribes. The Dacian fortresses of Orăștie mountains, most notably Sarmiszegetusa, which became the most important religious and political center of Dacia, was located close to Hunedoara and was supplied by the iron produced here. The remains of eight Dacian iron furnaces have been found at the Sânpetru Hill near the castle. The discovery of important monetary treasures of Dacian coins and Roman imperial coins testifies to the importance of the site.

After Dacia was conquered around 106 AD and turned into a Roman province, the iron-rich region attracted the attention of the Romans, who began to exploit it by building furnaces. A &quot;Villa Rustica&quot; emerged in Teliuc, a Roman fortification on Sanpetru hill, outpost of the famous legio XIII Gemina whose main castrum was at Apullum in Dacia. Other Roman artifacts were discovered in the city area, and also in Pestis, where the remains of a Roman village were discovered. The new capital city of the Roman province of Dacia, Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, was also situated in the proximity.

After the Roman military and administrative retreat during the Migration Period, the region had no significant historic sites, although it may be possible that the iron activity continued. The ethnic structure of the region changed significantly, most notably with Goths, Huns, Slavs, Pechenegs, Magyars, and Cumans.

There is an ongoing scholarly debate over the ethnicity of Transylvania&#x27;s population before the Hungarian conquest (see Origin of the Romanians). After 1000, as part of the Kingdom of Hungary, under Slavic influence small political feuds grew (ruled by knjazes). South of the Carpathians the Pechenegs and Cumans held political power, and Hunedoara acted as a buffer zone for the Hungarian Crown. In time, the Vlach populations in the mountains nearby developed an original highlander culture. Their land is called &quot;Țara Pădurenilor&quot; (Woodlanders Country) and they began to dominate the area demographically. The region also had a sizable population of German Saxons, colonizers brought by the Hungarian Crown after the Mongol Invasion and later, Romani who migrated from the Indian subcontinent.

The first recorded evidence of the city was made in 1265 under the name Hungnod as a hub for leather tanning and wool processing. The city of Hunedoara became an important iron extracting and processing center in Transylvania. &quot;Corpus Inscriptiorum Latinorum&quot; refers to a local inhabitant as &quot;natas ibi, ubi ferum nascitur&quot;, that is, &quot;born where the iron was born&quot;. As the backbone for the manufacture of weapons and tools, the town industry was vital for the region.

The city has been known since the 14th century mainly as the residence of the Hunyadi family. On 18 October 1409, Voyk (Vajk in Hungarian, Voicu in Romanian), was rewarded for military bravery by Sigismund of Luxembourg, and received the domain of Hunedoara. The origins of the Hunyadi family are a topic of ongoing debate among historians. The same document that recorded Voyk&#x27;s reward for military bravery by Sigismund of Luxembourg also mentions his three sons: Mogoș, Radu, and John Hunyadi (Hungarian: János Hunyadi; Romanian: Ioan de Hunedoara). Hunedoara received town privileges in 1448 from the King of Hungary. John Hunyadi consolidated the citadel on top of an ancient fortress, creating the two main halls, for Diet and Knights. A Franciscan abbey was built nearby the castle in 1448 and John of Capistrano, a famous Italian monk, was sent by the Pope to organize a crusade against the Turks, and lived in the castle. John of Capistrano became instrumental later in inciting the peasantry to crusade, starting from Frankfurt and marching towards Belgrade.

John Hunyadi was a leading military leader in the growing confrontation with the Ottoman Empire. He fought in the service of Sigismund, mastering military tactics in the Hussite Wars, and became the most skillful warrior of Hungary. He was elevated and named Voivode (Prince) of Transylvania, which was at the time an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Elected regent of Hungary, he formed a coalition with the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia and engaged in crusades against the Turks to free Serbia and Bulgaria. The crusade, for a brief period, united the diverging forces of the Balkans, and the victories gained in battles managed to secure the Kingdom of Hungary from Ottoman occupation for over a century. Although he died in a military camp, his son Mátyás (Matthias Corvinus) later became the most famous of Hungarian kings. Pope Pope Pius II called him Athleta Christi (&quot;Christ&#x27;s Champion&quot;) and The White Knight of Wallachia.

In 1457 Matthias gave permission to the Wallachian serfs to build an Orthodox church, beautifully decorated with paintings and preserved until today. He continued to consolidate the castle and the feudal domain of Hunedoara. The castle of Hunedoara became one of the biggest in the medieval world, standing as a witness to the greatness of his family of noble warriors and statesmen, in an era of war and despair for the region, as the Ottoman Empire approached Central Europe. In the times of Hunyadi rule, Hunedoara became a market (opiddum) for iron. Matthias Corvinus named the city a tax-free area, and this privilege lasted until the 17th century. The population varied between 784 people in 1512 and 896 people in the 17th century. After Matthias died, Hunedoara passed to his son, John (Hungarian: János; Romanian: Ioan), but he too died young. His wife, Beatrice de Frangepan, married Georg of Hohenzollern, Marquis of Brandenburg in 1509. But Georg de Brandenburg would not reside in Hunedoara, instead appointed a representative, György Stolcz.

In 1514, during the peasant revolt of György Dózsa, some were imprisoned in the castle and probably tortured. The town numbered 184 houses, a considerable size for the time, and was ruled by an appointed Orthodox priest. In 1528 a fire destroyed 124 houses. In 1534 as the Kingdom of Hungary was conquered by the Ottoman Turks, the castle was besieged during the rebellion of Czibak Imre, the bishop of Oradea and two years later John Zápolya donated the castle along with other possessions to Török Bálint making him the richest nobleman of Hungary. In 1557 Török János, a proselytizer of Reformation is mentioned to have killed his unfaithful wife Kendi Anna in the castle. In 1601 the castle was besieged by the Wallachian army of Michael the Brave in his campaign – while ruling Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania – against the Ottoman Empire, and to switch the Ottoman vassalage to the Habsburgs.

The town and the castle survived relatively unharmed by the Counter-Reformation of Giorgio Basta, general of the Habsburg Empire. By 1618, ownership of the castle passed to the Bethlen family. Gabriel Bethlen Voivode of Transylvania consolidated and enlarged the castle, and gave it to his nephew Stephen Betlen who lived here with his wife Mary Széchy, famed for her beauty.

The Reformed Church of Hungary was established in Hunedoara in 1634 and Imre Thököly, one of the leaders of the Protestant anti-Habsburg uprising and later Prince of Transylvania owned the castle and spent much time living in it. By 1685, the castle passed into the possession of Michael Apafi, the pro-Habsburg Prince of Transylvania. In 1710, the old church was returned to the Franciscans, and in 1725 it reacquired its monastic rank. By this time, the majority of population was Romanian.

Most of current Hunedoara was at that time a lush plain through which the Cerna river was meandering. The first blast furnace was built by 1603, followed by another four. The modern iron operations began at the foot of Saint Peter hill (Sanpetru), close to the most distant tower of the castle called Nebojša, (Serbian for &quot;have no fear&quot;, a tower that was the furthest away from the castle in medieval times, to provide last refuge in the case of a siege; cf. Nebojša Tower). The mine shaft can still be viewed. Iron manufactures were also situated nearby.

In 1667 there was already a steel mill on the Cerna river producing 490 tons of pig iron and 66 tons of iron by 1699. In 1714 Georg Steinhilbert made a second one and a third was made in 1727. In 1743 the operations were handled directly by the Treasury. Of the mills mentioned, one was located under the main bridge and its walls are now in ruins.

The first tall industrial furnace in the world for iron extracting, it has been argued, was built in 1750 in Topliţa near Hunedoara, and a later one in Govăşdia in 1806. Both furnaces can be visited today. To reach it by road could only be through Teliucu Inferior (Alsótelek then) and Teliucu Superior (Felsőtelek then). Until 2001, there was a system of narrow-gauge railway built in the 19th and 20th centuries that ran from Hunedoara castle, near Zlaşti through a 747 and a 42 meter long tunnel through the mountain, and the breathtaking landscape of &quot;Ţara Pădurenilor&quot; (Woodlanders&#x27; country) before arriving to Govăjdia. It was dismantled and scrapped from Zlaşti to Govăjdia and Crăciuneasa by the last owner the Talc-Dolomită Zlaşti company. The last remaining long narrow-gauge rail system from the Hunedoara castle to Zlaşti was in use by the Talc-Dolomită Zlaşti company till 2007. In the summer of 2009 they have removed this last remaining section of this line. There are efforts now for restoring the train line for tourism purposes.

In the 18th and part of the 19th century, as the town of Hunedoara became more and more industrialized, peasants from regions nearby began to move to the city and the population increased. Only the German, Hungarian and Székelys of Transylvania were represented in the Diet (see Unio Trium Nationum). The Romanians who at the time formed about approx. 50% of the population felt exploited and revolted on several occasions. The peasants of Hunedoara county supported the Revolt of Horea, Cloşca and Crişan in 1784, when they unsuccessfully besieged the nearby fortress of Deva.

The castle in Hunedoara gave refuge to the local nobility, and it was its last function as military defense. Later representatives from the region were sent to the Romanian national assemblies held in Blaj during the 1848 Revolution where Romanians decided to demand equal rights and resist the attempt of Hungary of gaining independence from the Habsburg House. This started a small scale insurrection across Transylvania that was quickly quieted by the Hungarian army, except for the Apuseni Mountains, on the north of Hunedoara, where the tribune Avram Iancu struggled to keep the Hungarian forces away from controlling the gold mines. The subsequent failures of the later Austro-Hungarian monarchy to fulfill to the demands of the Romanians together with the Magyarization campaigns further exacerbated and alienated the Romanian population of Hunedoara.

During World War I the Romanians from Hunedoara county actively supported the Romanian Army and the Romanian National Assembly declared the Union of Transylvania with Romania in 1918. After the ending of the war Transylvania became part of Romania. The Romanian populations in and around the city quickly earned political rights and representation, and industrial development continued at an ever-increasing rate.

During World War II the steel works were part of the war effort for the Axis. The Romanian Army lost 700,000 soldiers on the Eastern Front and the Allies, an additional 400,000 soldiers fighting against the Axis.

After the Soviet occupation and the subsequent communist regime, industry was favored, and Hunedoara had for a time the biggest steel-producing plant in Romania and the Balkans. The city grew larger, and the factories extended so much that they equaled or exceeded the size of the city. The population also increased to over 87,000. The football team, Corvinul Hunedoara, was for a very long time one of the highest-rated football teams in Romania, rivaling Steaua or Dinamo. A large stadium was built along with other sports facilities such as covered swimming pools and a skating ring. Besides the Corvinul sports club, two other sport clubs were constructed, Constructorul and Siderurgistul, each offering different sport facilities. Other notable constructions included a theater house, several large cinemas, many schools and high-schools and an engineering faculty.

The communist collapse meant that the old markets for steel vanished, and many enterprises had to be closed or abandoned. However, investment from Romanian and foreign capital ventures started offering new job opportunities for the people. Currently Arcelor-Mittal runs what is left of the steel works. The steel mill now operates the No. 2 Electric Steel Mill, Continuous Caster and the rolling mills. Production is scheduled to rise above 500,000 tons of steel in 2007 and beyond. The rest of the production facilities have been demolished or have been sold to private investors.

==Demographics==
Before modern times, the ethnic balance of Hunedoara was more diverse, as was the case elsewhere in the region. During the rise of nationalism in the region the Romanians already had a solid majority and there was little of the ethnic friction that were to be found elsewhere in Transylvania (see Magyarization and Romanianization).

The 1850 census registered 1,937 residents, consisting of 1,275 Romanians, 248 Hungarians, 237 Germans, 101 Slovaks and 86 Roma. The religious denominations included 992 Orthodox, 370 Greek Catholics, 316 Roman Catholics, 181 Reformed, 42 Evangelic and 36 Jews. The 1900 census registered 4,419 residents, consisting of 1,987 Romanians, 1,896 Hungarians, 365 Germans, and 101 Slovaks.

The number of Hungarians dwindled after the Treaty of Trianon of 1920 when Transylvania became part of Romania, while the fall of Communism in December 1989 saw most German families leaving the town and the country to Germany.

During the Communist era, as the Steel Works were functioning the population peaked at 89,000, as workers moved in from the surrounding countryside as well as Oltenia and Moldavia. In the transition era that followed the fall of communism, a large percentage of the Romanian population lost their jobs and many left the town in search for better opportunities elsewhere. According to the latest census, from 2021, there were 50,457 people living within the city of Hunedoara. At the 2011 census, the city had a population 57,524, making it the 32nd largest city in Romania. The ethnic makeup was as follows:
* Romanians: 92.13%
* Hungarians: 5.19%
* Roma: 1.74%
* Others (mostly Transylvanian Saxons): 0.85%

==Natives==

*Mihaela Miroiu (born 1955), political theorist and feminist philosopher
*Siegfried Mureșan (born 1981), economist and politician
*Marius Stan, (born 1957), football player and politician

==Attractions==

=== Hunyadi / Corvin Castle ===
The Corvin Castle, also known as Hunyadi Castle or Hunedoara Castle (Romanian: &quot;Castelul Huniazilor&quot; or &quot;Castelul Corvinilor;&quot; Hungarian: &quot;Vajdahunyadi vár&quot;), is a Gothic-Renaissance castle in Hunedoara. It is one of the largest castles in Europe and is featured as one of the Seven Wonders of Romania. The Castle is known both by the name Corvin&#x27;s Castle and Hunyadi or Hunedoara Castle. Hunyadi is the internationally more recognized name for the same family, Corvin being used mostly by Romanians.

The impressive size and architectural beauty sets it among the most impressive monuments of medieval art, with subsequent developments added Gothic and then Renaissance and Baroque. The building lies on a rock around which flows the Zlaști River. It has an impressive draw bridge, countless towers, a number of interior courts, and two large halls, &quot;Knight Hall&quot; and &quot;Diet Hall&quot;, as it housed the Diet of Transylvania for a short period.

The castle history is mostly related to the Hunyadi family, being the place where John Hunyadi spent his childhood. Today the castle is being cared for by the municipality, as there are no recorded descendants of the Hunyadi that could pledge for it. Vlad Dracul, the ruler of Wallachia, the father of the notorious Vlad Dracula, was imprisoned here, as he had fallen into disgrace with Hunyadi, not providing the help promised (Dracula, who had once been traded as a hostage to the Ottomans by his own father, later became a protégé of Hunyadi, and took over Wallachia shortly before his mentor&#x27;s death of fever). The castle and surroundings are often used by international film companies for the production of movies about medieval times.

<text>The boline (also spelled &quot;bolline&quot;, pron.: boh-leen) is a white-handled ritual knife, one of several magical tools used in Wicca, mainly for the cutting of herbs and inscribing candles.

==Description==
Unlike the athame, which in most traditions is never used for actual physical cutting, the boline is used for cutting cords and herbs, carving candles, etc. It has a small, straight or crescent-shaped blade with, traditionally, a white handle.

==Purpose==
The boline has been adopted by several other modern forms of witchcraft including Eclectic Wicca. Among these later traditions opinions vary as to whether the boline is truly a magical tool or is merely of utilitarian purpose. Similarly, sometimes a white-hilted knife called a &quot;kirfane&quot; (various spellings) is used, for roughly the same purposes as the boline.
According to the Kitchen Witchcraft philosophy, the use of magical tools for mundane purposes like cooking is actively encouraged, and as such there is little or no need for a boline as a separate tool from the athame. Some traditions, such as that of Robert Cochrane, also prescribe the use of a single knife for both ritual and practical purposes.

==&quot;Key of Solomon&quot;==
Many of the bolines advertised in on-line &quot;magick shops&quot; have a characteristic crescent shape, and are described as being for harvesting herbs. This crescent shape is reminiscent of the sickle described in the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot;, a medieval grimoire and one of the sources for modern Wicca.

Confusingly, an Italian version of the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; has a hook-shaped knife called an &quot;artauo&quot; (a possible root for athame) and a straight, needle-shaped blade called a &quot;bolino&quot;. When the name &quot;boline&quot; was first used to describe the crescent-shaped blade is not clear. In &quot;The Book of Ceremonial Magic&quot; published by Arthur Edward Waite in 1911, Waite references a number of early works on magic which mention the &quot;bolline&quot; or &quot;sickle&quot;, saying &quot;Among the necessary properties mentioned by the Book of &quot;True Black Magic&quot; are the sword, the staff, the rod, the lancet, the arctrave or hook, the bolline or sickle, the needle, the poniard, a white-handled knife and another knife, with a black handle, used to describe the circle. The most important to make is that called the bolline...&quot;

<text>Roberto Formigoni (born 30 March 1947) is an Italian politician. He was the president of Lombardy from 1995 to 2013. He is the former unofficial political spokesperson of the Communion and Liberation movement. On 21 February 2019, the Supreme Court of Cassation, the highest court in Italy, found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him to a definitive jail term of 5 years and 10 months. As a result, he was detained in the prison of Bollate, near Milan, for a few months in 2019 before getting house arrest. He was released in November 2023.

==Career==
Born in Lecco in the Lombardy region, Formigoni began his political career early in Christian Democracy through youth movements, such as &quot;Gioventù Studentesca&quot; and Communion and Liberation, of which he became the unofficial political spokesman. In 1976, he founded the Popular Movement and was elected a deputy in both the European Parliament (with over 450,000 votes) and Italian Parliament. He was also the vice-president of the European Parliament for five years and served as undersecretary of state for the Ministry of the Environment in the Italian government.

In 1990, Formigoni garnered attention when he was involved in a mission to Iraq that successfully concluded with the freeing of some Italian technicians who were hostages of the local government. He later took part in the oil-for-food programme for Iraq, buying 1,000,000 oil barrels (160,000 cubic metres). The move sparked controversy and linked him to alleged bribe scandals. In 1995, he and Rocco Buttiglione founded the United Christian Democrats party. In 1998, he moved to Forza Italia, when Buttiglione briefly decided to support the government of Massimo D&#x27;Alema.

In 1995, Formigoni was elected president of Lombardy. Leftist groups opposed his centre-right platform. Formigoni was re-elected in 2000 carrying over 62% of the approximately 3.5 million votes, and in 2005 with almost 54% of the approximately 2.8 million votes. He was elected to a fourth term in March 2010 with 56% of the approximately 2.7 million votes. His candidature had been contested by academics and left-wing politicians, as in disregard of Law no. 165/2004, which put a limit of two consecutive mandates to directly elected regional presidents. Formigoni was indirectly elected in 1995 but then directly elected in 2000 and 2005. He defended himself, stating that the law was not in vigour when he was first directly elected in 2000, so he should be allowed a fourth mandate. According to some scholars, his mandate could have been overturned by judges later on.

==Controversies==
Formigoni candidated the Italian showgirl Nicole Minetti and dental hygienist of the former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who asked for a political seat for her, and this was contested by Italian newspapers. On 16 October 2012, Formigoni announced the dissolution of the regional legislature after one of his commissioners, Domenico Zambetti of the People of Freedom, was arrested on accusations he bought votes from the &#x27;Ndrangheta in 2010 and extorted favours and public building contracts, including construction tenders for the World Expo 2015 in Milan.

==Italian court sentences against Formigoni==
=== 2000s: Bribery and environmental pollution===
In 2002, Formigoni was judged for bribery due the landfill in Cerro Maggiore. In December 2009, Formigoni was tried illegal environmental pollution.

=== 2010s: Freemasonry, criminal association, and defamatory behavior against Italian judges===
Formigoni was interrogated by Italian Court in Rome due the Propaganda Due (P2) Freemasonry group. In July 2012, he was sentenced to 1 year of imprisonment due defamation. In January 2014, he was convicted of defaming the Italian judge, Alfredo Robledo.

On 25 July 2012, Formigoni was convicted of bribery by Italian courts. On 12 February 2013, he was investigated due criminal group activities. On 3 March 2014, Formigoni was convicted for criminal association activities and bribery. On 15 April 2016, the prosecution asked to sentence Formigoni to 9 years of prison and described him as a &quot;boss of criminal group&quot; due his tactical bribery attitudes that lasted more than 10 years while he managed more than 70 million euro public money.

<doc id="97528" wikidata="Q271943" url="?curid=97528" title="Isoprene">
<text>Isoprene, or 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, is a common volatile organic compound with the formula CH2=C(CH3)−CH=CH2. In its pure form it is a colorless volatile liquid. It is produced by many plants and animals (including humans) and its polymers are the main component of natural rubber.

== History and etymology ==
C. G. Williams named the compound in 1860 after obtaining it from the pyrolysis of natural rubber. He correctly deduced the mass shares of carbon and hydrogen (but due to modern atomic weight of carbon not yet adopted at the Karlsruhe Congress arrived at an incorrect formula C10H8). He didn&#x27;t specify the reasons for the name, but it&#x27;s hypothesized that it came from &quot;propylene&quot; with which isoprene shares some physical and chemical properties. The first one to observe recombination of isoprene into rubber-like substance was in 1879, and William A. Tilden identified its structure five years later.

==Natural occurrences==

Isoprene is produced and emitted by many species of trees (major producers are oaks, poplars, eucalyptus, and some legumes). Yearly production of isoprene emissions by vegetation is around 600 million metric tons, half from tropical broadleaf trees and the remainder primarily from shrubs. This is about equivalent to methane emissions and accounts for around one-third of all hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere. In deciduous forests, isoprene makes up approximately 80% of hydrocarbon emissions. While their contribution is small compared to trees, microscopic and macroscopic algae also produce isoprene.

===Plants===
Isoprene is made through the methyl-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway (MEP pathway, also called the non-mevalonate pathway) in the chloroplasts of plants. One of the two end-products of MEP pathway, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), is cleaved by the enzyme isoprene synthase to form isoprene and diphosphate. Therefore, inhibitors that block the MEP pathway, such as fosmidomycin, also block isoprene formation. Isoprene emission increases dramatically with temperature and maximizes at around 40 °C. This has led to the hypothesis that isoprene may protect plants against heat stress (thermotolerance hypothesis, see below). Emission of isoprene is also observed in some bacteria and this is thought to come from non-enzymatic degradations from DMAPP. Global emission of isoprene by plants is estimated at 350 million tons per year.

====Regulation====
Isoprene emission in plants is controlled both by the availability of the substrate (DMAPP) and by enzyme (isoprene synthase) activity. In particular, light, CO2 and O2 dependencies of isoprene emission are controlled by substrate availability, whereas temperature dependency of isoprene emission is regulated both by substrate level and enzyme activity.

=== Human &amp; other organisms ===
Isoprene is the most abundant hydrocarbon measurable in the breath of humans. The estimated production rate of isoprene in the human body is 0.15 μmol/(kg·h), equivalent to approximately 17 mg/day for a person weighing 70 kg. Human breath isoprene originates from lipolytic cholesterol metabolism within the skeletal muscular peroxisomes and &quot;IDI2&quot; gene acts as the production determinant. Due to the absence of &quot;IDI2&quot; gene, animals such as pigs and bottle-nose dolphins do not exhale isoprene.

Isoprene is common in low concentrations in many foods. Many species of soil and marine bacteria, such as Actinomycetota, are capable of degrading isoprene and using it as a fuel source. 
==Biological roles==
Isoprene emission appears to be a mechanism that trees use to combat abiotic stresses. In particular, isoprene has been shown to protect against moderate heat stress (around 40 °C). It may also protect plants against large fluctuations in leaf temperature. Isoprene is incorporated into and helps stabilize cell membranes in response to heat stress.

Isoprene also confers resistance to reactive oxygen species. The amount of isoprene released from isoprene-emitting vegetation depends on leaf mass, leaf area, light (particularly photosynthetic photon flux density, or PPFD) and leaf temperature. Thus, during the night, little isoprene is emitted from tree leaves, whereas daytime emissions are expected to be substantial during hot and sunny days, up to 25 μg/(g dry-leaf-weight)/hour in many oak species.

===Isoprenoids===
The isoprene skeleton can be found in naturally occurring compounds called terpenes and terpenoid (oxygenated terpenes), collectively called isoprenoids. These compounds do not arise from isoprene itself. Instead, the precursor to isoprene units in biological systems is dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and its isomer isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). The plural &#x27;isoprenes&#x27; is sometimes used to refer to terpenes in general.

Examples of isoprenoids include carotene, phytol, retinol (vitamin A), tocopherol (vitamin E), dolichols, and squalene. Heme A has an isoprenoid tail, and lanosterol, the sterol precursor in animals, is derived from squalene and hence from isoprene. The functional isoprene units in biological systems are dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and its isomer isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), which are used in the biosynthesis of naturally occurring isoprenoids such as carotenoids, quinones, lanosterol derivatives (e.g. steroids) and the prenyl chains of certain compounds (e.g. phytol chain of chlorophyll). Isoprenes are used in the cell membrane monolayer of many Archaea, filling the space between the diglycerol tetraether head groups. This is thought to add structural resistance to harsh environments in which many Archaea are found.

Similarly, natural rubber is composed of linear polyisoprene chains of very high molecular weight and other natural molecules.


==Industrial production==
Isoprene is most readily available industrially as a byproduct of the thermal cracking of petroleum naphtha or oil, as a side product in the production of ethylene. Where thermal cracking of oil is less common, isoprene can be produced by dehydrogenation of isopentane. Isoprene can be synthesized in two steps from isobutylene, starting with its ene reaction with formaldehyde to give isopentenol, which can be dehydrated to isoprene: 
Where cheap acetylene is produced from coal-derived calcium carbide, it may be combined with acetone to make 3-methylbutynol which is then hydrogenated and dehydrated to isoprene.

About 800,000 metric tons are produced annually. About 95% of isoprene production is used to produce cis-1,4-polyisoprene—a synthetic version of natural rubber.

Natural rubber consists mainly of poly-cis-isoprene with a molecular mass of 100,000 to 1,000,000 g/mol. Typically natural rubber contains a few percent of other materials, such as proteins, fatty acids, resins, and inorganic materials. Some natural rubber sources, called gutta percha, are composed of trans-1,4-polyisoprene, a structural isomer that has similar, but not identical, properties.

<text>Deva (; Hungarian: &quot;Déva&quot;, ; German: &quot;Diemrich&quot;, &quot;Schlossberg&quot;, &quot;Denburg&quot;; Latin: &quot;Sargetia&quot;; is a city in Romania, in the historical region of Transylvania, on the left bank of the river Mureș. It is the capital of Hunedoara County.

==Name==
Its name was first recorded in 1269 as castrum &quot;Dewa&quot;. The origin of the name gave rise to controversy. It is considered that the name comes from the ancient Dacian word &quot;dava&quot;, meaning &quot;fortress&quot; (as in &quot;Pelendava&quot;, &quot;Piroboridava&quot;, or &quot;Zargidava&quot;). Other theories trace the name to a Roman Legion, the Legio II Augusta, transferred to Deva from Castrum Deva, now Chester (&quot;Deva Victrix&quot;) in Britain. János András Vistai assume the name is of old Turkic origin from the name Gyeücsa. Others assert that the name is probably of Slavic origin where &quot;Deva&quot; or &quot;Devín&quot; means &quot;girl&quot; or &quot;maiden&quot; (a similar case exists in Slovakian for the Devín Castle, located at the confluence of the Danube and Great Morava, at the site of the former town of Devín) or from the Old Hungarian name Győ. Additionally, it is possible the name Deva was derived from the reconstructed proto-Indo-European &quot;dhewa&quot; (&quot;settlement&quot;). On medieval maps &quot;Deva&quot; appears as: &quot;Dewan&quot; (first mention), &quot;Deva&quot;, or later &quot;Diemrich&quot;.

==History==
Documentary evidence of the city&#x27;s existence first appeared in 1269 when Stephen V, King of Hungary and Duke of Transilvania, mentioned &quot;the royal castle of Deva&quot; in a privilege-grant for the Count Chyl of Kelling (). Partially destroyed by the Ottoman Turks in 1550, it was afterward rebuilt and the fortress extended. In 1621 Prince Gabriel Bethlen transformed and extended the Magna Curia Palace (also known as the Bethlen Castle) in Renaissance style.
In 1711–1712, Deva was settled by a group of Roman Catholic Bulgarian merchant refugees from the unsuccessful anti-Ottoman Chiprovtsi Uprising of 1688. The refugees were originally mostly from Chiprovtsi and Zhelezna, though also from the neighbouring Kopilovtsi and Klisura. However, the refugees came to Deva from Wallachia and from Alvinc (now &quot;Vinţu de Jos&quot;, Romania), where a similar colony had been established in 1700.

They numbered in 1716 51 families and three Franciscan friars, established their own neighbourhood, which was known to the locals as &quot;Greci&quot; (&quot;Greeks&quot;, i.e. &quot;merchants&quot;). Their influence over local affairs caused Deva to be officially called a &quot;Bulgarian town&quot; for a short period, even though the maximum population of the colony was 71 families in 1721. The Bulgarians received royal privileges of the Austrian crown along with their permission to settle and their acquisition of land and property. The construction of Deva&#x27;s Franciscan friary commenced in 1724 with the funding and efforts of its Bulgarian population, so that the monastery was commonly known as the Bulgarian Monastery. However, the Great Plague of 1738 and the gradual assimilation of the Deva Bulgarians into other ethnicities of Transylvania prevented the colony from growing and by the late 19th century the Bulgarian ethnic element in the town had disappeared completely. 

===Jewish history===

Jews first settled in the town in the 1830s, organizing a community in 1848. Rabbi Moshe Herzog (1893-1898) delivered patriotic sermons in Hungarian. The synagogue was rebuilt in 1925. In 1923, the strictly Orthodox established their own congregation under Hayyim Yehuda Ehrenreich, a rabbinical scholar whose periodical &quot;Otzar ha-Hayyim&quot; became renowned in Jewish academic circles. In 1927, he set up a press that printed classical Hebrew works.

Zionist organizations were especially active in the mid-1920s. In 1930, there were 914 Jews, or 8.7% of the total. On 5 December 1940, during the National Legionary State, Jewish merchants were forced to give up their shops to members of the ruling Iron Guard. In June 1941, when Romania entered World War II, 695 Jewish refugees from surrounding villages were brought to Deva. In the war&#x27;s aftermath, many remained there. There were 1190 Jews in 1947; the majority emigrated to Israel after 1948.

==Geography==
Deva is situated in the central part of Hunedoara County, on the left bank of the middle course of the Mureș River at 187 m above sea level. The city administers four villages: Archia (&quot;Árki&quot;), Bârcea Mică (&quot;Kisbarcsa&quot;), Cristur (&quot;Csernakeresztúr&quot;) and Sântuhalm (&quot;Szántóhalma&quot;).

==Demographics==
In 1850, the town had 2,129 inhabitants, of which 1,038 were Romanians (48.8%), 517 Hungarians (24.3%), 255 Germans (12%), 216 Roma (10.1%) and 103 (4.8%) of other ethnicities, meanwhile in 1910, out of 8,654 inhabitants, 5,827 were Hungarians (67.33%), 2,417 Romanians (27.92%), 276 Germans (3.18%) and 134 (1.57%) of other ethnicities.

At the 2011 census, there were 56,647 people living within the city, making it the 37th largest city in Romania. The ethnic makeup in 2011 was as follows: 89.67% Romanians, 7.79% Hungarians, 1.6% Roma, and 0.91% other. At the 2021 census, Deva had a population of 53,113; of those, 74.28% were Romanians, 5.33% Hungarians, and 19.42% other.

==Economy==
Automotive, commerce, construction materials and power industries are important to Deva&#x27;s economy.

== Education ==
A private University of Ecology and Tourism was established in the city in 1990, and the academic centres of Timișoara and Cluj-Napoca have opened branches in the city. Deva is also the home of Romania&#x27;s national women gymnastics training center called Colegiul National Sportiv &quot;Cetatea&quot; Deva .

== Climate ==
Deva has a humid continental climate (Koppen: Dfb) with warm summers and cold winters. Precipitation peaks in the month of June.

==Tourism==
Deva is dominated by the Citadel Hill, a protected nature reserve because of its rare floral species and the presence of the horned adder. Perched on the top of the hill are the ruins of the Citadel built in the 13th century. Tourists can visit the Citadel by climbing the hill or using the cable car. The machinery covers a distance of 160 meters and it can transport up to 16 people.

Deva&#x27;s tourist attractions include the Arts Theatre, the Patria Cinema, the Old Centre and the Citadel Park, where there are the statues of Mihai Eminescu and Decebal and the Magna Curia Palace. There is also the Aqualand Complex, a recently built leisure centre situated near the Citadel Park. It is an important tourist spot for the Transylvania region. Downtown the city, the House of culture and the musical fountain represent two elements that define the town centre of Deva.
==Sport==
Deva is considered the &quot;Gymnastics capital of Romania&quot; because the National gymnastics training center is located in the city. Many of the country&#x27;s Olympic gymnasts have trained in Deva, including Nadia Comăneci.

<doc id="97536" wikidata="Q337897" url="?curid=97536" title="Modern synthesis (20th century)">
<text>The modern synthesis was the early 20th-century synthesis of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution and Gregor Mendel&#x27;s ideas on heredity into a joint mathematical framework. Julian Huxley coined the term in his 1942 book, &quot;&quot;. The synthesis combined the ideas of natural selection, Mendelian genetics, and population genetics. It also related the broad-scale macroevolution seen by palaeontologists to the small-scale microevolution of local populations.

The synthesis was defined differently by its founders, with Ernst Mayr in 1959, G. Ledyard Stebbins in 1966, and Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1974 offering differing basic postulates, though they all include natural selection, working on heritable variation supplied by mutation. Other major figures in the synthesis included E. B. Ford, Bernhard Rensch, Ivan Schmalhausen, and George Gaylord Simpson. An early event in the modern synthesis was R. A. Fisher&#x27;s 1918 paper on mathematical population genetics, though William Bateson, and separately Udny Yule, had already started to show how Mendelian genetics could work in evolution in 1902.

Different syntheses followed, including with social behaviour in E. O. Wilson&#x27;s sociobiology in 1975, evolutionary developmental biology&#x27;s integration of embryology with genetics and evolution, starting in 1977, and Massimo Pigliucci&#x27;s and Gerd B. Müller&#x27;s proposed extended evolutionary synthesis of 2007. In the view of evolutionary biologist Eugene Koonin in 2009, the modern synthesis will be replaced by a &#x27;post-modern&#x27; synthesis that will include revolutionary changes in molecular biology, the study of prokaryotes and the resulting tree of life, and genomics.

==Developments leading up to the synthesis==

===Darwin&#x27;s evolution by natural selection, 1859===

Charles Darwin&#x27;s 1859 book, &quot;On the Origin of Species,&quot; convinced most biologists that evolution had occurred, but not that natural selection was its primary mechanism. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, variations of Lamarckism (inheritance of acquired characteristics), orthogenesis (progressive evolution), saltationism (evolution by jumps) and mutationism (evolution driven by mutations) were discussed as alternatives. Darwin himself had sympathy for Lamarckism, but Alfred Russel Wallace advocated natural selection and totally rejected Lamarckism. In 1880, Samuel Butler labelled Wallace&#x27;s view neo-Darwinism.

===The eclipse of Darwinism, 1880s onwards===

From the 1880s onwards, biologists grew skeptical of Darwinian evolution. This eclipse of Darwinism (in Julian Huxley&#x27;s words) grew out of the weaknesses in Darwin&#x27;s account, with respect to his view of inheritance. Darwin believed in blending inheritance, which implied that any new variation, even if beneficial, would be weakened by 50% at each generation, as the engineer Fleeming Jenkin noted in 1868. This in turn meant that small variations would not survive long enough to be selected. Blending would therefore directly oppose natural selection. In addition, Darwin and others considered Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics entirely possible, and Darwin&#x27;s 1868 theory of pangenesis, with contributions to the next generation (gemmules) flowing from all parts of the body, actually implied Lamarckism as well as blending.

===Weismann&#x27;s germ plasm, 1892===

August Weismann&#x27;s idea, set out in his 1892 book &quot;Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung&quot; (&quot;The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance&quot;), was that the hereditary material, which he called the germ plasm, and the rest of the body (the soma) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. If correct, this made Darwin&#x27;s pangenesis wrong, and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails, demonstrated that inheritance was &#x27;hard&#x27;. He argued strongly and dogmatically for Darwinism and against Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists. This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to its eclipse.

==Disputed beginnings==

===Genetics, mutationism and biometrics, 1900–1918===

While carrying out breeding experiments to clarify the mechanism of inheritance in 1900, Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns independently rediscovered Gregor Mendel&#x27;s work. News of this reached William Bateson in England, who reported on the paper during a presentation to the Royal Horticultural Society in May 1900. In Mendelian inheritance, the contributions of each parent retain their integrity, rather than blending with the contribution of the other parent. In the case of a cross between two true-breeding varieties such as Mendel&#x27;s round and wrinkled peas, the first-generation offspring are all alike, in this case, all round. Allowing these to cross, the original characteristics reappear (segregation): about 3/4 of their offspring are round, 1/4 wrinkled. There is a discontinuity between the appearance of the offspring; de Vries coined the term allele for a variant form of an inherited characteristic. This reinforced a major division of thought, already present in the 1890s, between gradualists who followed Darwin, and saltationists such as Bateson.

The two schools were the Mendelians, such as Bateson and de Vries, who favoured mutationism, evolution driven by mutation, based on genes whose alleles segregated discretely like Mendel&#x27;s peas; and the biometric school, led by Karl Pearson and Walter Weldon. The biometricians argued vigorously against mutationism, saying that empirical evidence indicated that variation was continuous in most organisms, not discrete as Mendelism seemed to predict; they wrongly believed that Mendelism inevitably implied evolution in discontinuous jumps.

A traditional view is that the biometricians and the Mendelians rejected natural selection and argued for their separate theories for 20 years, the debate only resolved by the development of population genetics.
A more recent view is that Bateson, de Vries, Thomas Hunt Morgan and Reginald Punnett had by 1918 formed a synthesis of Mendelism and mutationism. The understanding achieved by these geneticists spanned the action of natural selection on alleles (alternative forms of a gene), the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the evolution of continuously varying traits (like height), and the probability that a new mutation will become fixed. In this view, the early geneticists accepted natural selection but rejected Darwin&#x27;s non-Mendelian ideas about variation and heredity, and the synthesis began soon after 1900. The traditional claim that Mendelians rejected the idea of continuous variation is false; as early as 1902, Bateson and Saunders wrote that &quot;If there were even so few as, say, four or five pairs of possible allelomorphs, the various homo- and heterozygous combinations might, on seriation, give so near an approach to a continuous curve, that the purity of the elements would be unsuspected&quot;. Also in 1902, the statistician Udny Yule showed mathematically that given multiple factors, Mendel&#x27;s theory enabled continuous variation. Yule criticised Bateson&#x27;s approach as confrontational, but failed to prevent the Mendelians and the biometricians from falling out.

===Castle&#x27;s hooded rats, 1911===

Starting in 1906, William Castle carried out a long study of the effect of selection on coat colour in rats. The piebald or hooded pattern was recessive to the grey wild type. He crossed hooded rats with both wild and &quot;Irish&quot; types, and then back-crossed the offspring with pure hooded rats. The dark stripe on the back was bigger. He then tried selecting different groups for bigger or smaller stripes for 5 generations and found that it was possible to change the characteristics considerably beyond the initial range of variation. This effectively refuted de Vries&#x27;s claim that continuous variation was caused by the environment and could not be inherited. By 1911, Castle noted that the results could be explained by Darwinian selection on a heritable variation of a sufficient number of Mendelian genes.

===Morgan&#x27;s fruit flies, 1912===
Thomas Hunt Morgan began his career in genetics as a saltationist and started out trying to demonstrate that mutations could produce new species in fruit flies. However, the experimental work at his lab with the fruit fly, &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; showed that rather than creating new species in a single step, mutations increased the supply of genetic variation in the population. By 1912, after years of work on the genetics of fruit flies, Morgan showed that these insects had many small Mendelian factors (discovered as mutant flies) on which Darwinian evolution could work as if the variation was fully continuous. The way was open for geneticists to conclude that Mendelism supported Darwinism.

==An obstruction: Woodger&#x27;s positivism, 1929==

The theoretical biologist and philosopher of biology Joseph Henry Woodger led the introduction of positivism into biology with his 1929 book &quot;Biological Principles&quot;. He saw a mature science as being characterised by a framework of hypotheses that could be verified by facts established by experiments. He criticised the traditional natural history style of biology, including the study of evolution, as immature science, since it relied on narrative. Woodger set out to play the role of Robert Boyle&#x27;s 1661 &quot;Sceptical Chymist&quot;, intending to convert the subject of biology into a formal, unified science, and ultimately, following the Vienna Circle of logical positivists like Otto Neurath and Rudolf Carnap, to reduce biology to physics and chemistry. His efforts stimulated the biologist J. B. S. Haldane to push for the axiomatisation of biology, and by influencing thinkers such as Huxley, helped to bring about the modern synthesis. The positivist climate made natural history unfashionable, and in America, research and university-level teaching on evolution declined almost to nothing by the late 1930s. The Harvard physiologist William John Crozier told his students that evolution was not even a science: &quot;You can&#x27;t experiment with two million years!&quot;

The tide of opinion turned with the adoption of mathematical modelling and controlled experimentation in population genetics, combining genetics, ecology and evolution in a framework acceptable to positivism.

==Elements of the synthesis==
===Fisher and Haldane&#x27;s mathematical population genetics, 1918–1930===
In 1918, R. A. Fisher wrote &quot;The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance,&quot; which showed how continuous variation could come from a number of discrete genetic loci. In this and other papers, culminating in his 1930 book &quot;The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection&quot;, Fisher showed how Mendelian genetics was consistent with the idea of evolution by natural selection.

In the 1920s, a series of papers by J. B. S. Haldane analyzed real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths. and showed that natural selection could work even faster than Fisher had assumed. Both of these scholars, and others, such as Dobzhansky and Wright, wanted to raise biology to the standards of the physical sciences by basing it on mathematical modeling and empirical testing. Natural selection, once considered unverifiable, was becoming predictable, measurable, and testable.

===De Beer&#x27;s embryology, 1930===

The traditional view is that developmental biology played little part in the modern synthesis, but in his 1930 book &quot;Embryos and Ancestors&quot;, the evolutionary embryologist Gavin de Beer anticipated evolutionary developmental biology by showing that evolution could occur by heterochrony, such as in the retention of juvenile features in the adult. This, de Beer argued, could cause apparently sudden changes in the fossil record, since embryos fossilise poorly. As the gaps in the fossil record had been used as an argument against Darwin&#x27;s gradualist evolution, de Beer&#x27;s explanation supported the Darwinian position.
However, despite de Beer, the modern synthesis largely ignored embryonic development when explaining the form of organisms, since population genetics appeared to be an adequate explanation of how such forms evolved.

===Wright&#x27;s adaptive landscape, 1932===

The population geneticist Sewall Wright focused on combinations of genes that interacted as complexes, and the effects of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations, which could be subject to genetic drift. In a 1932 paper, he introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which would in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks. Wright&#x27;s model appealed to field naturalists such as Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr who were becoming aware of the importance of geographical isolation in real world populations. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright helped to found the discipline of theoretical population genetics.

===Dobzhansky&#x27;s evolutionary genetics, 1937===

Theodosius Dobzhansky, an immigrant from the Soviet Union to the United States, who had been a postdoctoral worker in Morgan&#x27;s fruit fly lab, was one of the first to apply genetics to natural populations. He worked mostly with &quot;Drosophila pseudoobscura&quot;. He says pointedly: &quot;Russia has a variety of climates from the Arctic to sub-tropical... Exclusively laboratory workers who neither possess nor wish to have any knowledge of living beings in nature were and are in a minority.&quot; Not surprisingly, there were other Russian geneticists with similar ideas, though for some time their work was known to only a few in the West. His 1937 work &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; was a key step in bridging the gap between population geneticists and field naturalists. It presented the conclusions reached by Fisher, Haldane, and especially Wright in their highly mathematical papers in a form that was easily accessible to others. Further, Dobzhansky asserted the physicality, and hence the biological reality, of the mechanisms of inheritance: that evolution was based on material genes, arranged in a string on physical hereditary structures, the chromosomes, and linked more or less strongly to each other according to their actual physical distances on the chromosomes. As with Haldane and Fisher, Dobzhansky&#x27;s &quot;evolutionary genetics&quot; was a genuine science, now unifying cell biology, genetics, and both micro and macroevolution. His work emphasized that real-world populations had far more genetic variability than the early population geneticists had assumed in their models and that genetically distinct sub-populations were important. Dobzhansky argued that natural selection worked to maintain genetic diversity as well as by driving change. He was influenced by his exposure in the 1920s to the work of Sergei Chetverikov, who had looked at the role of recessive genes in maintaining a reservoir of genetic variability in a population, before his work was shut down by the rise of Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union. By 1937, Dobzhansky was able to argue that mutations were the main source of evolutionary changes and variability, along with chromosome rearrangements, effects of genes on their neighbours during development, and polyploidy. Next, genetic drift (he used the term in 1941), selection, migration, and geographical isolation could change gene frequencies. Thirdly, mechanisms like ecological or sexual isolation and hybrid sterility could fix the results of the earlier processes.

===Ford&#x27;s ecological genetics, 1940===

E. B. Ford was an experimental naturalist who wanted to test natural selection in nature, virtually inventing the field of ecological genetics. His work on natural selection in wild populations of butterflies and moths was the first to show that predictions made by R. A. Fisher were correct. In 1940, he was the first to describe and define genetic polymorphism, and to predict that human blood group polymorphisms might be maintained in the population by providing some protection against disease. His 1949 book &quot;Mendelism and Evolution&quot; helped to persuade Dobzhansky to change the emphasis in the third edition of his famous textbook &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; from drift to selection.

===Schmalhausen&#x27;s stabilizing selection, 1941===
Ivan Schmalhausen developed the theory of stabilizing selection, the idea that selection can preserve a trait at some value, publishing a paper in Russian titled &quot;Stabilizing selection and its place among factors of evolution&quot; in 1941 and a monograph &quot;Factors of Evolution: The Theory of Stabilizing Selection&quot; in 1945. He developed it from J. M. Baldwin&#x27;s 1902 concept that changes induced by the environment will ultimately be replaced by hereditary changes (including the Baldwin effect on behaviour), following that theory&#x27;s implications to their Darwinian conclusion, and bringing him into conflict with Lysenkoism. Schmalhausen observed that stabilizing selection would remove most variations from the norm, most mutations being harmful. Dobzhansky called the work &quot;an important missing link in the modern view of evolution&quot;.

===Huxley&#x27;s popularising synthesis, 1942===

In 1942, Julian Huxley&#x27;s serious but popularising book &quot;&quot; introduced a name for the synthesis and intentionally set out to promote a &quot;synthetic point of view&quot; on the evolutionary process. He imagined a wide synthesis of many sciences: genetics, developmental physiology, ecology, systematics, palaeontology, cytology, and mathematical analysis of biology, and assumed that evolution would proceed differently in different groups of organisms according to how their genetic material was organised and their strategies for reproduction, leading to progressive but varying evolutionary trends. His vision was of an &quot;evolutionary humanism&quot;, with a system of ethics and a meaningful place for &quot;Man&quot; in the world grounded in a unified theory of evolution which would demonstrate progress leading to humanity at its summit. Natural selection was in his view a &quot;fact of nature capable of verification by observation and experiment&quot;, while the &quot;period of synthesis&quot; of the 1920s and 1930s had formed a &quot;more unified science&quot;, rivalling physics and enabling the &quot;rebirth of Darwinism&quot;.

However, the book was not the research text that it appeared to be. In the view of the philosopher of science Michael Ruse, and in Huxley&#x27;s own opinion, Huxley was &quot;a generalist, a synthesizer of ideas, rather than a specialist&quot;. Ruse observes that Huxley wrote as if he were adding empirical evidence to the mathematical framework established by Fisher and the population geneticists, but that this was not so. Huxley avoided mathematics, for instance not even mentioning Fisher&#x27;s fundamental theorem of natural selection. Instead, Huxley used a mass of examples to demonstrate that natural selection is powerful and that it works on Mendelian genes. The book was successful in its goal of persuading readers of the reality of evolution, effectively illustrating topics such as island biogeography, speciation, and competition. Huxley further showed that the appearance of long-term orthogenetic trends – predictable directions for evolution – in the fossil record were readily explained as allometric growth (since parts are interconnected). All the same, Huxley did not reject orthogenesis out of hand, but maintained a belief in progress all his life, with &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; as the endpoint, and he had since 1912 been influenced by the vitalist philosopher Henri Bergson, though in public he maintained an atheistic position on evolution. Huxley&#x27;s belief in progress within evolution and evolutionary humanism was shared in various forms by Dobzhansky, Mayr, Simpson and Stebbins, all of them writing about &quot;the future of Mankind&quot;. Both Huxley and Dobzhansky admired the palaeontologist priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Huxley writing the introduction to Teilhard&#x27;s 1955 book on orthogenesis, &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot;. This vision required evolution to be seen as the central and guiding principle of biology.

===Mayr&#x27;s allopatric speciation, 1942===

Ernst Mayr&#x27;s key contribution to the synthesis was &quot;Systematics and the Origin of Species&quot;, published in 1942. It asserted the importance of and set out to explain population variation in evolutionary processes including speciation. He analysed in particular the effects of polytypic species, geographic variation, and isolation by geographic and other means. Mayr emphasized the importance of allopatric speciation, where geographically isolated sub-populations diverge so far that reproductive isolation occurs. He was skeptical of the reality of sympatric speciation believing that geographical isolation was a prerequisite for building up intrinsic (reproductive) isolating mechanisms. Mayr also introduced the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations. Before he left Germany for the United States in 1930, Mayr had been influenced by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch, who in the 1920s had analyzed the geographic distribution of polytypic species, paying particular attention to how variations between populations correlated with factors such as differences in climate.

===Simpson&#x27;s palaeontology, 1944===

George Gaylord Simpson was responsible for showing that the modern synthesis was compatible with palaeontology in his 1944 book &quot;Tempo and Mode in Evolution&quot;. Simpson&#x27;s work was crucial because so many palaeontologists had disagreed, in some cases vigorously, with the idea that natural selection was the main mechanism of evolution. It showed that the trends of linear progression (in for example the evolution of the horse) that earlier palaeontologists had used as support for neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis did not hold up under careful examination. Instead, the fossil record was consistent with the irregular, branching, and non-directional pattern predicted by the modern synthesis.

===Society for the Study of Evolution, 1946===

During World War II, Mayr edited a series of bulletins of the Committee on Common Problems of Genetics, Paleontology, and Systematics, formed in 1943, reporting on discussions of a &quot;synthetic attack&quot; on the interdisciplinary problems of evolution. In 1946, the committee became the Society for the Study of Evolution, with Mayr, Dobzhansky and Sewall Wright the first of the signatories. Mayr became the editor of its journal, &quot;Evolution&quot;. From Mayr and Dobzhansky&#x27;s point of view, suggests the historian of science Betty Smocovitis, Darwinism was reborn, evolutionary biology was legitimised, and genetics and evolution were synthesised into a newly unified science. Everything fitted into the new framework, except &quot;heretics&quot; like Richard Goldschmidt who annoyed Mayr and Dobzhansky by insisting on the possibility of speciation by macromutation, creating &quot;hopeful monsters&quot;. The result was &quot;bitter controversy&quot;.

===Stebbins&#x27;s botany, 1950===

The botanist G. Ledyard Stebbins extended the synthesis to encompass botany. He described the important effects on speciation of hybridization and polyploidy in plants in his 1950 book &quot;Variation and Evolution in Plants&quot;. These permitted evolution to proceed rapidly at times, polyploidy in particular evidently being able to create new species effectively instantaneously.

==Definitions by the founders ==

The modern synthesis was defined differently by its various founders, with differing numbers of basic postulates, as shown in the table.

==After the synthesis==

After the synthesis, evolutionary biology continued to develop with major contributions from workers including W. D. Hamilton, George C. Williams, E. O. Wilson, Edward B. Lewis and others.

===Hamilton&#x27;s inclusive fitness, 1964===
In 1964, W. D. Hamilton published two papers on &quot;The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour&quot;. These defined inclusive fitness as the number of offspring equivalents an individual rears, rescues or otherwise supports through its behaviour. This was contrasted with personal reproductive fitness, the number of offspring that the individual directly begets. Hamilton, and others such as John Maynard Smith, argued that a gene&#x27;s success consisted in maximising the number of copies of itself, either by begetting them or by indirectly encouraging begetting by related individuals who shared the gene, the theory of kin selection.

===Williams&#x27;s gene-centred evolution, 1966===
In 1966, George C. Williams published &quot;Adaptation and Natural Selection&quot;, outlined a gene-centred view of evolution following Hamilton&#x27;s concepts, disputing the idea of evolutionary progress, and attacking the then widespread theory of group selection. Williams argued that natural selection worked by changing the frequency of alleles, and could not work at the level of groups. Gene-centred evolution was popularised by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; and developed in his more technical writings.

===Wilson&#x27;s sociobiology, 1975===

In 1975, E. O. Wilson published his controversial book &quot;&quot;, the subtitle alluding to the modern synthesis as he attempted to bring the study of animal society into the evolutionary fold. This appeared radically new, although Wilson was following Darwin, Fisher, Dawkins and others. Critics such as Gerhard Lenski noted that he was following Huxley, Simpson and Dobzhansky&#x27;s approach, which Lenski considered needlessly reductive as far as human society was concerned. By 2000, the proposed discipline of sociobiology had morphed into the relatively well-accepted discipline of evolutionary psychology.

===Lewis&#x27;s homeotic genes, 1978===

In 1977, recombinant DNA technology enabled biologists to start to explore the genetic control of development. The growth of evolutionary developmental biology from 1978, when Edward B. Lewis discovered homeotic genes, showed that many so-called toolkit genes act to regulate development, influencing the expression of other genes. It also revealed that some of the regulatory genes are extremely ancient, so that animals as different as insects and mammals share control mechanisms; for example, the &quot;Pax6&quot; gene is involved in forming the eyes of mice and of fruit flies. Such deep homology provided strong evidence for evolution and indicated the paths that evolution had taken.

==Later syntheses==

In 1982, a historical note on a series of evolutionary biology books could state without qualification that evolution is the central organizing principle of biology. Smocovitis commented on this that &quot;What the architects of the synthesis had worked to construct had by 1982 become a matter of fact&quot;, adding in a footnote that &quot;the centrality of evolution had thus been rendered tacit knowledge, part of the received wisdom of the profession&quot;.

By the late 20th century, however, the modern synthesis was showing its age, and fresh syntheses to remedy its defects and fill in its gaps were proposed from different directions. These have included such diverse fields as the study of society, developmental biology, epigenetics, molecular biology, microbiology, genomics, symbiogenesis, and horizontal gene transfer. The physiologist Denis Noble argues that these additions render neo-Darwinism in the sense of the early 20th century&#x27;s modern synthesis &quot;at the least, incomplete as a theory of evolution&quot;, and one that has been falsified by later biological research.

Michael Rose and Todd Oakley note that evolutionary biology, formerly divided and &quot;Balkanized&quot;, has been brought together by genomics. It has in their view discarded at least five common assumptions from the modern synthesis, namely that the genome is always a well-organised set of genes; that each gene has a single function; that species are well adapted biochemically to their ecological niches; that species are the durable units of evolution, and all levels from organism to organ, cell and molecule within the species are characteristic of it; and that the design of every organism and cell is efficient. They argue that the &quot;new biology&quot; integrates genomics, bioinformatics, and evolutionary genetics into a general-purpose toolkit for a &quot;Postmodern Synthesis&quot;.

===Pigliucci&#x27;s extended evolutionary synthesis, 2007===
In 2007, more than half a century after the modern synthesis, Massimo Pigliucci called for an extended evolutionary synthesis to incorporate aspects of biology that had not been included or had not existed in the mid-20th century. It revisits the relative importance of different factors, challenges assumptions made in the modern synthesis, and adds new factors such as multilevel selection, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, niche construction, and evolvability.

===Koonin&#x27;s &#x27;post-modern&#x27; evolutionary synthesis, 2009===
In 2009, Darwin&#x27;s 200th anniversary, the &quot;Origin of Species&quot;″ 150th, and the 200th of Lamarck&#x27;s &quot;early evolutionary synthesis&quot;, &quot;Philosophie Zoologique&quot;, the evolutionary biologist Eugene Koonin stated that while &quot;the edifice of the [early 20th century] Modern Synthesis has crumbled, apparently, beyond repair&quot;, a new 21st-century synthesis could be glimpsed. Three interlocking revolutions had, he argued, taken place in evolutionary biology: molecular, microbiological, and genomic. The molecular revolution included the neutral theory, that most mutations are neutral and that negative selection happens more often than the positive form, and that all current life evolved from a single common ancestor. In microbiology, the synthesis has expanded to cover the prokaryotes, using ribosomal RNA to form a tree of life. Finally, genomics brought together the molecular and microbiological syntheses - in particular, horizontal gene transfer between bacteria shows that prokaryotes can freely share genes. Many of these points had already been made by other researchers such as Ulrich Kutschera and Karl J. Niklas.

===Towards a replacement synthesis===
Biologists, alongside scholars of the history and philosophy of biology, have continued to debate the need for, and possible nature of, a replacement synthesis. For example, in 2017 Philippe Huneman and Denis M. Walsh stated in their book &quot;Challenging the Modern Synthesis&quot; that numerous theorists had pointed out that the disciplines of embryological developmental theory, morphology, and ecology had been omitted. They noted that all such arguments amounted to a continuing desire to replace the modern synthesis with one that united &quot;all biological fields of research related to evolution, adaptation, and diversity in a single theoretical framework.&quot; They observed further that there are two groups of challenges to the way the modern synthesis viewed inheritance. The first is that other modes such as epigenetic inheritance, phenotypic plasticity, the Baldwin effect, and the maternal effect allow new characteristics to arise and be passed on and for the genes to catch up with the new adaptations later. The second is that all such mechanisms are part, not of an inheritance system, but a developmental system: the fundamental unit is not a discrete selfishly competing gene, but a collaborating system that works at all levels from genes and cells to organisms and cultures to guide evolution. The molecular biologist Sean B. Carroll has commented that had Huxley had access to evolutionary developmental biology, &quot;embryology would have been a cornerstone of his Modern Synthesis, and so evo-devo is today a key element of a more complete, expanded evolutionary synthesis.&quot;
== Historiography ==

Looking back at the conflicting accounts of the modern synthesis, the historian Betty Smocovitis notes in her 1996 book &quot;Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology&quot; that both historians and philosophers of biology have attempted to grasp its scientific meaning, but have found it &quot;a moving target&quot;; the only thing they agreed on was that it was a historical event. In her words

<text>William Moulton Marston (May 9, 1893 – May 2, 1947), also known by the pen name Charles Moulton (), was an American psychologist who, with his wife Elizabeth Holloway, invented an early prototype of the polygraph. He was also known as a self-help author and comic book writer who created the character Wonder Woman.

Two women, his wife Elizabeth Holloway Marston, and their polygamous life partner, Olive Byrne, greatly influenced Wonder Woman&#x27;s creation.

He was inducted into the Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Marston was born in the Cliftondale section of Saugus, Massachusetts, the son of Annie Dalton (née Moulton) and Frederick William Marston. Marston was educated at Harvard University, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and receiving his B.A. in 1915, an LL.B. in 1918, and a PhD in psychology in 1921. While a student at Harvard, Marston sold his first script, &quot;The Thief&quot;, to filmmaker Alice Guy-Blaché, who directed the film in 1913. After teaching at American University in Washington, D.C., and Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, Marston traveled to Universal Studios in California in 1929, where he spent a year as Director of Public Services and taught at the University of Southern California.

Marston had two children each with both his wife Elizabeth Holloway Marston and partner Olive Byrne. Elizabeth gave birth to a son, Pete, and a daughter, Olive Ann. Olive Byrne gave birth to two sons. Elizabeth supported the family financially while Olive Byrne stayed home to take care of all four children. Marjorie Wilkes Huntley was a third woman who occasionally lived with them, and who would go on to become office executive under H. G. Peter.

===Psychologist and inventor===
Marston was the creator of the systolic blood pressure test, which became one component of the modern polygraph invented by John Augustus Larson in Berkeley, California. Marston&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth Holloway Marston, suggested a connection between emotion and blood pressure to William, observing that, &quot;[w]hen she got mad or excited, her blood pressure seemed to climb&quot;.

Although Elizabeth is not listed as Marston&#x27;s collaborator in his early work, Lamb, Matte (1996), and others refer directly and indirectly to Elizabeth&#x27;s own work on her husband&#x27;s research. She also appears in a picture taken in his laboratory in the 1920s (reproduced by Marston, 1938).

Marston set out to commercialize Larson&#x27;s invention of the polygraph, when he subsequently embarked on a career in entertainment and comic book writing and appearing as a salesman in ads for Gillette Razors, using a polygraph motif. From his psychological work, Marston became convinced that women were more honest than men in certain situations and could work faster and more accurately. During his lifetime, Marston championed what he saw as the latent abilities and causes of the women of his day.

Marston was also a writer of essays in popular psychology. In 1928, he published a book entitled &quot;Emotions of Normal People,&quot; a defense of many sexual taboos, using much of Byrne&#x27;s original research she had done for her doctorate. He dedicated the work to her, Holloway, his mother, his aunt, and Huntley. It received almost no attention from the rest of the academic community other than a review, written by Byrne herself, under her alternate name Olive Richard in &quot;The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology&quot;.

&quot;Emotions of Normal People&quot; also elaborated on the DISC Theory. Marston viewed people behaving along two axis, with their attention being either passive or active, depending on the individual&#x27;s perception of his or her environment as either favorable or antagonistic. By placing the axis at right angles, four quadrants form, with each describing a behavioral pattern:
* Dominance produces activity in an antagonistic environment
* Inducement produces activity in a favorable environment
* Submission produces passivity in a favorable environment
* Compliance produces passivity in an antagonistic environment.

Marston posited that there is a masculine notion of freedom that is inherently anarchic and violent and an opposing feminine notion based on &quot;Love Allure&quot; that leads to an ideal state of submission to loving authority.

==Wonder Woman==
===Creation===
On October 25, 1940, an interview conducted by his partner Olive Byrne (under the pseudonym &quot;Olive Richard&quot;) was published in &quot;The Family Circle&quot; (titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Laugh at the Comics&quot;), in which Marston said that he saw &quot;great educational potential&quot; in comic books. (A follow-up article was published two years later in 1942.) The interview caught the attention of comics publisher Max Gaines, who hired Marston as an educational consultant for National Periodical Publications and All-American Publications, two of the companies that would later merge to form DC Comics.

In the early 1940s, the DC Comics line was dominated by superpower-endowed male characters such as the Green Lantern and Superman, as well as Batman, with his high-tech gadgets. According to the Fall 2001 issue of the Boston University alumni magazine, it was the idea of Marston&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth Holloway Marston, to create a female superhero. Marston recommended an idea for a new kind of superhero, one who would conquer not with fists or firepower, but with love. &quot;Fine,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;but make her a woman.&quot;

Marston introduced the idea to Max Gaines, co-founder with Jack Liebowitz of All-American Publications. Given the go-ahead, Marston developed Wonder Woman, basing her character on the unconventional, liberated, powerful modern women of his day. Marston&#x27;s pseudonym, Charles Moulton, combined his own and Gaines&#x27;s middle names.

In a 1943 issue of &quot;The American Scholar&quot;, Marston wrote: &quot;Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force, strength, and power. Not wanting to be girls, they don&#x27;t want to be tender, submissive, peace-loving as good women are. Women&#x27;s strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness. The obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman.&quot;

In 2017, a majority of Marston&#x27;s personal papers arrived at the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University; this collection helps to tell the backstory of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, including his unorthodox personal life with two idealistic and strong women, Olive Byrne and Elizabeth Marston, with a connection to Margaret Sanger, one of the most influential feminists of the twentieth century.

===Development===
Marston&#x27;s character was a native of an all-female utopia of Amazons who became a crime-fighting U.S. government agent, using her superhuman strength and agility, and her ability to force villains to submit and tell the truth by binding them with her magic lasso. Her appearance was believed by some to be based somewhat on Olive Byrne, and her heavy bronze bracelets (which she used to deflect bullets) were inspired by bracelets worn by Byrne.

After her name &quot;Suprema, the Wonder Woman&quot; was replaced with simply &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, which was a popular term at the time that described women who were exceptionally gifted, the character made her debut in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #8 in December 1941. Wonder Woman next appeared in &quot;Sensation Comics&quot; #1 (January 1942), and six months later, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #1 debuted. Except for four months in 1986, the series has been in print ever since. The stories were initially written by Marston and illustrated by newspaper artist Harry Peter. During his life Marston had written many articles and books on various psychological topics, but his last six years of writing were devoted to his comics creation.

==Death==
William Moulton Marston died of cancer on May 2, 1947, in Rye, seven days before his 54th birthday. After his death, Elizabeth and Olive continued to live together until Olive&#x27;s death in 1990, aged 86; Elizabeth died in 1993, aged 100.

==Legacy==
In 1985, Marston was posthumously named as one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;. His contributions to the development of the polygraph are featured in the documentary film &quot;The Lie Detector&quot; which first aired on &quot;American Experience&quot; on January 3, 2023.

===Themes===
William Moulton Marston&#x27;s philosophy of diametric opposites has bled into the design of his Wonder Woman mythology. This theme of diametrics took the form of his emphasis of particular masculine and feminine configurations as well as dominance and submission.

Marston&#x27;s &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; is an early example of bondage themes that were entering popular culture in the 1930s. Physical and mental submission appears again and again throughout Marston&#x27;s comics work, with Wonder Woman and her criminal opponents frequently being tied up (or otherwise restrained), and her Amazonian sisters engaging in frequent wrestling and bondage play. These elements were softened by later writers of the series, who dropped such characters as the Nazi-like blonde female slaver Eviless completely, despite her having formed the original Villainy Inc. of Wonder Woman&#x27;s enemies (in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #28, the last by Marston).

Though Marston had described female nature as being more capable of submission emotion, in his other writings and interviews, he referred to submission as a noble practice. He did not shy away from the sexual implications, saying:

One of the purposes of these bondage depictions was to induce eroticism in readers as a part of what he called &quot;sex love training.&quot; Through his Wonder Woman comics, he aimed to condition readers to become more readily accepting of loving submission to loving authorities rather than being so assertive with their own destructive egos. About male readers, he later wrote: &quot;Give them an alluring woman stronger than themselves to submit to, and they&#x27;ll be proud to become her willing slaves!&quot;

Marston combined these themes with others, including restorative and transformative justice, rehabilitation, regret, and their roles in civilization. These appeared often in his depiction of the near-ideal Amazon civilization of Paradise Island, and especially its &quot;Reform Island&quot; penal colony, which played a central role in many stories and was the &quot;loving&quot; alternative to retributive justice of the world run by men. These themes are particularly evident in his last story, in which prisoners freed by Eviless, who have responded to Amazonian rehabilitation and now have good dominance/submission, stop her and restore the Amazons to power.

Some of these themes continued on in Silver Age characters, who may have been influenced by Marston, notably Saturn Girl and Saturn Queen, who (like Eviless and her female army) are also from Saturn, are also clad in tight, dark red bodysuits, are also blond or red-haired, and also have telepathic powers.

Wonder Woman&#x27;s golden Lasso of Truth and in particular one of the Amazon queens&#x27; scions of the Girdle of Aphrodite or Venus which Marston first fictionally encountered as Wonder Woman&#x27;s &#x27;Magic Girdle of Aphrodite&#x27; then reaching back to its origin called her Golden Girdle of Gaea, were the focus of many of the early stories and have the same capability to reform people for good in the short term that Transformation Island and prolonged wearing of Venus Girdles offered in the longer term. The Venus Girdle was an allegory for Marston&#x27;s theory of &quot;sex love&quot; training, where people can be &quot;trained&quot; to embrace submission through eroticism.

==In film==
Marston&#x27;s life is depicted in &quot;Professor Marston and the Wonder Women&quot;, a 2017 biographical drama also portraying Elizabeth Holloway Marston, Olive Byrne, and the creation of Wonder Woman. Marston is portrayed in the film by Welsh actor Luke Evans.

<doc id="97548" wikidata="Q33622" url="?curid=97548" title="Istro-Romanian language">
<text>The Istro-Romanian language () is an Eastern Romance language, spoken in a few villages and hamlets in the peninsula of Istria in Croatia, as well as in the diaspora of this people. It is sometimes abbreviated to IR.

While its speakers call themselves &quot;Rumeri&quot;, &quot;Rumeni&quot;, they are also known as &quot;Vlachs&quot;, &quot;Rumunski&quot;, &quot;Ćići&quot; and &quot;Ćiribiri&quot;. The last one, used by ethnic Croats, originated as a disparaging nickname for the language, rather than its speakers.

Due to the fact that its speakers are estimated to be fewer than 500, it is listed among languages that are &quot;severely endangered&quot; in the UNESCO &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot;.

It is also considered by some Romanian scholars to be an idiosyncratic offshoot dialect of Romanian.

==Recent history==
The Istro-Romanians have faced many significant challenges in preserving their language, culture and ethnic identity, including emigration from communism and migration to nearby cities and towns after World War II, when a peace treaty of February 10, 1947, transferred Istria from Italy (which had held it since World War I) and awarded it to Yugoslavia, the parent country of present-day Croatia and Slovenia, which divided Istria between themselves, while Italy still retained a small portion near Trieste.

Before the 20th century, Istro-Romanian was spoken in a substantially broader part of northeastern Istria surrounding the Ćićarija mountain range (ancient &quot;Mons Carusadius&quot;). The Istro-Romanians now comprise two groups: the &quot;Ćići&quot; around Žejane (denoting the people on the north side of Mt. Učka) and the &quot;Vlahi&quot; around Šušnjevica (denoting the people on the south side of Mt. Učka (Monte Maggiore). However, apart from borrowings from other languages which vary from village to village, their language is linguistically identical.

Several hundred native speakers live in the United States—not only in Queens, New York (as has been mistakenly believed by some), but throughout the five boroughs of New York City, as well as in upstate New York and the neighboring states of New Jersey and Connecticut. Native speakers also still live in California. Further groups of native speakers reside in Italy, Canada, Sweden and Australia.

The number of Istro-Romanian speakers has been reduced by their assimilation into other linguistic groups that were either already present or introduced by their respective new rulers of Istria: in the 1921 Italian census, there were 1,644 declared Istro-Romanian speakers in the area, while in 1926, Romanian scholar Sextil Pușcariu estimated their number to be closer to 3,000. Studies conducted in Istria in 1998 (?) by the Croatian linguist August Kovačec revealed only 170 active speakers (but those counted presumably are only those still in villages where the language is actively spoken, thereby excluding those who moved to larger towns in Istria), most of them being bilingual (or trilingual), except for 27 children.

On the other hand, the major northern village Žejane and nearby hamlets at the Slovenian border are less Italianized and more Slavicized. Many villages in the area have names that are of Romanian origin, such as &quot;Jeian&quot;, &quot;Buzet&quot; (&quot;lips&quot;), &quot;Katun&quot; (&quot;hamlet&quot;), &quot;Letaj&quot;, &quot;Sucodru&quot; (&quot;under a forest&quot;), &quot;Costirceanu&quot; (a Romanian name). Some of these names are official (recognized by Croatia as their only names), while others are used only by Istro-Romanian speakers (ex. Nova Vas|Noselo).

==Origin==
Some loanwords suggest that before coming to Istria, Istro-Romanians lived for a period of time on the Dalmatian coast near the Dinara and Velebit mountains.

August Kovačec (1998) hypothesizes that the Istro-Romanians migrated to their present region about 600 years ago from the territory of present-day Romania, after the bubonic plague depopulated Istria. This hypothesis is based on chronicles of the Frankopan princes that state that in the 15th century they accepted the migrating Vlachs from the nearby mainland and from the northern part of Krk (Veglia) island, and settled them in isolated villages in Poljica and Dubašnica, between the castles of Dobrinj and Omišalj, and in the port of Malinska. The term &quot;Vlach&quot;, however, refers to all Eastern-Romance-language speakers and cannot be associated exclusively with Istro-Romanians. In fact, pockets of Romanian-language speakers persisted in Malinska up to the mid-19th century, they gradually assimilated and their language disappeared with the last speaker, Mate Bajčić Gašparović. Today, few Romance-language toponyms remain in Malinska.

==Lexis==
Although it is a Romance language, Istro-Romanian has received a great amount of influence from other languages. According to a 2005 analysis, 50% of the words in Istro-Romanian come from Serbo-Croatian, 16% come from either Serbo-Croatian or Slovene, 3% come from Slovene, 4.7% come from Italian/Venetian, 3.5% come from Old Church Slavonic and only 25% come from Latin.

Another study made in 2009 found that 647 words are inherited from Latin (compared to about 2,000 words inherited from Latin in most Romance languages), and 25 words are from the substrate, a much smaller number compared to Daco-Romanian which preserved 89 words from the substrate. The situation is typical for isolated languages/dialects with lower number of speakers. Even so, Istro-Romanian has managed to preserve a few words from Latin that are not found in other Eastern Romance languages: &quot;gåbu&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; (&lt;galbus; also present in Romanian as &quot;galben&quot;), &quot;ånča&quot; &quot;here&quot; (&lt;hac‑ce), &quot;oča&quot; (&lt;hac/hocce+a), &quot;iențå&quot; (&lt; *hic‑ce+a), &quot;iuva&quot; &quot;where&quot;.

<doc id="97550" wikidata="Q1032319" url="?curid=97550" title="Beckenham (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Beckenham () was a constituency in Greater London represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament from 2010 until its abolition for the 2024 general election by Bob Stewart, a member of the Conservative Party.

Under the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the majority of the constituency was incorporated into the new constituency of [[Beckenham and Penge (UK Parliament constituency)|Beckenham and Penge]].

==Constituency profile==
The constituency is mostly leafy and suburban — one widely known gazetteer summarised this in 2012: There are significant areas of open land to the south around Hayes and Keston. The upmarket town centre of Beckenham is split between this constituency and Lewisham West and Penge to the west.

All wards have voted between 60 and 70% Conservative since the seat&#x27;s inception. In times when Labour has led in the national polls the seat has remained Conservative. The smallest majority in a general election was 9.3%, in 1997; in all other elections except 2001 there have been majorities of more than 15%. The seat happened to become safer in its cut down to six wards (from ten) in 2010. This removed the three most Labour inclined wards of the borough, centered on Penge, and one other, taken from the more suburban parts that lean strongly or weakly Conservative.

Since 1983 there has been a close contest for second place between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Labour&#x27;s share has remained much greater than in Orpington whereas the Liberal Democrat share has remained much greater than in Croydon Central.

==History==

The constituency has only elected Conservatives as its MPs since 1950.

The constituency shared boundaries with the Beckenham electoral division for election of councillors to the Greater London Council at elections in 1973, 1977 and 1981.

The closest the Conservatives have ever come to losing this seat was at a by-election in November 1997, at the height of Tony Blair&#x27;s &#x27;honeymoon period&#x27; as Prime Minister, following the resignation of the previous MP Piers Merchant in a sex scandal. Even then, the former MP for Hastings who lost her seat in the earlier 1997 general election, Jacqui Lait, managed to win the seat by just over 1,000 votes.

Between 1957 and 1992 the long-serving MP for Beckenham was Sir Philip Goodhart, who was soon after 1979 discovered by Margaret Thatcher to be a right-of-centre or &#x27;wet conservative&#x27; and consequently his career as a junior minister came to a quick end. Goodhart is best known for his book on the workings of the Conservative MPs&#x27; 1922 Committee, and for his brother Charles, who was a famous economics professor at LSE and sat for some time on the Bank of England&#x27;s monetary policy committee.

Before Sir Philip Goodhart, the former Conservative Chief Whip Patrick Buchan-Hepburn represented Beckenham in Parliament.

==Boundaries==

1950–1974: The Municipal Borough of Beckenham, and the Urban District of Penge.

1974–1983: The London Borough of Bromley wards of Anerley, Clock House, Copers Cope, Eden Park, Lawrie Park and Kent House, Manor House, Penge, and Shortlands.

1983–1997: The London Borough of Bromley wards of Anerley, Clock House, Copers Cope, Eden Park, Kelsey Park, Lawrie Park and Kent House, Penge, and Shortlands.

1997–2010: The London Borough of Bromley wards of Anerley, Clock House, Copers Cope, Eden Park, Kelsey Park, Lawrie Park and Kent House, Penge, Shortlands, West Wickham North, and West Wickham South.

2010–2024: The London Borough of Bromley wards of Bromley Common and Keston, Copers Cope, Hayes and Coney Hall, Kelsey and Eden Park, Shortlands, and West Wickham.

Despite the changes in ward names, the 1974–1983 boundaries and the 1983–1997 boundaries are almost exactly the same boundaries. Similarly, despite the changes in local authorities and the listing of wards, the 1950–1974 boundaries and the 1997–2010 boundaries are almost exactly the same.

Beckenham constituency covers the northwestern part of the London Borough of Bromley. The local government ward boundaries were redrawn for the 2002 local elections, though this did not affect parliamentary limits until the 2010 general election.

===Pre-2010 boundary review===
Following their review of parliamentary representation in South London, the Boundary Commission for England made revisions to this seat. Clock House ward, Crystal Palace ward, and Penge and Cator ward were transferred from Beckenham to help create the new constituency of Lewisham West and Penge. Parts of Bromley Common and Keston, Hayes and Coney Hall, and Shortlands wards were transferred to Beckenham from Bromley and Chislehurst. A small part of Bromley Common and Keston ward was transferred to Beckenham from Orpington and a tiny part of Bromley Town ward was transferred from Beckenham to Bromley and Chislehurst.

=== Abolition ===
Under the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the constituency underwent major boundary changes, with eastern areas, comprising the Bromley Common and Keston, and Hayes and Coney Hall wards, being transferred to the new constituency of Bromley and Biggin Hill. To compensate, &quot;Penge&quot; (comprising the Clock House, Crystal Palace, and Penge and Cator wards) was transferred back from the now abolished seat of Lewisham West and Penge. Accordingly, the seat was renamed Beckenham and Penge, first contested at the 2024 general election. With the new boundary changes it was notionally a marginal seat but was won by Liam Conlon for Labour with a majority of 12,905.

<doc id="97561" wikidata="Q231182" url="?curid=97561" title="Kelly Osbourne">
<text>Kelly Michelle Lee Osbourne (born 27 October 1984) is an English television personality, singer, actress, and fashion designer. She is a daughter of Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, and came to prominence while appearing on the reality show &quot;The Osbournes&quot; (2002–2005) with her family, for which they won a 2002 Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program. Her other television work includes hosting &quot;Project Catwalk&quot; (2007–2008) and &quot;Fashion Police&quot; (2010–2015), competing on the ninth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (2009), and judging on &quot;Project Runway Junior&quot; (2015–2017) and &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (2016). She also played the voice role of Hildy Gloom in the Disney XD animated series &quot;The 7D&quot; (2014–2016). 

As a singer, Osbourne has released two studio albums: &quot;Shut Up&quot; (2002) and &quot;Sleeping in the Nothing&quot; (2005). In 2003, she collaborated with her father Ozzy on the single &quot;Changes&quot; (a Black Sabbath song) which reached number one on the UK Singles Chart.

==Early life==
Osbourne was born at Portland Hospital in Westminster, London. She has an older sister, Aimee, and a younger brother, Jack. From Ozzy&#x27;s first marriage, she also has two half-siblings: Jessica Hobbs and Louis John Osbourne. She had an unofficially &quot;adopted&quot; brother, Robert Marcato, whom Sharon and Ozzy took in after Marcato&#x27;s mother died. Kelly grew up travelling with her father as he went on tour, and lived in more than 20 homes, mostly in the US, as well as in the UK. Her maternal grandfather was Don Arden (Harry Levy), an English music manager. Her mother is of Irish and Jewish descent.

Osbourne attended private schools in England including Pipers Corner School.

==Career==
===2002–2005: &quot;The Osbournes&quot; and &quot;Shut Up&quot;===
Osbourne and the rest of her family (without Aimee) starred on the MTV reality show &quot;The Osbournes&quot;, which aired from 2002 to 2005. The series chronicled their day-to-day life, portraying a dysfunctional family in which metal music, profanity and other harshness were a daily part of life. Kelly, the middle child, emerged (according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;) as &quot;a wickedly funny, brutally honest, pint-size, potty-mouthed spitfire.&quot; The series started when she was seventeen, and ended when she was twenty. Kelly said in an interview for &quot;The Osbournes&quot; DVD that the crew were only actually supposed to be there for a few weeks but ended up staying for a few months and that the constant cameras focusing on her and her family was stressful. In 2002, during the second season of &quot;The Osbournes&quot;, Kelly dated The Used lead singer Bert McCracken. The show was filmed in California, US. where the family has had their residence for several decades.

Both she and the Osbourne family were parodied in Channel 4 comedy &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta&quot; in which the rubber-masked Kelly, played by Leigh Francis, has her own show and is always being censored for swearing with bleeps.

After her appearance on the reality show, Osbourne quickly began to be noted for her varied and trendy style among fashion commentators like Steven Cojocaru. In 2004, Osbourne launched her own fashion line, Stiletto Killers, with her friend and former sponsor, Ali Barone. Stiletto Killers was a rock-inspired line of tees, knickers, hoodies and sweatpants designed by Osbourne and Barone, emblazoned with cartoonish designs and punk rock phrases. There was also a more sophisticated couture branch, the SK Collection. Stiletto Killers closed in April 2006.

Her debut album, &quot;Shut Up&quot;, was released by Epic Records in 2002 to moderate US sales, but good European sales. The lead single, a cover of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;, debuted with Houston rock band Pure Rubbish at the 2002 MTV Film Awards. The album, which debuted at No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Heatseekers chart, was met with mixed critical reviews and, by May 2003, Osbourne was dropped from Epic Records. By autumn she was on the Sanctuary label, later recording a duet of &quot;Changes&quot; (a Black Sabbath song) with her father. The duet hit No. 1 on the UK charts and resulted in a reissue of &quot;Shut Up&quot;, titled &quot;Changes&quot;. &quot;Changes&quot; was one of a few tracks to have fallen down the charts (from 1–3) while selling more copies than the week it reached number 1. Osbourne was the first artists to top all three of the Billboard charts dance surveys in the same week with the &quot;Chris Cox Club Remix&quot; of &quot;One Word&quot;. Her second album &quot;Sleeping in the Nothing&quot; was not without controversy, due to its reportedly heavily altered album cover, in which Osbourne appeared slimmer, despite her previous assertions of being happy with her size.

Osbourne made her debut as an actress with a starring role on 7 October 2004 on the ABC high school teenage drama &quot;Life as We Know It&quot;, where she played the supporting role of Deborah Beatrice Tynan. During an interview in late 2005, Osbourne denied reports she was ending her music career, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t know where the quit rumours came from – I&#x27;ve just recorded a version of &#x27;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&#x27; with Cyndi Lauper.&quot;

On 2 April 2004, Osbourne entered the Malibu rehab facility Promises after admitting to her family that she was addicted to painkillers. Over a year later, on 2 June, she checked into Las Encinas Hospital, a drug treatment centre in Pasadena, California, after a relapse. She entered another drug treatment facility in January 2009; she stayed for a month and later acknowledged that she had a relapse of her addiction to painkillers. After 30 days, she was released; she has been quoted as saying that this was the first time she really thought rehab had helped her.

===2006–2009: Acting, hosting duties, and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;===
In spring 2006, Osbourne modelled for Heatherette in a catwalk show. In June, she played the role of Wendy from Peter Pan in &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Handbag&quot; and provided her voice for the animated film &quot;Live Freaky Die Freaky&quot;. Later that year, she became the face of the high street chain Accessorize. Osbourne co-hosted the 2006 edition of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! NOW!&quot;, a spin-off show of the main ITV programme. She hosted alongside Jeff Brazier in Australia, and Mark Durden-Smith in the London studio. Her one-off gigs include the 2002 MTV Film Awards, &quot;Top of the Pops Saturday&quot;, MTV&#x27;s &quot;Isle of MTV&quot;, MTV UK and Ireland&#x27;s red carpet coverage of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, &quot;Popworld&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Night Project&quot;, the 2005 MTV Australia Video Music Awards and Zane Lowe&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show. In spring 2006, Osbourne was one of the judges on &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot;. At the September 2006 Electric Picnic festival in Ireland, Osbourne and her boyfriend, Matty Derham of the band Fields, held a wedding ceremony. Her representative later denied that the ceremony was legally binding because it did not meet Irish legal requirements, as at that time in Ireland, a couple couldn&#x27;t get married in an outdoor venue. She later went on to date Matt Walker, a promoter and tour manager.

In February 2006, Osbourne was a guest judge for the Season One Episode Four of &quot;Project Catwalk&quot; on Sky1. She went on to host Seasons Two and Three of &quot;Project Catwalk&quot; in 2007 and 2008 respectively. In July 2007, Osbourne portrayed the role of prison matron Mama Morton in the musical drama &quot;Chicago&quot; for seven weeks at the Cambridge Theatre. In autumn 2007, Osbourne signed to BBC Radio 1 to host the Sunday night show, &quot;The Surgery&quot;; and on 7 October 2007, she went on air for the first time with the issue of self-harm. She was scheduled to return to the show in early 2009 and while she was away, Aled Haydn Jones from &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; presented the show. Aled subsequently became the full-time presenter. In 2008, she featured in the short musical film &quot;The Town that Boars Me&quot; by photographer Ben Charles Edwards. The film also features Sadie Frost, Jodie Harsh, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and Zandra Rhodes, among others. The film debuted in late summer at the Portobello Film Festival. In 2009, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot;, a British TV show aired on BBC One. She played Jo, a character very similar to herself.

On 19 January 2009, Osbourne was arrested for assault after allegedly slapping &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; columnist Zoe Griffin at a club in August 2008 after Griffin wrote a story that mocked Osbourne&#x27;s then-boyfriend, Luke Worrall. In March 2009, Osbourne and Worrall were engaged, but later separated in July 2010 after he had an affair with model Elle Schneider. Osbourne presented ITV2&#x27;s coverage of the National Television Awards with her brother Jack, and a documentary on Japanese pop culture called &quot;Kelly Osbourne: Turning Japanese&quot; for the same channel. In March 2009, Osbourne returned to television with the rest of the Osbourne family on &quot;&quot;. On 1 September 2009, Osbourne released her first autobiography, &quot;Fierce&quot;, via Virgin Books. The book contains autobiographical elements, as well as advice and guidance through tough periods.

In September 2009, she started writing a weekly column giving advice and celebrity gossip in the British magazine &quot;Closer&quot;.

On 17 August 2009, co-hosts Tom Bergeron and Samantha Harris announced the cast of stars for the 2009 autumn series of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Osbourne was to be one of the 16 celebrity contestants. A week later, her professional partner was announced: Dutch ballroom champion Louis van Amstel. The competition, starting 21 September 2009, entailed 10 weeks of training and dancing. On 17 November 2009, the final three were announced: Osbourne, singer Mýa and pop legend Donny Osmond. In the final, Osbourne and her partner placed third.

In August 2010, Osbourne began filming on the comedy &quot;Should&#x27;ve Been Romeo&quot;, her first major role in Hollywood. She plays Nicole, a fun-loving groupie. The film was released in the US on 28 April 2012. In December 2010, it was confirmed that Osbourne would be starring alongside Disney star Miley Cyrus in &quot;So Undercover&quot;, playing a sorority sister of Cyrus&#x27;. Filming began in December 2010 and was released on 6 December 2012.

In 2010, she modelled a Chris Benz dress for Naomi Campbell&#x27;s Fashion For Relief runway show for the White Ribbon Alliance to raise funds for mothers in Haiti.

In September 2012, US rapper Lil&#x27; Kim confirmed she and Osbourne were to join forces for a rock-rap cover of Elton John&#x27;s 1974 hit &quot;The Bitch Is Back&quot;. In 2013, Osbourne walked the runway for The Heart Truth Red Dress Fashion Show.

On 7 March 2013, while filming an episode of &quot;Fashion Police&quot; with guest Melissa Rivers, Osbourne collapsed and began experiencing a seizure that reportedly lasted thirty seconds, after which she was taken to a local Los Angeles hospital for testing.

In August 2013, Osbourne was a guest judge on the 12th season of &quot;Project Runway&quot;. She was a guest judge on the October 2014 premiere episode of &quot;Project Runway: Threads&quot;. She is a regular judge on &quot;Project Runway: Junior&quot;.

In February 2015, Osbourne exited &quot;Fashion Police&quot; after complaints about her co-host&#x27;s comments on the show.

In August 2015, Osbourne garnered controversy while discussing Donald Trump&#x27;s immigration policy on &quot;The View&quot;. Osbourne said, to backlash from the show&#x27;s co-hosts, &quot;If you kick every Latino out of this country, then who is going to be cleaning your toilet, Donald Trump?” Osbourne soon backtracked on this statement, which was widely condemned as racist, and later apologised on Twitter. Her comments on the show later became a widespread TikTok meme in 2024, prompting Osbourne to recall the incident in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;the most cringe moment of [her] entire life&quot; and &quot;the worst thing [she&#x27;s] ever done.&quot;

On 28 October 2015, it was confirmed that Osbourne would replace Dawn French as a judge on &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; for its eighth season on Channel Nine.

<text>Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10 ), also known as ubiquinone, is a naturally occurring biochemical cofactor (coenzyme) and an antioxidant produced by the human body. It can also be obtained from dietary sources, such as meat, fish, seed oils, vegetables, and dietary supplements. CoQ10 is found in many organisms, including animals and bacteria.

CoQ10 plays a role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, aiding in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is involved in energy transfer within cells. The structure of CoQ10 consists of a benzoquinone moiety and an isoprenoid side chain, with the &quot;10&quot; referring to the number of isoprenyl chemical subunits in its tail.

Although a ubiquitous molecule in human tissues, CoQ10 is not a dietary nutrient and does not have a recommended intake level, and its use as a supplement is not approved in the United States for any health or anti-disease effect.

==Biological functions==

CoQ10 is a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), where it plays a role in oxidative phosphorylation, a process required for the biosynthesis of adenosine triphosphate, the primary energy source of cells.

CoQ10 is a lipophilic molecule that is located in all biological membranes of human body and serves as a component for the synthesis of ATP and is a life-sustaining cofactor for the three complexes (complex I, complex II, and complex III) of the ETC in the mitochondria. CoQ10 has a role in the transport of protons across lysosomal membranes to regulate pH in lysosome functions.

The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation process occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotic cells. This membrane is highly folded into structures called cristae, which increase the surface area available for oxidative phosphorylation. CoQ10 plays a role in this process as an essential cofactor of the ETC located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and serves the following functions:
* electron transport in the mitochondrial ETC, by shuttling electrons from mitochondrial complexes like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), ubiquinone reductase (complex I), and succinate ubiquinone reductase (complex II), the fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids oxidation (through flavin-linked dehydrogenases) to ubiquinol–cytochrome-c reductase (complex III) of the ETC: CoQ10 participates in fatty acid and glucose metabolism by transferring electrons generated from the reduction of fatty acids and glucose to electron acceptors;
* antioxidant activity as a lipid-soluble antioxidant together with vitamin E, scavenging reactive oxygen species and protecting cells against oxidative stress, inhibiting the oxidation of proteins, DNA, and use of vitamin E.

==Biochemistry==

Coenzymes Q is a coenzyme family that is ubiquitous in animals and many Pseudomonadota, a group of gram-negative bacteria. The fact that the coenzyme is ubiquitous gives the origin of its other name, ubiquinone. In humans, the most common form of coenzymes Q is coenzyme Q10, also called CoQ10 () or ubiquinone-10.

Coenzyme Q10 is a 1,4-benzoquinone, in which &quot;Q&quot; refers to the quinone chemical group and &quot;10&quot; refers to the number of isoprenyl chemical subunits (shown enclosed in brackets in the diagram) in its tail. In natural ubiquinones, there are from six to ten subunits in the tail, with humans having a tail of 10 isoprene units (50 carbon atoms) connected to its benzoquinone &quot;head&quot;.

This family of fat-soluble substances is present in all respiring eukaryotic cells, primarily in the mitochondria. Ninety-five percent of the human body&#x27;s energy is generated this way. Organs with the highest energy requirements—such as the heart, liver, and kidney—have the highest CoQ10 concentrations.

There are three redox states of CoQ: fully oxidized (&quot;ubi&quot;quinone), &quot;semi&quot;quinone (&quot;ubisemi&quot;quinone), and fully reduced (ubiquinol). The capacity of this molecule to act as a two-electron carrier (moving between the quinone and quinol form) and a one-electron carrier (moving between the semiquinone and one of these other forms) is central to its role in the electron transport chain due to the iron–sulfur clusters that can only accept one electron at a time and as a free radical–scavenging antioxidant.

==Deficiency==
There are two major pathways of deficiency of CoQ10 in humans: reduced biosynthesis, and increased use by the body. Biosynthesis is the major source of CoQ10. Biosynthesis requires at least 15 genes, and mutations in any of them can cause CoQ deficiency. CoQ10 levels also may be affected by other genetic defects (such as mutations of mitochondrial DNA, &quot;ETFDH&quot;, &quot;APTX&quot;, &quot;FXN&quot;, and &quot;BRAF&quot;, genes that are not directly related to the CoQ10 biosynthetic process). Some of these, such as mutations in &quot;COQ6&quot;, can lead to serious diseases such as steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome with sensorineural deafness.

===Assessment===
Although CoQ10 may be measured in blood plasma, these measurements reflect dietary intake rather than tissue status. Currently, most clinical centers measure CoQ10 levels in cultured skin fibroblasts, muscle biopsies, and blood mononuclear cells. Culture fibroblasts can be used also to evaluate the rate of endogenous CoQ10 biosynthesis, by measuring the uptake of 14C-labeled &quot;p&quot;-hydroxybenzoate.
CoQ10 is studied as an adjunctive therapy to reduce inflammation in periodontitis.

===Statins===
Although statins may reduce CoQ10 in the blood it is unclear if they reduce CoQ10 in muscle. Evidence does not support that supplementation improves statin side effects.

==Chemical properties==
The oxidized structure of CoQ10 is shown below. The various kinds of coenzyme Q may be distinguished by the number of isoprenoid subunits in their side-chains. The most common coenzyme Q in human mitochondria is CoQ10. Q refers to the quinone head and &quot;10&quot; refers to the number of isoprene repeats in the tail. The molecule below has three isoprenoid units and would be called Q3.

In its pure state, it is an orange-colored lipophile powder and has no taste or odor.

==Biosynthesis==
Biosynthesis occurs in most human tissue. There are three major steps:
# Creation of the benzoquinone structure (using phenylalanine or tyrosine, via 4-hydroxybenzoate)
# Creation of the isoprene side chain (using acetyl-CoA)
# The joining or condensation of the above two structures

The initial two reactions occur in mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes, indicating multiple sites of synthesis in animal cells.

An important enzyme in this pathway is HMG-CoA reductase, usually a target for intervention in cardiovascular complications. The &quot;statin&quot; family of cholesterol-reducing medications inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. One possible side effect of statins is decreased production of CoQ10, which may be connected to the development of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. However, the role statins play in CoQ deficiency is controversial. Although statins reduce blood levels of CoQ, studies on the effects of muscle levels of CoQ are yet to come. CoQ supplementation also does not reduce side effects of statin medications.

Genes involved include &quot;PDSS1&quot;, &quot;PDSS2&quot;, &quot;COQ2&quot;, and &quot;ADCK3&quot; (&quot;COQ8&quot;, &quot;CABC1&quot;).

Organisms other than humans produce the benzoquinone and isoprene structures from somewhat different source chemicals. For example, the bacteria &quot;E. coli&quot; produces the former from chorismate and the latter from a non-mevalonate source. The common yeast &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;, however, derives the former from either chorismate or tyrosine and the latter from mevalonate. Most organisms share the common 4-hydroxybenzoate intermediate, yet again uses different steps to arrive at the &quot;Q&quot; structure.

==Dietary supplement==
Although neither a prescription drug nor an essential nutrient, CoQ10 is commonly used as a dietary supplement with the intent to prevent or improve disease conditions, such as cardiovascular disorders. CoQ10 is naturally produced by the body and plays a crucial role in cell growth and protection. Despite its significant role in the body, it is not used as a drug to treat any specific disease.

Nevertheless, CoQ10 is widely available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement and is recommended by some healthcare professionals, despite a lack of definitive scientific evidence supporting these recommendations, especially when it comes to cardiovascular diseases.

==Regulation and composition==
CoQ10 is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of any medical condition. However, it is sold as a dietary supplement not subject to the same regulations as medicinal drugs, and is an ingredient in some cosmetics. The manufacture of CoQ10 is not regulated, and different batches and brands may vary significantly.

==Research==
A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to make a conclusion about its use for the prevention of heart disease. A 2016 Cochrane review concluded that CoQ10 had no effect on blood pressure. A 2021 Cochrane review found &quot;no convincing evidence to support or refute&quot; the use of CoQ10 for the treatment of heart failure.

A 2017 meta-analysis of people with heart failure taking 30–100 mg/d of CoQ10 found a 31% lower mortality and increased exercise capacity, with no significant difference in the endpoints of left heart ejection fraction. A 2021 meta-analysis found that coenzyme Q10 was associated with a 31% lower all-cause mortality in HF patients. In a 2023 meta-analysis of older people, ubiquinone had evidence of a cardiovascular effect, but ubiquinol did not.

Although CoQ10 has been studied as a potential remedy to treat purported muscle-related side effects of statin medications, the results were mixed. Although a 2018 meta-analysis concluded that there was preliminary evidence for oral CoQ10 reducing statin-associated muscle symptoms, including muscle pain, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, and muscle tiredness, 2015 and 2024 meta-analysis found that CoQ10 had no effect on statin myopathy.

CoQ10 is studied as an adjunctive therapy to reduce inflammation in periodontitis.

==Pharmacology==
===Absorption===
CoQ10 in the pure form is a crystalline powder insoluble in water. Absorption as a pharmacological substance follows the same process as that of lipids; the uptake mechanism appears to be similar to that of vitamin E, another lipid-soluble nutrient. This process in the human body involves secretion into the small intestine of pancreatic enzymes and bile, which facilitates emulsification and micelle formation required for absorption of lipophilic substances. Food intake (and the presence of lipids) stimulates bodily biliary excretion of bile acids and greatly enhances absorption of CoQ10. Exogenous CoQ10 is absorbed from the small intestine and is best absorbed if taken with a meal. Serum concentration of CoQ10 in fed condition is higher than in fasting conditions.

===Metabolism===
CoQ10 is metabolized in all tissues, with the metabolites phosphorylated in cells. CoQ10 is reduced to ubiquinol during or after absorption in the small intestine. It is absorbed by chylomicrons, and redistributed in the blood within lipoproteins. Its elimination occurs via biliary and fecal excretion.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Some reports have been published on the pharmacokinetics of CoQ10. The plasma peak can be observed 6–8 hours after oral administration when taken as a pharmacological substance. In some studies, a second plasma peak was observed approximately 24 hours after administration, probably due to enterohepatic recycling and redistribution from the liver to circulation.

Deuterium-labeled crystalline CoQ10 was used to investigate pharmacokinetics in humans to determine an elimination half-time of 33 hours.&quot;&quot;

===Bioavailability===
In contrast to the intake of CoQ10 as a constituent of food, such as nuts or meat, from which CoQ10 is normally absorbed, there is a concern about CoQ10 bioavailability when it is taken as a dietary supplement. Bioavailability of CoQ10 supplements may be reduced due to the lipophilic nature of its molecule and large molecular weight.

====Reduction of particle size====
Nanoparticles have been explored as a delivery system for various drugs, such as improving the oral bioavailability of drugs with poor absorption characteristics. However, this has not proved successful with CoQ10, although reports have differed widely. The use of aqueous suspension of finely powdered CoQ10 in pure water also reveals only a minor effect.

====Water-solubility====
Facilitating drug absorption by increasing its solubility in water is a common pharmaceutical strategy and also is successful for CoQ10. Various approaches have been developed to achieve this goal, with many of them producing significantly better results over oil-based soft gel capsules despite the many attempts to optimize their composition. Examples of such approaches are use of the aqueous dispersion of solid CoQ10 with the polymer tyloxapol, formulations based on various solubilising agents, such as hydrogenated lecithin, and complexation with cyclodextrins; among the latter, the complex with β-cyclodextrin has been found to have highly increased bioavailability and also is used in pharmaceutical and food industries for CoQ10-fortification.

==Adverse effects and precautions==
Generally, oral CoQ10 supplementation is well tolerated. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, appetite suppression, and abdominal pain), rashes, and headaches. Some adverse effects, largely gastrointestinal, are reported with intakes. Doses of 100–300 mg per day may induce insomnia or elevate liver enzymes. The observed safe level risk assessment method indicated that the evidence of safety is acceptable at intakes up to 1200 mg per day.

Caution should be observed in the use of CoQ10 supplementation in people with bile duct obstruction and during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

==Potential drug interactions ==
CoQ10 taken as a pharmacological substance has potential to inhibit the effects of theophylline as well as the anticoagulant warfarin; CoQ10 may interfere with warfarin&#x27;s actions by interacting with cytochrome p450 enzymes thereby reducing the INR, a measure of blood clotting. The structure of CoQ10 is similar to that of vitamin K, which competes with and counteracts warfarin&#x27;s anticoagulation effects. CoQ10 is not recommended in people taking warfarin due to the increased risk of clotting.

==Dietary concentrations==
Detailed reviews on occurrence of CoQ10 and dietary intake were published in 2010. Besides the endogenous synthesis within organisms, CoQ10 also is supplied by various foods. CoQ10 concentrations in various foods are:

Vegetable oils, meat, and fish are rich in CoQ10. Dairy products are much poorer sources of CoQ10 than animal tissues. Among vegetables, broccoli and cauliflower are good sources of CoQ10. Most fruits and berries are poor sources of CoQ10, except avocados, which have relatively high oil and CoQ10 content.

===Intake===
In the developed world, the estimated daily intake of CoQ10 has been determined at 3–6 mg per day, derived primarily from meat.

South Koreans have an estimated average daily CoQ (Q9 + Q10) intake of 11.6 mg/d, derived primarily from kimchi.

===Effect of heat and processing===
Cooking by frying reduces CoQ10 content by 14–32%.

==History==
In 1950, a small amount of CoQ10 was isolated from the lining of a horse&#x27;s gut, a compound initially called &quot;substance SA&quot;, but later deemed to be quinone found in many animal tissues. In 1957, the same compound was isolated from mitochondrial membranes of beef heart, with research showing that it transported electrons within mitochondria. It was called &quot;Q-275&quot; as a quinone. The Q-275/substance SA was later renamed &quot;ubiquinone&quot; as it was a &quot;ubiquitous&quot; quinone found in all animal tissues. In 1958, its full chemical structure was reported. Ubiquinone was later called either &quot;mitoquinone&quot; or &quot;coenzyme Q&quot; due to its participation to the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In 1966, a study reported that reduced CoQ6 was an effective antioxidant in cells.

<text>Pedro Pablo Zamora (born Pedro Pablo Zamora y Díaz, February 29, 1972 – November 11, 1994) was a Cuban-American AIDS educator and television personality. As one of the first openly gay men with AIDS to be portrayed in popular media, Zamora brought international attention to HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ issues and prejudices through his appearance on MTV&#x27;s reality television series &quot;The Real World: San Francisco&quot;.

Zamora&#x27;s romantic relationship with Sean Sasser was also documented on the show; their relationship was later nominated by MTV viewers for &quot;Favorite Love Story&quot; award, and the broadcast of their commitment ceremony in 1994, in which they exchanged vows, was the first such same-sex ceremony in television history, and is considered a landmark in the history of the medium.
U.S. President Bill Clinton credited Zamora with personalizing and humanizing those living with HIV—especially to Latino communities—with his activism, including his testimony before Congress. Zamora&#x27;s personal struggle with AIDS, and his conflict with housemate David &quot;Puck&quot; Rainey is credited with helping to make &quot;The Real World&quot; a hit show, for which &quot;Time&quot; ranked it #7 on its list of &quot;32 Epic Moments in Reality-TV History&quot;.

==Biography==
===1972–1988: Early life===
Pedro Zamora was born in Diezmero, San Miguel del Padrón, on the outskirts of Havana, Cuba, to Héctor Zamora, a food-warehouse worker, and Zoraida Díaz, a housewife. Zamora was their eighth and youngest child. Díaz had been told she could not have any more children, thus Zamora&#x27;s birth on a leap day was seen as charmed. Héctor had fought in the Cuban Revolution for Fidel Castro, but became disillusioned with changes after Castro came to power. This earned him an unfavorable reputation with local informants. As a result, life became increasingly difficult for the Zamoras, who lived in a small house with a dirt floor. Zoraida traded on the black market for food.

In 1980, when Zamora was eight, his family left Cuba for the United States during the Mariel boatlift. After five days of processing in Cuba, the entire family was to board when, hours before boarding, Cuban officials ruled that his four older brothers were too close to draft age and had to remain. His oldest sister, a communist official, chose to stay. The older siblings insisted, over their parents&#x27; objections, to leave without them to give their younger siblings a better life. Zamora and his parents, his sister Mily, and his brother Jesús left in a boat filled with 250 people that had been built for half that number. The Zamoras settled in Hialeah, Florida, a suburb of Miami.

Zamora&#x27;s mother died of skin cancer when he was 13. His older sister Mily helped raise him. Zamora focused on his schoolwork as a means of coping with his mother&#x27;s death. He was an honor student, president of the Science Club, and captain of the Cross-Country team. He excelled socially as well; his Hialeah High School classmates elected him as Most Intellectual and Best All-Around. He initially planned to become a doctor, as his mother&#x27;s death had inspired him to study medicine.

At 14, Zamora&#x27;s father discovered that he had a boyfriend. His father was accepting of Zamora&#x27;s homosexuality, but concerned about homophobia and its potential dangers. Although AIDS awareness was rising in America, Zamora was not educated about safe sex and AIDS prevention, as such things were not mentioned in school, with the exception of one guest lecture by a doctor who visited Zamora&#x27;s class when he was in the seventh grade. According to Judd Winick&#x27;s &quot;Pedro and Me&quot;, AIDS and its victims were characterized by the doctor as &quot;deviants, drug addicts, prostitutes&quot;.

===1989–93: HIV-positive diagnosis and activism===

In late 1989, in his junior year of high school, 17-year-old Zamora donated blood during a Red Cross blood drive. A month later, he received a letter from the Red Cross informing him that his blood tested &quot;reactive&quot;, though it did not specify for what. Zamora decided to be tested for HIV, and on November 9, 1989, the results confirmed he was HIV-positive.

His family was devastated but remained supportive. Zamora&#x27;s goal was to graduate from high school before he died, and he did so in 1990. Five months later, he suffered a severe case of shingles. Upon recovery, Zamora joined a Miami-based HIV/AIDS resource center called Body Positive. There he met others with HIV and AIDS, learned more about the disease and how he could still have a fulfilling life. Soon thereafter, he began to talk about his condition to others, wanting to raise awareness in his community.

Zamora soon became a full-time AIDS educator. He lectured at schools for all ages, at PTA meetings, and in churches. In five years, he spoke nationwide hundreds of times, attended an international AIDS conference, and even served on the board of a charitable trust endowed by insurance companies—despite being denied insurance for himself. The constant travel exhausted Zamora, sometimes forcing him to cancel speaking engagements. In 1991, his work came to national attention when Eric Morganthaler wrote a front-page article about him for the &quot;Wall Street Journal.&quot; The publicity resulted in invitations to talk show interviews by Geraldo Rivera, Phil Donahue and Oprah Winfrey. On July 12, 1993, he testified before the United States Congress, arguing for more explicit HIV/AIDS educational programs, saying, &quot;If you want to reach me as a young man, especially a young gay man of color, then you need to give me information in a language and vocabulary I can understand and relate to.&quot;

Zamora attended the 1993 Lesbian and Gay March on Washington, where he met Sean Sasser, also an AIDS educator, who would eventually become his partner. Sasser was moved by Zamora&#x27;s presence and conviction, recalling, &quot;I was kind of like, &#x27;Wow.&#x27; I had never run across someone who was as good at it as he was.&quot; Sasser lived in San Francisco, and shortly after he&#x27;d met Zamora, he&#x27;d learned that producers of the MTV reality TV show &quot;The Real World&quot; were looking for an HIV positive person to cast in the 1994 season in San Francisco.

===1993–94: &quot;The Real World&quot;===
Zamora sent an audition tape for the show, thinking that he could reach more people simply by the national exposure than by constant travel. Six months later, Zamora was cast on the show, beating out 25,000 applicants.

Zamora and his castmates (Mohammed Bilal, Rachel Campos, Pam Ling, Cory Murphy, David &quot;Puck&quot; Rainey, and Judd Winick) moved into the house at 953 Lombard Street on Russian Hill on February 12, 1994. The producers had informed the other six castmates that one person was HIV-positive, but did not specify whom. Once all of the castmates were in the house, Zamora informed them that it was he who was HIV-positive, showing them a scrapbook of his career as an AIDS educator. At the time, Ling was the only castmate with background on how HIV was transmitted, being a medical school student.

All of the castmates were receptive to Zamora, but Rachel Campos privately expressed (during the show&#x27;s routine &#x27;confessionals&#x27;) her discomfort with Zamora&#x27;s being HIV-positive. She was concerned how HIV would possibly affect her and the others in the house. She was afraid to bring up her concerns during the initial meeting, for fear of seeming intolerant. Thus, Campos initially distanced herself from Zamora, which Zamora interpreted as rejection.

Later, Zamora educated Campos about HIV and AIDS, which eased her apprehension. Despite very differing political views, they formed a rapport as the show progressed. On one episode, Campos brought Zamora to meet her Spanish-Mexican family in Arizona. By the season&#x27;s end, however, Zamora expressed his disappointment to Campos that they did not become the close friends that they could have been.

Winick stated that Zamora had an almost &quot;clairvoyant&quot; ability to broach sensitive subjects. Despite Winick&#x27;s never voicing it, Zamora sensed that Winick had lingering worries about sharing a room with him. Zamora educated Winick subtly through casual conversation, so much so that Winick did not even realize it. In later episodes, Winick, Ling, and Murphy often attended Zamora&#x27;s lectures at schools in the Bay Area, wanting to learn more about HIV and AIDS.

During filming of the show, Zamora and Sean Sasser began dating, and quickly became a couple. Sasser eventually proposed to Zamora, and the two exchanged vows in a commitment ceremony held in the Real World house. In so doing, they made history as the first same-sex commitment ceremony on TV. Their relationship was nominated for &quot;Favorite Love Story&quot; at the 2008 &quot;Real Worlds Awards Bash&quot;.

Midway through filming, Zamora&#x27;s health suddenly declined. He was suffering night sweats, bouts of pneumonia, fatigue, and weight loss. Producer Jon Murray stated, &quot;He got sick much faster than he expected. That&#x27;s when he made us promise to tell his story till the end.&quot; The stress of the perpetual conflict between Zamora and castmate Rainey was contributing to his decline. Rainey&#x27;s antagonism towards Zamora included mocking his Cuban accent, dismissing Zamora&#x27;s and Sasser&#x27;s relationship, and multiple homophobic comments. Zamora announced he was moving out, as Rainey&#x27;s antics had become intolerable. The other castmates unanimously agreed that they wanted Zamora to stay, and evicted Rainey. &quot;Time&quot; ranked this episode #7 on its list of &quot;32 Epic Moments in Reality-TV History&quot;.

Zamora was able to participate in activities like parasailing during the cast&#x27;s trip to Hawaii, giving viewers the impression that he was healthier than he actually was. The castmates knew he was unwell and often covered for him during their weekly confessional interviews, saying Zamora was doing fine when they knew otherwise.

===1994: After &quot;The Real World&quot; and death===

The cast vacated the Real World house on June 19, 1994, and the first episodes of &quot;The Real World: San Francisco&quot; began airing a week later. Zamora visited his family in Miami before returning to San Francisco to live with Sasser.

When Winick, Zamora, Murphy, and Ling met in August for a reunion party, Zamora was visibly ill. Once talkative, he was often silent, having difficulty following conversations, and forgetting familiar places. He went to the MTV offices in New York, and could not recognize where he was. On August 17, Zamora checked into St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital and was diagnosed with toxoplasmosis, a condition that causes brain lesions, fatigue, headaches and confusion. Further tests revealed he had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a very rare and usually fatal viral inflammation of the brain that disrupts the electrical impulses of the nervous system. PML can dissipate on its own in patients with T-cell counts higher than 300–400. At the time, Zamora&#x27;s T-cell count was 32. The inflammation was attacking the frontal lobe of his brain, causing his short-term memory loss. Zamora was given three to four months to live.

On September 3, about three weeks after checking into St. Vincent&#x27;s, Zamora was flown to Mercy Hospital in Miami, and his family gathered around him. Then-President Bill Clinton called Zamora to thank him for his work. Zamora is said to have expressed elation and was able to respond, though Mily Zamora stated that whether he understood who was calling is unclear, given the severity of his PML.

As a gesture of gratitude for his work, Clinton asked if there was anything he could do for the Zamora family. They replied that they wanted Zamora&#x27;s remaining siblings in Cuba to be with him in his final days. This resulted in Alonso R. del Portillo, Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, and Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen forming an agreement with Cuba that would admit 20,000 Cubans per year to the United States. Zamora&#x27;s three brothers and their families arrived in the next couple of weeks, reuniting the family for the first time in 14 years.

On October 21, Winick announced that MTV had set up a trust fund in order to pay for Zamora&#x27;s medical costs, as Zamora had no medical insurance. He had received Medicaid, but was rejected for any private company coverage due his pre-existing condition of HIV.

Before his hospitalization, Zamora told his family to not keep him alive by artificial means—his mother had a prolonged death, and he wanted to spare his family that pain. Zamora developed a high fever. Once he became unresponsive, his family honored his wishes and withdrew life support. Surrounded by his family, longtime friend Alex Escarano, Sasser, Winick, and Ling, Zamora died at 4:40 a.m. EST on November 11, 1994, at the age of 22, hours after the final episode of &quot;The Real World: San Francisco&quot; aired. He was buried on November 13.

==Legacy and tribute==
After his death, Zamora was publicly praised by President Clinton and Donna Shalala for his leadership and work in educating high school students, saying that through his appearance on &quot;The Real World&quot;, Pedro had become a part of viewers&#x27; families, and that all people who watched the show could now say that they knew someone who had lived with AIDS.

MTV broadcast &quot;A Tribute to Pedro Zamora&quot;, a special memorial program, in Zamora&#x27;s honor.
On February 28, 1995, the portion of the street in front of McMillan Middle School in Miami was renamed Pedro Zamora Way in a ceremony attended by Zamora&#x27;s father and sister Mily.

A number of organizations were created in Pedro&#x27;s name, including:

* National Pedro Zamora Foundation, which was founded by Winick, Ling, Mily Zamora, and Sasser (All four founders later distanced themselves from the foundation due to conflicts with its president, Brian Quintana).
* The Pedro Zamora Memorial Fund, created by the AIDS Action Foundation
* The Pedro Zamora Youth HIV Clinic 
* The Pedro Zamora Public Policy Fellowship

Mily Zamora became a public speaker about AIDS. Winick continued lecturing on behalf of Zamora for three years. His autobiographical graphic novel, &quot;Pedro and Me: Friendship, Loss, and What I Learned&quot;, was published in September 2000. It was nominated for the 2001 Eisner Award for Best Graphic Album: New, won a 2001 American Library Association Stonewall Book Award for Non-Fiction Honor Books, and the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic. It has been incorporated into school curricula across the country, such as UCLA, which made it its common book in 2013. Winick&#x27;s experiences with Zamora would also help shape his work in mainstream superhero comics, which would receive considerable media attention for storylines in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; and &quot;Green Arrow&quot;, which explored gay or AIDS-related themes.

Ling went on to devote her medical research to HIV and AIDS.

Pedro&#x27;s partner, Sean Sasser, continued his activism for LGBT issues, and his work as an HIV educator. In 1995, he spoke at the inaugural White House AIDS conference, and was appointed by President Clinton to the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. He became a pastry chef in Atlanta, Portland, and finally Washington, DC., at RIS restaurant. In June 2013 Sasser married Michael Kaplan, whom he had dated off and on after Zamora&#x27;s death, and with whom he had moved in six months prior. While in Washington, Sasser served as a board member of the AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth and Families. He was active in youth and mentoring organizations, and he and Kaplan served as foster parents to a four-year-old girl. In July 2013, Sasser, who had also been HIV positive for 25 years, was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare cancer of the lungs. He died at his home on August 7, 2013, at the age of 44.

Queer theorist José Esteban Muñoz dedicated a chapter to Zamora in his 1999 book &quot;Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics&quot; In the chapter titled, &quot;Pedro Zamora&#x27;s Real World of Counterpublicity: Performing Ethics of Self,&quot; Muñoz describes the ways in which Zamora used the shows&#x27; confessional booth to perform an ethics of self, and in doing so disidentified with the mainstream.

In 2008, Bunim-Murray Productions produced a film, &quot;Pedro&quot;, directed by Nick Oceano, dramatizing Zamora&#x27;s life. The film was an Official Selection at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, and was Bunim-Murray&#x27;s first scripted project. Zamora was portrayed by Alex Loynaz.

In 2009, the National AIDS Memorial Grove in San Francisco began the Youth Essay Scholarship Program, renamed the Pedro Zamora Young Leaders Scholarship in 2014. Every August, the scholarship program gives awards ranging from $2,500 to $5,000 to high school seniors and college students who are actively fighting HIV/AIDS through public service and leadership.

In June 2019, Zamora was one of the inaugural fifty American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, while The Wall&#x27;s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

A 2021 documentary by William T. Horner, &quot;Keep the Cameras Rolling: The Pedro Zamora Way&quot; chronicles Zamora&#x27;s journey with AIDS and reality television.

<text>Le Sony&#x27;r Ra (born Herman Poole Blount, May 22, 1914 – May 30, 1993), better known as Sun Ra, was an American jazz composer, bandleader, piano and synthesizer player, and poet known for his experimental music, &quot;cosmic&quot; philosophy, prolific output, and theatrical performances. For much of his career, Ra led The Arkestra, an ensemble with an ever-changing name and flexible line-up.

Born and raised in Alabama, Blount became involved in the Chicago jazz scene during the late 1940s. He soon abandoned his birth name, taking the name Le Sony&#x27;r Ra, shortened to Sun Ra (after Ra, the Egyptian god of the Sun). Claiming to be an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace, he developed a mythical persona and an idiosyncratic credo that made him a pioneer of Afrofuturism. Throughout his life he denied ties to his prior identity saying, &quot;Any name that I use other than Ra is a pseudonym.&quot; His widely eclectic and avant-garde music echoed the entire history of jazz, from ragtime and early New Orleans hot jazz, to swing music, bebop, free jazz and fusion. His compositions ranged from keyboard solos to works for big bands of over 30 musicians, along with electronic excursions, songs, chants, percussion pieces, and anthems.

From the mid-1950s until his death, Ra led the musical collective The Arkestra, which featured artists such as Marshall Allen, John Gilmore and June Tyson throughout its various iterations. Its performances often included dancers and musicians dressed in elaborate, futuristic costumes inspired by ancient Egyptian attire and the Space Age. Following Ra&#x27;s retirement in 1992 due to illness, the band remained active as The Sun Ra Arkestra, and, as of 2024, continues performing under the leadership of veteran Ra sideman Marshall Allen.

Though his mainstream success was limited, Ra was a prolific recording artist and frequent live performer, and remained influential throughout his life for his music and persona. He is now widely considered an innovator; among his distinctions are his pioneering work in free improvisation and modal jazz and his early use of electronic keyboards and synthesizers. Over his career, he recorded dozens of singles and over 100 full-length albums, comprising well over 1,000 songs, making him one of the most prolific recording artists of the 20th century.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born Herman Blount on May 22, 1914, in Birmingham, Alabama, as discovered by his biographer, John F. Szwed, and published in his 1998 book, &quot;Space Is the Place: The Lives and Times of Sun Ra&quot;. He was named after the popular vaudeville stage magician Black Herman, who had deeply impressed his mother. He was nicknamed &quot;Sonny&quot; from his childhood, had an older sister and half-brother, and was doted upon by his mother and grandmother.

For decades, very little was known about Sun Ra&#x27;s early life, and he contributed to its mystique. As a self-invented person, he routinely gave evasive, contradictory or seemingly nonsensical answers to personal questions, and denied his birth name. He speculated, only half in jest, that he was distantly related to Elijah Poole, later known as Elijah Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam. His birthday for years remained unknown, as his claims ranged from 1910 to 1918. Only a few years before his death, the date of Sun Ra&#x27;s birth was still a mystery. Jim Macnie&#x27;s notes for &quot;Blue Delight&quot; (1989) said that Sun Ra was believed to be about 75 years old. This turned out to be correct; Szwed was able to uncover a wealth of information about his early life, and confirmed a birth date of May 22, 1914.

As a child, Blount was a skilled pianist. By the age of 11 or 12, he was composing and sight reading music. Birmingham was an important stop for touring musicians and he saw prominent musicians such as Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, and Fats Waller, and other less well known performers. Sun Ra once said, &quot;The world let down a lot of good musicians&quot;.

In his teenage years, Blount demonstrated prodigious musical talent: many times, according to acquaintances, he went to big band performances and then produced full transcriptions of the bands&#x27; songs from memory. By his mid-teens, Blount was performing semi-professionally as a solo pianist, or as a member of various &quot;ad hoc&quot; jazz and R&amp;B groups. He attended Birmingham&#x27;s segregated Industrial High School (now known as Parker High School), where he studied under music teacher John T. &quot;Fess&quot; Whatley, a demanding disciplinarian who was widely respected and whose classes produced many professional musicians.

Though deeply religious, his family was not formally associated with any Christian church or sect. Blount had few or no close friends in high school but was remembered as kind-natured and quiet, an honor roll student, and a voracious reader. He took advantage of the Black Masonic Lodge as one of the few places in Birmingham where African Americans had unlimited access to books. Its collection on Freemasonry and other esoteric concepts made a strong impression on him.

By his teens, Blount suffered from cryptorchidism. It left him with a nearly constant discomfort that sometimes flared into severe pain. Szwed suggests that Blount felt shame about it and the condition contributed to his isolation.

===Early professional career and college===
In 1934, Blount was offered his first full-time musical job by Ethel Harper, his biology teacher from the high school, who had organized a band to pursue a career as a singer. Blount joined a musicians&#x27; trade union and toured with Harper&#x27;s group through the US Southeast and Midwest. When Harper left the group mid-tour to move to New York (she later was a member of the modestly successful singing group the Ginger Snaps), Blount took over leadership of the group, renaming it the Sonny Blount Orchestra. They continued touring for several months before dissolving as unprofitable. Though the first edition of the Sonny Blount Orchestra was not financially successful, they earned positive notice from fans and other musicians. Blount afterward found steady employment as a musician in Birmingham.

Birmingham clubs often featured exotic trappings, such as vivid lighting and murals with tropical or oasis scenes. Some believe these influenced the elements Sun Ra incorporated in his later stage shows. Playing for the big bands gave black musicians a sense of pride and togetherness, and they were highly regarded in the black community. They were expected to be disciplined and presentable, and in the segregated South, black musicians had wide acceptance in white society. They often played for elite white society audiences (though they were typically forbidden from associating with the audience).

In 1936, Whatley&#x27;s intercession led to Blount&#x27;s being awarded a scholarship at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University. He was a music education major, studying composition, orchestration, and music theory. He dropped out after a year.

===Trip to Saturn===
Blount left college because, he claimed, he had a visionary experience as a college student that had a major, long-term influence on him. In 1936 or 1937, in the midst of deep religious concentration, Sun Ra claimed that a bright light appeared around him, and, as he later said:
Blount claimed that this experience occurred in 1936 or 1937. According to Szwed, the musician&#x27;s closest associates cannot date the story any earlier than 1952. (Blount also said that the incident happened when he was living in Chicago, where he did not settle until the late 1940s). Sun Ra discussed the vision, with no substantive variation, to the end of his life. His trip to Saturn allegedly occurred a full decade before flying saucers entered public consciousness with the 1947 encounter of Kenneth Arnold. It was earlier than other public accounts: about 15 years before George Adamski wrote about contact with benevolent beings; and almost 20 years before the 1961 case of Barney and Betty Hill, who recounted sinister UFO abductions. Szwed says that, &quot;even if this story is revisionist autobiography... Sonny was pulling together several strains of his life. He was both prophesizing his future and explaining his past with a single act of personal mythology.&quot;

===New devotion to music (late 1930s)===
After leaving college, Blount became known as the most singularly devoted musician in Birmingham. He rarely slept, citing Thomas Edison, Leonardo da Vinci, and Napoleon as fellow highly productive cat-nappers. He transformed the first floor of his family&#x27;s home into a conservatory-workshop, where he wrote songs, transcribed recordings, rehearsed with the many musicians who drifted in and out, and discussed Biblical and esoteric concepts with whoever was interested.

Blount became a regular at Birmingham&#x27;s Forbes Piano Company, a white-owned company. Blount visited the Forbes building almost daily to play music, swap ideas with staff and customers, or copy sheet music into his notebooks. He formed a new band, and like his old teacher Whatley, insisted on rigorous daily rehearsals. The new Sonny Blount Orchestra earned a reputation as an impressive, disciplined band that could play in a wide variety of styles with equal skill.

===Draft and wartime experiences===
In October 1942, Blount received a selective service notification that he had been drafted into the Military of the United States. He quickly declared himself a conscientious objector, citing religious objections to war and killing, his financial support of his great-aunt Ida, and his chronic hernia. The local draft board rejected his claim. In an appeal to the national draft board, Blount wrote that the lack of black men on the draft appeal board &quot;smacks of Hitlerism.&quot; Sonny&#x27;s refusal to join the military deeply embarrassed his family, and many relatives ostracized him. He was eventually approved for alternate service at Civilian Public Service camp in Pennsylvania, but he did not appear at the camp as required on December 8, 1942. Shortly after, he was arrested in Alabama.

In court, Blount said that alternate service was unacceptable; he debated the judge on points of law and Biblical interpretation. The judge ruled that Blount was violating the law and was at risk for being drafted into the U.S. military. Blount responded that if inducted, he would use military weapons and training to kill the first high-ranking military officer possible. The judge sentenced Blount to jail (pending draft board and CPS rulings), and then said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen a nigger like you before.&quot; Blount replied, &quot;No, and you never will again.&quot;

In January 1943, Blount wrote to the United States Marshals Service from the Walker County, Alabama jail in Jasper. He said he was facing a nervous breakdown from the stress of imprisonment, that he was suicidal, and that he was in constant fear of sexual assault. When his conscientious objector status was reaffirmed in February 1943, he was escorted to Pennsylvania. He did forestry work as assigned during the day and was allowed to play piano at night. Psychiatrists there described him as &quot;a psychopathic personality [and] sexually perverted,&quot; but also as &quot;a well-educated colored intellectual.&quot;

In March 1943, the draft board reclassified Blount as 4-F because of his hernia, and he returned to Birmingham, embittered and angered. He formed a new band and soon was playing professionally. After his beloved great-aunt Ida died in 1945, Blount felt no reason to stay in Birmingham. He dissolved the band, and moved to Chicago—part of the Second Great Migration, southern African Americans who moved north during and after World War II.

===Chicago years (1945–1961)===
In Chicago, Blount quickly found work, notably with blues singer Wynonie Harris, with whom he made his recording debut on two 1946 singles, &quot;Dig This Boogie&quot;/&quot;Lightning Struck the Poorhouse&quot;, and &quot;My Baby&#x27;s Barrelhouse&quot;/&quot;Drinking By Myself&quot;. &quot;Dig This Boogie&quot; was also Blount&#x27;s first recorded piano solo. He performed with the locally successful Lil Green band and played bump-and-grind music for months in Calumet City strip clubs.

In August 1946, Blount earned a lengthy engagement at the Club DeLisa under bandleader and composer Fletcher Henderson. Blount had long admired Henderson, but Henderson&#x27;s fortunes had declined (his band was now made of up middling musicians rather than the stars of earlier years) in large part because of his instability, due to Henderson&#x27;s long-term injuries from a car accident. Henderson hired Blount as pianist and arranger, replacing Marl Young. Blount&#x27;s arrangements initially showed a degree of bebop influence, but the band members resisted the new music, despite Henderson&#x27;s encouragement.

In 1948, Blount performed briefly in a trio with saxophonist Coleman Hawkins and violinist Stuff Smith, both preeminent musicians. There are no known recordings of this trio, but home recordings of two different Blount-Smith duets from 1953 appear on &quot;Sound Sun Pleasure!!&quot; and &quot;Deep Purple&quot;, and one of Sun Ra&#x27;s final recordings in 1992 was a rare sideman appearance on violinist Billy Bang&#x27;s &quot;Tribute to Stuff Smith&quot;.

In addition to enabling professional advancement, what he encountered in Chicago changed Blount&#x27;s personal outlook. The city was a center of African-American political activism and fringe movements, with Black Muslims, Black Hebrews, and others proselytizing, debating, and printing leaflets or books. Blount absorbed it all and was fascinated with the city&#x27;s many ancient Egyptian-styled buildings and monuments. He read books such as George G.M. James&#x27;s &quot;Stolen Legacy&quot; (which argued that classical Greek philosophy had its roots in ancient Egypt). Blount concluded that the accomplishments and history of Africans had been systematically suppressed and denied by European cultures.

By 1952, Blount was leading the Space Trio with drummer Tommy &quot;Bugs&quot; Hunter and saxophonist Pat Patrick, two of the most accomplished musicians he had known. They performed regularly, and Sun Ra began writing more advanced songs.

On October 20, 1952, Blount legally changed his name to Le Sony&#x27;r Ra. Sun Ra claimed to have always been uncomfortable with his birth name of Blount. He considered it a slave name, from a family that was not his. David Martinelli suggested that his change was similar to &quot;Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali... [dropping] their slave names in the process of attaining a new self-awareness and self-esteem&quot;.

Patrick left the group to move to Florida with his new wife. His friend John Gilmore (tenor sax) joined the group, and Marshall Allen (alto sax) soon followed. Patrick was in and out of the group until the end of his life, but Allen and Gilmore were the two most devoted members of the Arkestra. In fact, Gilmore is often criticized for staying with Sun Ra for over forty years when he could have been a strong leader in his own right. Saxophonist James Spaulding and trombonist Julian Priester also recorded with Sun Ra in Chicago, and both went on to careers of their own. The Chicago tenor Von Freeman also did a short stint with the band of the early 1950s.

In Chicago, Sun Ra met Alton Abraham, a precociously intelligent teenager and something of a kindred spirit. He became the Arkestra&#x27;s biggest booster and one of Sun Ra&#x27;s closest friends. Both men felt like outsiders and shared an interest in esoterica. Abraham&#x27;s strengths balanced Ra&#x27;s shortcomings: though he was a disciplined bandleader, Sun Ra was somewhat introverted and lacked business sense (a trait that haunted his entire career). Abraham was outgoing, well-connected, and practical. Though still a teenager, Abraham eventually became Sun Ra&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; business manager: he booked performances, suggested musicians for the Arkestra, and introduced several popular songs into the group&#x27;s repertoire. Ra, Abraham and others formed a sort of book club to trade ideas and discuss the offbeat topics that so intrigued them. This group printed a number of pamphlets and broadsides explaining their conclusions and ideas. Some of these were collected by critic John Corbett and Anthony Elms as &quot;The Wisdom of Sun Ra: Sun Ra&#x27;s Polemical Broadsheets and Streetcorner Leaflets&quot; (2006).

In the mid-1950s, Sun Ra and Abraham formed an independent record label that was generally known as El Saturn Records. (It had several name variations.) Initially focused on 45 rpm singles by Sun Ra and artists related to him, Saturn Records issued two full-length albums during the 1950s: &quot;Super-Sonic Jazz&quot; (1957) and &quot;Jazz In Silhouette&quot; (1959). Producer Tom Wilson was the first to release a Sun Ra album, through his independent label Transition Records in 1957, entitled &quot;Jazz by Sun Ra&quot;. During this era, Sun Ra recorded the first of dozens of singles as a band-for-hire backing a range of doo wop and R&amp;B singers; several dozen of these were reissued in a two-CD set, &quot;The Singles&quot;, by Evidence Records.

In the late 1950s, Sun Ra and his band began to wear outlandish, Egyptian-styled or science fiction-themed costumes and headdresses. These costumes had multiple purposes: they expressed Sun Ra&#x27;s fascination with ancient Egypt and the space age, they provided a recognizable uniform for the Arkestra, they provided a new identity for the band onstage, and comic relief. (Sun Ra thought &quot;avant garde&quot; musicians typically took themselves far too seriously.)

===New York years (1961–1968)===
Sun Ra and the Arkestra moved to New York City in the fall of 1961. To save money, Sun Ra and his band members lived communally. This enabled Sun Ra to request rehearsals spontaneously and at any time, which was his established habit. It was during this time in New York that Sun Ra recorded the album &quot;The Futuristic Sound of Sun Ra.&quot;

In March 1966, the Arkestra secured a regular Monday night gig at Slug&#x27;s Saloon. This was a breakthrough to new audiences and recognition. Sun Ra&#x27;s popularity reached an early peak during this period, as the beat generation and early followers of psychedelia embraced him. Regularly for the next year and a half (and intermittently for another half-decade afterwards), Sun Ra and company performed at Slug&#x27;s for audiences that eventually came to include music critics and leading jazz musicians. Opinions of Sun Ra&#x27;s music were divided (and hecklers were not uncommon).

High praise, however, came from two of the architects of bebop. Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie offered encouragement, once stating, &quot;Keep it up, Sonny, they tried to do the same shit to me,&quot; and pianist Thelonious Monk chided someone who said Sun Ra was &quot;too far out&quot; by responding: &quot;Yeah, but it &quot;swings&quot;.&quot;

Also in 1966, Sun Ra, with members of the Arkestra and Al Kooper&#x27;s Blues Project, recorded the album &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; under the pseudonym, The Sensational Guitars of Dan and Dale. The album consisted primarily of instrumental variations on the Batman Theme and public domain classical music, with an uncredited female vocalist singing the &quot;Robin Theme.&quot;

Despite their planned management of money, the costs of New York eventually became too high and motivated the group to move to Philadelphia.

===Philadelphia years (1968)===
In 1968, when the New York building they were renting was put up for sale, Sun Ra and the Arkestra relocated to the Germantown section of Philadelphia. Sun Ra moved into a house on Morton Street that became the Arkestra&#x27;s base of operations until his death. It eventually became known as the Arkestral Institute of Sun Ra. Apart from occasional complaints about the noise of rehearsals, they were soon regarded as good neighbors because of their friendliness, drug-free living, and rapport with youngsters. The saxophonist Danny Ray Thompson owned and operated the Pharaoh&#x27;s Den, a convenience store in the neighborhood. When lightning struck a tree on their street, Sun Ra took it as a good omen. James Jacson fashioned the Cosmic Infinity Drum from the scorched tree trunk. They commuted via railroad to New York for the Monday night gig at Slug&#x27;s and for other engagements.

Sun Ra became a fixture in Philadelphia, appearing semi-regularly on WXPN radio, giving lectures to community groups, or visiting the city&#x27;s libraries. In the mid-1970s, the Arkestra sometimes played free Saturday afternoon concerts in a Germantown park near their home. At their mid-1970s shows in Philadelphia nightclubs, someone stood at the back of the room, selling stacks of unmarked LPs in plain white sleeves, pressed from recordings of the band&#x27;s live performances.

===California and world tours (1968–1993)===
In late 1968, Sun Ra and the Arkestra made their first tour of the US West Coast. Reactions were mixed. Some hippies accustomed to long-form psychedelia like the Grateful Dead were entranced and enthralled by the Arkestra, others merely bewildered. San Francisco was friendly to avant grade jazz from the early 50s and quickly welcomed Sun Ra&#x27;s music. By this time, the performance included 20–30 musicians, dancers, singers, fire-eaters, and elaborate lighting. John Burks of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote a positive review of a San Jose State College concert. Sun Ra was featured on the April 19, 1969 cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, which introduced his inscrutable gaze to millions. During this tour, Damon Choice, then an art student at San Jose, joined the Arkestra and became its vibraphonist.

Starting with concerts in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in 1970, the Arkestra began to tour internationally. They played to audiences who had known his music only through records. Sun Ra continued playing in Europe almost to the end of his life. The saxophonist Danny Ray Thompson became a &quot;de facto&quot; tour and business manager during this era, specializing in what he called &quot;no bullshit C.O.D.,&quot; preferring to take cash before performing or delivering records.

In early 1971, Sun Ra was appointed as artist-in-residence at University of California, Berkeley, teaching a course called &quot;The Black Man In the Cosmos&quot;. Few students enrolled, but his classes were often full of curious people from the surrounding community. One half-hour of each class was devoted to a lecture (complete with handouts and homework assignments), the other half-hour to an Arkestra performance or Sun Ra keyboard solo. Reading lists included the works of Madame Blavatsky and Henry Dumas, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Alexander Hislop&#x27;s &quot;The Two Babylons&quot;, The Book of Oahspe, and assorted volumes concerning Egyptian hieroglyphs, African American folklore, and other topics.

In 1971, Sun Ra traveled throughout Egypt with the Arkestra at the invitation of the drummer Salah Ragab. He returned to Egypt in 1983 and 1984, when he recorded with Ragab. Recordings made in Egypt were released as &quot;Live in Egypt&quot;, &quot;Nidhamu&quot;, &quot;Sun Ra Meets Salah Ragab&quot;, &quot;Egypt Strut&quot; and &quot;Horizon&quot;.

In 1972, San Francisco public TV station KQED producer John Coney, producer Jim Newman, and screenwriter Joshua Smith worked with Sun Ra to produce an 85-minute feature film, entitled &quot;Space Is the Place&quot;, with Sun Ra&#x27;s Arkestra and an ensemble of actors assembled by the production team. It was filmed in Oakland and San Francisco. A 1975 show concert by the Arkestra in Cleveland featured an early lineup of Devo as the opening act. On May 20, 1978, Sun Ra and the Arkestra appeared on the TV show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (S3 E20).

In New York City in the fall of 1979, Sun Ra and the Arkestra played as the &quot;house band&quot; at the Squat Theatre on 23rd Street, which was the performance venue of the avant-garde Hungarian theater troupe. Janos, their manager, transformed the theater into a nightclub while most of the troupe was away that season performing in Europe. Debbie Harry, The Velvet Underground&#x27;s John Cale and Nico (from Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory days), John Lurie and The Lounge Lizards, and other pop and avant-garde musicians were regulars. Sun Ra was disciplined and drank only club soda at the gigs, but did not impose his strict code on his musicians. They respected his discipline and authority. Soft-spoken and charismatic, Sun Ra turned Squat Theater into a universe of big band &quot;space&quot; jazz backed by a floor show of sexy Jupiterettes. He directed while playing three synthesizers at the same time. In those days, &quot;Space Is The Place&quot; was the space at Squat.

The Arkestra continued their touring and recording through the 1980s and into the 1990s.

===Death===
Sun Ra had a stroke in 1990, but kept composing, performing, and leading the Arkestra. Late in his career, he opened a few concerts for the New York–based rock group Sonic Youth. When too ill to perform and tour, Sun Ra appointed Gilmore to lead the Arkestra. (Gilmore was frail from emphysema; after his death in 1995, Allen took over leadership of the Arkestra.)

In late 1992, Sun Ra returned to his birth city of Birmingham to live with his older sister, Mary Jenkins, who (along with various Blount cousins) became his caretaker. In January, he was admitted to Princeton Baptist Medical Center, suffering from congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, strokes, circulatory problems, and other serious maladies. He died in the hospital on May 30, 1993, and was buried at the Elmwood Cemetery. The footstone reads &quot;Herman Sonny Blount aka Le Sony&#x27;r Ra&quot;.

==The Arkestra==

Following Sun Ra&#x27;s death, the Arkestra was led by tenor saxophonist John Gilmore and later performed under the direction of alto saxophonist Marshall Allen. A 1999 album led by Allen, &quot;Song for the Sun&quot;, featured Jimmy Hopps and Dick Griffin. In the summer of 2004 the Arkestra became the first American jazz band to perform in Tuva, in southern Siberia, where they played five sets at the Ustuu-Huree Festival.

As of July 2019, the Arkestra continues to tour and perform. In September 2008 they played for 7 days in a row at the ZXZW festival, each day emphasizing different aspects of the musical legacy of Sun Ra. In 2009, they performed at Philadelphia&#x27;s Institute of Contemporary Art in conjunction with an exhibition that explored the intersection of the Arkestra&#x27;s performing legacy and the practice of contemporary art. In 2011, they ventured to Australia for the first time, for the 2011 Melbourne International Jazz Festival and MONA (Museum of Old and New Art) in Tasmania. In 2017, the Arkestra performed at the 31st Lowell Folk Festival in Lowell Massachusetts. In 2019, it was announced that the Arkestra would perform at Portland, Oregon&#x27;s Hollywood Theater for three nights on July 14, 15, and 16. On October 22, 2021, they performed at the BRIC JazzFest in Downtown Brooklyn.

==Music==
Sun Ra&#x27;s piano technique touched on many styles: his youthful fascination with boogie woogie, stride piano and blues, a sometimes refined touch reminiscent of Count Basie or Ahmad Jamal, and angular phrases in the style of Thelonious Monk or brutal, percussive attacks like Cecil Taylor. Often overlooked is the range of influences from classical music – Sun Ra cited Chopin, Rachmaninoff, Schoenberg and Shostakovich as his favorite composers for the piano.

Sun Ra&#x27;s music can be roughly divided into three phases, but his records and performances were full of surprises and the following categories should be regarded only as approximations.

===Chicago phase===
The first period occurred in the 1950s when Sun Ra&#x27;s music evolved from big band swing into the outer-space-themed &quot;cosmic jazz&quot; for which he was best known. Music critics and jazz historians say some of his best work was recorded during this period and it is also some of his most accessible music. Sun Ra&#x27;s music in this era was often tightly arranged and sometimes reminiscent of Duke Ellington&#x27;s, Count Basie&#x27;s, or other important swing music ensembles. However, there was a strong influence from post-swing styles like bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz, and touches of the exotic and hints of the experimentalism that dominated his later music. Notable Sun Ra albums from the 1950s include &quot;Sun Ra Visits Planet Earth&quot;, &quot;Interstellar Low Ways&quot;, &quot;Super-Sonic Jazz&quot;, &quot;We Travel the Space Ways&quot;, &quot;The Nubians of Plutonia&quot; and &quot;Jazz In Silhouette&quot;.

Ronnie Boykins, Sun Ra&#x27;s bassist, has been described as &quot;the pivot around which much of Sun Ra&#x27;s music revolved for eight years.&quot; This is especially pronounced on the key recordings from 1965 (&quot;The Magic City&quot;, &quot;The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Volume One&quot;, and &quot;The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Volume Two&quot;) where the intertwining lines of Boykins&#x27; bass and Ra&#x27;s electronic keyboards provide cohesion.

===New York phase===
After the move to New York, Sun Ra and company plunged headlong into the experimentalism that they had only hinted at in Chicago. The music was often extremely loud and the Arkestra grew to include multiple drummers and percussionists. In recordings of this era, Ra began to use new technologies—such as extensive use of tape delay—to assemble spatial sound pieces, such as &quot;Saturn&quot;, which were far removed from earlier compositions. Recordings and live performances often featured passages for unusual instrumental combinations, and passages of collective playing that incorporated free improvisation. It is often difficult to tell where compositions end and improvisations begin.

In this era, Sun Ra began conducting using hand and body gestures. This system inspired cornetist Butch Morris, who later developed his own more highly refined way to conduct improvisers.

Though often associated with avant-garde jazz, Sun Ra did not believe his work could be classified as &quot;free music&quot;: &quot;I have to make sure that every note, every nuance, is correct... If you want to call it that, spell it &quot;p-h-r-e&quot;, because &quot;ph&quot; is a definite article and &quot;re&quot; is the name of the sun. So I play &quot;phre&quot; music – music of the sun.&quot;

Seeking to broaden his compositional possibilities, Sun Ra insisted all band members double on various percussion instruments – predating world music by drawing on various ethnic musical forms – and most saxophonists became multireedists, adding instruments such as flutes, oboes, or clarinets to their arsenals. In this era, Sun Ra was among the first of any musicians to make extensive and pioneering use of synthesizers and other various electronic keyboards; he was given a prototype Minimoog by its inventor, Robert Moog. According to the Bob Moog Foundation: &quot;Sun Ra first met Robert Moog after &quot;Downbeat&quot; journalist and Sun Ra acquaintance Tam Fiofori arranged for a visit to Moog’s factory in Trumansburg in the Fall of 1969...it was during this visit that Moog loaned Sun Ra a prototype Minimoog (Model B), several months before the commercial instrument (Model D) was introduced in March 1970. Ra immediately added the instrument to his repertoire of keyboards, later acquired a second, and featured the Minimoog prominently on many of his recordings of the early 1970s.&quot;

Notable titles from this period include &quot;The Magic City&quot;, &quot;Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy&quot;, &quot;When Sun Comes Out&quot;, &quot;The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Volume One&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Secrets of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Other Planes of There&quot;.

===Philadelphia phase===
During their third period, beginning around 1976, Sun Ra and the Arkestra settled down into a relatively conventional sound, often incorporating swing standards, although their records and concerts were still highly eclectic and energetic, and typically included at least one lengthy, semi-improvised percussion jam. Sun Ra was explicitly asserting a continuity with the ignored jazz tradition: &quot;They tried to fool you, now I got to school you, about jazz, about jazz&quot; he chanted in concerts, framing the inclusion of pieces by Fletcher Henderson and Jelly Roll Morton.

In the 1970s Sun Ra took a liking to the films of Walt Disney. He incorporated smatterings of Disney musical numbers into many of his performances from then on. In the late 1980s the Arkestra performed a concert at Walt Disney World. The Arkestra&#x27;s version of &quot;Pink Elephants on Parade&quot; is available on &quot;Stay Awake&quot;, a tribute album of Disney tunes played by various artists and produced by Hal Willner. A number of Sun Ra&#x27;s 1970s concerts are available on CD, but none have received a wide release in comparison to his earlier music. In 1978–1980 performances, Sun Ra added a large electronic creation, the Outerspace Visual Communicator, which produced images rather than sounds; this was performed at a keyboard by its inventor, Bill Sebastian. During concerts, the OVC usually was positioned at center stage behind the Arkestra while Sebastian sat on stage with the musicians.

===Musicians===
Dozens of musicians—perhaps hundreds—passed through Sun Ra&#x27;s bands over the years. Some stayed with him for decades, whilst others played on only a few recordings or performances.

Sun Ra was personally responsible for the vast majority of the constant changes in the Arkestra&#x27;s lineup. According to contrabassist Jiunie Booth, a member of the Arkestra, Sun Ra did not confront any musician whose performance he was unsatisfied with. Instead, he would simply gather the entire Arkestra minus the offending musician, and skip town—leaving the fired musician stranded.

===Outer Space Visual Communicator===
The Outer Space Visual Communicator was a giant machine that was played with hands and feet to create light designs, similar to how musicians create and sound with their instruments. The name of the instrument arose from Bill Sebastian&#x27;s collaboration with Sun Ra, who incorporated the OVC into the Arkestra from 1978 to 1980 and experimented on video applications from 1981 to 1987.

==Philosophy==
Sun Ra&#x27;s world view was often described as a philosophy, but he rejected this term, describing his own manner as an &quot;equation&quot; and saying that while philosophy is based on theories and abstract reasoning, his method was based on logic and pragmatism. Many of the Arkestra cite Sun Ra&#x27;s teachings as pivotal in inspiring their long-term devotion to music. His equation was rarely (if ever) explained as a whole; instead, it was related in bits and pieces over many years, leading some to doubt that he had a coherent message. However, Martinelli argues that, when considered as a whole, one can discern a unified world view that draws upon many sources, but is also unique to Sun Ra, writing:

He drew on sources as diverse as the Kabbalah, Rosicrucianism, channeling, numerology, Freemasonry, Ancient Egyptian Mysticism, and Black nationalism. Sun Ra&#x27;s system had distinct Gnostic leanings, arguing that the god of most monotheistic religions was not the creator god, not the ultimate god, but a lesser, evil being. Sun Ra was wary of the Bible, knowing that it had been used to justify slavery. He often rearranged and reworded Biblical passages (and reworked many other words, names, or phrases) in an attempt to uncover &quot;hidden&quot; meanings. The most obvious evidence of this system was Ra&#x27;s practice of renaming many of the musicians who played with him.

Bassoonist/multireedist James Jacson had studied Zen Buddhism before joining Sun Ra and identified strong similarities between Zen teachings and practices (particularly Zen koans) and Ra&#x27;s use of &quot;non sequiturs&quot; and seemingly absurd replies to questions. Drummer Art Jenkins admitted that Sun Ra&#x27;s &quot;nonsense&quot; sometimes troubled his thoughts for days until inspiring a sort of paradigm shift, or profound change in outlook. Drummer Andrew Cyrille said Sun Ra&#x27;s comments were &quot;very interesting stuff... whether you believed it or not. And a lot of times it was humorous, and a lot of times it was ridiculous, and a lot of times it was right on the money.&quot;

Sun Ra&#x27;s philosophy can be further understood in viewing his film &quot;Space is the Place.&quot; The film opens with Sun Ra on a distant planet, where the music and vibrations are much different from Earth where the air is filled with the sounds of &quot;guns, anger and frustration.&quot; A colony is erected on this planet specifically for black people because only on a distant planet will the black race be free to return to their natural vibrations and live in harmony. This will give rise to an &quot;altered destiny.&quot; The film also discloses Sun Ra&#x27;s ideas on how to get his people to another planet. This can be accomplished through, &quot;isotopic teleportation, trans-molecularization, or better still – teleport the whole planet here through music.&quot;

===Sun Ra and black culture===
According to Szwed, Sun Ra&#x27;s view of his relationship to black people and black cultures &quot;changed drastically&quot; over time. Initially, Sun Ra identified closely with broader struggles for black power, black political influence, and black identity, and saw his own music as a key element in educating and liberating blacks. But by the heyday of Black Power radicalism in the 1960s, Sun Ra was expressing disillusionment with these aims. He denied feeling closely connected to any race. In 1970 he said:

I couldn&#x27;t approach black people with the truth because they like lies. They live lies... At one time I felt that white people were to blame for everything, but then I found out that they were just puppets and pawns of some greater force, which has been using them... Some force is having a good time [manipulating black and white people] and looking, enjoying itself up in a reserved seat, wondering, &quot;I wonder when they&#x27;re going to wake up.&quot;

====Afrofuturism====
Sun Ra is considered to be an early pioneer of the Afrofuturism movement due to his music, writings and other works.

The influence of Sun Ra can be seen throughout many aspects of black music. He grounded his practice of Afrofuturism in a musical tradition that has been described as ‘performing blackness’’. Sun Ra lived out his beliefs of Afrofuturism in his daily life by embodying the movement not only in his music, but also in his clothes and actions. This embodiment of the narrative allowed him to demonstrate black nationalism as a counternarrative to the contemporary culture.

It was in Chicago, as well, in the mid-fifties, that Ra began experimenting with extraterrestriality in his stage show, sometimes playing regular cocktail lounges dressed in space suits and ancient Egyptian regalia. By placing his band and performances in space and extraterrestrial environments Sun Ra built a world that was his own view of how the African diaspora connected.

==Influence and legacy==
Many of Sun Ra&#x27;s innovations remain important and groundbreaking. Ra was one of the first jazz leaders to use two double basses, to employ the electric bass, to play electronic keyboards, to use extensive percussion and polyrhythms, to explore modal music and to pioneer solo and group freeform improvisations. In addition, he made his mark in the wider cultural context: he proclaimed the African origins of jazz, reaffirmed pride in black history and reasserted the spiritual and mystical dimensions of music, all important factors in the black cultural/political renaissance of the 1960s.

NRBQ recorded &quot;Rocket #9&quot; in 1968 for their debut album on Columbia. Sun Ra had given NRBQ&#x27;s Terry Adams a copy of the song on 45 and told him, &quot;This is especially for you,&quot; which Adams reported inspired him to reform the band after a period of inactivity. The band still includes Sun Ra&#x27;s compositions in their performances, and besides &quot;Rocket #9&quot; have released recordings of &quot;We Travel the Spaceways&quot; and &quot;Love in Outer Space.&quot; Several members of the Arkestra have toured with NRBQ over the years, including Pat Patrick, Marshall Allen, Knoel Scott, Tyrone Hill and Danny Thompson. Adams has joined the Arkestra as their pianist on several tours, most recently during a February 2016 tour of cities in the US southeast.

Detroit&#x27;s MC5 played a handful of shows with Sun Ra and were influenced by his works immensely. One of their songs from their premiere album &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; (1969) featured a track called &quot;Starship&quot;, which was based on a poem by Ra.

Sun Ra was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame in 1979.

The &quot;Sun Ra Repatriation Project&quot; was started in 2008 with the aim of using interplanetary communication with a view to facilitating Sun Ra&#x27;s return to planet Earth.

Filmmaker and visual artist Cauleen Smith has heavily researched the life and legacy of Sun Ra. Her 2013 exhibition &quot;17&quot; &quot;arises out of [her] research into the legacy of Sun Ra, who was himself a student of numerology and achieved a kind of cultural immortality the number 17 might be said to refer to&quot;. Her project &quot;The Solar Flare Arkestral Marching Band&quot; includes several components related to Sun Ra. &quot;One component (2010) of the project is the production of five flash mob street performances involving a marching band inspired by Sun Ra&#x27;s Arkestra. The second component of the project... is a full-length video that chronicles the urban legends of Sun Ra’s time in Chicago as well as the contemporary artists who live and work in this city&quot;.

The &quot;Sun Ra Revival Post-Krautrock Archestra&quot;, formed in Australia during 2014, paid tribute to Sun Ra&#x27;s philosophies and musical ideas within their albums &quot;Realm Beyond Realm&quot; and &quot;Sun Ra Kills the World&quot;.

The Spatial AKA Orchestra, formed in 2006 by Jerry Dammers (the main songwriter of British ska revival band The Specials), was originally created as a tribute to Sun Ra, borrowing many of the ideas, themes and tropes from Sun Ra&#x27;s own performances.

In 2022, a building at 5626 Morton Street known as the Arkestral Institute of Sun Ra was listed as a historic landmark in the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places. One of its inhabitants, Marshall Allen, known for his work with The Sun Ra Arkestra, began living there in 1968.

The University of Chicago has an extensive collection of Sun Ra&#x27;s works and personal items in the Special Collections Research Center at the Regenstein Library. The collection was assembled by Ra&#x27;s business manager Alton Abraham and is open to the public upon request. The Special Collections Research Center has also repeatedly exhibited Sun Ra&#x27;s work.

==Discography==
==Filmography==
&quot;Space Is the Place&quot; (1974) is a feature-length film that stars Sun Ra and his band as themselves. The soundtrack, also by Sun Ra, is available on CD. The film follows Sun Ra after he returns to Chicago from many years of space travel with his Arkestra. In a meeting with &quot;the Overseer&quot; – a devil-like figure stationed in the desert – Sun Ra agrees to play a game of cards to &quot;win&quot; the black community. Sun Ra&#x27;s goal is to transport the American black community to a new planet he discovered while on his journey, and that he hopes to use as a home for an entirely black population. The artist&#x27;s mission is to &quot;teleport the whole planet through music&quot;, but his attempts are often misunderstood by his supposed converts.

Sun Ra and his Arkestra were the subject of a few documentary films, including Robert Mugge&#x27;s &quot;Sun Ra: A Joyful Noise&quot; (1980). It interspersed passages of performances and rehearsals with Sun Ra&#x27;s commentary on various subjects ranging from today&#x27;s youth to his own place in the cosmos. More recently, Don Letts&#x27; &quot;Sun Ra – Brother from Another Planet&quot; (2005) incorporated some of Mugge&#x27;s material, and includes some additional interviews. &quot;Points on a Space Age&quot; (2009) is a documentary by Ephrahaim Asili. &quot;It&#x27;s a 60-minute doc along the lines of the talking-head-intercut-with performance clips style.&quot;

==Bibliography==
Sun Ra wrote an enormous number of songs and material regarding his spiritual beliefs and music. A magazine titled &quot;Sun Ra Research&quot; was published irregularly for many years, providing extensive documentation of Sun Ra&#x27;s perspectives on many issues. Sun Ra&#x27;s collected poetry and prose is available as a book, published May 2005, entitled &quot;Sun Ra, The Immeasurable Equation&quot;. Another book of over 260 of Sun Ra&#x27;s poems, &quot;Sun Ra: Collected Works Vol. 1: Immeasurable Equation&quot; was published by Phaelos Books in November 2005. &quot;The Wisdom of Sun Ra: Sun Ra&#x27;s Polemical Broadsheets and Streetcorner Leaflets&quot;, was published in book form in 2005, by WhiteWalls. A collection of Sun Ra&#x27;s poetry, &quot;This Planet Is Doomed&quot;, was published by Kicks Books in 2011.

<doc id="97584" wikidata="Q520188" url="?curid=97584" title="Nammu">
<text>Nammu ( dENGUR = dLAGAB×ḪAL; also read Namma) was a Mesopotamian goddess regarded as a creator deity in the local theology of Eridu. It is assumed that she was associated with water. She is also well attested in connection with incantations and apotropaic magic. She was regarded as the mother of Enki, and in a single inscription she appears as the wife of Anu, but it is assumed that she usually was not believed to have a spouse. From the Old Babylonian period onwards, she was considered to be the mother of An (Heaven) and Ki (Earth), as well as a representation of the primeval sea/ocean, an association that may have come from influence from the goddess Tiamat.

While Nammu is already attested in sources from the Early Dynastic period, such as the &quot;zame&quot; hymns and an inscription of Lugal-kisalsi, she was not commonly worshiped. A temple dedicated to her existed in Ur in the Old Babylonian period, she is also attested in texts from Nippur and Babylon. Theophoric names invoking her were rare, with that of king Ur-Nammu until recently being believed to be the only example.

In the Old Babylonian myth &quot;Enki and Ninmah&quot;, Nammu is one of the deities involved in the creation of mankind alongside the eponymous pair and a group of seven minor goddesses. Her presence differentiates this narrative from other texts dealing with the same motif, such as &quot;Atra-Hasis&quot;.

==Name and epithets==
Nammu&#x27;s name was represented in cuneiform by the Sumerogram ENGUR (LAGAB×ḪAL). Lexical lists provide evidence for multiple readings, including Nammu, Namma and longer, reduplicated variants such as Namnamu and Nannama. A bilingual text from Tell Harmal treats the short and long forms of the name as if they were respectively the Akkadian and Sumerian versions of the same word. The name is conventionally translated as &quot;creatrix.&quot; This interpretation depends on the theory that it is etymologically related to the element &quot;imma&quot; (SIG7) in the name of the goddess Ninimma, which could be explained in Akkadian as &quot;nabnītu&quot; or &quot;bunnannû&quot;, two terms pertaining to creation. However, this proposal is not universally accepted. Another related possibility is to interpret it as a genitive compound, &quot;(e)n + amma(k)&quot;, &quot;lady of the cosmic river,&quot; but it is similarly not free of criticism, and it has been argued no clear evidence for the etymology for Nammu&#x27;s name exists. Ancient authors secondarily etymologized it as &quot;nig2-nam-ma&quot;, &quot;creativity&quot;, &quot;totality&quot; or &quot;everything&quot;. 

The sign ENGUR could also be read as &quot;engur&quot;, a synonym of &quot;apsu&quot;, but when used in this context, it was not identical with the name of the goddess, and Nammu could be referred to as the creator of &quot;engur&quot;, which according to Frans Wiggermann confirms she and the mythical body of water were not identical. 

Nammu could be referred to with epithets such as &quot;lady who is great and high in the sea&quot; (&quot;nin-ab-gal-an-na-u5-a&quot;), &quot;mother who gave birth to heaven and earth&quot; (&quot;dama-tu-an-ki&quot;) or &quot;first mother who gave birth to all (or senior) gods&quot; (&quot;ama-palil-u3-tu-diĝir-šar-šar-ra-ke4-ne&quot;). The motherhood of Nammu to heaven and earth is attested in texts like the god-list TCL XV 10 and is related to the status attained from the Old Babylonian period onwards as the mother of An (Heaven) and Ki (Earth).

==Character==
Few sources providing information about Nammu&#x27;s character are known. Most of them come from the Old Babylonian period. Based on indirect evidence it is assumed she was associated with water, though there is debate among researchers over whether sweet or saline. No explicit references to Nammu being identical with the sea are known, and Manuel Ceccarelli in a recent study suggests she might have represented groundwater. Jan Lisman, who views Nammu as having been a representation of the primordial ocean/sea from which the rest of the cosmos emerged, believes that Nammu&#x27;s association with this body of water may have come from the influence of the goddess Tiamat.

In the local tradition of Eridu, Nammu was regarded as a creator deity. There is no indication in known texts that she had a spouse when portrayed as such. Julia M. Asher-Greve suggests that while generally treated as a goddess, Nammu can be considered asexual in this context. Joan Goodnick Westenholz assumed the process of creation she was involved in was imagined as comparable to parthenogenesis. While primordial figures were often considered to no longer be active by the ancient Mesopotamians, in contrast with other deities, Nammu was apparently believed to still exist as an active figure. 

Nammu was also associated with incantations, apotropaic magic and tools and materials used in them. In a single incantation she is called &quot;bēlet egubbê&quot;, &quot;mistress of the holy water basin&quot;, but this epithet was usually regarded as belonging to Ningirima, rather than her. In texts of this genre, she could be invoked in order to purificate or consecrate something, or against demons, illness or scorpions. 

==Associations with other deities==
Nammu was regarded as the mother of Enki (Ea), as indicated by the myth &quot;Enki and Ninmah&quot;, the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot; and a bilingual incantation. However, references to her being his sole parent are less common than the well attested tradition according to which he was one of the children of Anu. Julia Krul assumes that in the third millennium BCE Nammu was regarded as the spouse of the latter god. She is designated this way in an inscription of Lugal-kisalsi from the Early Dynastic period. However, this is the only known reference to the existence of such a tradition. Wilfred G. Lambert concluded that Nammu had no traditional spouse.

In incantations, Nammu could appear alongside deities such as Enki, Asalluhi and Nanshe. An early literary text known from a copy from Ebla mentions a grouping of deities presumed to share judiciary functions which includes Nammu, Shamash, Ishtaran and Idlurugu.

A single explanatory text equates Nammu with Apsu. It seemingly reinterprets her as a male deity and as the spouse of Nanshe. However, it most likely depends on traditions pertaining to &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot; and does not represent a separate independent tradition. As of 2017, no clear evidence for the belief in personified Apsu predating the composition of this text was known. Additionally, while the presumed theogony focused on Nammu is the closest possible parallel to Tiamat&#x27;s role in &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot;, according to Manuel Ceccarelli the two were not closely connected. In particular, there is no evidence Nammu was ever regarded as an antagonistic figure.

==Worship==
Evidence for the worship of Nammu is scarce in all periods it is attested in. She belonged to the local pantheon of Eridu, and could be referred to as the divine mother of this city. The only indication of an association with a local pantheon other than that of Eridu is the epithet assigned to her in the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot; (tablet I, line 27), munusagrig-zi-é-kur-(ra-)ke4, &quot;true housekeeper of Ekur&quot;, but it might have only been assigned to her due to confusion with similarly named Ninimma, who was a member of Enlil&#x27;s court. The Early Dynastics &quot;zame&quot; hymns assign a separate settlement to her, but the reading of its name remains uncertain. Lugal-kisalsi, a king of Uruk, built a temple dedicated to her, but its ceremonial name is not known. An inscription dated to around 2400-2250 BCE commemorates this event:

In the Ur III period, Nammu is attested in various incantations invoking deities associated with Eridu. She received offerings in Ur in the Old Babylonian period, and texts from this location mention the existence of a temple and clergy (including &quot;gudu4&quot; priests) dedicated to her, as well as a field named after her. She also appears in the contemporary god list from Nippur as the 107th entry.

According to Frans Wiggermann, a &quot;kudurru&quot; (inscribed boundary stone) inscription indicates that a temple of Nammu existed in the Sealand at least since the reign of Gulkišar, that it remained in use during the reign of Enlil-nadin-apli of the Second Dynasty of Isin, and that its staff included a &quot;šangû&quot; priest. The latter king also invoked her alongside Nanshe in a blessing formula. A dedicatory inscription from the Kassite period which mentions Nammu is also known, though its point of origin remains uncertain. Based on a document most likely written during the reign of Esarhaddon, Nammu was also worshiped in &quot;É&quot;-DÚR-&quot;gi-na&quot;, the temple of Lugal-asal in Bāṣ.

Shrines named &quot;kius-Namma&quot;, &quot;footstep of Nammu&quot;, existed in Ekur in Nippur and in Esagil in Babylon. Andrew R. George suggests that the latter, attested in a source from the reign of Nabonidus, was named after the former.

It is assumed that Nammu was not a popular deity. As of 1998, the only known example of a theophoric name invoking Nammu was that of king Ur-Nammu. Further studies identified no other names invoking her in sources from the Ur III period. However, two further examples have been identified in a more recent survey of texts from Kassite Nippur.

Texts dealing with the study of calendars (hemerologies) indicate that the twenty seventh day of the month could be regarded as a festival of Nammu and Nergal, and prescribe royal offerings to these two deities during it.

==Mythology==
Nammu appears in the myth &quot;Enki and Ninmah&quot;. While the text comes from Old Babylonian period, it might reflect an older tradition from the Ur III period. Two complete copies most likely postdating the reign of Samsu-iluna are known, in addition to a bilingual Sumero-Akkadian version from the library of Ashurbanipal. In the beginning of the composition, Nammu wakes up her son Enki to inform him that other gods are complaining about the heavy tasks assigned to them. As a solution, he suggests the creation of mankind, and instructs Nammu how to form men from clay with the help of Ninmah and her assistants (Ninimma, Shuzianna, Ninmada, Ninšar, Ninmug, Mumudu and Ninnigina according to Wilfred G. Lambert&#x27;s translation). After the task is finished, Enki prepares a banquet for Nammu and Ninmah, which other deities, such as Anu, Enlil and the seven assistants, also attend. Nammu&#x27;s presence sets the account of creation of mankind in this myth from other compositions dealing with the same topic, such as &quot;Atra-Hasis&quot;.

<text>A citation is a reference to a source. More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears.

Generally, the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not).

Citations have several important purposes. While their uses for upholding intellectual honesty and bolstering claims are typically foregrounded in teaching materials and style guides (e.g.,), correct attribution of insights to previous sources is just one of these purposes. Linguistic analysis of citation-practices has indicated that they also serve critical roles in orchestrating the state of knowledge on a particular topic, identifying gaps in the existing knowledge that should be filled or describing areas where inquiries should be continued or replicated. Citation has also been identified as a critical means by which researchers establish stance: aligning themselves with or against subgroups of fellow researchers working on similar projects and staking out opportunities for creating new knowledge.

Conventions of citation (e.g., placement of dates within parentheses, superscripted endnotes vs. footnotes, colons or commas for page numbers, etc.) vary by the citation-system used (e.g., Oxford, Harvard, MLA, NLM, American Sociological Association (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), etc.). Each system is associated with different academic disciplines, and academic journals associated with these disciplines maintain the relevant citational style by recommending and adhering to the relevant style guides.

== Concept ==
A &quot;bibliographic citation&quot; is a reference to a book, article, web page, or other published item. Citations should supply sufficient detail to identify the item uniquely. Different citation systems and styles are used in scientific citation, legal citation, prior art, the arts, and the humanities. Regarding the use of citations in the scientific literature, some scholars also put forward &quot;the right to refuse unwanted citations&quot; in certain situations deemed inappropriate.

== Content ==
Citation content can vary depending on the type of source and may include:
* &quot;Book:&quot; authors, book title, place of publication, publisher, date of publication, and page numbers if appropriate.
* &quot;Journal:&quot; authors, article title, journal title, date of publication, and page numbers.
* &quot;Newspaper:&quot; authors, article title, name of newspaper, section title and page numbers if desired, date of publication.
* &quot;Web site:&quot; authors, article, and publication title where appropriate, as well as a URL, and a date when the site was accessed.
* &quot;Play:&quot; inline citations offer part, scene, and line numbers, the latter separated by periods: 4.452 refers to scene 4, line 452. For example, &quot;In Eugene Onegin, Onegin rejects Tanya when she is free to be his, and only decides he wants her when she is already married&quot; (Pushkin 4.452–53).
* &quot;Poem:&quot; spaced slashes are normally used to indicate separate lines of a poem, and parenthetical citations usually include the line numbers. For example: &quot;For I must love because I live / And life in me is what you give.&quot; (Brennan, lines 15–16).
* &quot;Interview:&quot; name of interviewer, interview descriptor (ex. personal interview), and date of interview.
* &quot;Data:&quot; authors, dataset title, date of publication, and publisher.

=== Unique identifiers ===
Along with information such as authors, date of publication, title and page numbers, citations may also include unique identifiers depending on the type of work being referred to.
* Citations of books may include an International Standard Book Number (ISBN).
* Specific volumes, articles, or other identifiable parts of a periodical, may have an associated Serial Item and Contribution Identifier (SICI) or an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN).
* Electronic documents may have a digital object identifier (DOI).
* Biomedical research articles may have a PubMed Identifier (PMID).

== Systems ==
Broadly speaking, there are two types of citation systems, the Vancouver system and parenthetical referencing. However, the Council of Science Editors (CSE) adds a third, the&quot; citation-name system&quot;.

=== Vancouver system ===

The Vancouver system uses sequential numbers in the text, either bracketed or superscript or both. The numbers refer to either footnotes (notes at the end of the page) or endnotes (notes on a page at the end of the paper) that provide source detail. The notes system may or may not require a full bibliography, depending on whether the writer has used a full-note form or a shortened-note form. The organizational logic of the bibliography is that sources are listed in their order of appearance in-text, rather than alphabetically by author last name.

For example, an excerpt from the text of a paper using a notes system &quot;without&quot; a full bibliography could look like:

:&quot;The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.&quot;1

The note, located either at the foot of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) would look like this:

:1. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, &quot;On Death and Dying&quot; (New York: Macmillan, 1969) 45–60.

In a paper with a full bibliography, the shortened note might look like:

:1. Kübler-Ross, &quot;On Death and Dying&quot; 45–60.

The bibliography entry, which is required with a shortened note, would look like this:

:Kübler-Ross, Elisabeth. &quot;On Death and Dying&quot;. New York: Macmillan, 1969.

In the humanities, many authors also use footnotes or endnotes to supply anecdotal information. In this way, what looks like a citation is actually supplementary material, or suggestions for further reading.

=== Parenthetical referencing ===

Parenthetical referencing, also known as Harvard referencing, has full or partial, in-text, citations enclosed in circular brackets and embedded in the paragraph.

An example of a parenthetical reference:
:&quot;The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance&quot; (Kübler-Ross, 1969, pp. 45–60).

Depending on the choice of style, fully cited parenthetical references may require no end section. Other styles include a list of the citations, with complete bibliographical references, in an end section, sorted alphabetically by author. This section is often called &quot;References&quot;, &quot;Bibliography&quot;, &quot;Works cited&quot; or &quot;Works consulted&quot;.

In-text references for online publications may differ from conventional parenthetical referencing. A full reference can be hidden, only displayed when wanted by the reader, in the form of a tooltip. This style makes citing easier and improves the reader&#x27;s experience.

== Styles ==

Citation styles can be broadly divided into styles common to the humanities and the sciences, though there is considerable overlap. Some style guides, such as the Chicago Manual of Style, are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as MLA and APA styles, specify formats within the context of a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles. The various guides thus specify order of appearance, for example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.

A number of organizations have created styles to fit their needs; consequently, a number of different guides exist. Individual publishers often have their own in-house variations as well, and some works are so long-established as to have their own citation methods too: Stephanus pagination for Plato; Bekker numbers for Aristotle; citing the Bible by book, chapter and verse; or Shakespeare notation by play.

The Citation Style Language (CSL) is an open XML-based language to describe the formatting of citations and bibliographies.

=== Humanities ===
* The Chicago style (CMOS) was developed and its guide is &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;. It is most widely used in history and economics as well as some social sciences. The closely related Turabian style—which derives from it—is for student references, and is distinguished from the CMOS by omission of quotation marks in reference lists, and mandatory access date citation.
* The Columbia style was created by Janice R. Walker and Todd Taylor to give detailed guidelines for citing internet sources. Columbia style offers models for both the humanities and the sciences.
* &quot;Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace&quot; by Elizabeth Shown Mills covers primary sources not included in CMOS, such as censuses, court, land, government, business, and church records. Includes sources in electronic format. Used by genealogists and historians.
* Harvard referencing (or author-date system) is a specific kind of parenthetical referencing. Parenthetical referencing is recommended by both the British Standards Institution and the Modern Language Association. Harvard referencing involves a short author-date reference, e.g., &quot;(Smith, 2000)&quot;, being inserted after the cited text within parentheses and the full reference to the source being listed at the end of the article.
* MLA style was developed by the Modern Language Association and is most often used in the arts and the humanities, particularly in English studies, other literary studies, including comparative literature and literary criticism in languages other than English (&quot;foreign languages&quot;), and some interdisciplinary studies, such as cultural studies, drama and theatre, film, and other media, including television. This style of citations and bibliographical format uses parenthetical referencing with author-page (Smith 395) or author-[short] title-page (Smith, &quot;Contingencies&quot; 42) in the case of more than one work by the same author within parentheses in the text, keyed to an alphabetical list of sources on a &quot;works cited&quot; page at the end of the paper, as well as notes (footnotes or endnotes).
* The MHRA Style Guide is published by the Modern Humanities Research Association (MHRA) and most widely used in the arts and humanities in the United Kingdom, where the MHRA is based. It is available for sale both in the UK and in the United States. It is similar to MLA style, but has some differences. For example, MHRA style uses footnotes that reference a citation fully while also providing a bibliography. Some readers find it advantageous that the footnotes provide full citations, instead of shortened references, so that they do not need to consult the bibliography while reading for the rest of the publication details.

In some areas of the humanities, footnotes are used exclusively for references, and their use for conventional footnotes (explanations or examples) is avoided. In these areas, the term &quot;footnote&quot; is actually used as a synonym for &quot;reference&quot;, and care must be taken by editors and typesetters to ensure that they understand how the term is being used by their authors.

=== Law ===

* The Bluebook is a citation system traditionally used in American academic legal writing, and the Bluebook (or similar systems derived from it) are used by many courts. At present, academic legal articles are always footnoted, but motions submitted to courts and court opinions traditionally use inline citations, which are either separate sentences or separate clauses. Inline citations allow readers to quickly determine the strength of a source based on, for example, the court a case was decided in and the year it was decided.
* The legal citation style used almost universally in Canada is based on the &quot;Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation&quot; (AKA &quot;McGill Guide&quot;), published by &quot;McGill Law Journal&quot;.
* British legal citation almost universally follows the &quot;Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities&quot; (OSCOLA).

=== Sciences, mathematics, engineering, physiology, and medicine ===
* The American Chemical Society style, or ACS style, is often used in chemistry and some of the physical sciences. In ACS style references are numbered in the text and in the reference list, and numbers are repeated throughout the text as needed.
* In the style of the American Institute of Physics (AIP style), references are also numbered in the text and in the reference list, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.
* Styles developed for the American Mathematical Society (AMS), or AMS styles, such as AMS-LaTeX, are typically implemented using the BibTeX tool in the LaTeX typesetting environment. Brackets with the author&#x27;s initials and year are inserted in the text and at the beginning of the reference. Typical citations are listed in line with alphabetic-label format, e.g. [AB90]. This type of style is also called an &quot;authorship trigraph&quot;.
* The Vancouver system, recommended by the Council of Science Editors (CSE), is used in medical and scientific papers and research.
** In one major variant, that used by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), citation numbers are included in the text in square brackets rather than as superscripts. All bibliographical information is exclusively included in the list of references at the end of the document, next to the respective citation number.
** The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) is reportedly the original kernel of this biomedical style, which evolved from the Vancouver 1978 editors&#x27; meeting. The MEDLINE/PubMed database uses this citation style and the National Library of Medicine provides &quot;ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals – Sample References&quot;.
* The American Medical Association has its own variant of Vancouver style with only minor differences. See AMA Manual of Style.
* The style of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), or IEEE style, encloses citation numbers within square brackets and numbers them consecutively, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.
* In areas of biology that falls within the ICNafp (which itself uses this citation style throughout), a variant form of author-title citation is the primary method used when making nomenclatural citations and sometimes general citations (for example in code-related proposals published in &quot;Taxon&quot;), with the works in question not cited in the bibliography unless also cited in the text. Titles use standardized abbreviations following &quot;Botanico-Periodicum-Huntianum&quot; for periodicals and &quot;Taxonomic Literature 2&quot; (later IPNI) for books.
* Pechenik citation style is a style described in &quot;A Short Guide to Writing about Biology&quot;, 6th ed. (2007), by Jan A. Pechenik.
* In 1955, Eugene Garfield proposed a bibliographic system for scientific literature, to consolidate the integrity of scientific publications.

=== Social sciences ===
* The style of the American Psychological Association, or APA style, published in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, is most often used in social sciences. APA citation style is similar to Harvard referencing, listing the author&#x27;s name and year of publication, although these can take two forms: &quot;name citations&quot; in which the surnames of the authors appear in the text and the year of publication then appears in parentheses, and &quot;author-date citations&quot;, in which the surnames of the authors and the year of publication all appear in parentheses. In both cases, in-text citations point to an alphabetical list of sources at the end of the paper in a &quot;references&quot; section.
* The American Political Science Association publishes both a style manual and a style guide for publications in this field. The style is close to the CMOS.
* The American Anthropological Association utilizes a modified form of the Chicago style laid out in their publishing style guide.
* The ASA style of the American Sociological Association is one of the main styles used in sociological publications.

== Issues ==
In their research on footnotes in scholarly journals in the field of communication, Michael Bugeja and Daniela V. Dimitrova have found that citations to online sources have a rate of decay (as cited pages are taken down), which they call a &quot;half-life&quot;, that renders footnotes in those journals less useful for scholarship over time.

Other experts have found that published replications do not have as many citations as original publications.

Another important issue is citation errors, which often occur due to carelessness on either the researcher or journal editor&#x27;s part in the publication procedure. For example, a study that analyzed 1,200 randomly selected citations from three major business ethics journals concluded that an average article contains at least three plagiarized citations when authors copy and paste a citation entry from another publication without consulting the original source. Experts have found that simple precautions, such as consulting the author of a cited source about proper citations, reduce the likelihood of citation errors and thus increase the quality of research. Another study noted that approximately 25% citations do not support the claims made, a finding that affects many disciplines, including history.

Research suggests the impact of an article can be, partly, explained by superficial factors and not only by the scientific merits of an article. Field-dependent factors are usually listed as an issue to be tackled not only when comparisons across disciplines are made, but also when different fields of research of one discipline are being compared. For example, in medicine, among other factors, the number of authors, the number of references, the article length, and the presence of a colon in the title influence the impact; while in sociology the number of references, the article length, and title length are among the factors.

Studies of methodological quality and reliability have found that &quot;reliability of published research works in several fields may be decreasing with increasing journal rank&quot;. Nature Index recognizes that citations remain a controversial and yet important metric for academics. They report five ways to increase citation counts: (1) watch the title length and punctuation; (2) release the results early as preprints; (3) avoid referring to a country in the title, abstract, or keywords; (4) link the article to supporting data in a repository; and (5) avoid hyphens in the titles of research articles.

Citation patterns are also known to be affected by unethical behavior of both the authors and journal staff. Such behavior is called impact factor boosting and was reported to involve even the top-tier journals. Specifically the high-ranking journals of medical science, including &quot;The Lancet&quot;, &quot;JAMA&quot; and &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, are thought to be associated with such behavior, with up to 30% of citations to these journals being generated by commissioned opinion articles. On the other hand, the phenomenon of citation cartels is rising. Citation cartels are defined as groups of authors that cite each other disproportionately more than they do other groups of authors who work on the same subject.

==Research and development==
There is research about citations and development of related tools and systems, mainly relating to scientific citations. Citation analysis is a method widely used in metascience.

<text>Shamash (Akkadian: &quot;šamaš&quot;), also known as Utu (Sumerian: dutu &quot;Sun&quot;) was the ancient Mesopotamian sun god. He was believed to see everything that happened in the world every day, and was therefore responsible for justice and protection of travelers. As a divine judge, he could be associated with the underworld. Additionally, he could serve as the god of divination, typically alongside the weather god Adad. While he was universally regarded as one of the primary gods, he was particularly venerated in Sippar and Larsa. The moon god Nanna (Sin) and his wife Ningal were regarded as his parents, while his twin sister was Inanna (Ishtar). Occasionally other goddesses, such as Manzat and Pinikir, could be regarded as his sisters too. The dawn goddess Aya (Sherida) was his wife, and multiple texts describe their daily reunions taking place on a mountain where the sun was believed to set. Among their children were Kittum, the personification of truth, dream deities such as Mamu, as well as the god Ishum. Utu&#x27;s name could be used to write the names of many foreign solar deities logographically. The connection between him and the Hurrian solar god Shimige is particularly well attested, and the latter could be associated with Aya as well.

While no myths focusing on Utu are known, he often appears as an ally of other figures in both Sumerian and Akkadian compositions. According to narratives about Dumuzi&#x27;s death, he helped protect him when the &quot;galla&quot; demons tried to drag him to the underworld. In various versions of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; and in earlier Gilgamesh myths, he helps this hero defeat the monstrous Humbaba. In the myth &quot;Inanna and An&quot;, he helps his sister acquire the temple Eanna. In &quot;How Grain Came to Sumer&quot;, he is invoked to advise Ninazu and Ninmada.

==Name==
The two most common names of the sun god used in Mesopotamian texts are Sumerian Utu and Akkadian Shamash. A further relatively commonly attested name is Amna, whose origin is uncertain.

The name Shamash is a cognate of Akkadian terms &quot;šamšu&quot; (&quot;sun&quot;) and &quot;šamšatu&quot; (&quot;solar disc&quot;), as well as the words referring to sun in other Semitic languages, such as Arabic &quot;šams&quot; and Hebrew &quot;šemeš&quot;. The linguistic connection between the name of the god and the corresponding celestial body has been compared to that between Adad (and Syrian Hadad) and the word &quot;addu&quot;, &quot;storm.&quot; The Amorite form of the name is Samsu, as attested for example in the theophoric name Samsu-iluna (&quot;Samsu is our god&quot;). The ancient Aramaic form of the name was most likely Śameš, though many variant syllabic spellings are attested. Additionally, the name for the sun in Mandaean cosmology, Shamish (Mandaic language:), is derived from Akkadian Shamash.

Utu was understood as a masculine deity. According to Manfred Krebernik, this most likely also resulted in his Akkadian counterpart being viewed as such, even though in the majority of Semitic languages both the word referring to the sun itself and names of solar deities are grammatically feminine. Julia M. Asher-Greve considers this the oldest attested example of a Mesopotamian deity&#x27;s gender being impacted by syncretism. However, not all researchers agree with the assumption that the name Shamash was ever understood as referring to a female deity in Akkadian-speaking areas. Christopher Woods argues that the only available evidence are early ambiguous theophoric names, which according to him do not necessarily point at the existence of female Shamash, and might omit prepositions necessary to identify the gender of the deity invoked in them. Manfred Krebernik notes that a well known example of a female deity in what he deems the &quot;cuneiform cultural sphere&quot; is Shapash. At the same time, both the Amorites and the Arameans viewed the solar deity as male, like Sumerians and Akkadians.

According to Manfred Krebernik, the name Amna, attested as a synonym of Utu in the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot; and used to refer to the sun god in an inscription of Nabonidus, might be either connected to the toponym Sippar-Amnanum or to a root attested in Northwest Semitic languages, &quot;&#x27;-m-n&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;to be reliable&quot; or &quot;to be firm.&quot;

The most common writing of the sun god&#x27;s name was the logogram dUTU, which could be read as Utu, Shamash, or, as attested in the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;, as Amna. Syllabic spellings of all three of these names are also known. A further logographic spelling used the numeral 20, which was associated with him. Dozens of other variant names, epithets or possibly minor deities who came to be seen as synonymous with Utu are attested in god lists. Examples include Karkara (possibly related to Ninkar, one of the names of his wife Aya), Nimindu (possibly related to the name of the goddess Nimintabba), Si&#x27;e (&quot;who shines forth&quot;), Ṣalam (possibly a name referring to a winged sun symbol) and U&#x27;e (&quot;sunrise&quot;).

==Character==
The sun god was one of the principal deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon. In the Early Dynastic god list from Fara, he is the sixth among the deities listed, after Anu, Enlil, Inanna, Enki and Nanna. In later god lists, for example in &quot;An = Anum&quot;, he and his circle appears between Nanna (Sin) and Ishkur (Adad). The Old Babylonian Nippur god list instead places him between Ishkur and Ninurta. Despite Utu&#x27;s typical high status, it is agreed that the role of the sun and deities representing it in Mesopotamian religion was not comparable to that known from ancient Egyptian religion. Based on the attestations of theophoric names such as Shamash-bel-ili (Akkadian: &quot;Shamash is the lord of the gods&quot;), Shamash-Enlil-ili (&quot;Shamash is the Enlil of the gods&quot;) and Shamash-ashared-ili (&quot;Shamash is the foremost of the gods&quot;), Wilfred G. Lambert proposed that a tradition in which he was the supreme god of the pantheon did exist, but never found official support and its spread was limited to the clergy in Sippar and to a smaller degree Larsa.

Common epithets characterize Utu as a &quot;youth&quot; (Sumerian &quot;šul&quot;, Akkadian &quot;eṭlu&quot;) and &quot;hero&quot; (Sumerian &quot;ursaĝ&quot;, Akkadian &quot;qarrādu&quot;). As a representation of the sun, he was believed to travel every day through the sky from east to west, and at night in the opposite direction through AN.ŠAG4, a &quot;nether sky&quot; located directly above the underworld, though the notion of a night journey only developed later, and in sources from the third millennium BCE Utu usually rests at night. A reference to the latter tradition is also known from the &quot;Standard Babylonian&quot; version of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, where Shamash meets with his wife Aya after sunset. Utu&#x27;s vehicle was a solar chariot, which was pulled by four animals bearing the Sumerian names Uhegalanna (&quot;the abundant light of heaven&quot;), Uhushgalanna (&quot;the terrifying great light of heaven&quot;), Usurmurgalanna (&quot;the dreadful great light of heaven&quot;) and Unirgalanna (&quot;the noble light of heaven&quot;). Their species is not entirely consistent, though in most cases the sun chariot is apparently associated with equids: &quot;choice steeds&quot; (&quot;niskum&quot;) in an inscription of Gudea, horses in various prayers and incantations, and mules in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. Manfred Krebernik argues that in early sources, his chariot was drawn by lions, but this has been questioned by Marco Bonechi. Nathan Wasserman in his translation of a fragment of a hymn to Utu mentioning the animals only refers to them as &quot;beasts.&quot; Sunrise and sunset were described as the sun god passing through cosmic gates situated on twin mountains on the opposite ends of the world. It was believed that his daily journey let him see everything happening on earth. He was also responsible for protection of travelers. Formulas common in both prayers and literary compositions indicate that he was likely often invoked outside temples, presumably as an astral body. Early morning was likely regarded as the most appropriate time for imploring him for help.

Utu was also the primary god of justice, presumably because due to traveling through the sky every day he was believed to see everything that happened in the world. He could be assisted in this role by his father Nanna, his sister Inanna, and various minor judge deities. At least in the third millennium BCE, Ishtaran was regarded as a divine judge equal in rank to Utu, and a fragment of a myth from Ebla mentions a divine tribunal in which they both partake alongside Idlurugu (dÍD), a river god also known for his association with justice and judgment who represented ordeal by water. A hymn to Utu states that Idlurugu cannot give judgment without his presence. As an extension of his role as a divine judge, Utu could be associated with the underworld, though this connection is not attested before the Old Babylonian period. In exorcisms, he could be implored to help with bringing restless ghosts to the land of the dead. In this capacity he could be associated with the deified legendary king Gilgamesh, commonly portrayed in a similar role.

Shamash and Adad were jointly regarded as gods of divination, especially extispicy. The connection between the sun god and the weather god is well attested in Mesopotamian sources and goes back to the Old Babylonian period. Its origin is uncertain, but since in the earliest Sumerian sources Ishkur, who was analogous to Adad, was not associated with divination, it is possible that it was based on the association between Hadad and the solar deity in Ebla and possibly elsewhere in Syria and Upper Mesopotamia. According to a late ritual text, Shamash and Adad were responsible for teaching divination to the mythical king Enmeduranki. Subsequently, he taught it to the people of Sippar, Nippur and Babylon.

==Iconography==

Whether referred to as Utu or Shamash, the sun god had identical iconography. Due to distinct attributes, he is considered one of the few Mesopotamian deities who can be identified in art with certainty. Depictions of him are known from many sites, for example Eshnunna, Tell al-Rimah, Sippar, Ur and Susa. His best attested attributes are a large saw (&quot;šaššaru&quot;) and rays of light emanating from his shoulders. The reasons behind associating him with the former are poorly understood, and various interpretations have been proposed, for example that it was a representation of the first ray of sunshine of the day, that it was associated with judgment, perhaps as a weapon used to behead criminals, or that the sun god used it to break through the mountains during his daily journey. Christopher Woods points out that both in Sumerian and Akkadian, judgments had to be &quot;cut&quot; (&quot;kud&quot;/&quot;parāsum&quot;), and therefore considers the association with judgment to be most likely. The saw&#x27;s presence is often used to identify depictions of gods as Utu. He could also be depicted holding the rod-and-ring symbol, commonly associated with major deities. In some cases he is shown handing them to human rulers.

Utu was commonly depicted on cylinder seals as early as in the third millennium BCE. Multiple motifs recur on them, some not known from textual sources. On seals from the Sargonic period, he could be depicted climbing over two mountains, which has been interpreted as a representation of sunrise. He was also commonly depicted traveling in a boat. This motif is the single best attested type of cylinder seal image from the third millennium BCE, with over fifty examples presently known. Another recurring image is a depiction of Utu, sometimes accompanied by another god, partaking in a battle between deities. The attendant deity is sometimes interpreted as Bunene. In some cases Inanna is shown watching the battle or partaking in it on Utu&#x27;s side. It has been suggested that it is a symbolic representation of a conflict between day and night, or that the deities confronted by Utu and his allies are rebellious mountain gods. Wilfred G. Lambert suggested that in some cases figures from battle scenes with rays emanating from their shoulders might be representations of Enmesharra rather than the sun god, as in a tradition known from a late myth, Enmesharra&#x27;s Defeat, he was their original owner.

In the second millennium BCE, Utu was typically portrayed in front of worshipers, either standing or seated on a throne. One well known example of such an image is a stele of Hammurabi of Babylon, inscribed with his legal code.

Anna Kurmangaliev points out that only a single depiction of the sun god in anthropomorphic form has been identified among works of art from Babylonia from the first millennium BCE, the so-called Sun God Tablet. It is commonly discussed in scholarship, and has been described as &quot;one of the masterpieces of ancient Near Eastern art.&quot; It was discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in December 1880 during his excavations in Abu Habbah in modern Iraq. Its discovery subsequently made it possible to identify this site with Sippar. It dates to the Neo-Babylonian period, but its style has been described as &quot;archaizing,&quot; and most likely was inspired by motifs found in presentation scenes from the Ur III period. It shows three individuals, an intercessory minor goddess (&quot;lamma&quot;) and two men, possibly the king Nabu-apla-iddina and the priest Nabu-nadin-shumi, facing Shamash. While other anthropomorphic depictions of the sun god are known from Assyria from the same period, in Babylonia he came to be usually portrayed in the form of a symbol instead.

The symbolic representation of Utu was the sun disc, typically represented as a four-pointed star with wavy lines placed between the points. It is attested as early as in the Sargonic period, and continued to be represented in art through the rest of history of ancient Mesopotamia. It is well known from kudurru (boundary stones), where it is typically depicted in the first row of symbols, next to the eight-pointed star representing Inanna (Ishtar) and the crescent representing Nanna (Sin). Additionally the symbol of a winged sun came to be associated with the sun god in Assyria in the first millennium BCE. Some depictions of it add a bird tail as well. It only arrived in Babylonia during the reign of Nabonidus.

==Associations with other deities==
===Family===
The sun god was traditionally viewed as a son of the moon god in Mesopotamian religion, both in Sumerian and Akkadian texts. They are already attested as father and son in the Early Dynastic god list from Fara. The relation between them could be illustrated by matching epithets, for example in the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot; Utu is the &quot;small boat of heaven&quot; (Mabanda-anna), while his father Nanna - the &quot;great boat of heaven&quot; (Magula-anna). Ningal was regarded as Utu&#x27;s mother, and Inanna as his sister. &quot;Hymn to the Queen of Nippur&quot; refers to them as twins. Due to her identification with Ishtar (Inanna) the Hurrian and Elamite goddess Pinikir is referred to as a twin sister of Shamash and daughter of Sin (Nanna) and Ningal in a text written in Akkadian but found in a corpus of Hurro-Hittite rituals. In a single &quot;Maqlû&quot; incantation, the rainbow goddess Manzat is referred to as Shamash&#x27;s sister and as a daughter of Sin and Ningal.

The sun god&#x27;s wife was invariably the goddess of dawn and light, usually known under the name Aya, though the forms Ninkar, Sudaĝ, Sherida and Sudgan are also well attested. Typically they were worshiped together, though sometimes Shamash shared his temples with other gods instead. Utu/Shamash and Aya are the single most common divine couple in cylinder seal inscriptions from Sippar, with only the number of dedications to Ishkur and Shala being comparably high. Aya was believed to intercede with her husband on behalf of worshipers, which is a function also well attested for other divine spouses, such as Ninmug and Shala. It has also been pointed out that in the case of Inanna, her sukkal Ninshubur fulfilled a similar role. In legal texts from Sippar, the sun god and his wife commonly appear as divine witnesses. The only other divine couple attested in this role in this city are Mamu and Bunene. Buduhudug, a mythical mountain where the sun was believed to set, was regarded as &quot;the entrance of Shamash to Aya&quot; (&quot;nēreb dŠamaš &lt;ana&gt; dAya&quot;), the place where they were able to reunite each day after he finished his journey through the sky.

The deities counted among Utu&#x27;s children include the dream goddess Mamu (as well as two other, male, dream deities, Sisig and Zaqar), Šumugan, a god associated with animals, Niggina (Kittum), the deified concept of truth, according to Jacob Klein regarded as his principal daughter, and Ishum.

In myths both about himself and about Lugalbanda, the legendary king Enmerkar was referred to as a son of Utu. However, in the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; Utu is instead his grandfather, and his father is a human ruler, Meškiağašer. Unlike other legendary kings of Uruk, namely Lugalbanda and Gilgamesh, Enmerkar was not deified, despite the existence of a tradition attributing divine ancestry to him. In various sources, Utu seems to serve as a special protector to several of Uruk&#x27;s other kings.

dAMAR.UD, an early writing of Marduk&#x27;s name, can be translated as &quot;bull calf of Utu,&quot; as long as it is assumed that the sign UD should be understood as a writing of Utu&#x27;s name without the divine determinative (a cuneiform sign preceding names of deities), which is also attested in some theophoric names from the Early Dynastic period. However, no evidence exists that Marduk was ever viewed as a member of the family of any sun deity in Sippar, Larsa or any other location in Mesopotamia, which lead Wilfred G. Lambert to suggest this etymology is not plausible on theological grounds.

===Court===
Multiple deities who could be regarded as the sukkal (attendant deity) of Utu are known, and more than one could appear in this role at a time. Bunene, also known under the name Papnunna, was considered his chariot driver. Frans Wiggermann notes that his name and character (as well as these of other well attested sukkals of major city gods: Ninshubur, Alammush, Nuska and Isimud) do not appear to show direct connection with these of his master, which means that he cannot be considered the personification of the effect of the corresponding major deity&#x27;s actions (unlike such deities as Nabium, deified flame and sukkal of the fire god Girra or Nimgir, deified lightning and sukkal of the weather god Ishkur) or a divine personifications of specific commands (unlike such deities as Eturammi, &quot;do not slacken,&quot; the sukkal of Birtum). Ninpirig was referred to as Utu&#x27;s sukkalmah (&quot;great sukkal&quot;). It has been proposed that his name might hint at a connection with light. He is attested in multiple theophoric names, chiefly from Sippar. Some researchers, including Antoine Cavigneaux and Manfred Krebernik, consider the reading of the second element of his name to be uncertain due to variable orthography, and transcribe it as Nin-PIRIG. The pair Nigzida and Nigsisa, whose names mean &quot;law&quot; and &quot;order,&quot; respectively, are identified as the &quot;vizier of the left&quot; and &quot;vizier of the right&quot; in the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;. Nigsisa alone is mentioned by Ninsun as Shamash&#x27;s sukkal in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. Nigzida could be equated with Niggina, another goddess regarded as the sun god&#x27;s sukkal, though the latter deity&#x27;s role varies between that of a servant and oldest daughter in known copies of the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;. Her Akkadian counterpart was Kittum, whose name has the same meaning, &quot;truth.&quot; In &quot;An = Anum&quot; Kittum is instead male and a brother of Niggina. She had a sukkal of her own, Iqbi-damiq.

None of Utu&#x27;s sukkals known from other sources are present in documents from the archive of the First Sealand dynasty. Odette Boivin proposes that in local tradition, this role was instead fulfilled by the deities Lugal-namtarra and dSUKKAL, who frequently appear alongside the sun god, and that the former functioned as his sukkal during his nightly journey through the underworld, while the latter fulfilled the same role during the day. Lugal-namtarra is otherwise sparsely attested and might be analogous to Namtar. Boivin speculates that dSUKKAL developed from the male version of Ninshubur, and assumes it is plausible a connection between the latter and the sun god developed during the reign of Rim-Sîn I, a king of Larsa well known for his devotion to Ninshubur.

Many deities belonging to the court of Utu were regarded as divine judges. They could be grouped together, and collective labels such as &quot;Eleven Standing Gods of Ebabbar&quot; or &quot;Six Judges of Shamash&quot; are known from various sources. One well known example of such a deity is Ishmekarab, who could also be associated with Inshushinak and Lagamal.

Kusarikku (bull-men, or, as argued by Frans Wiggermann, bison-men) were frequently associated with Utu, and especially through the second millennium BCE were commonly depicted as members of his court, for example as standard bearers. Similarly, the human-headed bull (&quot;alima&quot;) could accompany the solar disc in art, and a reference to its head serving as an emblem of Utu is known. It is possible that the association between bison-like mythical beings and the sun god was based on their shared connection to eastern mountains. A further type of apotropaic creature associated with Utu was the girtablullu (&quot;scorpion man&quot;). In the Standard Babylonian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, a scorpion man and a scorpion woman guard the mountain of sunrise.

According to Christopher Woods, it is possible that in a single case the minor serpentine god Nirah is attested as a member of the court of Shamash. He proposes that it was a result of the well attested association between the sun god and Ishtaran, whose servant Nirah usually was.

===Foreign deities===
The name of the Eblaite sun deity was represented with the logogram dUTU. Manfred Krebernik assumes that it should be read as Shamash, that the deity was male, and that the goddess Ninkar also attested in texts from Ebla was his spouse. Alfonso Archi instead concludes that the deity was primarily female based on lexical evidence, but points out that the Eblaites were definitely aware of the male eastern sun god, and seemingly adopted him into their pantheon as a secondary hypostasis. Occasionally the sun deity&#x27;s gender had to be indicated directly, and both dUTU-&quot;munus&quot; (female) and dUTU-&quot;nita&quot; (male) are attested. Joan Goodnick Westenholz proposed that Ninkar in Eblaite texts should be interpreted as Ninkarrak rather than the phonetically similar but more obscure Mesopotamian Ninkar. Occasional shortening of Ninkarrak&#x27;s name to &quot;Ninkar&quot; is known from Mesopotamian sources as well. This theory is also accepted by Archi, who notes it makes the widespread worship of Ninkar easier to explain.

The Hurrian sun god, Shimige, is already represented by the logogram dUTU in an inscription of Atalshen, an early king of Urkesh. It is the oldest known reference to him. He is directly equated with Utu in the trilingual Sumero-Hurro-Ugaritic version of the Weidner god list from Ugarit. It has been argued that his character was influenced at least in part by his Mesopotamian counterpart. Gary Beckman goes as far as suggesting that at least in Hittite texts, he &quot;cannot (yet?) be distinguished sufficiently&quot; from the latter. Due to this association, Aya was regarded as his spouse in Hurrian tradition, as attested in sources from Hattusa and Ugarit. In the trilingual god list, Bunene (transcribed as &quot;dwu-u-un-ni-nu-wa-an&quot;) appears in association with Shimige. Shimige is additionally equated with Lugalbanda in it, most likely because the Hurrian pantheon was smaller than that enumerated in Mesopotamian lists, creating the need to have a single Hurrian deity correspond to multiple Mesopotamian ones. The same list also attests the equivalence between Utu, Shimige and the Ugaritic sun goddess Shapash (Šapšu). Apparently to avoid the implications that Shapash had a wife, the scribes interpreted the name of Aya, present in the Sumerian original, as an unconventional writing of Ea. Instead of the Hurrian spelling of Aya, the name Eyan corresponds to him in the Hurrian column and Ugaritic one lists the local craftsman god Kothar-wa-Khasis.

The logogram dUTU is well attested in Hittite texts. In addition to Utu himself and his Akkadian counterpart, the deities represented by it were the Sun goddess of Arinna (dUTU &quot;uruArinna&quot;), the Sun goddess of the Earth (&quot;taknaš&quot; dUTU), the male Sun god of Heaven (&quot;nepišaš&quot; dUTU, dUTU ANE, dUTU ŠAME), as well as Luwian Tiwat, Palaic Tiyaz and Hurrian Shimige. Gary Beckman notes that the Hittite conception of solar deities does not show any Indo-European influence, and instead was largely similar to that known from Mesopotamia. He points out even the fact that the Sun god of Heaven was believed to travel in a quadriga drawn by horses, similar to Greek Helios, is not necessarily an example of the former, as deities traveling in chariots are already depicted on Mesopotamian seals from the Sargonic period.

The logogram dUTU also designated the sun deity or deities in Emar in the late Bronze Age. According to Gary Beckman, the Mesopotamian, West Semitic, Hurrian and Hittite sun deities might all be potentially represented by it in texts from this city. Eduardo Torrecilla notes in a more recent publication that the logogram commonly designates Shamash in the middle Euphrates area, and syllabic writings of his name are uncommon there, though he also states that Shimige cannot be ruled out as a possible reading in some cases.

In texts from Susa, Haft Tepe and Malamir in Elam the name of the sun god was usually written logographically as dUTU and it is uncertain when it refers to the Mesopotamian deity, and when to local Nahhunte. It is possible that in legal texts, when dUTU occurs next to Elamite deities Inshushinak, Ruhurater or Simut, the latter option is correct. While the god list &quot;An=Anum&quot; does mention Nahhunte, he is not explicitly labeled as a counterpart of Utu, and only appears as a member of a group called the &quot;Divine Seven of Elam,&quot; associated with the goddess Narundi. A Mesopotamian commentary on a birth incantation erroneously identifies him as a moon god and Narundi as a sun deity, explaining their names as, respectively, Sin and Shamash.

==Worship==

The main cult centers of the sun god were Larsa and Sippar, specifically Sippar-Ahrurum (Abu Habbah). The latter city was regarded as older in Mesopotamian tradition, and in lists of temples tends to be mentioned before Larsa. In both cities, the main temple dedicated to Utu and his spouse Aya was known as Ebabbar. Less important temples dedicated to him, located in Girsu and Assur, bore the same name. It means &quot;shining white house &quot;in Sumerian.

The oldest attested votive objects dedicated to Utu (or Shamash) are a mace head from Ur offered by a king named Anbu or Anunbu, and a statuette from Sippar from the reign of Ikun-Shamash of Mari. Both predate the Sargonic period. Evidence for the worship of Shamash in the third millennium BCE is available from the entire Akkadian-speaking area, from Mari and western Mesopotamian cities like Sippar, through Agade, to the Diyala area.

Celebrations related to the sun god took place on the eighth, fifteenth, twentieth and possibly first day of each month.

===Sippar===
In the Early Dynastic period kings of Mari most likely visited the Ebabbar in Sippar to pay homage to its deity. In later periods, it was renovated by multiple rulers, including Naram-Sin of Akkad (who installed his daughter Šumšani as ēntum-priestess), Sabium of Babylon, Samsu-iluna of Babylon, who called himself &quot;beloved of Shamash and Aya,&quot; one of the Kassite rulers bearing the name Kurigalzu (Kurigalzu I or Kurigalzu II), Ashurbanipal, Shamash-shum-ukin, Nebuchadnezzar II and Nabonidus. Many other kings are known to have patronized or visited it at some point, including Manishtushu, Apil-Sin, Hammurabi, Abi-Eshuh, Ammi-Ditana, Ammi-Saduqa, Samsu-Ditana, Simbar-shipak and Nabu-apla-iddina. In addition to Ebabbar, a ziggurat dedicated to the city&#x27;s tutelary god also existed in Sippar. It was known as Ekunankuga (Siumerian: &quot;house, pure stairway to heaven&quot;). It was rebuilt by Samsu-iluna, Ammi-Saduqa, Neriglissar and Nabonidus. The position of Sippar and its tutelary god has been compared to that of Nippur and Enlil - while both of these gods were high-ranking members of the pantheon, and their cities were centers of religious and scholarly activity, they never constituted major political powers in their own right.

It has been suggested that the Ebabbar in Sippar served as a treasury housing particularly rare objects, as excavations of the Neo-Babylonian level of the structure revealed a number of vases from the Early Dynastic and Sargonic periods, some with signs of repair, as well as the votive statue of Ikun-Shamash, a fragment of a monolith of Manishtushu, a macehead of Shar-Kali-Sharri, a whetstone of Tukulti-Mer of Hana, and other objects from earlier periods of Mesopotamian history.

A special group connected to Shamash in Sippar were women referred to as &quot;nadītu&quot;. Their existence is particularly well attested in the Old Babylonian period, and it has been argued that the institution first developed around 1880 BCE, during the reign of Sumu-la-El of Babylon. &quot;Nadītu&quot; lived in a building referred to as &quot;gagûm&quot;, conventionally translated as &quot;cloister,&quot; and Tonia Sharlach notes they can be compared to medieval Christian nuns. They are sometimes described as &quot;priestesses&quot; in modern literature, but while it is well attested that they were considered to be dedicated to a specific deity, there is little evidence for their involvement in religious activities other than personal prayer. It is not impossible they were understood as a fully separate social class. Family background of individual &quot;nadītu&quot; varied, though they came predominantly from the higher strata of society. While many came from families of craftsmen, scribes or military officials, a number of them were daughters or sisters of kings. Both Zimri-Lim of Mari and Hammurabi of Babylon had &quot;nadītu&quot; of Shamash among their female family members.

A ceremony called &quot;lubuštu&quot; was established in Sippar by Nabu-apla-iddina. It involved providing the statues of Shamash, Aya and Bunene with new garments at specific dates throughout the year. Records indicate it was still celebrated in the Achaemenid period, during the reign of Darius I.

===Larsa===
The Ebabbar in Larsa is mentioned for the first time in a text from the reign Eannatum. It was rebuilt, expanded or repaired by Ur-Nammu of Ur, Zabaya, Sin-Iddinam, Hammurabi, one of the two rulers bearing the name Kadashman-Enlil (Kadashman-Enlil I or Kadashman-Enlil II), Burnaburiash I, Nebuchadnezzar II and Nabonidus. Other rulers who have patronized it at some point include Gungunum, Abisare, Sumuel, Nur-Adad, Sin-Iqisham, Kudur-Mabuk, Warad-Sin and Rim-Sîn I.

Odette Boivin notes that the deities of Larsa were apparently well represented in the pantheon of the First Sealand dynasty. She suggests that those kings might have associated their position both with Larsa and with its tutelary god.

The Larsean form of the sun god was also worshiped in Uruk and a close connection between these two cities is well documented. At an unknown point in time after Larsa&#x27;s loss of status, possibly in the Kassite period, Uruk most likely gained influence over it, and in the Neo-Babylonian period, the Ebabbar was functionally a subordinate temple of Eanna. Multiple letters attest that the latter was responsible for providing commodities required for the performance of various rites in the former, for example sacrificial animals or wool for garments of divine statues of Shamash and Belet Larsa (&quot;Lady of Larsa,&quot; most likely a title of Aya). Craftsmen employed by the Eanna were also responsible for repairing the paraphernalia of the deities of Ebabbar. Such a situation is otherwise unknown, as each temple usually maintained its own workshop. A treasury of Shamash and Aya, distinct from that of the Eanna, is nonetheless attested. Ebabbar most likely remained under control of the temple administration from Uruk in the Hellenistic period, though known names of the city&#x27;s inhabitants from this period are predominantly Greek, rather than Mesopotamian.

===Other cities===
Utu was among the deities worshiped in the territory of Lagash in the Early Dynastic period. A dais dedicated to him existed in Namnuda-kigarra. It was originally erected by Eannatum, then destroyed by Ur-Lumma of Umma, and finally rebuilt by Entemena. It is possible that these events took place during a border conflict between Umma and Lagash. Theophoric names invoking Utu are well attested in texts from this area. Examples include Shubur-Utu, Utu-amu and Utu-kiag.

A temple of Utu, Ehili (&quot;house of luxuriance&quot;) also existed in Ur. It was rebuilt by Enannatumma, the daughter of Ishme-Dagan, whose inscriptions refer to it as the god&#x27;s &quot;pure storeroom.&quot; A town located near this city, most likely somewhere between it and Larsa, bore the name Kar-Shamash, KAR.dUTUki. Most likely a temple dedicated to the eponymous god existed there as well.

In Babylon, Shamash was worshiped in the temple Edikukalamma (&quot;house of the judge of the land&quot;), first attested in the Old Babylonian period and still mentioned in inscriptions from the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II. He was also one of the many gods worshiped in the Esagil temple complex, where his seat was the E-ešbaranki (&quot;house of decisions of heaven and the underworld&quot;). A socle dedicated to him called Edikugal (&quot;house of the great judge&quot;) was also present in Erabriri, most likely the temple bearing this name located in Babylon which was dedicated to Mandanu.

In Assur, a temple of Shamash was refounded by king Arik-den-ili, though as no name is given in sources mentioning this event it is uncertain if it was identical with Ebabbar of Assur mentioned in a later topographical text. Additionally, Ehulhuldirdirra (&quot;house of surpassing joys&quot;), while primarily dedicated to Sin, was also associated with Shamash, as attested in building inscriptions of Ashur-nirari I, Tukulti-Ninurta I and Ashurnasirpal II.

A sanctuary in Nippur known in Akkadian as &quot;bīt dalīli&quot;, &quot;house of fame,&quot; was jointly dedicated to Nisaba, Kusu, Ningal, Shamash and Bēl-āliya.

In the Old Babylonian period, Shamash was worshiped in Susa in Elam, where the local pantheon consisted out of both Elamite deities, such as Inshushinak and Simut, and Mesopotamian ones. He appears in oath formulas and theophoric names.

In Mari, Shamash was worshiped in a temple named Egirzalanki (&quot;house of the joy of heaven and the underworld&quot;), built by Yahdun-Lim.

An inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II might indicate that the sun god&#x27;s manifestation from Larsa was also worshiped in Ekarra (&quot;house of the quay&quot;), a temple located in Dilmun, on the Failaka Island, which was dedicated to the local deities Inzak and Meskilak.

The &quot;Canonical Temple List&quot;, which dates to the Kassite period, mentions further temples, whose location is left unspecified: Eantasurra (&quot;house which twinkles from heaven;&quot; not to be confused with an identically named temple of Ningirsu built by Akurgal somewhere near Girsu), Ekukina (&quot;pure house, bechamber&quot;), Enamtarkalamma (&quot;house of the destinies of the land&quot;) and Enugalanna (reading and translation uncertain, possibly &quot;house of the great light of heaven&quot;).

In the Parthian period, Hatra came to be seen as a cult center of the sun god, and according to Manfred Krebernik its importance can be compared to Sippar and Larsa in earlier times.

==Mythology==
While no myths focused on Utu are presently known, he appears in a supporting role in many well known compositions. Commonly other figures appeal to him, especially when faced with problems connected with locations far away from urban centers, such as steppes or mountains.

In multiple accounts of Dumuzi&#x27;s death, he pleads with Utu to save him from the &quot;galla&quot; demons sent after him. This motif is attested in &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent&quot;, &quot;Dumuzi&#x27;s Death&quot;, and other works. In &quot;Dumuzi and Geshtinanna,&quot; Utu is specifically invoked as a judge. In all cases, the circumstances leading to it are the same: Dumuzi is already pursued, and his life is in danger. In both &quot;Dumuzi&#x27;s Death&quot; and &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent&quot;, he argues Utu should help him because he is his brother-in-law. Some copies of the latter narrative also include a couplet in which he also states that he paid respect to Utu&#x27;s and Inanna&#x27;s mother, Ningal. While Utu fulfills Dumuzi&#x27;s request in all known myths about his death, in none of them this is enough to save him, and the most the sun god can accomplish is a delay of his death.

In the myth &quot;How Grain Came to Sumer&quot;, Ninmada advises Ninazu to ask Utu for help with bringing barley from a distant land. Since the rest of the narrative is not preserved, it is unknown in which way he helped them accomplish this goal.

In the myth &quot;Inanna and An&quot;, Utu aids his sister with bringing the Eanna temple down from heaven. It is possible that it served as a mythical explanation of the origin of Mesopotamian temples.

A myth involving the sun god and other deities is known from Ebla. It might have been imported from Kish, and the language it was written in has been described as &quot;an archaic Akkadian dialect.&quot; Due to many uncertainties translation and interpretation of this text are considered difficult. It has been argued that it might be a description of a meeting between Enki and Utu during the latter&#x27;s journey through the Abzu.

Shamash is mentioned in a myth which deals with the origin of the god Ishum, which is only known from a single fragment from the Old Babylonian period. Ishum is described as a son of Ninlil and the sun god who was abandoned in the streets. It is assumed that this story represents a relic of the association between the goddess Sud, who came to be identified with Ninlil, and Sudaĝ, one of the names of the wife of Utu. Ishum was usually regarded as the son of this couple instead. Manfred Krebernik considers the composition to be the result of confusion between the names Sud and Sudaĝ, and thus between Ninlil and Ishum&#x27;s mother, rather than syncretism.

In the myth &quot;Enmesharra&#x27;s Defeat&quot;, which is only known from a single poorly preserved copy from either the Seleucid or Parthian period, Shamash&#x27;s radiance was bestowed upon him by Marduk after the imprisonment of the eponymous being, who was its original owner. The term used to describe it is &quot;zīmû&quot; (&quot;zi-mu-ú&quot;), which can refer to a halo and possibly to the rays of the sun. Wilfred G. Lambert assumed that this scene might be an echo of some of the depictions of fights between gods from Sargonic cylinder seals.

===Gilgamesh myths===

In the Sumerian myth &quot;Gilgamesh and Humbaba&quot;, Enkidu tells Gilgamesh that he should ask Utu for permission before they embark on the journey to Humbaba&#x27;s dwelling. After learning that Gilgamesh wants to acquire fame because he knows he will not live forever, Utu grants him seven constellations (described as zoomorphic creatures) meant to guide him to his destination safely. Humbaba later tries pleading with Utu when he is about to die, but his prayer is unsuccessful. It is possible that in a slightly divergent version of the myth he was spared, though this remains uncertain as its ending is not preserved.

In another early Gilgamesh narrative, &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld&quot;, Utu is first referenced by Inanna, who asks Gilgamesh to help her with getting rid of creatures infesting a tree she planted on the bank of the Euphrates. She states that Utu refused to intervene. The reasoning behind his decision is not explained. Later, when Enkidu is confined in the underworld, Gilgamesh petitions Enki for help. The latter tells Utu to bring Enkidu&#x27;s shade with him when he rises, which lets the heroes temporarily reunite. A retelling of this episode is also known from the final tablet of the &quot;Standard Babylonian&quot; &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, which has no direct connection to the rest of this version of the story. An old erroneous view was that the god acting on Ea&#x27;s (Enki&#x27;s) command in this version is Nergal rather than Shamash.

In the Old Babylonian version of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, Gilgamesh prays to Shamash after deciding to venture to the Cedar Forest to vanquish Humbaba. Later the elders of Uruk tell him to dig wells to be able to make libations to the sun god and Lugalbanda (in this version functioning as his personal god) while traveling westwards. On the way, shortly before reaching the land of Ebla, Gilgamesh has a dream which Enkidu interprets as a sign that Shamash (or, in a variant from Tell Harmal, Shamash and Lugalbanda) views his efforts favorably. It is possible that in one of the variants of the Old Babylonian version, only known from Tell Harmal, Humbaba says that he was informed by Shamash in a dream that he will be vanquished, though the state of preservation of the tablet makes it impossible to determine this with certainty. According to a tablet presumed to originate in Sippar, Gilgamesh later encounters Shamash while wandering in the steppe mourning Enkidu&#x27;s death. The sun god warns him about the futility of the quest for eternal life. This passage is not present in any later versions, but Shamash&#x27;s advice closely parallels another unique scene from the same version, namely the advice given by the anonymous alewife who corresponds to Šiduri from the Standard Babylonian version.

In the Standard Babylonian version of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; Shamash is portrayed as Gilgamesh&#x27;s divine patron. He is still invoked to protect him on the way to Humbaba&#x27;s forest, but the hero does not pray to him on his own. Instead his mother, the goddess Ninsun, invokes the sun god on the roof of her own temple. She blames Shamash for Gilgamesh&#x27;s desire to venture into distant lands, and asks his wife Aya to intercede on her son&#x27;s behalf to guarantee his safety. During the confrontation with Humbaba, Shamash intervenes by sending thirteen winds to incapacitate the monster, which lets Gilgamesh strike the decisive blow. Andrew R. George notes that since this version describes Humbaba as &quot;mimma lemnu&quot;, a term which can be translated as &quot;everything evil&quot; or &quot;an evil thing,&quot; often found in exorcistic literature where it refers to hostile forces, it is natural for Shamash, who was the god of justice, to oppose him. In an earlier interpretation, Jeffrey Tigay argued that Shamash outright becomes the instigator of the quest, which according to him was the &quot;final and logical development of his role.&quot; However, according to George Shamash&#x27;s participation in the slaying of Humbaba is the realization of the requests from Ninsun&#x27;s prayer. In the same version of the composition, after the defeat of the Bull of Heaven Gilgamesh and Enkidu offer the animal&#x27;s heart to Shamash, which might be a reference to a custom also mentioned in one of the myths about Lugalbanda, in which he offers the heart of a mundane wild bull to Utu after a successful hunt. After celebrations of their victory, Enkidu has a dream vision of an argument between gods during which Shamash protests Enlil&#x27;s decision that one of the heroes has to die as punishment for the slaying of Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven. After waking up he laments that they dedicated a door made from the cedar wood from Humbaba&#x27;s forest to Enlil rather than Shamash.

In the flood myth which became part of the standard version of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, Shamash is responsible for announcing the beginning of the flood when he rises in the morning, which according to Nathan Wasserman represents a relatively young tradition, as in most of the other versions the cataclysm starts in the middle of the night. He suggests that most likely the compiler of the text found this to be suitable given the sun god&#x27;s role as humanity&#x27;s helper through the story.

<text>Captain Marvel is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Most of these versions exist in Marvel&#x27;s main shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe. The original Captain Marvel is Mar-Vell and the current incarnation of the character is Carol Danvers.

In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Carol Danvers is Captain Marvel, portrayed by McKenna Grace and Brie Larson in &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; and &quot;&quot; (both 2019), &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (2021), Disney+ television series &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; (2022), and the movie &quot;The Marvels&quot; (2023).

== Publication history ==

Following a trial in which DC Comics sued Fawcett Comics for breach of copyright, claiming Fawcett&#x27;s Captain Marvel was too similar to Superman, the latter stopped publishing Captain Marvel in 1953. In the late 1960s Marvel gained the trademark &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; with its first series.

In order to retain its trademark, Marvel has published a &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; title periodically every few years since, leading to a number of ongoing series, limited series, and one-shots featuring a range of characters using the Captain Marvel alias.

=== Mar-Vell ===
The first Captain Marvel is Mar-Vell. Created by Stan Lee and artist Gene Colan, the character first appeared in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; #12 (December 1967).

Captain Mar-Vell is a military officer of the Kree Imperial Militia sent to observe the planet Earth, as it is developing technology to travel into space. Mar-Vell eventually wearies of his superiors&#x27; malicious intent and allies himself with Earth, and the Kree Empire brands him a traitor. From then on, Mar-Vell fights to protect Earth from all threats.

He was later revamped by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane. Having been exiled to the Negative Zone by the Supreme Intelligence, the only way Mar-Vell can temporarily escape is to exchange atoms with Rick Jones by means of special wristbands called Nega-Bands. He is also given superpowers, and his Kree military uniform is replaced with a form-fitting costume. The process of the young man being replaced in a flash by the older superhero was a nod to the original Fawcett Captain Marvel, which had young Billy Batson say the magic word &quot;Shazam&quot; to transform into the hero.

With the title&#x27;s sales still flagging, Marvel allowed Jim Starlin to conceptually revamp the character, although his appearance was little changed. Mar-Vell is freed from the Negative Zone and becomes a cosmic champion, the &quot;Protector of the Universe&quot; appointed by the cosmic entity Eon. Together, Mar-Vell and Rick continue to battle against evil, most notably battling the Death-worshipping Thanos. Mar-Vell became a close ally of the Titans, and one of their number, Elysius, became his lover.

His career was cut short when he developed inoperable cancer, the result of earlier exposure to nerve gas during a battle with Nitro. He died from cancer in the 1982 graphic novel &quot;The Death of Captain Marvel&quot; and has remained dead since.

=== Monica Rambeau ===

The second Captain Marvel is Monica Rambeau. Created by Roger Stern and John Romita Jr., the character first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot;#16 (October 1982).

Monica Rambeau is a police lieutenant from New Orleans, Louisiana who can transform into any form of energy. Her powers were briefly altered so that she cannot transform to energy, but instead can generate a personal force field. Sometime later, the Stranger returned her energy-transformation abilities. She is a member of the Avengers, and at one point she served as their leader. She eventually ceded the Captain Marvel name to the original Captain Marvel&#x27;s son after which Rambeau took the name Photon, using that name for quite some time until Genis-Vell adopted the same name. Genis-Vell and Monica discussed this, and Monica decided on the name Pulsar.

Rambeau later joined H.A.T.E. (the Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort) in the new series titled &quot;Nextwave&quot;. In this series created by Warren Ellis and Stuart Immonen, H.A.T.E. (a subsidiary of the Beyond Corporation) forms a team to fight the Bizarre Weapons of Mass Destruction. Members include Monica Rambeau, a man known only as The Captain, Boom Boom, Aaron Stack, and Elsa Bloodstone. She returned to the Avengers using the codename Spectrum.

=== Genis-Vell ===

The third Captain Marvel is Genis-Vell. Created by Ron Marz and Ron Lim, the character first appeared in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; vol. 3 Annual #6 (1993).

Genis-Vell is the genetically-engineered son of Mar-Vell and his lover Elysius, created from the late Mar-Vell&#x27;s cell samples and artificially aged to physical, if not emotional, maturity. Genis, like his father, wears the Nega-Bands, possesses Cosmic Awareness, and is, for a time, bonded with Rick Jones. Although the pair do not get along at first, they eventually become good friends. Genis goes insane and threatens to destroy the universe.

After dying and resurrecting himself with the secret aid of Helmut Zemo, Genis-Vell joins the Thunderbolts under the name Photon. However, in accelerating his resurrection, Zemo links Genis to the ends of time, causing a degenerative effect on the universe. To prevent the inevitable destruction of all existence, Zemo scatters pieces of Genis-Vell&#x27;s body through time and the Darkforce. Years later, he is resurrected by Carol Danvers and Phyla-Vell.

=== Phyla-Vell ===

The fourth Captain Marvel is Phyla-Vell. Created by Peter David and Paul Azaceta, the character first appeared in &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; vol. 5 #16 (November 2003).

Phyla-Vell is the sister of Genis-Vell. She is created when Genis, an only child, recreates the universe and, in doing so, creates various anomalies which result in his mother being restored to life and his sister coming into existence. She is last seen romancing Moondragon.

Phyla-Vell appears in the &quot;Annihilation&quot; event, fighting alongside Nova&#x27;s United Front in an effort to stop the destructive armies of Annihilus. She becomes the new Quasar after the original, Wendell Vaughn, is killed by Annihilus.

Phyla has superhuman strength. She can fire energy blasts, fly, and act like an &quot;energy sponge&quot;, absorbing any energy attacks directed at her and returning them as energy blasts. Phyla also has cosmic awareness and is a proficient fighter.

Phyla later becomes an avatar for Oblivion and renames herself Martyr. She is later killed rescuing the Guardians of the Galaxy, and has remained dead since.

=== Khn&#x27;nr ===
The fifth Captain Marvel is Khn&#x27;nr. Created by Paul Jenkins and Tom Raney, the character first appeared in &quot;Civil War: The Return&quot; (January 2007).

He is a Skrull sleeper agent who is bound with Mar-Vell&#x27;s DNA to lock itself into Mar-Vell&#x27;s form and given technological replicas of the Kree Nega-Bands. However, his mental conditioning was botched, causing Khn&#x27;nr&#x27;s personality to be erased, leaving the Mar-Vell persona dominant. Though part of the Secret Invasion, Khn&#x27;nr decides to fight against the invading Skrulls, during which he is nearly killed.

=== Noh-Varr ===

The sixth Captain Marvel is Noh-Varr. Created by Grant Morrison and J.G. Jones, the character first appeared in &quot;Marvel Boy&quot; #1 (August 2000).

As part of the Dark Reign storyline, Noh-Varr joined the new team the Dark Avengers, using the alias Captain Marvel. He subsequently quit the team upon discovering they were all villains, at which point he was contacted by the Supreme Intelligence, given a copy of the original Captain Marvel&#x27;s Nega Bands, and told he should take his place as the Kree&#x27;s protector of Earth. This led to Noh-Varr taking the new code name Protector. Noh-Varr currently goes by the codename Marvel Boy, the name he uses when he joins the Young Avengers and works alongside the Inhuman Royal Family.

=== Carol Danvers ===
The seventh Captain Marvel is Carol Danvers. Created by Roy Thomas and Gene Colan, the character first appeared in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; #13 (March 1968).

Carol Danvers, the longtime super-heroine known as Ms. Marvel, assumed the mantle of Captain Marvel in an ongoing series written by Kelly Sue DeConnick with art by Dexter Soy, in July 2012. Danvers dons a jumpsuit and explores her own past. DeConnick said at WonderCon 2012 that her pitch for the series could be described as &quot;Carol Danvers as Chuck Yeager.&quot; She said the series would contemplate what Captain Marvel&#x27;s legend means to Danvers, how she will wield it, and how the rest of the Marvel Universe reacts.

==Other versions==
===Age of Ultron===

In the Age of Ultron crossover event, Janet van Dyne becomes Captain Marvel in an alternate timeline created by the death of Hank Pym. Pym is murdered by a time-travelling Wolverine to prevent the creation of Ultron, who will kill most of Earth&#x27;s population in the future.

===Amalgam Comics===

In two issues of &quot;JLX&quot; and &quot;JLX: Unleashed&quot;, Captain Marvel combines with Captain Marvel to become yet another Captain Marvel, sporting the DC Comics lightning bolt uniform design but with the original green and white colors of the Marvel version.

===Cancerverse===
In &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot;, the main villain is an alternate version of Captain Marvel called Lord Mar-Vell. Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, this Mar-Vell colluded with the Many-angled ones to survive his cancer by destroying Death.

===&quot;Fantastic Four: The End&quot;===
In the limited series &quot;Fantastic Four: The End&quot;, the superheroine formerly known as Kismet (now under the name of Ayesha) has apparently taken over the Captain Marvel mantle in the not-too-distant future.

===House of M===

In the alternate, mutant-dominated world created by Scarlet Witch, Carol Danvers (Ms. Marvel in mainstream continuity) uses the name Captain Marvel and is one of the few non-mutant heroes with a successful career.

===Marvel 2099===
In the unified Marvel 2099 reality of Earth-2099, Rowena Stern is the Captain Marvel of this time period. Sometime after her dads were killed by Radioactive Man of the 2099 version of the Masters of Evil, Captain Marvel joined the 2099 version of the New Avengers. Rowena was bothered by Radioactive Man mocking her dads&#x27; deaths until Radioactive Man was defeated by Hulk 2099.

===Marvel Zombies===

In the mini-series &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;, Captain Marvel is seen sitting with Vulture and Hercules (both infected) waiting for Iron Man. He is later killed by the Silver Surfer for immediate cause.

===&quot;Ruins&quot;===

In the two-issue Warren Ellis mini-series &quot;Ruins&quot; (1995), Captain Marvel is one of the many Kree prisoners, in a Kree reservation in Nevada. The reservation was placed deliberately on top of a former nuclear test site. As a result of this, the majority of the Kree are suffering from various forms of cancer, including Mar-Vell who is the Kree&#x27;s spokesperson. Mar-Vell gives an interview to Daily Bugle reporter Phil Sheldon regarding the failed Kree invasion of Earth. Mar-Vell recounts how his ship was made vulnerable to a nuclear strike when their cloaking and shielding was affected by cosmic radiation from a deceased Silver Surfer.

===Ultimate Marvel===

The Ultimate Marvel miniseries &quot;Ultimate Secret&quot; introduces Mahr Vehl, a renegade Kree who has been surgically altered to look human and sent to Earth by his people to observe its destruction by the entity Gah Lak Tus, but defects to help the humans. He wears a specially designed combat suit that is activated by his wristwatch. The Kree technology in the suit gives Mahr Vehl increased strength and allows him to fly, create energy shields, turn invisible, view different fields of the light spectrum, and fire energy blasts through the &quot;totalkannon&quot; located on his lower arm.

<text>Bucket sort, or bin sort, is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. It is a distribution sort, a generalization of pigeonhole sort that allows multiple keys per bucket, and is a cousin of radix sort in the most-to-least significant digit flavor. Bucket sort can be implemented with comparisons and therefore can also be considered a comparison sort algorithm. The computational complexity depends on the algorithm used to sort each bucket, the number of buckets to use, and whether the input is uniformly distributed.

Bucket sort works as follows:
# Set up an array of initially empty &quot;buckets&quot;.
# Scatter: Go over the original array, putting each object in its bucket.
# Sort each non-empty bucket.
# Gather: Visit the buckets in order and put all elements back into the original array.

==Pseudocode==

 function bucketSort(array, k) is
 buckets ← new array of k empty lists
 M ← 1 + the maximum key value in the array
 for i = 0 to length(array) do
 insert &quot;array[i]&quot; into &quot;buckets[floor(k × array[i] / M)]&quot;
 for i = 0 to k do 
 nextSort(buckets[i])
 return the concatenation of buckets[0], ..., buckets[k]

Let &quot;array&quot; denote the array to be sorted and &quot;k&quot; denote the number of buckets to use. One can compute the maximum key value in linear time by iterating over all the keys once. The floor function must be used to convert a floating number to an integer ( and possibly casting of datatypes too ). The function &quot;nextSort&quot; is a sorting function used to sort each bucket. Conventionally, insertion sort is used, but other algorithms could be used as well, such as &quot;selection sort&quot; or &quot;merge sort&quot;. Using &quot;bucketSort&quot; itself as &quot;nextSort&quot; produces a relative of radix sort; in particular, the case &quot;n = 2&quot; corresponds to quicksort (although potentially with poor pivot choices).

== Analysis ==

=== Worst-case analysis ===
When the input contains several keys that are close to each other (clustering), those elements are likely to be placed in the same bucket, which results in some buckets containing more elements than average. The worst-case scenario occurs when all the elements are placed in a single bucket. The overall performance would then be dominated by the algorithm used to sort each bucket, for example formula_1 insertion sort or formula_2 comparison sort algorithms, such as merge sort.

=== Average-case analysis ===
Consider the case that the input is uniformly distributed. The first step, which is initialize the buckets and find the maximum key value in the array, can be done in formula_3 time. If division and multiplication can be done in constant time, then scattering each element to its bucket also costs formula_3. Assume insertion sort is used to sort each bucket, then the third step costs formula_5, where formula_6 is the length of the bucket indexed formula_7. Since we are concerning the average time, the expectation formula_8 has to be evaluated instead. Let formula_9 be the random variable that is formula_10 if element formula_11 is placed in bucket formula_7, and formula_13 otherwise. We have formula_14. Therefore,

:formula_15

The last line separates the summation into the case formula_16 and the case formula_17. Since the chance of an object distributed to bucket formula_7 is formula_19, formula_20 is 1 with probability formula_19 and 0 otherwise.

:formula_22
:formula_23

With the summation, it would be

:formula_24

Finally, the complexity would be formula_25.

The last step of bucket sort, which is concatenating all the sorted objects in each bucket, requires formula_26 time. Therefore, the total complexity is formula_27. Note that if k is chosen to be formula_28, then bucket sort runs in formula_3 average time, given a uniformly distributed input.

==Optimizations==

A common optimization is to put the unsorted elements of the buckets back in the original array &quot;first&quot;, then run insertion sort over the complete array; because insertion sort&#x27;s runtime is based on how far each element is from its final position, the number of comparisons remains relatively small, and the memory hierarchy is better exploited by storing the list contiguously in memory.

If the input distribution is known or can be estimated, buckets can often be chosen which contain constant density (rather than merely having constant size). This allows formula_3 average time complexity even without uniformly distributed input.

== Variants ==

===Generic bucket sort===
The most common variant of bucket sort operates on a list of &quot;n&quot; numeric inputs between zero and some maximum value &quot;M&quot; and divides the value range into &quot;b&quot; buckets each of size &quot;M&quot;/&quot;b&quot;. If each bucket is sorted using insertion sort, the sort can be shown to run in expected linear time (where the average is taken over all possible inputs). However, the performance of this sort degrades with clustering; if many values occur close together, they will all fall into a single bucket and be sorted slowly. This performance degradation is avoided in the original bucket sort algorithm by assuming that the input is generated by a random process that distributes elements uniformly over the interval &quot;[0,1)&quot;.

===ProxmapSort===

Similar to generic bucket sort as described above, ProxmapSort works by dividing an array of keys into subarrays via the use of a &quot;map key&quot; function that preserves a partial ordering on the keys; as each key is added to its subarray, insertion sort is used to keep that subarray sorted, resulting in the entire array being in sorted order when ProxmapSort completes. ProxmapSort differs from bucket sorts in its use of the map key to place the data approximately where it belongs in sorted order, producing a &quot;proxmap&quot; — a proximity mapping — of the keys.

===Histogram sort===
Another variant of bucket sort known as histogram sort or counting sort adds an initial pass that counts the number of elements that will fall into each bucket using a count array. Using this information, the array values can be arranged into a sequence of buckets in-place by a sequence of exchanges, leaving no space overhead for bucket storage.

===Postman&#x27;s sort===
The Postman&#x27;s sort is a variant of bucket sort that takes advantage of a hierarchical structure of elements, typically described by a set of attributes. This is the algorithm used by letter-sorting machines in post offices: mail is sorted first between domestic and international; then by state, province or territory; then by destination post office; then by routes, etc. Since keys are not compared against each other, sorting time is O(&quot;cn&quot;), where &quot;c&quot; depends on the size of the key and number of buckets. This is similar to a radix sort that works &quot;top down,&quot; or &quot;most significant digit first.&quot;

===Shuffle sort===
The shuffle sort is a variant of bucket sort that begins by removing the first 1/8 of the &quot;n&quot; items to be sorted, sorts them recursively, and puts them in an array. This creates &quot;n&quot;/8 &quot;buckets&quot; to which the remaining 7/8 of the items are distributed. Each &quot;bucket&quot; is then sorted, and the &quot;buckets&quot; are concatenated into a sorted array.

==Comparison with other sorting algorithms==

Bucket sort can be seen as a generalization of counting sort; in fact, if each bucket has size 1 then bucket sort degenerates to counting sort. The variable bucket size of bucket sort allows it to use O(&quot;n&quot;) memory instead of O(&quot;M&quot;) memory, where &quot;M&quot; is the number of distinct values; in exchange, it gives up counting sort&#x27;s O(&quot;n&quot; + &quot;M&quot;) worst-case behavior.

Bucket sort with two buckets is effectively a version of quicksort where the pivot value is always selected to be the middle value of the value range. While this choice is effective for uniformly distributed inputs, other means of choosing the pivot in quicksort such as randomly selected pivots make it more resistant to clustering in the input distribution.

The &quot;n&quot;-way mergesort algorithm also begins by distributing the list into &quot;n&quot; sublists and sorting each one; however, the sublists created by mergesort have overlapping value ranges and so cannot be recombined by simple concatenation as in bucket sort. Instead, they must be interleaved by a merge algorithm. However, this added expense is counterbalanced by the simpler scatter phase and the ability to ensure that each sublist is the same size, providing a good worst-case time bound.

Top-down radix sort can be seen as a special case of bucket sort where both the range of values and the number of buckets is constrained to be a power of two. Consequently, each bucket&#x27;s size is also a power of two, and the procedure can be applied recursively. This approach can accelerate the scatter phase, since we only need to examine a prefix of the bit representation of each element to determine its bucket.

<text>Sidney Joseph Bechet ( ; May 14, 1897 – May 14, 1959) was an American jazz saxophonist, clarinetist, and composer. He was one of the first important soloists in jazz, and first recorded several months before trumpeter Louis Armstrong. His erratic temperament hampered his career, and not until the late 1940s did he earn wide acclaim. Bechet spent much of his later life in France.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Bechet was born in New Orleans in 1897 to a middle-class Creole of color family. Bechet&#x27;s father Omar was both a shoemaker and a flute player, and all four of his brothers were musicians as well.

His older brother, Leonard Victor Bechet, was a full-time dentist and a part-time trombonist and bandleader. Bechet learned and mastered several musical instruments that were kept around the house (he began on the cornet), mostly by teaching himself; he decided to specialize in the clarinet (which he played almost exclusively until about 1919).

At the age of six, he started performing with his brother&#x27;s band at a family birthday party, debuting his talents to acclaim. Later in his youth, Bechet studied with Joseph &quot;King&quot; Oliver, Bunk Johnson, Freddie Keppard, Lorenzo Tio, &quot;Big Eye&quot; Louis Nelson Delisle, and George Baquet.

=== Musical development ===
Bechet played in many New Orleans ensembles using the improvisational techniques of the time (obbligatos with scales and arpeggios and varying the melody). 
While working with Louis Armstrong, Bechet was one of the first musicians to develop the Swing style of jazz; he influenced the widening difference between jazz and ragtime. Bechet liked to have his sound dominate in a performance, and trumpeters reportedly found it difficult to play alongside him.

He performed in parades with Freddie Keppard&#x27;s brass band, the Olympia Orchestra, and in John Robichaux&#x27;s dance orchestra. From 1911 to 1912, he performed with Bunk Johnson in the Eagle Band of New Orleans and in 1913–14 with King Oliver in the Olympia Band. From 1914 to 1917, he was touring and traveling, going as far north as Chicago and frequently performing with Freddie Keppard.

In the spring of 1919, he traveled to New York City and joined Will Marion Cook&#x27;s Syncopated Orchestra. Soon after, the orchestra traveled to Europe, where they performed at the Royal Philharmonic Hall in London. The group was warmly received, and Bechet was especially popular.

While in London, he discovered the straight soprano saxophone and developed a style unlike his clarinet tone. Bechet was the first influential soprano saxophonist, leading to its rising popularity as a jazz instrument.

His saxophone sound could be described as emotional, reckless, and all-encompassing. He often used a broad vibrato, similar to some New Orleans clarinetists at the time. In 1919, a Swiss classical music conductor, Ernest Ansermet, wrote a tribute to Bechet. It was one of the earliest (if not the first) articles about a jazz musician written by an expert in the field of classical music, linking Bechet&#x27;s music with that of Bach.

Bechet&#x27;s first recordings were made in 1923 and 1924. The session was led by Clarence Williams, a pianist and songwriter, better known at that time for his music publishing and record producing, and his &quot;Blue Five&quot; (which included Louis Armstrong). Bechet recorded &quot;Wild Cat Blues&quot; and &quot;Kansas City Man Blues.&quot; The former is in a ragtime style with four 16-bar themes, and the latter is a 12-bar blues. In 1924, Bechet worked with Duke Ellington for three months and made a significant impact on Ellington&#x27;s early jazz style. 
Duke Ellington called him &quot;the epitome of jazz.&quot; However, he never learned how to read music in his lifetime of being a musician.
=== Bechet in France ===
On September 15, 1925, Bechet and other members of the &quot;Revue Nègre&quot;, including Josephine Baker, sailed to Europe, arriving at Cherbourg, France, on September 22. The revue opened at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris on October 2. The show was an example of negrophilia in France at the time. He toured Europe with multiple bands, reaching as far as Russia in mid-1926. In 1928, he led his small band at Chez Bricktop (run by the popular Ada &quot;Bricktop&quot; Smith) in Montmartre, Paris.

In France, Bechet found that he was appreciated by a wider audience and had more general freedom than he did in the United States.

He was imprisoned in Paris for eleven months. In his autobiography, he wrote that he accidentally shot a woman when he was trying to shoot a musician who had insulted him. He had challenged the man to duel and said, &quot;Sidney Bechet never plays the wrong chord.&quot; After his release, he was deported to New York, arriving soon after the stock market crash of 1929. He joined with Lorenzo Tio and also came to know trumpeter Roy Eldridge.

In 1932, Bechet returned to New York City to lead a band with Tommy Ladnier. The band, comprising six members, performed at the Savoy Ballroom. He played in Noble Sissle&#x27;s orchestra, which toured in Germany and Russia.

=== Later life ===
In 1938, &quot;Hold Tight, Hold Tight (Want Some Seafood Mama),&quot; commonly known as &quot;Hold Tight,&quot; was composed by Bechet&#x27;s guitarist Leonard Ware and two session singers with claimed contributions from Bechet himself. The song became known for its suggestive lyrics and then for a series of lawsuits over songwriter royalties.

In 1939, Bechet and the pianist Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith led a group that recorded several early versions of what was later called Latin jazz, adapting traditional méringue, rhumba and Haitian songs to the jazz idiom. On July 28, 1940, Bechet made a guest appearance on the NBC Radio show &quot;The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street&quot;, playing two of his showpieces (&quot;Shake It and Break It&quot; and &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;) with Henry Levine&#x27;s Dixieland band. Levine invited Bechet into the RCA Victor recording studio (on 24th Street in New York City), where Bechet lent his soprano sax to Levine&#x27;s traditional arrangement of &quot;Muskrat Ramble.&quot; On April 18, 1941, as an early experiment in overdubbing at Victor, Bechet recorded a version of the pop song &quot;The Sheik of Araby,&quot; playing six different instruments: clarinet, soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, piano, bass, and drums. A hitherto unissued master of this recording was included in the 1965 LP &quot;Bechet of New Orleans&quot;, issued by RCA Victor as LPV-510. In the liner notes, George Hoeffer quoted Bechet:

&quot;I started by playing The Sheik on piano and played the drums while listening to the piano. I meant to play all the rhythm instruments but got all mixed up and grabbed my soprano, then the bass, then the tenor saxophone, and finally finished up with the clarinet.&quot;In 1944, 1946, and 1953, he recorded and performed in concert with the Chicago jazz pianist and vibraphonist Max Miller; private recordings from Miller&#x27;s archive have never been released. These concerts and recordings are described in John Chilton&#x27;s biography &quot;Sidney Bechet: The Wizard of Jazz&quot;.

With jobs in music difficult to find, he opened a tailor shop with Ladnier. They were visited by musicians and played in the back of the shop. In the 1940s, Bechet played in several bands, but his financial situation did not improve until the end of that decade. By the end of the 1940s, Bechet had tired of struggling to make music in the United States. His contract with Jazz Limited, a Chicago-based record label, was limiting the events at which he could perform (for instance, the label would not permit him to perform at the 1948 Festival of Europe in Nice). He believed the jazz scene in the United States had little left to offer him and was getting stale.

In 1958, Bechet performed as a soloist and with various other renowned musicians including Buck Clayton and Sarah Vaughn in memorable, spirited concerts in the United States Pavilion at Expo 58, the World&#x27;s Fair in Brussels, Belgium.

=== Permanent settlement in Paris ===
In 1951, he migrated to France permanently, after his performance as a soloist at the Paris Jazz Fair caused a surge in his popularity in that country, where he easily found well-paid work. Also, in 1951, he married Elisabeth Ziegler in Antibes.

In 1953, he signed a recording contract with Disques Vogue that lasted for the rest of his life. He recorded many hit tunes, including &quot;Les Oignons,&quot; &quot;Promenade aux Champs-Élysées,&quot; and the international hit &quot;Petite Fleur.&quot; He also composed a classical ballet score in the late Romantic style of Tchaikovsky called &quot;La nuit est une sorcière&quot; (&quot;The Night Is a Witch&quot;). Some existentialists in France took to calling him &quot;le dieu&quot; (&quot;the god&quot;).

=== Autobiography and death ===
Shortly before his death, Bechet dictated his autobiography, &quot;Treat It Gentle&quot;, to Al Rose, a record producer and radio host. He had worked with Rose several times in concert promotions and had a fractious relationship with him. In his autobiography, Bechet&#x27;s view of himself was starkly different from the one Rose knew.

&quot;The kindly old gentleman in his book was filled with charity and compassion. The one I knew was self-centered, cold, and capable of the most atrocious cruelty, especially toward women.&quot;

Though other internet sources have picked up the claim that Bechet dictated his autobiography to Al Rose, the autobiography itself—&quot;Treat It Gentle&quot; (Twayne, 1960)—notes that &quot;Among those who helped record and edit the tapes on which this book is based are Joan Reid, Desmond Flower, and John Ciardi.&quot; The &quot;Foreword&quot; to the book by Desmond Flower explains in detail how the material from the various interviews was put together into book form, and there is no mention of any involvement by Al Rose in the interviewing or editing process.

Although embellished and frequently inaccurate, &quot;Treat It Gentle&quot; remains a staple account for the &quot;insider&#x27;s view of the New Orleans tradition.&quot;

Bechet died in Garches, near Paris, of lung cancer on May 14, 1959, on his 62nd birthday. He is buried in a local cemetery. Two other major jazz musicians died that year: Billie Holiday and Lester Young.

=== Legacy ===
In 2013, a crater on Mercury was named after Bechet.

In the novel &quot;Steppenwolf&quot; by Hermann Hesse, Bechet was the inspiration for the character &quot;Pablo.&quot;

Bechet&#x27;s music has been included in the soundtracks of about 60 films, including the following: &quot;Flirting&quot; (1991), &quot;JFK&quot; (1991), &quot;Chocolat&quot; (2000), &quot;The Quiet American&quot; (2002), and &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; (2011).

Philip Larkin wrote a poem called &quot;For Sidney Bechet.&quot; It can be found in &quot;The Complete Poems&quot;. It is written about on the Philip Larkin Society website.

Van Morrison mentions Sidney Bechet in the song &quot;See Me Through Part II (Just A Closer Walk With Thee)&quot; from the 1990 album &quot;Hymns to the Silence&quot;: &quot;...Sidney Bechet on Sunday afternoons in winter/Sidney Bechet, Sunday afternoons in winter...&quot;

In Antibes, France, a small one-block park is named Sidney Bechet Square in his honor. The park contains a monument with a bust of Bechet and a plaque that reads, &quot;To Sidney BECHET, one of the world&#x27;s greatest jazz musicians, so honored by his new home. - Sidney J. BARTHELEMY, Mayor of New Orleans, April 16, 1994.&quot;

A fictionalized Sidney Bechet appears in two episodes of George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; portrayed by Jeffrey Wright.

Additionally, in an interview with Woody Allen, when asked what &quot;dead person he would like to have dinner with,&quot; he responded, &quot; ... I guess maybe Sidney Bechet.&quot; Bechet continues to live on in the movies of Allen.

== Personal life ==
Bechet was Catholic.

Bechet was known for having an abrasive attitude, which has been compared to that of Coleman Hawkins. They were both incredibly sure of their relative importance in the music industry during a time in which jazz was losing popularity. They were stubborn and lacked patience with younger artists with less experience or knowledge of the jazz industry.

Bechet briefly took time off from the music industry in 1938 when he opened a tailor shop in New York.

Bechet had three wives: Elizabeth Ziegler (1951–death), Marie-Louise Crawford (1934–1942), and Norma Hale (1918–1929).

<doc id="97597" wikidata="Q168925" url="?curid=97597" title="Flag of San Marino">
<text>The national flag of San Marino is formed by two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and light blue with the national coat of arms superimposed in the center; the coat of arms has a shield (featuring three towers on three peaks) with a closed crown on top, flanked by an oak and laurel wreath, with a scroll below bearing the word LIBERTAS (Freedom). The two colors of the flag represent peace (white) and liberty (light blue). 

Although the &quot;Law on the flag and coat of arms of San Marino&quot; from 22 July 2011 refers only to the &quot;official flag&quot; of the republic, a &quot;de facto&quot; civil flag, which omits the coat of arms, can sometimes be seen flying. Some official sources of San Marino suggest that the civil flag is actually the bicolor with the coat of arms of the specific city it is used in, instead of the national one.

The national ensign of San Marino is identical to the state flag.

San Marino&#x27;s municipalities all have flags that are very similar to San Marino&#x27;s national flag. These flags all contain a shield-like emblem on the horizontal white and blue bicolor. Closest to the hoist of these flags is the name of the municipality written vertically.

==History==

The oldest attested standard of the republic dates back from 4 September 1465, when it was commissioned from a manufacturer in Florence, allegedly composed of a tricolour of gold, white and &quot;alessandrino&quot; (thought to be purple, recently re-interpreted as a shade of azure).

In 1797, most likely influenced by the wave of reforms in France, the Supreme Council of the Republic commissioned a white and blue cockade, which, coincidentally or not, was identical to the one used by the French revolutionaries.

The decree of 6 April 1862 standardized the coat of arms, but did not mention the flag.

==Proportions and colors==
The official proportion of the flag is 3:4, the coat of arms&#x27; width being of the flag&#x27;s length. While the arms are horizontally centered, their vertical position on the flag is defined by the location of the center of the cross on top of the crown: at of the flag&#x27;s length. The proportion of the coat of arms is 5:6.

A 2:3 proportion can be used internationally and/or when specifically requested. In this case, the coat of arms&#x27; width is of the flag&#x27;s length, and the center of the cross on the top of the crown will be at of the flag&#x27;s height below the upper edge.

The colors of the flag are officially prescribed as follows: 

==Political flags==
==Municipalities (&quot;Castles&quot;)==
Castles have their own flag, as indicated by March 28th 1997 decree n°40. Article 2 demands each name to be indicated vertically at the hoist in peigmot font, but it is not enforced and it is usual see hoisted unnamed flags at public offices.
