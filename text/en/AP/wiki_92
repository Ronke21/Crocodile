<text>Shandong is a coastal province in East China. Shandong has played a major role in Chinese history since the beginning of Chinese civilization along the lower reaches of the Yellow River. It has served as a pivotal cultural and religious center for Taoism, Chinese Buddhism and Confucianism. Shandong&#x27;s Mount Tai is the most revered mountain of Taoism and a site with one of the longest histories of continuous religious worship in the world. The Buddhist temples in the mountains south of the provincial capital of Jinan were once among the foremost Buddhist sites in China. The city of Qufu was the birthplace of Confucius, and later became the center of Confucianism.

Shandong&#x27;s location at the intersection of ancient and modern north–south and east–west trading routes has helped establish it as an economic center. After a period of political instability and economic hardship beginning in the late 19th century, Shandong has experienced rapid growth in recent decades. Home to over 100 million inhabitants, Shandong is the world&#x27;s sixth-most populous subnational entity, and China&#x27;s second-most populous province. The economy of Shandong is China&#x27;s third-largest provincial economy with a GDP of (US$1.3 trillion) in 2021, equivalent to the GDP of Mexico. If considered among sovereign states, Shandong would rank as the 15th-largest economy and the 15th-most populous . Its GDP per capita is around the national average.

Shandong is one of China&#x27;s leading provinces in education and research. It has 153 higher education institutions, ranking second in East China after Jiangsu and fourth among all Chinese first-level divisions after Jiangsu, Guangdong and Henan. , the Nature Index ranked two major cities in Shandong (Jinan #31 and Qingdao #38) in the global top 40 cities by scientific research output.

== Etymology ==
Shandong&#x27;s name literally means &#x27;east of the mountains&#x27;, from and . The name refers to the province&#x27;s location to the east of the Taihang Mountains. A common nickname for Shandong is Qilu (), from the states of Qi and Lu that existed in the area during the Spring and Autumn period. Whereas Qi was a major political power, Lu played only a minor political role but became renowned as the home of Confucius, and its cultural influence came to eclipse that of Qi. The cultural legacy of Lu is reflected in the province&#x27;s official abbreviation of .

== History ==

===Ancient history===

With its location on the eastern edge of the North China Plain, Shandong was home to a succession of Neolithic cultures for millennia, including the Houli (), Beixin (), Dawenkou (), Longshan (), and Yueshi cultures ().

The Shang and Zhou dynasties exerted varying degrees of control over western Shandong, while eastern Shandong was inhabited by Dongyi peoples, who were considered barbarians by the inhabitants of the Central Plain. Following the by the state of Qi in 567 BC, the Dongyi gradually became sinicized.

During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, power was accumulated by regional states; Shandong was home to the state of Qi based in Linzi, and the state of Lu based in Qufu. Lu is famous for being the home of Confucius; however, it was comparatively small, eventually being annexed by the neighboring state of Chu to its south. Meanwhile, Qi was a significant power throughout the entire period, and ruled cities including Linzi, Jimo (near modern Qingdao) and Ju.

===Imperial history===
The Qin dynasty conquered Qi and founded the first centralized Chinese state in 221 BC. The Han dynasty that followed created several commanderies supervised by two regions () in what is now modern Shandong: Qingzhou () in the north and Yanzhou () in the south. During the Three Kingdoms period, Shandong was part of the northern kingdom of Cao Wei, which ruled over northern China.

After the Three Kingdoms period, a brief period of unity under the Western Jin dynasty gave way to invasions by nomadic peoples from the north. Northern China, including Shandong, was overrun. Over the next century or so, Shandong changed hands several times, falling to the Later Zhao, then Former Yan, then Former Qin, then Later Yan, then Southern Yan, then the Liu Song dynasty, and finally the Northern Wei dynasty, the first of the Northern dynasties during the Northern and Southern dynasties period. Shandong stayed with the Northern dynasties for the rest of this period.

In 412 AD, the Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian landed at Laoshan, on the southern edge of the Shandong peninsula, and proceeded to Qingzhou to edit and translate the scriptures he had brought back from India.

The Sui dynasty reestablished unity in 589, and the Tang dynasty (618–907) presided over the next golden age of China. For the earlier part of this period, Shandong was ruled as part of Henan Circuit, one of the circuits (a political division). Later on, China splintered into warlord factions, resulting in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Shandong was part of the Five Dynasties, all based in the north.

The Song dynasty reunified China in the late tenth century. The classic novel &quot;Water Margin&quot; was based on folk tales of outlaw bands active in Shandong during the Song dynasty. In 1996, the discovery of over two hundred buried Buddhist statues at Qingzhou was hailed as a major archaeological find. The statues included early examples of painted figures and are thought to have been buried due to Emperor Huizong&#x27;s repression of Buddhism (he favored Taoism).

The Song dynasty was forced to cede northern China to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1142. Shandong was administered by Jin as Shandong East Circuit and Shandong West Circuit – the first use of its current name.

===Early modern history===
The modern province of Shandong was created by the Ming dynasty, where it had a more expansive territory, including the agricultural part of Liaoning. After the Ming–Qing Transition in 1644, Shandong acquired (more or less) its current borders.

On 25 July 1668, an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 8.5 and an epicenter just northeast of Linyi devastated Shandong, and killed between 43,000 and 50,000 people.

During the 19th century, China became increasingly exposed to Western influence; Shandong, a coastal province under the dukedom of Xiong, was significantly affected. Qingdao was leased to Germany in 1897 and Weihai to Britain in 1898. As a result of foreign pressure from the Russian Empire, which had annexed Outer Manchuria by 1860, the Qing encouraged settlement of Shandong people to what remained of Manchuria.

Shandong was one of the first places where the Boxer Rebellion broke out, and became one of the centers of the uprising. In 1899, Qing general Yuan Shikai was appointed governor of the province to suppress the uprising. He held the post for three years.

Germany took control of the peninsula in 1898, leasing Jiaozhou Bay and its port of Qingdao under threat of force. Development was a high priority for the Germans: over 200 million marks were invested in world-class harbor facilities including berths, heavy machinery, rail yards, and a floating dry dock. Private enterprises worked across the Shandong Province, opening mines, banks, factories, and rail lines.
As a consequence of the First World War, Japan seized German holdings in Qingdao and Shandong. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles transferred ownership to Japan instead of restoring Chinese sovereignty over the area. Popular dissatisfaction with this outcome, referred to as the Shandong Problem, led to the vehement student protests in the May Fourth Movement. Among the reservations to the Treaty that the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations approved was &quot;to give Shantung to China&quot;, the treaty with reservations was not approved. Finally, Shandong reverted to Chinese control in 1922 after the United States&#x27; mediation during the Washington Naval Conference. Weihai followed in 1930.
Shandong&#x27;s return of control fell into the Warlord Era of the Republic of China. Shandong was handed over to the Zhili clique of warlords, but after the Second Zhili–Fengtian War of 1924, the northeast China-based Fengtian clique took over. In April 1925, the Fengtian clique installed the warlord Zhang Zongchang, nicknamed the &quot;Dogmeat General&quot;, as military governor of Shandong Province. &quot;Time&quot; dubbed him China&#x27;s &quot;basest warlord&quot;. He ruled over the province until 1928 when he was ousted in the wake of the Northern Expedition. He was succeeded by Han Fuju, who was loyal to the warlord Feng Yuxiang but later switched his allegiance to the Nanjing government headed by Chiang Kai-shek. Han Fuju also ousted the warlord Liu Zhennian, nicknamed the &quot;King of Shandong East&quot;, who ruled eastern Shandong Province, hence unifying the province under his rule.

In 1937 Japan began its invasion of China proper in the Second Sino-Japanese War, which would eventually become part of the Pacific theater of the Second World War. Han Fuju was made Deputy Commander in Chief of the 5th War Area and put in charge of defending the lower Yellow River valley. However, he abandoned his base in Jinan when Japanese troops crossed the Yellow River. He was executed for not following orders shortly thereafter.

During the Japanese occupation, with resistance continuing in the countryside, Shandong was one of the provinces where the scorched-earth Three Alls policy (&quot;kill all&quot;, &quot;burn all&quot;, and &quot;loot all&quot;) was implemented by Japanese general Yasuji Okamura. This lasted until Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945, killing millions of people in Shandong and Northern China. By 1945, communist Chinese Red Army forces already held some parts of Shandong. Over the next four years of the Chinese Civil War, they expanded their holdings, eventually driving the Kuomintang (government of the Republic of China) out of Shandong to the island of Taiwan by June 1949, including a noble of the Xiong () family who held the governorship, previously a dukedom during the imperial era, and an ancient viscountcy originating in Chu. The People&#x27;s Republic of China was proclaimed in October of that year.

Under the new government, parts of western Shandong were initially given to the short-lived Pingyuan Province, but this did not last. Shandong also acquired the Xuzhou and Lianyungang areas from Jiangsu province, but this did not last either. For the most part, Shandong has kept the same borders that it has today.

About six million people starved to death in Shandong during the Great Chinese Famine.

In recent years, Shandong, especially eastern Shandong, has enjoyed significant economic development, becoming one of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s richest provinces.

== Geography ==
Shandong is on the eastern edge of the North China Plain and in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, and extends out to sea as the Shandong Peninsula. Shandong borders the Bohai Sea to the north, Hebei to the northwest, Henan to the west, Jiangsu to the south, and the Yellow Sea to the northeast, east and southeast. It shares a short border with Anhui between Henan and Jiangsu.

The northwestern, western, and southwestern parts of the province are all part of the vast North China Plain. The province&#x27;s center is more mountainous, with Mount Tai being the most prominent. The east of the province is the hilly Shandong Peninsula extending into the sea; Miaodao Archipaelago to the north of Shandong Peninsula is the border of Bohai Sea (west) and Yellow Sea (east). The highest peak of Shandong is Jade Emperor Peak, with a height of , which is also the highest peak in the Mount Tai Ranges. 

The Yellow River passes through Shandong&#x27;s western areas, since 1855, it has always been entering the sea to Shandong&#x27;s northern coast; in Shandong, it flows on a levee, higher than the surrounding land, and dividing western Shandong into the Hai He watershed in the north and the Huai River watershed in the south. The Grand Canal of China enters Shandong from the northwest and leaves on the southwest. Weishan Lake is the largest lake in the province. Shandong&#x27;s coastline is long. Shandong Peninsula has a rocky coastline with cliffs, bays, and islands; Laizhou Bay, the southernmost of the 3 bays of the Bohai Sea, is bordering the northern coast between Dongying and Penglai; Jiaozhou Bay, which is much smaller, is surrounded by Qingdao. The Miaodao Islands extends northwards from the northernmost coast of the peninsula, separating the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea.

With Jinan serving as the province&#x27;s economic and cultural center, the province&#x27;s economic prowess has led to the development of modern coastal cities located at Qingdao, Weihai, and Yantai. 

=== Climate ===
Shandong has a temperate climate: humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;); it is bordering humid subtropical (C&quot;wa&quot; under the Köppen climate classification) in the south. Generally, summers are hot (typical max 35 °C) and rainy (except for eastern parts of Jiaodong Peninsula (typical max 28 °C) and Mount Tai (typical max 20 °C)), while winters are cold and dry. Average temperatures are in January and in July. Annual precipitation is , the vast majority of which occurs during summer, due to monsoonal influences.

=== Geology ===
Shandong is part of the Eastern Block of the North China craton. Beginning in the Mesozoic, Shandong has undergone a crustal thinning that is unusual for a craton and that has reduced the thickness of the crust from to as little as . Shandong has hence experienced extensive volcanism in the Tertiary.

Some geological formations in Shandong are rich in fossils. For example, Zhucheng in southeastern Shandong has been the site of discovering many dinosaur fossils. In 2008, about 7,600 dinosaur bones from &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, and other genera were found, likely the largest collection ever discovered at one location.

== Politics ==

The Shandong Provincial People&#x27;s Congress is the highest organ of state power in Shandong province and Shandong&#x27;s provincial legislature. Its standing committee exercises the majority of the power of The Shandong Provincial People&#x27;s Congress. The current chairman of the standing committee is Li Ganjie.

The Shandong Provincial People&#x27;s Government is the State Administration in Shandong province. Its main officials are elected and appointed by The Shandong Provincial People&#x27;s Congress. The provincial government reports to Shandong Provincial People&#x27;s Congress and State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The current Governor of Shandong is Zhou Naixiang.

== Economy ==
As of 1832, Shandong was exporting fruits, vegetables, wine, drugs, and deerskin, often heading to Guangzhou to exchange clothing and fabrics. The economy of Shandong is China&#x27;s third largest provincial economy with a GDP of CNY¥8.3 trillion in 2021 or USD$1.3 trillion in (nominal), which is equivalent to the GDP of Mexico. Its GDP per capita is around the national average. Compared to a country, it would be the 15th-largest economy and the 15th most populous as of 2021.

Shandong ranks first among the provinces in the production of a variety of products, including cotton, wheat, and garlic as well as precious metals such as gold and diamonds. It also has one of the biggest sapphire deposits in the world. Other important crops include sorghum and maize. Shandong has extensive petroleum deposits as well, especially the Shengli Oil Field (lit. Victory Oilfield) in the Dongying area in the Yellow River delta. Shandong also produces bromine from underground wells and salt from seawater. It is the largest agricultural exporter in China.

Shandong is one of China&#x27;s richest provinces, and its economic development focuses on large enterprises with well-known brand names. Shandong is the biggest industrial producer and one of the top manufacturing provinces in China. Shandong has also benefited from South Korean and Japanese investment and tourism, due to its geographical proximity to those countries. The richest part of the province is the Shandong Peninsula, where the city of Qingdao is home to three of the most well-known brand names of China: Tsingtao Beer, Haier and Hisense. Besides, Dongying&#x27;s oil fields and petroleum industries form an important component of Shandong&#x27;s economy. Despite the primacy of Shandong&#x27;s energy sector, the province has also been plagued with problems of inefficiency and ranks as the largest consumer of fossil fuels in all of China.

=== Wine industry ===

The production of wine is the second largest industry in the Shandong Province, second only to agriculture.

Geographically, the coastal areas remain relatively flat. Most of the soil is loose, well-ventilated, and rich in minerals and organic matter that enable full development of the root systems.

Presently, there are more than 140 wineries in the region, mainly distributed in the Nanwang Grape Valley and the Yan-Peng Sightseeing Highway (both are in Yantai). The region produced more than 40% of China&#x27;s grape wine production. Main varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Gernischt, Merlot, Riesling and Chardonnay are all at 20 years of age, considered to be the golden stage for these grapes. Most of them maintain an average saccharinity of above 20%.

When people speak of the &quot;Shandong dialect&quot; (), it is generally the first or the second that is meant; the Jiao Liao dialects of Shandong are commonly called the &quot;Jiaodong dialect&quot; ().

Shandong cuisine () is one of the eight great traditions of Chinese cuisine. It is known for its bread(corn-based) and fish dishes. It can be more finely divided into inland Shandong cuisine (e.g. Jinan cuisine); the seafood-centered Jiaodong cuisine in the peninsula; and Confucius&#x27;s Mansion cuisine, an elaborate tradition originally intended for imperial and other important feasts.

Shandong Bangzi and Lüju are popular types of Chinese opera in Shandong; both originated from southwestern Shandong.

<doc id="105034" wikidata="Q132671" url="?curid=105034" title="Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques">
<text>Pau (; ; ) is a commune overlooking the Pyrenees, the prefecture of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of Southwestern France.

The city is located in the heart of the former sovereign principality of Béarn, of which it was the capital from 1464. Pau lies on the Gave de Pau, and is located from the Atlantic Ocean and from Spain. This position gives it a striking panorama across the mountain range of the Pyrenees, especially from its landmark &quot;Boulevard des Pyrénées&quot;, as well as the hillsides of Jurançon. According to Alphonse de Lamartine, &quot;Pau has the world&#x27;s most beautiful view of the earth just as Naples has the most beautiful view of the sea.&quot;

The site has been occupied since at least the Gallo-Roman era. However the first references to Pau as a settlement only occur in the first half of the 12th century. The town developed from the construction of its castle, likely from the 11th century by the Viscounts of Béarn, to protect the ford which was a strategic point providing access to the Bearn valleys and to Spain. The city takes its name from the stockade (&quot;pau&quot; in Béarnese) which surrounded the original castle.

Pau became the capital of Béarn in 1464 and the seat of the Kings of Navarre in 1512 after the capture of Pamplona by the Kingdom of Castile. Pau became a leading political and intellectual centre under the reign of Henry d&#x27;Albret. With the end of Béarnaise independence in 1620, Pau lost its influence but remained at the head of a largely autonomous province. It was home to the Parliament of Navarre and Béarn during the Revolution, when it was dismantled to create the Department of Basses-Pyrénées. The Belle Époque marked a resurgence for the Béarnaise capital with a massive influx of wealthy foreign tourists, who came to spend the winter to take advantage of the benefits of Pau&#x27;s climate. It was at this time that Pau became one of the world capitals of the nascent aerospace industry under the influence of the Wright brothers.

With the decline of tourism during the 20th century, Pau&#x27;s economy gradually shifted towards the aviation industry and then to petrochemicals with the discovery of the Lacq gas field in 1951. The Université de Pau et des Pays de l&#x27;Adour, founded in 1972, accounts for a large student population. The city plays a leading role for Béarn but also for a wide segment of the Adour area. Pau&#x27;s heritage extends over several centuries, its diversity and its quality allowed it to obtain the label of City of Art and History in 2011.

The name of its people is &quot;Palois&quot; in French, and &quot;paulin&quot; in Occitan. The motto of Pau is in Latin: &quot;Urbis palladium et gentis&quot; (&quot;protective of the city and its people&quot;).

== Geography ==

=== Location ===

Pau is from the Atlantic Ocean and from the border with Spain on the Pyrenees. The frontier is crossed by the col du Somport () and the col du Pourtalet (). Access to the crossings partly accounts for Pau&#x27;s strategic importance.

Pau is located west of Toulouse, from Tarbes and Lourdes, from Oloron. The conglomeration of Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz is at , Bordeaux .

=== Communal boundaries ===
* To the north: Buros, Montardon and Morlaàs
* To the east: Bizanos and Idron
* To the south: Gelos and Jurançon
* To the west: Lons and Billère

=== Hydrography ===

The city, located at an average altitude of , is crossed by the Gave de Pau, where a ford gave passage to the Pyrenees. &quot;Gave&quot; is the name given to a torrent in the Pyrenees. The Gave de Pau, which becomes a torrent when mountain snow melts, takes its source in the Cirque de Gavarnie and is the main tributary of the Adour, into which it empties after . The crossing was used for pasturage for sheep in the high meadows. The old route is now a hiking path, GR 65, that runs south to the border.

The lands of the commune are also watered by the Luy de Béarn, a tributary the Luy, and by its tributaries, the Aïgue Longue and the Uzan, as well as the Soust, the Herrère, the Ousse and the Ousse des Bois, tributaries of the Gave de Pau. The Aygue Longue is in turn joined the territory of Pau by the Bruscos and the Lata streams, just as the Ousse is joined by the Merdé stream. The Lau Creek that feeds the Canal du Moulin, meanwhile is also present in the municipality.

=== Climate ===
Pau features wet mild winters, with warm, mild summers that are drier. Its geographical location, not far from the Pyrenees, gives the city a contrasting, warm oceanic climate. Temperatures colder than are rare and those below are exceptional. Temperatures reached lows of in February 1956 and in January 1985. Snow falls about 3 days per year ( in 1987), from November to March.

In summer, the maximum temperatures are of the order of , and temperatures above are reached very rarely. During some days of winter, the foehn, a warm wind, can raise the temperature over . As soon as the wind stops, snow can fall.

Rainfall is high, of the order of per year (compared to in Paris, in Bordeaux, and in Toulouse). Sunshine averages around 1850 hours per year, or a little less than its neighbour of the Hautes-Pyrénées, Tarbes, which averages 1940 hours of sunshine per year. Fog is infrequent and does not persist much beyond noon. The lack of wind especially characterizes the climate of the Pau region. Strong winds are very rare, in general, winds are very low or zero.

This climate has helped Pau to become, at the end of the 19th century, a winter resort spot popular with the English, Russian and Brazilian bourgeoisie. In 1842 a British doctor, Alexander Taylor, attributed healing &#x27;sedative&#x27; virtues to the Pau climate.

This mild and rather wet climate, is also an enhancement to the gardens, parks and public spaces of the city, and for plants from more exotic regions such as Chinese windmill palm (Trachycarpus fortunei), originating in the Chinese mountains, but also for giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum) and laurel magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) of American origin.

=== Toponymy ===

The origin of the name is uncertain. One tradition suggests it is a derivation of &quot;pal&quot; (fr. &quot;pieu&quot;), from the palisade around the original château. Another is that the name refers to a ford across the river administered by the church, the pious. According to Michel Grosclaude and other onomasticians, more recent research suggests the pre-Indo-European root for a rockface was &quot;*pal&quot; or &quot;*bal&quot;, and that the name refers to Pau&#x27;s position at the foot of the mountains. The palisade or pal, from the Latin &quot;palum&quot;, also has the same ancient basis but it is not under this meaning that formed the name of Pau, this can be compared to the Col de Pau in the Aspe Valley (, Lescun) which has nothing to do with the city. Its name in the Béarnese dialect is &quot;Pau&quot;.

The name of the town was recorded in the 12th century. The inhabitants of the city are known as &quot;paulins&quot; in Occitan, and &quot;palois&quot; in French. Their motto is &quot;Urbis palladium et gentis&quot;.
=== Origins ===
Before the 10th century, there are no traces to date of occupation of the site on which the city is now built. The city was built on a site with very special qualities. The Gave de Pau, which descends from the Pyrenees, was a river which was fairly difficult to cross, and for a distance of approximately , only three fords existed: from Nay to the east, from Orthez to the west and that of Pau, strategically located between the two. The northern extremity of a plateau, formed to a point, overlooks this ford of almost . In summary, it is an ideal natural location to control the passage and the arrivals from the Pyrenees, and a small monitoring station was built around the year 1000, a fort surrounded by a simple palisade.

The site was fortified in the 11th century to control the ford across the Gave de Pau. It was built on the north bank, equidistant from Lescar, seat of the bishops, and from Morlaàs.

Until the 12th century, this fort was consolidated and some houses were combined there, together, in a small hamlet. The lords of Béarn then granted the status of viguerie (a small administrative district in the Middle Ages) to this new village which continued to expand gently. In Bearnese, the palisade was called Paü. Historians agree to this being the origin of the name of the city.

In the 13th century, new recognition of the importance and the expansion of Pau, which had become the town of Castelnau, with a bailli appointed by the viscounts of Béarn.

Gaston Fébus (descendant of the counts of Foix and one of the first iconic figures of Béarn), who was very attached to the independence of his small country. He began his major work to reinforce the strongholds of Béarn, including the Château of Pau where he finally settled.

Pau was made the capital of Béarn in 1464, instead of Orthez. During the early 16th century, the Château de Pau became the residence of the Kings of Navarre, who were also viscounts of Béarn.

Pau is the only city in Europe in which two founders of royal dynasties were born: Henry IV of France of the House of Bourbon, born in 1553, and Charles XIV John of Sweden of the House of Bernadotte, born in 1763.

==== Middle Ages ====
Pau was a castelnau founded at an unknown date, in the second half of the 11th or the very beginning of the 12th century, to control a fording of the Gave de Pau which was used for the passage of the shepherds in transhumance between the mountains of Ossau and pasture of the plain of the Pont-Long. A castle was built, overlooking the north bank, at equal distance from Lescar, seat of the bishops, and from Morlaàs, capital of the Viscounts of Béarn.

In 1188, Gaston VI assembled his &quot;&quot; there, predecessor of the &quot;conseil souverain&quot; and roughly equivalent to the House of Lords. Gaston VII added a third tower in the 13th century. Gaston Fébus (Gaston III of Foix and Gaston X of Béarn) added a brick donjon (keep), known as &quot;la tour Billère&quot; [the Tower of Billère].

==== 16th–18th century ====
In 1464, Gaston IV of Foix-Béarn, after he married the Infanta Eleanor of Aragon, transferred his Court of Orthez to Pau. Pau thus became the fourth historic capital of Béarn, after Lescar, Morlaàs and Orthez. The city had a municipal charter; fairs took place, like the Béarn states. He transformed the curtain walls of his castle home.

In 1512, it became the capital of the Kings of Navarre, who were refugees north of the Pyrenees, after the capture of Pamplona by the Spaniards. In 1520, it had a sovereign council and a chamber of accounts.

In 1527, Henri d&#x27;Albret, King of Navarre and sovereign viscountcy of Béarn, married Marguerite of Angoulême, sister of Francis I of France: She transformed the château in the Renaissance style and created its gardens.

In 1553, his daughter, Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, gave birth to Henry III of Navarre by singing a song of Béarn to the Virgin Mary, so that the future Henry IV was &quot;neither fearful nor balked.&quot; She had crossed into France to ensure her son would be born there. The baby&#x27;s lips were moistened with the local Jurançon wine and rubbed with garlic shortly after birth. When Henry IV left Pau to become King of France, he remarked to local notables that he was not giving Béarn to France, but giving France to Béarn.
The troops of Charles IX took the city, but d&#x27;Albret took over in 1569. Catherine of Bourbon, sister of Henri IV, governed Béarn in his place.

In 1619, Pau revolted. Louis XIII occupied it and, after receiving the submission of the fortified town of Navarrenx, pronounced the attachment of Béarn and Navarre to France by the edict of 20 October 1620. It thus transformed the sovereign Council of Béarn in the Parliament of Navarre, joining the future courses of Pau and Saint-Palais.

Pau had a new enclosure in 1649, and then a university in 1722.

King Charles XIV of Sweden, the first royal Bernadotte, was born in Pau in the 18th century.

On 14 October 1790, it was declared, after Navarrenx, the new capital of the Department of Basses-Pyrénées. This status was removed on 11 October 1795 in favor of Oloron, then made permanent on 5 March 1796.

==== 19th century ====

Napoleon expressed his interest and helped to save the château, which became a prison for a time. In 1838, Louis-Philippe did boldly restore it, to highlight the medieval and Renaissance character. Napoleon III added a double tower framing a false entry, to the West. He also added streets of Belle Époque architecture, before the fashion transferred to Biarritz.

After the July Monarchy, Pau became, between 1830 and 1914, had the most famous climate and sports resort in Western Europe. In 1842, the Scottish physician Alexander Taylor (1802–1879) advocated Pau for a winter cure. The success of his work was important and Pau became a holiday resort for the British. In 1876, there were 28,908 inhabitants of Pau. The English settled there and took advantage of the first golf on the continent, of fox hunting (Pau fox hunt), and held races at the Pont-Long Racecourse. From the 1870s the &quot;Boulevard du Midi&quot; was gradually extended to the east and west to form the current &quot;Boulevard des Pyrénées&quot;, the lavish Winter Palace – with a palmarium; and internationally renowned hotels, the Gassion and the France, which offered a majestic and luxurious setting for concerts and receptions to take place.
From 1894, Pau was served by a network of horse tramways. A few years later, electric traction was commissioned by the Béarnaise Society of Urban Streetcars. The network consisted of three lines, with a length of . It disappeared in 1931. The town of Pau was also served by the Pau-Oloron-Mauléon railway (POM), whose main station was found at the &quot;Place de la République&quot;. Three lines served Monein, Pontacq and Lembeye. Steam traction was used on the network, which disappeared in December 1931.

While the upper town thrived because of the coming of the rich European tourists, the lower city specialised in industry. Many small structures gradually developed at the foot of the château, the production focused on textiles and the food industry. Many of them marked this industrial fabric, such as Courriades dyes, the Heïd flour mill and the tram factory.

Mary Todd Lincoln, the widow of the American president, also lived in Pau for several years in the late 1870s.

==== 20th century ====
At the beginning of the 20th century, Pau was still a resort town where European nobility spent the winter. Good English, American, Russian, Spanish or Prussian society met in the Béarnaise city. Many public amenities were from this period, including the Pau Funicular to connect the station to the upper town. Next to these public amenities, wealthy foreign visitors were building villas to improve the conditions of their stay. First built in the centre of town, these residences spread out more and more to enjoy the great outdoors and views of the Pyrenees. Between 1850 and 1910, many residences were thus built and still evoke the splendour of this period, today. This golden period of climate tourism in Pau stopped abruptly at the outbreak of World War I.

The first balloon flights took place in Pau in 1844 and the first flights by plane, from 1909, the year in which the Wright brothers transferred to Pau (on the moor of Pont-Long, in commune of Lescar). They had originally initiated a first aviation school at Le Mans (Sarthe Department), formed of three student pilots, who they were committed to train in France. Pau alone hosted seven global aircraft manufacturers until 1914 and became the world capital of aviation. The military aviation school, which trained the flying aces of World War I, then the fighter school of France, settled there. French aviators Thénault, Simon, Paul Codos, Georges Bellenger Bellenger, Garros, Nungesser, Guynemer, and the Béarnais aviators Artigau and Mace, among many others, and finally the American aviators Lufbery, Thaw, Chapman, Prince and the McConnell brothers, were among those who flew there.

Pau hosted the 18th régiment d&#x27;infanterie, 1st and 18th Parachute Chasseur Regimen (parachute regiment) who were stationed in the town. All participated in the various conflicts of the 20th century. The 18th RCP was dissolved in 1961, due to having contributed to the putsch of the generals of Algiers. It had previously participated in the May 1958 crisis which had ended the Fourth Republic. The 1st RCP remained in barracks in 1983 in Idron camp when one of its elements was struck in Beirut by the attack of the Drakkar building, which had 58 victims among its troops.

During World War II, the Continental Hotel collected many refugees, including Jews hounded by Vichy and the Nazis, even when the soldiers of the Wehrmacht requisitioned two floors of the hotel.

From 1947, during the four mandates of Mayor Louis Sallenave, the town of Pau experienced strong growth. In 1957, exploitation of the Lacq gas field, discovered in 1951, gave new momentum to the region with the industrial development of Béarn and the Lacq area (SNPA, EDF, Pechiney and Rhône-Poulenc being the most important employers), the population of the town doubled in 20 years. Major infrastructure projects were carried out, such as the construction of several schools representing more than 100 classes, creation of the Pau-Uzein airport in 1955 (now the Pau Pyrénées Airport) to modernise the old Pau-Pont-Long airfield (in the commune of Lescar), creation of social housing (all of the &quot;Ousse des Bois&quot; in 1961, and Dufau Terrace from 1962), creation of the exhibition centre, the University of Pau and Pays de l&#x27;Adour and construction of a second bridge over the River Gave in Jurançon. A vast town planning scheme allowed the extension of the commune to the north through the &quot;coulée verte&quot; [green corridor]. The configuration of the city shortly moved from the end of the 1960s. The fame and prestige of the city increased thanks to the conference of the Indochinese States from June to November 1950, visits of Heads of State such as president Charles de Gaulle in February 1959 and the first Secretary of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev, travelling in Lacq in 1960.

André Labarrère, mayor from 1971 to 2006, worked towards a first step of the beautification of the city. Within its recent mandates, on the outskirts, the university was expanding and the Pau-Pyrénées was one of the first in France to develop a fibre-optic network, infrastructure offering a very high-speed internet access both to individuals and companies. New facilities were created, including sports, such as the Zénith de Pau}, the Palais des Sports, the Jaï Alaï, and the artificial whitewater arena. The city acquired an important centre of health. The racecourse and the airport (depending on CCI) were renovated. The centre of town also saw significant upheavals with the rehabilitation of the Palais Beaumont and the construction of a new private commercial centre named &quot;Centre Bosquet&quot;. Pau finally embarked on the pedestrianisation of its centre with the reconfiguration of its bus network, the renovation of the Place Clemenceau, the central square of Pau, and the modernisation of the &quot;Palais des Pyrénées&quot;, a shopping centre in the city centre, near to the &quot;Place Clemenceau&quot;. New underground parking compensated for the removal of 400 parking spaces on the surface; also two underground car parks gained redesigned access. Finally, a media library was created in 2012 in the Les Halles quarter.

==== 21st century ====
In 2008, at the end of a bitter political struggle, which included François Bayrou, Martine Lignières-Cassou became mayor of Pau. During this term, she included the rebuilding of the water stadium and making the &quot;Rue Joffre&quot; pedestrian. She also allowed the realisation of the City of the Pyrénées which brought different associations related to Pyreneeism into one place.

In 2014, François Bayrou became mayor, after standing against David Habib in the election. Bayrou was clearly ahead in the second round of voting.

Bayrou was named Prime Minister of France in December 2024, but vowed to stay on as mayor.

*Ham known as &quot;de Bayonne&quot; is in fact a Béarnese ham, made from the pigs of the Aspe and Ossau Valleys. This ham was historically salted at Salies-de-Béarn then exported via the Adour River from the port of Bayonne, from where the incorrect name of &quot;jambon de Bayonne&quot; [Bayonne ham] arose. Today, the bulk of Bayonne ham is made in Bearn. Pork, and in particular the black pig, was introduced in the Basque country in the 1960s to deal with a serious agricultural crisis

=== Restaurants and bars ===

The Béarnaise capital has several quarters which are particularly animated at night, including the quarters of the triangle, the &quot;Boulevard des Pyrénées&quot; and also &quot;Rue des Orphelines&quot;.

== Culture ==

The town of Pau is marked by a strong cultural identity, with the presence of a French-Occitan bilingual school (calandreta &quot;Paulina&quot;) (90 students) in Pau and one in the metropolitan area in Lescar (60 students), by a living practice of Béarnese and the success of the Occitan cultural groups. The city has, however, received foreign influences of major importance (English, Spanish, Russian, Brazilian) and remains very open to the outside with a large English student community, along with the presence of Dutch, Portuguese, Spaniards and Moroccans. Near Dax, Bayonne and Biarritz, the Pau people have a love of city ferias. The bandas, bodegas (drinking places with typical animation) and Béarnese singing groups are numerous including &quot;Nadau&quot;, &quot;Lo Cèu de Pau&quot; and &quot;Balaguera&quot;. Since 2005, the city hosts the festival Hestiv&#x27;oc which is the grand festival of Occitania. The University of Pau, Université de Pau et des Pays de l&#x27;Adour, also often hosts concerts and cultural events.

The Association of the Palois and Béarnese in Paris, &quot;La Garbure&quot;, was founded around 1890 by a Béarnese pharmacist who went to the capital to open a shop on Boulevard Haussmann. The history of this association, which has never had official status, is transmitted only orally. However, the original spirit remains the same. The &quot;expatriates&quot; meet two or three times a year in a friendly atmosphere to speak of the country around a good meal. Without issue, and without political dimension, although politicians like Louis Barthou, François Bayrou and others have never neglected this &quot;sounding board&quot; which also brings together celebrities from entertainment, from information and from gastronomy.

=== Language ===
The Béarnese state language, before 1789, was a Gascon dialect of Occitan. For the anecdote, there is an English-Béarnese dictionary for the use of the British who were vacationing in Pau. One theory of the origin of the word &quot;caddie&quot; was that it was formed at Pau Golf Club (Billère) from the Béarnese &quot;capdèth&quot;.

The Ostau Bearnés is a Pau organization bringing together all who practice or teach the language.

=== Centres and cultural facilities ===

=== Events ===
Since 1930, Pau has become a mainstay of the Tour de France cycling race, thanks both to its geographical location and to its marvelous infrastructure. Pau hosted its 63rd stage in 2010, and only one other city besides Paris has done better. The 2010 Tour visited Pau on three occasions: First as a passing town, second time as a finish, and the third time as a departure town on the way to the Col du Tourmalet. Pau is behind Bordeaux as the town of the province to have had most stages in the history of the Tour. Pau will receive the Tour for the 75th time in 2024.

Perhaps the highest-profile sporting event is the Étoiles de Pau (&quot;Stars of Pau&quot;). Held annually in October, it is one of only six annual competitions in eventing that receive the highest rating of CCI**** from equestrianism&#x27;s world governing body, the FEI. It&#x27;s also the only event of this level in France.

==== Pau Grand Prix ====


Pau held the first race to be called a Grand Prix in 1901. After that the 1928 French Grand Prix was held in nearby Saint-Gaudens, Pau also wanted to arrange the race and in 1930 the French Grand Prix was held on a Le Mans-type track outside the city with Philippe Étancelin winning for Bugatti. Pau returned to the calendar in 1933 with a track in the town centre inspired by Monaco.

The track, long, is winding and has remained largely unchanged. The first curve is the station hairpin. After that the road climbs on the Avenue Léon Say, alongside the stone viaduct that carries the Boulevard de Pyrenées, to Pont Oscar. A tunnel is followed by the narrow hairpin at the Louis Barthou high school that leads the track into the demanding Parc Beaumont section at the top of the town. After the Casino garden and another hairpin, the track winds back to the start along the Avenue Lacoste.

Pau traditionally opened the season but mid-February for the 1933 GP meant the race took place in a snowstorm with slush. After a one-year pause the race was back in 1935 with Tazio Nuvolari dominating in an Alfa Romeo P3 entered by Scuderia Ferrari. The 1936 race saw the only major victory for the Maserati V8-R1, driven by Ètancelin. In 1937 the race was part of the French sports car series with Jean-Pierre Wimille dominating, running three to four seconds a lap faster than the rest of the field. GP racing was back in 1938 and Pau became a test track for Mercedes-Benz before the Grandes Epreuves.

The 1938 race saw René Dreyfus&#x27; Delahaye sensationally beating the Mercedes-Benz team. In 1939 Mercedes wasn&#x27;t to be taken by surprise, Hermann Lang leading the team to a double victory. After World War II Pau continued as a non-championship Formula One race until 1963. Thereafter the race was run to Formula Two rules until 1985, and thereafter by its replacement, Formula 3000. In 1999, the event again changed, with Formula Three cars racing. Finally, in 2007, the race became a round of the World Touring Car Championship.

The &quot;Grand Prix de Pau Historique&quot; is organized on the Circuit de Pau-Ville once a year, a week before or after the modern Grand Prix, this event brings together vehicles with animated racing of the past.

== Economy ==

From the 1950s to the 1990s Pau depended on the production of natural gas and sulphur which were discovered nearby at Lacq. In the 21st century, the mainstays of the Béarn area are the oil business, the aerospace industry through the helicopter turboshaft engines manufacturer Turbomeca, tourism and agriculture. Pau was the birthplace of Elf Aquitaine, which has now become a part of TotalEnergies. Halliburton has an office in Pau.

Pau is the second economic hub of Aquitaine, after Bordeaux. A university city, it has concentrated several industrial centres and centres of important research in the fields of petroleum engineering and geosciences, petrochemistry and chemistry, food, automotive, aeronautics and computer science.

Pau benefits from its central location in the region of the &quot;Pays de l&#x27;Adour&quot; and its location between two major areas of population: Bayonne/Anglet/Biarritz (160,000 inhabitants) and the area of Tarbes/Lourdes (110,000 inhabitants) and secondary, more diffuse, areas: South of Landes/Dax (90,000 inhabitants) and the areas of Auch (40,000 inhabitants), Orthez/Lacq (30,000 inhabitants) and Oloron (20,000 inhabitants).

The municipality is partially within the Ossau-Iraty AOC area.

*Tertiary functions: administrative (prefecture, general council, etc.), cultural (university), judicial ( Court of Appeal), commercial.
*Science Centre and technology Jean-Feger, of the oil group TotalEnergies (formerly Elf Aquitaine).
*The Research Centre.
*The Technopoles of Hélioparc, Pau Cité Multimédia and Pole E-Business southern Aquitaine (PEBA).
*Aeronautical and space industry.
*Electrical industry.
*Food and wine industries.
*Fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industry.
*Computer science, NTIC.
*&quot;Pau Broadband Country&quot; ().
*Business travel, seminars, congresses.

=== Industry ===

Pau experienced an important economic boom based on the discovery of the giant deposit of natural gas in Lacq. Discovered in the 1950s (by engineer Jean Féger), it was then the largest terrestrial deposit of gas in Europe and helped France to be self-sufficient in gas for almost thirty years. The &quot;Société Nationale des Pétroles d&#x27;Aquitaine&quot; (SNPA) was born at Lacq in 1941, after merger with ELF in 1976 it became part of the Elf Aquitaine group, then Total during its integration into the Group TotalFinaElf (in Lacq, known now the SNEAP, Société Nationale Elf Aquitaine Production). Oil and focussed businesses (Total Exploration Production France, TotalEnergies, Total infrastructure Gaz France (TIGF), Schlumberger, Halliburton) and chemical (Arkema, Air Liquide) settled in Pau or the surrounding area (in Lacq at the Chemparc chemical park but also in Pardies and Artix).

The scientific centre of Total in Pau is one research centre for exploration and production of gas and oil in Europe, more than 2,000 people, including 900 doctors and engineers in the geosciences, resulting from the merger of ELF Aquitaine and Total. Research in the geosciences is also based on university partnerships/companies notably with the Federation of research applied to petroleum engineering (IPRA), consisting of teams of research CNRS/University of Pau and the Pays de l&#x27;Adour (UPPA) and Total (the IPRA represents 130 teachers, researchers and beneficiaries, an annual budget of 1.5 million euros and six scientific Masters). Research and engineering in the geosciences are also present through specialised companies (CGG, Paradigm Geophysical, TTI, VERITAS, etc.) implanted, for the most part, on the site of the Hélioparc technopole and specialised training centres (IFP Training, NExT-Schlumberger, Wellstaff, Baker Hughes, etc.).

The area of Pau-Lacq is also geared towards fine chemicals (Acetex, now closed) and new materials. High-tech composite materials and nanomaterials have gradually been developed in Béarn with the Carbon Fibre Company (SOFICAR) and the GRL (Group of research of Lacq), one of the main centres of research of ARKEMA.

Industry has also developed recently around new energy investments and other energies: Bio-fuels (manufacturing site of bioethanol from the AB Bioenergy France Company, €150M investment), biomass (cellulose) and the production of electricity from gas (production site of SNET, investment of €400M). One driver of uptake and CO2 sequestration process is also underway (industrial investment of €100M).

Ultimately, these activities for fine chemicals and specialties, will ensure the reconversion of the traditional activities of extraction from the Lacq area.

The entire energy complex (Chemparc) now represents 12,000 direct jobs.

Pau is part of the global competitiveness cluster of Aerospace Valley, in the aerospace sector, with Toulouse and Bordeaux. The aviation industry is represented by major industrial groups (Safran, Turbomeca, Messier Dowty, Examéca, MAP, etc.), and a significant number of subcontractors. With Biarritz/Bayonne (Dassault) and Tarbes (EADS Socata, Tarmac), the area of the Pays de l&#x27;Adour is strongly oriented towards aeronautics (12,000 jobs). These firms are involved on the Airbus programmes of A380/A300/A330/A320 (landing gear, carbon fibre, welding, aerostructures), Eurocopter (engines, machining parts), Boeing (landing gear) and Embraer. Pau also hosts the service centre of the French Army (ALAT) Tiger helicopters. The airport area in particular (aeropole Pau Pyrénées) is expanding and includes aeronautical and automotive subcontractors.

The pharmaceutical sector is growing and is represented by Pierre Fabre, Boiron, Sanofi and Finorga companies. A bio-health centre grouping of industrial pharmacy and biology was created in 2006 around the Pierre Fabre and DBI enterprises.

The Pau economy is also based on the agri-food industry in the fields of maize, processed products (dairy products, canning, meat) and the wine industry (Group , Candia, Bongrain, 3A, Michaud and Miot). With 400 researchers, Pau is the first European research centre for maize-growing.

The electronics and electrical engineering sector also has several industrial sites in the Pau agglomeration (Legrand, Arelec, Aquitaine electronics, Siemens).

=== Services ===

Pau also concentrates the regional headquarters of many service companies as capital of the &quot;Pays de l&#x27;Adour&quot; region: The banking sector (CA Pyrénées Gascogne, Banque Pouyanne), insurance (MIF, MSA), construction (Groupe MAS, Cance) and business services (APR, YSA, Vitalicom).

ICT businesses have experienced an important development with the deployment of optical fibre in the agglomeration and the implantation of companies specialising in information technology, networks and image processing. The technopoles [technological hubs] of &quot;Helioparc&quot; (close to the university, 1,000 jobs), &quot;Pau Cité Multimédia&quot; (north of the town, 700 jobs) and the &quot;@LLEES&quot; (Villa Ridgway built in 1905, former headquarters of Elf) concentrate a large number of systems integration and computer engineering information technology consulting schools. Pau should, ultimately, be fully connected to a fibre optic network (Pau Broadband Country) of the agglomeration of Pau-Pyrénées communities which will allow a data transfer rate of 10 to 100 megabits per second (and 1 gigabit per second for some companies) and applications of types such as VoIP, online services and &quot;webTV&quot;. Pau is the third city in Europe, after Stockholm and Milan, to have developed a very high-speed fibre optic network. The project has cost 30 million euros and has been spread over five years. This network has encouraged the location of French and foreign companies to Pau, which are specialised in imaging, services or design online.

Pau combines all the functions and administrative headquarters of a regional agglomeration: , Court of Appeal for the departments under the purview of Pau (Pyrenees Atlantiques, Landes and Gers), the regional hospital, , Chamber of Trade of Pyrénées Atlantiques, Chamber of Agriculture of Pyrénées Atlantiques, SDIS 64, Université de Pau et des Pays de l&#x27;Adour. The Chamber of commerce and industry of Pau Béarn manages the Pau-Pyrénées airport, the Groupe ESC Pau, the consular hotel, the CNPC and the IPC de Pau.

In 2006, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Pau Béarn had 11,000 industrial and commercial companies registered as headquartered in Pau.

Pau is also a city of congress, symposia and business travelers with infrastructure allowing it to host national and international events. The Congress Centre, a casino, a park of exhibitions and 4-star hotels (Parc Beaumont Hotel, Villa Navarre Hotel) all help to provide this infrastructure.

The town of Pau is home to many corps of the army. The (RHC), which was the first regiment of France to be equipped with the new Eurocopter Tiger, the school of airborne troops (ETAP), the staff of the special forces land brigade, its air component (DAOS), and the central military administrative archive () office. The defence sector represents a little more than 2,000 direct jobs in Pau.

=== Tourism ===

The town of Pau is located 45 minutes from the Pyrenees and its ski resorts. It is a holiday resort for tourists to the Pyrenees (hiking, climbing, skiing) and Spain. Located near the Basque and Landes coasts (an hour&#x27;s drive), it is possible to practice water sports (surfing, diving, sailing, etc.).

Pau is the gateway to the five Béarnese valleys (the Ossau Valley, Vallée d&#x27;Aspe, , the and Vath-Vielha) that receives winter sports tourists (the ski resorts of Gourette, Artouste, and ), spas (Eaux-Bonnes and Eaux-Chaudes) and green tourism (white-water sports, cultural and gastronomic tourism).

Its location at the foot of the Pyrenees gives Pau an exceptional panorama of the chain of the Pyrenees, in particular from the Boulevard des Pyrénées which is a long avenue of , facing the Pyrenees mountain range.

Pau, a former royal town and capital of Béarn, is also a city of cultural tourism and important business (Congress, conferences, notably in the ). The city, a former climatic health resort, also hosts a casino (the &quot;Casino de Pau&quot;).

The city is historically closely linked to the United Kingdom and remains popular with the British on holiday. The British discovered Pau and its climate, and left their imprint when Wellington left a garrison there in 1814. He defeated Marshal Soult at Orthez (some to the north-west) on his way into France from Spain towards the end of the Peninsular War. Vacationing British began arriving before the railway established the Boulevard des Pyrenées. The first full 18-hole golf course in Europe, created by people from Scotland, and in fact located at Billère, was laid out in 1856–1860 and is still in existence, and also a real tennis court. Spanish people are also very present in the city, as well as Portuguese and Moroccans (consulates of Spain and Portugal). The Germans and Dutch, attracted by the climate of Pau and its heritage, are also more and more numerous.

== Heritage ==
Pau has a heritage which stretches from the 12th to the 21st century, which is represented through numerous sites and monuments, including the castle of Henri IV.

=== Religious monuments ===

==== Main Catholic churches ====
* The Church of Saint-Martin is situated in the centre of the old town, on Rue Henri IV. It was designed according to the plans of the architect Émile Boeswillwald. The construction of the church, of neo-Gothic influence, began in the 1860s. Every Sunday, the automatic carillon of St. Martin peals the notes of &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot; and the &quot;Twelve Variations on &quot;Ah vous dirai-je, Maman&quot;&quot;, by Mozart.
* The Church of Saint-Jacques, also of Gothic influence, regained its two spires in 2012. Following the ancient chapel of the convent of the Cordeliers, it was completed in 1867. Its spires had been removed in 2001, due to being weakened by a storm in 1999.
* The Notre-Dame Church is capped by a monumental statue of the Virgin and child of Art Deco inspiration. The church was built in the first half of the 20th century, in continuity with the ancient church dedicated to the pilgrimage which came before.
* The Church of Saint-Joseph was designed by the architect . It was built in 1935. Neo-Byzantine style, it is recognizable because of its domes and its bell tower, which is high and of reinforced cement.
* St Peter&#x27;s Church was built in 1970. It was designed by the Prix de Rome architect . Largely covered with slates, it has married its modern structure with concrete buildings which surround it.

==== Outstanding Catholic chapels ====

*The former Convent of the Réparatrices, an imposing chapel, now houses the National School of Music and Dance and combines ancient and contemporary architecture.
*The Chapel of Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague, classic architecture, accompanied by the establishment of a college of Jesuits (current Lycée Louis-Barthou). Begun in the 1660s, it was not completed until 1851.
* The Chapel of Notre-Dame-du-bout-du-Pont, the former place of worship of the Ursulines de Pau, was built in 1872 and relocated in 1932. The Ursuline convent was, in fact, demolished to give space to the &quot;Palais des Pyrénées&quot; on the current . The chapel was dismantled stone by stone (each being numbered) and then rebuilt at its present location across the Gave de Pau.
* The Chapel of the Château de Pau, visible from the main entrance, is adjacent to the brick keep.

==== Reformed, Anglican and Presbyterian churches ====
* In the 16th century, slaughterhouses were constructed along with the , the cagots worked on the two buildings.
* Responding to demand from English residents, Christ Church was built on the &quot;Rue Serviez&quot; from 1837 to 1841. Since then, it has become a Reformed temple.
* Similarly, the Anglican Church of Saint Andrew was built in 1866. The rectory is known to be shaped according to local taste, the façade is dotted with pebbles from the Gave de Pau.
* The Méliès Cinema was housed in a former place of worship, a Scottish Presbyterian Church.

==== Other religious buildings ====
Pau has a Russian Orthodox Church, a mosque, a synagogue and a number of smaller churches such as St-Jean-Baptiste, Sainte-Bernadette and Sainte-Thérèse.

=== Civil monuments ===

==== Until the 18th century ====

The Château de Pau dominates the Gave de Pau. Its two oldest towers date from the 12th century. The quadrangular tower of brick was raised by Sicard de Lordat in the 14th century. Thus constituted fortress was turned into a Renaissance palace by Marguerite d&#x27;Angoulême and then restored under Louis-Philippe and Napoleon III. In summary, the castle was fortress of the Viscounts of Béarn, Castle of Fébus, birthplace of the good King Henry IV (&quot;Nouste Enric&quot;) and royal residence in the Renaissance.

A first defensive tower desired below the castle by Gaston Fébus, then called the &quot;Tour du Moulin&quot; [tower of the mill] for a time, was built along a water channel operating the mill of the castle as early as the 15th century. The &quot;Tour de la Monnaie&quot; [Money Tower] was named according to Henri d&#x27;Albret who, in 1554, used it as a mint. Today containing a lift within, it was used for the coinage of money until the French Revolution.

Its small garden was tended by Marie Antoinette when she spent her summers in the city. Napoleon used it as a holiday home during his period in power. The château has been designated as a French historical monument and holds a collection of tapestries.


Close to the castle, the &quot;Parlement de Navarre&quot; [Parliament of Navarre], so named, saw its origins in the annexation of Béarn to the Crown of France under Louis XIII in 1620. Though, in fact, he established himself in a very old courthouse that had been built as early as 1585 in place of the house of the Bishop of Lescar. Burned down in 1716, it was rebuilt but quickly abandoned in favour of the current courthouse. The General Council settled there and it still holds its sessions.
Lycée Louis Barthou, originally a Jesuit college, was built in Louis XIII&#x27;s appeal, probably between 1622 and 1645, for the restoration of Catholicism. It has illustrious alumni such as Lautréamont, Louis Barthou, Saint-John Perse, Pierre Bourdieu, Daniel Balavoine and Henri Emmanuelli.
The Birthplace of Bernadotte Museum is today of particular interest to Swedish tourists, it dates from the 18th century. Bernadotte was a French non-commissioned officer who was born in Pau and became a general of Napoleon and then King of Sweden under the name Charles XIV.

==== In the 19th century ====
Former grand hotels of the Belle Époque which were in direct competition, the &quot;Hotel de Gassion&quot; and the &quot;Hotel de France&quot;, are located on the &quot;Boulevard des Pyrénées&quot;. The &quot;Hotel de Gassion&quot;, located between the château and the Church of Saint-Martin, now houses apartments. The &quot;Hotel de France&quot;, located to the east of the &quot;Place Royale&quot;, now houses the services of the Communauté d&#x27;agglomération de Pau-Pyrénées and is the second decision-making centre in Pau.
The &quot;Palais Beaumont&quot;, originally referred to as the &quot;Palais d&#x27;Hiver&quot; [Winter Palace], was created at the end of the 19th century. Mixing architectural styles, it was repeatedly altered and was renovated from 1996, after half a century of neglect. It hosts a casino but is primarily a convention centre, a space for events such as seminars and fairs.
The funicular, which joins with the upper town, the historic centre, has carried travellers to and from the railway station, since 1908.
Municipal services settled in the current premises of the Hôtel de Ville in 1876. The building, located north of the , is actually a former theatre dating from 1862. The project to erect the Church of Saint-Louis, on the site, launched in 1685 and revived in 1788, was never successful.

The climate tourism which took over in Pau has left a set of prestigious villas as a legacy. Rich English, American and Russian tourists built villas to facilitate their stay during the winter. These buildings, English-style, were mainly built at the end of the 19th century. These villas now have various uses such as a charming hotel (Villa Navarre, an Anglo-Norman Manor built between 1865 and 1870), a reception room (Villa Saint Basil&#x27;s built in 1889), apartments (Palais Sorrento in 1888) and as a residence of the prefect (Villa Saint Helena) etc.

The current courthouse was built on the territory of the former convent of the Cordeliers. The &quot;Place de la Libération&quot; today participates in the majesty of a building whose façade is classically decorated with columns, themselves topped by a pediment in white marble. Its construction began in 1847.

The railway station, of Eiffel style, was inaugurated in 1871 below the city centre.
It was natural that a barracks was progressively built in Pau from 1825 to 1875, the prefectural town close to the border. The Bernadotte Barracks, which today contains the national archives of the army, thus welcomed two regiments as early as 1830. The current which has become parking and was formerly known as &quot;Place Napoleon&quot;, was, in fact, an area of close exercises.

==== Of the 20th century to the present day ====

*Inaugurated in 2000 at the foot of the original Parliament of Navarre, the Hôtel du Département [Departmental Administrative Building], a building of glass on which some buildings of the &quot;Boulevard des Pyrénées&quot; are reflected, now includes all administrative services linked to it.
*Renovated in 2007, the Bosquet Centre, is a shopping centre of contemporary architecture in the centre of town. Borrowing its name from Marshal Bosquet who has a nearby statue, it was built on the site of the former Hospital of Pau.
*The &quot;Palais des Pyrénées&quot; [Palace of the Pyrenees], the second shopping centre in the heart of the city, has had a tumultuous history. In its current form, it seems to have regained its spirit of 1808, that of the &quot;Passage of Napoleon&quot;, a commercial route which heralded the modern covered market of 1838, destroyed at the beginning of the 20th century. The &quot;Palais des Pyrenees&quot; from 1930, or the &quot;Palais du Commerce et des Fêtes&quot; [Palace of trade and celebrations], was an art-deco complex covered with shops but also theatres, a casino and even a mini golf course. Return to its original condition began in 1951 with the removal of the roofing over the central path, Pau people regained views of the Pyrenees. Four buildings were then raised. It was in 2006 which it appeared in its current form, proud of its canopies of glass and steel.
*Since 1971, the &quot;Archives Départementales&quot; [Departmental Archives] have settled into two buildings, one of them of particularly atypical appearance due to its tiny triangular windows, which are designed to give the best protection to the preserved documents.
*The &quot;Archives Communautaires de l&#x27;Agglomération de Pau-Pyrénées &quot; [Community Archives of the Agglomeration of Pau-Pyrénées] are grouped, since March 2011, in the buildings of the former tram factory (on the site of what was previously a gas plant, as evidenced by the high chimney).
*The &quot;Faculté de Lettres et Sciences Humaines&quot; [Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences], and the &quot;Maison de l&#x27;Agriculture&quot; [House of Agriculture], with similar architectures dating from the start of the 1970s, break in their likeness as the first seems to humbly blend in with the vegetation, while the second seems to display a relative majesty.

=== Outstanding built-up areas ===

==== Town squares ====
* and the &quot;Palais des Pyrénées&quot;, the market square and centre commercial-street. In the heart of the downtown area, this is the site of many public festivals, shopping, and a fountain.
*&quot;Place d&#x27;Espagne&quot; [Spain Square]: Containing buildings of contemporary architecture as well as the Bosquet commercial centre
*&quot;Place des sept cantons&quot; [Seven Cantons Square]: This square is joined to not seven but six streets
*&quot;Place des États&quot; [States Square]: The crossroads of transhumance until the Renaissance era, in the area of the Château de Pau
*: An architectural ensemble from the 18th century, with many summer terraces
* [Queen Marguerite Square]: bordered by arcades with pebbled arches, it once was the marketplace, and a gallows and wheel for executions once stood here
*: Created by Louis XIV, it was built in its present form with a statue of Henry IV during the reign of Louis Philippe. It includes the Pau Town Hall
*: A large square today occupied by ample free parking and bordered to the west by the Bernadotte military barracks
*&quot;Place de la Libération&quot;: The Palace of Justice and the Santiago Church are in this square

==== Streets ====

*The &quot;Boulevard des Pyrénées&quot;, created on the initiative of Napoleon I as a continuation of the &quot;Place Royale&quot;, is long. The panoramic view from the boulevard extends beyond the hills of Gelos and Jurançon to include the Pic d&#x27;Anie at , the Pic du Midi de Bigorre at which is topped with an astronomical observatory known worldwide for the quality of its solar and planetary photographs (NASA used it to prepare for the Apollo missions), the Midi d&#x27;Ossau at is of volcanic nature and of distinctive and symbolic shape, as well as Balaïtous at and the Vignemale at , the highest peak in the French Pyrenees. One of the peculiarities of this avenue overlooking the Pyrenees is the presence of plates of orientation, allowing an alignment with a lightning rod on a factory chimney below, for recognizing the great peaks of the mountain range.
*The &quot;Rue du Maréchal-Joffre&quot; connects the Château Quarter to &quot;Place Clemenceau&quot;, it was first named &quot;Grande Rue&quot; and helped Pau to expand eastward at the end of the Middle Ages. The street assured freedom of movement for traffic as much as it helped to distribute the housing. The large houses of the parliamentarians and notables, from the different eras, can show their façades or give a more discreet entry to the rear of the houses. The revenue houses, smaller but just as numerous, punctuate the blocks with the succession of their bays. The merchant past is recalled by the presence of the arches of the &quot;Place de la Vieille-Halle&quot; (&quot;Place Reine-Marguerite&quot;). The &quot;Rue du Maréchal-Joffre&quot; is now fully paved and pedestrianised, after work undertaken between 2011 and 2012.

==== Typical districts ====

*The Château Quarter: The historic quarter of Pau in the narrow old lanes, which gives the quarter a medieval appearance.
*The Hedås Quarter: An old quarter which was built in a ravine which previously crossed a stream, in the heart of the historic city.

*The Trespoey Quarter: A very wooded area with many 19th century English-style villas. It is the area of the city of the more bourgeois, historically upmarket. The most prestigious hotels in the city are now here, such as the &quot;Villa Navarre&quot; and the &quot;Beaumont&quot;.
=== Environmental heritage ===

==== Parks and gardens ====

Pau is also a green city, having more than occupied by green areas, with many rare and exotic species. Pau has been classed &quot;4 flowers&quot; by the Competition of Flowery Cities and Villages. In some districts, for example Trespoey, the villas are bathed in vegetation. Pau is thus one of the European cities that have the most square meters of greenery per capita ( per capita):

*&quot;Parc Beaumont&quot; with a lake, river and waterfall, many flower beds, a large rockery and a rose garden. The rugby ball-shaped park contains 110 species of trees. Some subjects are &quot;notable&quot; by their size, their age or their rarity such as Bald Cypress from Louisiana, Virginia persimmon and giant sequoia.
*, a park with old trees, which is home to one of the many 19th century English villas of Pau.
*The National Domain of the Château de Pau, composed of a Renaissance garden with medicinal plants and a park. The large park has walking trails and plenty of open space, for outdoor activities in the middle of the city.
*The &quot;Sentiers du Roy&quot;, connecting the upper town to the lower town
*Johanto Gardens, at the bottom of the &quot;Boulevard des Pyrénées&quot;, with its many and strong Palm trees
*Contemporary gardens of the Hôtel du Département, in the lower town
*The banks of the Gave de Pau, at Billère and Jurançon, downstream from the Pont d&#x27;Espagne [bridge of Spain] and the Whitewater Arena.
*Besson Square, near the Conservatoire of music and dance with including &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;
*The Kōfu Garden, a Japanese garden opened in 2005 with plans provided by the gardeners of the city of Kōfu
*&quot;Parc en ciel&quot; [Park in the sky], opened in 2013 in the Hameau Quarter

==== Horizons Palois (Pau Horizons) ====
The notion of &quot;Horizons Palois&quot; refers to the desire to protect the major elements which structure the special view from Pau to its natural environment. The view from the heights of Pau includes the saligues of the Gave de Pau and the hillsides of Jurançon and finally the chain of the Pyrenees. Seventeen sites were registered in 1944 as &quot;Horizons Palois&quot;, in order to protect them from any construction or alteration that may deteriorate the extraordinary panorama which is particularly visible from the Boulevard des Pyrénées and the château. The city of Pau has committed several years of reflection to a candidacy of the Horizons to UNESCO World Heritage. This would thus enhance the protection of the panorama, and also be an improvement with the renaming of this site to the general public.

<text>Heinz von Foerster (; November 13, 1911 – October 2, 2002) was an Austrian-American scientist combining physics and philosophy, and widely attributed as the originator of second-order cybernetics. He was twice a Guggenheim fellow (1956–57 and 1963–64) and also was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1980. He is well known for his 1960 Doomsday equation formula published in &quot;Science&quot; predicting future population growth.

As a polymath, he wrote nearly two hundred professional papers, gaining renown in fields ranging from computer science and artificial intelligence to epistemology, and researched high-speed electronics and electro-optics switching devices as a physicist, and in biophysics, the study of memory and knowledge. He worked on cognition based on neurophysiology, mathematics, and philosophy and was called &quot;one of the most consequential thinkers in the history of cybernetics&quot;. He came to the United States, and stayed after meeting with Warren Sturgis McCulloch, where he received funding from The Pentagon to establish the Biological Computer Laboratory, which built the first parallel computer, the &quot;Numa-Rete&quot;. Working with William Ross Ashby, one of the original Ratio Club members, and together with Warren McCulloch, Norbert Wiener, John von Neumann and Lawrence J. Fogel, Heinz von Foerster was an architect of cybernetics and one of the members of the Macy conferences, eventually becoming editor of its early proceedings alongside Hans-Lukas Teuber and Margaret Mead.

==Biography==
Von Foerster was born in 1911 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, as Heinz von Förster. His paternal grandfather was the Austrian architect . His maternal grandmother was Marie Lang, an Austrian feminist, theosophist, and publisher. He studied physics at the Technical University of Vienna and at the University of Breslau, where in 1944 he received a PhD in physics. His relatives included Ludwig Wittgenstein, Erwin Lang and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Ludwig Förster was his great-grandfather. His Jewish roots did not cause him much trouble while he worked in radar laboratories during the Nazi era, as &quot;he hid his ancestry with the help of an employer who chose not to press him for documents on his family.&quot;

He moved to the US in 1949 and worked at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he was a professor of electrical engineering from 1951 to 1975. He was also professor of biophysics (1962–1975) and director of the Biological Computer Laboratory (1958–1975). Additionally, in 1956–57 and 1963–64, he was a Guggenheim Fellow and also President of the Wenner-Gren-Foundation for anthropological research from 1963 to 1965.

He knew well and was in conversation with John von Neumann, Norbert Wiener, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, Gordon Pask, Gregory Bateson, Lawrence J. Fogel and Margaret Mead, among many others. He influenced generations of students as a teacher and an inclusive, enthusiastic collaborator.

He died on October 2, 2002, in Pescadero, California.

==Work==
Von Foerster was influenced by the Vienna Circle and Ludwig Wittgenstein. He worked in the field of cybernetics and is known as the inventor of second-order cybernetics. He made important contributions to constructivism. He is also known for his interest in computer music and magic.

===The electron tube laboratory===
In 1949, von Foerster started work at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign at the electron tube laboratory of the Electrical Engineering Department, where he succeeded Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner. With his students he developed many innovative devices, including ultra-high-frequency electronics

He also worked on mathematical models of population dynamics and in 1959 published a model now called the &quot;von Foerster equation&quot;, which is derivable from the principles of constant aging and conservation of mass.

:formula_1

where: &quot;n&quot; = &quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;a&quot;), &quot;t&quot; stands for time and &quot;a&quot; for age. &quot;m&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is the death in function of the population age; &quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;a&quot;) is the population density in function of age.

When &quot;m&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = 0, we have:

:formula_2

It relates that a population ages, and that fact is the only one that influences change in population density.

It is therefore a continuity equation; it can be solved using the method of characteristics. Another way is by similarity solution; and a third is a numerical approach such as finite differences.

The gross birth rate is given by the following boundary condition:

:formula_3

The solution is only unique given the initial conditions

:formula_4

which states that the initial population distribution must be given; then it will evolve according to the partial differential equation.

===Biological Computer Laboratory===
In 1958, he formed the &quot;Biological Computer Lab&quot;, studying similarities in cybernetic systems in biology and electronics.

===Macy conferences===
He was the youngest member of the core group of the Macy conferences on Cybernetics and editor of the five volumes of &quot;Cybernetics&quot; (1949–1953), a series of conference transcripts that represent important foundational conversations in the field. It was von Foerster who suggested that Wiener&#x27;s coinage &quot;Cybernetics&quot; be applied to this conference series, which had previously been called &quot;Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems&quot;.

===Doomsday equation===
A 1960 issue of &quot;Science&quot; magazine included an article by von Foerster and his colleagues P. M. Mora and L. W. Amiot proposing a formula representing a best fit to available historical data on world population; the authors then predicted future population growth on the basis of this formula.
The formula gave 2.7 billion as the 1960 world population and predicted that population growth would become infinite by Friday, November 13, 2026 – von Foerster&#x27;s 115th birthday anniversary – a prediction that earned it the name &quot;the Doomsday Equation.&quot;

Based on population data obtained from various sources, von Foerster and his students concluded that world population growth over the centuries was faster than an exponential. In such a situation, doubling-time decreases over time. Von Foerster&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek prediction of Doomsday on November 13, 2026, was based on an extrapolation into the future of doubling-time, with the finding that doubling-time would decrease to zero on that date.

Responders to his Doomsday prediction objected on the grounds of the finite human gestation time of 9 months, and the transparent fact that biological systems rarely persist in exponential growth for any substantial length of time. Those who knew von Foerster could see in his rejoinders an evident sense of humor.

<text>Karlsruhe (, ; , ; ; South Franconian: &quot;Kallsruh&quot;) is the third-largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg, after its capital Stuttgart and Mannheim, and the 22nd-largest city in the nation, with 308,436 inhabitants. It is also a former capital of Baden, a historic region named after Hohenbaden Castle in the city of Baden-Baden. Located on the right bank of the Rhine (Upper Rhine) near the French border, between the Mannheim-Ludwigshafen conurbation to the north and Strasbourg to the south, Karlsruhe is Germany&#x27;s legal center, being home to the Federal Constitutional Court, the Federal Court of Justice and the Public Prosecutor General.

Karlsruhe was the capital of the Margraviate of Baden-Durlach (Durlach: 1565–1718; Karlsruhe: 1718–1771), the Margraviate of Baden (1771–1803), the Electorate of Baden (1803–1806), the Grand Duchy of Baden (1806–1918), and the Republic of Baden (1918–1945). Its most remarkable building is Karlsruhe Palace, which was built in 1715. It contains the Baden State Museum, the large cultural, art and regional history museum of the Baden region of Baden-Württemberg. There are nine institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport is the second-busiest airport in Baden-Württemberg after Stuttgart Airport, and the 17th-busiest airport in Germany.

==Geography==

Karlsruhe lies completely to the east of the Rhine, and almost completely on the Upper Rhine Plain. It contains the Turmberg in the east, and also lies on the borders of the Kraichgau leading to the Northern Black Forest.

The Rhine, one of the world&#x27;s most important shipping routes, forms the western limits of the city, beyond which lie the towns of Maximiliansau and Wörth am Rhein in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The city centre is about from the river, as measured from the Marktplatz (Market Square). Two tributaries of the Rhine, the Alb and the Pfinz, flow through the city from the Kraichgau to eventually join the Rhine.

The city lies at an altitude of between , the higher figure being near the communications tower in the suburb of Grünwettersbach. Its geographical coordinates are ; the 49th parallel runs through the city centre, which puts it at the same latitude as much of the Canada–United States border and the cities of Vancouver (Canada), Paris (France), Regensburg (Germany), and Hulunbuir (China). Its course is marked by a stone and painted line in the &quot;Stadtgarten&quot; (municipal park). The total area of the city is , hence it is the 30th largest city in Germany measured by land area. The longest north–south distance is and in the east–west direction.

Karlsruhe is part of the urban area of Karlsruhe/Pforzheim, to which certain other towns in the district of Karlsruhe, such as Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Stutensee, and Rheinstetten, as well as the city of Pforzheim, belong.

The city was planned with the palace tower (&quot;Schloss&quot;) at the center and 32 streets radiating out from it like the spokes of a wheel, or the ribs of a folding fan, so that one nickname for Karlsruhe in German is the &quot;fan city&quot; (&quot;Fächerstadt&quot;). Almost all of these streets survive to this day. Because of this city layout, in metric geometry, Karlsruhe metric refers to a measure of distance that assumes travel is only possible along radial streets and along circular avenues around the centre.

The city centre is the oldest part of town and lies south of the palace in the quadrant defined by nine of the radial streets. The central part of the palace runs east–west, with two wings, each at a 45° angle, directed southeast and southwest (i.e., parallel with the streets marking the boundaries of the quadrant defining the city center).

The market square lies on the street running south from the palace to Ettlingen. The market square has the town hall (&quot;Rathaus&quot;) to the west, the main Lutheran church (&quot;Evangelische Stadtkirche&quot;) to the east, and the tomb of Margrave Charles III William in a pyramid in the buildings, resulting in Karlsruhe being one of only three large cities in Germany where buildings are laid out in the neoclassical style.

The area north of the palace is a park and forest. Originally the area to the east of the palace consisted of gardens and forests, some of which remain, but the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (founded in 1825), Wildparkstadion football stadium, and residential areas have been built there. The area west of the palace is now mostly residential.

===Climate===
Karlsruhe experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) and its winter climate is milder, compared to most other German cities, except for the Rhine-Ruhr area. Summers are hot with several days registering maximum temperatures between . With an average of more than 2,000 sunshine hours a year, it is also one of the sunniest cities in Germany, like the Rhine-Palatinate area.

Precipitation occurs mainly during the winter, while in summer it is concentrated on single evening thunderstorms. In 2008, the weather station in Karlsruhe, which had been in operation since 1876, was closed; it was replaced by a weather station in Rheinstetten, south of Karlsruhe.

== Districts ==
{{Main|Boroughs of Karlsruhe}}

Karlsruhe is divided into 27 districts.

==History==
According to legend, the name &quot;Karlsruhe&quot;, which translates as &quot;Charles&#x27; repose&quot; or &quot;Charles&#x27; peace&quot;, was given to the new city after a hunting trip when Margrave Charles III William of Baden-Durlach woke from a dream in which he dreamt of founding his new city. A variation of this story claims that he built the new palace to find peace from his wife.

Charles William founded the city on June 17, 1715, after a dispute with the citizens of his previous capital, Durlach. The founding of the city is closely linked to the construction of the palace. Karlsruhe became the capital of Baden-Durlach, and, in 1771, of the united Baden until 1945. Built in 1822, the &quot;Ständehaus&quot; was the first parliament building in a German state. In the aftermath of the democratic revolution of 1848, a republican government was elected there.

Karlsruhe was visited by Thomas Jefferson during his time as the American envoy to France; when Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant was planning the layout of Washington, D.C., Jefferson passed to him maps of 12 European towns to consult, one of which was a sketch he had made of Karlsruhe during his visit.

In 1860, the first-ever international professional convention of chemists, the Karlsruhe Congress, was held in the city.

In 1907 the town was site of the Hau Riot where large crowds caused disturbance during the trial of murderer Carl Hau.

On Kristallnacht in 1938, the Adass Jeshurun synagogue was burned to the ground, and the city&#x27;s Jews were later sent to the Dachau concentration camp, Gurs concentration camp, Theresienstadt, and Auschwitz during the Holocaust, with 1,421 of Karlsruhe&#x27;s Jews being killed. During World War II, it was the location of a forced labour camp for men, and a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp, whose prisoners were mainly Poles and Russians.

{{anchor|Allied air attacks}}Much of the central area, including the palace, was reduced to rubble by Allied bombing during World War II, but was rebuilt after the war. Located in the American zone of the postwar Allied occupation, Karlsruhe was home to an American military base, established in 1945. After the war, the city was part of West Germany until 1990. In 1995, the bases closed, and their facilities were turned over to the city of Karlsruhe.

Karlsruhe has a population of about 310,000 and is the 3rd largest city in Baden-Württemberg. Karlsruhe, which was founded by Charles III William, became a major city in the 19th century. In the 1950s, Karlsruhe became a significant city where the population started to grow. It gained a large student population due to the university of technology and media arts. Karlsruhe reached populations of 200,000 in 1950 and 300,000 in 2014.


==Main sights==
The &quot;Stadtgarten&quot; is a recreational area near the main railway station (&quot;Hauptbahnhof&quot;) and was rebuilt for the 1967 Federal Garden Show (&quot;Bundesgartenschau&quot;). It is also the site of the Karlsruhe Zoo.

The &quot;Durlacher Turmberg&quot; has a lookout tower (hence its name). It is a former keep dating back to the 13th century.

The city has two botanical gardens: the municipal &quot;Botanischer Garten Karlsruhe&quot;, which forms part of the Palace complex, and the &quot;Botanischer Garten der Universität Karlsruhe&quot;, which is maintained by the university.

The &quot;Marktplatz&quot; has a stone pyramid marking the grave of the city&#x27;s founder. Built in 1825, it is the emblem of Karlsruhe.
The city is nicknamed the &quot;fan city&quot; (&quot;die Fächerstadt&quot;) because of its design layout, with straight streets radiating fan-like from the Palace.

The Karlsruhe Palace (&quot;Schloss&quot;) is an interesting piece of architecture; the adjacent &quot;Schlossgarten&quot; includes the Botanical Garden with a palm, cactus and orchid house, and walking paths through the woods to the north.

The so-called &quot;Kleine Kirche&quot; (Little Church), built between 1773 and 1776, is the oldest church of Karlsruhe&#x27;s city centre.

The architect Friedrich Weinbrenner designed many of the city&#x27;s most important sights. Another sight is the &quot;Rondellplatz&quot; with its &#x27;Constitution Building Columns&#x27; (1826). It is dedicated to Baden&#x27;s first constitution in 1818, which was one of the most liberal of its time. The &quot;Münze&quot; (mint), erected in 1826/27, was also built by Weinbrenner.

The St. Stephan parish church is one of the masterpieces of neoclassical church architecture in. Weinbrenner, who built this church between 1808 and 1814, orientated it to the Pantheon, Rome.

The neo-Gothic Grand Ducal Burial Chapel, built between 1889 and 1896, is a mausoleum rather than a church, and is located in the middle of the forest.

The main of Karlsruhe is the oldest park-like cemetery in Germany. The crematorium was the first to be built in the style of a church.

Karlsruhe is also home to a natural history museum (the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe), an opera house (the Baden State Theatre), as well as a number of independent theatres and art galleries. The State Art Gallery, built in 1846 by Heinrich Hübsch, displays paintings and sculptures from six centuries, particularly from France, Germany and Holland. Karlsruhe&#x27;s newly renovated art museum is one of the most important art museums in Baden-Württemberg. Further cultural attractions are scattered throughout Karlsruhe&#x27;s various incorporated suburbs. Established in 1924, the Scheffel Association is the largest literary society in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Today the &quot;Prinz-Max-Palais&quot;, built between 1881 and 1884 in neoclassical style, houses the organisation and includes its museum.

Due to population growth in the late 19th century, Karlsruhe developed several suburban areas (&quot;Vorstadt&quot;) in the {{Lang|de|Gründerzeit}} and especially Art Nouveau styles of architecture, with many preserved examples.

Karlsruhe is also home to the &quot;Majolika-Manufaktur&quot;, the only art-ceramics pottery studio in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Founded in 1901, it is located in the &quot;Schlossgarten&quot;. A &#x27;blue streak&#x27; (&quot;Blauer Strahl&quot;) consisting of 1,645 ceramic tiles, connects the studio with the Palace. It is the world&#x27;s largest ceramic artwork.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Another tourist attraction is the Centre for Art and Media (&quot;Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie&quot;, or ZKM), which is located in a converted ammunition factory.

==Government==

===Justice===

Karlsruhe is the seat of the German Federal Constitutional Court &quot;(Bundesverfassungsgericht)&quot; and the highest Court of Appeals in civil and criminal cases, the &quot;Bundesgerichtshof&quot;. The courts came to Karlsruhe after World War II, when the provinces of Baden and Württemberg were merged. Stuttgart, capital of Württemberg, became the capital of the new province (Württemberg-Baden in 1945 and Baden-Württemberg in 1952). In compensation for the state authorities relocated to Stuttgart, Karlsruhe applied to become the seat of the high court.

===Public health===
There are four hospitals: The &quot;Karlsruhe Municipal Hospital&quot; provides the maximum level of medical services, the &quot;St. Vincentius-Kliniken&quot; and the &quot;Diakonissenkrankenhaus&quot;, connected to the Catholic and Protestant churches, respectively, offer central services, and the private &quot;Paracelsus-Klinik&quot; basic medical care, according to state hospital demand planning.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Economy==
Germany&#x27;s largest oil refinery is located in Karlsruhe, at the western edge of the city, directly on the river Rhine. The &quot;Technologieregion Karlsruhe&quot; is a loose confederation of the region&#x27;s cities in order to promote high tech industries; today, about 20% of the region&#x27;s jobs are in research and development. EnBW, one of Germany&#x27;s biggest electric utility companies, with a revenue of €19.2 billion in 2012, is headquartered in the city.

===Internet activities===
Due to the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology providing services until the late 1990, Karlsruhe became known as the &quot;internet capital&quot; of Germany. The DENIC, Germany&#x27;s network information centre, has since moved to Frankfurt, though, where DE-CIX is located.

Two major internet service providers, WEB.DE and schlund+partner/1&amp;1, now both owned by United Internet AG, are located at Karlsruhe.

The library of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology developed the Karlsruher Virtueller Katalog, the first internet site that allowed researchers worldwide (for free) to search multiple library catalogues worldwide.

In 2000, the regional online newspaper &quot;ka-news.de&quot; was created. As a daily newspaper, it not only provides the news, but also informs readers about upcoming events in Karlsruhe and surrounding areas.
In addition to established companies, Karlsruhe has a vivid and spreading startup community with well-known startups. Together, the local high tech industry is responsible for over 22,000 jobs.

==Transport==

=== Railway ===
The Verkehrsbetriebe Karlsruhe (VBK) operates the city&#x27;s urban public transport network, comprising seven tram routes and a network of bus routes. All city areas can be reached round the clock by tram and a night bus system. The Turmbergbahn funicular railway, to the east of the city centre, is also operated by the VBK. Similar to a premetro tramlines operating in the city centre use two tramway tunnels that were completed on 11 December 2021.

The VBK is also a partner, with the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft and Deutsche Bahn, in the operation of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, the rail system that serves a larger area around the city. This system makes it possible to reach other towns in the region, like Ettlingen, Wörth am Rhein, Pforzheim, Bad Wildbad, Bretten, Bruchsal, Heilbronn, Baden-Baden, and even Freudenstadt in the Black Forest right from the city centre. The Stadtbahn is known for pioneering the concept of operating trams on train tracks, to achieve a more effective and attractive public transport system.

Karlsruhe is connected via road and rail, with Autobahn and Intercity Express connections going to Frankfurt, Stuttgart/Munich and Freiburg/Basel from Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof. Since June 2007 it has been connected to the TGV network, reducing travel time to Paris to three hours (previously it had taken five hours).

The Rhine Valley Railway is also an important freight line. Freight trains can bypass Karlsuhe Hauptbahnhof via the Karlsruhe freight bypass railway.

=== Shipping ===

Two ports on the Rhine provide transport capacity on cargo ships, especially for petroleum products.

=== Airport ===
The nearest airport is part of the Baden Airpark (officially &quot;Flughafen Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden&quot;) about {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Karlsruhe, with regular connections to airports in Germany and Europe in general. Frankfurt International Airport can be reached in about an hour and a half by car (one hour by Intercity Express); Stuttgart Airport can be reached in about one hour (about an hour and a half by train and S-Bahn).

=== Streets ===
Karlsruhe is at the Bundesautobahn 5 and the Bundesstraße 10. In the city there is a good bike lane infrastructure.

Two interesting facts in transportation history are that both Karl Drais, the inventor of the bicycle, as well as Karl Benz, the inventor of the automobile were born in Karlsruhe. Benz was born in Mühlburg, which later became a borough of Karlsruhe (in 1886). Benz also studied at the Karlsruhe University. Benz&#x27;s wife Bertha took the world&#x27;s first long distance-drive with an automobile from Mannheim to Karlsruhe-Grötzingen and Pforzheim (see Bertha Benz Memorial Route). Their professional lives led both men to the neighboring city of Mannheim, where they first applied their most famous inventions.
==Jewish community==
Jews settled in Karlsruhe soon after its founding. They were attracted by the numerous privileges granted by its founder to settlers, without discrimination as to creed. Official documents attest the presence of several Jewish families at Karlsruhe in 1717. A year later the city council addressed to the margrave a report in which a question was raised as to the proportion of municipal charges to be borne by the newly arrived Jews, who in that year formed an organized congregation, with Rabbi Nathan Uri Kohen of Metz at its head. A document dated 1726 gives the names of twenty-four Jews who had taken part in an election of municipal officers.

As the city grew, permission to settle there became less easily obtained by Jews, and the community developed more slowly. A 1752 Jewry ordinance stated Jews were forbidden to leave the city on Sundays and Christian holidays, or to go out of their houses during church services, but they were exempted from service by court summonses on Sabbaths. They could sell wine only in inns owned by Jews and graze their cattle, not on the commons, but on the wayside only. Nethanael Weill was a rabbi in Karlsruhe from 1750 until his death.

In 1783, by a decree issued by Margrave Charles Frederick of Baden, the Jews ceased to be serfs, and consequently could settle wherever they pleased. The same decree freed them from the &quot;Todfall&quot; tax, paid to the clergy for each Jewish burial. In commemoration of these changes special prayers were prepared by the acting rabbi Jedidiah Tiah Weill, who, succeeding his father in 1770, held the office until 1805.

In 1808 the new constitution of what at that time, during the Napoleonic era, had become the Grand Duchy of Baden granted Jews citizenship status; a subsequent edict, in 1809, constitutionally acknowledged Jews as a religious group. The latter edict provided for a hierarchical organization of the Jewish communities of Baden, under the umbrella of a central council of Baden Jewry (Oberrat der Israeliten Badens), with its seat in Karlsruhe, and the appointment of a chief rabbi of Karlsruhe, as the spiritual head of the Jews in all of Baden. The first chief rabbi of Karlsruhe and Baden was Rabbi Asher Loew, who served from 1809 until his death in 1837.

Complete emancipation was given in 1862, Jews were elected to city council and Baden parliament, and from 1890 were appointed judges. Jews were persecuted in the &#x27;Hep-Hep&#x27; riots that occurred in 1819; and anti-Jewish demonstrations were held in 1843, 1848, and the 1880s. The well-known German-Israeli artist Leo Kahn studied in Karlsruhe before leaving for France and Israel in the 1920s and 1930s.

Today, there are about 900 members in the Jewish community, many of whom are recent immigrants from Russia, and an orthodox rabbi.

Karlsruhe has memorialized its Jewish community and notable pre-war synagogues with a memorial park.

=== Karlsruhe and the Shoah ===
On 28 October 1938, all Jewish men of Polish extraction were expelled to the Polish border, their families joining them later and most ultimately perishing in the ghettoes and concentration camps. On Kristallnacht (9–10 November 1938), the Adass Jeshurun synagogue was burned to the ground, the main synagogue was damaged, and Jewish men were taken to the Dachau concentration camp after being beaten and tormented. Deportations commenced on 22 October 1940, when 893 Jews were loaded onto trains for the three-day journey to the Gurs concentration camp in France. Another 387 were deported in from 1942 to 1945 to lzbica in the Lublin district (Poland), Theresienstadt, and Auschwitz. Of the 1,280 Jews deported directly from Karlsruhe, 1,175 perished. Another 138 perished after deportation from other German cities or occupied Europe. In all, 1,421 of Karlsruhe&#x27;s Jews died during the Shoah. A new community was formed after the war by surviving former residents, with a new synagogue erected in 1971. It numbered 359 in 1980.

<doc id="105038" wikidata="Q453209" url="?curid=105038" title="Charles Whitman">
<text>Charles Joseph Whitman (June 24, 1941 – August 1, 1966) was an American mass murderer and Marine veteran who became known as the &quot;Texas Tower Sniper&quot;. On August 1, 1966, Whitman used knives to kill his mother and his wife in their respective homes, then went to the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) with multiple firearms and began indiscriminately shooting at people. He fatally shot three people inside UT Austin&#x27;s Main Building, then accessed the 28th-floor observation deck on the building&#x27;s clock tower. There, he fired at random people for 96 minutes, killing an additional eleven people and wounding 31 others before he was shot dead by the Austin Police Department. Whitman killed a total of seventeen people; the 17th victim died 35 years later from injuries sustained in the attack.

==Early life and education==
Charles Whitman was born on June 24, 1941, in Lake Worth, Florida, the eldest of three sons born to Margaret E. ( Hodges) and Charles Adolphus Whitman Jr. Whitman&#x27;s father was raised in an orphanage in Savannah, Georgia, and described himself as a self-made man. His wife, Margaret, was 17 years old at the time they met. The marriage of Whitman&#x27;s parents was marred by domestic violence; Whitman&#x27;s father was an admitted authoritarian who provided for his family but demanded near perfection from all of them. He was known to be physically and emotionally abusive towards his wife and children.

As a boy, Whitman was described as a polite child who seldom lost his temper. He was extremely intelligent—an examination at the age of six revealed his IQ to be 139. Whitman&#x27;s academic achievements were encouraged by his parents, and any indication of failure or a lethargic attitude were met with discipline—often physical—from his father.

Margaret was a devout Roman Catholic who raised her sons in the same denomination. The Whitman brothers regularly attended Mass with their mother, and all three brothers served as altar boys at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church in Lake Worth.

Whitman&#x27;s father was a firearms collector and enthusiast, who taught each of his young sons to shoot, clean, and maintain weapons. He regularly took them on hunting trips, and Charles became an avid hunter and accomplished marksman. His father said of him: &quot;Charlie could plug the eye out of a squirrel by the time he was sixteen.&quot;

Whitman joined the Boy Scouts of America at age 11. He became an Eagle Scout at twelve years three months, reportedly the youngest of any Eagle Scout up to that time. Whitman also became an accomplished pianist at the age of 12. At around the same time, he began an extensive newspaper route.

===High school===

In September 1955, Whitman entered St. Ann&#x27;s High School in West Palm Beach, where he was regarded as a moderately popular student. By the next month, he had saved enough money from his newspaper route to purchase a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which he used on his route.

Without telling his father beforehand, Whitman enlisted in the United States Marine Corps one month after his June 1959 graduation from high school, where he had graduated seventh in a class of 72 students. Whitman told a family friend that the catalyst for his enlistment was an incident a month earlier, in which his father had beaten him and thrown him into the family swimming pool because Whitman had come home drunk. Whitman left home on July 6, having been assigned an eighteen-month tour of duty with the Marines at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. As Whitman traveled toward Parris Island, his father, who still had not known of Whitman&#x27;s enlistment, learned of his action and telephoned a branch of the federal government trying to have his son&#x27;s enlistment canceled.

===U.S. Marine and college student===
During Whitman&#x27;s initial eighteen-month service in 1959 and 1960, he earned a sharpshooter&#x27;s badge and the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal. He achieved 215 of 250 possible points on marksmanship tests, doing well when shooting rapidly over long distances as well as at moving targets. After completing his assignment, Whitman applied for a scholarship to the Naval Enlisted Science and Education Program (NESEP), an initiative designed to send enlisted personnel to college to train as engineers, and after graduation, be commissioned as officers. Whitman earned high scores on the required examination, and the selection committee approved his enrollment at a preparatory school in Maryland, where he completed courses in mathematics and physics before being approved to transfer to the University of Texas at Austin to study mechanical engineering.

==University life==
In September 1961, Whitman entered the mechanical engineering program at UT Austin. He was initially a poor student. His hobbies included karate, scuba diving, gambling, and hunting. Shortly after his enrollment, Whitman and two friends were observed poaching a deer, with a passerby recording his license plate number and reporting them to the police. The trio were butchering the deer in the shower at Whitman&#x27;s dormitory when they were arrested. Whitman was fined $100 ($ in ) for the offense.

Whitman earned a reputation as a practical joker in his years as an engineering student, but his friends also noted he made some morbid and chilling statements. In 1962, he remarked to a fellow student, &quot;A person could stand off an army from atop of [the Main Building&#x27;s clock tower] before they got him.&quot;

===Marriage===

In February 1962, 20-year-old Whitman met Kathleen Frances Leissner, an education major three years his junior. Leissner was Whitman&#x27;s first serious girlfriend; he briefly dated actress Deanna Dunagan just prior to beginning his relationship with Leissner. They courted for five months before announcing their engagement on July 19.

On August 17, 1962, Whitman and Leissner were married in a Catholic ceremony held in Leissner&#x27;s hometown of Needville, Texas. The couple chose the 22nd wedding anniversary of Whitman&#x27;s parents as the date for their wedding. Whitman&#x27;s family drove from Florida to attend the event, and his younger brother Patrick served as best man. Father Leduc, a Whitman family friend, presided over the ceremony. Leissner&#x27;s family and friends approved of her choice of husband, describing Whitman as a &quot;handsome young man&quot; who was both intelligent and aspirational.

Although Whitman&#x27;s grades improved somewhat during his second and third semesters, the Marines considered them insufficient for continuation of his scholarship. He was ordered to active duty in February 1963 and went to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, for the remainder of his five-year enlistment.

===Camp Lejeune===
Whitman apparently resented his college studies being ended, although he was automatically promoted to the rank of Lance Corporal. At Camp Lejeune, he was hospitalized for four days after single-handedly freeing another Marine by lifting a Jeep which had rolled over an embankment.

Despite his reputation as an exemplary Marine, Whitman continued to gamble. In November 1963, he was court-martialed for gambling, usury, possession of a personal firearm on base, and threatening another Marine over a $30 loan ($ in ) for which he had demanded $15 in interest. Sentenced to thirty days of confinement and ninety days of hard labor, he was demoted from lance corporal (E-3) to private (E-1).

==Documented stressors==

While awaiting his court-martial in 1963, Whitman began to write a diary titled &quot;Daily Record of C. J. Whitman&quot;. In it, he wrote about his daily life in the Marine Corps and his interactions with his wife and other family members. He also wrote about his upcoming court-martial and contempt for the Marine Corps, criticizing them for inefficiencies. In his writings about Leissner, Whitman often praised her and expressed his longing to be with her. He also wrote about his efforts and plans to free himself from financial dependence on his father.

In December 1964, Whitman was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps. He returned to UT Austin, enrolling in the architectural engineering program. To support his wife and himself, he worked as a bill collector for the Standard Finance Company. Later, he worked as a bank teller at the Austin National Bank. In January 1965, Whitman took a temporary job with Central Freight Lines as a traffic surveyor for the Texas Highway Department, while his wife worked as a biology teacher at Lanier High School. He was also a volunteer scout leader with Austin Scout Troop 5.

Friends later said that Whitman had told them that he struck his wife on three occasions. They said that Whitman despised himself for this and confessed to being &quot;mortally afraid of being like his father.&quot; In his journal, Whitman lamented his actions and resolved to be a good husband and not abusive as his father had been.

===Separation of Whitman&#x27;s parents===
In May 1966, Whitman&#x27;s mother announced her decision to divorce her husband because of his continued physical abuse. Whitman drove to Florida to help his mother move to Austin. He was reportedly so afraid that his father would resort to violence against his mother as she prepared to leave that he summoned a local policeman to remain outside the house while she packed her belongings. Whitman&#x27;s youngest brother, John, also left Lake Worth and moved to Austin with his mother. Patrick Whitman, the middle son, remained in Florida and worked in his father&#x27;s plumbing supply business.

In Austin, Whitman&#x27;s mother took a job in a cafeteria and moved into her own apartment, though she remained in close contact with him. Whitman&#x27;s father later said he had spent more than $1,000 ($ in ) on long-distance phone calls to both his wife and his son, begging his wife to return and asking his son to convince her to come back. During this stressful time, Whitman was abusing amphetamines and began experiencing severe headaches, which he described as being &quot;tremendous&quot;.

== Events leading to the shooting ==

On the day before the shootings, Whitman bought a pair of binoculars and a knife from a hardware store, and some Spam from a 7-Eleven convenience store. He picked up his wife from her summer job as a telephone operator before he met his mother for lunch at the Wyatt Cafeteria, which was close to the UT Austin campus.

At about 4:00 p.m. the same day, Whitman and his wife visited their close friends John and Frances Morgan. They left the Morgans&#x27; apartment at 5:50 p.m. so Kathy could get to her 6:00–10:00 p.m. shift.

At 6:45 p.m., Whitman began typing his suicide note, a portion of which read:
In his note, Whitman went on to request an autopsy be performed on his remains after he was dead to determine if there had been a biological cause for his actions and for his continuing and increasingly intense headaches. He also wrote that he had decided to kill both his mother and wife. Expressing uncertainty about his reasons, he nonetheless stated he did not believe his mother had &quot;ever enjoyed life as she is entitled to&quot;, and that his wife had &quot;been as fine a wife to me as any man could ever hope to have&quot;. Whitman further explained that he wanted to relieve both his wife and mother of the suffering of this world, and to save them the embarrassment of his actions. He did not mention planning the attack at the university.

Just after midnight on August 1, Whitman drove to his mother&#x27;s apartment at 1212 Guadalupe Street. After killing his mother, he placed her body on her bed and covered it with sheets. How he murdered his mother is disputed, but officials believed he rendered her unconscious before stabbing her in the heart.

He left a handwritten note beside her body, which read in part:

Whitman then returned to his home at 906 Jewell Street, where he killed his wife by stabbing her five times in the chest as she slept. He covered her body with sheets, then resumed the typewritten note he had begun the previous evening. Using a ballpoint pen, he wrote at the side of the page:
Whitman continued the note, finishing it by pen:
Whitman also left instructions in the rented house requesting that two rolls of camera film be developed and wrote personal notes to each of his brothers. He last wrote on an envelope labeled &quot;Thoughts for the Day&quot;, in which he stored a collection of written admonitions. He added on the outside of the envelope:
At 5:45 a.m. on August 1, 1966, Whitman phoned his wife&#x27;s supervisor at Bell System to explain that Kathy was ill and unable to work that day. He made a similar phone call to his mother&#x27;s workplace five hours later.

Whitman&#x27;s final journal entries were written in the past tense, suggesting that he had already killed his wife and mother.

==University of Texas Tower shooting==
At approximately 11:35 a.m., Whitman arrived on the UT Austin campus. He falsely identified himself as a research assistant and told a security guard he was there to deliver equipment. He then climbed to the 28th floor of the Main Building&#x27;s clock tower, killing three people within the tower, and opened fire from the observation deck with a hunting rifle and other weapons.

Whitman killed 15 people and wounded 31 in the 96 minutes before he was shot and killed. Patrolman Houston McCoy and Ramiro Martinez of the Austin Police Department had raced to the top of the tower and a combination of shots from both men killed Whitman.

==Death and inquest==

===Medical history===
Investigating officers found that Whitman had visited several UT Austin physicians in the year before the shootings; they prescribed various medications for him. Whitman had seen a minimum of five doctors between the fall and winter of 1965 before he visited a psychiatrist from whom he received no prescription. At some other time he was prescribed Valium by Jan Cochrum, who recommended he visit the campus psychiatrist.

Whitman met with Maurice Dean Heatly, the staff psychiatrist at the University of Texas Health Center, on March 29, 1966. He referred to his visit with Heatly in his final suicide note, writing: &quot;I talked with a Doctor once for about two hours and tried to convey to him my fears that I felt come overwhelming violent impulses. After one visit, I never saw the Doctor again, and since then have been fighting my mental turmoil alone, and seemingly to no avail.&quot;

Heatly&#x27;s notes on the visit said, &quot;This massive, muscular youth seemed to be oozing with hostility [...] that something seemed to be happening to him and that he didn&#x27;t seem to be himself.&quot; &quot;He readily admits having overwhelming periods of hostility with a very minimum of provocation. Repeated inquiries attempting to analyze his exact experiences were not too successful with the exception of his vivid reference to &#x27;thinking about going up on the tower with a deer rifle and start shooting people.

===Autopsy===
Although Whitman had been prescribed drugs and was in possession of Dexedrine at the time of his death, the toxicology examination was delayed because his corpse was embalmed on August 1, after it was delivered to the Cook Funeral Home in Austin; however, the autopsy that Whitman had requested in his suicide notes was authorized by his father.

On August 2, Dr. Coleman de Chenar, a neuropathologist at Austin State Hospital, realized the autopsy at the funeral home; Whitman&#x27;s urine and blood were tested for amphetamines and other drugs. During the autopsy, Dr. Chenar reported that he discovered a pecan-sized brain tumor, above the red nucleus, in the white matter below the gray center thalamus, which he identified as an astrocytoma with slight necrosis.

===Connally Commission===
John Connally, then governor of Texas, commissioned a task force to examine the autopsy findings and material related to Whitman&#x27;s actions and motives. The commission was composed of neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, pathologists, and psychologists, and included the University of Texas Health Center Directors, John White and Maurice Heatly. The commission&#x27;s toxicology tests revealed nothing significant. They examined Chenar&#x27;s paraffin blocks of the brain tumor, stained specimens of it and Whitman&#x27;s other brain tissue, in addition to the remainder of the autopsy specimens available.

Following a three-hour hearing on August 5, the commission concluded that Chenar&#x27;s diagnosis of astrocytoma with a small amount of necrosis had been in error. The panel instead found that the tumor had features of a glioblastoma multiforme, with widespread areas of necrosis, palisading of cells, and a &quot;remarkable vascular component&quot; described as having &quot;the nature of a small congenital vascular malformation&quot;. Psychiatric contributors to the report concluded that &quot;the relationship between the brain tumor and [...] Whitman&#x27;s actions [...] cannot be established with clarity. However, the [...] tumor conceivably could have contributed to his inability to control his emotions and actions&quot;. The neurologists and neuropathologists were more circumspect, concluding that, &quot;[t]he application of existing knowledge of organic brain function does not enable us to explain the actions of Whitman on August first.&quot;

Forensic investigators have theorized that the tumor pressed against Whitman&#x27;s amygdala, a part of the brain related to anxiety and fight-or-flight responses among numerous other functions.

==Funeral==
A joint Catholic funeral service for Whitman and his mother was held in Lake Worth, Florida, on August 5, 1966. They were buried in Florida&#x27;s Hillcrest Memorial Park. Since he was a military veteran, Whitman was buried with military honors; his casket was draped with the American flag.

<text>Rogernomics (a portmanteau of &quot;Roger&quot; and &quot;economics&quot; modelled on Reaganomics) were the neoliberal economic reforms promoted by Roger Douglas, the Minister of Finance between 1984 and 1988 in the Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand. Rogernomics featured market-led restructuring and deregulation and the control of inflation through tight monetary policy, accompanied by a floating exchange-rate and reductions in the fiscal deficit.

During the early 1980s, Douglas transitioned from a traditional Labour politician advocating for economic interventionism to a proponent of neoliberal economics. After the Labour Party won government in 1984, Douglas and his associates implemented major policies including a 20% devaluation of the dollar, corporatisation of state-owned business, removal of subsidies to industries (particularly agricultural subsidies), reduction of tariff protection, and a significant overhaul of the tax system. Tax cuts were implemented, and a Goods and Services Tax (initially set at 10%) was introduced.

Rogernomics represented a sharp departure from the post-war political consensus that emphasised heavy interventionism, protectionism, and full employment. Instead, it embraced principles of small government, balanced budgets, and free market policies influenced by the Chicago school of economics. Douglas&#x27; adoption of policies more usually associated with the political right (or New Right), and their implementation by the Fourth Labour Government, became the subject of lasting controversy. 
While proponents argued that Rogernomics brought about positive changes such as single-digit inflation and reduced tax rates, critics highlighted social challenges, including rising poverty and unemployment. The legacy of Rogernomics continues to shape discussions on economic policy in New Zealand.

==Etymology==
In February 1985, journalists at the &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot; coined the term &quot;Rogernomics&quot; as a portmanteau of &quot;Roger&quot; and &quot;economics&quot;. It echoes &quot;Reaganomics&quot;, similar neoliberal economic policies promoted by United States President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.

==Douglas and the development of economic policy, 1969–1983==
Douglas became a Labour member of Parliament at the 1969 general election. He showed his interest in economic policy in his maiden speech, in which he argued against foreign investment in the domestic economy. His case for external protection of the domestic economy and government involvement in investment was characteristic of the Labour Party of the time. From 1972 to 1975, Douglas was a junior minister in the Third Labour Government, where he won a reputation for his capacity for innovation. This government followed a broadly Keynesian approach to economic management.

As a minister, Douglas was innovative in the context of the public sector. As Broadcasting Minister he devised an administrative structure in which two publicly owned television channels competed against each other. He was among the government’s leading advocates of compulsory saving for retirement, which he saw not only as a supplement to public provision for retirement but as a source of funding for public investment in economic development. The superannuation scheme he helped design became law in 1974, but was disestablished by Robert Muldoon almost as soon as the National Party won the 1975 election.

Douglas maintained his interest in economic issues in opposition. He framed his chief concern as the deep-seated problems in the structure of the economy that had contributed to deteriorating economic performance, and a standard of living that was slipping in comparison to that of other developed countries. In 1980, he described New Zealand as a country living on borrowed money, unable – in spite of the record efforts of its exporters – to pay its own way in the world.

The post-war political consensus had produced stability but Douglas came to view this as being at the cost of innovation. Both major political parties maintained the high levels of protection introduced by the First Labour Government from 1936 onwards, and since 1945 both parties had aimed at maintaining full employment. However, beneficiaries of the regulated economy had flourished in both public and private sectors.

Douglas argued that only radical action would improve the economic outlook. In 1980, he published an &quot;Alternative Budget&quot; that attacked what Douglas called the Muldoon government&#x27;s &quot;tinkering&quot; with the economy. He wrote that twenty years of pandering to entrenched interests had dampened productive investment. The Labour leadership saw his proposals and their unauthorised publication as unfavourable comment on Labour policy. The Labour leader Bill Rowling publicly rebuked Douglas. Douglas then published his thinking in the form of a book. Alongside far-reaching proposals for reform of taxation and government spending, it advocated a twenty per cent devaluation of the dollar to increase the competitiveness of exports. Although radical, it took an eclectic approach and did not hint at the abandonment of Labour&#x27;s Keynesian policy framework.

Douglas became increasingly frustrated by what he saw as the Labour Party&#x27;s reluctance to deal with fundamental issues of economic policy. He claimed in 1981 that Labour had an image as a party that would promise the public anything to be elected. He argued that the party should agree on its economic policy before it agreed on anything else, and allow economic reality to play a part in its decision-making. Unable to convince Rowling of the merit of his case, a disillusioned Douglas decided to stand down from parliament at the 1981 election. One of those who persuaded him to stay was Labour’s deputy leader David Lange, who offered to make Douglas minister of finance if Lange was prime minister after the 1984 election.

===Events after the 1981 election===
After Labour&#x27;s narrow loss in the 1981 election, Douglas found a growing audience in the parliamentary party for his view that Labour&#x27;s established approach to economic policy was deficient. His colleague Mike Moore claimed that there was a public perception that Labour policy sought &quot;to reward the lazy and defend bludgers&quot;. Douglas&#x27;s case for a radical approach was strengthened by the belief among many of his parliamentary colleagues that the economy&#x27;s deep-seated problems could only be solved by extensive restructuring. It was understood that some restructuring must follow the Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia, which took effect in 1981 and reduced barriers to trade between Australia and New Zealand. At the same time, many economists were arguing for the greater use of competition as a tool of policy, and expressing concern about excessive or inappropriate regulation of the economy. In 1983, Lange succeeded Rowling as Labour leader. He gave Douglas responsibility for economic policy and made it clear that economic policy would determine other policy.

Although Douglas was innovative in his approach, and his open disregard for Rowling had earned him a reputation as a maverick, he remained within the mainstream of economic thinking in the parliamentary Labour Party. He argued in 1982 that the government should actively support small business, and intervene to stop the aggregation of assets by big business. In his view, the government should use the tax system to encourage productive investment and discourage speculative investment. Until the end of 1983, Douglas saw exchange rate, tax and protection policies as means of actively shaping the business environment. In August 1982 he supported a contributory superannuation scheme as a means of funding industrial development and in February 1983 he wrote a paper called &quot;Picking Winners for Investment&quot; which proposed the establishment of local consultative groups to guide regional development. In a paper dated May 1983, Douglas argued that an unregulated market led to unhealthy concentrations of market power.

==A new direction, 1983–1984==

At the end of 1983 there was a marked change in Douglas&#x27;s thinking. He prepared a caucus paper called the &quot;Economic Policy Package&quot; which called for a market-led restructuring of the economy. The key proposal was a 20 per cent devaluation of the dollar, to be followed by the removal of subsidies to industry, border protection and export incentives. The paper doubted the value of &quot;picking winners&quot; and saw only a limited place for government funding of economic development. His colleague Stan Rodger described the paper as a &quot;quite unacceptable leap to the right&quot;. It immediately polarised opinion in the Labour Party.

Douglas characterised the policy package as restrained and responsible, and an appropriate response to the country&#x27;s economic difficulties. He acknowledged the contribution to the package of Doug Andrew, a Treasury officer on secondment to the parliamentary opposition, among others. W H Oliver noted the close alignment of the package and &quot;Economic Management&quot;, Treasury&#x27;s 1984 briefing to the incoming government. His assessment was that Douglas was predisposed towards the Treasury view because its implementation required decisive action and because greater reliance on the market solved what Douglas saw as the problem of interest-group participation in policy-making.

Division in Labour over economic policy crystallised when a competing proposal was submitted to the Labour Party&#x27;s Policy Council. Its proponents included Rowling and others who had resisted his replacement as leader. It argued for a Keynesian use of monetary and fiscal policy. It was sceptical about the ability of the private sector to promote economic development. Economic restructuring was to be led by the government, which would act within a consultative framework. In this way, the social costs of restructuring would be avoided.

There was stalemate in the Policy Council. As the 1984 election drew closer, Labour&#x27;s deputy leader Geoffrey Palmer drafted a compromise that contained elements of both proposals. The Palmer paper was broadly worded, and it made no mention of devaluation. It anticipated some form of understanding between government and unions about wage restraint. It allowed for extensive consultation about economic policy and stated that necessary structural change would be gradual and agreed. When Muldoon unexpectedly called an early general election, the Labour Party adopted Palmer&#x27;s paper as its economic policy. Lange said that Labour went into the election with an unfinished argument doing duty as its economic policy.

==Minister of Finance, 1984–1988==
In 1984, Roger Douglas was made Minister of Finance, with two associate ministers of finance, David Caygill and Richard Prebble. They became known as the &quot;Treasury Troika&quot; or the &quot;Troika&quot;, and became the most powerful group in Cabinet. Douglas was the strategist, Prebble the tactician, while Caygill mastered the details. With Caygill the &quot;nice cop&quot; and Prebble the &quot;nasty cop&quot;, Douglas could sometimes appear as steering a considered middle course. Later Trevor de Cleene was made undersecretary to Douglas, with special responsibility for Inland Revenue.

The key element of Douglas&#x27;s economic thinking was implemented after Labour won the 1984 election but before it was formally sworn into office. This was the 20 per cent devaluation of the New Zealand dollar. The announcement of the snap election immediately provoked selling of the dollar by dealers who anticipated that a change of government would lead to a substantial devaluation. The result was a currency crisis that became a matter of public knowledge two days after the general election. Muldoon refused to accept official advice that devaluation was the only way to stop the currency crisis and provoked a brief constitutional crisis when he initially refused to implement the incoming government’s instruction that he devalue. Both crises were soon settled when accepted that he had no choice but to devalue after Muldoon&#x27;s National Party colleagues threatened to approach the Governor General to dismiss him. Although devaluation was a contentious issue in the Labour Party and was not part of Labour&#x27;s election policy, the decisiveness with which the incoming government acted won it popular acclaim and enhanced Douglas&#x27;s standing in the new cabinet.

The reformers argued that the speed with which the reforms were made was due to the fact that New Zealand had not adjusted to Britain&#x27;s abandonment of the empire, and had to move quickly to &quot;catch up&quot; with the rest of the world. Douglas claimed in his 1993 book &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; that speed was a key strategy for achieving radical economic change: &quot;Define your objectives clearly, and move towards them in quantum leaps, otherwise the interest groups will have time to mobilise and drag you down&quot;. Political commentator Bruce Jesson argued that Douglas acted fast to achieve a complete economic revolution within one parliamentary term, in case he did not get a second chance. The reforms can be summarised as the dismantling of the Australasian orthodoxy of state development that had existed for the previous 90 years, and its replacement by the Anglo-American neo-classical model based on the monetarist policies of Milton Friedman and the Chicago School. The financial market was deregulated and controls on foreign exchange removed. Subsidies to many industries, notably agriculture, were removed or significantly reduced, as was tariff protection. The top marginal tax rate was halved over a number of years from 66% to 33%, and the standard rate was reduced from 42% in 1978 to 28% in 1988. To compensate, the variable sales taxes that had been in effect until then were replaced by a single Goods and Services Tax, initially set at 10%, later 12.5% (and eventually in 2011, 15%), and a surtax on superannuation, which had been made universal from age 60 by the previous government.

==Immediate results==
New Zealand&#x27;s leap into the neoliberal global economy exposed both businesses and the wider workforce to the unregulated practices of private capital – this led to a decade of insignificant (and sometimes negative) growth with the &quot;economic miracle&quot; being experienced by only a relatively small proportion of the population. With no restrictions on overseas money coming into the country the focus in the economy shifted from the productive sector to finance. Finance capital outstripped industrial capital and redundancies occurred in manufacturing industry; approximately 76,000 manufacturing jobs were lost between 1987 and 1992. The new state-owned enterprises created from 1 April 1987 began to shed thousands of jobs adding to unemployment: 

The newly unfettered business environment created by the deregulation of the financial sector, David Grant writes, left New Zealanders &quot;easy targets for speculators and their agents&quot;, exacerbating the effects of the October 1987 stock market crash.

During wage bargaining in 1986 and 1987, employers started to bargain harder. Lock-outs were not uncommon; the most spectacular occurred at a pulp and paper mill owned by Fletcher Challenge and led to changes to work practices and a no-strike commitment from the union. Later settlements drew further concessions from unions, including below-inflation wage increases, and an effective real wage cut. There was a structural change in the economy from industry to services, which, along with the arrival of trans-Tasman retail chains and an increasingly cosmopolitan hospitality industry, led to a new ‘café culture’ enjoyed by more affluent New Zealanders. Some argue that for the rest of the population, Rogernomics failed to deliver the higher standard of living promised by its advocates.

Over 15 years, New Zealand&#x27;s economy and social capital faced serious problems: the proliferation of food banks increased dramatically to an estimated 365 in 1994; the number of New Zealanders estimated to be living in poverty grew by at least 35% between 1989 and 1992 while child poverty doubled from 14% in 1982 to 29% in 1994. Those on low incomes failed to return to the 1984 standard of living until 1996; the lowest 30% did not recover their own 1980s living standards for twenty years. The health of the New Zealand population was also especially hard-hit, leading to a significant deterioration in health standards among working and middle-class people. In addition, many of the promised economic benefits of the experiment never materialised. Between 1985 and 1992, New Zealand&#x27;s economy grew by 4.7% during the same period in which the average OECD nation grew by 28.2%. From 1984 to 1993 inflation averaged 9% per year and New Zealand&#x27;s credit rating dropped twice. Between 1986 and 1992, the unemployment rate rose from 3.6% to 11%.

Rogernomics, however, has been credited with a number of other positive impacts on the New Zealand economy: inflation, which had reached a high of 17.15% in 1980, has been in single digits every year since the end of Douglas&#x27; tenure as finance minister; and income tax rates were halved, while gross national income per capita almost doubled, from $6,950 USD in 1984 to $13,640 USD in 1990. Other supporters of Rogernomics have argued that many statistics do not take into account the improvements in consumer goods it brought, transforming New Zealand from a country where permits were needed to buy overseas magazines, and where prices were high and choice was limited, into a country with a range of consumer goods available similar to those enjoyed by other western democracies. Douglas himself has claimed that the unwillingness of subsequent governments to alter any of his reforms is a testament to their quality.

==Legacy==
The policies of Ruth Richardson, sometimes called &quot;Ruthanasia&quot;, were a continuation of Rogernomics. Richardson served as Finance Minister in the National Party government from 1990 to 1993. Beginning with the Mother of all Budgets, the National Government expanded these policies by drastically cutting spending, deregulating labour markets, and further asset sales.

In 1990 David Lange said of the Government: &quot;It is there to be the securer of its citizen[s&#x27;] welfare. Where the market works well, it should be given its head. Where the market results in manifest inequity, or poor economic performance, the Government must get involved.&quot;

After Rogernomics, the New Zealand Labour Party was paralysed by infighting for much of their time in opposition, initially led by Mike Moore as leader of the Opposition (1990–1993). Moore was then followed by Helen Clark, whose first term as leader of the Opposition was undermined by those who opposed her leadership. Some later left to form their own political parties ACT, the Alliance, and United (later United Future). Clark for her part survived these internal leadership scuffles and Labour stabilised under her leadership during the third and final term of the Jim Bolger and Jenny Shipley ministries. Much like Tony Blair in the United Kingdom, Clark assumed a compromise solution to social exclusion and poverty, combining advocacy of the open economy and of free trade with greater emphasis on fighting the consequences of neoliberal policies. Labour became loosely aligned with the Third Way between 1999 and 2008.

The ACT Party, co-founded by Roger Douglas in 1993 to participate in the 1996 MMP election, is the heir to Rogernomics and continues to advance free-market policies. In 1990s New Zealand, advocates of radical economic policies were often branded as &quot;rogergnomes&quot; by their opponents, linking their views to Douglas&#x27;s and to the supposed baleful influence of international bankers, characterised as the &quot;Gnomes of Zurich&quot;.

A 2015 Treasury report said that inequality in New Zealand increased in the 1980s and 1990s but has been stable for the last 20 years.
However, another 2015 article reported that New Zealand&#x27;s rate of rise of inequality had been the highest in the OECD, and that New Zealand&#x27;s inequality had previously been low by OECD standards.

<text>Leopold Vietoris ( , , ; 4 June 1891 – 9 April 2002) was an Austrian mathematician, World War I veteran and supercentenarian. He was born in Radkersburg and died in Innsbruck.

He was known for his contributions to topology—notably the Mayer–Vietoris sequence—and other fields of mathematics, his interest in mathematical history, and for being a keen alpinist.

==Biography==
Vietoris studied mathematics and geometry at the Vienna University of Technology.
He was drafted in 1914 in World War I and was wounded in September that same year. On 4 November 1918, one week before the Armistice of Villa Giusti, he became an Italian prisoner of war. After returning to Austria, he attended the University of Vienna, where he earned his PhD in 1920, with a thesis written under the supervision of Gustav von Escherich and Wilhelm Wirtinger.

In autumn 1928 he married his first wife Klara Riccabona, who later died while giving birth to their sixth daughter. In 1936 he married Klara&#x27;s sister, Maria Riccabona.

Vietoris was survived by his six daughters, 17 grandchildren, and 30 great-grandchildren.

He lends his name to a few mathematical concepts:
*Vietoris topology (see topological space)
*Vietoris homology (see homology theory)
*Mayer–Vietoris sequence
*Vietoris–Begle mapping theorem
*Vietoris–Rips complex

Vietoris remained scientifically active in his later years, even writing one paper on trigonometric sums at the age of 103.

Vietoris lived to be 110 years and 309 days old, and became the oldest verified Austrian man ever.

==Decorations and awards==
* Austrian Decoration for Science and Art (1973)
* Grand Gold Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria (1981)
* Honorary member of the German Mathematical Society (1992)

<text>Concerto per Theremin. Live in Italy is Lydia Kavina&#x27;s second album. It was recorded in Italy in 1998 and released on CD by Teleura in 2000.

==Theremin &amp; Lydia Kavina==

Invented in 1919 in Russia by Lev Sergeivitch Termen, the Theremin was not only the first electronic musical instrument, but also the first (and still the only) instrument played without touching it by moving the hands in the space between two antennas, one of which controls intonation and the other the volume.

Lydia Kavina is universally recognised as being the greatest virtuoso of the Theremin in the world. The niece of one of Lev Termen&#x27;s first-degree cousins, Kavina began studying the Theremin under the direction of Termen himself when she was nine years old. Five years later, she was ready to give her first Theremin concert, which marked the beginning of a musical career that has so far led to more than 500 theatre, radio and television performances throughout the world.

In addition to giving concerts, Kavina is a composer of music for the Theremin (three of her works can be heard on this disc) and teaches the instrument in Russia, the United States and Western Europe.

Together with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, she participated in creating the sound track of the Oscar-winning film &quot;Ed Wood&quot;.

In 1999 has been published Lydia&#x27;s first disc entitled &quot;Music from the Ether&quot;.

<text>La Rochelle (, , ; Poitevin-Saintongeais: &quot;La Rochéle&quot;) is a city on the west coast of France and a seaport on the Bay of Biscay, a part of the Atlantic Ocean. It is the capital of the Charente-Maritime department. With 78,535 inhabitants in 2021, La Rochelle is the most populated commune in the department and ranks fourth in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region after Bordeaux, the regional capital, Limoges and Poitiers.

Situated on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean the city is connected to the Île de Ré by a bridge completed on 19 May 1988. Since the Middle Ages the harbour has opened onto a protected strait, the Pertuis d&#x27;Antioche and is regarded as a &quot;Door océane&quot; or gateway to the ocean because of the presence of its three ports (fishing, trade and yachting). The city has a strong commercial tradition, having an active port from very early on in its history.

The city traces its origins to the Gallo-Roman period, attested by the remains of important salt marshes and villas. The Dukes of Aquitaine granted it a charter as a free port in 1130. With the opening of the English market following the second marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152, the presence of the Knights Templar and the Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem quickly made this small town the largest port on the Atlantic.

To this day, the city still possesses a rich historical fabric, including the Saint-Nicholas tower, and an urban heritage. The capital of Aunis, it has become the most important coastal city between the Loire and Gironde estuaries. La Rochelle&#x27;s urban activities are many in number and strongly differentiated, being a city with port and industrial functions that are still important, but also including a predominantly administrative and tertiary sector that is reinforced by the university and a rapidly developing tourism industry. In the early 21st century, the city has consistently been ranked among France&#x27;s most liveable cities. Until 2015, the town was part of the administrative region called Poitou-Charentes, that was before the delimitation of regions in France.

==History==
===Antiquity===
The Romans subsequently occupied the area, where they developed salt production along the coast. Roman villas have been found at Saint-Éloi and at Les Minimes. Salt evaporation ponds dating from the same period have also been found.

===Foundation===
The name was first recorded in 961 as &quot;Rupella&quot;, from a Latin diminutive meaning &#x27;little rock&#x27;. It was later known as &quot;Rocella&quot; and &quot;Roscella&quot; before the name took on its current form. The establishment of La Rochelle as a harbour was a consequence of the victory of Duke Guillaume X of Aquitaine over Isambert de Châtelaillon in 1130, and the subsequent destruction of his harbour of Châtelaillon. In 1137, Guillaume X to all intents and purposes made La Rochelle a free port and gave it the right to identify as a commune.

Fifty years later Eleanor of Aquitaine upheld the communal charter promulgated by her father. For the first time in France, a city mayor was appointed for La Rochelle, Guillaume de Montmirail. Guillaume was assisted in his responsibilities by 24 municipal magistrates, and 75 nobles who had jurisdiction over the inhabitants.

===Plantagenet rule (1154–1224)===

Eleanor married Henry Plantagenet in 1152, who became king of England as Henry II in 1154, thus putting La Rochelle under Plantagenet rule, until Louis VIII captured it in the 1224 siege of La Rochelle. During the Plantagenet control of the city in 1185, Henry II had the Vauclair castle built, remains of which are still visible in the Place de Verdun.

The main activities of the city were in the areas of maritime commerce and trade, especially with England, the Netherlands and Spain. In 1196, wealthy bourgeois Alexandre Auffredi sent a fleet of seven ships to Africa seeking wealth. He went bankrupt awaiting the return of his ships; they returned seven years later bearing riches.

===Knights Templar===
The Knights Templar had a strong presence in La Rochelle since before the time of Eleanor of Aquitaine, who exempted them from duties and gave them mills in her 1139 Charter. La Rochelle was the Templars&#x27; largest base on the Atlantic Ocean, and where they stationed their main fleet. From La Rochelle, they were able to act as intermediaries in trade between England and the Mediterranean. A popular thread of conspiracy theory originating with &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; has it that the Templars used a fleet of 18 ships which had brought Jacques de Molay from Cyprus to La Rochelle to escape arrest in France. The fleet allegedly left laden with knights and treasures just before the issue of the warrant for the arrest of the Order in October 1307.

===Hundred Years&#x27; War===
Royal property since 1271, the 1293 sacking of La Rochelle by the Bayonnais during an outbreak of reciprocal piracy between English and French (particularly Norman) sailors was one of the main charges of King PhilipIV against King EdwardI when he declared the Duchy of Aquitaine forfeit to the French crown, prompting the 1294–1303 Gascon War whose peace terms produced the marriage that led to EdwardIII&#x27;s later claims to the French crown.

Following the Treaty of Brétigny during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, La Rochelle again came under the rule of the English monarch in 1360. La Rochelle however expelled the English in June 1372, following the naval Battle of La Rochelle, between Castilian-French and English fleets. The French and Spanish decisively defeated the English, securing French control of the Channel for the first time since the Battle of Sluys in 1340. The naval battle of La Rochelle was one of the first cases of the use of handguns on warships, which were deployed by the French and Spanish against the English. Having recovered freedom, La Rochelle refused entry to Du Guesclin, until Charles V recognized the privileges of the city in November 1372.

In 1402, the French adventurer Jean de Béthencourt left La Rochelle and sailed along the coast of Morocco to conquer the Canary Islands.

Until the 15th century, La Rochelle was to be the largest French harbour on the Atlantic coast, dealing mainly in wine, salt and cheese.

===French Wars of Religion===
During the Renaissance, La Rochelle adopted Protestant ideas. Calvinism started to be propagated in the region of La Rochelle, resulting in its suppression through the establishment of &quot;Cours présidiaux&quot; tribunals by Henry II. An early result of this was the burning at the stake of two &quot;heretics&quot; in La Rochelle in 1552. Conversions to Calvinism however continued, due to a change of religious beliefs, but also to a desire for political independence on the part of the local elite, and a popular opposition to royal expenses and requisitions in the building projects to fortify the coast against England.

On the initiative of Gaspard de Coligny, the Calvinists attempted to colonise the New World to find a new home for their religion, with the likes of Pierre Richier and Jean de Léry. After the short-lived attempt of France Antarctique, they failed to establish a colony in Brazil, and finally resolved to make a stand in La Rochelle itself. Pierre Richier became &quot;Ministre de l&#x27;église de la Rochelle&quot; (&quot;Minister of the Church of La Rochelle&quot;) when he returned from Brazil in 1558, and was able to considerably increase the Huguenot presence in La Rochelle, from a small base of about 50 souls who had been secretly educated in the Lutheran faith by Charles de Clermont the previous year. He has been described, by Lancelot Voisin de La Popelinière, as &quot;le père de l&#x27;église de La Rochelle&quot; (&quot;The Father of the Church of La Rochelle&quot;).

La Rochelle was the first French city, with Rouen, to experience iconoclastic riots in 1560, at the time of the suppression of the Amboise conspiracy, before the riots spread to many other cities. Further cases of Reformation iconoclasm were recorded in La Rochelle from 30 May 1562, following the Massacre of Vassy. Protestants pillaged churches, destroyed images and statues, and also assassinated 13 Catholic priests in the Tower of the Lantern.

From 1568, La Rochelle became a centre for the Huguenots, and the city declared itself an independent Reformed Republic on the model of Geneva. During the subsequent period, La Rochelle became an entity that has been described as a &quot;state within a state&quot;. This led to numerous conflicts with the Catholic central government. The city supported the Protestant movement of William of Orange in the Netherlands, and from La Rochelle the Dutch under Louis of Nassau and the &quot;Sea Beggars&quot; were able to raid Spanish shipping.

In 1571 the city of La Rochelle suffered a naval blockade by the French Navy under the command of Filippo di Piero Strozzi and Antoine Escalin des Aimars, a former protagonist of the Franco-Ottoman alliance. The city was finally besieged during the siege of La Rochelle (1572–1573) during the French Wars of Religion, following the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre in August 1572, and occurred at the same time as other sieges of Protestant cities such as the siege of Sancerre. The conflict ended with the 1573 Peace of La Rochelle, which restricted the Protestant worship to the three cities of Montauban, Nîmes and La Rochelle. Pierre Richier died in La Rochelle in 1580.

===Huguenot rebellions===

Under Henry IV, and under the regency of his son Louis XIII, the city enjoyed a certain freedom and prosperity. However, La Rochelle entered into conflict with the authority of the adult Louis, beginning with a 1622 revolt. A fleet from La Rochelle fought a royal fleet of 35 ships under Charles, Duke of Guise, in front of Saint-Martin-de-Ré, but was defeated on 27 October 1622, leading to the signing of the Peace of Montpellier.

====Revolt of Soubise (1625)====

In 1625, a new Huguenot revolt led by Duke Henri de Rohan and his brother Soubise led to the Capture of Ré island by the forces of Louis XIII. Soubise conquered large parts of the Atlantic coast, but the supporting fleet of La Rochelle was finally defeated by Montmorency, as was Soubise with 3,000 when he led a counter-attack against the royal troops who had landed on the island of Ré.

====Siege of La Rochelle (1627–1628)====

Following these events, Louis XIII and his Chief Minister Cardinal Richelieu declared the suppression of the Huguenot revolt the first priority of the kingdom. The English came to the support of La Rochelle, starting the Anglo-French War, by sending a major expedition under the Duke of Buckingham. The expedition however ended in a fiasco for England with the siege of Saint-Martin-de-Ré. Meanwhile, cannon shots were exchanged on 10 September 1627 between La Rochelle and Royal troops. This resulted in the siege of La Rochelle in which Cardinal Richelieu blockaded the city for 14 months, until the city surrendered and lost its mayor and its privileges.

The remaining Protestants of La Rochelle suffered new persecutions, when 300 families were again expelled in November 1661, the year Louis XIV came to power. The reason for the expulsions was that Catholics deeply resented a degree of revival of Protestant ownership of property within the city.

The growing persecution of the Huguenots culminated with the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV in 1685. Many Huguenots emigrated, founding such cities as New Rochelle in the vicinity of today&#x27;s New York in 1689. La Rochelle, and the siege of 1627 form much of the backdrop to the later chapters of Alexandre Dumas, père&#x27;s classic novel, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;.

===La Rochelle and the New World===


Because of its western location, which saved days of sailing time, La Rochelle enjoyed successful fishing in the western Atlantic and trading with the New World, which served to counterbalance the disadvantage of not being at the mouth of a river (useful for shipping goods to and from the interior). Its Protestant ship-owning and merchant class prospered in the 16th century until the Wars of Religion devastated the city. The British navy in wartime were alert that shore watchers at La Rochelle were employed.

The period following the wars was a prosperous one, marked by intense exchanges with the New World (Nouvelle France in Canada, and the Antilles). La Rochelle &quot;armateurs&quot; (shipowners) became very active in triangular trade with the New World, dealing in the slave trade with Africa, sugar trade with plantations of the West Indies, and fur trade with Canada. This was a period of high artistic, cultural and architectural achievements for the city. La Rochelle was also the port city from which the Carignan-Salieres Regiment departed for Nouvelle France. In 1664, based upon attacks by the Iroquois against the Quebec inhabitants and following the request of the New France Sovereign Council, the French finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert ordered the 24 companies composing the Carignan-Salières Regiment to duty in New France. Beginning with departures from the port of La Rochelle, France on 19 Apr 1665, five troop ships and one supply ship left the French coast. A sixth troop ship, Le Breze, began the journey from the Antilles island in the West Indies. All of the seven ships arrived at Quebec City during the three-month period between 19 Jun 1665 and 14 Sep 1665. They carried approximately 1,200 men of the regiment. Additionally, it was from this port city that many of the estimated 768 women known as the Filles du Roi (Daughters of the King), set sail for Quebec during the period of 1663 to 1673.

Robert de La Salle departed from La Rochelle, France, on 24 July 1684, with the aim of setting up a colony at the mouth of the Mississippi, eventually establishing Fort Saint Louis in Texas.

The city eventually lost its trade and prominence during the decades spanning the Seven Years&#x27; War, the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. During that period France lost many of the territorial possessions which it had had in the New World, and also saw a significant decrease in its sea power in the continuing conflicts with Britain, ultimately diminishing the role of such harbours as La Rochelle. After abolitionist movements led by such people as Samuel de Missy, the slave trade of La Rochelle ended with the onset of the French Revolution and the war with England in the 1790s, the last La Rochelle slave ship, the &quot;Saint-Jacques&quot; being captured in 1793 in the Gulf of Guinea. In February 1794, the National Convention passed the Law of 4 February 1794, which effectively freed all colonial slaves.

In 1809, the Battle of the Basque Roads took place near La Rochelle, in which a British fleet defeated the French Atlantic Fleet.

===La Rochelle faience===

La Rochelle became one of the French centres for faience at the end of the 18th century. Bernard Palissy was born in the region and had some bearing in this development. During the 18th century, its style was greatly influenced by Chinese themes and Japanese Kakiemon-type designs. Many of these ceramics can be viewed at the Musée d&#x27;Orbigny-Bernon. 
===19th century===
In 1864, the harbour of La Rochelle (area of the &quot;Bassin à flot&quot; behind the water locks), was the site for the maiden dive experiments of the first mechanically-powered submarine in the World, &quot;Plongeur&quot;, commanded by Marie-Joseph-Camille Doré, a native of La Rochelle.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, Germany established a submarine naval base at La Pallice (the main port of La Rochelle).

A German stronghold, La Rochelle was the last French city to be liberated at the end of the war. The Allied siege of La Rochelle took place between 12 September 1944 and 7 May 1945. The stronghold, including the islands of Ré and Oléron, was held by 20,000 German troops under German vice-admiral Ernst Schirlitz. Following negotiations by the French Navy frigate captain Meyer, the general German capitulation occurred on 7 May and French troops entered La Rochelle on 8 May.

The submarine base became the setting for parts of the movie . The U-boat scenes in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; were also shot in La Rochelle. The base is featured in the computer game &quot;Commandos 2: Men of Courage&quot;. It was also chosen in 2018 for the location shooting of the German television series &quot;Das Boot&quot; (a sequel to the 1981 classic).

==La Rochelle today==

La Rochelle possesses a commercial deep water harbour, named La Pallice. The large submarine pens built during World War II still stand there, although they are not in use. La Pallice is equipped with oil unloading equipment, and mainly handles tropical wood. It is also the location of the fishing fleet, which was moved from the old harbour in the centre of the city during the 1980s.
La Rochelle has a very big aquarium, and a small botanical garden (the &quot;Jardin des plantes de La Rochelle&quot;).

The &quot;Calypso&quot;, the ship used by Jacques-Yves Cousteau as a mobile laboratory for oceanography, and which was sunk after a collision in the port of Singapore (1996) is now on display (rotting) at the Maritime Museum of La Rochelle.

The French Socialist Party has held its annual summer convention (&quot;Université d&#x27;été&quot;) in La Rochelle since 1983.

===Culture===

The Festival de la Fiction is a film festival that films screens new films in official competitions (French, European, and other Francophone countries), out of competition, and also in special screenings. The first ten years of the festival, from around 1998, took place in Saint-Tropez, before moving to La Rochelle in around 2013 or 2014.

One of the biggest music festivals in France, Les Francofolies de La Rochelle, takes place each summer in La Rochelle, where Francophone musicians come together for a week of concerts and celebration. 2004 marked the 20th anniversary of this event.

===Tourism===

La Rochelle&#x27;s main feature is the &quot;Vieux Port&quot; (&quot;Old Harbour&quot;), which is at the heart of the city, picturesque and lined with seafood restaurants. The city walls are open to an evening promenade. The old town has been well preserved. Three medieval towers are a prominent tourist attraction at the entrance to the harbor: The Chain Tower, The Lantern Tower and Saint Nicolas Tower. From the harbour, boating trips can be taken to the Île d&#x27;Aix and Fort Boyard (home to the TV show of the same name). Nearby Île de Ré is a short drive to the North. The countryside of the surrounding Charente-Maritime is very rural and full of history (Saintes). To the North is Venise Verte, a marshy area of country, crisscrossed with tiny canals and a resort for inland boating. Inland is the country of Cognac and Pineau. The nearby Île de Ré is accessible via a bridge from La Rochelle.


===Transport===
La Rochelle and its region are served by the international La Rochelle - Île de Ré Airport, which has progressively developed over the last 5 years. The train station Gare de La Rochelle offers connections to Bordeaux, Nantes, Poitiers, Paris and several regional destinations.

OFP La Rochelle is a freight railway serving the port.

La Rochelle launched one of the first successful bicycle sharing systems in 1974. 

===Education===
The original university in La Rochelle was University Institutes of Technology, established in 1968. Then, University of La Rochelle was incorporated to the technology institute in 1993. And, the second university in the city is the Excelia Group (La Rochelle Business School), which was established in 1988. The city has more than 10,000 students each year, with 7,000 and 3,500 students respectively.

===Les Minimes===

Located in La Rochelle is Les Minimes, a marina considered the city&#x27;s new port for around 5,000 boat vessels. The newly built area also houses university campuses for 10,000 students, which has shops, restaurants, a cinema, and other amenities. There are many residences in a student village, which are accommodation for locals, students or tourists. The port is the biggest in Europe, and has a long boat-building past, which today includes companies such as Amel Yachts.

==Geography==

===Geology===
The bedrock of La Rochelle and surrounding areas is composed of layers of limestone dating back to the Sequanian stage (upper Oxfordian stage) of the Jurassic period (circa 160 million years ago), when a large part of France was submerged. Many of these layers are visible in the white cliffs that border the sea, which contain many small marine fossils. Layers of thick white rock, formed during period of relatively warm seas, alternate with highly fragile layers containing sand and remains of mud, formed during colder periods, and with layers containing various corals, that were formed during warmer, tropical times. The limestone thus formed is traditionally used as the main building material throughout the region.

The area of La Pointe du Chay about from La Rochelle is a cliff area visited for leisurely geological surveys.

===Climate===
Under Köppen&#x27;s climate classification, La Rochelle features an oceanic climate. Although at the same latitude as Montreal in Canada or the Kuril Islands in Russia, the area experiences mild weather throughout the year due to the influence of the Gulf Stream waters, the summers are relatively warm, and insolation is remarkably high—the highest in Western France, including sea resorts much further to the south such as Biarritz. La Rochelle seldom experiences very cold or very warm weather. These specific conditions – summer: dry and sunny, winter: mild and wet – have led to the establishment of a Mediterranean-type vegetation cohabiting with more continental and oceanic types of vegetation.
==Population==
Its inhabitants are called &quot;les Rochelaises&quot; and &quot;les Rochelais&quot; in French. The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of La Rochelle proper, in its geography at the given years.

<text>Rochefort (; ), unofficially Rochefort-sur-Mer (; ) for disambiguation, is a city and commune in Southwestern France, a port on the Charente estuary. It is a subprefecture of the Charente-Maritime department, located in the administrative region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine (before 2015: Poitou-Charentes).

==Geography==
Rochefort lies on the river Charente, close to its outflow into the Atlantic Ocean. It is about 30 km southeast of La Rochelle. Rochefort station has rail connections to La Rochelle, Nantes and Bordeaux.

==History==
In December 1665, Rochefort was chosen by Jean-Baptiste Colbert as a place of &quot;refuge, defence and supply&quot; for the French Navy. The Arsenal de Rochefort served as a naval base and dockyard until it closed in 1926.

In September 1757, Rochefort was the target of an ambitious British raid during the Seven Years&#x27; War.
Another infrastructure of early Rochefort from 1766 was its &quot;bagne&quot;, a high-security penal colony involving hard labour. &quot;Bagnes&quot; were then common fixtures in military harbors and naval bases, such as Toulon or Brest, because they provided free labor. During the Jacobin period of the French Revolution (1790–95), over 800 Roman Catholic priests and other clergy who refused to take the anti-Papal oath of the &quot;Civil Constitution of the Clergy&quot; were put aboard a fleet of prison ships in Rochefort harbour, where most died due to inhumane conditions.

Off Rochefort, from the island of Île-d&#x27;Aix where he had spent several days hoping to flee to America, Napoleon Bonaparte surrendered to Captain F. L. Maitland aboard HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, on 17 July 1815, ending the &quot;Hundred Days&quot;.

Rochefort is a notable example of 17th-century &quot;ville nouvelle&quot; or new town, which means its design and building resulted from a political decree. The reason for building Rochefort was to a large extent that royal power could hardly depend on rebellious Protestant La Rochelle, which Cardinal Richelieu had to besiege a few decades earlier. Well into the 20th century, Rochefort remained primarily a garrison town. The tourist industry, which had long existed due to the town&#x27;s spa, gained emphasis in the 1990s.

==Population==

==Sights==
Noteworthy buildings of the original naval establishment include:
* a hospital, incorporating a School of Naval Medicine (now a museum)

<text>Arras ( , ; ; historical ) is the prefecture of the Pas-de-Calais department, which forms part of the region of Hauts-de-France; before the reorganization of 2014 it was in Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The historic centre of the Artois region, with a Baroque town square, Arras is in northern France at the confluence of the rivers Scarpe and Crinchon.

The Arras plain is on a large chalk plateau bordered on the north by the Marqueffles fault, on the southwest by the Artois and Ternois hills, and on the south by the slopes of Beaufort-Blavincourt. On the east it is connected to the Scarpe valley.

Saint Vedast (or St. Vaast) was the first Catholic bishop in the year 499 and tried to eliminate paganism among the Franks. By 843, Arras was seat of the County of Artois which became part of the Royal domain in 1191. The first mention of the name &quot;Arras&quot; appeared in the 12th century. Some hypothesize it is a contraction of &quot;Atrebates&quot;, a Belgic tribe of Gaul and Britain that used to inhabit the area. The name &quot;Atrebates&quot; could have successively evolved to become &quot;Atrades&quot;, &quot;Atradis&quot;, &quot;Aras&quot;, and finally &quot;Arras&quot;. Others believe it comes from the Celtic word &quot;Ar&quot;, meaning &#x27;running water&#x27;, as the Scarpe river flows through Arras or simply the name of Abraham&#x27;s wife Sarra spelled backwards.

Arras is Pas-de-Calais&#x27; third most populous town after Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer. The town counted 43,693 residents in 2012, with the Arras metropolitan area having a population of 124,200. Arras is located north of Paris and can be reached in 2 hours by car and in 50 minutes by TGV. It is the historic centre of the former Artois province. Its local speech is characterized as a patois. The city of Arras is well known for its architecture, culture, and history. It was once part of the Spanish Netherlands, a portion of the Low Countries controlled by Spain from 1556 to 1714. Louis XIII reconquered Arras in 1640; the town officially became part of France in 1659.

Arras attracts thousands of visitors every year, who commonly explore the city&#x27;s architecture and historic buildings. Some attractions include the Town Hall and its Belfry (listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 15 July 2005), the &quot;Boves&quot; (a maze beneath the city), the Squares (&quot;La Place des Héros&quot; and &quot;La Grand&#x27;Place&quot;), the Art District (the Theatre of Arras and the &quot;Hôtel de Guînes&quot;), the Abbey District (The Saint-Vaast Abbey and the Cathedral of Arras), the Vauban Citadel, and the &quot;Nemetacum&quot; site (the ancient town founded by the Romans 2000 years ago). The Canadian National Vimy Memorial is just outside the town.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Archaeologists found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the Scarpe basin. The archaeological sites of Mont-Saint-Vaast in Arras and Biache-Saint-Vaast were Stone Age settlements of the Mousterian culture. They were evidenced by the finds of stone tools. These tools show signs of the Levallois technique, a name given by archaeologists to a distinctive type of stone knapping, developed by forerunners to modern humans during the Paleolithic period 170,000 years ago.

Very little was found to document the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age in the Arras area.

===Antiquity/Foundation===
Arras was founded on the hill of Baudimont by the Belgic tribe of the Atrebates, who named it &quot;Nemetocenna&quot; in reference to a &quot;nemeton&quot; that probably existed there.

In the Scarpe valley, archaeologists&#x27; excavations and data recovery revealed Late Iron Age settlements. These buildings, believed to be farms, were found near the municipalities of Arras, Hamblain-les-Prés and Saint-Pol.

The town was later renamed &quot;Nemetacum&quot;/&quot;Atrebatum&quot; by the Romans, under whom it became an important garrison town. No traces of any amenities such as a forum, theatre, or basilica have been identified. One discovery has been &quot;one of the rare sanctuaries devoted to the oriental god Attis in France&quot;.

===Medieval and early modern period===

====Before the Middle Ages====

In the 4th century, &quot;Nemetacum&quot; was renowned for its arts and crafts as well as textiles trade throughout the whole empire. Between 406 and 407, the city was taken and destroyed by Germanic invaders. In 428, the Salian Franks led by Clodion le Chevelu took control of the region including the current Somme department. Roman General Aetius then chose to negotiate for peace and concluded a treaty (&quot;fœdus&quot;) with Clodion that gave the Franks the status of «foederati» fighting for Rome.

The town&#x27;s people were converted to Christianity in the late 4th century by Saint Innocent, who was killed in 410 during a barbarian attack on the town. In 499, after the conversion of Clovis I to Catholicism, a diocese (&quot;évêché&quot; in French) was created in Arras, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arras, and given to Saint Vaast (also known as &quot;Saint Vedast&quot; in English), who remains the diocesan patron saint. Saint Vaast then established an episcopal see and a monastic community. It was suppressed in 580 to found the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cambrai, from which it would reemerge 5 centuries later.

====Early Middle Ages====
In 667 Saint Aubert, bishop of Cambrai, decided to found the Abbey of Saint Vaast, which developed during the Carolingian period into an immensely wealthy Benedictine abbey. The modern town of Arras initially spread around the abbey as a grain market. During the 9th century, both town and abbey suffered from the attacks of the Vikings, who later settled to the west in Normandy. The abbey revived its strength in the 11th century and played an important role in the development of medieval painting, successfully synthesizing the artistic styles of Carolingian, Ottonian and English art.

====High Middle Ages====

In 1025, a Catholic council was held at Arras against certain Manichaean (dualistic) heretics who rejected the sacraments of the Church. In 1093, the bishopric of Arras was refounded on territory split from the Diocese of Cambrai. In 1097 two councils, presided over by Lambert of Arras, dealt with questions concerning monasteries and persons consecrated to God. In this time, Arras became an important cultural centre, especially for the group of poets who came to be known as trouvères. One particular society of such poets was later called the &quot;Puy d&#x27;Arras&quot;.

====The wool industry and trade====
The town was granted a commercial charter by the French crown in 1180 and became an internationally important location for banking and trade. The wool industry of Arras, established in the 4th century, became of great importance during the Middle Ages. Already in the 3rd century Romans had lauded the quality of wool from Tournai and Arras. By the 11th century Arras was the leading city and trading hub of the wool industry. This prominence would eventually shift towards areas north of Arras, and cities such as Lille, Douai and Saint-Omer, followed by Ypres and eventually Bruges would become the centres of the wool industry and trade. However, by the 14th century Arras still was renowned and drew considerable wealth from the cloth and wool industry, and was particularly well known for its production of fine tapestries—so much so that in English and Italian the word &quot;Arras&quot; (&quot;Arazzi&quot; in Italian) was adopted to refer to tapestries in general. The patronage of wealthy cloth merchants ensured that the town became an important cultural centre, with major figures such as the poet Jean Bodel and the trouvère Adam de la Halle making their homes in Arras.

====Late Middle Ages====
The ownership of the town was repeatedly disputed along with the rest of Artois. During the Middle Ages, possession of Arras passed to a variety of feudal rulers and fiefs, including the County of Flanders, the Duchy of Burgundy, the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg and the French crown. In 1430, Joan of Arc (&quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; in French), was imprisoned in the region of Arras. The town was the site of the Congress of Arras in 1435, an unsuccessful attempt to end the Hundred Years&#x27; War that resulted in the Burgundians breaking their alliance with the English. After the death of Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1477, King Louis XI of France took control of Arras but the town&#x27;s inhabitants, still loyal to the Burgundians, expelled the French. This prompted Louis XI to besiege Arras in person and, after taking it by assault, he had the town&#x27;s walls razed and its inhabitants expelled, to be replaced by more loyal subjects from other parts of France. In a bid to erase the town&#x27;s identity completely, Louis renamed it temporarily to &quot;Franchise&quot;. In 1482, the Peace of Arras was signed in the town to end a war between Louis XI and Maximilian I of Austria; ten years later, the town was ceded to Maximilian. It was eventually bequeathed to the Spanish Habsburgs as part of the Spanish Netherlands.

====Renaissance====

Arras remained under Habsburg rule from 1493 until 1640 when it was captured by the French. The Spanish ceded it by the peace treaty in 1659 and it has since remained French. The Union of Arras was signed here in January 1579 by the Catholic principalities of the Low Countries that remained loyal to King Philip II of Habsburg; it provoked the declaration of the Union of Utrecht later the same month.

===Modern period===

During the War of the Spanish Succession, in 1712, Arras was bombarded by an Anglo-Dutch Army under Arnold van Keppel, the Earl of Albemarle.

====French Revolution====
Maximilien de Robespierre, a French lawyer and politician from Arras and one of the best-known and most influential figures of the French Revolution, was elected fifth deputy of the third estate of Artois to the Estates-General in 1789. Robespierre also helped draft the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

During the French Revolution, the city of Arras was first presided over by French reformer Dubois de Fosseux, erudite squire, secretary of the Arras district (&quot;arrondissement&quot; in French) and future president of the Pas-de-Calais department. Around the same time, competing against Aire-sur-la-Lys, Calais, and Saint-Omer, Arras won the prefecture of Pas-de-Calais. From September 1793 to July 1794, during the Reign of Terror, the city was under the supervision of Joseph Lebon who implemented food restrictions, ordered 400 executions and destroyed several religious monuments including the Arras Cathedral and the Abbey of St. Vaast. Arras&#x27; demography and economic activity remained the same throughout the French Revolution while Lille&#x27;s grew exponentially. In 1898, under the influence of Mayor Émile Legrelle, some of Arras&#x27; ramparts were demolished to build vast boulevards, establish a new sewage system and replace the old railway station from 1846.

====World Wars====

===== World War I =====
During most of the First World War, Arras was about away from the front line, and a series of battles took place around the city and nearby, including the Battle of Arras (1914), the Battle of Arras (1917), and the Second Battle of the Somme component of 1918&#x27;s Hundred Days Offensive.

On 31 August 1914, German light cavalry (Uhlans) arrived in Tilloy-lès-Mofflaines, and an army patrol made a foray into Arras. On 6 September 1914, 3,000 soldiers led by General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim barracked within the city and in the citadel. Shortly after, Louis Ernest de Maud&#x27;huy&#x27;s soldiers partly repelled the German army troops, and trenches were dug in the &quot;Faubourgs d&#x27;Arras&quot;. On 7 October 1914 the city hall burned. On 21 October 1914 the belfry was destroyed, and so was Arras Cathedral on 6 July 1915.

In 1917, a series of medieval tunnels beneath the city, linked and greatly expanded by the New Zealand Tunnelling Company, became a decisive factor in the British forces holding the city - particularly during that year&#x27;s Battle of Arras.

By the end of World War I (1918), the city was so heavily damaged that three-quarters had to be rebuilt. The reconstruction was extremely costly, yet it proved to be a success and allowed the city to expand.

The town is located approximately south of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial built in 1936 on Hill 145, the highest point of the Vimy Ridge escarpment. It is dedicated to the Battle of Vimy Ridge assault (part of the 1917 Battle of Arras) and the missing First World War Canadian soldiers with no known grave; it is also the site of two WWI Canadian cemeteries.

On 9 April 2017, the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, Arras Mayor Frédéric Leturque thanked Canadians, as well as Australians and British, New Zealanders and South Africans, for their role in the First World War battles in the area.

===== World War II =====
In the early stages of the second World War, during the invasion of France in May 1940, the city was the focus of a major British counterattack. Arras saw an Allied counterattack against the flank of the German army. The German forces were pushing north towards the channel coast, in order to entrap the Allied Forces that were advancing east into Belgium. The counterattack at Arras was an Allied attempt to cut through the German spearhead and frustrate the German advance. Although the Allies initially made gains, they were repulsed by German forces and forced to withdraw to avoid encirclement. Arras was then occupied by the Germans and over the years 1941-44 218 French Resistance members were executed in ditches around the Arras citadel. On 3 September 1944, the city was entered and liberated by the British Guards Armoured Division.

===Contemporary period===

====Recent cooperative agreement====
In September 1993, Ipswich, England and Arras became twin towns, and a square in the new Ipswich Buttermarket development was named Arras Square to mark the relationship.

==Geography==


===Location and area===
Arras is located in northern France in the Hauts-de-France region. Hauts-de-France is divided into five departments: Nord, Pas-de-Calais, Somme, Oise, and Aisne. Arras is in the south-east part of the Pas-de-Calais department and forms the Arras district (&quot;arrondissement d&#x27;Arras&quot;) in the Artois, a former province of northern France.

By car, it is north of Paris, east of the English Channel, south of Brussels, and south of Amsterdam.

The city&#x27;s total area is . The lowest point in the city is at above sea level and the highest is at .

===Geology===
The soil of Arras is primarily composed of chalk, a soft, white, porous sedimentary rock that formed what is called the European stratigraphic unit. That Chalk Group deposited during the Late Cretaceous period 90 million years ago. It used to be extracted to construct the most prestigious buildings and houses of Arras. As a result, residents once nicknamed the city &quot;La ville blanche&quot; (the White Town). The Arras area soil is also composed of clay, which was used to produce bricks, build less noble buildings, and embellish façades. Clay is mostly found in the &quot;lieu-dit&quot; of &quot;La Terre Potier&quot; in the western part of the city.

The level of earthquake hazard in the Arras area is low, as it is in the whole Pas-de-Calais department.

===Hydrography===
Two rivers flow through Arras: the Scarpe and the Crinchon; both are left tributaries of the long Scheldt river (&quot;L&#x27;Escaut&quot; in French). The Crinchon is a rather small river of flowing through Arras underground, while the Scarpe is long, of which two-thirds has been turned into canals.

The source of the Scarpe is at Berles-Monchel near Aubigny-en-Artois. It flows through the cities of Arras, Douai and Saint-Amand-les-Eaux. The river ends at Mortagne-du-Nord where it flows into the Scheldt.

===Climate===
Arras mainly has a Western European oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb) affected by the North Atlantic Current as it is close to the English Channel (&quot;La Manche&quot; in French). There is frequent rain in all seasons, and temperatures throughout the year are mild, as it is near the sea. Temperature variations tend to be moderate; but there are some brief cold spells as it is subject to both oceanic and continental influences. So the climate can also be referred as semi-oceanic (known as a &quot;Climat océanique dégradé&quot; in French).

Summer days are usually moderately warm and agreeable, with temperatures between , occasionally rising above , with a fair amount of sunshine. Some years have even witnessed some unusual long periods of harsh summer weather, such as the heat wave of 2003 where temperatures exceeded for weeks, reaching on some days and rarely even cooling down at night. Spring and Fall have rather warm days and fresh nights, but remain quite unstable. Winter days are cold but generally above freezing, at around ; sunshine is usually scarce. Light night frosts are common as the temperature often falls below . Snowfall has been rare in the past decade but happens in some winters, such as 2009–10, with unusually cold weather: much of Europe had heavy snowfall and record-low temperatures. The most recent warmest winters recorded were in 1989–90, 1994–95, 2006–07 and 2013–14. The Arras region (and most of Northern Europe) had remarkably warm and sunny weather in the winter of 2013–14.

Rain falls throughout the year. Average annual precipitation is with light rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year. The highest recorded temperature was , and the lowest was .

On 28 October 2013, &quot;Cyclone Christian&quot; (also known as the St. Jude storm), one of the strongest extra-tropical cyclones ever recorded, hit Northern Europe including the Arras area. The cyclone&#x27;s central pressure was 981 mb, and wind speeds reached a maximum of . The city of Arras did not experience any major damage.

== Population and society ==



===Demographics===
, the population of Arras is 41,694 for a density of 3,585 people per square kilometre. The residents go by the name of &quot;Arrageois&quot; (male) and &quot;Arrageoise&quot; (female). The population is rather young as the highest number of residents is 15-29 of age. The most recent male to female ratio is 100:109, and the female to male ratio is 100:92 (2019). There are 19,947 males (48%) for 21,747 females (52%). The Arras functional area has a population of 158,499.

=== Religion ===
Arras&#x27;s Basilique-Cathédrale Notre-Dame et Saint-Vaast is the cathedral, a minor basilica, episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arras.

===Education===
Arras is part of the &quot;académie de Lille&quot; (Lille&#x27;s School District). There are 11 &quot;écoles maternelles&quot; (nursery schools), 11 &quot;écoles primaires&quot; (elementary schools), 8 &quot;collèges&quot; (junior high schools), and 7 &quot;lycées&quot; (high schools) within the city.
== Sights and attractions ==

===Squares===
The city centre is marked by two large squares, &quot;La Grand&#x27; Place&quot; and &quot;La Place des Héros&quot;, also called &quot;La Petite Place&quot;. The two squares are surrounded by a unique architectural ensemble of 155 Flemish-Baroque-style townhouses. These were built in the 17th and 18th century and were initially made of wood. In 1918, after the end of World War I, most of the townhouses were so severely damaged that they had to be restored to their pre-war conditions. They are now made of bricks.

===Town hall and belfry===
The Hôtel de Ville in Arras and its belfry were constructed in the early 16th century and had to be rebuilt in a slightly less grandiose style after World War I. The belfry is high and used to serve as a watchtower. Nowadays tourists can enjoy ascending the belfry. In 2005, the belfry was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site because of its architecture and historical importance in maintaining municipal power in Europe.

===Cathedral of Arras===
The original cathedral was constructed between 1030 and 1396. This Gothic structure was destroyed during the French Revolution and rebuilt in the 19th century. The present Basilique-Cathédrale Notre-Dame et Saint-Vaast is a minor basilica.

===The Boves===
The Boves, a well-preserved underground network of tunnels, beneath the city, was built in the 10th century and can now be visited by tourists. The idea was to set up a vast underground network to make all inhabitants&#x27; cellars interconnect by means of tunnels. Excavation material (chalk) was not wasted but rather used to construct houses. During World War I and World War II, the Boves was utilized as an underground bunker to hide and protect residents and valued objects from falling bombs.

===Art District===
The Art District is renowned for its Italian-style theatre hall built in 1785 and the &quot;Hôtel de Guînes&quot;, a private 18th-century townhouse that attracts artists, designers and producers of intimist shows.

===Abbey District===
Many of Arras&#x27;s most remarkable structures, including the Musée des beaux-arts d&#x27;Arras and several government buildings, occupy the site of the old Abbey of St. Vaast. The abbey&#x27;s church was demolished and rebuilt in fashionable classical style in 1833, and now serves as the town&#x27;s cathedral. The design was chosen by the one-time Abbot of St Vaast, the Cardinal de Rohan, and is stark in its simplicity, employing a vast number of perpendicular angles. There is a fine collection of statuary within the church and it houses a number of religious relics.

=== Vauban Citadel ===
Built by Vauban between 1667 and 1672, the Citadel has been nicknamed &quot;La belle inutile&quot; (the beautiful useless one) by residents as it has never been directly involved in heavy fighting and didn&#x27;t prevent the Germans from occupying the city in either World War. Since 7 July 2008 it has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites &quot;Fortifications of Vauban&quot; which includes eleven other fortifications.
Within the citadel on the side of &quot;La Place de Manœuvre&quot; a small Baroque-style chapel was built. Outside, &quot;Le Mur des Fusillés&quot; (the wall of the people executed by a firing squad) pays tribute to the 218 members of the French Resistance shot in the citadel&#x27;s ditch during World War II.

===Seasonal events===
Arras holds the biggest Christmas market north of Paris every year from the end of November to the end of December. Around 80 exhibitors offer a wide selection of arts and crafts, as well as local delicacies like chocolate rats, Atrébate beer and Cœurs d&#x27;Arras – heart-shaped biscuits which come in two flavours, ginger, and cheese. Entertainment includes cooking lessons with chefs, craft demonstrations, a merry-go-round, a ferris wheel, an ice-skating rink, and heated shelters. It also offers native products from International locations such as Canada, Vietnam, Morocco, Indonesia, Africa, and gourmet regional specialities from different parts of France: Auvergne, Savoie, South-Western France, and Nord-Pas-de-Calais.

The Main Square Festival is held for several days in early July within the Vauban Citadel, attracting tens of thousands of attendees and playing host to major acts such as The Chemical Brothers, Coldplay, Imagine Dragons, David Guetta, and The Black Eyed Peas.

The Arras Film Festival is a film festival held for ten days in November.

&quot;Le Jardin botanique Floralpina&quot; is a private botanical garden, specializing in alpine plants. It opens every year on the last Sunday of May and can be visited by appointment.

===UNESCO recognition===
Two buildings in Arras are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites:
* The Belfry of the Town Hall, as part of the &quot;Belfries of Belgium and France&quot; group, since 2005
* The Vauban citadel, as part of the &quot;Fortifications of Vauban&quot; group, since 2008

===Outside Arras===
The Vimy Memorial is a memorial just north of the town honouring a major World War I battle, the Battle of Vimy Ridge, which marked the first time Canada fielded an entire army of her own. Four Canadian divisions fought there on Easter weekend 1917. The Battle of Vimy Ridge was part of the broader Allied offensive in April known as the Battle of Arras. The Canadian National Vimy Memorial is nearby. Vimy was the only victory the Allies would enjoy during their 1917 spring offensive. The Basilica of Notre Dame de Lorette cemetery, overlooking the nearby village of Ablain-Saint-Nazaire, likewise stands before one of France&#x27;s largest World War I necropolises. Part of an extensive network of tunnels dug in World War I by British Empire soldiers can be visited at the Carrière Wellington museum in the suburbs.

<text>Robert Emmet (4 March 177820 September 1803) was an Irish Republican, orator and rebel leader. Following the suppression of the United Irish uprising in 1798, he sought to organise a renewed attempt to overthrow the British Crown and Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland, and to establish a nationally representative government. Emmet entertained, but ultimately abandoned, hopes of immediate French assistance and of coordination with radical militants in Great Britain. In Ireland, many of the surviving veterans of &#x27;98 hesitated to lend their support, and his rising in Dublin in 1803 proved abortive.

Emmet’s Proclamation of the Provisional Government to the People of Ireland, his Speech from the Dock, and his &quot;sacrificial&quot; end on the gallows inspired later generations of Irish republicans. His memory was invoked by Patrick Pearse who in 1916 was again to proclaim a provisional government in Dublin.

==Early life==
Emmet was born at 109 St. Stephen&#x27;s Green, in Dublin on 4 March 1778. He was the youngest son of Dr Robert Emmet (1729–1802), physician to the Lord Lieutenant, and his wife, Elizabeth Mason (1739–1803). The Emmets were financially comfortable, members of the Protestant Ascendancy with a house at St Stephen&#x27;s Green and a country residence near Milltown.

Dr Emmet supported the cause of American independence and was a well-known figure on the fringes of the Irish patriot movement. Theobald Wolfe Tone, a friend of Emmet&#x27;s elder brother, Thomas Addis Emmet, and an advocate of more radical reform, including Catholic Emancipation, was a visitor to the house. So too, as a friend of his father, was Dr William Drennan, the original proposer of the &quot;benevolent conspiracy--a plot for the people&quot; that was to call itself, at Tone&#x27;s suggestion, the Society of United Irishmen.

Robert Emmet was educated first at Oswald&#x27;s School in Dapping Court, near Golden Lane, and then at the ‘English grammar school’ of Samuel Whyte (qv) at 75 Grafton Street, a well-reputed school attended by the children of Dublin notables; here he learned oratory, fencing, astronomy, music, etc. One of his schoolmates was the poet and national bard Thomas Moore; Arthur Wellesley was a pupil a few years earlier. After this he was tutored by the Rev Mr Lewis of Camden Street.

Emmet entered Trinity College Dublin in October 1793 as a precocious fifteen-year-old and excelled as a student of history and chemistry. In December 1797 he joined the College Historical Society. His brother Thomas and Wolfe Tone, preceding him in the society, had maintained its lively tradition (stretching back to Edmund Burke) of defying the College&#x27;s injunction against discussing questions of &quot;modern politics&quot;.

Fellow Society member Thomas Moore recalled that men &quot;of advanced standing and reputation for oratory, came to attend our debates, expressly for the purpose of answering [Robert] Emmet&quot;. His eloquence was unmatched. In the preface to his &quot;Irish Melodies&quot; (1837), he recounts Emmet &quot;ardently&quot; taking the side of Democracy in the debate &quot;Whether an Aristocracy or a Democracy is most favourable to the advancement of science and literature?&quot; and, in &quot;another of his remarkable speeches&quot;, saying, &quot;When a people, advancing rapidly in knowledge and power, perceive at last how far their government is lagging behind them, what then, I ask, is to be done in such a case? What, but to pull the government &quot;up&quot; to the people?&quot;

Robert Emmet is described by his contemporaries as slight in person; his features were regular, his forehead high, his eyes bright and full of expression, his nose sharp, thin, and straight, the lower part of his face slightly pock-marked, his complexion sallow.

==Revolutionary career==
===Emissary for the new United Irish Executive===
In April 1798, Emmet was exposed as the secretary of a secret college committee in support of the Society of United Irishmen (of which his brother and Tone were leading executive members). Rather than submit to questioning under oath that might inculpate others, he withdrew from Trinity.

Emmet did not participate in the disordered United Irish uprising when it broke out in counties to the south and north of a heavily-garrisoned Dublin in May 1798. But after the suppression of the rebellion in the summer, and in communication with state prisoners held at Fort George in Scotland (including his brother), Emmet joined William Putnam McCabe in re-establishing a United Irish organisation. They sought to reconstruct the Society on a strict military basis, with its members chosen personally by its officers&#x27; meeting as the executive directorate. Following the example not only of Tone but also of James Coigly, their aim was to again solicit a French invasion on the prospective strength both of a rising in Ireland and of a radical conspiracy in Britain. To this end McCabe set out for France in December 1798, stopping first in London to renew contact with the network of English Jacobins, the United Britons.

On the new United Irish executive in Dublin, Emmet assisted veterans Thomas Wright (from April 1799, an informer) and Malachy Delaney (a former officer in the Austrian army), with a manual on insurgent tactics. In the summer of 1800, as secretary to Delaney, he set out on a secret mission to support McCabe&#x27;s efforts in Paris. Through his foreign minister Talleyrand, Emmet and Delaney presented Napoleon with a memorial which argued that the parliamentary Union with Great Britain, imposed in the wake of the rebellion, had &quot;in no way eased the discontent of Ireland&quot;, and with lessons drawn from the failure of &#x27;98, the United Irish were again prepared to act on the first news of a French landing.

Their request for an invasion force almost double that commanded by Hoche in the aborted 1796 Bantry expedition possibly told against them. The First Consul had other priorities: securing a temporary respite from war (the treaties of Lunéville in 1801 and of Amiens, March 1802) and re-enslaving Haiti.

===Connection with English radicals and with France===
In January 1802 the arrival in Dublin of William Dowdall, following his release from Fort George, injected new life into the United Irishmen, and by March, contact was re-established with the United Britons network in England. In July, McCabe, returning to Paris from a visit to Dublin, brought news to Manchester that the United Irishmen were ready to rise again as soon as the continental war was renewed. In this expectation, preparations in England were intensified, including in London where Edward Despard sought to enlist in the republican conspiracy soldiers of the guards&#x27; regiment stationed at Windsor and the Tower of London. In October, Emmet (one of the few in exile against whom charges were not pending in Ireland) was dispatched from Paris to assist Dowdall with the Dublin preparations.

In November 1802 the government moved on the conspirators in London. It did not discover the full extent of the plot, but the arrest of Despard and his execution in February 1803 may have weakened English support. Emmet&#x27;s emissaries from Dublin found a cooler reception in London and the mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire than they had expected.

In May 1803 the war with France was renewed. McCabe appeared to enjoy Napoleon&#x27;s favour, and had had assurances of his intention to help Ireland secure her independence. From his own interviews with Napoleon, and with Talleyrand, in the autumn of 1802, Emmet emerged unconvinced. He was persuaded that the First Consul was considering a Channel crossing for August 1803, but that in the contest with England there would be scant consideration for Ireland&#x27;s interests. (Sympathetic to the cause, Denis Taaffe proposed that if ever France took possession of Ireland she would trade it for a West Indian sugar island).

Disputing with Arthur O&#x27;Connor, who in Paris insisted on a guarantee of a French landing, when war was resumed Emmet sent his own emissary, Patrick Gallagher, to Paris, to ask for &quot;money, arms, ammunition and officers&quot; but not for large numbers of troops. After the rising in Dublin misfired, and with no further prospects at home, in August Emmet did send Myles Byrne to Paris to do all he could to encourage an invasion. But at his trial, while he conceded that a &quot;connection with France was, indeed, intended&quot; it was to be &quot;only as far as mutual interest would sanction require&quot;: no man should &quot;calumniate&quot; his memory by believing that he had &quot;hoped for freedom from the government of France&quot;.

Michael Fayne, a Kildare conspirator, later testified that Emmet used talk of French assistance only to &quot;encourage the lower orders of people&quot;, as he often heard him say that as bad as an English government was, it was better than a French one&quot;, and that his object was &quot;an independent state brought about by Irishmen only&quot;.

===Decision to proceed with a rising in Dublin===
After his return to Ireland in October 1802, assisted by Anne Devlin (ostensibly his housekeeper), and with a legacy of £2,000 left to him by his father, Emmet laid preparations for a rising. According to the later recollection of Myles Byrne, on St Patrick&#x27;s Day, 17 March 1803, Emmet gave a stirring speech to his confederates justifying the renewed resort to arms. If Ireland had cause in 1798, he argued it had only been compounded by the legislative union with Britain. As long as Ireland retained in its own parliament a &quot;vestige of self-government&quot;, its people might entertain the hope of representation and reform. But now &quot;in consequence of the accursed union&quot;: [S]even-eights of the population have no right to send a member of their body to represent them, even in a foreign parliament, and the other eight part of the population are the tools and taskmasters, acting for the cruel English government and their Irish Ascendancy--a monster still worse, if possible than foreign tyranny.In April 1803, James (Jemmy) Hope and Myles Byrne arranged conferences, at which Emmet promised arms, with Michael Dwyer (Devlin’s cousin), who still maintained a guerrilla resistance in the Wicklow Mountains, and with Thomas Cloney, a veteran of the Wexford rebellion in &#x27;98. Hope and Russell headed north to rouse the United veterans of Down and Antrim.

In Dublin, Emmet believed his hand was forced on the 16th of July when gunpowder in the rebel arms depot in Patrick Street accidentally detonated, arousing the suspicion of the authorities. He persuaded the majority of the leadership to bring forward the date for the rising to the evening of Saturday, July 23, a festival day, which would provide cover for the gathering of their forces. The plan, without any further consideration of French aid, was to storm Dublin Castle, make hostage of Privy Council, and signal the country to rise.

=== Moved by &quot;a sinister hand&quot;? ===
As preparations were made early in July, according to one of his many biographers, Helen Landreth, Emmet believed that &quot;he had been tricked into the conspiracy&quot;, that he had been &quot;a pawn moved by some sinister hand&quot;. Such may have been the suggestion of Hope&#x27;s later remarks to the historian R. R. Madden. Emmet, according to Hope, realised that &quot;the men of rank and fortune&quot; who had urged him to head a new rising had had ulterior motives, but that, with Russell, he nonetheless placed his confidence in the great mass of the people to rise. This would have been despite Emmet&#x27;s recognition that: &quot;No leading Catholic is committed. We are all Protestants&quot;.

Parts of his plan were known, through spies and informers, to an undersecretary at Dublin Castle, Alexander Marsden and in turn by the Chief Secretary for Ireland, William Wickham. Yet they kept reports from the Lord Lieutenant and stayed the hand of the Town Major, Henry Sirr, who had wished to move against the rebels following the St. Patrick Street explosion.

Drawing on research in the 1880s by Dr Thomas Addis Emmet of New York City, a grandson of Emmet&#x27;s elder brother, Landreth believes that Marsden and Wickham conspired with William Pitt, then out of office but anticipating his return as Prime Minister, to encourage the most dangerously disaffected in Ireland to fatally compromise the prospects for an effective revolt by acting in advance of a French invasion. Landreth believes that Emmet was their unwitting instrument, drawn home from Paris for the purpose of organising a premature rising by the calculated misrepresentations of William Putnam McCabe and Arthur O&#x27;Connor. Her evidence, however, is circumstantial, relying not least on Pitt&#x27;s reputed cynicism in accepting the prospect of a rebellion in 1798 in order to frighten the Irish Parliament into dissolving itself.

Emmet biographer, Patrick Geoghegan, finds it entirely &quot;implausible&quot; that Pitt, in or out of office, would risk the credibility of the union he had accomplished, and perhaps much else, for &quot;some negligible security gains&quot;. He argues that Wickham was genuinely complacent and notes that, while he may have too long delayed moving against the rebels in the hope of discovering the full scope of their conspiracy, on the 23rd Marsden did sound the alarm in advance of the day&#x27;s action. Madden, however, did suggest that the Orange-Ascendancy faction around Marsden, alarmed by Pitt&#x27;s attempt to include Catholic emancipation in the Acts of Union, had hopes that insurrectionary attempt would harden British policy.

=== Proclamation of the Provisional Government ===
Emmet issued a proclamation in the name of the &quot;Provisional Government&quot;. Calling upon the Irish people &quot;to show the world that you are competent to take your place among the nations . . . as an independent country&quot;, Emmet made clear in the proclamation that they would have to do so &quot;without foreign assistance&quot;: &quot;That confidence which was once lost by trusting to external support . . . has been again restored. We have been mutually pledged to each other to look only to our own strength&quot;.

The Proclamation also contained &quot;allusions to the widening of the political agenda of Emmet and the United Irishmen following the failure of 1798&quot;. In addition to democratic parliamentary reform, the Proclamation announced that tithes were to be abolished and the land of the established Church of Ireland nationalised. This, it has been suggested, marked the influence upon Emmet of Thomas Russell, although as a radical campaigner for economic and social reform, Russell might have wished to go further. Emmet remained intent on giving the rising a universal appeal across both class and sectarian divisions: &quot;We are not against property – we war against no religious sect – we war not against past opinions or prejudices – we war against English dominion.&quot;

The Government sought to suppress all 10,000 printed copies of the Proclamation. Only two are known to survive.

===The Rising===
At 11 on the morning of 23 July 1803, Emmet showed men from Kildare an arsenal of pikes, grenades, rockets, and gunpowder-packed hollowed beams (these were to be dragged out onto the streets to prevent cavalry charges). They noted only the absence of recognisable firearms and were unimpressed by Emmet, a &quot;youngster&quot; whose inexperience would place &quot;the rope around the neck of decent men&quot;. They left to turn back other Kildare insurgents on the road to Dublin. The plan to surprise Dublin Castle, and seize the viceroy, was botched when the assailants prematurely revealed themselves.

By evening Emmet, Malachy Delaney and Myles Byrne (turned out for the occasion in gold-trimmed green uniforms) were outside their Thomas Street arsenal – with just 80 men. R.R. Madden describes &quot;a motley assemblage of armed men, a great number of whom were, if not intoxicated, under the evident excitement of drink&quot;. Unaware that John Allen was approaching with a band, according to one witness, of 300, and shaken by the sight of a lone dragoon being pulled from his horse and piked to death, Emmet told the men to disperse. He had already stood down sizeable insurgent groups straddling the main suburban roads by pre-arranged signal, a solitary rocket.

Sporadic clashes continued into the night. In one incident, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Lord Kilwarden, was dragged from his carriage and stabbed by pikes. Found still alive, he was taken to a watch-house where he died shortly thereafter. Kilwarden had used his position to help his cousin, Wolfe Tone, to avoid prosecution in 1794. He was nonetheless reviled for the prosecution and hanging of William Orr in 1797 and, in the wake of 1798, of several Catholic Defenders. Kilwarden&#x27;s nephew, the Rev. Mr Wolfe, was also killed, although his daughter was not harmed.

Emmet fled the city arriving in Rathfarnham with a party of 16 men. When he heard that Wicklowmen were still planning to rise, he issued a countermanding order to prevent needless violence. Instead he ordered Byrne to Paris to again solicit the French.

==Capture, trial, and execution==

While Emmet hid in Rathfarnham, yeomen sought to extract information from Anne Devlin, prodding her with bayonets and half hanging her until she passed out. Had he not insisted on taking his leave of his fiancée Sarah Curran (daughter of the disapproving John Philpot Curran) he may have succeeded in joining Dowdall and Byrne in France. Emmet was captured on 25 August and taken to the Castle, then removed to Kilmainham. Vigorous but ineffectual efforts were made to procure his escape.
Emmet was tried and convicted for high treason on 19 September. The evidence against him had been overwhelming, but the Crown took the extra precaution of suborning his defence attorney, Leonard McNally, for £200 and a pension. McNally&#x27;s assistant Peter Burrowes could not be bought and represented Emmet as best he could.

Emmet&#x27;s instruction, however, was not to offer a defence: he would not call any witnesses, &quot;or to take up the time of the court&quot;. When on announcing this, McNally proposed that the trial was concluded, the prosecuting counsel William Plunket took to his feet. In what was widely regarded as an unnecessary attack on a doomed man, Plunket, who was to see himself appointed Solicitor-General, mocked Emmet as the deluded leader of a conspiracy encompassing &quot;the bricklayer, the old clothes man, the hodman and the hostler&quot;.

Emmet&#x27;s &quot;&quot; is especially remembered for his closing remarks. Historian Patrick Geoghehan has identified over seventy different versions of the text, but in an early printing (1818) based on notes taken by Burrowes, Emmet concludes:

I am here ready to die. I am not allowed to vindicate my character; no man shall dare to vindicate my character; and when I am prevented from vindicating myself, let no man dare to calumniate me. Let my character and my motives repose in obscurity and peace, till other times and other men can do them justice. Then shall my character be vindicated; then may my epitaph be written.Chief Justice Lord Norbury sentenced Emmet to be hanged, drawn and quartered, as was customary for conviction of treason. The following day, 20 September, Emmet was executed in Thomas Street in front of St. Catherine&#x27;s. He was hanged and then beheaded once dead. As family members and friends of Robert had also been arrested, including some who had nothing to do with the rebellion, no one came forward to claim his remains out of fear of arrest.

On the eve of his execution, Emmet wrote from Kilmainham to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, William Wickham, whose &quot;fairness&quot; he acknowledged. He appears to have made a profound impression.

In December Wickham resigned his post, confessing to friends that &quot;no consideration upon earth&quot; could induce him &quot;to remain after having maturely reflected&quot; on the contents of the note he had received. He could not enforce laws &quot;unjust, oppressive and unchristian&quot; and intolerable to the memory of a man he had been &quot;compelled by the duty of my office to pursue to the death&quot;. Wickham was persuaded that Emmet had been attempting to save Ireland from &quot;a state of depression and humiliation&quot; and that, had he himself been an Irishman, he &quot;should most unquestionably have joined him&quot;.

==Burial and Shelley&#x27;s later eulogy==
Emmet&#x27;s remains were first delivered to Newgate Prison and then back to Kilmainham Gaol, where the jailer was under instructions that if no one claimed them they were to be buried in a nearby hospital&#x27;s burial grounds called Bully&#x27;s Acre. Family tradition has it that in 1804, under cover of the burial of his sister, Mary Anne Holmes, Emmet&#x27;s remains were removed from Bully&#x27;s Acre and re-interred in the family vault (since demolished) at St Peter&#x27;s Church in Aungier Street.

After searching for Emmet&#x27;s grave in Dublin, early in 1812, Percy Bysshe Shelley revised his elegiac poem “The Monarch&#x27;s Funeral: An Anticipation”: &quot;For who was he, the uncoffined slain, /That fell in Erin&#x27;s injured isle /Because his spirit dared disdain/ To light his country&#x27;s funeral pile?&quot; In &quot;On Robert Emmet&#x27;s Grave&quot; Shelley proposed that, because unknown, Emmet&#x27;s grave would &quot;remain unpolluted by fame &quot;/&quot;Till thy foes, by the world and by fortune caressed, /Shall pass like a mist from the light of thy name.&quot;&quot;&quot;

When Shelley returned to London from Dublin in 1812, it was with an account of Emmet&#x27;s trial containing his famous speech, and Emmet appears again as the “patriot” in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Walk,&quot; a lengthy broadside against a corrupt and un-reforming government. (At the same time, while in Dublin, Shelley had gone round streets and pubs of the city handing out &quot;An Address, to the Irish People,&quot; a 22-page pamphlet in which he pleaded with the Irish people not to repeat Emmet&#x27;s attempt: &quot;I do not wish to see things changed now, because it cannot be done without violence, and we may assure ourselves that none of us are fit for any change, however good, if we condescend to employ force in a cause we think right&quot;).

A search of the family vault at St Peter&#x27;s Church in 1903 could not find Emmet&#x27;s remains, and his actual burial place is still unknown, inspiring the phrase, &quot;Do not look for him. His grave is Ireland.&quot;

==Legacy==

Emmet’s rebellion infuriated Lord Castlereagh because he &quot;could not see the change that his own great measure the Union has effected in Ireland&quot;. Despite having so badly misfired, the 1803 rising suggested that the Act of Union was not going to be the palliative Castlereagh and Prime Minister William Pitt had intended. Castlereagh advised that &quot;the best thing would be to go into no detail whatever upon the case, to keep the subject clearly standing on its own narrow base of a contemptible insurrection without means or respectable leaders&quot;, an instruction Plunket appears to have followed in Emmet&#x27;s prosecution. This was to be a stance taken not only by unionists.

Daniel O&#x27;Connell who was to lead the struggle for Catholic Emancipation and for repeal of the Union in the decades following Emmet&#x27;s death, roundly condemned the resort to &quot;physical force&quot;. O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s own programme of mobilising public opinion, fuelled by sometimes violent rhetoric and demonstrated in &quot;monster meetings&quot;, might have suggested that constitutionalism and physical force were complementary rather than antithetical. But O&#x27;Connell remained content with his dismissal of Emmet in 1803 as an instigator of bloodshed who had forfeited any claim to &quot;compassion&quot;.

Emmet&#x27;s political rehabilitation begins in the Famine-years of the 1840s with the Young Irelanders. In 1846 they had finally broken with O&#x27;Connell declaring that if Repeal could not be carried by moral persuasion and peaceful means, a resort to arms would be &quot;a no less honourable course&quot;. The Young Irelander publisher Charles Gavan Duffy repeatedly reprinted Michael James Whitty&#x27;s popular chapbook &quot;Life, Trial and Conversations of Robert Emmet Esq.&quot; (1836), and promoted R.R. Madden&#x27;s &quot;Life and Times of Robert Emmet&quot; (1847) which, despite its devastating account of the Thomas Street fiasco, was hagiographic.

In carrying forward the tradition of physical-force republicanism from the debacle of the Young Irelander &quot;Famine Rebellion&quot; in 1848, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (the Fenians) also carried forward admiration for Emmet. On the $20 bonds they issued in 1866 in the United States in the name of the Irish Republic, his profile appears opposite that of Tone.

Robert Emmet&#x27;s older brother, Thomas Addis Emmet emigrated to the United States shortly after Robert&#x27;s execution. He eventually served as the New York State Attorney General. His descendants (who included the prominent American portrait painters Lydia Field Emmet, Rosina Emmet Sherwood, Ellen Emmet Rand, and Jane Emmet de Glehn) helped advance his standing among the Irish diaspora, which in turn may have been one factor in ensuring that he was one among the &quot;ghosts&quot; invoked in the run-up to 1916 Easter Rising.

In the Emmet Commemoration speech he delivered in New York City in March 1914, Pearse described how the spirit of Irish patriotism called in Emmet &quot;to a dreamer&quot; and &quot;awoke a man of action&quot;; called to &quot;a student and a recluse&quot; and brought forth &quot;a leader of men&quot;; &quot;called to one who loved the ways of peace&quot; and found &quot;a revolutionary&quot;. Emmet was a man unwilling to &quot;surrender of one jot or shred of our claim to freedom even in return for all the blessings of the British peace&quot;. His attempt in 1803 was to be regarded, not as a failure but as &quot;a triumph for that deathless thing we call Irish Nationality&quot;.

As Pearse parleyed with the British for terms at the end of Easter week, 1916, his Dublin commander James Connolly is recalled lying wounded in a house in Moore Street with a portrait of Emmet hanging over his bed. 

==Representation in popular culture==

In a speech on Emmet in New York City in 1904, W. B. Yeats famously observed that &quot;Emmet died and became an image&quot;. This was the work first, and foremost, of Thomas Moore. In his popular ballad &quot;O! Breathe Not His Name&quot;, Moore made his former Trinity College friend the touchstone of national sentiment: &quot;Oh breathe not his name! let it sleep in the shade, / Where cold and unhonoured his relics are laid! [...] / And the tear we shed, though secret it rolls, Shall keep his memory green in our souls&quot;. Dwelling upon the heartache of Sarah Curran, his &quot;She is Far From the Land Where Her Young Hero Sleeps&quot; also made Emmet an icon of romantic love.

In Irish America where, together with Emmet&#x27;s Speech from the Dock, &quot;O! Breathe Not His Name&quot; became part of the canon of parochial education, Moore had innumerable imitators. Of these, one of the most ambitious was John Boyle O&#x27;Reilly, a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood who had escaped from penal servitude in Western Australia. O&#x27;Reilly wrote a publicly performed eighty-four line poem, &quot;The Patriot&#x27;s Grave&quot; (1878) in which he both echoes the defiance of Emmet&#x27;s last words while attempting to bring the defence of physical force within a broader tradition that embraced constitutional agitation (to add Emmet to a Pantheon that included &quot;Grattan, Flood and Curran&quot;). Emmet was also a frequent character on the patriotic stage. Typical of his green-uniform presentation was Brandon Tynon&#x27;s melodrama, &quot;Robert Emmet, the Days of 1803&quot;, which premiered on Broadway in 1902.

In the nineteenth century, the Emmet story also found its way into prose. On both sides of the Atlantic John Doherty&#x27;s 1836 &quot;Life, Trial and Conversation and Times of Robert Emmet&quot;, and R. R. Madden&#x27;s 1844 &quot;Life and Time of Robert Emmet&quot; became the standard references. With less patience for historical or political background, what tended to be drawn out in subsequent works was the notion of &quot;pure sacrifice&quot;. In &quot;Robert Emmet, A Survey of his Rebellion and of His Romance&quot; (1904), Louise Imogen Guiney classes Emmet with Charlotte Corday and John Brown.

In the early twentieth century, Moore&#x27;s Emmet appeared in pioneering film. While focusing on the Emmet-Curran love story, the 1911Thanhouser film (USA) &quot;Robert Emmet&quot; depicts Emmet&#x27;s expulsion from Trinity College, his meeting with Napoleon, his part in the rising and his capture, trial and execution. Some of the same storyline features in &quot;Ireland a Nation&quot; (1914) written and produced in London and Ireland by Walter MacNamara, and Sidney Olcott&#x27;s &quot;Bold Emmett Ireland&#x27;s Martyr&quot; (1915, Sid Films, USA).

Many decades later there was a step away from hagiography. In her screen drama &quot;Anne Devlin&quot; (1984), the Irish feminist filmmaker Pat Murphy offers an implicit criticism of patriotic politics that operates &quot;largely at the level of signs and representations&quot;. In one scene, Emmet enters a room as Devlin is holding up his splendid green uniform in front of a mirror. Asked what she thinks of it, Devlin (cousin of the guerrilla leader Michael Dwyer) replies that it looks like a green version of an English Redcoat, and will be seen &quot;a mile off&quot;. &quot;We should&quot;, she argues, &quot;be rebel as ourselves’&quot;.

Emmet is &quot;bold Robert&quot; in the song &quot;Back Home in Derry&quot;, written by Bobby Sands in HM Prison Maze before his fatal hunger strike in 1981. The lyrics, describing the feelings of rebels convicts as leave Ireland for Australia, were recorded by Christy Moore.

==Honours==
Places named after Emmet in the United States include Emmetsburg, Iowa; Emmet, Nebraska; Emmet County, Iowa; Emmett, Michigan and Emmet County, Michigan, and Emmet Street in the historic French neighborhood of Soulard, St. Louis. The Robert Emmet Elementary School in Chicago, Illinois was named for him. Two time All Ireland Club Camogie Champions Robert Emmet&#x27;s GAC Slaughtneil is named after him. Emmet Park in Savannah, Georgia, was named after Emmet in 1902 in preparation for the centennial of his death.

Statues were erected in his honour:
* A life-size bronze statue of Robert Emmet by Jerome Connor stands in St Stephen&#x27;s Green, Dublin, the parkland beside which Emmet was born. A copy stands in Emmetsburg, Iowa.
* A bronze statue of Emmet by Jerome Connor stands in Washington, DC on Embassy Row (Massachusetts Avenue NW and S Street NW). A public commemoration of Emmet&#x27;s execution and legacy is held annually on the fourth Sunday in September by the Irish American Unity Conference.

<doc id="105059" wikidata="Q40956" url="?curid=105059" title="Anhui">
<text>Anhui is an inland province located in East China. Its provincial capital and largest city is Hefei. The province is located across the basins of the Yangtze and Huai rivers, bordering Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the east, Jiangxi to the south, Hubei and Henan to the west, and Shandong to the north. With a population of 61 million, Anhui is the 9th most populous province in China. It is the 22nd largest Chinese province based on area, and the 12th most densely-populated region of all 34 Chinese provincial regions. Anhui&#x27;s population is mostly composed of Han Chinese. Languages spoken within the province include Lower Yangtze Mandarin, Wu, Hui, Gan and small portion of Central Plains Mandarin.

The name &quot;Anhui&quot; derives from the names of two cities: Anqing and Huizhou (now Huangshan City). The abbreviation for Anhui is , corresponding to the historical , and is also used to refer to the Wan River and Mount Tianzhu. The provincial government of Anhui includes a Governor, Provincial Congress, the People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, and the Provincial Higher People&#x27;s Court. Aside from managing local government departments, the Anhui provincial government manages 16 cities, 62 counties, 43 county-level districts and 1,522 townships. Anhui&#x27;s total GDP ranked 14th among China&#x27;s 31 province-level regions .

==History==

Anhui was established 1667, during the reign of the Qing dynasty&#x27;s Kangxi Emperor. The province&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Wan&quot;, is taken from the name of a small state that existed in the region during the Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The name &quot;Wan&quot; also corresponds to the province&#x27;s Mount Tianzhu and . Evidence of human beings inhabiting what is now Anhui 20,000 years before present has been attested by archaeological findings in Fanchang County, related to he cultural domains of Yangshao and Longshan, dated to the Neolithic period (8000–2000 BC). In relation to these cultures, archeologists have discovered through excavation a 4500-year-old city called the Nanchengzi Ruins in Guzhen County, after they discovered a Neolithic city wall and a moat that was part of a much larger and integrated city in the region during their 2013 disinterment.

There are many historical sites located in the province dating to the pre-imperial period. The culture of northern Anhui was associated with that of the North China Plain, together with what is now Henan, northern Jiangsu, and southern Shandong. Central Anhui was densely populated, and consisted of the fertile Huai River watershed. Contrastingly, southern Anhui was closer to Jiangxi and southern Jiangsu; the hills in the southeastern part of the province formed a unique cultural sphere. After the Qin dynasty unified China in 221 BC, the territory of modern Anhui belonged to different prefectures, including Jiujiang, Zhang, Tang, and Sishui. The lands became part of the Yang, Yu, and Xu prefectures during the Han dynasty (202 BC220 AD). During the Three Kingdoms era (222–280), Anhui was dominated at various times by Eastern Wu and Cao Wei. By the Song dynasty (960–1279), the economy and culture of area was flourishing. Anhui became part of the province of Henan during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368); during the Ming dynasty the area was directly administrated by the imperial capital in Nanjing.

Anhui and Jiangsu were merged into one province under the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) until 1666, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. It played an important role in the Self-Strengthening Movement led by Li Hongzhang during the later Qing; at this time, western weapons, factories and administrative theories were being introduced into China. Over the next 50 years, Anhui became one of the country&#x27;s most radically liberal areas, with important 20th-century figures moving to the province, like the poet and diplomat Hu Shih, and Chen Duxiu, the founder of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

In 1938, large areas in north and central Anhui were severely damaged by the decision of President Chiang Kai-shek to demolish a critical dam on the Yellow River, hoping that would physically impede the ongoing invasion by the Imperial Japanese Army and prevent them from capturing Zhengzhou. Within only ten days of the dam breaking, the water and sands drowned all of north and middle area of this province, resulting in the deaths of between 500,000 and 900,000 Chinese people, as well as an unknown number of Japanese soldiers. Following the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1945, the capital city of Anhui moved to Hefei, then a small town. The provincial government made significant investments for its development. After 1949, the government launched projects to repair the damages suffered during World War II. The province underwent significant development via the Third Front campaign to build basic and national defense industries in protected locations, in case of invasion by the Soviet Union or United States. The centerpiece of the Shanghai Small Third Front was the &quot;rear base&quot; in Anhui which served as &quot;a multi-function manufacturing base for anti-aircraft and anti-tank weaponry&quot;. During the late 1990s Anhui became one of China&#x27;s fastest-growing provinces. The province forms part of the China Yangtze River Delta Economic Area, which is the most developed area of China.

==Geography==

Anhui is topographically diverse. The north is part of the North China Plain while the north-central areas are part of the Huai River watershed. Both regions are flat, and densely populated. The land becomes more uneven further south, with the Dabie Mountains occupying much of southwestern Anhui and a series of hills and ranges cutting through southeastern Anhui, between which is the Yangtze River. The highest peak in Anhui is Lotus Peak, part of Huangshan in southeastern Anhui. It has an altitude of .

Major rivers include the Huai River in the north and the Yangtze in the south. The largest lake is Lake Chaohu situated in the center of the province, with an area of about . The southeastern part of the province near the Yangtze River has many lakes as well.

As with topography, the province differs in climate from north to south. The north is more temperate with more distinct seasons. January temperatures average at around −1 to 2 °C north of the Huai River, and 0 to 3 °C south of the Huai River; in July temperatures average 27 °C or above. Plum rains occur in June and July and may cause flooding.

Anhui has 16 cities. Economically, top 3 cities are, Hefei, Wuhu and Anqing.

*Hefei
*Wuhu
*Anqing
*Huangshan City
*Tongling
*Ma&#x27;anshan
*Huainan
*Bengbu
*Bozhou
== Ecology ==
The Anhui elm&quot;, Ulmus&quot; &quot;gaussenii&quot; , is a medium size deciduous tree whose natural range is restricted to the valleys of the Langya limestone mountains of Chu Xian. The tree was most commonly found on the flood plains, indicating a tolerance of periodic inundation. &quot;U. gaussenii&quot; is now the world&#x27;s rarest and most endangered elm species, with only approximately 30 trees known to survive in the wild in 2009.

The province is also home to the Chinese alligator (&quot;Alligator sinensis&quot;, ), also known as the Yangtze alligator, China alligator, or historically the muddy dragon, a critically endangered crocodilian.

==Administrative divisions==

Anhui is divided into sixteen prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities:

These 16 prefecture-level cities are in turn subdivided into 104 county-level divisions (45 districts, 9 county-level cities, and 50 counties). Those are in turn divided into 1,512 township-level divisions (997 towns, 230 townships, 9 ethnic townships, and 276 subdistricts).

===Urban areas===

==Government==

The Politics of Anhui Province is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The Governor of Anhui () is the highest-ranking official in the Anhui Provincial People&#x27;s Government. However, in the province&#x27;s dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Anhui Chinese Communist Party Provincial Committee Secretary (), colloquially termed the &quot;Anhui Party Chief&quot;.

Most provincial government departments and the Governor office are located at No.1 Zhongshan Road, moved from old downtown of Hefei since 2016. Provincial government is responsible to manage 16 prefecture-level cities, 105 counties, 1845 townships and different departments in Anhui. The Anhui Provincial People&#x27;s Congress is just located near provincial government. The Provincial Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is located at No.317, Suzhou Road. The Provincial Higher People&#x27;s Court is located at no. 472 Changjiang Rd.

Typically, annual provincial congress meeting is held in the first quarter of each year shortly before national congress meeting and the annual meeting of CPPCC is held in the first quarter or the fourth quarter of each year.

==Economy==
Agriculture in Anhui varies according to the climate zones. To the north of the Huai River, wheat and sweet potatoes are grown, while to the south it is rice and wheat instead. , Anhui&#x27;s nominal GDP was US$670 billion (CN¥ 4.51 trilion), about 3.72% of the country&#x27;s GDP and ranked 10th among province-level administrative units; the province&#x27;s primary, secondary and tertiary industries were worth CN¥351.37 billion (US$52.24 billion), CN¥1.8588 trillion (US$276.36 billion) and CN¥2.29433 trillion (US$341.1 billion) respectively. Its nominal GDP per capita was US$10,943 (CN¥73,603) and ranked the 14th in the country.

Natural resources of Anhui include iron in Ma&#x27;anshan, coal in Huainan, and copper in Tongling. There are industries related to these natural resources (e.g. steel industry at Ma&#x27;anshan). One of the famous Anhui-based corporations is the automobile company Chery, which is based in Wuhu.

Compared to its more prosperous neighbours to the east, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, Anhui has lagged markedly behind in economic development, with a GDP per capita around half of those two provinces in 2017 rapidly improved from 1/3 of those two provinces in 2010. However, the provincial GDP per capita is based on the population registered in the province (that is, with local Hukou), but not necessarily residing there. There is significant regional disparity, where much of the wealth is concentrated in industrial regions close to the Yangtze River, such as Hefei, Wuhu, and Ma&#x27;anshan. The province is home to a large cluster of white goods manufacture such as Haier, Hisense, Whirlpool, Gree, Royalstar, and Meling.

===Major economic and technological development zones===
====Hefei Economic and Technological Development Zone====
Hefei Economic and Technological Development Zone is located in the southwest of Hefei and was established in 1993. It is located close to Hefei Luogang International Airport.

====Hefei Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone====
Hefei Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was founded in October 1990 and approved by the State Council as a state-level Development Zone in March 1991. In 1997, the Development Zone was ratified as an APEC Science and Technology Industrial Park, with special open policies to APEC and EU members. Hefei High Tech Park was also approved as a National High Tech Export Base in 2000 and obtained the award of an Advanced High Tech Zone under the Torch Program in 2003. So far, more than 100 hi-tech enterprises have entered the zone. Industries encouraged in the zone include chemical production and processing, electronics assembly &amp; manufacturing, instruments &amp; industrial equipment, medical Equipment and telecommunications.

====Wuhu Economic and Technological Development Zone====
Established in 1993, Wuhu Economic and Technological Development Zone was the first state-level development zone approved by central government in Anhui, utilising the transportation advantage of the Yangtse Delta at Wuhu.

====Wuhu Export Processing Zone====
Wuhu Export Processing Zone was approved to be a national level export processing zone, with a total planned area of .

==Transportation==

Historically, Anhui&#x27;s transport network was hampered by the lack of bridges across the Yangtze River, which divides the province into northern and southern regions. The first bridge across the Yangtze in Anhui, the Tongling Yangtze River Bridge, was completed in 1995. As of October 2014, Anhui had four bridges across the Yangtze, at Ma&#x27;anshan, Wuhu, Tongling, and Anqing.

===Rail===
Anhui lacked a developed railway network until this century: most cities are now connected by a high-speed train system. Hefei South railway station is the high-speed train hub.

===Highway system===
The province set an ambitious plan from 2015 to 2025 for highways including:

G3 Beijing-Taipei Expressway

G40 Shanghai-Xi&#x27;an Expressway

G42 Shanghai-Chengdu Expressway

S24 Changshu-Hefei Expressway

===Subway===
Hefei and Wuhu have subway systems. The Hefei Metro has 2 completed lines, 3 lines under construction and another 10 lines planned. The Wuhu Metro has 2 subway lines under construction and another 3 lines planned.

===Aviation===
The province has 5 major commercial airports and another 4 are under construction. Hefei Xinqiao International Airport and Huangshan International Airport are the 2 international airports. The 5 airports in operation are:

*Hefei Xinqiao International Airport 
*Huangshan Tunxi International Airport 
*Fuyang Xiguan Airport 
*Anqing Tianzhushan Airport 
*Chizhou Jiuhuashan Airport 

==Demographics==

Han Chinese make up the vast majority of the population. The Hui and She are the two largest minorities.

Anhui has a highly unbalanced gender ratio. According to a 2009 study published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, in the 1–4 age group, there are 138 boys for every 100 girls, making it among the most unbalanced of provinces in China.

=== Religion ===
The predominant religions in Anhui are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 4.64% of the population believes and is involved in ancestor veneration, while 5.30% of the population identifies as Christian. According to a 2010 survey, Muslims constitute 0.58% of the population of Anhui.

The reports didn&#x27;t give figures for other types of religion; 89.48% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism and folk religious sects.

==Culture==
Anhui spans many geographical and cultural regions. The northern, flatter parts of the province, along the Huai River and further north, are most akin to neighboring provinces like Henan, Shandong and northern Jiangsu. In contrast, the southern, hilly parts of the province are more similar in culture and dialect to other southern, hilly provinces, like Zhejiang and Jiangxi.

Mandarin dialects are spoken over the northern and central parts of the province, north of the Yangtze river. Dialects to the north (e.g. Bengbu dialect) are classified as Zhongyuan Mandarin, together with dialects in provinces such as Henan and Shandong; dialects in the central parts (e.g. Hefei dialect) are classified as Jianghuai Mandarin, together with dialects in the central parts of neighboring Jiangsu province. Non-Mandarin dialects are spoken to the south of the Yangzi: dialects of Wu are spoken in Xuancheng prefecture-level city, though these are rapidly being replaced by Jianghuai Mandarin; dialects of Gan are spoken in a few counties in the southwest bordering Jiangxi province; and the Huizhou dialects are spoken in about ten counties in the far south, a small but highly diverse and unique group of Chinese dialects.

Huangmeixi, which originated in the environs of Anqing in southwestern Anhui, is a form of traditional Chinese opera popular across China. Huiju, a form of traditional opera originating in the Huizhou-speaking areas of southern Anhui, is one of the major precursors of Beijing Opera; in the 1950s, Huiju (which had disappeared) was revived. Luju is a type of traditional opera found across central Anhui, from east to west.

Anhui cuisine is one of the eight great traditions of Chinese cuisine. Combining elements of cooking from northern Anhui, south-central Anhui, and the Huizhou-speaking areas of southern Anhui, Anhui cuisine is known for its use of wild game and herbs, both land and sea, and comparatively simple methods of preparation.

Anhui has a high concentration of traditional products related to calligraphy: Xuanzhou (today Xuancheng) and Huizhou (today Huangshan City) are revered for producing Xuan Paper and Hui Ink respectively, which are traditionally considered the best types of paper and ink for Chinese calligraphy. She County is famous for the She Inkstone, one of the most preferred types of inkstones (a required tool in traditional calligraphy). 

==Education==

Anhui has some good universities. Most universities in Anhui are located in Hefei, Wuhu, Bengbu, Maanshan, some of them are pretty well known. Specifically, Hefei is one of the most important research central cities in China with leading basic scientific research capability.

<doc id="105060" wikidata="Q215502" url="?curid=105060" title="Henry Morgan">
<text>Sir Henry Morgan (; – 25 August 1688) was a Welsh privateer, plantation owner, and, later, Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica. From his base in Port Royal, Jamaica, he and those under his command raided settlements and shipping ports on the Spanish Main, becoming wealthy as they did so. With the prize money and loot from the raids, Morgan purchased three large sugar plantations on Jamaica.

Much of Morgan&#x27;s early life is unknown; he was born in an area of Monmouthshire that is now part of the city of Cardiff. It is not known how he made his way to the West Indies, or how the Welshman began his career as a privateer. He was probably a member of a group of raiders led by Sir Christopher Myngs in the early 1660s during the Anglo-Spanish War. Morgan became a close friend of Sir Thomas Modyford, the Governor of Jamaica; as diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of England and Spain worsened in 1667, Modyford gave Morgan a letter of marque, or a licence, to attack and seize Spanish vessels. Morgan subsequently conducted successful and highly lucrative raids on Puerto del Príncipe (now Camagüey in modern Cuba) and Porto Bello (now Portobelo in modern Panamá). In 1668, he sailed for Maracaibo, Venezuela, and Gibraltar, on Lake Maracaibo; he plundered both cities before destroying a large Spanish squadron as he escaped. 

In 1671, Morgan and company attacked Panama City, landing on the Caribbean coast and traversing the isthmus and its jungles before they attacked the city, located on the Pacific coast. This event occurred after the signing of a peace treaty, and, to appease the Spanish, Morgan was arrested and summoned to London in 1672; the Welshman was popularly celebrated as a hero and soon regained the favour of the government and King Charles II.

Morgan was then appointed a Knight Bachelor in November 1674 and returned to the Colony of Jamaica shortly thereafter to serve as the territory&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor. He served on the Assembly of Jamaica until 1683; on three occasions, he acted as governor in the absence of the then-current post-holder. His reputation was marred by a scurrilous memoir by Alexandre Exquemelin, a former Flemish shipmate of Morgan&#x27;s, accusing him of widespread torture and other offences, including during the infamous raid on Panama City. Morgan won a libel suit against the book&#x27;s English publishers, but Exquemelin&#x27;s portrayal has negatively shifted the public&#x27;s, and history&#x27;s, view of Morgan as a scoundrel. His life was further romanticised after his 1688 passing, as he became the inspiration for pirate-themed works of fiction across a range of genres.

==Early life==
Born Harri Morgan around 1635 in Wales, either in Llanrumney or Pencarn (both in Monmouthshire, between Cardiff and Newport). The historian David Williams, writing in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography, observes that attempts to identify his parents and antecedents &quot;have all proved unsatisfactory&quot;, although his will referred to distant relations. Several sources state Morgan&#x27;s father was Robert Morgan, a farmer. Nuala Zahedieh, writing for the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, states that details of Morgan&#x27;s early life and career are uncertain, although in later life he stated that he had left school early and was &quot;much more used to the pike than the book&quot;.

It is unknown how Morgan made his way to the Caribbean. He may have travelled to the Caribbean as part of the army of Robert Venables, sent by Oliver Cromwell as part of the Caribbean expedition against the Spanish in the West Indies in 1654, or he may have served as an apprentice to a maker of cutlery for three years in exchange for the cost of his emigration. Richard Browne, who served as surgeon under Morgan in 1670 stated that Morgan had travelled either as a &quot;private gentleman&quot; soon after the 1655 capture of Jamaica by the English, or he may have been abducted in Bristol and transported to Barbados, where he was sold as a servant. In the 17th century the Caribbean offered an opportunity for young men to become rich quickly, although significant investment was needed to obtain high returns from the sugar export economy. Other opportunities for financial gain were through trade or plunder of the Spanish Empire. Much of the plunder was from privateering, whereby individuals and ships were commissioned by government to attack the country&#x27;s enemies.

==Career as a privateer==

It is probable that in the early 1660s Morgan was active with a group of privateers led by Sir Christopher Myngs attacking Spanish cities and settlements in the Caribbean and Central America when England was at war with Spain. It is likely that in 1663 Morgan captained one of the ships in Myngs&#x27; fleet, and took part in the attack on Santiago de Cuba and the Sack of Campeche on the Yucatán Peninsula.

Sir Thomas Modyford had been appointed the Governor of Jamaica in February 1664 with instructions to limit the activities of the privateers; he made a proclamation against their activities on 11 June 1664, but economic practicalities led to his reversing the policy by the end of the month. About 1,500 privateers used Jamaica as a base for their activity and brought much revenue to the island. As the planting community of 5,000 was still new and developing, the revenue from the privateers was needed to avoid economic collapse. A privateer was granted a letter of marque which gave him a licence to attack and seize vessels, normally of a specified country, or with conditions attached. A portion of all spoils obtained by the privateers was given to the sovereign or the issuing ambassador.

In August 1665 Morgan, along with fellow captains John Morris and Jacob Fackman, returned to Port Royal with a large cargo of valuables. Modyford was impressed enough with the spoils to report back to the government that &quot;Central America was the properest place for an attack on the Spanish Indies&quot;. Morgan&#x27;s activities over the following two years are not documented, but in early 1666 he was married in Port Royal to his cousin, Mary Morgan, the daughter of Edward, the island&#x27;s Deputy Governor; the marriage gave Henry access to the upper levels of Jamaican society. The couple had no children.

Hostilities between the English and Dutch in 1664 led to a change in government policy: colonial governors were now authorised to issue letters of marque against the Dutch. Many of the privateers, including Morgan, did not take up the letters, although an expedition to conquer the Dutch island of Sint Eustatius led to the death of Morgan&#x27;s father-in-law, who was leading a 600-man force.

Sources differ about Morgan&#x27;s activities in 1666. H. R. Allen, in his biography of Morgan, considers the privateer was the second-in-command to Captain Edward Mansvelt. Mansvelt had been issued a letter of marque for the invasion of Curaçao, although he did not attack Willemstad, the main city, either after he decided that it was too well defended or that there was insufficient plunder. Alternatively, Jan Rogoziński and Stephan Talty, in their histories of Morgan and piracy, record that during the year, Morgan oversaw the Port Royal militia and the defence of Jamaica; Fort Charles at Port Royal was partly constructed under his leadership. It was around this time that Morgan purchased his first plantation on Jamaica.

===Puerto del Príncipe (1667)===
In 1667 diplomatic relations between the kingdoms of England and Spain were worsening, and rumours began to circulate in Jamaica about a possible Spanish invasion. Modyford authorised privateers to take action against the Spanish, and issued a letter of marque to Morgan &quot;to draw together the English privateers and take prisoners of the Spanish nation, whereby he might inform of the intention of that enemy to attack Jamaica, of which I have frequent and strong advice&quot;. He was given the rank of admiral and, in January 1668, assembled 10 ships and 500 men for the task; he was subsequently joined by 2 more ships and 200 men from Tortuga (now part of Haiti).

Morgan&#x27;s letter of marque gave him permission to attack Spanish ships at sea; there was no permission for attacks on land. Any plunder obtained from the attacks would be split between the government and the owners of the ships rented by the privateers. If the privateers stepped outside their official remit and raided a city, any resultant plunder would be retained by the privateers. Rogoziński observes that &quot;attacks on cities were illegal piracybut extremely profitable&quot;, although Zahedieh records that if Morgan was able to provide evidence of a potential Spanish attack, the attacks on cities were justifiable under the terms of his commission. Morgan&#x27;s initial plan was to attack Havana, but, on discovering it was heavily defended, changed the target to Puerto del Príncipe (now Camagüey), a town inland. Morgan and his men took the town, but the treasure obtained was less than hoped for. According to Alexandre Exquemelin, who sailed with Morgan, &quot;It caused a general resentment and grief, to see such a small booty&quot;. When Morgan reported the taking of Puerto Principe to Modyford, he informed the governor that they had evidence that the Spanish were planning an attack on British territory: &quot;we found seventy men had been pressed to go against Jamaica ... and considerable forces were expected from Vera Cruz and Campeachy ... and from Porto Bello and Cartagena to rendezvous at St Jago of Cuba [Santiago]&quot;.

After the action, one of the English privateers quarrelled with one of his French shipmates and stabbed him in the back, killing him. Before a riot between the French and English sailors could begin, Morgan arrested the English sailor, and promised the French sailors that the man would be hanged on his return to Port Royal. Morgan kept his word and the sailor was hanged.

===Porto Bello (1668)===

After dividing the spoils
of the conquest of Puerto del Príncipe, Morgan announced a plan to attack Porto Bello (now in modern-day Panama). The city was the third largest and strongest on the Spanish Main , and on one of the main routes of trade between the Spanish territories and Spain. Because of the value of the goods passing through its port, Porto Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another in the town. The 200 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure and the murder of their countryman, left Morgan&#x27;s service and returned to Tortuga. Morgan and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for Porto Bello.

On 11 July 1668 Morgan anchored short of Porto Bello and transferred his men to 23 canoes, which they paddled to within of the target. They landed and approached the first castle from the landward side, where they arrived half an hour before dawn. They took the three castles and the town quickly. The privateers lost 18 men, with a further 32 wounded; Zahedieh considers the action at Porto Bello displayed a &quot;clever cunning and expert timing which marked ... [Morgan&#x27;s] brilliance as a military commander&quot;.

Exquemelin wrote that in order to take the third castle, Morgan ordered the construction of ladders wide enough for three men to climb abreast; when they were completed he &quot;commanded all the religious men and women whom he had taken prisoners to fix them against the walls of the castle ... these were forced, at the head of the companies to raise and apply them to the walls ... Thus many of the religious men and nuns were killed&quot;. Terry Breverton, in his biography of Morgan, writes that when a translation of Exquemelin&#x27;s book was published in England, Morgan sued for libel and won. The passage about the use of nuns and monks as a human shield was retracted from subsequent publications in England.
Morgan and his men remained in Porto Bello for a month. He wrote to Don Agustín, the acting president of Panama, to demand a ransom for the city of 350,000 pesos. As they stripped the city of its wealth it is probable that torture was used on the residents to uncover hidden caches of money and jewels. Zahedieh records that there were no first-hand reports from witnesses that confirmed Exquemelin&#x27;s claim of widespread rape and debauchery. After an attempt by Don Agustín to recapture the city by force – his army of 800 soldiers was repelled by the privateers – he negotiated a ransom of 100,000 pesos. Following the ransom and the plunder of the city, Morgan returned to Port Royal, with between £70,000 and £100,000 of money and valuables; Zahedieh reports that the figures were more than the agricultural output of Jamaica, and nearly half Barbados&#x27;s sugar exports. Each privateer received £120 – equivalent to five or six times the average annual earnings of a sailor of the time. Morgan received a five per cent share for his work; Modyford received a ten per cent share, which was the price of Morgan&#x27;s letter of marque. As Morgan had overstepped the limits of his commission, Modyford reported back to London that he had &quot;reproved&quot; him for his actions although, Zahedieh observes, in Britain &quot;Morgan was widely viewed as a national hero and neither he nor Modyford were rebuked for their actions&quot;.

===Lake Maracaibo and Gibraltar (1668–1669)===
Morgan did not stay long in Port Royal and in October 1668 sailed with ten ships and 800 men for Île-à-Vache, a small island he used as a rendezvous point. His plan was to attack the Spanish settlement of Cartagena de Indias, the richest and most important city on the Spanish Main. In December he was joined by a former Royal Navy frigate, &quot;Oxford&quot;, which had been sent to Port Royal to aid in any defence of Jamaica. Modyford sent the vessel to Morgan, who made it his flagship. On 2 January 1669 Morgan called a council of war for all his captains, which took place on &quot;Oxford&quot;. A spark in the ship&#x27;s powder magazine destroyed the ship and over 200 of its crew. Morgan and the captains seated on one side of the table were blown into the water and survived; the four captains on the other side of the table were all killed.

The loss of &quot;Oxford&quot; meant Morgan&#x27;s flotilla was too small to attempt an attack on Cartagena. Instead he was persuaded by a French captain under his command to repeat the actions of the pirate François l&#x27;Olonnais two years previously: an attack on Maracaibo and Gibraltar, both on Lake Maracaibo in modern-day Venezuela. The French captain knew the approaches to the lagoon, through a narrow and shallow channel. Since l&#x27;Olonnais and the French captain had visited Maracaibo, the Spanish had built the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, outside the city, on the approach. Talty states that the fortress was placed in an excellent position to defend the town, but that the Spanish had undermanned it, leaving only nine men to load and fire the fortress&#x27;s 11 guns. Under covering cannon fire from the privateer&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Lilly&quot;, Morgan and his men landed on the beach and stormed the fortification; they found it empty when they eventually breached its defences. A search soon found that the Spanish had left a slow-burning fuse leading to the fort&#x27;s powder kegs as a trap for the buccaneers, which Morgan extinguished. The fort&#x27;s guns were spiked and then buried so they could not be used against the privateers when they returned from the rest of their mission.
Morgan arrived at Maracaibo to find the city largely deserted, its residents having been forewarned of his approach by the fortress&#x27;s troops. He spent three weeks sacking the city. Privateers searched the surrounding jungle to find the escapees; they, and some of the remaining occupants, were tortured to find where money or treasure had been hidden. Satisfied he had stolen all he could, he sailed south across Lake Maracaibo, to Gibraltar. The town&#x27;s occupants refused to surrender, and the fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure Morgan kept his distance. He anchored a short distance away and his men landed by canoe and assaulted the town from the landward approach. He met scant resistance, as many of the occupants had fled into the surrounding jungle. He spent five weeks in Gibraltar, and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables.

Four days after he left Maracaibo, Morgan returned. He was told that a Spanish defence squadron, the Armada de Barlovento, was waiting for him at the narrow passage between the Caribbean and Lake Maracaibo, where the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress was sited. The forces, under the command of Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa, had 126 cannon with which to attack Morgan, and had re-armed San Carlos de la Barra Fortress. The Spaniards had orders to end piracy in the Caribbean, and negotiations between Morgan and Espinosa continued for a week. The final offer put by the Spanish commander was for Morgan to leave all their spoils and slaves and to return to Jamaica unmolested, but no agreement was reached that would allow Morgan and his men to pass the fleet with their spoils but without attack. Morgan put the Spaniards&#x27; offers to his men, who voted instead to fight their way out. As they were heavily outgunned, one privateer suggested that a fire ship aimed at Espinosa&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Magdalen&quot; would work.

To this end, a crew of 12 prepared a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make it look more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder were placed in the ship and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of &quot;Magdalen&quot; and ensure the vessels would become entangled.
On 1 May 1669 Morgan and his flotilla attacked the Spanish squadron. The fire ship plan worked, and &quot;Magdalen&quot; was shortly aflame; Espinosa abandoned his flagship and made his way to the fort, where he continued to direct events. The second-largest Spanish ship, &quot;Soledad&quot;, tried to move away from the burning vessel, but a problem with the rigging meant they drifted aimlessly; privateers boarded the ship, fixed the rigging and claimed the craft as plunder. The third Spanish vessel was also sunk by the privateers. Morgan still needed to pass the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, but was still out-gunned by the stronghold, which had the ability to destroy the privateer fleet if it tried to pass. The privateer decided to negotiate, and threatened to sack and burn Maracaibo if he was not allowed to pass. Although Espinosa refused to negotiate, the citizens of Maracaibo entered into talks with Morgan, and agreed to pay him 20,000 pesos and 500 head of cattle if he agreed to leave the city intact. During the course of the negotiations with the Maracaibos, Morgan had undertaken salvage operations on &quot;Magdalen&quot;, and secured 15,000 pesos from the wreck. Before taking any action, Morgan tallied his takings and divided it equally between his ships, to ensure that it was not all lost if one ship was sunk; it totalled 250,000 pesos, and a huge quantity of merchandise and a number of local slaves.

Morgan observed that Espinosa had set his cannon for a landward attack from the privateers – as they had done previously. The privateers faked a landing of their forces. The fort and its battlements were stripped of men as the Spanish prepared for a night assault from the English forces. That evening, with Spanish forces deployed to repel a landing, Morgan&#x27;s fleet raised anchor without unfurling their sails; the fleet moved on the tide, raising sail only when it had moved level with the fortress, and Morgan and his men made their way back to Port Royal unscathed. Zahedieh considers the escape showed Morgan&#x27;s &quot;characteristic cunning and audacity&quot;.

During his absence from Port Royal, a pro-Spanish faction had gained the ear of King Charles II, and English foreign policy had changed accordingly. Modyford admonished Morgan for his action, which had gone beyond his commission, and revoked the letters of marque; no official action was taken against any of the privateers. Morgan invested a share of his prize money in an plantation – his second such investment.

===Attack on Panama (1669–1671)===
In 1669 Mariana, the Queen Regent of Spain, ordered attacks on English shipping in the Caribbean. The first action took place in March 1670 when Spanish privateers attacked English trade ships. In response Modyford commissioned Morgan &quot;to do and perform all manner of exploits, which may tend to the preservation and quiet of this island&quot;. By December Morgan was sailing toward the Spanish Main with a fleet of over 30 English and French ships carrying a large number of privateers. Zahedieh observes that the army of privateers was the largest that had gathered in the Caribbean at the time, which was &quot;a mark of Morgan&#x27;s renown&quot;.

Morgan&#x27;s first action was to take the connected islands of Old Providence and Santa Catalina in December 1670. From there his fleet sailed to Chagres, the port from which ships were loaded with goods to transport back to Spain. Morgan took the town and occupied Fort San Lorenzo, which he garrisoned to protect his line of retreat. On 9 January 1671, with his remaining men, he ascended the Chagres River and headed for Panama City, on the Pacific coast. Much of the journey was on foot, through dense rainforests and swamps. The governor of Panama had been forewarned of a potential attack, and had sent Spanish troops to attack Morgan and his men along the route. The privateers transferred to canoes to complete part of the journey, but were still able to beat off the ambushes with ease. After three days, with the river difficult to navigate in places, and with the jungle thinning out, Morgan landed his men and travelled overland across the remaining part of the isthmus.

The privateers, including Captain Robert Searle, arrived at Old Panama City on 27 January 1671; they camped overnight before attacking the following day. They were opposed by approximately 1,200 Spanish infantry and 400 cavalry; most were inexperienced. Morgan sent a 300-strong party of men down a ravine that led to the foot of a small hill on the Spanish right flank. As they disappeared from view, the Spanish front line thought the privateers were retreating, and the left wing broke rank and chased, followed by the remainder of the defending infantry. They were met with well-organised firing from Morgan&#x27;s main force of troops. When the party came into view at the end of the ravine, they were charged by the Spanish cavalry, but organised fire destroyed the cavalry and the party attacked the flank of the main Spanish force. In an effort to disorganise Morgan&#x27;s forces, the governor of Panama released two herds of oxen and bulls onto the battlefield; scared by the noise of the gunfire, they turned and stampeded over their keepers and some of the remaining Spanish troops. The battle was a rout: the Spanish lost between 400 and 500 men, against 15 privateers killed.
Panama&#x27;s governor had sworn to burn down the city if his troops lost to the privateers, and he had placed barrels of gunpowder around the largely wooden buildings. These were detonated by the captain of artillery after Morgan&#x27;s victory; the resultant fires lasted until the following day. Only a few stone buildings remained standing afterwards. Much of Panama&#x27;s wealth was destroyed in the conflagration, although some had been removed by ships, before the privateers arrived. The privateers spent three weeks in Panama and plundered what they could from the ruins. Morgan&#x27;s second-in-command, Captain Edward Collier, supervised the torture of some of the city&#x27;s residents; Morgan&#x27;s fleet surgeon, Richard Browne, later wrote that at Panama, Morgan &quot;was noble enough to the vanquished enemy&quot;.

The value of treasure Morgan collected during his expedition is disputed. Talty writes that the figures range from 140,000 to 400,000 pesos, and that owing to the large army Morgan assembled, the prize-per-man was relatively low, causing discontent. There were accusations, particularly in Exquemelin&#x27;s memoirs, that Morgan left with the majority of the plunder. He arrived back in Port Royal on 12 March to a positive welcome from the town&#x27;s inhabitants. The following month he made his official report to the governing Council of Jamaica, and received their formal thanks and congratulations.

==Arrest and release; knighthood and governorship (1672–1675)==

During Morgan&#x27;s absence from Jamaica, news reached the island that England and Spain had signed the Treaty of Madrid. The pact aimed to establish peace in the Caribbean between the two countries; it included an agreement to revoke all letters of marque and similar commissions. The historian Violet Barbour considers it probable that one of the Spanish conditions was the removal of Modyford from the Governorship. Modyford was arrested and sent to England by his replacement Sir Thomas Lynch.

The destruction of Panama so soon after the signing of the treaty led to what Allen describes as &quot;a crisis in international affairs&quot; between England and Spain. The English government heard rumours from their ambassadors in Europe that the Spanish were considering war. In an attempt to appease them, Charles II and his Secretary of State, the Earl of Arlington, ordered Morgan&#x27;s arrest despite his unfailing loyalty to the English crown. In April 1672 the privateer admiral was returned to London where, Barbour writes, he was &quot;handsomely lionized ... as the hero on whom Drake&#x27;s mantle had fallen&quot;. Although some sources state that Morgan was incarcerated in the Tower of London, Pope finds no evidence of this in the Tower records.

Morgan probably remained at liberty throughout his time in London, and the political mood changed in his favour. Arlington asked him to write a memorandum for the King on improving Jamaica&#x27;s defences. Although Morgan was never charged with an offence, he gave informal evidence to the Lords of Trade and Plantations that he had no knowledge of the Treaty of Madrid prior to his attack on Panama. Unhappy with Lynch&#x27;s conduct in Jamaica, the King and his advisers decided in January 1674 to replace him with John Vaughan, 3rd Earl of Carbery with Morgan sent as his deputy. King Charles appointed Morgan a Knight Bachelor in November 1674, the first time his Welsh name Harri became officially Anglicised to Henry, a common practice in an age of English dominance. Two months later, Morgan and Carbery left for Jamaica. They were accompanied by Modyford, released from the Tower of London without charge and made the Chief Justice of Jamaica. They travelled on board the &quot;Jamaica Merchant&quot;, which held cannon and shot meant to boost Port Royal&#x27;s defences. The ship foundered on the rocks of Île-à-Vache and Morgan and the crew were temporarily stranded on the island until picked up by a passing merchant ship.

==In Jamaican politics (1675–1688)==
On his arrival in Jamaica, the 12-man Assembly of Jamaica voted Morgan an annual salary of £600 &quot;for his good services to the country&quot;; the move angered Carbery, who did not get on with Morgan. Carbery later complained of his deputy that he was &quot;every day more convinced of ... [Morgan&#x27;s] imprudence and unfitness to have anything to do with civil government&quot;. Carbery also wrote to the Secretary of State to bemoan Morgan&#x27;s &quot;drinking and gaming at the taverns&quot; of Port Royal.

Although Morgan had been ordered to eradicate piracy from Jamaican waters, he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a welcome in the city if Morgan received the dues owed to him. As Morgan was no longer able to issue letters of marque to privateer captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Byndloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Byndloss and Morgan received a commission for each one signed.

In July 1676 Carbery called for a hearing against Morgan in front of the Assembly of Jamaica, accusing him of collaborating with the French to attack Spanish interests. Morgan admitted he had met the French officials, but indicated that this was diplomatic relations, rather than anything duplicitous. In the summer of 1677 the Lords of Trade said they had yet to come to a decision on the matter and in early 1678 the king and the Privy Council recalled Carbery from Jamaica, leaving Morgan as governor for three months. In July 1678 Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle, was appointed governor.

By the late 1670s France became an increasing threat in the Caribbean, and Morgan took control of the defence of Port Royal. He declared martial law in 1678 and 1680 – both during his periods as temporary governor of the island – because of the threat of invasion, re-built the fortifications surrounding the town, and increased the number of cannon from 60 to more than 100 in the five years up to 1680.

Morgan and his allies on the Assembly of Jamaica made earnest efforts to deal with privateers and pirates. However, he was soon undermined by his secretary Rowland Powell, who forged his name to an illegal proclamation establishing the monopoly of the Royal African Company. Criticism of Morgan&#x27;s governance was also fomented in London by two former governors of Jamaica, Carbery and Lynch. After Lynch paid £50,000 to Charles II, Morgan&#x27;s commissions as lieutenant-governor and lieutenant-general were revoked and Lynch was appointed as the island&#x27;s governor; Morgan still retained his position on the Assembly of Jamaica. Morgan had been a heavy drinker for several years; he felt his reputation tarnished and received the news of the revocation of his positions badly, increasing his intake of alcohol to the point where his health began to suffer. Lynch removed Morgan&#x27;s supporters from the Assembly of Jamaica by 1683, and in October that year he removed Morgan and his brother-in-law, leaving the assembly packed with men loyal to him. In 1684 Lynch died, and was temporarily replaced as governor by his friend, the lieutenant-general, Hender Molesworth.
In 1684 an account of Morgan&#x27;s exploits was published by Exquemelin, in a Dutch volume entitled &quot;De Americaensche Zee-Roovers&quot; (trans: &quot;About the Buccaneers of America&quot;). Morgan took steps to discredit the book and successfully brought a libel suit against the book&#x27;s publishers William Crooke and Thomas Malthus. In his affidavit he stated that he had &quot;against evil deeds, piracies and robberies the greatest abhorrence and distrust&quot;, and that &quot;for the kind of men called buccaneers&quot;, he &quot;always had and still has hatred&quot;. The court found in his favour and the book was retracted; damages of £200 were paid to him.

In December 1687 Lynch&#x27;s permanent replacement arrived in Port George, Morgan&#x27;s friend from his time in London, Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle. He dismissed Molesworth and gave Morgan an unofficial role as advisor. In July 1688 Albemarle persuaded the king to allow Morgan to regain a position on the Assembly, but the former privateer was too ill to attend. Hans Sloane, Albemarle&#x27;s private physician, inspected Morgan and diagnosed dropsy; he also saw Morgan was drinking to excess and ordered him to reduce his alcohol intake, a directive which Morgan ignored. Sloane described his patient as

lean, sallow-coloured, his eyes a little yellowish and belly jutting out or prominent ... He complained to me of want of appetite for victuals, he had a kicking ... to vomit every morning and generally a small looseness attending him, and withal is much given to drinking and sitting up late, which I supposed had been the cause of his present indisposition.

==Slave plantations==
By the 1670s and 1680s, Morgan, as owner of three large plantations, led three campaigns against the Jamaican Maroons of Juan de Serras. Morgan achieved some success against the Maroons, who withdrew further into the Blue Mountains, where they were able to stay out of his reach. However, Morgan failed in his attempts to capture de Serras and subdue his community of runaway slaves.

By the time of his death, Morgan owned three plantations enslaving large numbers of Africans. He left most of his estate to his wife for her lifetime. On her death, most of his land and slaves were passed to his nephew Charles, second son of Robert Byndloss, who served as Chief Justice of Jamaica in 1681. Morgan also left a parcel of land in the now-defunct parish of St George to another Robert Byndloss (born c. 1673) the eldest son of his brother-in-law Robert Byndloss.

Morgan also left some land in Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica, to his friend, Roger Elletson, ancestor of a future governor of Jamaica with the same name. Morgan&#x27;s will was probated in 1689, and at his death he owned title to 131 Africans as slaves on his estates, 64 men and 67 women, including 33 children, valued at £1,923.

==Death and subsequent events==
Morgan died on 25 August 1688 at Lawrencefield Estate, located in modern Port Maria, Jamaica. Albemarle ordered a state funeral, and laid Morgan&#x27;s body at King&#x27;s House for the public to pay respects. An amnesty was declared so that pirates and privateers could pay their respects without fear of arrest. He was buried at Palisadoes cemetery, Port Royal, followed by a 22-gun salute from the ships moored in the harbour. Morgan was a wealthy man when he died. His personal wealth was valued at £5,263.

His will initially left his plantations and slaves to his wife, Mary Elizabeth, but because they were childless, on her death his estate was to pass to his nephews, the children of his brother-in-law Byndloss. The burial of Lady Morgan was recorded in Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica, on 3 March 1696.

In his will, signed on 17 June 1688, Morgan left his Jamaican property to his godsons Charles Byndloss and Henry Archbold, on condition they adopted the surname of Morgan. These were the children of his two cousins Anna Petronilla Byndloss and Johanna Archbold. To his sister Catherine Loyd he awarded £60 per annum from his estate &quot;paid into the hands of my ever honest cozen Thomas Morgan of Tredegar&quot;.

On 7 June 1692 an earthquake struck Port Royal. About two-thirds of the town, amounting to 33 acres (13 ha), sank into Kingston Harbour immediately after the main shock. Palisadoes cemetery, including Morgan&#x27;s grave, was one of the parts of the city to fall into the sea; his body has never been subsequently located.

==Legacy==

Rogoziński observes that Morgan is probably the &quot;best-known pirate&quot; because of Exquemelin&#x27;s book, although, Cordingly writes that Exquemelin bore a grudge over what he saw was Morgan&#x27;s theft of the bounty from Panama. His experience explains &quot;why he painted such a black picture of Morgan and portrayed him as a cruel and unscrupulous villain&quot;, which subsequently affected historians&#x27; view of Morgan. Allen observes that, partly because of Exquemelin, Morgan has not been well-served by historians. He cites the examples of the historians whose biographies were so flawed they wrote that Morgan had died in either London, prison or the Tower of London. These included Charles Leslie, &quot;A New History of Jamaica&quot; (1739), Alan Gardner, &quot;History of Jamaica&quot; (1873), Hubert Bancroft, &quot;History of Central America&quot; (1883) and Howard Pyle&#x27;s work, &quot;Howard Pyle&#x27;s Book of Pirates&quot; (compiled in 1921).

Exquemelin wrote that Morgan&#x27;s men undertook widespread torture in several of the towns they captured. According to Stephen Snelders, in his history of piracy, the Spanish reports of Morgan&#x27;s raids do not refer to torture being practiced on the residents of Porto Bello or Gibraltar – although there are reliable reports that it was carried out in Panama. The historian Patrick Pringle observes that while torture seems cruel and ruthless to contemporary eyes, it was an accepted part of judicial interrogation in many European countries at the time. Morgan always fought with a commission from the governor of Jamaica. In doing so, he was acting as a reserve naval force for the English government in the defence of Jamaica. As the Spanish did not recognise privateering as a legal activity, even if a captain carried letters of marque, they considered Morgan to be a pirate, something he firmly rejected.
Rogoziński observes that Morgan does not appear in later fictional works as much as other pirates because of his &quot;ambiguous mixture of charismatic leadership and selfish treachery&quot;, although his name and persona have featured in literature, including Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Captain Blood&quot; and John Steinbeck&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Cup of Gold&quot; (1929), both of which are based in large part on Morgan&#x27;s career. Morgan and stories of a hidden haul of treasure also feature to a lesser extent in other works, including Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; and John Masefield&#x27;s 1920 poem &quot;Captain Stratton&#x27;s Fancy&quot;. Screen renditions of his life include &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935), &quot;The Black Swan&quot; (1942), &quot;Blackbeard the Pirate&quot; (1952), &quot;Morgan, the Pirate&quot; (1961), &quot;Pirates of Tortuga&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Black Corsair&quot; (1976). Morgan has also been featured in several video games, including &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates!&quot; and &quot;Age of Pirates 2: City of Abandoned Ships&quot;.

In 1944 the Seagram Company started manufacturing the Captain Morgan brand of rum, named after the privateer. In 2001 the Captain Morgan brand was sold to Diageo, the multinational drinks company based in London. The name of Morgan has been attached to local sites in the Caribbean, such as Morgan&#x27;s Bridge, Morgan&#x27;s Pass and Morgan&#x27;s Valley in Clarendon, Morgan&#x27;s Harbour Hotel and Beach Club in Kingston, the Hotel Henry Morgan, located in Roatán, Honduras, the Port Morgan resort located in Haiti and Captain Morgan&#x27;s Retreat and Vacation Club on Ambergris Caye, Belize.

The economist Peter Leeson believes that pirates and privateers were generally shrewd businessmen, far removed from the modern, romanticised view of them as murderous brigands. The anthropologist Anne M. Galvin and the historian Kris Lane both view Morgan as seeking wealth to enter the landed gentry; Galvin wrote that Morgan pursued &quot;social mobility through self-interested acts of outlawry, political wiles, and business acumen&quot;. Glenn Blalock, writing for the &quot;American National Biography&quot;, claims that Morgan was a hero to many Jamaicans and British both for his exploits as a buccaneer and for defending Jamaica for the British Empire. However, some Jamaicans see Morgan as a &quot;criminal pirate&quot; who sought to maintain the system of slavery.

Thomas describes Morgan as

a man of courage, determination, bravery, and ... charisma. He was a planner, a brilliant military strategist and intensely loyal to the king, to England and to Jamaica. ... But unlike so many of the Brethren, he was flexible and adaptable, able to see that the future for Jamaica lay not in plunder or pillage but in peaceful trade. ... He was also an adept politician and held office longer than any of the governors of his time.

<text>Spitsbergen (; formerly known as West Spitsbergen; Norwegian: &quot;Vest Spitsbergen&quot; or &quot;Vestspitsbergen&quot; , also sometimes spelled Spitzbergen) is the largest and the only permanently populated island of the Svalbard archipelago in northern Norway in the Arctic Ocean.

Constituting the westernmost bulk of the archipelago, it borders the Arctic Ocean, the Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea. Spitsbergen covers an area of , making it the largest island in Norway and the 36th largest in the world. The administrative centre is Longyearbyen. Other settlements, in addition to research outposts, are the mining community of Barentsburg, the research community of Ny-Ålesund, and the mining outpost of Sveagruva. Spitsbergen was covered in of ice in 1999, which was approximately 58.5% of the island&#x27;s total area.

The island was first used as a whaling base in the 17th and 18th centuries, after which it was abandoned. Coal mining started at the end of the 19th century, and several permanent communities were established. The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognized Norwegian sovereignty and established Svalbard as a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone.

The Norwegian Store Norske and the Russian Arktikugol are the only mining companies at Spitsbergen. Research and tourism have become the important supplementary industries, featuring among others the University Centre in Svalbard and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. No roads connect the settlements; instead snowmobiles, aircraft and boats serve as local transport. Svalbard Airport, Longyearbyen provides the main point of entry and exit.

The island has an Arctic climate, although with significantly higher temperatures than other places at the same latitude. The flora benefits from the long period of midnight sun, which compensates for the polar night. Svalbard is a breeding ground for many seabirds and also supports polar bears, arctic foxes, reindeer, and marine mammals. Six national parks protect the largely untouched, yet fragile environment. The island has many glaciers, mountains, and fjords.

==Etymology==
The Dutch navigator Willem Barentsz gave Spitsbergen its name when he discovered it in 1596. The name &quot;Spitsbergen&quot;, meaning &quot;pointed mountains&quot; (from the Dutch &quot;spits&quot; - pointed, &quot;bergen&quot; - mountains), at first applied both to the main island and to the associated archipelago as a whole. In the 17th and 18th centuries, English whalers referred to the islands as &quot;Greenland&quot;, a practice still followed in 1780 and criticized by Sigismund Bacstrom at that time. The &quot;Spitzbergen&quot; spelling was used in English during the 19th century, for instance by Beechey, Laing, and the Royal Society.

In 1906 the Arctic explorer Sir Martin Conway regarded the &quot;Spitzbergen&quot; spelling as incorrect; he preferred &quot;Spitsbergen&quot;, as he noted that the name was Dutch, not German. This had little effect on British practice. In 1920 the international treaty determining the status of the islands was entitled the &quot;Spitsbergen Treaty&quot;. The islands were generally referred to in the United States as &quot;Spitsbergen&quot; from that time, although the spelling &quot;Spitzbergen&quot; also commonly occurred through the 20th century.

The Norwegian administrating authorities named the archipelago &quot;Svalbard&quot; in 1925, the main island becoming &quot;Spitsbergen&quot;. By the end of the 20th century, this usage had become common.

==History==

The first recorded sighting of the island was by Willem Barentsz, a Dutch explorer who came across it while searching for the Northern Sea Route in June 1596. The first good map, with the east coast roughly indicated, appeared in 1623, printed by Willem Janszoon Blaeu. Around 1660 and 1728, better maps were produced.

The archipelago may have been known to Russian Pomor hunters as early as the 14th or 15th century, although solid evidence preceding the 17th century is lacking. Following the English whalers and others in referring to the archipelago as Greenland, they named it Grumant (Грумант). The name Svalbard is first mentioned in Icelandic sagas of the 10th and 11th centuries, but this may have been Jan Mayen.

===Early claims===
Early whaling expeditions to Svalbard in general and Spitsbergen in particular tended, because of currents and fauna, to cluster on the western coast of Spitsbergen and the islands off shore. Shortly after whaling began (1611), the Danish–Norwegian crown in 1616 claimed ownership of Jan Mayen and the Spitsbergen islands, as all of Svalbard was then known, but in 1613, the English Muscovy Company had done the same.

The primary and most profitable whaling grounds of this joint-stock company came to be centered on Spitsbergen in the early 17th century, and the company&#x27;s 1613 Royal Charter from the English Crown granted a monopoly on whaling in Spitsbergen, based on the (erroneous) claim that Hugh Willoughby had discovered the land in 1553. Not only had they wrongly assumed a 1553 English voyage had reached the area, but on 27 June 1607, during his first voyage in search of a &quot;northeast passage&quot; on behalf of the company, Henry Hudson sighted &quot;Newland&quot; (i.e. Spitsbergen), near the mouth of the great bay Hudson later named the Great Indraught (Isfjorden). In this way, the English hoped to head off expansion in the region by the Dutch, at the time their major rival.
Initially, the English tried to drive away competitors, but after disputes with the Dutch (1613–24), they, for the most part, only claimed the bays south of Kongsfjorden.

===Danish expansion===

From 1617 onwards, a Danish-chartered company began sending whaling fleets to Spitsbergen. This successful expansion by Denmark into the North Atlantic has recently been cited by historians as the first step of the Danish–Norwegian state into overseas colonialism. It eventually built a small overseas empire of East Indian trade posts, North Atlantic possessions (such as Greenland and Iceland), and a small Atlantic trade route between possessions on the Guinea Coast (in modern Ghana) and what are now the United States Virgin Islands.

The entire Svalbard archipelago, nominally ruled first by Denmark–Norway, and later the Norwegians (as Union between Sweden and Norway from 1814 to 1905, independent Norway from 1905), remained a source of riches for fishery and whaling vessels from many nations. The islands also became the launching point for a number of Arctic explorers, including William Edward Parry, Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, Otto Martin Torell, Alfred Gabriel Nathorst, Roald Amundsen and Ernest Shackleton.

===Spitsbergen Treaty===

Between 1913 and 1920, Spitsbergen was a neutral condominium. The Spitsbergen Treaty of 9 February 1920, recognises the full and absolute sovereignty of Norway over all the arctic archipelago of Svalbard. The exercise of sovereignty is, however, subject to certain stipulations, and not all Norwegian law applies. Originally limited to nine signatory nations, over 40 are now signatories of the treaty. Citizens of any of the signatory countries may settle in the archipelago. Once named Spitsbergen after its largest island, the Svalbard archipelago was made a part of Norway—not a dependency—by the Svalbard Act of 1925. Since this date, it has been a region of Norway, with a Norwegian-appointed governor resident at the administrative centre of Longyearbyen. Limitations on the imposition of certain Norwegian laws are outlined in the Spitsbergen Treaty.

The largest settlement on Spitsbergen is the Norwegian town of Longyearbyen, while the second-largest settlement is the Russian coal-mining settlement of Barentsburg. (This was sold by the Netherlands in 1932 to the Soviet company Arktikugol.) Other settlements on the island include the former Russian mining communities of Grumantbyen and Pyramiden (abandoned in 1961 and 1998, respectively), a Polish research station at Hornsund, and the remote northern settlement of Ny-Ålesund.

===World War II===

Allied soldiers were stationed on the island in 1941 to prevent Nazi Germany from occupying the islands. Norway came under German occupation in 1940. Germany took control of the coal fields and the weather station during this time, although most of the inhabitants on the island were Russian and Germany and the Soviet Union had a non-aggression pact until 22 June 1941. Once the non-aggression pact was ended, the United Kingdom and Canada sent military forces to the island to destroy German installations, both the Soviet coal mines and the German weather station.

In 1943, the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and an escort flotilla shelled and destroyed the Allied weather station in Operation Zitronella. On 6 September, a squadron consisting of &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, the battleship &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, and nine destroyers weighed anchor in Altenfjord and Kåfjord and headed for Spitsbergen, to attack the Allied base. At dawn on 8 September 1943, &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; opened fire against the two 3-inch guns which comprised the defences of Barentsburg, and the destroyers ran inshore with landing parties, destroying a supply dump and wrecking a landing station. By noon, the hostilities had ended, with the landing parties returning to the ships, along with some prisoners. The German ships returned safely to Altenfjord and Kåfjord on 9 September 1943. This was the last operation for the &quot;Tirpitz&quot;.

=== Postwar ===
On 29 August 1996, Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801 crashed on the island, killing all 141 people on board.

==Government==

The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 established full Norwegian sovereignty over Svalbard. All 40 signatory countries of the treaty have the right to conduct commercial activities on the archipelago without discrimination, although all activity is subject to Norwegian legislation. The treaty limits Norway&#x27;s right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard. Spitsbergen is a demilitarized zone, as the treaty prohibits the establishment of military installations. The treaty requires Norway to protect the natural environment. The island is administered by the Governor of Svalbard, who holds the responsibility as both county governor and chief of police, as well as authority granted from the executive branch. Although Norway is part of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the Schengen Agreement, Svalbard is not part of the Schengen Area nor EEA.

Residents of Spitsbergen do not need visas for Schengen but are prohibited from reaching Svalbard from mainland Norway without them. People without a means of income can be rejected as residents by the governor. Citizens of any treaty signatory country may visit the island without a visa. Russia retains a consulate in Barentsburg.

== Population ==

In 2009, Spitsbergen had a population of 2,753, of whom 423 were Russian or Ukrainian, 10 were Polish and 322 were non-Norwegians living in Norwegian settlements. The largest non-Norwegian groups in Longyearbyen in 2005 were from Thailand, Sweden, Denmark, Russia and Germany. Spitsbergen is among the safest places on Earth, with virtually no crime.

Longyearbyen is the largest settlement on the island, the seat of the governor, and the only incorporated town. It features a hospital, primary and secondary school, university, sports centre with a swimming pool, library, cultural centre, cinema, bus transport, hotels, a bank, and several museums. The newspaper &quot;Svalbardposten&quot; is published weekly. Only a small fraction of the mining activity remains at Longyearbyen; instead, workers commute to Sveagruva (or Svea) where Store Norske operates a mine. Sveagruva is a dorm town, with workers commuting from Longyearbyen on a weekly basis.

Since 2002, Longyearbyen Community Council has had many of the same responsibilities of a municipality, including utilities, education, cultural facilities, fire department, roads and ports. No care or nursing services are available, nor is welfare payment available. Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities. The hospital is part of University Hospital of North Norway, while the airport is operated by state-owned Avinor. Ny-Ålesund and Barentsburg are company towns with all infrastructure owned by Kings Bay and Arktikugol, respectively. Other public offices with presence on Svalbard are the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway. Svalbard is subordinate to Nord-Troms District Court and Hålogaland Court of Appeal, both located in Tromsø.

Ny-Ålesund is a permanent settlement based entirely on research. Formerly a mining town, it is still a company town operated by the Norwegian state-owned Kings Bay. While there is some tourism at the village, Norwegian authorities limit access to the outpost to minimise impact on the scientific work. Ny-Ålesund has a winter population of 35 and a summer population of 180. Poland operates the Polish Polar Station at Hornsund, with ten permanent residents.

Barentsburg is the only remaining Russian settlement, after Pyramiden was abandoned in 1998. A company town, all facilities are owned by Arktikugol, which operates a coal mine. In addition to the mining facilities, Arktikugol has opened a hotel and souvenir shop, catering to tourists taking day trips or hikes from Longyearbyen. The village has facilities such as a school, library, sports center, community center, swimming pool, farm and greenhouse. Pyramiden has similar facilities; both are built in typical Soviet style and are the site of the world&#x27;s two most northerly Lenin statues and other socialist realism artwork.

==Economy==

The three main industries on Spitsbergen are coal mining, tourism and research. In 2007, there were 484 people working in the mining sector, 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, mining produced a revenue of NOK 2,008 million, tourism NOK 317 million and research NOK 142 million. In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK 494,700—23% higher than on the mainland. Almost all housing is owned by the various employers and institutions and rented to their employees; there are only a few privately owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins. Because of this, it is almost impossible to live on Spitsbergen without working for an established institution.

Since the resettlement of Spitsbergen in the early 20th century, coal mining has been the dominant commercial activity. Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, a subsidiary of the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry, operates Svea Nord in Sveagruva and Mine 7 in Longyearbyen. The former produced 3.4 million tonnes in 2008, while the latter sends 35% of its output to Longyearbyen Power Station. Since 2007, there has not been any significant mining by the Russian state-owned Arktikugol in Barentsburg. There has previously been some test drilling for petroleum on land, but this did not give results good enough to justify permanent operation. The Norwegian authorities do not allow offshore petroleum drilling activities for environmental reasons, and the land formerly test-drilled on has been protected as nature reserves or national parks.

Spitsbergen Island coins were issued in 1946, with Russian Cyrillic lettering, in the USSR denomination of 10 and 20 kopecks. Then in 1993, coins were again minted in Russian values of 10, 20, 50 and 100 roubles. Both series have the motto &quot;Arctic coal&quot;.
Spitsbergen was historically a base for both whaling and fishing. Norway claimed a exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Svalbard in 1977, Norway retains a restrictive fisheries policy in the zone, and the claims are disputed by Russia. Tourism is focused on the environment and is centered on Longyearbyen. Activities include hiking, kayaking, walks through glacier caves and snow-scooter and dog-sled safaris. Cruise ships generate a significant portion of the traffic, including stops by both offshore vessels and expeditionary cruises starting and ending in Svalbard. Traffic is strongly concentrated between March and August; overnight stays have quintupled from 1991 to 2008, when there were 93,000 guest-nights.

Research on Svalbard centers on Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund, the most accessible areas in the high Arctic. Norway grants permission for any nation to conduct research on Svalbard, resulting in the Polish Polar Station, Indian Himadri Station, and the Chinese Arctic Yellow River Station, plus Russian facilities in Barentsburg. The University Centre in Svalbard in Longyearbyen offers undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate courses to 350 students in various arctic sciences, particularly biology, geology and geophysics. Courses are provided to supplement studies at the mainland universities; there are no tuition fees and courses are held in English, with Norwegian and international students equally represented.

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a &quot;doomsday&quot; seedbank to store seeds from as many of the world&#x27;s crop varieties and their botanical wild relatives as possible. A cooperative enterprise by the government of Norway and the Global Crop Diversity Trust, the vault is cut into rock near Longyearbyen, keeping it at a natural and refrigerating the seeds to .

The Svalbard Undersea Cable System is a fibre optic line from Svalbard to Harstad, needed for communicating with polar orbiting satellite through Svalbard Satellite Station and installations in Ny-Ålesund.

The Arctic World Archive, a huge digital archiving concern run by Norwegian private company Piql and the state-owned coal-mining company Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, opened in March 2017. In mid-2020, it acquired its biggest customer in the form of GitHub, a subsidiary of Microsoft.

==Transport==

Within Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Ny-Ålesund, there are road systems, but they do not connect with each other. Off-road motorized transport is prohibited on bare ground, but snowmobiles are used extensively during winter—both for commercial and recreational activities. Transport from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg () and Pyramiden () is possible by snowmobile during winter, or by ship all year round. All settlements have ports, and Longyearbyen has a bus system.

Svalbard Airport, Longyear, located from Longyearbyen, is the only airport offering air transport for the island. Scandinavian Airlines has daily scheduled services to Tromsø and Oslo; there are also irregular charter services to Russia. Lufttransport provides regular corporate charter services from Longyearbyen to Ny-Ålesund Airport, Hamnerabben and Svea Airport for Kings Bay and Store Norske; these flights are in general not available to the public. There are heliports in Barentsburg and Pyramiden, and helicopters are frequently used by the governor and to a lesser extent the mining company Arktikugol.

==Climate==
The climate of Svalbard is dominated by its high latitude, with the average summer temperature at to and January averages at to . The North Atlantic Current moderates Spitsbergens&#x27;s temperatures, particularly during winter, giving it up to higher winter temperature than similar latitudes in Russia and Canada. This keeps the surrounding waters open and navigable most of the year. The interior fjord areas and valleys, sheltered by the mountains, have larger temperature differences than the coast, giving about lower summer temperatures and higher winter temperatures. On the south of Spitsbergen, the temperature is slightly higher than further north and west. During winter, the temperature difference between south and north is typically , while about in summer.

Spitsbergen is the meeting place for cold polar air from the north and mild, wet sea air from the south, creating low pressure and changing weather and fast winds, particularly in winter; in January, a strong breeze is registered 17% of the time at Isfjord Radio, but only 1% of the time in July. In summer, particularly away from land, fog is common, with visibility under registered 20% of the time in July. Precipitation is frequent but falls in small quantities, typically less than annually in western Spitsbergen. More rain falls in the uninhabited east side, where there can be more than annually.

==Nature==

Three terrestrial mammalian species inhabit the island: the Arctic fox, the Svalbard reindeer, and accidentally introduced southern vole, which are only found in Grumant. Attempts to introduce the Arctic hare and the muskox have both failed. There are fifteen to twenty types of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, walruses and polar bears. Arctic charr inhabit Linne´vatn and other freshwater lakes on the island.

Polar bears are the iconic symbol of Spitsbergen and one of the main tourist attractions. While they are protected, persons going outside settlements are required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defence, as a last resort should they attack. Spitsbergen shares a common polar bear population with the rest of Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land. The Svalbard reindeer (&quot;R. tarandus platyrhynchus&quot;) is a distinct sub-species. While it was previously almost extinct, hunting is permitted for both it and the Arctic fox.

About thirty types of bird are found on Spitsbergen, most of which are migratory. The Barents Sea is among the areas in the world with most seabirds, with about 20 million counted during late summer. The most common are little auk, northern fulmar, thick-billed murre and black-legged kittiwake. Sixteen species are on the IUCN Red List. Particularly Storfjorden and Nordvest-Spitsbergen are important breeding ground for seabirds. The Arctic tern has the furthest migration, all the way to Antarctica. Only two songbirds migrate to Spitsbergen to breed: the snow bunting and the northern wheatear. Rock ptarmigan is the only bird to overwinter.
Two partial skeletons of &quot;Pliosaurus funkei&quot; from the Jurassic period were discovered in 2008. It is the largest Mesozoic marine reptile ever found—a pliosaur estimated to be almost long. Svalbard has permafrost and tundra, with both low, middle and high Arctic vegetation. One hundred and sixty-five species of plants have been found on the archipelago. Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetation. Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land, around Isfjorden and where effected by guano. While there is little precipitation, giving the island a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation. The growing season is very short, and may last only a few weeks.

There are six national parks on Spitsbergen: Indre Wijdefjorden, Nordenskiöld Land, Nordre Isfjorden Land, Nordvest-Spitsbergen, Sassen-Bünsow Land and Sør-Spitsbergen. The island also features Festningen Geotope Protected Area; some of the northeastern coast is part of Nordaust-Svalbard Nature Reserve. All human traces dating from before 1946 are automatically protected. Svalbard is on Norway&#x27;s tentative list for nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

<text>Mowgli ( ) is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Mowgli stories featured among Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; stories. He is a feral boy from the Pench area in Seoni, Madhya Pradesh, India, who originally appeared in Kipling&#x27;s short story &quot;In the Rukh&quot; (collected in &quot;Many Inventions&quot;, 1893) and then became the most prominent character in the collections &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and &quot;The Second Jungle Book&quot; (1894–1895), which also featured stories about other characters.

==Name and inspiration==
In the stories, the name Mowgli is said to mean &quot;bald&quot;, describing his lack of fur. Kipling later said &quot;Mowgli is a name I made up. It does not mean &#x27;frog&#x27; in any language that I know of.&quot;

Part of Kipling&#x27;s inspiration for the story of Mowgli is believed to have been William Henry Sleeman&#x27;s account of six cases in India in which wild children had been raised by wolves. That account was first published in the first volume of Sleeman&#x27;s &quot;Journey Through the Kingdom of Oude in 1848-1850&quot; (1858) and reprinted in 1852 as &quot;An Account of Wolves Nurturing Children in Their Dens, by an Indian Official&quot; and in &quot;The Zoologist&quot; (1888 12 (135): 87-98). One most notable feral child was found in the wolf&#x27;s den at the Bulandshahr district in 1867 and subsequently brought to the Sikandra orphanage at Agra, where he was given the name Dina Sanichar.

==Kipling&#x27;s Mowgli stories==
The Mowgli stories, including &quot;In the Rukh&quot;, were first collected in chronological order in one volume as &quot;The Works of Rudyard Kipling Volume VII: The Jungle Book&quot; (1907) (Volume VIII of this series contained the non-Mowgli stories from the Jungle Books), and subsequently in &quot;All the Mowgli Stories&quot; (1933).

&quot;In the Rukh&quot; describes how Gisborne, an English forest ranger in the Pench area in Seoni at the time of the British Raj, discovers a young man named Mowgli, who has extraordinary skills in hunting, tracking, and driving wild animals (with the help of his wolf brothers). He asks him to join the forestry service. Muller, the head of the Department of Woods and Forests of India as well as Gisborne&#x27;s boss, meets Mowgli, checks his elbows and knees, noting the callouses and scars, and figures Mowgli is not using magic or demons, having seen a similar case in 30 years of service. Muller also invites Mowgli to join the service, to which Mowgli agrees. Later, Gisborne learns the reason for Mowgli&#x27;s almost superhuman talents; he was raised by a pack of wolves in the jungle (explaining the scars on his elbows and knees from going on all fours). Mowgli marries the daughter of Gisborne&#x27;s butler, Abdul Gafur, and conceives a son with her.

Kipling then proceeded to write the stories of Mowgli&#x27;s childhood in detail in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, which serves as a prequel to &quot;In the Rukh&quot;. Lost by his parents as a baby in the Indian jungle during a tiger attack, he is adopted by the Wolf Mother, Raksha and Father Wolf, who call him Mowgli (frog) because of his lack of fur and his refusal to sit still. Shere Khan the tiger demands that they give him the baby but the wolves refuse. Mowgli grows up with the pack, hunting with his brother wolves. In the pack, Mowgli learns he is able to stare down any wolf, and his unique ability to remove the painful thorns from the paws of his brothers is deeply appreciated as well.

Bagheera, the black panther, befriends Mowgli because both he and Mowgli have parallel childhood experiences; as Bagheera often mentions, he was &quot;raised in the King&#x27;s cages at Oodeypore&quot; from a cub, and thus knows the ways of man. Baloo the bear, teacher of wolves, has the thankless task of educating Mowgli in &quot;The Law of the Jungle&quot;.

Shere Khan continues to regard Mowgli as fair game, but eventually Mowgli finds a weapon he can use against the tiger – fire. After driving off Shere Khan, Mowgli goes to a human village where he is adopted by Messua and her husband, whose own son Nathoo was also taken by a tiger. It is uncertain if Mowgli is actually the returned Nathoo, although it is stated in &quot;Tiger! Tiger!&quot; that the tiger who carried off Messua&#x27;s son was similar to the one that attacked Mowgli&#x27;s parents. Messua would like to believe that her son has returned, but she herself realises that this is unlikely.

While herding buffalo for the village, Mowgli learns that the tiger is still planning to kill him, so with the aid of two wolves, he traps Shere Khan in a ravine where the buffalo trample him. The tiger dies and Mowgli sets to skin him. After being accused of witchcraft and cast out of the village, Mowgli returns to the jungle with Shere Khan&#x27;s hide and reunites with his wolf family, but it is mentioned that he later becomes married and goes back to the man village.

In later stories in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;&#x27;s sequel, &quot;The Second Jungle Book&quot;, Mowgli learns that the villagers are planning to kill Messua and her husband for harboring him. He rescues them and sends elephants, water buffaloes, and other animals to trample the village and its fields to the ground. Later, Mowgli finds and then discards an ancient treasure (&quot;The King&#x27;s Ankus&quot;), not realising it is so valuable that men would kill to own it. With the aid of Kaa the python, he leads the wolves in a war against the dhole (&quot;Red Dog&quot;).

Finally, Mowgli stumbles across the village where his adopted human mother (Messua) is now living, which forces him to come to terms with his humanity and decide whether to rejoin his fellow humans in &quot;The Spring Running&quot;.

==Play adaptations==
Rudyard Kipling adapted the Mowgli stories for &quot;The Jungle Play&quot; in 1899, but the play was never produced on stage. The manuscript was lost for almost a century. It was published in book form in 2000.

==Influences upon other works==
Only six years after the first publication of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, E. Nesbit&#x27;s &quot;The Wouldbegoods&quot; (1899) included a passage in which some children act out a scene from the book.

Mowgli has been cited as a major influence on Edgar Rice Burroughs who created and developed the character Tarzan. Mowgli was also an influence for a number of other &quot;wild boy&quot; characters.

Poul Anderson and Gordon R. Dickson used the Mowgli stories as the basis for their humorous 1957 science fiction short story &quot;Full Pack (Hokas Wild)&quot;. This is one of a series featuring a teddy bear-like race called Hokas who enjoy human literature but cannot quite grasp the distinction between fact and fiction. In this story, a group of Hokas get hold of a copy of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and begin to act it out, enlisting the help of a human boy to play Mowgli. The boy&#x27;s mother, who is a little bemused to see teddy bears trying to act like wolves, tags along to try to keep him (and the Hokas) out of trouble. The situation is complicated by the arrival of three alien diplomats who just happen to resemble a monkey, a tiger and a snake. This story appears in the collection &quot;Hokas Pokas!&quot; (1998) and is also available online.

==Mowgli stories by other writers==
&quot;The Third Jungle Book&quot; (1992) by Pamela Jekel is a collection of new Mowgli stories in a fairly accurate pastiche of Kipling&#x27;s style.

&quot;Hunting Mowgli&quot; (2001) by Maxim Antinori is a very short novel which describes a fateful meeting between Mowgli and a human hunter.

&quot;The Jungle Book: Last of the Species&quot; (2013) by Mark L. Miller is a series of comic books that tells the story of a female Mowgli who unintentionally started a war between animal tribes after killing Shere Khan to avenge the fallen members of the wolf tribe.

&quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Missionary&quot; (2017) by James Penrice is a novel which describes Mowgli&#x27;s unusual encounter with a missionary.

&quot;Mi Hermano Lobo (My Brother Wolf)&quot; (2020) by Rafael Jaime is a short self published Mexican memoir written in Spanish in which the author details the deep emotional and physical impact Disney&#x27;s animated version of Mowgli had during his lonely early childhood years as a symbolic &quot;surrogate twin brother&quot; figure and role model after learning about his real twin brother&#x27;s death one day after their preterm birth. It also includes an exclusive interview with Diana Santos who voiced the character in the Latin American Spanish dub of the 1967 film. An audiobook version narrated by the author was released on YouTube in September 2021. It is similar in tone to the 2016 documentary &quot;Life, Animated&quot;.

&quot;Feral Dreams: Mowgli and his Mothers&quot; (2020) by Stephen Alter is a novel which describes Mowgli&#x27;s harrowing process in trying to adapt to civilization and his coming of age within the walls of an orphanage located in the Gangetic Plain and run by Miss Cranston, an American missionary who christens him Daniel. At the same time, Mowgli recalls some of his adventures in the jungle prior to his abduction and desperately yearns for his freedom. In this story Mowgli is raised by an elephant matriarch.

==Films, television and radio==
* The 1942 film version starred Sabu as Mowgli.
* Disney&#x27;s 1967 animated musical film version, where he is voiced by Bruce Reitherman, son of the film&#x27;s director Wolfgang Reitherman (David Bailey was originally cast in the role, but his voice changed during production, leading Bailey to not fit the &quot;young innocence of Mowgli&#x27;s character&quot; at which the producers were aiming), and its sequel, &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot; (2003), in which Mowgli is voiced by Haley Joel Osment (Jake Thomas auditioned for the role prior to Osment&#x27;s casting). On three special animated segments for the VHS releases of the &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot; (1996-1998) animated TV series, Mowgli is voiced by Tyler Mullen. In the 2023 short &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot; Mowgli&#x27;s singing voice is provided by Phoenix Reisser.
* Around the same time – from 1967 to 1971 – five Russian short animated films were made by Soyuzmultfilm, collectively known as &quot;Adventures of Mowgli&quot;.
* Of all the various adaptations, Chuck Jones&#x27;s 1977 animated TV short &quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Brothers&quot;, adapting the first story in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, may be the one that adheres most closely to the original plot and dialogue.
* There has also been a Japanese animated TV series &quot;Jungle Book Shonen Mowgli&quot; (where Mowgli is voiced by Urara Takano in the Japanese and Julian Bailey in the English Dub) based on the Mowgli series and the U.S. live-action series &quot;&quot; (where Mowgli is portrayed by Sean Price McConnell).
* There was also a BBC radio adaptation in 1994, starring actress Nisha K. Nayar as Mowgli, Freddie Jones as Baloo and Eartha Kitt as Kaa. It originally aired on BBC Radio 5 (before it became BBC Radio 5 Live and dropped its children&#x27;s programming). Subsequently, it has been released on audio cassette and has been re-run a number of times on digital radio channel BBC 7 (now BBC Radio 4 Extra).
* &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; #83 (1951) contains an adaptation of three Mowgli stories.
* Between 1953 and 1955 Dell Comics featured adaptations of six Mowgli stories in three issues (#487, #582 and #620).
* Some issues of &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; feature adaptations of the Mowgli stories by Gil Kane. These later were collected as an omnibus volume.
* A 1978 live-action sketch titled &quot;The Wonderful World of Ernie&quot; from &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot; which parodied &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)&quot;. Danny Rolnick played Mowgli using a full costume, although lip-synching to Bruce Reitherman&#x27;s original recorded dialogue in the middle of the song.
* A 1994 live-action Disney adaptation titled &quot;Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s The Jungle Book&quot;, directed by Stephen Sommers, which starred Jason Scott Lee as Mowgli. He was also played by Sean Naegeli as a young child at the beginning of the story.
* P. Craig Russell&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Book Stories&quot; (1997) collects three stories, actually adapted from &quot;The Second Jungle Book&quot;, which originally appeared between 1985 and 1996.
* A 1997 live-action direct-to-video film &quot;The Second Jungle Book: Mowgli &amp; Baloo&quot;, which starred Jamie Williams as Mowgli. In this story, the character has no spoken dialogue. 
* In the 1998 live-action Disney adaptation &quot;The Jungle Book: Mowgli&#x27;s Story&quot;, he was played by Brandon Baker. Ryan Taylor also plays a younger version of the character at the beginning of the story. Fred Savage narrates the story off-screen as an adult version of the character.
* A 1998 live-action television film titled &quot;The Jungle Book: Search for the Lost Treasure&quot;, which starred Antonio Baker as Mowgli.
* A 2010 CGI animated TV series made by DQ Entertainment International where Mowgli was voiced by Emma Tate (seasons 1-2) and Sarah Natochenny (season 3).
* A 2016 live-action/CGI hybrid remake of Disney&#x27;s animated version of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; directed by Jon Favreau, which starred newcomer Neel Sethi as Mowgli. Kendrick Reyes also played Mowgli as a toddler during a flashback sequence narrated by Kaa the python. In 2018, Sethi confirmed that he would reprise the role in an upcoming sequel to the film.
* A 2018 live-action adaptation titled &quot;&quot;, directed by Andy Serkis, which starred Rohan Chand as Mowgli.
* A 2024 live-action Mexican independent short film titled &quot;Mi Hermano Lobo (My Brother Wolf)&quot; written and directed by Rafael Jaime and based on his 2020 memoir of the same name, which starred 13-year-old newcomer Héctor Mateo García Díaz Infante as Mowgli. Jaime envisioned Mowgli with an athletic, lean and handsome physical appearance which was based both on Disney&#x27;s animated version of the character created in 1967 as well as French illustrator Marcel Laverdet&#x27;s depiction of the character for a 1999 abridged edition of the original 1894 novel. His warm and kind-hearted personality was based on his first childhood friend, Miguel as well as Matthew Labyorteaux&#x27;s performance as Albert Quinn Ingalls on &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; from 1978 to 1983, Noah Hathaway&#x27;s performance as Atreyu in &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; (1984) and Jeremy Sumpter&#x27;s performance as Peter Pan in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (2003). The character also sings a lullaby titled &quot;Brave Angel&quot; (A cover version of &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot;). The short film was released on YouTube on the United Nations&#x27; International Day of Persons with Disabilities. 
* In 1984–1985, Jonathan Larson and Seth Goldman wrote an ultimately unproduced musical called &quot;Mowgli&quot;.

<doc id="105070" wikidata="Q43229" url="?curid=105070" title="Organization">
<text>An organization or organisation (Commonwealth English; see spelling differences), is an entity—such as a company, or corporation or an institution (formal organization), or an association—comprising one or more people and having a particular purpose.

Organizations may also operate secretly or illegally in the case of secret societies, criminal organizations, and resistance movements. And in some cases may have obstacles from other organizations (e.g.: MLK&#x27;s organization). 

What makes an organization recognized by the government is either filling out incorporation or recognition in the form of either societal pressure (e.g.: Advocacy group), causing concerns (e.g.: Resistance movement) or being considered the spokesperson of a group of people subject to negotiation (e.g.: the Polisario Front being recognized as the sole representative of the Sahrawi people and forming a partially recognized state.)

Compare the concept of social groups, which may include non-organizations.

Organizations and institutions can be synonymous, but Jack Knight writes that organizations are a narrow version of institutions or represent a cluster of institutions; the two are distinct in the sense that organizations &quot;contain&quot; internal institutions (that govern interactions between the members of the organizations).

The word in English is derived from the Spanish &quot;organisation,&quot; which itself is derived from the medieval Latin &quot;organizationem&quot; and its root &quot;organum was&quot; borrowed whole from the Latin word , which means tool or instrument, musical instrument, and organ.

==Types==
There are a variety of legal types of organizations, including corporations, governments, non-governmental organizations, political organizations, international organizations, religious organizations, armed forces, charities, not-for-profit corporations, partnerships, cooperatives, and educational institutions, etc.

A hybrid organization is a body that operates in both the public sector and the private sector simultaneously, fulfilling public duties and developing commercial market activities.

A voluntary association is an organization consisting of volunteers. Such organizations may be able to operate without legal formalities, depending on jurisdiction, including informal clubs or coordinating bodies with a goal in mind which they may express in the form of a manifesto, mission statement, or implicitly through the organization&#x27;s actions.

==Structures==
The study of organizations includes a focus on optimising organizational structure. According to management science, most human organizations fall roughly into four types:
* Committees or juries
* Ecologies
* Matrix organizations
* Pyramids or hierarchies

=== Committees or juries ===
These consist of a group of peers who decide as a group, perhaps by voting. The difference between a jury and a committee is that the members of the committee are usually assigned to perform or lead further actions after the group comes to a decision, whereas members of a jury come to a decision. In common law countries, legal juries render decisions of guilt, liability, and quantify damages; juries are also used in athletic contests, book awards, and similar activities. Sometimes a selection committee functions like a jury. In the Middle Ages, juries in continental Europe were used to determine the law according to consensus among local notables.

Committees are often the most reliable way to make decisions. Condorcet&#x27;s jury theorem proved that if the average member votes better than a roll of dice, then adding more members increases the number of majorities that can come to a correct vote (however correctness is defined). The problem is that if the average member is subsequently &quot;worse&quot; than a roll of dice, the committee&#x27;s decisions grow worse, not better; therefore, staffing is crucial.

Parliamentary procedure, such as Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order, helps prevent committees from engaging in lengthy discussions without reaching decisions.

=== Ecologies ===
This organizational structure promotes internal competition. Inefficient components of the organization starve, while effective ones get more work. Everybody is paid for what they actually do, and so runs a tiny business that has to show a profit, or they are fired.

Companies that utilize this organization type reflect a rather one-sided view of what goes on in ecology. It is also the case that a natural ecosystem has a natural border – ecoregions do not, in general, compete with one another in any way, but are very autonomous.

The pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline talks about functioning as this type of organization in this external article from &quot;The Guardian&quot;.
By:Bastian Batac De Leon.

=== Matrix organization ===

This organizational type assigns each worker two bosses in two different hierarchies. One hierarchy is &quot;functional&quot; and assures that each type of expert in the organization is well-trained, and measured by a boss who is a super-expert in the same field. The other direction is &quot;executive&quot; and tries to get projects completed using the experts. Projects might be organized by products, regions, customer types, or some other schemes.

As an example, a company might have an individual with overall responsibility for products X and Y, and another individual with overall responsibility for engineering, quality control, etc. Therefore, subordinates responsible for quality control of project X will have two reporting lines. The United States aerospace industries were the first to officially use this organizational structure after it emerged in the early 1960s. 

=== Pyramids or hierarchical ===
A hierarchy exemplifies an arrangement with a leader who leads other individual members of the organization. This arrangement is often associated with the basis that there are enough to imagine a real pyramid, if there are not enough stone blocks to hold up the higher ones, gravity would irrevocably bring down the monumental structure. So one can imagine that if the leader does not have the support of his subordinates, the entire structure will collapse. Hierarchies were satirized in &quot;The Peter Principle&quot; (1969), a book that introduced &quot;hierarchiology&quot; and the saying that &quot;in a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.&quot;

==Theories==
In the social sciences, organizations are the object of analysis for a number of disciplines, such as sociology, economics, political science, psychology, management, and organizational communication. The broader analysis of organizations is commonly referred to as organizational structure, organizational studies, organizational behavior, or organization analysis. A number of different perspectives exist, some of which are compatible:
* From a functional perspective, the focus is on how entities like businesses or state authorities are used.
* From an institutional perspective, an organization is viewed as a purposeful structure within a social context.
* From a process-related perspective, an organization is viewed as an entity being (re-)organized, and the focus is on the organization as a set of tasks or actions.

Sociology can be defined as the science of the institutions of modernity; specific institutions serve a function, akin to the individual organs of a coherent body. In the social and political sciences in general, an &quot;organization&quot; may be more loosely understood as the planned, coordinated, and purposeful action of human beings working through collective action to reach a common goal or construct a tangible product. This action is usually framed by formal membership and form (institutional rules). Sociology distinguishes the term organization into planned formal and unplanned informal (i.e. spontaneously formed) organizations. Sociology analyses organizations in the first line from an institutional perspective. In this sense, the organization is an enduring arrangement of elements. These elements and their actions are determined by rules so that a certain task can be fulfilled through a system of coordinated division of labor.

Economic approaches to organizations also take the division of labor as a starting point. The division of labor allows for (economies of) specialization. Increasing specialization necessitates coordination. From an economic point of view, markets and organizations are alternative coordination mechanisms for the execution of transactions.

An organization is defined by the elements that are part of it (who belongs to the organization and who does not?), its communication (which elements communicate and how do they communicate?), its autonomy (which changes are executed autonomously by the organization or its elements?), and its rules of action compared to outside events (what causes an organization to act as a collective actor?).

By coordinated and planned cooperation of the elements, the organization is able to solve tasks that lie beyond the abilities of the single element. The price paid by the elements is the limitation of the degrees of freedom of the elements. Advantages of organizations are enhancement (more of the same), addition (combination of different features), and extension. Disadvantages can be inertness (through coordination) and loss of interaction.

Among the theories that are or have been influential are:

*Activity theory is the major theoretical influence, acknowledged by de Clodomir Santos de Morais in the development of Organization Workshop method. 
*Actor–network theory, an approach to social theory and research, originating in the field of science studies, which treats objects as part of social networks.
*Complexity theory and organizations, the use of complexity theory in the field of strategic management and organizational studies.
*Contingency theory, a class of behavioral theories that claim that there is no best way to organize a corporation, to lead a company, or to make decisions.
*Critical management studies, a loose but extensive grouping of theoretically informed critiques of management, business, and organization, grounded originally in a critical theory perspective
*Economic sociology, studies both the social effects and the social causes of various economic phenomena.
*Enterprise architecture, the conceptual model that defines the coalescence of organizational structure and organizational behavior.
*Garbage Can Model, describes a model which disconnects problems, solutions, and decision-makers from each other.
*Principal–agent problem, concerns the difficulties in motivating one party (the &quot;agent&quot;), to act in the best interests of another (the &quot;principal&quot;) rather than in his or her own interests
*Scientific management (mainly following Frederick W. Taylor), a theory of management that analyses and synthesizes workflows.
*Social entrepreneurship, the process of pursuing innovative solutions to social problems.
*Transaction cost theory, the idea that people begin to organize their production in firms when the transaction cost of coordinating production through the market exchange, given imperfect information, is greater than within the firm.
*Weber&#x27;s Ideal of Bureaucracy (refer to Max Weber&#x27;s chapter on &quot;Bureaucracy&quot; in his book &quot;Economy and Society&quot;)

==Leadership==
A leader in a formal, hierarchical organization, is appointed to a managerial position and has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of his position. However, he must possess adequate personal attributes to match his authority, because authority is only potentially available to him. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However, only the authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in the hierarchy, with commensurate authority.

===Formal organizations===
An organization that is established as a means for achieving defined objectives has been referred to as a formal organization. Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organization. Divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work structure. Thus, the formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard to relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber&#x27;s definition, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority. Each employee receives a salary and enjoys a degree of tenure that safeguards him from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients. The higher his position in the hierarchy, the greater his presumed expertise in adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization. It is this bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position.

===Informal organizations===
In contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the informal organization that underlies the formal structure. The informal organization expresses the personal objectives and goals of the individual . Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization. The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life – the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves.

In prehistoric times, man was preoccupied with his personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival. Now man spends a major portion of his waking hours working for organizations. His need to identify with a community that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging continues unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.

Leaders emerge from within the structure of the informal organization. Their personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures. Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power. Influence is the ability of a person to gain cooperation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger form of influence because it reflects a person&#x27;s ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment.

=== The interplay between formal and informal organizations ===
As most organizations operate through a mix of formal and informal mechanisms, organization science scholars have paid attention to the type of interplay between formal and informal organizations. On the one hand, some have argued that formal and informal organizations operate as substitutes as one type of organization would decrease the advantages of using the other one. For instance, if parties trust each other the use of a formal contract is unnecessary or even detrimental to the relationship. On the other hand, other scholars have suggested that formal and informal organizations can complement each other. For instance, formal mechanisms of control can pave the way for the development of relational norms.

<doc id="105074" wikidata="Q7433865" url="?curid=105074" title="Scientology and law">
<text>The Church of Scientology has been involved in numerous court disputes across the world. In some cases, when the Church has initiated the dispute, questions have been raised as to its motives. The Church of Scientology says that its use of the legal system is necessary to protect its intellectual property and its right to freedom of religion. Critics say that most of the organization&#x27;s legal claims are designed to harass those who criticize it and its manipulative business practices.

In the years since its inception, the Church of Scientology&#x27;s lawsuits have numbered in the thousands—filed against newspapers, magazines, government agencies (including the United States tax collecting unit, the IRS), and many individuals. In 1991, &quot;Time&quot; magazine estimated that the Church spends an average of about $20 million per year on various legal actions, and it is the exclusive client of several law firms. According to a U.S. District Court Memorandum of Decision in 1993, Scientologists &quot;have abused the federal court system by using it, inter alia, to destroy their opponents, rather than to resolve an actual dispute over trademark law or any other legal matter. This constitutes &#x27;extraordinary, malicious, wanton, and oppressive conduct.&#x27; ... It is abundantly clear that plaintiffs sought to harass the individual defendants and destroy the church defendants through massive over-litigation and other highly questionable litigation tactics. The Special Master has never seen a more glaring example of bad faith litigation than this.&quot; Rulings such as this have classified the Church of Scientology as a chronically vexatious litigant. Legal disputes initiated by Scientology against its former members, the media or others include the following:
* Religious discrimination cases, including recognition as a religious organization.
* Copyright infringement cases. Scientology&#x27;s religious documents are copyrighted, and many are available only to members who pay for higher levels of courses and auditing.
* Libel and slander cases.

In the past, the Church has been the defendant in criminal cases (for example, in &quot;United States v. Hubbard&quot;), and increasingly, lawsuits are being brought by former Church members against the Church, such as:
* human trafficking and forced labor (&quot;Claire and Mark Headley v. Church of Scientology International&quot;)
* fraud and misrepresentation
* libel (e.g. &quot;Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto&quot;).

== Litigation for religious recognition ==
One goal of the Church of Scientology is to be recognized as a religion or a tax-free charity, which has met resistance from several governments, with Scientology taking to the courts with varying results. For example, Scientology&#x27;s path to legal recognition as a religion in New Zealand took 48 years and several lawsuits. In 1999, the United Kingdom rejected an application for charity status and the attendant tax benefits. Scientology applied for Canadian tax-exempt status in 1998, was rejected in 1999, and is not registered as a charity as of 2009. In Austria, the organization withdrew its application to register as a &quot;religious confessional community&quot;. Some governments have labeled the church as a cult. German and Belgian government entities have accused Scientology of violating the human rights of its members and therefore called it a &quot;totalitarian cult&quot; and a &quot;commercial enterprise&quot;. In 1995, a parliamentary report in France classified it as a &quot;dangerous cult&quot;. In Russia, the government had refused to consider Scientology for registration as a religious organization, which became the subject of proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights in the case of &quot;Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia&quot;.

==L. Ron Hubbard and lawsuits==
Critics state that the ultimate aim of Scientology lawsuits is to destroy church opponents by forcing them into bankruptcy or submission, using its resources to pursue frivolous lawsuits at considerable cost to defendants. In doing so, they draw particular attention to certain controversial statements made by Scientology founder, L. Ron Hubbard, in the 1950s and 1960s.

In 1994, Scientology attorney Helena Kobrin was fined $17,775 for filing a frivolous lawsuit. U.S. District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema cited a frequently quoted statement of L. Ron Hubbard on the subject in the case of &quot;Religious Technology Center vs. The Washington Post&quot;, on November 28, 1995:

Critics also allege that the Church uses litigation as a cover for intimidation tactics, such as investigating the criminal records (or lack thereof) of opponents and subjecting them to surveillance and invasive inquiries, both to discourage further criticism and to ensure the opponent&#x27;s unwillingness to fight the lawsuit. A policy letter by L. Ron Hubbard, distributed in early 1966, says:
Critics of Scientology cite this passage, among others (such as the widely documented fair game doctrine), to support their contentions that the church uses smear tactics to augment the effectiveness of legal threats.

== Court cases ==

=== Australia ===
=== Canada ===
In &quot;R v Church of Scientology of Toronto&quot; (1992), the Church of Scientology was convicted on two charges of breaching the public trust and fined $250,000, and seven members were convicted on various charges. The case was brought to light after the USA FBI raids in the 1970s on Church of Scientology properties resulted in the discovery of stolen Canadian records, followed by a Canadian raid on the Toronto property and the discovery of 250,000 documents in more than 900 boxes.

In &quot;Hill v Church of Scientology of Toronto&quot; (1995), Justice Casey Hill, at that time a Crown attorney involved in the &quot;R. v. Church of Scientology of Toronto&quot; case, sued and won CAD$1,600,000 for libel, the largest libel damage award in Canadian history. During the case, it was shown that a file had been kept on him as an &quot;Enemy Canada&quot;. In their decision, the Supreme Court of Canada found:
=== France ===
In 1978, L. Ron Hubbard, creator of Scientology, was convicted for illegal business practices, namely, making false claims about his ability to cure physical illnesses. He was sentenced in absentia to four years in prison, which was never served.

In 1996, Jean-Jacques Mazier, then head of the Church of Scientology of Lyons, was convicted of fraud and involuntary homicide, and sentenced to 18 months in prison plus 18 months suspended and fined $100,000. Fourteen of 22 others charged with frauds were also convicted. The manslaughter charge was in connection with the 1988 death of Patrice Vic, who killed himself by jumping from a 12th-floor apartment after being pressured to borrow money to pay for yet another Scientology service. The victim&#x27;s widow said her husband had been &quot;subjected to psychological torture&quot;. Related to this trial, two other scientologists were convicted in Toulon for threatening a psychiatrist and expert witness in the trial.

In 1999, a Marseille court found five senior officials of the Church of Scientology guilty of fraud for &quot;sham purification treatments&quot; in Nice and Marseille. Xavier Delamare was sentenced to two years, partially deferred, and received a fine. Four others received suspended sentences of six months to two years, and two more were found not guilty. In a similar case in Lyons in 1997, six Scientologists had been given suspended prison sentences for fraud.

In 2006, a French parliament report designated the Church of Scientology as a dangerous sect.

In 2009, a case went to trial in France, after a woman claims to have been pressured into paying €21,000 ($29,400) to the Church of Scientology for lessons, books and medicines for her poor mental state, accusing the Church of Scientology of &quot;organised fraud&quot;. Her lawyers argue that the church systematically seeks to make money through mental pressure and use scientifically dubious cures. Coincidentally, a large scale simplification of the laws in France occurred just prior to the beginning of the trial. Suspicion was raised as the new law revision forbids the dissolution of a legal entity, an unadvertised change among hundreds of others. Dissolution was the main sentence requested by the prosecutor against the Church of Scientology in this trial, becoming unlawful as the law changed. On October 27, 2009, a verdict was rendered: six members of the CoS in France, and the Church itself, were convicted of fraud. Four of these, including Alain Rosenberg, were given suspended prison sentences. The Scientology Celebrity Center in Paris, a Scientology bookstore, and all six individual convicts were ordered to pay fines. The plaintiff&#x27;s request for dissolution of the Church was not fulfilled.

=== Netherlands ===
=== Russia ===

On April 5, 2007, the Church of Scientology of Moscow won a judgment against the Russian government establishing its right to recognition as a religious organization. The European Court of Human Rights held that the government&#x27;s refusal of registration &quot;had no lawful basis ... the Moscow authorities did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality vis-à-vis the applicant&#x27;s religious community.&quot;

=== Sweden ===

In 1996, Zenon Panoussis of Sweden published some of the confidential NOTs documents online and the Church of Scientology sued Panoussis for copyright infringement. In his defense, Panoussis used a provision of the Constitution of Sweden that guarantees access to public documents. Panoussis turned over a copy of the NOTs documents to the office of the Swedish Parliament and, by law, copies of all documents (with few exceptions) received by authorities are available for anyone from the public to see, at any time he or she wishes. This, known as the Principle of Public Access (&quot;Offentlighetsprincipen&quot;), is considered a basic civil right in Sweden. The case, however, was decided against Panoussis and he was ordered to pay $164,000 for infringing copyright. The results of the case sparked a legal firestorm in Sweden that debated the necessity of re-writing part of the Constitution.

In 1997, the Church of Scientology engaged Sonny Bono, then a member of the United States House of Representatives who had studied Scientology in the 1970s and 1980s, to pressure US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky to pressure Sweden to change their law permitting free access to any published work regardless of copyright. Along with pressure from Congress, the State Department and the Commerce Department, Sweden agreed to pass tougher copyright protection laws.

=== Switzerland ===

In several cases between 1995 and 2000, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland consistently ruled that the Church of Scientology was a primarily commercial, rather than religious, organization, and in 2003 upheld a decision to force closure of a Scientology-affiliated school.

In 1998, three Scientologists were convicted and jailed on fraud and usury charges after conning a member out of $80,000 for courses.

=== United Kingdom ===
&quot;Hubbard v Vosper&quot; (1972) was a copyright case involving the book &quot;The Mind Benders&quot; authored by Cyril Vosper that contained numerous excerpts from Scientology writings. Using the fair dealing defence, Vosper won his case on appeal.

Bonnie Woods, a former member who began counseling people involved with Scientology and their families, became a target along with her husband Richard in 1993 when the Church of Scientology started a leaflet operation denouncing her as a &quot;hate campaigner&quot; with demonstrators outside their home and around East Grinstead. She and her family were followed by a private investigator, and a creditor of theirs was located and provided free legal assistance to sue them into bankruptcy. After a long battle of libel suits, in 1999 the church agreed in a settlement to issue an apology and pay £55,000 damages and £100,000 costs to the Woods.

=== United States ===
==== Paulette Cooper ====

After writing an article and publishing a book about the Church of Scientology in 1971, journalist Paulette Cooper was sued 19 times as part of the Church&#x27;s Operation Freakout, and almost successfully framed in 1976 for crimes. The plan was foiled when in 1977 the FBI raided several Scientology offices, seizing over 48,000 documents, which detailed the operation against Cooper.

==== Guardian&#x27;s Office convictions ====
In a 1979 criminal case against 11 high-ranking Church officials regarding Operation Snow White, the largest then-known program of domestic espionage in U.S. history, all were convicted.

==== Gerry Armstrong ====

In 1984, the church began a legal battle with Gerry Armstrong that spanned two decades. The church sued Armstrong for providing confidential documents about L. Ron Hubbard to his own attorney. The court found that Armstrong&#x27;s actions were justifiable and affirmed this conclusion in &quot;Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong&quot;. Armstrong settled his counter-claims with the church in December 1986 for $800,000 in exchange for his agreement to keep confidential his experience with the church. The church sued Armstrong for $10.5 million in 1995 and 2002 for allegedly violating the confidentiality agreement in 131 instances. A California appellate court awarded the church $321,923 in damages and $334,671.75 in attorneys fees in 1995, and $500,000 in damages in 2004. The court noted that &quot;Armstrong makes no claim that he has complied, or will ever comply, with the injunction&quot; and that Armstrong claims to now reside in Canada.

==== War with the IRS ====

From the time its tax exemption was removed by the IRS in 1967 to the reinstatement of the tax exemption in 1993, Scientologists filed approximately 2,500 lawsuits against the IRS. Over fifty lawsuits were still active against the IRS in 1993, although these were settled after the church negotiated a tax exemption with the government.

==== Cult Awareness Network ====

The Cult Awareness Network (CAN) was driven into bankruptcy in 1996 in part by a number of Scientology-related lawsuits. As the TV news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; reported in 1997, Scientologists filed over fifty lawsuits against the non-profit organization, which spent over $2 million on its legal defense. After one court handed down a judgment of $1 million against CAN, the organization filed for bankruptcy and auctioned off its assets, which were purchased for $20,000 by a lawyer affiliated with Scientology.

==== &quot;Time&quot; magazine ====

In May 1991, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published a cover story on Scientology entitled &quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot;. The Church responded by suing &quot;Time&quot; and journalist Richard Behar for $400 million; a five-year legal battle ensued in which &quot;Time&quot; spent approximately $7 million defending itself in court. The case was eventually dismissed in the magazine&#x27;s favor. Scientology unsuccessfully sued &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; in Switzerland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany to stop distribution of a condensed version of the &quot;Time&quot; story.

==== Hill &amp; Knowlton and Eli Lilly ====

The PR firm Hill &amp; Knowlton (H&amp;K) was hired by the Church of Scientology in 1987. Right after the devastating &quot;Time&quot; magazine article The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power was published, H&amp;K dropped them as a client. In 1992, the Church of Scientology sued H&amp;K and Eli Lilly for $40 million claiming H&amp;K had illegally terminated the contract because of pressure exerted upon their parent company WPP Group by Eli Lilly, which Scientology had been attacking through its branch group, Citizens Commission on Human Rights. In 1994, after 57,000 pages of discovery and 75 depositions, the parties settled out of court for an undisclosed amount or conditions.

==== Scientology versus the Internet ====

Starting in the 1980s, Scientology filed lawsuits against a number of Internet users, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; newspaper, over fifteen various Internet service providers in The Netherlands, and others concerned in the matter of Karin Spaink, a supporter of Arnie Lerma and other Internet activists who posted on her Web page excerpts from Scientology&#x27;s confidential works. This legal case included claims by Scientology that hyperlinks to alleged copyright infringements were also illegal. Spaink&#x27;s case was taken all the way to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands; however, the Court rejected Scientology&#x27;s claims in their entirety, including the claims regarding hyperlinks.

==== FACTNet ====

In 1998, Scientology sued FACTNet for claimed copyright violations. When federal judge John Kane denied Scientology&#x27;s request for summary judgment because FACTNet challenged Scientology&#x27;s ownership of the copyrights of the documents, a settlement was reached in 1999. The terms were that if FACTNet is ever found guilty of violations of church copyrights, they are permanently enjoined to pay the church $1 million.

==== Lisa McPherson ====

When the Church was charged with a felony count of practicing medicine without a license in the 1996 case involving the death of Scientologist Lisa McPherson, Florida asked for damages of approximately $15,000 to be awarded against the organization. The Church hired law firms and medical specialists at an estimated cost of over $1 million, waging a defense that eventually resulted in the case being dismissed due to lack of credible evidence. On May 29, 2004, the Church paid an undisclosed amount to settle a wrongful death suit brought on behalf of McPherson&#x27;s estate. An article on the suit describes legal attacks made by Scientology&#x27;s attorneys:
==== Larry Wollersheim ====

In the case of &quot;Wollersheim vs. Church of Scientology&quot; (1980), former member Larry Wollersheim sued the organization for mental distress, and was awarded $30 million in damages. On appeal, the award was reduced to $2.5 million. In 1996, Wollersheim was awarded an additional $130,506.71 in attorney&#x27;s fees incurred while defending against a church lawsuit that was dismissed for violating a California law prohibiting strategic lawsuits against public participation. The Church vowed not to pay the award, and the case dragged through the courts for 22 years, including two separate appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States and two additional appeals to the Supreme Court of California. In early 2002, the case was finally settled, with the Church of Scientology paying Larry Wollersheim $8,674,643.

==== Netcom ====

&quot;Religious Technology Center v. Netcom On-Line Communication Services, Inc.&quot; (N.D. Cal. 1995), is a U.S. district court case about whether the operator of a computer bulletin board service (BBS) and Internet access provider that allows that BBS to reach the Internet should be liable for copyright infringement committed by a subscriber of the BBS.

==== Other closed cases ====
; &quot;Religious Technology Center v. Gerbode&quot;
: In &quot;Religious Technology Center v. Gerbode&quot;, 1994 WL 228607 (C.D. Cal. 1994) (against Frank A. Gerbode, inventor of Traumatic Incident Reduction), a Rule 11 sanction of $8,887.50 was imposed against Helena Kobrin, an attorney for the Church, for bringing baseless and frivolous claims.
; &quot;DeCrescenzo v. Church of Scientology International&quot;
: In &quot;DeCrescenzo v. Church of Scientology International,&quot; Laura DeCrescenzo sued the organization in 2009 for forcing her to illegally work 14 hour days at age 12 and coercing her to get an abortion at age 17. In 2018, Scientology settled with DeCrescenzo three weeks before the case went to trial.

; &quot;Garcia Saz et al. v. Church of Scientology Religious Trust et al.&quot;
: In 2013, former Scientology members Luis and Rocio Garcia sued the Church, alleging fraudulent tactics. U.S. District Judge James D. Whittemore granted the Church&#x27;s motion to compel the couple into internal &quot;religious arbitration&quot; per the contracts the Garcias had previously signed with the Church. The Church had not established any rules for how to conduct arbitrations and had never before held such an arbitration. For 2½ years the Church objected to each arbiter the Garcias suggested. Eventually the judge selected three Scientologists at random from a list of 500 provided by the Church and the two-day arbitration was held in 2017. The Garcias were not allowed to have an attorney present, bring witnesses, or record the proceedings, and a Church official removed all but 70 pages of the 900 pages of evidence the Garcias submitted. Their attorney called the arbitration &quot;a sham&quot;. According to an article in the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;, &quot;The panel ultimately refunded the Garcias $18,495 for unused deposits on religious services but did not acknowledge the claims of fraud, misrepresentation or breach of contract.&quot; An appeal by Garcia was unsuccessful.

==== Ongoing litigation ====

As of the end of 2024, the following cases were still open.
; &quot;Chrissie Bixler et al. v. Scientology and Danny Masterson&quot;
: In 2019, plaintiffs Chrissie Carnell Bixler, Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Bobette Riales, and Jane Does #1 and #2 filed a civil suit against actor Danny Masterson for rape, and against the Church of Scientology for systematically stalking them after they went to the police. After a setback when a judge ruled they would have to &quot;take their claims before an ecclesiastical tribunal composed of three Scientologists deemed to be in good standing with the church,&quot; the California Court of Appeal ruled that the plaintiffs could keep arguing their case in court. Meanwhile, Masterson was criminally charged with forcible rape, the parties agreed that discovery in the civil suit should be delayed pending the outcome of the criminal case, and in 2023 Masterson was convicted on two charges of rape. Even though the Church of Scientology wasn&#x27;t a party in the criminal trial, it came to light that the Church had been actively interfering with the criminal case, including harassing the prosecutor as well as the LAPD witnesses. In December 2023, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, adding a sixth complainant, Tricia Vessey, and adding civil RICO claims against the Church of Scientology. Scientology filed anti-SLAPP motions, which the judge denied. Scientology appealed and was granted until March 14, 2025 to file their brief.

; &quot;Valerie Haney v. Scientology&quot;
: After 22 years in Scientology&#x27;s Sea Org, Valerie Haney escaped from Gold Base in 2016 by secretly climbing into the trunk of a visitor&#x27;s car to get out of the compound unnoticed. In 2019, Haney sued Scientology for holding her against her will, libeling her online, and stalking her using private investigators after she left the Church. In 2020, a judge ordered her to &quot;religious arbitration&quot; per contracts she had earlier signed. Unable to come to any agreements about arbiters, in 2023 the judge ordered the parties to get it done. Scientology picked three arbiters, but would not tell Haney or the court their names. The judge denied plaintiff&#x27;s motion to allow an attorney, a court reporter, or even a friend to attend with Haney. Per Haney, &quot;The court is OK with me having to go back to the place where I literally had to escape in the trunk of a car to get out? ... It&#x27;s the worst thing you could probably have a victim do. ... Someone who has been abused her entire life, to go back into the abusive environment with the abusers. It&#x27;s appalling. And absolutely disgusting. It&#x27;s so crazy.&quot; A court date of February 20, 2025 was set to update the court about the arbitration.

; &quot;Baxter, Baxter, and Paris v. Scientology&quot;
: In 2022, Gawain Baxter, his wife Laura Baxter, and Valeska Paris filed suit against the Church of Scientology and David Miscavige alleging six counts of forced labor and peonage in violation of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. Since childhood, all three had been held captive for years on the Scientology ship &quot;Freewinds&quot;, with their passports and identification documents confiscated. Gawain Baxter alleged he was held captive on the ship for 14 more years after he tried to leave the organization at age 15. Valeska Paris alleged she was sexually assaulted in the Sea Org since childhood, but was punished whenever she tried to report the incidents. She spent 11 years working on the ship, and was then sent to Scientology&#x27;s work camp in Australia. Laura Baxter alleged cruel abuse, forced confessions and manual labor. She deliberately got pregnant and refused an abortion in order to be kicked out of the Sea Org. Deliberately evading service, in 2023 after plaintiff&#x27;s lawyers attempted 27 times at multiple sites in California and Florida to serve Miscavige, a judge finally ruled Miscavige as served. On April 3, six weeks after the magistrate ruled Miscavige as served, US District Judge Tom Barber ruled in favor of the first amendment, saying in his order that the plaintiffs must seek relief from Church arbitration and not the courts. Ruling on the case would require the courts to interpret religious doctrine, which is against the first amendment, said Barber.

; &quot;Jane Doe 1 v. Scientology, David Miscavige, and Gavin Potter&quot;
: In December 2022, a Jane Doe filed suit against Scientology leader David Miscavige, recruiter Gavin Potter and three church entities claiming that as a minor the Church enabled one of their recruiters to sexually assault her. After she reported the incident, not only did Scientology fail to report the allegations to police but she was given the ultimatum of going to Scientology&#x27;s prison work camp, the RPF, for five years or marry her abuser. The case alleges Scientology even transported her out of state to Nevada where an underage marriage was possible, and that Scientology officials &quot;knew ... of Gavin Potter&#x27;s unlawful sexual conduct, that he was an unfit agent, and still placed him in a position to solicit young girls into an environment in which sexual assault and battery were commonplace.&quot; Accusing David Miscavige of &quot;service dodging&quot;, Judge Broadbelt ruled in February 2024 that the plaintiff must exhaust all options before being allowed to serve Miscavige by publication. On April 15, 2024, Judge Broadbelt posted a tentative ruling in favor of the plaintiff when he found Scientology&#x27;s religious arbitration contract &quot;unconscionable&quot;. The following morning, Miscavige—effectively accepting service in the case for the first time—sent his lawyer to the courthouse to file a peremptory challenge to disqualify the judge, causing Broadbelt to step aside. Scientology requested to depose Jane Doe 1 and a lawyer involved in a prior lawsuit connected to her; a hearing was set for January 9, 2025.
; &quot;Leah Remini v. Scientology&quot;
: In 2023, Leah Remini filed a lawsuit against the Church of Scientology and David Miscavige claiming defamation, harassment, stalking and tortious interference with a contractual relationship (Remini&#x27;s business relationships), seeking compensatory and punitive damages for economic and psychological harm. Remini claimed she had been stalked, surveilled, harassed, threatened, intimidated, and subjected to intentionally malicious and fraudulent rumors. Remini&#x27;s family and friends had also been subjected to the harassment, and in 2015 Remini hired bodyguards fearing for her physical safety. &quot;For 17 years, Scientology and David Miscavige have subjected me to what I believe to be psychological torture, defamation, surveillance, harassment, and intimidation, significantly impacting my life and career&quot;, Remini said.In January 2024, the lawsuit survived an anti-SLAPP motion by the Church of Scientology, though the judge removed some of the defamation claims which occurred prior to the one-year statute of limitations, kept some, where the defendants published false claims &quot;with at least a reckless disregard of the facts&quot;, and rejected Scientology&#x27;s argument that their early surveillance of Remini was a &quot;pre-litigation stance&quot;. Both parties appealed the ruling. Accused of &quot;service dodging&quot;, in February 2024 judge Hammock told David Miscavige&#x27;s lawyer, &quot;He should just appear, and defend himself.&quot;

<doc id="105075" wikidata="Q4116106" url="?curid=105075" title="Parallel processing (psychology)">
<text>In psychology, parallel processing is the ability of the brain to simultaneously process incoming stimuli of differing quality. Parallel processing is associated with the visual system in that the brain divides what it sees into four components: color, motion, shape, and depth. These are individually analyzed and then compared to stored memories, which helps the brain identify what you are viewing. The brain then combines all of these into the field of view that is then seen and comprehended. This is a continual and seamless operation. For example, if one is standing between two different groups of people who are simultaneously carrying on two different conversations, one may be able to pick up only some information of both conversations at the same time. Parallel processing has been linked, by some experimental psychologists, to the stroop effect (resulting from the stroop test where there is a mismatch between the name of a color and the color that the word is written in). In the stroop effect, an inability to attend to all stimuli is seen through people&#x27;s selective attention.

== Background ==
In 1990, American Psychologist David Rumelhart proposed the model of parallel distributed processing (PDP) in hopes of studying neural processes through computer simulations. According to Rumelhart, the PDP model represents information processing as interactions between elements called units, with the interactions being either excitatory or inhibitory in nature. Parallel Distributed Processing Models are neurally inspired, emulating the organisational structure of nervous systems of living organisms. A general mathematical framework is provided for them.

Parallel processing models assume that information is represented in the brain using patterns of activation. Information processing encompasses the interactions of neuron-like units linked by synapse-like connections. These can be either excitatory or inhibitory. Every individual unit&#x27;s activation level is updated using a function of connection strengths and activation level of other units. A set of response units is activated by the propagation of activation patterns. The connection weights are eventually adjusted using learning.

=== Serial vs parallel processing ===
In contrast to parallel processing, serial processing involves sequential processing of information, without any overlap of processing times. The distinction between these two processing models is most observed during visual stimuli is targeted and processed (also called visual search).

==== Visual search ====
In case of serial processing, the elements are searched one after the other in a serial order to find the target. When the target is found, the search terminates. Alternatively, it continues to the end to ensure that the target is not present. This results in reduced accuracy and increased time for displays with more objects.

On the other hand, in the case of parallel processing, all objects are processed simultaneously but the completion times may vary. This may or may not reduce the accuracy, but the time courses are similar irrespective of the size of the display.

However, there are concerns about the efficiency of parallel processing models in case of complex tasks which are discussed ahead in this article.

== Aspects of a parallel distributed processing model ==
There are eight major aspects of a parallel distributed processing model:

=== Processing units ===
These units may include abstract elements such as features, shapes and words, and are generally categorised into three types: input, output and hidden units.

* Input units receive signals from either sensory stimuli or other parts of the processing system.
* The output units send signals out of the system.
* The hidden units function entirely inside the system.

=== Activation state ===
This is a representation of the state of the system. The pattern of activation is represented using a vector of N real numbers, over the set of processing units. It is this pattern that captures what the system is representing at any time.

=== Output functions ===
An output function maps the current state of activation to an output signal. The units interact with their neighbouring units by transmitting signals. The strengths of these signals are determined by their degree of activation. This in turn affects the degree to which they affect their neighbours.

=== Connectivity patterns ===
The pattern of connectivity determines how the system will react to an arbitrary input. The total pattern of connectivity is represented by specifying the weights for every connection. A positive weight represents an excitatory input and a negative weight represents an inhibitory input.

=== Propagation rule ===
A &quot;net input&quot; is produced for each type of input using rules that take the output vector and combine it with the connectivity matrices. In the case of a more complex pattern connectivity, the rules are more complex too.

=== Activation rule ===
A new state of activation is produced for every unit by joining the &quot;net inputs&quot; of impinging units combined and the current state of activation for that unit.

=== Learning rule ===
The patterns of connectivity are modified using experience. The modifications can be of three types: First, the development of new connections. Second, the loss of existing connection. Last, the modification of strengths of connections that already exist. The first two can be considered as special cases of the last one. When the strength of a connection is changed from zero to a positive or negative one, it is like forming a new connection. When the strength of a connection is changed to zero, it is like losing an existing connection.

=== Environmental representation ===
In PDP models, the environment is represented as a &quot;time-varying stochastic function&quot; over the space of input patterns. This means that at any given point, there is a possibility that any of the possible set of input patterns is impinging on the input units.  

An example of the PDP model is illustrated in Rumelhart&#x27;s book &#x27;Parallel Distributed Processing&#x27; of individuals who live in the same neighborhood and are part of different gangs. Other information is also included, such as their names, age group, marital status, and occupations within their respective gangs. Rumelhart considered each category as a &#x27;unit&#x27; and an individual has connections with each unit. For instance, if more information is sought on an individual named Ralph, that name unit is activated, revealing connections to the other properties of Ralph such as his marital status or age group.

== Depth ==
To sense depth, humans use both eyes to see three dimensional objects. This sense is present at birth in humans and some animals, such as cats, dogs, owls, and monkeys. Animals with wider-set eyes have a harder time establishing depth, such as horses and cows. A special depth test was used on infants, named The Visual Cliff. This test consisted of a table, half coated in a checkerboard pattern, and the other half a clear plexiglass sheet, revealing a second checkerboard platform about a foot below. Although the plexiglass was safe to climb on, the infants refused to cross over due to the perception of a visual cliff. This test proved that most infants already have a good sense of depth. This phenomenon is similar to how adults perceive heights.

Certain cues help establish depth perception. Binocular cues are made by humans&#x27; two eyes, which are subconsciously compared to calculate distance. This idea of two separate images is used by 3-D and VR filmmakers to give two dimensional footage the element of depth. Monocular cues can be used by a single eye with hints from the environment. These hints include relative height, relative size, linear perspective, lights and shadows, and relative motion. Each hint helps to establish small facts about a scene that work together to form a perception of depth. Binocular cues and monocular cues are used constantly and subconsciously to sense depth.

== Limitations ==
Limitations of parallel processing have been brought up in several analytical studies. The main limitations highlighted include capacity limits of the brain, attentional blink rate interferences, limited processing capabilities, and information limitations in visual searches.

There are processing limits to the brain in the execution of complex tasks like object recognition. All parts of the brain cannot process at full capacity in a parallel method. Attention controls the allocation of resources to the tasks. To work efficiently, attention must be guided from object to object.

These limits to attentional resources sometimes lead to &quot;serial bottlenecks&quot; in parallel processing, meaning that parallel processing is obstructed by serial processing in between. However, there is evidence for coexistence of serial and parallel processes.

=== Feature integration theory ===
The feature integration theory by Anne Treisman is one of the theories that integrates serial and parallel processing while taking into account attentional resources. It consists of two stages-

# &quot;Detection of features-&quot; This stage occurs instantaneously and uses parallel processing. In this step, all the basic features of a display are picked up simultaneously, even if attention is being paid to a specific object.
# &quot;Integration of features-&quot; This step is more time-consuming and uses serial processing. It leads to the perception of whole objects and patterns.

<text>Eva is a town in Morgan County, Alabama, United States, and is included in the Decatur Metropolitan Area and the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the town was 589, up from 519 in 2010. The mayor currently is Gary Livingston.

==History==

Originally called &quot;Cowhead&quot;, the town began to be settled in 1820, just a year after Alabama achieved statehood. William J. Rook began a post office in Cowhead in 1883; however, it was closed a month later. According to local lore, at a community meeting, the town received its current name &quot;Eva&quot; in October 1883 at the suggestion of a local physician, Dr. Lewis Keller, who had just delivered a beautiful baby girl by that name, Eva Brandon. He liked that name because like the girl, the town was just getting started. After discussion, the community agreed upon the name Eva because the town needed a new name as a prerequisite for establishing a new post office. It was not until 1887 that the town&#x27;s name was officially changed from Cowhead.

In 1916, Mr. Wiley Steward, local sawmill owner, donated of land to the town, for the construction of a new school. In 1918, using donations from the local community, Eva gazed with admiration upon a beautiful new four-room schoolhouse. As time went by, the need for higher educational training for the community was realized. In an effort spearheaded by local physician J. G. Daves, later deemed &quot;the father of Eva School&quot;, in the 1920s a community campaign was set forth to raise the necessary funds to build another school. Even the Great Depression could not hold this thriving community down from its dream of higher education for its children.

It was a community undertaking, but the fairy tale dream of a resolute community was realized in 1930, when Eva became a proud possessor of an accredited high school and held graduation exercises with a senior class composed of three members.

The community forged ahead and in its desire to add to the curriculum of the school, through local donations, added a vocational agriculture building, elementary building, and in 1938 completed a large stone gymnasium.

In 1972, with the opening of Albert P. Brewer High School in Florette, Eva High School was consolidated into this new east regional Morgan County High School facility.

In 1996, the Morgan County Board of Education, through a capital funds campus upgrade, demolished the old school buildings, excluding the gymnasium that was constructed in 1985 and the old lunchroom building, constructed in the mid 1960s. The campus was rebuilt, with a beautiful new modern K-8 building. Today, Eva School, as it has done for a century, continues to serve as source of pride for the Eva community.

Eva incorporated as a town in 1963.

==Geography==
Eva is located in southeastern Morgan County at (34.325209, -86.747722). Its southern border touches the border with Cullman County. It is southeast of Hartselle and south-southeast of Decatur, the Morgan county seat. Cullman is to the southwest, and Arab is to the east.

The town center, at an elevation of above sea level, is just north of the Tennessee Valley Divide. The town drains west toward Flint Creek and east toward Cotaco Creek, both of which are north-flowing tributaries of the Tennessee River. The southernmost parts of town drain south to Eightmile Creek, a tributary of the Broglen River and part of the Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River watershed.

<text>Marion is a city in and the county seat of Perry County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city is 3,686, up 4.8% over 2000. First known as Muckle Ridge, the city was renamed for a hero of the American Revolution, Francis Marion.

Two colleges, Judson College (Alabama) and Marion Military Institute, are located in Marion. This is noted in the city&#x27;s welcome sign referring to Marion as &quot;The College City&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
Formerly the territory of the Creek Indians, Marion was founded shortly after 1819 as Muckle Ridge. In 1822 the city was renamed in honor of Francis Marion, the &quot;Swamp Fox,&quot; hero of the American Revolutionary War. Marion incorporated as a town the same year and later became Perry County&#x27;s second county seat as the hamlet of Perry Ridge was deemed unsuitable. In 1829 it upgraded from a town to a city. The old City Hall (1832) is but one of many antebellum public buildings, churches, and homes in the city today.

General Sam Houston, while between terms as 1st and 3rd president of the Republic of Texas, married Margaret Lea of Marion in the city in 1840.

At the 1844 meeting of the Alabama Baptist State Convention in Marion, the &quot;Alabama Resolutions&quot; were passed. This was one of the factors that led to the 1845 formation of the Southern Baptist Convention in Augusta, Georgia.

===Founding of colleges===
Judson College, a private, Baptist college for women, was founded in 1838 and closed July 31, 2021. Marion Military Institute was founded in 1887. Howard College, initially the location of the current Marion Military Institute, was founded in Marion in 1841, and moved to Birmingham in 1887, later becoming Samford University. A groundbreaking school for African Americans, the Lincoln Normal School, was founded here in 1867. The associated Lincoln Normal University for Teachers moved to Montgomery and became Alabama State University. In 1889, Marion Military Institute was chartered by the State of Alabama and today is the oldest military junior college in the nation.

===Pre-Civil War===
In December 1857, Andrew Barry Moore (1807–1873) of Marion was elected the sixteenth governor of Alabama (1857–1861). He served one term, presiding over Alabama&#x27;s secession from the Union. Assisting in the war effort, Moore was imprisoned a short time after the war and in ill health returned to Marion, where he died eight years later. George Doherty Johnson (May 30, 1832 – December 8, 1910) served as mayor of Marion in 1856, state legislator from 1857 to 1858 and rose to the rank of brigadier general in the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War.

===Civil War era===
Nicola Marschall (1829–1917), a German-American artist, is generally credited with designing both the first official Confederate flag and the grey Confederate army uniform while a teacher at the old Marion Female Seminary. With the coming Civil War in 1861, Nicola Marschall was approached in February by Mary Clay Lockett, wife of prominent attorney Napoleon Lockett of Marion, and her daughter, Fannie Lockett Moore, daughter-in-law of Alabama Governor Andrew B. Moore of Marion, to design a flag for the new Confederacy. Marschall offered three designs, one of which became the &quot;Stars and Bars,&quot; the first official flag of the Confederate States of America (C.S.A.), first raised in Montgomery, Alabama, on March 4, 1861.

===Early 20th century===
At the turn of the century in 1900, Perry County peaked in population at 31,783. This is three times the population of the county in the 2010 census.

Hal Kemp, a jazz alto saxophonist, clarinetist, bandleader, composer and arranger was born in Marion in 1904 and died in Madera, California, following an auto accident in 1940. His band was very popular from 1934 until 1939. Major recordings in 1936 include 
&quot;There&#x27;s a Small Hotel&quot; and &quot;When I&#x27;m With You&quot; both number one hits for two weeks. In 1937, his number one hits were &quot;This Year&#x27;s Kisses&quot;, which was number one for four weeks, and &quot;Where or When&quot;, number one for one week. Other noted recordings were &quot;Got a Date With an Angel&quot; and &quot;Three Little Fishies&quot;. In 1992, Hal Kemp was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.

Coretta Scott King, wife of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., was born in Marion in 1927 and spent her childhood there. She graduated from Lincoln Normal School as valedictorian in 1945. The couple got married on the front lawn of her mother&#x27;s home north of Marion in 1953.

===Civil Rights era===
A number of significant events occurred in Marion relating to the Civil Rights Movement. In 1958 Jimmy Wilson, a black man, was sentenced to death by a jury in Marion for stealing $1.95 from Estelle Barker. Wilson&#x27;s case became an international cause célèbre, covered in newspapers worldwide and inspiring over 1000 letters per day to the office of governor Jim Folsom. Finally, after the Alabama Supreme Court upheld Wilson&#x27;s conviction, at the urging of the Congress of Racial Equality, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles wrote to Folsom explaining the damage that the case was doing to the international reputation of the United States and Folsom quickly granted Wilson clemency.

In 1964, Marion was a center of civil rights protests in Alabama. During a Southern Christian Leadership Conference march on the evening of February 18, 1965, during the height of the Selma Voting Rights Movement, Marion resident Jimmie Lee Jackson was shot and killed by Alabama State Trooper James Bonard Fowler. These events were depicted in the movie &quot;Selma&quot;, released in 2014. Jackson died on February 26 of an infection stemming from his wounds at nearby Good Samaritan Hospital in Selma. Martin Luther King Jr. preached a sermon at Jackson&#x27;s funeral on March 3, and Jackson&#x27;s death is recognized as the catalyst for James Bevel to call and organize the first Selma to Montgomery March on March 7. It was not until 2007 that Fowler was indicted for murder for his role in Jackson&#x27;s death. In 2010, Fowler pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter.

In 2018, the US Department of the Interior granted Beyond 50 Years – a community non-profit group in Marion – a $500,000.00 grant to convert the historic Perry County Jailhouse into a voting rights museum. The historic jailhouse was the location of Reverend James Orange&#x27;s incarceration, which sparked the 1965 march that resulted in the death of Jimmie Lee Jackson. The jail is currently under renovation for the conversion into a museum, however a grand opening date has not yet been announced.

===Recent events===
In 2009, Marion made national news when a three-year-old family feud turned into a 150-man riot outside the town&#x27;s city hall resulting in the arrest of eight people and the hospitalization of two.

In early 2016, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported the city was the center of an outbreak of tuberculosis. In 2014–15 twenty people in the area had contracted active cases of the disease and three had died.

<text>Uniontown is a city in Perry County, Alabama, in west-central Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city is 2,107, up 18.7% over 2010. Of the 573 cities in Alabama, Uniontown is the 207th most populous.

Uniontown has four sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Fairhope Plantation, Pitts&#x27; Folly, the Uniontown Historic District, and Westwood.

==History==
First settled in 1818, the area that would become Uniontown was initially called Woodville after the first family settling there; the town was incorporated on December 23, 1836. Woodville was the terminus of one of the earliest plank roads (a road paved with wooden planks) in the state, which was constructed in 1848 and connected Woodville with Demopolis. The Alabama and Mississippi Railroad came through the town in 1857.

By 1860, the town had grown enough to support educational facilities for both boys and girls. In addition to the schools, the town had a number of businesses on its main street, including two department stores, and the town&#x27;s economy was tied closely to the surrounding plantations. The town became known as Uniontown in 1861 at the suggestion of a local planter, Philip Weaver, whose hometown was Uniontown, Maryland. Uniontown sent a number of men to fight with the Canebrake Rifle Guards during the Civil War, a unit named after the geographical region in which Uniontown is located, as well as in another unit known as the Independent Troop of Uniontown. The area remained tied to the agricultural economy after the war.

In 1897, the Uniontown Cotton Oil Company was established in the town, one of the first facilities of its kind in the state and one of the first industrial businesses in Perry County; it manufactured cotton seed oil and cottonseed meal.

By 1900, the town had cotton gins, cotton warehouses, and a cotton mill. The city also had electricity and telephone services by this time. Less than two decades later, however, Uniontown began to lose population as more people abandoned plantations, largely because of the boll weevil&#x27;s ruinous effect on the cotton crop. The town remains largely dependent on agricultural activities, including livestock farming, in the surrounding area.

After a 2008 spill of hazardous coal ash in Tennessee, four million cubic yards of the ash was moved to the Arrowhead Landfill in Uniontown. That facility is licensed to accept toxic waste from 33 state.

==Geography==
Uniontown is located at (32.448984, -87.512287).

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , land and water.

<text>Aliceville is a city in Pickens County, Alabama, United States, located thirty-six miles west of Tuscaloosa. At the 2010 census its population was 2,486, down from 2,567 in 2000. Founded in the first decade of the 20th century and incorporated in 1907, the city has become notable for its World War II-era prisoner-of-war camp, Camp Aliceville. Since 1930, it has been the largest municipality in Pickens County.

==History==

In 1902 the settlement that would become Aliceville was founded with the opening of a single store. The city was named in honor of the wife of John T. Cochrane, founder of the Alabama, Tennessee and Northern Railroad and moving force behind the construction of the short line from Carrollton, Alabama to Aliceville. Within two years of the completion of the short line, Aliceville had grown to what the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; called in 1905 &quot;a town of considerable pretensions. There are about a dozen stores, a bank, public buildings and numerous enterprises.&quot;

In 1907 an election was scheduled to allow the citizens of Aliceville to decide whether their community should be incorporated. Incorporation was approved by the voters, and on March 19, 1907, a municipal election was held to choose municipal officers, including a mayor and five aldermen: T.H. Sommerville, J.M. Summerville, A. Hood, J.D. Sanders, W.E. Stringfellow, and J.B. Cunningham, respectively.

In August 1907 a black man named Gibson was lynched in Aliceville, which caused civil disturbances in the community. Rumors swirled that &quot;the negroes were arming themselves,&quot; and a group of blacks on horseback were fired on in the street. Gibson&#x27;s father was subsequently &quot;ordered to leave the county on account of some impertient (sic) talk.&quot;

By March 1908, municipal officials had decreed that all streets should have ten-foot sidewalks built on both sides. Property owners were to be responsible for building the sidewalks in front of their parcels. This work, along with the paving of the streets, was largely completed by June 1910 and the city began considering the installation of water and electricity.

===Camp Aliceville===

During World War II, a Prisoner-of-war camp was set up in Aliceville to hold 6,000 German prisoners, most from the Afrika Korps, although the population of the camp rarely exceeded 3,500. The camp operated between June 2, 1943 and September 30, 1945. Prisoners were brought to the camp via the St. Louis – San Francisco Railway.

The only remaining trace of the camp is an old stone chimney. However, there is a German POW collection at the Aliceville Museum and Cultural Arts Center which retains documentation from the camp including maps, photographs, camp publications, letters, and artwork.
===Civil rights movement===

====1960====
During the civil rights movement, organizing in small communities such as Aliceville was often more dangerous for activists than it was in larger cities because of their isolation. As late as 1965, according to James Corder, a Primitive Baptist minister from Aliceville, Pickens County had not yet experienced any civil unrest related to the movement. Jordan was inspired by the Selma to Montgomery marches in March of that year to organize a civil rights group in Aliceville, which he called the &quot;Rural Farm and Development Council&quot; in order to avoid scrutiny. The group organized protests at the Aliceville city hall to oppose officially sanctioned racism in the city.

In September 1969 black students held protests against the principal of an all-black school in Aliceville, prompting governor Albert Brewer to send National Guard troops into the city. Two of the city&#x27;s all-black schools were closed on September 4 due to the demonstrations, and they reopened the next day under National Guard supervision.

====1970s and 1980s====
In 1982, Aliceville native Maggie Bozeman testified at Congressional hearings held in Montgomery, Alabama, concerning proposed amendments to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. She testified that as late as 1980 in Aliceville and Pickens County voting took place in the open rather than in private booths and that white police officers were stationed in polling places, taking photographs of people who assisted black voters. This revelation outraged Republican congressman Henry Hyde, who had previously been unconvinced of the necessity of amending the law.

Bozeman&#x27;s testimony followed her 1979 arrest, conviction, and sentencing for vote fraud. Bozeman and fellow political activist Julia Wilder of Olney, Alabama were given &quot;the sternest sentences for a vote fraud conviction in recent Alabama history&quot;: five years for Wilder and four for Bozeman. The sentences were upheld on appeal, prompting the formation of an organization, the National Coalition to Free Julia Wilder and Maggie Bozeman and Save the Voting Rights Act, and a march through Aliceville from Carrollton, Alabama, to Montgomery to publicize their cause.

The United States Department of Justice sent eight poll-watchers to Aliceville to observe the 1984 primary election runoffs following reports from observers of the July 1984 main primaries.

===And after===
In November 2013 three tanker cars carrying crude oil exploded when an Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway train derailed near Aliceville. As of March 2014, the cleanup of the spilt oil was still not complete, despite four months of work. About 750,000 gallons of Bakken crude was released.

The courthouse square was used frequently as a site for public lynchings by whites of African Americans, part of numerous efforts to suppress them during a time of high tensions as whites struggled for dominance. It was part of a program of intimidation and racial terrorism, with these murders frequent in the decades on either side of the turn of the 20th century. Among the numerous African Americans lynched in Carrollton was John Gibson, hanged on August 28, 1907. Pickens County had the fifth highest total of lynchings in Alabama, according to &quot;Lynching in America&quot; (2015, 3rd edition), published by the Equal Justice Initiative.
