<text>Duisburg (; , ) is a city in the Ruhr metropolitan area of the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Lying on the confluence of the Rhine (Lower Rhine) and the Ruhr rivers in the center of the Rhine-Ruhr Region, Duisburg is the 5th largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia and the 15th-largest city in Germany.

In the Middle Ages, it was a city-state and a member of the Hanseatic League, and later became a major centre of the iron, steel, and chemicals industries. For this reason, it was heavily bombed in World War II. Today it boasts the world&#x27;s largest inland port, with 21 docks and 40 kilometres of wharf.

==Status==
Duisburg is a city in Germany&#x27;s Rhineland, the fifth-largest city (after Cologne, Düsseldorf, Dortmund and Essen) in the nation&#x27;s most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Its 500,000 inhabitants make it Germany&#x27;s 15th-largest city. Located at the confluence of the Rhine river and its tributary the Ruhr river, it lies in the west of the Ruhr urban area, Germany&#x27;s largest, of which it is the third-largest city after Dortmund and Essen. The Ruhr itself lies within the larger Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region, one of Europe&#x27;s largest conurbations. The city lies on both sides of the Rhine, with the city centre and most boroughs on the river&#x27;s right bank, and is the only city of the Rhine-Ruhr region lying on both the Rhine and Ruhr rivers. Duisburg is one of the largest cities in the Meuse-Rhenish (closely related to Dutch) dialect area and the largest in the Kleverlandish area (north of the Uerdingen Isogloss).

Duisburg has the world&#x27;s largest inland port, &quot;Duisburg-Ruhrorter Häfen&quot;, in Duisburg-Ruhrort. Germany&#x27;s third-largest and the Rhine-Ruhr region&#x27;s main airport, Düsseldorf Airport, lies near the city, in Düsseldorf-Lohausen. With 42,747 students, the University of Duisburg-Essen is Germany&#x27;s ninth-largest university. It has campuses in Essen and Duisburg, and a university hospital in Essen. Duisburg is a result of numerous incorporations of surrounding towns and smaller cities. The city is renowned for its steel industry. All blast furnaces in the Ruhr are now located in Duisburg. In 2000, 49% of all hot metal and 34.4% of all pig iron in Germany were produced here. It also has a large brewery, König. In the early Middle Ages, it was a royal court of the Franks, first mentioned in writing in 883.

In the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia, Duisburg is divided between three constituencies: 61 Duisburg I (containing Süd district and most of Mitte), 62 Duisburg II (Walsum, Rheinhausen, and most of Homberg/Ruhrort/Baerl), and 63 Duisburg III (Hamborn, Meiderich/Beeck, and parts of Mitte and Homberg/Ruhrort/Baerl). After the 2022 North Rhine-Westphalia state election, all three constituencies were held by the SPD. Duisburg I was represented by Sarah Philipp, Duisburg II by Rainer Bischoff, and Duisburg III by Frank Börner.

=== Federal parliament ===
In the Bundestag, Duisburg is divided between two constituencies: 115 Duisburg I (Rheinhausen, Süd, and Mitte) and 116 Duisburg II (Walsum, Hamborn, Meidereich/Beeck, Homberg/Ruhrort/Baerl). In the 20th Bundestag, both are held by the SPD. Duisburg I is represented by President of the Bundestag Bärbel Bas, and Duisburg II by Mahmut Özdemir.

== History ==

The first syllable of the name of the city could go back to the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*dʰeus-&quot;, meaning something like &quot;wet area&quot; or &quot;flood plain&quot;. Duisburg therefore could mean &quot;fortified place in the floodplain&quot;. Another interpretation assumes that the name is derived from the Old German &quot;duis&quot; which means &quot;hill&quot;. Duisburg could mean something like &quot;castle on the hill&quot;. Thus, a place on a hill overlooking the Rhine, that could refer to the area of the present Town Hall. Duisburggau (Diuspurgau) was also the name of the medieval Gau (country subdivision) on the Lower Rhine.

A legend recorded by Johannes Aventinus (fl. 1525) holds that Duisburg (along with Deutz, Cologne, Duisdorf in Bonn, and Doesburg in the Netherlands, all on the Rhine&#x27;s right bank) was built by the namesake Tuisto, mythical progenitor of Germans, about . There is nothing to establish any historical basis for such an early founding of Duisburg, which would have made it among the earliest cities in Europe.

=== Roman period ===
Latest archaeological studies show that the present-day market-place was already in use in the first century. It has been the major central trading place of the city since the 5th century. The city itself was located at the &quot;Hellweg&quot;, an important medieval trade route, and at a ford across the Rhine. The Romans already guarded the ford.
* 420: The Franks usurp the Roman settlement and recolonize the old part of the town.
* 883: The Normans conquer Duisburg and stay for the winter. First historic document mentioning Duisburg.

=== Middle Ages ===
Due to the town&#x27;s favorable geographic position a palatinate was built and the town was soon granted the royal charter of a free city. Duisburg became a member of the Hanseatic League. Around 1000 the river Rhine moved westward from the city. This put an end to the city&#x27;s development as a trading town and it soon grew into a quiet rural city.

The productions of cartographer Gerardus Mercator and the foundation of a university in 1655 established the city&#x27;s renown as &quot;Educated Duisburg&quot; (&quot;Duisburgum Doctum&quot;).
*1120: construction of the city wall
* 1279: &quot;city charter&quot; granted by King Lothar III
* 1290 Duisburg becomes part of the County (after 1417 Duchy) of Cleves
* 1445 attack by Archbishop-Elector Dietrich II von Moers (de) of Cologne was thwarted
* 1566 Johannes Corputius completes his city map of Duisburg.
* 1666 Duisburg within the Duchy of Cleves becomes a part of Brandenburg-Prussia

=== Industrial revolution ===
The rise of tobacco and textile industries in the 18th century made Duisburg an industrial center. Big industrial companies such as iron and steel producing firms (Thyssen and Krupp) influenced the development of the city within the Prussian Rhine Province.
Large housing areas near production sites were being built as workers and their families moved in.
* 1823 a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) Duisburg is established including the cities of Essen and Mülheim an der Ruhr.
* 1824 construction of the sulfuric acid factory Fr. W. Curtius; beginning of the industry age in Duisburg.
* 1828 Franz Haniel builds a dockyard for steamships
* 1846 railway line to Düsseldorf
* 1847 railway line via Dortmund to Minden
* 1873 Duisburg becomes an independent city borough.
* 1904 Birth of the 100,000th resident (Ernst R. Straube)
* 1921 French Infantry occupy the city on 8 March to secure war reparation payments incurred during World War I.
* 1929 The city of Hamborn and Duisburg are joined together. The new city is given the name of Duisburg-Hamborn.
* 1935 Duisburg-Hamborn is renamed Duisburg.
* 1938 (November) The Nazis destroy the city&#x27;s synagogue.

=== World War II ===

A major logistical center in the Ruhr and location of chemical, steel and iron industries, Duisburg was a primary target of Allied bombers. As such, it is considered by some historians to be the single most heavily bombed German city by the Allies during World War II, with industrial areas and residential blocks targeted by Allied incendiary bombs.

On the night of 12–13 June 1941, British bombers dropped a total of 445 tons of bombs in and around Duisburg. As part of the Battle of the Ruhr, another British raid of 577 bombers destroyed the old city between 12 and 13 May 1943 with 1,599 tons of bombs. During the bombing raids, 96,000 people were made homeless with countless lives lost.

In 1944 the city was again badly damaged as a total of 2,000 tons of bombs were dropped on 22 May. On 14 October, the tonnage was repeated with 2,018 tons when Halifax, Lancaster, and Mosquito bombers appeared over Duisburg as part of Operation Hurricane. This daylight raid was followed by a night attack; over 24 hours about 9,000 tons of HE and incendiaries had been dropped on Duisburg. Numerous similar attacks followed until the end of 1944.

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Duisburg in April 1945. The US 17th Airborne Division, acting as regular infantry and not in a parachute role, met only scattered resistance in the vicinity and captured the city on 12 April 1945.

On 8 May 1945 the ADSEC Engineer Group A, led by Col. Helmer Swenholt, commanding officer of the 332nd Engineer General Service Regiment, constructed a railway bridge between Duisburg and Rheinhausen across the Rhine. It was long, and constructed in six days, fifteen hours and twenty minutes, a record time. It was named the &quot;Victory Bridge&quot;.

=== Post-World War II period ===

A total of 299 bombing raids had almost completely destroyed the historic cityscape. 80% of all residential buildings had been destroyed or partly damaged. Almost the whole of the city had to be rebuilt, and most historic landmarks had been lost.

Beginning in the mid-1960s, the decline of Duisburg&#x27;s steel and mining industry caused a significant loss of residents. While in 1975 approximately 590,000 people were living in Duisburg, the number had shrunk to 518,000 in 1985.

Duisburg celebrated its 1100th anniversary in 1983. The city&#x27;s population recovered a little in the following years, up to 537,000 in 1992. It declined to 488,000 in 2011. On 19 July 2004, it was hit by a tornado. The municipal theater and parts of the city center were damaged. The city hosted the 7th World Games in 2005. In 2010, 21 people died because of a mass panic at the Love Parade; over 500 people were injured.

==Demographics==
In 2010, Duisburg had a population of 489,600, a slight decrease since 2006.

Duisburg has one of the highest proportions of Muslims in Germany, with the city&#x27;s Muslim population at approximately 15%, or 71,000 residents, as of 2011. 

Population structure of non-German residents:

=== Turkish community ===
Duisburg is home to 85,000 people of Turkish origin. Other estimates suggest that the Turkish population is as large as 100,000. The neighborhood of Marxloh is a majority Muslim neighborhood, with over 54% of residents not having German citizenship as of 2018. Marxloh has experienced significant unemployment, poverty and high crime rates. The Wall Street Journal has referred to Marxloh as &quot;Germany&#x27;s quintessential Muslim ghetto.&quot; The new Merkez Mosque, one of the largest Muslim places of worship in Western Europe, was built with help by the way of contribution of 3.2 million euro from the EU and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Asiye Nur Fettahoğlu, a Turkish-German actress, was born in Duisburg on 12 November 1980.

== Transport ==
=== Duisburg Port ===
Duisburg-Ruhrorter Häfen is the city&#x27;s inland port. It is officially regarded as a seaport because seagoing river vessels go to ports in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Numerous docks are mostly located at the mouth of the Ruhr where it joins the Rhine.

Each year more than 40 million tonnes of various goods are handled with more than 20,000 ships calling at the port. The public harbour facilities stretch across an area of . There are 21 docks covering an area of and of wharf. The area of the Logport Logistic Center Duisburg stretches across an area of . With 2.5 million TEU it is also the largest inland container port, based on 2011 figures. A number of companies run their own private docks and 114 million tonnes of goods yearly (2010) are handled in Duisburg in total.

=== Roads ===
Duisburg is served by several autobahns, with 3 east–west routes and 2 north–south routes. A3 forms a bypass east of the city and mostly serves through traffic. A59 runs parallel to A3 and serves the city from north to south with 14 interchanges, much more than most other cities in the Ruhr area. The A40 and A42 are two east–west routes that serve central and northern Duisburg. Autobahn A40 also serves major through traffic from the Netherlands to Berlin and points east. A short spur, A524 serves southern Duisburg. Most Autobahns have six lanes or are upgraded to six lanes (A59).

Apart from the autobahns, no Bundesstraßen serve the city directly. B8 runs through the city, but uses A59&#x27;s alignment. B288 runs in the extreme south of the city, and serves traffic to and from Krefeld. Several bridges span the Rhine, most prominently the A40 and A42 bridges, but also the L287 suspension bridge and the L237 arch bridge, a three-lane bridge with 2 lanes per peak direction with dynamic lane usage.

Besides Düsseldorf Duisburg is a residence of the Deutsche Oper am Rhein, one of the major opera houses in Germany. The Duisburg Philharmonic Orchestra is one of Germany&#x27;s orchestras with an international reputation.

Due to its history as a harbour city and a trade and industrial center, Duisburg offers a variety of architectural places of interest, such as the German Inland Waterways Museum. Buildings vary from old churches such as St. Johann Baptist in Duisburg-Hamborn, which was built in 900, to modern age buildings such as Micro-Electronic-Centrum in Duisburg-Neudorf, built in 1995.

<text>Tocumen International Airport () is the primary international airport serving Panama City, the capital of Panama. The airport serves as the homebase for Copa Airlines and is a regional hub to and from the Caribbean, South, North and Central America and additionally features routes to some European cities as well as cargo flights to Qatar.

==History==

During World War II, Panamanian airports were leased exclusively by the U.S. Armed Forces. The nearest airport to Tocumen was the &quot;Paitilla Point Airfield&quot;. Several airports were built to protect the Panama Canal from foreign aggression. The 37th Pursuit Group at Albrook Field replaced the P-40 Warhawks of the 28th Pursuit Squadron at the Paitilla Point airbase from 9 December 1941 though 26 March 1942 in the immediate aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack.

Tocumen International Airport was inaugurated on June 1, 1947, by President Enrique Adolfo Jiménez, and airport operations began before the construction works were completed. The administrative building/passenger terminal was inaugurated seven years later, during the administration of Colonel José Antonio Remón Cantera. The old airport building, which currently is being used as a cargo terminal, was built on an area of and was above sea level. As time passed, and due to Panama&#x27;s role as a country of transit, that terminal became too small to attend to the growing demand for air operations. These circumstances compelled the aeronautical authorities at the time to consider expanding the airport. Work on the new buildings began in 1971.

The bed of the Tocumen river was diverted to construct the new terminal building. 

The terminal opened on August 15, 1978, and operations began on September 5. The Tocumen International Airport is one of few airports in the region that has two landing runways able to serve the largest commercial aircraft operating today.
The name of the airport was changed in 1981 by the military government to Omar Torrijos International Airport, in honor of the Panamanian leader who died on July 31, 1981. 

After nine years, the original name was reestablished after the fall of the dictatorship of Panama by the U.S. invasion of 1989, when the airport was seized by 82nd Airborne Division paratroopers.
The original runway (03L/21R) is mainly used for cargo and private flights, but also as a supplement to the primary runway during peak traffic periods. The main runway (03R/21L) is and is used primarily for commercial flights, the 03R direction is ILS Cat. I enabled. Until May 31, 2003, Tocumen International Airport was managed by the Civil Aeronautics Directorate (which is known today as the Civil Aeronautics Authority). On June 1 of that year, an innovative terminal management platform was created through Law No. 23 of January 29, 2003, which set out a regulatory framework for the management of airports and landing strips in Panama. This law allowed the creation of Aeropuerto Internacional de Tocumen, S.A., also referred to as Tocumen, S.A., which currently manages the terminal. This law is one of a number of laws that restructured the aeronautical sector in Panama to further its improvement and modernization.

In August 2015, it was announced that Emirates would operate flights to Tocumen International Airport from Dubai starting February 2016, at which point it would have become the world&#x27;s longest non-stop flight. In January 2016, the route was delayed due to a lack of economic opportunities for the flight. It has not yet been announced when the flight will begin regularly scheduled operations. It was planned to make the route between Tocumen International Airport and Dubai the longest flight in the world, until Emirates started flying between Dubai and Auckland.

On 16 March 2023, Aeropuerto metro station of Panama Metro was open in the airport.

==Expansion==

===First phase===
In 2006, Tocumen S.A. started a major expansion and renovation program. The main passenger terminal was expanded at a cost of approximately US$21 million. New boarding gates were built to allow more flights to and from Panama, and to facilitate the growth of commercial and internal circulation areas. Tocumen Airport administration acquired 22 new boarding bridges and replaced the oldest 14. This included the addition of 6 remote positions, hence allowing Tocumen Airport to have a total of 28 boarding gates. The new installations were opened in 2006. The airport also has a VIP lounge, Copa Club, operated by the partnership between United Airlines and Copa Airlines that caters to Copa&#x27;s partner airlines and Star Alliance members. It also had an Admirals Club for American Airlines, which closed on June 30, 2012. The Lounge Panama, a VIP airport lounge operated by Global Lounge Network started operations at Tocumen on January 9, 2019.

The next step of the modernization project was the purchasing of new equipment to provide service and support to the common areas of the airport. New equipment included: modern boarding gates and elevators, luggage conveyor belts, flight information system, and revamping the air conditioning system.

The renovation of the old Tocumen International Airport (originally built in 1947) to be used solely as a cargo terminal, was the last step of the modernization project of Tocumen International Airport. It included the redesign of the central building, the construction of new buildings for cargo companies among other improvements.

===Second phase===
The second expansion phase of Tocumen International Airport is the Northern Terminal. At a cost of US$60 million, a completely new terminal with 12 additional terminal gates was built. With these 12 new gates plus the existing 22 gates and the six remote aircraft docks, there is a total of 40 gates. The new facilities included the platforms, taxiways and a new road which connect both the cargo terminal and the airport&#x27;s administration building. The Muelle Norte is linked to the main passenger terminal and have 10 moving walkways for passengers and commercial areas. The luggage sorting system was expanded to accommodate increased demand. The tender for the design of the second phase was given to Ecuador-based Planman Cia Ltda. Colombia-based Aerotocumen won the tender of the construction of the North Terminal.

===Third phase===
The South Terminal started a bidding process during the first half of 2012 and the contract was acquired by the Brazilian company Odebrecht. Tocumen S.A. made an investment of US$780 million, which included 20 additional gates. It included the construction of a new terminal, hundreds of parking spots, Tocumen river diversion, and four new direct-access lanes to the airport. The new terminal was officially inaugurated on April 29, 2019 and started operations on June 22, 2022.

<doc id="101616" wikidata="Q2337" url="?curid=101616" title="Smolensk">
<text>Smolensk is a city and the administrative center of Smolensk Oblast, Russia, located on the Dnieper River, west-southwest of Moscow.

First mentioned in 863, it is one of the oldest cities in Russia. It has been a regional capital for most of the past millennium, beginning as the capital of an eponymous principality in the 11th-15th centuries, then the Smolensk Voivodeship of Lithuania and Poland, and Smolensk Governorate and Oblast within Russia. It was the main stronghold of the Smolensk Gate, a geostrategically significant pass between the Daugava and Dnieper rivers, and as such was an important point of contention in the struggle for dominance in Eastern Europe, passing at various times between Lithuania, Poland and Russia. In more recent history, it was captured by Napoleon&#x27;s Franco–Polish forces and Hitler&#x27;s Germany during their marches towards Moscow, and was the place of the Smolensk air disaster of 2010. 

It has a population of 

== Etymology ==
The name of the city is derived from the name of the Smolnya River. Smolnya river flows through Karelian and Murmansk areas of north-western Russia. The origin of the river&#x27;s name is less clear. One possibility is the old Slavic word () for black soil, which might have colored the waters of the Smolnya. An alternative origin could be the Russian word (), which means resin, tar, or pitch. Pine trees grow in the area, and the city was once a center of resin processing and trade. The Byzantine emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959) recorded its name as ().

== Geography ==
The city is located in European Russia on the banks of the upper Dnieper River, which crosses the city within the Smolensk Upland, which is the western part of the Smolensk–Moscow Upland. The Dnieper River flows through the city from east to west and divides it into two parts: the northern (Zadneprove) and southern (center). Within the city and its surroundings the river takes in several small tributaries.

In the valleys are stretched streets, high ridges, hills, and headlands form the mountain. Smolensk is situated on seven hills (mountains). The old part of the city occupies the high, rugged left (south) bank of the Dnieper River. The area features undulating terrain, with a large number of tributaries, creeks and ravines.

== History ==
=== Medieval origins ===
Smolensk is among the oldest Russian cities. The first recorded mention of the city was 863 AD, two years after the founding of Kievan Rus&#x27;. According to Russian Primary Chronicle, Smolensk (probably located slightly downstream, at the archaeological site of Gnezdovo) was located on the area settled by the East Slavic Radimichs tribe in 882 when Oleg of Novgorod took it in passing from Novgorod to Kiev. The town was first attested two decades earlier, when the Varangian chieftains Askold and Dir, while on their way to Kiev, decided against challenging Smolensk on account of its large size and population.

The first foreign writer to mention the city was the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus. In &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; (c. 950) he described Smolensk as a key station on the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. The Rus&#x27; people sailed from the Baltic region up the Western Dvina (Daugava) River as far as they could then they portaged their boats to the upper Dnieper. It was in Smolensk that they supposedly mended any leaks and small holes that might have appeared in their boats from being dragged on the ground and they used tar to do that, hence the city name.

The Principality of Smolensk was founded in 1054. Due to its central position in Kievan Rus&#x27;, the city developed rapidly. By the end of the 12th century, the princedom was one of the strongest in Eastern Europe, so that Smolensk princes frequently controlled the Kievan throne. Numerous churches were built in the city at that time, including the church of Sts. Peter and Paul (1146, reconstructed to its presumed original appearance after World War II) and the church of St. John the Baptist (1180, also partly rebuilt). The most remarkable church in the city is called Svirskaya (1197, still standing); it was admired by contemporaries as the most beautiful structure east of Kiev.

Smolensk had its own veche since the very beginning of its history. Its power increased after the disintegration of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and although it was not as strong as the veche in Novgorod, the princes had to take its opinion into consideration; several times in 12th and 13th centuries there was an open conflict between them.

=== Between Lithuania and Russia ===

Although spared by the Mongol armies in 1240, Smolensk paid tribute to the Golden Horde, gradually becoming a pawn in the long struggle between Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Grand Principality of Moscow. The last sovereign monarch of Smolensk was Yury of Smolensk; during his reign the city was taken by Vytautas the Great of Lithuania on three occasions: in 1395, 1404, and 1408. After the city&#x27;s incorporation into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, some of Smolensk&#x27;s boyars (e.g., the Sapiehas) moved to Vilnius; descendants of the ruling princes (e.g., the Tatishchevs, Kropotkins, Mussorgskys, Vyazemskys) fled to Moscow.

Three Lithuanian Smolensk regiments took part in the 1410 Battle of Grunwald against the Teutonic Knights. It was a severe blow to Lithuania when the city was taken by Vasily III of Russia in 1514. To commemorate this event, the Tsar founded the Novodevichy Convent in Moscow and dedicated it to the icon of Our Lady of Smolensk. The loss of Smolensk to Moscow was the inspiration for &quot;Stańczyk&quot;, one of the most famous paintings by Polish painter Jan Matejko.
In order to repel future Polish–Lithuanian attacks, Boris Godunov made it his priority to heavily fortify the city. The stone kremlin constructed in 1597–1602 is the largest in Russia. It features thick walls and numerous watchtowers. Heavy fortifications did not prevent the fortress from being taken by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1611 after a long twenty-month siege, during the Time of Troubles and Dimitriads. Weakened Muscovy temporarily ceded Smolensk land to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the Truce of Deulino. The city was granted Magdeburg rights in 1611 and was the seat of Smolensk Voivodeship for the next forty-three years.

To recapture the city, the Tsardom of Russia launched the so-called &quot;Smolensk War&quot; against the Commonwealth in 1632. After a defeat at the hands of king Wladislaw IV, the city remained in Polish–Lithuanian hands. In 1632, the Uniate bishop Lew Kreuza built his apartments in Smolensk; they were later converted into the Eastern Orthodox Church of Saint Barbara. The hostilities resumed in 1654 when the Commonwealth was being affected by the Khmelnytsky Uprising and the Swedish deluge. After another siege, on 23 September 1654, Smolensk was recaptured by Russia. In the 1667 Truce of Andrusovo, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth renounced its claims to Smolensk.

=== Modern history ===

Smolensk has been a special place to Russians for many reasons, not least for the fact that the local cathedral housed one of the most venerated Orthodox icons, attributed to St. Luke. Building the new Cathedral of the Assumption was a great project which took more than a century to complete. Despite slowly sinking into an economic backwater, Smolensk was still valued by the Tsars as a key fortress defending the route to Moscow. It was made the seat of Smolensk Governorate in 1708.

In August 1812, two of the largest armies ever assembled clashed in Smolensk. During the hard-fought battle, described by Leo Tolstoy in &quot;War and Peace&quot; (Book Three Part Two Chapter 4), Napoleon entered the city. Total losses were estimated at 30,000 men. Apart from other military monuments, central Smolensk features the Eagles monument, unveiled in 1912 to mark the centenary of Napoleon&#x27;s Russian campaign.
At the beginning of World War I, the 56th Smolensk Infantry Division was first assigned to the First Army of the Imperial Russian Army. They fought at the Battle of Tannenberg. It was subsequently transferred to the 10th Army and fought at the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes. In March 1918, the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic, proclaimed in Minsk under the German occupation, declared Smolensk part of it. In February–December 1918, Smolensk was home to the headquarters of the Western Front, North-West Oblast Bolshevik Committee and Western Oblast Executive Committee. On 1 January 1919, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed in Smolensk, but its government moved to Minsk as soon as the German forces had been driven out of the city several days later.

=== Soviet period ===
In 1940, from Smolensk, the Katyn Massacre occurred, in which some 22,000 Polish POWs were murdered by the NKVD. At this time Boris Menshagin was mayor of Smolensk, with his deputy Boris Bazilevsky. Both of them would be key witnesses in the Nuremberg Trials over the massacre.
During World War II, Smolensk once again saw wide-scale fighting during the first Battle of Smolensk when the city was captured by the Germans on 16 July 1941. The first Soviet counteroffensive against the German army was launched in August but failed. However, the limited Soviet victories outside the city halted the German advance for a crucial two months, granting time to Moscow&#x27;s defenders to prepare in earnest. Over 93% of the city was destroyed during the fighting; the ancient icon of Our Lady of Smolensk was lost. Nevertheless, it escaped total destruction. In late 1943, Hermann Göring had ordered Gotthard Heinrici to destroy Smolensk in accordance with the Nazi &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy. He refused and was punished for it. The city was finally liberated on 25 September 1943, during the second Battle of Smolensk. The rare title of Hero City was bestowed on Smolensk after the war.

After the Germans captured the city in 1941, they found the intact archives of the Smolensk Oblast Committee of the Communist Party, the so-called Smolensk Archive. The archive was moved to Germany, and a significant part of it eventually ended up in the United States, providing Western scholars and intelligence specialists with unique information during the Cold War on the local workings of the Soviet government during its first two decades. The archives were returned to Russia by the United States in 2002.

=== Recent events ===

On 10 April 2010, a Tu-154 military jet carrying Polish president Lech Kaczyński, his wife, and many notable political and military figures crashed in a wooded area near Smolensk while approaching the local military airport. All ninety-six passengers died immediately on impact. The purpose of the visit was to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre.

In June 2013, archaeologists of the Russian Academy of Sciences discovered and unearthed ancient temples in Smolensk dated to the middle to second half of the 12th century, built on the left bank of the Dnieper River. At the time the city was the capital of Smolensk principality.

In September 2013, Smolensk widely celebrated its 1,150th anniversary with funds spent on different construction and renovation projects in the city. In celebration the Central Bank of Russia issued commemorative coins made of precious metals.

==Demographics==

== Attractions ==
Owing to its long and rich history, Smolensk is home to many examples of Russian architecture ranging from the Kievan Rus period to post-WWII Stalinist style. Although the city was destroyed several times over, many historically and culturally significant buildings remain, including a large number of churches and cathedrals. The most famous of these are the Cathedral of the Assumption, the Immaculate Conception Church, and the Church of St. Michael the Archangel, which is one of the few structures from before the Mongol invasion remaining in Russia.
=== The Smolensk Kremlin ===
The Smolensk Kremlin, built at the end of the 16th century during the reign of Tsars Fyodor I Ioannovich and Boris Godunov, under the supervision of the architect Fyodor Kon, is one of the greatest achievements of Russian medieval architecture and military engineering.
=== Churches and cathedrals ===
=== Monuments ===
Being the site of many great battles in Russian history, Smolensk is home to many monuments commemorating its rich military history.
==== Lopatinsky garden ====
==== Square of Memory of Heroes ====

== Administrative and municipal status ==
Smolensk serves as the administrative center of the &quot;oblast&quot; and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Smolensky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Smolensk Urban Okrug—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban okrug status.

<text>John Crome (22 December 176822 April 1821), once known as Old Crome to distinguish him from his artist son John Berney Crome, was an English landscape painter of the Romantic era, one of the principal artists and founding members of the Norwich School of painters. He lived in the English city of Norwich for all his life. Most of his works are of Norfolk landscapes.

Crome&#x27;s work is in the collections of public art galleries, including the Tate Gallery and the Royal Academy in London, and the Castle Museum in Norwich. He produced etchings and taught art.

==Biography==
John Crome was born on 22 December 1768 in Norwich, and baptised on 25 December at St George&#x27;s Church, Tombland, Norwich. He was the son of John Crome, a weaver (who is also described as either an innkeeper or a lodger at a Norwich inn), and his wife Elizabeth. After a period working as an errand boy for a doctor (from the age of 12), he was apprenticed to Francis Whisler, a house, coach and sign painter. At about this time he formed a friendship with Robert Ladbrooke, then an apprentice printer. They shared a room and went on sketching trips in the fields and lanes around Norwich. They occasionally bought prints to copy.

Crome and Ladbrooke sold some of their work to a local printseller, Smith and Jaggars, and it was probably through the print-seller that Crome met Thomas Harvey of Old Catton, who helped him set to up as a drawing teacher. Crome had access to Harvey&#x27;s art collection, which allowed him to develop his skills by copying the works of Thomas Gainsborough and Meindert Hobbema. Crome received further instruction and encouragement from the artist John Opie, and the English portraitist William Beechey, whose house in London he frequently visited.

In October 1792 Crome married Phoebe Berney. They produced two daughters and six sons, two of whom, John Berney Crome and William Henry Crome became landscape painters.

In 1803 Crome and Ladbrooke formed the Norwich Society of Artists, a group that also included Robert Dixon, Charles Hodgson, Daniel Coppin, James Stark and George Vincent. Their first exhibition was in 1805; it marked the start of the Norwich School of painters, the first art movement created outside London. Crome contributed 22 works to its first exhibition, held in 1805. He served as President of the Society several times and held the position at the time of his death. With the exception of the times when he made short visits to London, he had little or no communication with the great artists of his own time. He exhibited 13 works at the Royal Academy between 1806 and 1818. He visited Paris in 1814, following the defeat of Napoleon, and later exhibited views of Paris, Boulogne, and Ostend. Most of his subjects were of scenes in Norfolk.

Crome was drawing master at Norwich School for many years. Several members of the Norwich School art movement were educated at the school and were taught by him, including Stark and Edward Thomas Daniell. He also taught privately, his pupils including members of the influential Gurney family, whom he stayed with whilst in the Lake District in 1802.
He died at his house in Gildengate, Norwich, on 22 April 1821, and was buried in St. George&#x27;s Church. On his death-bed he is said to have gasped, &quot;Oh Hobbema, my dear Hobbema, how I have loved you&quot;. A memorial exhibition of more than 100 of his works was held in November that year by the Norwich Society of Artists.

Crome&#x27;s Broad and nearby Crome&#x27;s Farm in The Broads National Park are named after him. The area surrounding Heartsease is covered by the Crome ward and division on Norwich City Council and Norfolk County Council respectively.

An incident in Crome&#x27;s life was the subject of the one-act opera &quot;Twice in a Blue Moon&quot; by Phyllis Tate, to a libretto by Christopher Hassall: it was first performed in 1969. In the story Crome and his wife split one of his paintings in two to sell each half at the Norwich Fair.

==Works==

Crome, who is sometimes referred to as &quot;Old Crome&quot;, worked in both watercolour and oil, producing more than 300 oil paintings during his career.

Between 1809 and 1813 he made a series of etchings. They were not published in his lifetime, although he issued a prospectus announcing his intention to do so.

His two main influences are considered to be Dutch 17th-century painting and the work of the Welsh landscape painter Richard Wilson. Along with the artist John Constable, Crome was one of the earliest English painters to represent identifiable species of trees, rather than generalised forms. His works, renowned for their originality and vision, were inspired by direct observation of the natural world combined with a comprehensive study of old masters.

The art historian Andrew Hemingway has identified a theme of leisure in Crome&#x27;s work, citing particularly his works depicting the beach at Great Yarmouth, and the River Wensum in his native Norwich. An example of the latter is the oil painting &quot;Boys Bathing on the River Wensum, Norwich&quot;, which was painted in 1817. It depicts a scene at New Mills, the location of several of Crome&#x27;s works.

<doc id="101618" wikidata="Q83236" url="?curid=101618" title="Chamonix">
<text>Chamonix-Mont-Blanc (; ), more commonly known simply as Chamonix (&quot;Chamôni&quot;), is a commune in the Haute-Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in Southeastern France. It was the site of the first Winter Olympics, held in 1924.

Chamonix is situated in the French Alps just north of Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in Western Europe. Between the peaks of the Aiguilles Rouges and the notable Aiguille du Midi, it borders both Switzerland and Italy. It is one of the oldest ski resorts in France, popular with alpinists and mountain enthusiasts. Via the cable car lift to the Aiguille du Midi it is possible to access the off-piste (backcountry) ski run of the Vallée Blanche (White Valley).

==Name==
The name Campum munitum, meaning fortified plain or field, had been used as early as 1091. By 1283 the name had been abbreviated to a similar form to the modern Chamonis. Other forms through the ages include Chamouny in 1581, Chamony in 1652, Chamouni in 1786, and the particular spelling Chamonix from 1793.

==Status==
Chamonix is the fourth-largest commune in metropolitan France, with an area of . Its population of around 8,900 ranks 1,089th within the country of France.

==History==

The valley was first mentioned in 1091, when it was granted by the Count of the Genevois to the great Benedictine house of St. Michel de la Cluse, near Turin, which by the early 13th century had established a priory there. However, in 1786 the inhabitants bought their freedom from the canons of Sallanches, to whom the priory had been transferred in 1519.

In 1530, the inhabitants obtained from the Count of the Genevois the privilege of holding two fairs a year, while the valley was often visited by the civil officials and by the bishops of Geneva (first recorded visit in 1411, while St. Francis de Sales came there in 1606). But travellers for pleasure were very rare.

Chamonix was part of the historical land of Savoy and emerged as the feudal territory of the House of Savoy during the 11th to 14th centuries. The historical territory is shared between the modern countries of France, Italy and Switzerland. The House of Savoy became the longest surviving royal house in Europe. It ruled the County of Savoy to 1416 and then the Duchy of Savoy from 1416 to 1860.

The first party to publish (1744) an account of their visit was that of Richard Pococke, William Windham and others, such as the Englishmen who visited the Mer de Glace in 1741. In 1742 came P. Martel and several other Genevese, in 1760 Horace Bénédict de Saussure, as well as rather later Marc-Théodore Bourrit.

The growth of tourism in the early 19th century led to the formation of the &quot;Compagnie des Guides de Chamonix&quot; in 1821, to regulate access to the mountain slopes (which were communally or co-operatively owned), and this association held a monopoly of guiding from the town until it was broken by French government action in 1892; thereafter guides were required to hold a diploma issued by a commission dominated by civil servants and members of the French Alpine Club rather than local residents.

From the late 19th century on, tourist development was dominated by national and international initiatives rather than local entrepreneurs, though the local community was increasingly dependent upon and active in the tourist industry.

The commune successfully lobbied to change its name from Chamonix to Chamonix-Mont-Blanc in 1916. However, following the loss of its monopoly, the &quot;Compagnie&quot; reformed as an association of local guides, and retained an important role in local society; it provided the services of a friendly society to its members, and in the 20th century many of them were noted mountaineers and popularisers of mountain tourism, notably the novelist Roger Frison-Roche, the first member of the &quot;Compagnie&quot; not to be born in Chamonix.
Serving as the host city for the first Winter Olympic Games in 1924 further raised Chamonix&#x27;s profile as an international tourist destination.

During the Second World War, a Children&#x27;s Home operated in Chamonix, in which several dozens of Jewish children were hidden from the Nazis. Some of those who hid them were recognised as &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;.

By the 1960s, agriculture had been reduced to a marginal activity, while the number of tourist beds available rose to around 60,000 by the end of the 20th century, with about 5 million visitors a year.

==Geography==

===Settlements===
The commune of Chamonix-Mont-Blanc includes 16 villages and hamlets. From north to south: Le Tour , Montroc, Le Planet, Argentière , Les Chosalets, Le Lavancher, Les Tines, Les Bois, Les-Praz-de-Chamonix , Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, Les Pècles, Les Mouilles, Les Barrats, Les Pélerins, Les Gaillands, and Les Bossons .

===Climate===
Due to its elevation, Chamonix has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb,&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification&quot;)&quot;, with an average annual precipitation of . Summers are mild and winters are cold and snowy.

== Demographics ==
==Mountain and winter sports==
Chamonix is a winter sports resort town that still attracts skiers ready to test themselves both on the pistes in the official area and against the challenges of the backcountry skiing. As the highest European mountain west of Russia, Mont Blanc attracts mountain climbers. Chamonix is known as the &quot;Gateway to the European Cascades.&quot; The Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc has been held every August since 2003.

There is a cable car up to the Aiguille du Midi. Constructed in 1955, it was then the highest cable car in the world and remains the highest vertical ascent cable car in the world.

Chamonix is divided into three separate ski areas (Les Grands Montets, Brévent - Flégère, le domaine de Balme) which run along the valley from Le Tour down to Les Houches. In addition to the 1924 Winter Olympic Games, the town hosts a round of the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup and the Arlberg-Kandahar. It previously hosted the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1937 and the 1984 and 1988 Biathlon World Championships for women.

The 1930 Ice Hockey World Championships was mostly held at Chamonix. The town also hosted the European Curling Championships in 1991 and 1999.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
The town of Chamonix is served by French &quot;Route Nationale&quot; 205 (RN 205), nicknamed the &quot;Route blanche&quot;, or &quot;white route&quot;, due to its snowiness. This is an extension of French &quot;autoroute&quot; 40 (A40), similarly nicknamed the &quot;autoroute blanche&quot;, which ends at Le Fayet, a village in the commune of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains. The 11.6-km Mont Blanc Tunnel, which opened in 1965, links Chamonix to Courmayeur in Italy. Chamonix is linked to Switzerland by what used to be RN 506a. In 2006, it was converted to a &quot;Route Départementale&quot; 1506, with a part of it integrated into RN 205.
The nearest airport to Chamonix is Geneva Cointrin International and it is away.

===Rail===

Chamonix is served by the metre-gauge St Gervais-Vallorcine Line, operated by SNCF. The line from Saint Gervais (on the standard-gauge rail network) to Chamonix opened in 1901; it was extended to Vallorcine in 1908. The line holds the record for the steepest gradient on any standard (adhesion) railway. There are 10 stations on this line within the commune of Chamonix: Montroc-le-Planet, Argentière, La Joux, Les Tines, Les Praz-de-Chamonix, Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, Chamonix-Aiguille-du-Midi, Les Moussoux, Les Pélerins and Les Bossons.

From Vallorcine, the rail route continues over the border into Switzerland, meeting the SBB network at Martigny. This latter section, a metre-gauge cog railway, is operated by Transports de Martigny et Régions SA. The train service from Vallorcine to Martigny is known as the Mont Blanc Express. Timetables on the St Gervais-Vallorcine and Vallorcine-Martigny sections are synchronized.

The 5.1-km Montenvers Railway is a cog railway that provides access to the tourist site of Montenvers. Opened in 1909, its rail station was built next to SNCF&#x27;s Chamonix station on the St Gervais-Vallorcine Line. In fact the two stations are directly linked. Montenvers provides further tourist access to middle and high mountain areas.

===Cable cars===
Chamonix has one of the highest cable cars in the world, which links the town to the summit of the Aiguille du Midi at 3842 m. It is based on an older system built in 1920, rebuilt in the first half of the 1950s over five summer seasons, fully modernized in 1979, and upgraded again in 2008. On the other side of the valley, another cable car links Chamonix to the viewpoint of Planpraz. A second line links Planpraz to the summit of Le Brévent at 2525 meters. Many other cable cars exist in the valley, and are heavily used by skiers and residents. The Plan Joran chairlift at the base of Les Grands Montets is due to be replaced by a 10-person gondola for the Winter 2014/15 season.

<doc id="101619" wikidata="Q1288248" url="?curid=101619" title="John Sell Cotman">
<text>John Sell Cotman (16 May 1782 – 24 July 1842) was an English marine and landscape painter, etcher, illustrator, and a leading member of the Norwich School of painters.

Born in Norwich, the son of a silk merchant and lace dealer, Cotman was educated at the Norwich Grammar School. He showed an early talent for art. It was intended that he followed his father into the family business but, intent on a career in art, he moved to London in 1798, where he met artists such as J. M. W. Turner, Peter de Wint and Thomas Girtin, whose sketching club he joined, and whom he travelled with to Wales and Surrey. By 1800 he was exhibiting at the Royal Academy, showing scenes of the Welsh countryside there in 1801 and 1802. His drawing expeditions took him throughout southern Britain, and to Yorkshire, where he stayed with the Cholmeley family during the three summers of 1803–1805.

His sons Miles Edmund and John Joseph Cotman became notable painters in their own right.

==Life==
===Early years===

John Sell Cotman was born in Norwich, on 16 May 1782, the eldest child of Edmund Cotman and his wife Ann (née Sell) living at 26 Bridge Street, in St George&#x27;s parish. Edmund Cotman was a hairdresser who later became a silk merchant and a lace dealer. Their son was baptised at St. Mary Coslany, Norwich, on 7 June 1782. The family name was written as &quot;Cottman&quot; in the parish baptism record, which has survived.

The young Cotman was educated at Norwich Grammar School, and is recorded as starting there as a non-paying pupil on 3 August 1793. He showed a talent for art from an early age and would often go out on drawing trips into the countryside around Norwich and the North Norfolk coast. A story survives that the boy&#x27;s headmaster, Dr Samuel Forster, disliked cats. When Forster saw a large realistic-looking cardboard cat on his desk, he held the silhouette up, saying, &quot;I know who is the only boy who could have drawn this.&quot; 

Edmund Cotman intended his son to follow into the family business, but the boy was instead intent on a career in art. When asked for his advice, the artist John Opie replied to Cotman&#x27;s father, &quot;Let him rather black boots than follow the profession of an artist.&quot; A drawing from this period, &quot;House at St Stephen&#x27;s Road, Norwich&quot; (1794), is considered to be the earliest surviving work by Cotman, sketched when he was 12.

===London and Yorkshire===

Cotman moved to London, probably in 1798. He lived at 28 Gerrard Street, Soho, initially making a living through commissions from print-sellers. His sketches at Rudulph Ackerman&#x27;s print shop at 96 The Strand were studied by the Norwich artist John Thirtle when a young man. Cotman came under the patronage of Thomas Munro, physician to the Bridewell and Bethlehem Hospitals, whose house in Adelphi Terrace was a studio and a meeting place for artists that had included the young J. M. W. Turner and Thomas Girtin. 

Cotman was influenced by Girtin, and soon joined his sketching club. During the summer of 1799 the two artists travelled together south of London to Surrey on a drawing expedition. In 1800 (and again in 1802 with his landlord, the artist Paul Sandby Munn), Cotman travelled to Wales on a sketching trip. 

In 1800, Cotman exhibited at the Royal Academy for the first time. He exhibited other Welsh scenes at the Royal Academy in 1801 and 1802. In 1800, he was awarded an honorary palette by the Society of Arts. He continued to exhibit at the Academy until 1806. He was based during the early 1800s in London, but is known to have advertised in Norwich—in September 1802 he advertised his services as a drawing teacher in the &quot;Norwich Mercury&quot;.

In the three summers of 18031805, Cotman stayed with the Cholmeley family at Brandsby Hall in Yorkshire. On the last of these three visits from London, he made a series of watercolours of the River Greta, after he was invited to visit Rokeby Park, the home of the English traveller John Morritt. Cotman&#x27;s delicate paintings from these visits are among the finest produced by a European watercolourist.

===Return to Norwich===

In late 1806, Cotman returned to live in Norwich. He joined the recently-formed Norwich Society of Artists, and exhibited 149 works with the society between 1807 and 1810. He became the society&#x27;s President in 1811.

Cotman married Ann Miles at Felbrigg parish church on 6 January 1809. The pair remained devoted throughout their married lives. Their eldest child Miles Edmund Cotman was born on 5 February the year after their marriage. Their daughter Ann was born in July 1812 after the family moved to Great Yarmouth in April 1812, followed by three more sons, John Joseph Cotman, (Francis) Walter, and Alfred Henry. who were born in 1814, 1816 and 1819 respectively. A sixth child, a daughter, was born in 1822.

As part of his teaching, Cotman operated his own version of a watercolour subscription library, so that his pupils could take home his drawings to copy. In 1810, Cotman began to etch, and the following year his first set of etchings (&quot;Miscellaneous Etchings&quot;) was published, strongly influenced by the work of the Italian artist Piranesi. All but one of the subjects were architectural, and were mostly of Yorkshire buildings. He later published a set of etchings of the ancient buildings of Norfolk (&quot;Architectural Antiquities of Norfolk&quot; (1818).

===Move to Great Yarmouth===
From 1812 to 1823, Cotman lived on the Norfolk coast at Great Yarmouth, where he studied the shipping, and mastered depicting the form of sea waves. Some of his finest marine pieces date from this time. 

===Normandy tours===

In 1817, 1818, and 1820, whilst Cotman was living in Great Yarmouth, he visited Normandy to make drawings of the landscape and buildings of the region. The three tours are well documented, as Cotman wrote letters about his travels to his wife, and to Dawson Turner, who made extensive use of them in &quot;A Tour of Normandy&quot; (1820). The idea for Cotman to tour Normandy came from his friend Dawson Turner, who had visited the region in September 1815 with the British artist Thomas Phillips to view the works of art taken to Paris by Napoleon.

Cotman went first to London, where he purchased a &quot;camera lucida&quot; from Sir Henry Englefield, and viewed the newly-installed Elgin Marbles at the British Museum. The &quot;camera lucida&quot; was used for all three of Cotman&#x27;s tours, but he seems to have struggled to use it to depict buildings accurately:

Cotman sailed from Brighton to Dieppe on 18 July, and began exploring the area around Dieppe the following day. His first trip to Normandy lasted over five weeks. He described his accommodation during this trip as being of poor quality, and that the local population were openly hostile towards him. From the drawings he produced in Normandy he is apparent that he took sketch books and drawing equipment, but no painting materials.

The second trip took place the following year, and lasted seven weeks. During this trip Cotman was joined by Dawson Turner and his daughters, which made the time abroad more pleasant for them all. The third trip to Normandy in 1820 saw Cotman travelling to the southernmost part of the region, which captivated him. It allowed him to explore more of the countryside than he had done in previous years. An injury to his leg forced him to spend time recuperating in Caen.

Upon returning home to Great Yarmouth, Cotman worked tirelessly to produce the etchings needed for Dawson Turner&#x27;s &quot;Architectural Antiquities of Normandy&quot;, which was published in 1822. The project enhanced the artist&#x27;s reputation, and he became as famous as he was ever to become during his lifetime. Two years later Dawson Turner published Cotman&#x27;s 100 etchings based on his sketches, with notes produced from Cotman&#x27;s letters.

===Return to Norwich===

Cotman returned to Norwich in 1824, hoping to improve his financial position, and moved into a large house in St Martin&#x27;s Plain, opposite the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, where he built up a collection of prints, books, armour, and models of ships, to aid his compositions. He showed work from 1823 to 1825 at the Norwich Society of Artists&#x27; annual exhibitions.

In 1825, Cotman became an Associate of the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolours and was a frequent exhibitor there until 1839. During this period in his career he was driven to despair by his constant financial struggles.

===King&#x27;s College, London===
In January 1834, Cotman was appointed Master of landscape drawing at King&#x27;s College School in London, partly on the recommendation of J.M.W. Turner. In 1836 Miles Edmund Cotman was appointed to assist his father. The poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti was one of his pupils. In London, Cotman developed friendships with the artists James Stark, George Cattermole, Samuel Prout, and Cornelius Varley. In 1836, he became an honorary member of the Institute of British Architects. In 1838, all of his etchings were published by Henry George Bohn.

In 1834, Miles Edmund remained in Norwich to work as an art teacher, when the rest of the Cotman family moved to London upon Cotman&#x27;s appointment at King&#x27;s College. A year after his move to London, Mile Edmund moved to London to be his father&#x27;s assistant, after his brother John Joseph returned to Norwich. Miles Edmund succeeded his father as drawing master at King&#x27;s College in 1843.

===Final years===

From 1839, Cotman became severely depressed, a condition that lasted into 1841. That year, he resumed his correspondence with Dawson Turner. Granted a fortnight&#x27;s leave from King&#x27;s College, he journeyed from London to Great Yarmouth by ship and then on to Norwich, ultimately staying in Norfolk for two months before returning to the capital. He produced some chalk drawings of church interiors, and of the Norfolk countryside, the dates of which allow his journey around the county to be traced: his sketches included &quot;Itteringham, 12 November&quot; and &quot;Storm off Cromer&quot;. During this period he was able to visit his elderly father at Thorpe St Andrew outside Norwich, when he probably began preparatory work for a painting, entitled &quot;From my Father&#x27;s House at Thorpe&quot;. His last oil painting—dated 18 January 1842 and never completed—was &quot;A View of the Norwich River&quot;.

Cotman&#x27;s depression returned, and by June 1842 he had become seriously ill, dying &quot;of natural decay&quot; on 24 July 1842. He was interred in the cemetery of St John&#x27;s Wood Chapel, London. In his will he left everything to his wife Ann, and enabled her to receive a pension. His paintings and drawings were sold off from May 1843, fetching lower and lower prices for his financially-troubled family as the sales continued.

==Paintings, drawings, and etchings==

Over 600 of Cotman&#x27;s watercolours and drawings were bought by the Norwich curator James Reeve, who sold more than half of them to the British Museum in 1902. The remainder of Reeve&#x27;s collection was acquired by the Norwich Castle from the collection of the Norfolk industrialist Russell Colman. Some of Cotman&#x27;s paintings, etchings, and drawings are on public display in Norwich, where well over 2,000 works are held. Other works are at the Leeds Art Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, and other regional centres. In the United States, there are works by Cotman at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut, and in other galleries around the country.

Cotman was not thought to be important during his lifetime, and he made little money from sales of his paintings and drawings. The sale of his works and library took place over five days at Christie&#x27;s. His drawings and pictures fetched £260, his collection of books and art was sold off for £300 and the sum total for his prints was £30.

Cotman&#x27;s architectural etchings have long been considered as a valuable record for historians.

==Reputation and legacy==
Cotman and Crome were the two finest of the Norwich School of painters, who were both recognised by the public during their lives, with Cotman&#x27;s &quot;Architectural Antiquities of Normandy&quot; bringing him wider praise. The architect Augustus Pugin, in his &quot;Specimens of Gothic Architecture&quot; (1823), mixed praise and criticism [the plates] are drawn and etched in a masterly style, but with a good deal of &quot;management&quot;, by which the subjects appear, in several instances, of grander character than really belongs to them...In some Plates also, the human figures are evidently below the size of life, and so exaggerate the size of the buildings they are placed against.

The art historian Andrew Moore, describes the artists as &quot;two of the most original talents in the history of early nineteenth century British art&quot;, and that they were rivalled only by Turner, Girtin, and the English artist John Constable. The 1887 edition of the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; noted that Cotman&#x27;s reputation had improved over time, and described him as &quot;one of the most original and versatile of English artists of the first half of this century, a draughtsman and colourist of exceptional gifts, a water-colourist worthy to be ranked among the greater men, and excellent whether as a painter of land or sea&quot;.

In 1888 the Norwich Art Circle showed 100 of Cotman&#x27;s works at Norwich, the first time his collected works had been exhibited. This event led to a critical appraisal of his output and secured a second exhibition that year at the Burlington Fine Arts Club.

The art historians Lawrence Binyon and William Dickes both wrote extensively about Cotman&#x27;s oil paintings and watercolours. Cotman&#x27;s oils were first exhibited when they were shown at the Tate Gallery, London in 1922. According to his biographer Sydney Kitson, Cotman&#x27;s reputation was enhanced by &quot;The Water-Colour Drawings of John Sell Cotman&quot; by Paul Oppé, which appeared in a special edition of &quot;The Studio&quot; in 1923.

Cotman&#x27;s reputation has been hidden by misinformation, and by works that were misattributed. Among his pupils, the most notable were Thirtle and his own sons.

<text>Enschede (; local ) is a city and municipality in the province of Overijssel and the Twente region of the eastern Netherlands. The east of the urban area reaches the border of the German city of Gronau.

The municipality of Enschede consisted only of the city of Enschede until 1935, when the rural municipality of Lonneker, which surrounded the city, was annexed after the rapid industrial expansion of Enschede that began in the 1860s and involved the building of railways and the digging of the Twentekanaal.

Enschede is home to the football club FC Twente, a one-time Dutch champion; the University of Twente; and the last Polaroid film factory.

During the Carnival festivities, which take place in February or March, Enschede is temporarily renamed &quot;Krekkelstad&quot;, after a local biscuit.

== Geography ==
Enschede lies in the eastern part of Overijssel and is the easternmost city of more than 140,000 inhabitants in the Netherlands. The city lies a few kilometres from Germany, which borders the municipality. A few small rivers flow through or surround the city, such as the Roombeek and Glanerbeek.

Enschede contains five official city districts, which also include surrounding villages in the municipality:

*Stadsdeel Centrum (Binnenstad, Boddenkamp, De Bothoven, &#x27;t Getfert, Hogeland Noord, Horstlanden-Veldkamp, Laares, Lasonder-&#x27;t Zeggelt)
*Stadsdeel Noord (for example: Lonneker, Deppenbroek, Bolhaar, Mekkelholt, Roombeek, Twekkelerveld)
*Stadsdeel Oost (for example: Wooldrik, Velve-Lindenhof, De Eschmarke, &#x27;t Ribbelt, Stokhorst, Dolphia, &#x27;t Hogeland and Glanerbrug)
*Stadsdeel Zuid (Wesselerbrink, Helmerhoek and Stroinkslanden)

Like most of the Netherlands, Enschede features an oceanic climate (Cfb in the Köppen classification), however, winters tend to be less mild than the rest of the Netherlands due to its inland location. Although the former military airport is derelict and plans to revive the place were canceled in 2012, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute still maintains a weather station there.

== History ==
=== Preindustrial era ===
The early history of Enschede is largely unknown, but a settlement existed around the Old Marketplace in early medieval times. The name of this settlement is mentioned as &quot;Anescede&quot; or Enscede meaning either &quot;near the border&quot; (with Bentheim) or &quot;near the Es&quot; and sported a church, a marketplace and a fortified aristocratic house.

Enschede was granted city rights around 1300 which were confirmed in 1325 by Bishop Jan III van Diest and henceforth was allowed to protect itself with a wall. Because a stone wall was too expensive (since stone had to be imported), Enschede had a system of ditches, palisades and hedges instead, which is still reflected in the street-names &quot;Noorderhagen&quot; and &quot;Zuiderhagen&quot; (North Hedge and South Hedge, respectively). The city plan of this era is still recognisable in the street-pattern. The city was spared destruction in 1597 at its capture during the Eighty Years&#x27; War when after a short siege, the Spanish garrison surrendered the city and the defences were razed.

Because the medieval city was largely built of wood and stone houses were the exception, fire was a constant risk and a series of fires in 1517, 1750 and again on 7 May 1862 earned the people from Enschede the nickname &quot;Brandstichters&quot; (arsonists).

=== Industrial era ===
The last fire coincided with the start of the growth of the city into a large production center for textiles, stimulating a large increase in population, which by 1894 had reached an estimated 18,267: nineteenth-century urban growth was at first rather chaotic. The names of the slums (like &quot;De Krim&quot; and &quot;Sebastopol&quot;) are still notorious, although they have long since been torn down. In 1907 the &quot;laissez faire&quot; mentality was dropped and Enschede was the first city in the Netherlands to draw up an official expansion plan, incorporating the surrounding municipality of Lonneker.

Textile production, originally a cottage industry, reached an industrial scale at the start of the 19th century. In particular, &quot;bombazijn&quot; (a mixture of cotton and linen) proved a successful export. One such factory to have produced textiles in the late 19th century is the Hardick &amp; Seckel Factory.

=== World War II ===

During World War II, Enschede was one of the first Dutch cities to be captured by German troops due to its proximity to the German border. Resistance members helped many of the Jews from Enschede to hide on farms in the vicinity. Out of approximately 1300 Jews in Enschede, 500 were saved (38.5%), compared to less than 20% in the rest of the Netherlands. This higher survival rate is attributed to three members of the Jewish Council of Enschede, Sig Menko, Gerard Sanders and Isidoor Van Dam who took the initiative, against the advice of the Jewish Council of Amsterdam, of urging their community to go into hiding and not to answer the call-up of the Germans for &quot;labour in the East.&quot; Another notable hero of the era was Enschede Pastor Leendert Overduin, who saved hundreds of Jewish children and adults, with help from his sister and others, through a network of safehouses in and around Enschede.

Enschede was bombed on several occasions, most notably on 10 October 1943, and 22 February 1944. During the first raid the nearby airport (then &quot;Fliegerhorst Twente&quot;) was a target of opportunity for the VIII Bomber Command during a raid on rail- and waterways in Münster. 141 people died and many houses were damaged. The latter mission named Enschede as a target of opportunity during Big Week after bombers had been recalled due to adverse weather.

=== The end of the industrial age ===
In the 1960s, the textile industry was completely lost, at the cost of approximately 30,000 jobs. Most of the large factory complexes were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s, some were renovated and given a new purpose. For example, homes were built in the former factories of Jannink and Van Heek. In addition, part of the Jannink complex was converted into a museum. Enschede developed into a service city.

In the 1970s the textile production in Enschede came to a halt, due to fierce competition from mainly the Far East. This had a profound effect on the populace. Enschede became one of the poorest municipalities in the Netherlands and went bankrupt. Large areas of industrial wasteland came to mark the city. With the support of the national government, this property was acquired and rebuilt. The city center was rendered a car-free zone.

In 1961 it was announced a third technical university would be founded, placed on an estate on the western border of Enschede. This green campus called Drienerlo was donated by the city of Enschede. Building was complete in 1964, when the first and only full-facility university of the Netherlands was realised.

On 13 May 2000, a fireworks storage depot in Enschede exploded, destroying part of the neighborhood of Roombeek and killing 23 people, including 4 firemen. In 2001 a referendum confirmed the proposal of the city council to expand the built-up area into the Usseler Es, an area of historic cultural significance and of geological importance, as it was here that the Usselo horizon was discovered. The renovations at Roombeek were finished in the year 2012. The place where the factory used to be is now a monument.

The Alpha Tower was completed in 2008 and this tower block with 91 apartments spread over 29 floors, with a height of 101 meters, is the tallest building in Enschede and the whole province of Overijssel. In the period 1995–2010, Enschede grew by approximately 10,000 inhabitants, but since then the growth has stagnated.

==Religion==
The largest religion in Enschede is Christianity with 34.9% of the population being Christian.

Enschede has a large Assyrian community, the first Assyrians came to Enschede in the 1970s, primarily from Turkey (Tur Abdin). Today there are three Syriac Orthodox Churches in the city which meet the spiritual needs of Enschede&#x27;s more than 10,000 Assyrians.
== Demographics ==
As of 2020, Enschede had a total population of 159,640 people.

=== Inhabitants by origin ===
== Economy ==

The city is a former centre of textile production. When this industry left the area for cheaper production centers in South-East Asia, Enschede became one of the poorest municipalities in the Netherlands. More educated and wealthier citizens have historically migrated to the Randstad region; decades of renovation work in the city center have been carried out with the goal of making Enschede more attractive to this group.
Modern shopping centres and department stores that until recently were only found in much larger cities have been opened. Enschede is host to many yearly festivals and the Old Market Square is often the venue for events, live music and other activities at the weekend.

The proximity to Germany has, historically, been another major factor in the city&#x27;s economic activity, ranging from the smuggling of coffee and tobacco in the 19th and 20th century, to large numbers of Germans, who visit the city&#x27;s shops and weekly markets. Therefore, many natives of Enschede speak German more or less fluently.

The city is co-operating with the nearby municipalities of Almelo, Borne and Hengelo as &quot;Netwerkstad Twente&quot;. A draft law plan to merge Enschede with Hengelo and Almelo was defeated in parliament under the influence of opposition from the other towns.

Grolsch beer is brewed in Enschede, and the tyre manufacturer Apollo Vredestein B.V. head office and a factory is in the city. It is one of the most important employers of the region.

== Culture ==
=== Museum ===

There are several museums in Enschede, among them the Rijksmuseum Twenthe for art. A museum of natural history and a museum dedicated to the history of the textiles industry, both closed in January 2007, have merged, and have reopened in April 2008 in new premises on a new location under the name TwentseWelle (Source/Well of Twente). The new location is situated in Roombeek, where a fireworks disaster took place in 2000. The new museum is located partly in a renovated old textile factory, in reference to Enschede&#x27;s textile history, and partly in an adjourning new building, designed by the Amsterdam-based firm SeARCH (project architect: Bjarne Mastenbroek). Besides museums there are also several art spaces, the most prominent being Villa de Bank and TETEM. The latter focuses on art and technology, and aims to be accessible for a wide public.
Enschede is also home of The Netherlands Symphony Orchestra.

De Museumfabriek (formerly TwensteWelle) is a museum in the Roombeek district that arose from a merger of three institutions: Natuurmuseum Enschede, Van Deinse Instituut and Fabriekcomplex Jannink. In this museum, the cultural-historical heritage of Twente is linked to the natural-historical heritage, a unique combination for the Netherlands. The museum was opened in April 2008 by the then Queen Beatrix.

=== Music and theater ===

The German-Dutch relationship is characteristic of music culture, which arose through cooperation in the border region and the dominant textile industry in the 19th and 20th centuries. Especially during the period of reversal after the World War I, a close German-Dutch cultural cooperation developed in Gronau and Enschede, which became increasingly important from string quartets, salon orchestras and hot dance music bands to symphony orchestras and an operetta company (&quot;Enschedesch Opera en Operette Gezelschap&quot;) with their own performances. At the same time, jazz also found enthusiastic supporters from 1920 onwards.

The three major concert stages for classical music in Enschede – the Muziekcentrum, the Twentse Schouwburg and the Grote Kerk – have been operating under the name Podium Twente since September 2002 and since September 2011 under the name Wilminktheater en Muziekcentrum Enschede. There is a varied offer of concerts, theater, youth and youth performances and the like to visit.

In November 2008 the Nationaal Muziekkwartier opened its doors in Enschede. A new large theatre, pop stage Atak, the ArtEZ Conservatory, the Orkest van het Oosten (now the Dutch Symphony Orchestra), the Twente Music School, the Nationale Reisopera (now the Nederlandse Reisopera) and Podium Twente (now Wilminktheater en Muziekcentrum Enschede) have settled in this dominant building opposite the Central Station in Enschede. There will be a new large square, the Willem Wilminkplein.

In December 2012, the Serious Request action from national radio station 3FM took place in Enschede, which collected more than 12.2 million euros (almost US$16.2 million).

==Research, education and health care==

The University of Twente (&quot;Universiteit Twente&quot;), a university with mostly technical studies, is located in Enschede. It is one of the four technical universities in the Netherlands (besides Delft University of Technology, Eindhoven University of Technology and the Wageningen University and Research Centre). The Universiteit Twente is also the only large-campus university in the Netherlands.

The university has courses in pure technical studies such as Applied Physics, Applied Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Informatics/Computer Science and Industrial Engineering and also offers study programmes in Communication, Psychology, Economic Sciences, International Business Administration, Public Administration, Applied Medicine and Biomedical Technology; the latter attract a broader public. Since 2006, the programmes of European Studies, Advanced Technology, Creative Technology and ATLAS University College have been added to the university&#x27;s offerings.

The Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation of the University of Twente, with former name International Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences, (known by its abbreviation ITC) runs MSc, Master&#x27;s, Diploma and PhD courses in Geo-Information Science for developing countries. Students from all over the world attend the ITC. Enschede also has an academy of arts and design combined with a conservatory named ArtEZ.

Enschede is also home to one of the three campuses of Saxion University of Applied Sciences (&quot;Saxion Hogeschool&quot;), a polytechnical school offering internationally recognized Bachelor&#x27;s degrees and Master&#x27;s degrees in a wide range of fields, including engineering, economics, social work, investigations and health care. The other campuses are located in Deventer and Apeldoorn.

The Medisch Spectrum Twente (MST) hospital is one of the largest top-clinical hospitals of the Netherlands and features important tertiary care departments, fulfilling a supraregional role. It includes a level I trauma center as well. The hospital is strongly involved in higher medical education, with up to 300 medical students following their internships in the hospital at any given time, closely working together with the University of Twente&#x27;s Technical Medicine program training a new type of technically specialized doctors.

==Transport==
=== Rail ===

Enschede is a terminus station of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) railway lines from the west. Trains operate to Hengelo, Almelo, Zwolle, Deventer, Apeldoorn, Amersfoort Centraal, Hilversum, Amsterdam Zuid, Schiphol Airport, Utrecht Centraal and Den Haag Centraal.

To the east there is a line to Gronau, Germany, which has two more stations in the Netherlands: Enschede De Eschmarke and Glanerbrug. The latter two have low ridership. The line is served by DB Regionalbahn Westfalen (part of the German Deutsche Bahn), to Münster and to Dortmund, each on an hourly interval and alternating half-hours in the service to Gronau.

There is no track connection between the two systems. The through line had been retained for eventual NATO use during the Cold War even after through passenger service was ended (September 1981), although it was in serious disrepair in later years. With the renewal of service to Germany (May 2001) the track was severed; there is a gap of about 30 centimeters between them which means that Enschede is now a &quot;double terminus station&quot; with tracks to the West (the Netherlands) and to the East (Germany) but with no connection between them.

There is also Enschede Kennispark railway station, near the football stadium.

=== Water ===
Enschede is situated at the south-east terminus of the Twentekanaal.

=== Bus ===

There is a network of bus lines connecting nearly every part of the city with the centre. Enschede also has bus connections to nearby towns and cities, like Hengelo, Oldenzaal and south towards Haaksbergen, Neede and Eibergen. Since 10 December 2023 the bus lines are operated by Arriva, under the RRReis brand.

=== Air ===
Previously, Enschede had a combined regional civil airport, Enschede Airport, and Airbase Twenthe of the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The latter was closed in 2007; the former was closed in 2008. However, it remains in operation for business air traffic flying via a charter or private jet, and recreational flights.

=== Roads ===
Around the center districts of Enschede is a complete ring road with a length of approximately 8 km, which is popularly called &quot;de singel&quot;. This was constructed in the period between 1916 and 1929. Most major arterial roads connect to the canal. Enschede is connected to the national road network by means of the A/N35 and the N18. Below and on the edge of the center are various parking facilities, the most famous and largest of which is the Van Heekgarage, which is located under the Van Heekplein. At the end of 2012, construction of an additional entrance and exit at Kuipersdijk was started as the South entrance. Van Heekgarage is the largest underground parking garage in the Netherlands with a capacity of 1650 cars.

== Sports ==
Enschede&#x27;s association football club is FC Twente. Twente were the 2010 Eredivisie champions but were relegated to the second-tier league, the Eerste Divisie, after the 2017–18 season.

<text>Salhouse Broad, one of the Norfolk Broads, is situated on the River Bure in The Broads in Norfolk, England.

The broad is situated just off the river and attracts little through traffic. It lies south of Hoveton Great Broad and approximately half a mile north of the village of Salhouse. Salhouse Broad is accessible from the landward side and moorings are also permitted to fee-paying boat visitors. It is privately owned and managed in conjunction with the community of Salhouse. The broad covers an area of and is home to many forms of wildlife including the Norfolk hawker dragonfly and the swallowtail butterfly. Black swans have been recorded on this broad. Salhouse Broad is unusual in being the result of the flooding of tenth century sand and gravel diggings, not of peat diggings like most of the broads.

<text>Salhouse is a village and civil parish in the Broads in the English county of Norfolk. It lies south of the River Bure and Salhouse Broad, about north-east of Norwich. The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 1,462 in 604 households, increasing to 1,486 in 638 households at the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of Broadland although areas adjoining the river and broad fall into the executive area of the Broads Authority.

==Churches==
All Saints Church, which is thatched and believed to date mainly from the 14th century (little remaining of an older chapel on the site), stands on a hill beside the B1140 Salhouse-Wroxham Road. The church contains among other features an oak rood screen, a unique sacring bell which hangs in the chancel and dates from the reign of Queen Mary, and two coffin lids discovered under the nave floor in 1839 and dated to the 13th century. There is also a red brick Baptist church in Chapel Loke, off Lower Street, which dates from 1802.

==Other buildings and facilities==
To the west of All Saints Church stands the Grade II listed Salhouse Hall, built in red brick with limestone detailing, was uninhabited for 30 years before being refurbished for cottage rental. Parts of this building may date from the 16th century although it is mostly 18th century with 19th-century Gothic style remodelling. The village also features the Bell Inn, a 17th-century public house and the Lodge Inn, which is located halfway between Salhouse and Wroxham. Salhouse is served by Salhouse railway station, located on the Bittern Line which runs between and via and once featured two waiting rooms, although they are no longer in regular use. Salhouse has a post office, village store and coffee shop in Lower Street and several other small businesses including kennels and a Potter.

==Salhouse Broad==
The 32-acre Salhouse Broad, lying about half a mile to the north of the village, is privately owned and jointly managed with the local community. It is accessible by boat from the River Bure and via a footpath from the village.

==Toponymy==
Salhouse is first recorded in 1291 as &quot;Salhus&quot;. The first element is believed to derive from Old English &quot;salh&quot; &quot;sallow&quot;, a kind of willow. The word still exists in dial. English &quot;saugh&quot;. Sallow descends itself from OE inflexional &quot;salg-&quot; (ME &quot;salwe&quot;).

The second element is the Old English &quot;hūs&quot; or Old Norse &quot;hús&quot; &quot;house&quot;.

Homonymy with Sahurs (Normandy, &quot;Salhus&quot; ar. 1024) in the low Seine valley, which shows together with other place-names and anthroponyms in Normandy, that there were Anglo-Saxons among the Danish settlers.

A further variation on the spelling may be seen as &quot;Psalhous&quot; in 1452.

==Rackheath Eco Town==

During 2008, proposals were made for a controversial new eco-town, to contain over 3,000 homes, to be built in Rackheath and Salhouse. The proposals have attracted much criticism, mainly because it is to be built on a greenfield site, within a mile of The Broads National Park.

<text>Middelburg () is a city and municipality in the south-western Netherlands serving as the capital of the province of Zeeland. Situated on the central peninsula of the Zeeland province, &quot;Midden-Zeeland&quot; (consisting of former islands Walcheren, Noord-Beveland and Zuid-Beveland), it has a population of about 48,000.

In terms of technology, Middelburg played a role in the Scientific Revolution at the early modern period. The town was historically a center of lens crafting in the Golden Age of Dutch science and technology. The invention of the microscope and telescope is often credited to Middelburg spectacle-makers (including Zacharias Janssen and Hans Lipperhey) in the late 16th century and early 17th century.

==History== 

The city of Middelburg dates back possibly to the late 8th century or early 9th century. The first mention of Middelburg was as one of three fortified towns (&quot;borgs&quot;) erected on Walcheren (then an island) to guard against Viking raids. In 844 a monastery was built on the site, which remained an active Catholic foundation until the Reformation. Foundations for Middelburg&#x27;s &quot;stately and picturesque&quot; main church were first laid in the 10th century; additional construction continued through the Middle Ages.

Middelburg was granted city rights in 1217. During the Middle Ages, it became an important trading centre in the commerce between England and the rising cities of Flanders, a fact commented on by Geoffrey Chaucer in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. The town continued to gain in power and prestige during the 13th and 14th centuries.

From 1559 to 1603, Middelburg was the episcopal see of a Catholic bishopric covering all Zeeland. In the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the city was captured by Dutch rebels from the Spanish forces during a long siege (1572–1574). The northern provinces of the Low Countries won their independence from their former Spanish Habsburg rulers and formed the Dutch Republic, a Protestant state. Later, during the 17th century (the Dutch Golden Age), Middelburg became, after Holland&#x27;s metropolis Amsterdam, the most important center for the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. As such, Middelburg also played an important role in the 17th century slave trade.

Samuel Ben Israel, son of Menasseh Ben Israel, is buried in Middelburg at the Sephardic burial site located at the &#x27;Jodengang&#x27; outside the citywall. Menasseh Ben Israel negotiated with Cromwell the opening of England, and its colonies, to the Jews. Middelburg also has an Ashkenazic burial site, which is located at the Walensingel inside the city wall. In 1994 the synagogue was restored, as it was partially destroyed during the Second World War. This synagogue was the third one to be built in the Netherlands during the Golden Age. In the hall of the railway station there is a plaque of remembrance for the Jews of Zeeland who started their journey to the death camps from the Middelburg train station.

About a third of the old city centre was devastated by bombs and fire in the early phases of World War II, on 17 May 1940. It is still not certain if German bombers or French artillery were responsible. The town was captured and liberated by British troops during Operation Infatuate on 6 November 1944. After the War, as much of the destroyed part of the old town center was rebuilt and restored along pre-War lines as far as was possible. The city&#x27;s archives, however, had been incinerated during the German bombardment.

Modern Middelburg has preserved and regained much of its historic and picturesque character. There are lavish 17th and 18th century merchant houses and storehouses standing along canals, of a similar style as found in cities like Amsterdam. The old city moats are still there, as are two of the city gates, the Koepoort Gate and the Varkenspoort Gate. Part of the 18th century moat and defence works, however, were demolished in the 19th century to make way for a commercial canal that crosses Walcheren from Vlissingen to Veere. The medieval abbey is still in use today, as a museum and as the seat of the provincial government.

== Notable locals ==

Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder (1573–1621) was a still life painter of the Dutch Golden Age who worked most of his life in Middelburg. He had three sons, Johannes Bosschaert (1606/08– 1628/29), Ambrosius Bosschaert II (1609–1645) and Abraham Bosschaert the Younger (1612–1643) who were all Dutch Golden Age painters. 
The painter Pieter Gaal (1769–1819) was born, settled and died here, after traveling over Europe to paint.

Another well-known citizen of Middelburg was the admiral and explorer Jacob Roggeveen, who was born in the city in 1659 and died there in 1729. Roggeveen discovered Easter Island (Rapa Nui) in the South Pacific Ocean on Easter Sunday, 6 April 1722. Further discoveries on the same journey included islands of the Tuamotu group, now part of French Polynesia.

Petronella Johanna de Timmerman, scientist and poet, was born here in 1723. In 1774 she was inducted as an honorary member of the academy Kunstliefde Spaart Geen Vlijt. Also, she presented the academy with poems, translated from French plays. She died in Utrecht in 1786.

==Geography and climate==

Aside from the town of Middelburg, the municipality also includes several population centres, including: Arnemuiden, Kleverskerke, Nieuw- en Sint Joosland and Sint Laurens.
The town is close to the coast but the distance of 10–15 km means the winters are somewhat colder with especially lower winter minima and higher summer maxima. It has a temperate oceanic climate (Cfb) with few extremes. Winters tend to be mild, especially considering the northern latitude, summers are cool and precipitation is spread out evenly over the year. All seasons are warming up by about 0.5 °C/decade due to anthropogenic warming.
The extremes measured since 2000, 2 km northeast of the town in the countryside with calibrated equipment have been −17.2 °C on 4 February 2012 and 40.9 °C on 25 July 2019, the latter unofficially being a new Dutch all-time high record, slightly above the 40.7 °C measured at Gilzerijen KNMI and 40.6 °C in Westdorpe. Vlissingen KNMI measured −11.0 °C and 37.5 °C on the same dates, clearly showing how much the influence is diminished just 8 km further inland.
The climate is warming due to anthropogenic influences, clearly witnessed by the fact that the previous record of 37.5 °C was measured just a year before. Also, in the past minima have been at and probably below −20 °C in winter months. Snowcover, days with airfrost and icedays (Tx &lt; 0.0 °C) have greatly diminished and with it ice speedskating on the canals, a favourite sport in the winter months, has become very infrequent since 2013 especially.

==Culture and recreation==
When William of Orange decided to found the first university in the Netherlands in 1575, he initially considered locating it in Middelburg. Ultimately he chose Leiden, however, and Middelburg—as well as all of Zeeland—remained without a university until 2004 when University College Roosevelt (formerly known as Roosevelt Academy), affiliated with Utrecht University, was established. A campus of the HZ University of Applied Sciences is also located in the city, although this institution has its headquarters in the nearby city of Vlissingen.

===Cultural institutions===
===Theaters and concert halls===
===Sightseeing===
===Sports===
Middelburg has a rugby club, Oemoemenoe, and four football (soccer) clubs: MZVC, Zeelandia Middelburg, Jong Ambon and FC Dauwendaele. Jong Ambon is translated Young Ambon, and consists of mostly Ambonese players. FC Dauwendaele is the club of the neighborhood of Dauwendaele.

==Transportation==

Middelburg has a railway station with intercity train connections to Vlissingen, Goes, Roosendaal, Rotterdam, The Hague, Leiden, Haarlem, and Amsterdam. Four trains leave every hour in both directions.

==Twin cities==
==In popular culture==
* In Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s 1929 novel &quot;The Romantic Prince&quot;, set in the late 1460s, Middelburg is the home town of Mister Danvelt and his son Philip. The Danvelt home is a beautiful, gabled house on the Lange Delft, not far from Middelburg&#x27;s imposing abbey. Philip Danvelt inherits the house and lives there with his wife Johanna when he is arrested by Lord Claude de Rhynsault.
*In &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, c. 1387, the Merchant speaks of the absolute importance of keeping the sea free of pirates &quot;bitwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle&quot; (&quot;between Middelburg and Orwell&quot;, the latter referring to the River Orwell in England).

<text>Kirkwall (, , or ; ) is the largest town in Orkney, an archipelago to the north of mainland Scotland. First mentioned in the Orkneyinga saga, it is today the location of the headquarters of the Orkney Islands Council and a transport hub with ferries to many locations. It is the centre of the St Magnus International Festival and is also a popular stopping off point for cruise ships. St Magnus Cathedral stands at the heart of the town.

==Etymology==
The name Kirkwall comes from the Norse name meaning &quot;church bay&quot;, the settlement having been established by the Norsemen in the 11th century. As late as 1525 the name is recorded as Kirkevaag. This became in time &quot;Kirkwaa&quot; and then eventually Kirkwall - but how the second syllable came to be spelled &quot;wall&quot; is not certain. MacBain quotes F. W. L. Thomas: &quot;How, I ask, could &quot;vágr&quot; come to be represented by wall? Whence came the &quot;ll&quot;? Was it that Scottish immigrants finding the sound of &quot;vá&quot; represented it in writing by &#x27;wall,&#x27; the &quot;ll&quot; at first being silent?&quot; 

==History==
The town was first mentioned in the Orkneyinga saga in the year 1046, when it was recorded as the residence of , the Earl of Orkney, who was killed by his uncle Thorfinn the Mighty. 

In 1486, King James III of Scotland elevated Kirkwall to the status of a royal burgh, and in time it would return a Burgh commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland. 

After Union with England it combined with other towns to form the Northern Burghs, sending a single MP to Parliament. In 1918, the Parliamentary Burgh of Kirkwall merged into Orkney and Shetland.

===Earth houses===
On the western edge of the town, surrounded by Hatston Industrial Estate, there is a prehistoric monument, known as the &quot;Grain Earth House&quot; (see Historic Scotland). It is a short, low, stone-walled passage, deep underground, leading to a small pillared chamber. This kind of earth house (or &quot;souterrain&quot;) is characteristic of the Northern Isles (although the Grain Earth House is unusually deep below ground). It was originally connected to a surface dwelling, which has since disappeared. The purpose of these Iron Age structures remains unknown. Further west, towards Grimbister, there is a similar structure, known as Rennibister Earth House.

==Governance==
Kirkwall is the administrative centre of Orkney, and the site of the headquarters of both Orkney Islands Council and NHS Orkney.

Although sometimes referred to as &quot;The City and Royal Burgh of Kirkwall&quot; Kirkwall is not technically a city.

==Geography==
Kirkwall is north of Aberdeen and north of London. It is situated on the northern coast of Mainland, Orkney, with its harbours in the bay of Kirkwall to the north, and with Scapa Flow to the south. Its parish, St Ola, forms the isthmus between Firth and Holm.
It is the most populous island settlement in Scotland.

===Climate===
Kirkwall has an oceanic climate (Cfb), with a strong maritime influence on its temperature. As a result, it is generally cooler than the rest of the UK in the summer. The exception is that Kirkwall tends to be warmer than Shetland, being closer to mainland Scotland.

==Demography==
The population of Kirkwall is continuously on the rise. The population rose from 6,205 in 2001 to 9,293 in 2011 to reach an estimated 10,020 in 2020.

==Economy==
Kirkwall harbour with nearly of quay edge is the second commercial hub for Orkney after Hatston. There is a Marina, and support for fishing and dive vessels. After extensive work on harbour facilities, the town has become a popular cruise ship stop, with several ships arriving each week in the season. This has added to the prosperity of the town and allowed a thriving sector of independently owned shops. Each year now, 140 cruise ships visit Kirkwall and Stromness.

Weaving in Orkney took place from Viking times, with John Sclater &amp; Co involved in Tweed production in Kirkwall in the 1970s. They used the brand names Norsaga and Jarltex.

==Culture and community==

The Orkney Library and Archive is in Kirkwall. Kirkwall also has the most northerly of the world&#x27;s Carnegie libraries, which was opened by Andrew Carnegie and his wife in 1909. The building survives, although the library has since moved to a larger building on Junction Road which opened in August 2003.

The town has two museums, the larger being The Orkney Museum in Tankerness House, which contains items of local historical interest within one of Scotland&#x27;s best-preserved 16th-century town-houses. It is a Category A listed building Scotland. The prehistoric, Pictish and Viking collections are of international importance. The other museum is the Orkney Wireless Museum, dealing with the history of radio and recorded sound. It is located in a Category C listed building, possibly the former harbour master&#x27;s office, on Junction Road.
Orkney Tourist Board is located in an 18th-century Category B listed building on Broad Street.

There is a Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboat station.

One of the major annual events in the town is the Ba Game, held each Christmas Day and New Year&#x27;s Day between the Uppies and the Doonies, each team representing one half of the town.

===Media and the arts===
The composer Peter Maxwell Davies was among a group which founded the annual St Magnus International Festival which is centred on Kirkwall each midsummer. Notable music acts such as the Wrigley Sisters and Bryttania formed in Kirkwall.

Orkney Theatre, a 384-seat venue, was opened in 2014 next to Kirkwall Grammar School in The Meadows. It has an orchestra pit which can be made available for use by removing two rows of seats.

Kirkwall Harbour can be seen in &quot;The Highlands and Islands – A Royal Tour&quot;, a 1973 documentary about Prince Charles&#x27; visit to the Highlands and Islands, directed by Oscar Marzaroli.
Scottish film-maker Margaret Tait was born in Kirkwall, and many of her films (in particular the &quot;Aspects of Kirkwall&quot; series) are set there.

Long-running The Simpsons character Groundskeeper Willie was born in Kirkwall.

==Landmarks==
Kirkwall has many 17th–18th-century houses and other structures in the local vernacular style. Kirkwall Town Hall was completed in 1884.

==Transport==
Kirkwall is a port with ferry services to Aberdeen and Lerwick, as well as the principal north islands in the group. Hatson pier, the main ferry terminal, is some outside the town centre.

The Aberdeen, Leith, Clyde &amp; Tay Shipping Company operated steamer services to Kirkwall from 1836, with successor companies operating until 2002.

Kirkwall Airport, the main airport for Orkney, is southeast of the town. There are no passenger rail services in Kirkwall, the nearby railways having been industrial or military.

==Religious sites==

The &#x27;Kirk&#x27; of Kirkwall was not the cathedral (which was originally at Birsay), but the 11th-century church of Saint Olaf of Norway. One late medieval doorway survives from this church, and an aumbry from the original church survives within the late 19th-century structure of the present-day Saint Olaf&#x27;s Church (Episcopal) in the town&#x27;s Dundas Crescent. At the heart of the town stands St Magnus Cathedral, which was founded in memory of Saint Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney 1108–1117 by Earl (later Saint) Rögnvald Kali. Next to the cathedral are the ruins of the former Bishop&#x27;s Palace and Earl&#x27;s Palace.

==Sport==
The Pickaquoy Centre, Orkney&#x27;s largest leisure centre, is located in Kirkwall, which opened in 1999.

<text>Saint Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney, sometimes known as Magnus the Martyr, was Earl of Orkney from 1106 to about 1117.
Magnus&#x27;s grandparents, Thorfinn the Mighty, Jarl of Orkney and his wife Ingibiorg Finnsdottir, had two sons, Erlend and Paul, who were twins. Through Ingibiorg&#x27;s father Finn Arnesson and his wife, the family was related to the Norwegian Kings Olav II and Harald II.

==Sources==
Magnus&#x27;s story is told in three Norse sagas: &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; (chapters 34–57); &quot;Magnús saga skemmri&quot;; and &quot;Magnús saga lengri&quot;.

The &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; was first written down around the year 1200, some 80–90 years after the death of Magnus, by an unknown Icelandic author. An abridgement of the &quot;Magnús saga skemmri&quot; (the &quot;Shorter Saga of Magnus&quot;) makes up chapters 39–55 of the &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot;. &quot;Magnús saga lengri&quot; (the &quot;Longer Saga of Magnus&quot;) contains additions to the original by a &quot;Meistari Roðbert&quot; (&quot;Master Rodbert&quot;) dated to the period 1136–70. Robert of Cricklade is believed to be the original Latin author of these additions. Of the three texts Vigfusson (1887) considers the shorter saga to be the &quot;best authority&quot;, noting that it is &quot;of ecclesiastical origin&quot; and &quot;composed with pious intent&quot; rather than to &quot;satisfy a love of good tales&quot;. As is commonly the case for medieval saints&#x27; tales a short book of miracles is appended to both the shorter and longer lives, although they contain somewhat different material. There is also a surviving Latin account of Magnus&#x27;s life, the &quot;Legenda de sancto Magno&quot;, and other material in the &quot;Brevarium Aberdonense&quot; of 1509/10, no doubt based on the missing Vita by the above &quot;magister&quot; Rodbert - part of which is included in the &quot;Magnús saga lengri&quot;.

==Biography==

===Family background===
Magnus was the first son of Erlend Thorfinnsson, Earl of Orkney (who ruled jointly with his brother Paul) and Thora, a daughter of Sumarlidi Ospaksson. They had one other son, Aerling, and two daughters, Gunnhild and Cecilia. Erlend also had a natural daughter called Jaddvor. Paul and Erlend remained on friendly terms until their children grew to adulthood, due to the rivalry between Haakon Paulsson and Aerling Erlendsson. Both are described as talented but also quarrelsome and arrogant. Magnus, by contrast, was &quot;a quiet sort of man&quot;.

Haakon believed himself to be the most highly-born of the cousins and wanted to be seen as the foremost amongst his kin, but Aerling was not one to back down. The fathers did their best to reach a settlement but it became clear that they were both favouring their own offspring and eventually the earldom was divided into two distinct territories.

===Norwegian influence===
Haakon Paalsson went on a long journey to Scandinavia, with his cousin Ofeig, latterly staying with his kinsman, Magnus Barefoot the king of Norway. Whilst there he heard that his father Paal had largely handed over control of Orkney to Earl Erlend and his sons and that after a substantial period of peace the people of Orkney were not keen to see Haakon returning. He therefore asked King Magnus for help in the hope of obtaining the earldom for himself. Haakon suggested to the king that he take back direct control of Orkney as a base for raiding further afield. Magnus was persuaded and in 1098 he launched a major campaign, taking his 8-year-old son Sigurd with him. However, King Magnus had designs that were not envisaged by Haakon. He took possession of the islands, deposing both Erlend and Paal Thorfinsson who were sent away to Norway as prisoners, Haakon and his cousins Magnus and Aerling Erlendsson were taken by King Magnus as hostages and Sigurd was installed as the nominal earl. Sigurd&#x27;s rule was aided by a council, with Haakon as a member of this group.

From Orkney, King Magnus then set out on a raiding expedition along the west coast of Scotland and into the Irish Sea.

===Battle of Menai Straits===
According to the Orkneyinga Saga, Magnus had a reputation for piety and gentleness, which the Norwegians viewed as cowardice. He refused to fight in a Viking raid in Anglesey, Wales, because of his religious convictions, and instead stayed on board the ship during the Battle of Menai Straits, singing psalms. His brother Aerling died while campaigning with King Magnus, either at that same battle or in Ulster.

Magnus was obliged to take refuge in Scotland, but returned to Orkney in 1105 and disputed the succession with his cousin Haakon. Having failed to reach an agreement, he sought help from King Eystein I of Norway, who granted him the earldom of Orkney and he ruled jointly and amicably with Haakon until 1114.

===Execution===
Eventually however, the followers of the two earls fell out, and the sides met at the &quot;Thing&quot; (assembly) on the Orkney mainland, ready to do battle. Peace was negotiated and the Earls arranged to meet each other on the island of Egilsay at Easter, each bringing only two ships. Magnus arrived with his two ships, but then Haakon treacherously turned up with eight ships.

Magnus took refuge in the island&#x27;s church overnight, but the following day he was captured and offered to go into exile or prison, but an assembly of chieftains, tired of joint rule, insisted that one earl must die. Haakon&#x27;s standard bearer, Ofeigr, refused to execute Magnus, and an angry Haakon made his cook Lifolf kill Magnus by striking him on the head with an axe. It was said that Magnus first prayed for the souls of his executioners.

According to the sagas, the martyrdom took place after Easter, on 16 April. The year is often given as 1115, but this is impossible as 16 April fell before Easter that year. Sigurd Towrie follows Orkney Historian Gregor Lamb in placing the death of Magnus in 1118. The best authorities now give the date at 1117 and his 900th anniversary was commemorated in his Cathedral in Kirkwall in Orkney in 2017.

===Burial===
Magnus was first buried on the spot where he died. According to his legend, the rocky area around his grave miraculously became a green field. Later Thora, Magnus&#x27; mother, asked Haakon to allow her to bury him in a church. Haakon gave his permission and Magnus was then buried at &quot;Christchurch&quot; at Birsay.
There were numerous reports of miraculous happenings and healings. William the Old, Bishop of Orkney, warned that it was &quot;heresy to go about with such tales&quot; and was then struck blind at his church, but subsequently had his sight restored after praying at the grave of Magnus, not long after visiting Norway (and perhaps meeting Earl Rognvald Kolsson).

In 1136 Bishop William of Orkney sanctified the murdered Earl Magnus, making him Saint Magnus. It is thought probable that St Magnus Church, Egilsay, was constructed on the island shortly afterwards, at or near the supposed site of the murder. This may have replaced an earlier church which could have already been there at the time of the murder of Magnus.

Magnus&#x27;s nephew, Rögnvald Kali Kolsson, laid claim to the Earldom of Orkney, and was advised by his father Kol to promise the islanders to &quot;build a stone minster at Kirkwall&quot; in memory of his uncle, the Holy Earl, and this became St Magnus Cathedral. When the cathedral, begun in 1137, was ready for consecration, the relics of St Magnus were transferred. On 31 March 1919, during restoration work, a hidden cavity was found in a column, containing a wooden box with bones including a damaged skull. These are held without (much) doubt to be the relics of St Magnus. The remains were replaced in the pillar in 1926, with the location marked with a cross. The box, which is 74.5cm long, 25.7cm wide and 17.6cm high, was made from Scots pine; radiocarbon dating in 2025 showed that &quot;the tree used to construct the box was most likely felled between AD1034 and AD1168.”

==Interpretations==
At the time the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; was first written down Haakon Paalsson&#x27;s grandson, Harald Maddadsson, was Earl of Orkney and the writer of the saga clearly had some difficulty in portraying the kin-slaying of Magnus Erlendsson. Thomson (2008) concludes that the &quot;assembly&quot; that sentenced Magnus was either invented or heavily emphasised in order to &quot;divert some of the blame from Hakon&quot;. Furthermore, in reporting on Earl Haakon&#x27;s death the saga reports that this was &quot;felt to be a great loss, his later years having been very peaceful&quot;.

The beatification of members of the nobility who met a violent death was a common tendency in medieval Scandinavian society. In the case of Earl Magnus it also had a political purpose in that it enabled the surviving descendants of Erlend Thorfinsson and their family to turn this death to their advantage in portraying him as a peaceful martyr. Ultimately they succeeded in maintaining their prominent position in Orkney when Rognvald Kali Kolsson, the son of Magnus&#x27;s sister Gunnhild became earl in 1136.

==In literature and the arts==
Saint Magnus is the subject of the novel &quot;Magnus&quot; by Orcadian author George Mackay Brown, which was published in 1973, and &quot;St Magnus, Earl of Orkney&quot; by John Mooney. In 1977 Peter Maxwell Davies wrote a one-act opera, &quot;The Martyrdom of St Magnus&quot;, based on Mackay Brown&#x27;s novel. In 1989 the English composer Clive Strutt who lives on the Orkney island of South Ronaldsay composed &quot;THREE HYMNS In Praise of Saint Magnus&quot; based on a 12th-century theme existing in Uppsala University, Sweden. The song &quot;Higher Ground&quot; by Rasmussen, which represented Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, is based on the legend of Magnus Erlendsson. In 2023 Loganair named one of their Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander (registration G-BLDV) Magnus Erlendsson.

==Affiliations==
In the Faroes, the St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkjubøur was built around 1300 A.D., at the time of Bishop Erlendur. It is quite sure that the church was used for services (though it never was finished, or has been destroyed later), for estimated relics of Saint Magnus were found here in 1905. Kirkjubøur is one of the most important Faroese historical sites and expected to become a World Heritage Site. In total there are 21 churches in Europe dedicated to St Magnus.

St Magnus the Martyr is a church near the north end of London Bridge in London originally dating to the 12th century, which was reconstructed under the direction of Christopher Wren in the 17th century.

<text>The University of Twente ( ; abbr. ) is a public technical university located in Enschede, Netherlands.
The university has been placed in the top 170 universities in the world by multiple central ranking tables. In addition, the UT was ranked the best technical university in The Netherlands by Keuzegids Universiteiten, the most significant national university ranking.
The UT collaborates with Delft University of Technology, Eindhoven University of Technology and the Wageningen University and Research Centre under the umbrella of 4TU and is also a partner in the European Consortium of Innovative Universities (ECIU).

==History==

The university was founded in 1961 as &quot;Technische Hogeschool Twente&quot; (&quot;THT&quot;). After Delft University of Technology and Eindhoven University of Technology, it became the third polytechnic institute in the Netherlands to become a university. The institution was later renamed to Universiteit Twente (University of Twente) in 1986, as the result of the changes in the Dutch Academic Education Act in 1984.

The Dutch government&#x27;s decision to locate the country&#x27;s third technical university in Enschede, the main city of Twente, had much to do with the north-eastern province&#x27;s rich manufacturing industry (textiles, metal, electrical engineering, chemicals). Another important consideration was the fact that the local economy needed a boost to compensate for the dwindling textile industry. The municipality of Enschede made the Drienerlo estate available for the first campus University of the Netherlands.

==Campus==
The University of Twente was built on the former country estate of Drienerlo, situated between Hengelo and Enschede. The 140-hectare estate consists of woodland, meadows and water. Architects Van Tijen and Van Embden designed the first — and so far only — Dutch campus university along American lines where students and staff live, work and pursue their leisure activities on campus.

The Student Union, which is run entirely by students, manages several premises, including the student social centre (De Pakkerij) and study centre (Wallstreet) in Enschede and The Water sports complex on the Twentekanaal.

== Rankings ==

According to the Times Higher Education Ranking, the University of Twente is considered one of the 200 most prestigious universities globally. The university performed particularly strongly in the Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure 2021 ranking. Here, the university was ranked eleventh in the world rankings. At the same time, psychology and social sciences also performed well, receiving 101–125 in the world rankings.

In the Shanghai Ranking 2021, the University of Twente&#x27;s Geoinformation and Earth Observation Sciences were awarded. In the field of remote sensing, the university landed among the top ten universities in the world. The commitment in this area will be further expanded in the coming years.

According to Keuzegids Universiteiten, the most significant national university ranking, the University of Twente is the best technical university in the Netherlands.

==Organization==

===Administration===

The current rector magnificus of the university is professor Tom Veldkamp. The other two members of the executive board are Vinod Subramaniam (president of the executive board) and Machteld Roos (vice-president)

<doc id="101631" wikidata="Q134456" url="?curid=101631" title="Yukio Mishima">
<text>, born , was a Japanese author, poet, playwright, actor, model, Shintoist, ultra-nationalist, and leader of an attempted coup d&#x27;état which culminated in his suicide. 

Mishima is considered one of the most important postwar stylists of the Japanese language. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times in the 1960s—including in 1968, but that year the award went to his countryman and benefactor Yasunari Kawabata. His works include the novels &quot;Confessions of a Mask&quot; and &quot;The Temple of the Golden Pavilion&quot;, and the autobiographical essay &quot;Sun and Steel&quot;. Mishima&#x27;s work is characterized by &quot;its luxurious vocabulary and decadent metaphors, its fusion of traditional Japanese and modern Western literary styles, and its obsessive assertions of the unity of beauty, eroticism and death&quot;, according to author Andrew Rankin.

Mishima&#x27;s political activities made him a controversial figure to the present day. From his mid-30s onwards, Mishima&#x27;s far-right ideology and reactionary beliefs became increasingly evident. He extolled the traditional culture and spirit of Japan, and opposed what he saw as western-style materialism, along with , globalism, and communism, worrying that by embracing these ideas the Japanese people would lose their &quot;national essence&quot; (&quot;kokutai&quot;) and distinctive cultural heritage to become a &quot;rootless&quot; people. 

In 1968, Mishima formed the Tatenokai (&quot;Shield Society&quot;), a private militia, for the purpose of protecting the dignity of the Emperor as a symbol of Japan&#x27;s national identity. On 25 November 1970, Mishima and four members of his militia entered a military base in central Tokyo, took its commandant hostage, and unsuccessfully tried to inspire the Japan Self-Defense Forces to rise up and overthrow Article 9 of Japan&#x27;s 1947 Constitution to restore autonomous national defense and the divinity of the Emperor, after which he died by seppuku.

==Life and work==
===Early life===

On January 14, 1925, was born in Nagazumi-cho, Yotsuya-ku of Tokyo City (now part of Yotsuya, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo). His father was , a government official in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. His mother, , was the daughter of the 5th principal of the Kaisei Academy. Shizue&#x27;s father, , was a scholar of the Chinese classics, and the Hashi family had served the Maeda clan for generations in Kaga Domain. Mishima&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Sadatarō Hiraoka, the third Governor-General of Karafuto Prefecture, and . Mishima received his birth name Kimitake (公威, also read &quot;Kōi&quot; in on-yomi) in honor of Furuichi Kōi who was a benefactor of Sadatarō. He had a younger sister, , who died of typhus in 1945 at the age of 17, and a younger brother, .

Mishima&#x27;s childhood home was a rented house, though a fairly large two-floor house that was the largest in the neighborhood. He lived with his parents, siblings and paternal grandparents, as well as six maids, a houseboy, and a manservant.

Mishima&#x27;s early childhood was dominated by the presence of his grandmother, Natsuko, who took the boy and separated him from his immediate family for several years. She was the granddaughter of Matsudaira Yoritaka, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Shishido, which was a branch domain of Mito Domain in Hitachi Province; therefore, Mishima was a descendant of the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate, Tokugawa Ieyasu, through his grandmother. Natsuko&#x27;s father, , had been a Supreme Court justice, and Iwanojō&#x27;s adoptive father, Nagai Naoyuki, had been a bannerman of the Tokugawa House during the Bakumatsu. Natsuko had been raised in the household of Prince Arisugawa Taruhito, and she maintained considerable aristocratic pretensions even after marrying Sadatarō, a bureaucrat who had made his fortune in the newly opened colonial frontier in the north, and who eventually became Governor-General of Karafuto Prefecture on Sakhalin Island. Sadatarō&#x27;s father, , and grandfather, , had been farmers. Natsuko was prone to violent outbursts, occasionally alluded to in Mishima&#x27;s works, to which some biographers have traced Mishima&#x27;s fascination with death. She did not allow Mishima to venture into the sunlight, engage in any kind of sport, or play with other boys. He spent much of his time either alone or with female cousins and their dolls.

Mishima&#x27;s father, Azusa, had a taste for military discipline, and worried Natsuko&#x27;s style of childrearing was too soft. When Mishima was returned to his immediate family at the age of 12, Azusa employed extreme parenting tactics, such as holding young Mishima up close to the side of a speeding steam locomotive. He also raided his son&#x27;s room for evidence of an &quot;effeminate&quot; interest in literature, and often ripped his son&#x27;s manuscripts apart. Although Azusa forbade him from writing any further stories, Mishima continued to write in secret, supported and protected by his mother, who was always the first to read a new story.

When Mishima was 13, Natsuko took him to see his first Kabuki play: The Treasury of Loyal Retainers, an allegory of the story of the 47 Rōnin. He was later taken to his first Noh play (&quot;Miwa&quot;, a story featuring Amano-Iwato) by his maternal grandmother . From these early experiences, Mishima became addicted to Kabuki and Noh. He began attending performances every month and grew deeply interested in these traditional Japanese dramatic art forms.

===Schooling and early works===

Mishima was enrolled at the age of six in the elite Gakushūin, the Peers&#x27; School in Tokyo, which had been established in the Meiji period to educate the Imperial family and the descendants of the old feudal nobility. Mishima began to write his first stories aged 12, taking inspiration from myths (Kojiki, Greek mythology, etc.) and the works of numerous classic Japanese authors, as well as Raymond Radiguet, Jean Cocteau, Oscar Wilde, Rainer Maria Rilke, Thomas Mann, Friedrich Nietzsche, Charles Baudelaire, l&#x27;Isle-Adam, and other European authors. He also studied German. After six years as a pupil, he became the youngest member of the editorial board of its literary society. Mishima was particularly drawn to the works of Japanese poet , Haruo Satō, and Michizō Tachihara, who inspired Mishima&#x27;s appreciation of classical Japanese &quot;waka&quot; poetry. Mishima&#x27;s early contributions to the Gakushūin literary magazine included &quot;haiku&quot; and &quot;waka&quot; poetry before he turned his attention to prose.

In 1941, at the age of 16, Mishima was invited to write a short story for the &quot;Hojinkai-zasshi&quot;, where he submitted , a story in which the narrator describes the feeling that his ancestors somehow still live on within him. The story displays several metaphors and aphorisms that would become Mishima&#x27;s hallmarks. He also sent a copy of the manuscript to his teacher , who was so impressed that he and his fellow editorial board members decided to publish it in their literary magazine .

In order to protect him from potential backlash from Azusa, Shimizu and the other editorial board members coined the pen-name Yukio Mishima. They took &quot;Mishima&quot; from Mishima Station, which Shimizu and fellow &quot;Bungei Bunka&quot; board member Hasuda Zenmei passed through on their way to the editorial meeting, which was held in Izu, Shizuoka. The name &quot;Yukio&quot; came from &quot;yuki&quot; (雪), the Japanese word for &quot;snow&quot;, because of the snow they saw on Mount Fuji as the train passed. The story was later published as a limited book edition (4,000 copies) in 1944 due to a wartime paper shortage. Mishima had it published as a keepsake to remember him by, as he assumed that he would die in the war.

In the editorial notes of &quot;Bungei Bunka&quot; magazine in 1941, when this debut work was serialized, Hasuda praised Mishima&#x27;s genius: &quot;This youthful author is a heaven-sent child of eternal Japanese history. He is much younger than we are, but has arrived on the scene already quite mature.&quot; Hasuda, who became something of a mentor to Mishima, was an ardent nationalist and a fan of Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801), a scholar of &quot;kokugaku&quot; from the Edo period who preached Japanese traditional values and devotion to the Emperor. Hasuda had previously fought for the Imperial Japanese Army in China in 1938, and in 1943 he was recalled to active service for deployment as a first lieutenant in the Southeast Asian theater. At a farewell party thrown for Hasuda by the &quot;Bungei Bunka&quot; group, Hasuda offered the following parting words to Mishima: &quot;I have entrusted the future of Japan to you.&quot; According to Mishima, these words were deeply meaningful to him, and had a profound effect on the future course of his life.

Later in 1941, Mishima wrote an essay about his deep devotion to Shintō, titled . Mishima&#x27;s story , published in 1946, describes a homosexual love he felt at school and being teased from members of the school&#x27;s rugby union club because he belonged to the literary society. Another story from 1954, , was similarly based on Mishima&#x27;s memories of his time at Gakushūin Junior High School.

On 9 September 1944, Mishima graduated Gakushūin High School at the top of the class, becoming a graduate representative. Emperor Hirohito was present at the graduation ceremony, with Mishima later receiving a silver watch from the Emperor at the Imperial Household Ministry.

On 27 April 1944, during the final years of World War II, Mishima received a draft notice for the Imperial Japanese Army, barely passing his conscription examination on 16 May 1944 with a less desirable rating of &quot;second class&quot; conscript. Scholars have argued that Mishima&#x27;s failure to receive a &quot;first class&quot; rating on his conscription examination (reserved only for the most physically fit recruits), in combination with the illness which led him to be erroneously declared unfit for duty, contributed to an inferiority complex over his frail constitution that later led to his obsession with physical fitness and bodybuilding.

Mishima had a cold during his medical check on convocation day (10 February 1945), which the army doctor misdiagnosed as tuberculosis; Mishima was consequently declared unfit for service and sent home. Mishima would later hint in his quasi-autobiographical novel &quot;Confessions of a Mask&quot; (1949) that he might have lied to the doctor in order to secure the misdiagnosis. Mishima wrote:

Why had I looked so frank as I lied to the army doctor? Why had I said that I&#x27;d been having a slight fever for over half a year, that my shoulder was painfully stiff, that I spit blood, that even last night I had been soaked by a night sweat?...Why when sentenced to return home the same day had I felt the pressure of a smile come pushing so persistently at my lips that I had difficulty in concealing it? Why had I run so when I was through the barracks gate? Hadn&#x27;t my hopes been blasted? What was the matter that I hadn&#x27;t hung my head and trudged away with heavy feet? I realized vividly that my future life would never attain heights of glory sufficient to justify my having escaped death in the army...

The veracity of this account is impossible to know for certain, but what is unquestionable is that Mishima did not speak out against the doctor&#x27;s diagnosis of tuberculosis. Researchers have speculated that Mishima&#x27;s guilt at allowing himself to escape death in the war left a lasting impression on his life and writing, possibly contributing to his later suicide.

The day before his failed medical examination, Mishima had written a farewell message to his family, ending with the words , including hair and nail clippings as mementos for his parents. The unit that Mishima would have enlisted in was eventually sent to the Philippines, with few survivors. Mishima&#x27;s parents were ecstatic that he did not have to go to war, but Mishima&#x27;s mood was harder to read, and Mishima&#x27;s mother overheard him express a wish that he could have joined a &quot;Special Attack&quot; unit. He also expressed an admiration for kamikaze pilots and other &quot;special attack&quot; units. In a 21 April 1945 letter to a friend, Mishima wrote:
It was through the kamikazes that &quot;modern man&quot; has finally been able to grasp the dawning of the &quot;present day&quot;, or perhaps better said, &quot;our historical era&quot; in a true sense, and for the first time the intellectual class, which until now had been the illegitimate child of modernity, became the legitimate heir of history. I believe that all of this is thanks to the kamikazes. This is the reason why the entire cultural class of Japan, and all people of culture around the world, should kneel before the kamikazes and offer up prayers of gratitude.

Mishima was deeply affected by Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s radio broadcast announcing Japan&#x27;s surrender on 15 August 1945, vowing to protect Japanese cultural traditions and help rebuild Japanese culture after the destruction of the war. He wrote in his diary, &quot;Only by preserving Japanese irrationality will we be able contribute to world culture 100 years from now.

Four days after Japan&#x27;s surrender, Mishima&#x27;s mentor Zenmei Hasuda, who had been drafted and deployed to the Malay peninsula, shot and killed his superior officer, who blamed Japan&#x27;s defeat on the Emperor. Hasuda had long suspected the officer to be a Korean spy. After shooting him, Hasuda turned his pistol on himself. Mishima learned of the incident a year later and contributed poetry in Hasuda&#x27;s honor at a memorial service in November 1946. On 23 October 1945 (Showa 20), Mishima&#x27;s beloved younger sister Mitsuko died suddenly at the age of 17 from typhoid fever after drinking untreated water. Around the same time, he also learned that , a classmate&#x27;s sister whom he had hoped to marry, was engaged to another man. Mishima used these events as inspiration and motivation for his later literary work.

At the end of the war, his father Azusa &quot;half-allowed&quot; Mishima to become a novelist. He was worried that his son would become a professional novelist, preferring instead that his son follow in the footsteps of himself and Mishima&#x27;s grandfather Sadatarō and become a bureaucrat. To this end, he advised his son to enroll in the Faculty of Law instead of the literature department. Attending lectures during the day and writing at night, Mishima graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1947. He obtained a position in the Ministry of the Treasury and was set for a promising career as a government bureaucrat. However, after just one year of employment, Mishima had exhausted himself so much that his father agreed to allow him to resign from his post and devote himself to writing full time.

In 1945, Mishima began the short story and continued to work on it throughout World War II. After the war, the story was praised by poet , whom Mishima respected.

===Post-war literature===

After Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the country was occupied by the U.S.-led Allied Powers. At the urging of the occupation authorities, many people who held important posts in various fields were purged from public office. The media and publishing industry were also censored, and were not allowed to engage in forms of expression reminiscent of wartime Japanese nationalism. In addition, literary figures, including many of those who had been close to Mishima before the end of the war, were branded &quot;war criminal literary figures&quot;. In response, many prominent literary figures became leftists, joined the Communist Party as a reaction against wartime militarism, and began writing socialist realist literature that might support the cause of socialist revolution. These newly converted leftists held great influence in the Japanese literary world immediately following the end of the war, which Mishima found difficult to accept, and he denounced them as &quot;opportunists&quot; in letters to friends. Although Mishima was just 20 years old at this time, he worried that his type of literature, based on the 1930s , had already become obsolete.

Mishima had heard that famed writer Yasunari Kawabata had praised his work before the end of the war. Uncertain of who else to turn to, Mishima took the manuscripts for and with him, visited Kawabata in Kamakura, and asked for his advice and assistance in January 1946. Kawabata was impressed, and in June 1946, following Kawabata&#x27;s recommendation, &quot;The Cigarette&quot; was published in the new literary magazine , followed by &quot;The Middle Ages&quot; in December 1946. &quot;The Middle Ages&quot; is set in Japan&#x27;s historical Muromachi Period and explores the motif of &quot;shudō&quot; (man-boy love) against a backdrop of the death of the ninth Ashikaga shogun Ashikaga Yoshihisa in battle at the age of 25, and his father Ashikaga Yoshimasa&#x27;s resultant sadness. The story features the fictional character Kikuwaka, a beautiful teenage boy who was beloved by both Yoshihisa and Yoshimasa, who fails in an attempt to follow Yoshihisa in death by committing suicide. Thereafter, Kikuwaka devotes himself to spiritualism in an attempt to heal Yoshimasa&#x27;s sadness by allowing Yoshihisa&#x27;s ghost to possess his body, and eventually dies in a double-suicide with a &quot;miko&quot; (shrine maiden) who falls in love with him. Mishima wrote the story in an elegant style drawing upon medieval Japanese literature and the &quot;Ryōjin Hishō&quot;, a collection of medieval &quot;imayō&quot; songs. This elevated writing style and the homosexual motif suggest the germ of Mishima&#x27;s later aesthetics. Later in 1948 Kawabata, who praised this work, published an autobiographical work describing his experience of falling in love for the first time with a boy two years his junior.
In 1946, Mishima began his first novel, , a story about two young members of the aristocracy drawn towards suicide. It was published in 1948, and placed Mishima in the ranks of the Second Generation of Postwar Writers. The following year, he published &quot;Confessions of a Mask&quot;, a semi-autobiographical account of a young homosexual man who hides behind a mask to fit into society. The novel was extremely successful and made Mishima a celebrity at the age of 24. In 1947, a brief encounter with Osamu Dazai, a popular novelist known for his suicidal themes, left a lasting impression on him. Around 1949, Mishima also published a literary essay about Kawabata, for whom he had always held a deep appreciation, in .

Mishima enjoyed international travel. In 1952, he took a world tour and published his travelogue as . He visited Greece during his travels, a place which had fascinated him since childhood. His visit to Greece became the basis for his 1954 novel &quot;The Sound of Waves&quot;, which drew inspiration from the Greek legend of Daphnis and Chloe.&quot; The Sound of Waves&quot;, set on the small island of &quot;Kami-shima&quot; where a traditional Japanese lifestyle continued to be practiced, depicts a pure, simple love between a fisherman and a female pearl and abalone diver. Although the novel became a best-seller, leftists criticized it for &quot;glorifying old-fashioned Japanese values&quot;, and some people began calling Mishima a &quot;fascist&quot;. Looking back on these attacks in later years, Mishima wrote, &quot;The ancient community ethics portrayed in this novel were attacked by progressives at the time, but no matter how much the Japanese people changed, these ancient ethics lurk in the bottom of their hearts. We have gradually seen this proven to be the case.&quot;
Mishima made use of contemporary events in many of his works. &quot;The Temple of the Golden Pavilion&quot;, published in 1956, is a fictionalization of the burning down of the Kinkaku-ji Buddhist temple in Kyoto in 1950 by a mentally disturbed monk.

In 1959, Mishima published the artistically ambitious novel &quot;Kyōko no Ie&quot;. The novel tells the interconnected stories of four young men who represented four different facets of Mishima&#x27;s personality. His athletic side appears as a boxer, his artistic side as a painter, his narcissistic, performative side as an actor, and his secretive, nihilistic side as a businessman who goes through the motions of living a normal life while practicing &quot;absolute contempt for reality&quot;. According to Mishima, he was attempting to describe the time around 1955 in the novel, when Japan was entering into its era of high economic growth and the phrase &quot;The postwar is over&quot; was prevalent. Mishima explained, &quot;&quot;Kyōko no Ie&quot; is, so to speak, my research into the nihilism within me.&quot; Although the novel was well received by a small number of critics from the same generation as Mishima and sold 150,000 copies in a month, it was widely panned in broader literary circles, and was rapidly branded as Mishima&#x27;s first &quot;failed work&quot;. It was Mishima&#x27;s first major setback as an author, and the book&#x27;s disastrous reception came as a harsh psychological blow.

Until 1960, Mishima had not written works that were seen as especially political. In the summer of 1960, Mishima became interested in the massive Anpo protests against an attempt by U.S.-backed Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi to revise the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan (known as &quot;Anpo&quot; in Japanese) in order to cement the U.S.–Japan military alliance into place. Although he did not directly participate in the protests, he often went out in the streets to observe the protestors in action and kept extensive newspaper clippings covering the protests. In June 1960, at the climax of the protest movement, Mishima wrote a commentary in the &quot;Mainichi Shinbun&quot; newspaper, entitled &quot;A Political Opinion&quot;. In the critical essay, he argued that leftist groups such as the Zengakuren student federation, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party were falsely wrapping themselves in the banner of &quot;defending democracy&quot; and using the protest movement to further their own ends. Mishima warned against the dangers of the Japanese people following ideologues who told lies with honeyed words. Although Mishima criticized Kishi as a &quot;nihilist&quot; who had subordinated himself to the United States, Mishima concluded that he would rather vote for a strong-willed realist &quot;with neither dreams nor despair&quot; than a mendacious but eloquent ideologue.

Shortly after the Anpo Protests ended, Mishima began writing one of his most famous short stories, &quot;Patriotism&quot;, glorifying the actions of a young right-wing ultranationalist Japanese army officer who commits suicide after a failed revolt against the government during the February 26 Incident. The following year, he published the first two parts of his three-part play , which celebrates the actions of the 26 February revolutionaries.

Mishima&#x27;s newfound interest in contemporary politics shaped his novel &quot;After the Banquet&quot;, also published in 1960, which so closely followed the events surrounding politician Hachirō Arita&#x27;s campaign to become governor of Tokyo that Mishima was sued for invasion of privacy. The next year, Mishima published &quot;The Frolic of the Beasts&quot;, a parody of the classical Noh play &quot;Motomezuka&quot;, written in the 14th-century by playwright Kiyotsugu Kan&#x27;ami. In 1962, Mishima produced his most artistically avant-garde work &quot;Beautiful Star&quot;, which at times comes close to science fiction. Although the novel received mixed reviews from the literary world, prominent critic singled it out for praise as part of a new breed of novels that was overthrowing longstanding literary conventions in the tumultuous aftermath of the Anpo Protests. Alongside Kōbō Abe&#x27;s &quot;Woman of the Dunes&quot;, published that same year, Okuno considered &quot;A Beautiful Star&quot; an &quot;epoch-making work&quot; which broke free of literary taboos and preexisting notions of what literature should be in order to explore the author&#x27;s personal creativity.

In 1965, Mishima wrote the play &quot;Madame de Sade&quot; that explores the complex figure of the Marquis de Sade, traditionally upheld as an exemplar of vice, through a series of debates between six female characters, including the Marquis&#x27; wife, the Madame de Sade. At the end of the play, Mishima offers his own interpretation of what he considered to be one of the central mysteries of the de Sade story—the Madame de Sade&#x27;s unstinting support for her husband while he was in prison and her sudden decision to renounce him upon his release. Mishima&#x27;s play was inspired in part by his friend Tatsuhiko Shibusawa&#x27;s 1960 Japanese translation of the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s novel &quot;Juliette&quot; and a 1964 biography Shibusawa wrote of de Sade. Shibusawa&#x27;s sexually explicit translation became the focus of a sensational obscenity trial remembered in Japan as the , which was ongoing as Mishima wrote the play. In 1994, &quot;Madame de Sade&quot; was evaluated as the &quot;greatest drama in the history of postwar theater&quot; by Japanese theater criticism magazine .

Mishima was considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1963, 1964, 1965, 1967 and 1968 (he and Rudyard Kipling are both the youngest nominees in history), and was a favorite of many foreign publications. However, in 1968 his early mentor Kawabata won the Nobel Prize and Mishima realized that the chances of it being given to another Japanese author in the near future were slim. In a work published in 1970, Mishima wrote that the writers he paid most attention to in modern western literature were Georges Bataille, Pierre Klossowski, and Witold Gombrowicz.

===Acting and modelling===

Mishima was also an actor, and starred in Yasuzo Masumura&#x27;s 1960 film, &quot;Afraid to Die&quot;, for which he also sang the theme song (lyrics by himself; music by Shichirō Fukazawa). He performed in films like &quot;Patriotism or the Rite of Love and Death&quot; directed by himself, 1966, &quot;Black Lizard&quot; directed by Kinji Fukasaku, 1968 and &quot;Hitokiri&quot; directed by Hideo Gosha, 1969. Maki Isaka has discussed how his knowledge of performance and theatrical forms influenced short stories including . 

Mishima was featured as the photo model in photographer Eikoh Hosoe&#x27;s book , as well as in Tamotsu Yatō&#x27;s photobooks and . American author Donald Richie gave an eyewitness account of seeing Mishima, dressed in a loincloth and armed with a sword, posing in the snow for one of Tamotsu Yatō&#x27;s photoshoots.

In the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Heibon Punch&quot;, to which Mishima had contributed various essays and criticisms, he won first place in the &quot;Mr. Dandy&quot; reader popularity poll in 1967 with 19,590 votes, beating second place Toshiro Mifune by 720 votes. In the next reader popularity poll, &quot;Mr. International&quot;, Mishima ranked second behind French President Charles de Gaulle. At that time in the late 1960s, Mishima was the first celebrity to be described as a &quot;superstar&quot; (&quot;sūpāsutā&quot;) by the Japanese media.

===Private life===

In 1955, Mishima took up weight training to overcome his weak constitution, and his strictly observed workout regimen of three sessions per week was not disrupted for the final 15 years of his life. In his 1968 essay &quot;Sun and Steel&quot;, Mishima deplored the emphasis given by intellectuals to the mind over the body. He later became very skilled (5th Dan) at kendo (traditional Japanese swordsmanship), and became 2nd Dan in battōjutsu, and 1st Dan in karate. In 1956, he tried boxing for a short period of time. In the same year, he developed an interest in UFOs and became a member of the . In 1954, he fell in love with , who became the model for main characters in and . Mishima hoped to marry her, but they broke up in 1957.

After briefly considering marriage with Michiko Shōda, who later married Crown Prince Akihito and became Empress Michiko, Mishima married , the daughter of Japanese-style painter Yasushi Sugiyama on 1 June 1958. The couple had two children: a daughter named (born 2 June 1959) and a son named (born 2 May 1962). Noriko eventually married the diplomat Koji Tomita.

While working on his novel &quot;Forbidden Colors&quot;, Mishima visited gay bars in Japan. Mishima&#x27;s sexual orientation was an issue that bothered his wife, and she always denied his homosexuality after his death. In 1998, the writer published an account of his relationship with Mishima in 1951, including fifteen letters (not love letters) from Mishima. Mishima&#x27;s children successfully sued Fukushima and the publisher for copyright violation over the use of Mishima&#x27;s letters. Publisher &quot;Bungeishunjū&quot; had argued that the contents of the letters were &quot;practical correspondence&quot; rather than copyrighted works. However, the ruling for the plaintiffs declared, &quot;In addition to clerical content, these letters describe the Mishima&#x27;s own feelings, his aspirations, and his views on life, in different words from those in his literary works.&quot;

In February 1961, Mishima became embroiled in the aftermath of the Shimanaka incident. In 1960, the author Shichirō Fukazawa had published the satirical short story in the mainstream magazine &quot;Chūō Kōron&quot;. It contained a dream sequence (in which the Emperor and Empress are beheaded by a guillotine) that led to outrage from right-wing ultra-nationalist groups, and numerous death threats against Fukazawa, any writers believed to have been associated with him, and &quot;Chūō Kōron&quot; magazine itself. On 1 February 1961, Kazutaka Komori, a seventeen-year-old rightist, broke into the home of Hōji Shimanaka, the president of &quot;Chūō Kōron&quot;, killed his maid with a knife and severely wounded his wife. In the aftermath, Fukazawa went into hiding, and dozens of writers and literary critics, including Mishima, were provided with round-the-clock police protection for several months; Mishima was included because a rumor that Mishima had personally recommended &quot;The Tale of an Elegant Dream&quot; for publication became widespread, and even though he repeatedly denied the claim, he received hundreds of death threats. In later years, Mishima harshly criticized Komori, arguing that those who harm women and children are neither patriots nor traditional right-wingers, and that an assassination attempt should be a one-on-one confrontation with the victim at the risk of the assassin&#x27;s life. Mishima also argued that it was the custom of traditional Japanese patriots (such as Otoya Yamaguchi) to immediately commit suicide after committing an assassination.

In 1963, occurred within the theatrical troupe Bungakuza, to which Mishima belonged. He wrote a play titled , but star actress Haruko Sugimura and other Communist Party-affiliated actors refused to perform because the protagonist held anti-communist views and mentioned criticism about a conspiracy of world communism in his lines. As a result of this ideological conflict, Mishima quit Bungakuza and later formed the troupe with playwrights and actors who had quit Bungakuza along with him, including , , and Nobuo Nakamura. When Neo Littérature Théâtre experienced a schism in 1968, Mishima formed another troupe, the , and worked with Matsuura and Nakamura again.

During the Tokyo Olympics in 1964, Mishima interviewed various athletes every day and wrote articles as a newspaper correspondent. He had eagerly anticipated the long-awaited return of the Olympics to Japan after the 1940 Tokyo Olympics were cancelled due to Japan&#x27;s war in China. Mishima expressed his excitement in his report on the opening ceremonies: &quot;It can be said that ever since Lafcadio Hearn called the Japanese &quot;the Greeks of the Orient&quot;, the Olympics were destined to be hosted by Japan someday.&quot;

Mishima hated Ryokichi Minobe, who was a socialist and the governor of Tokyo beginning in 1967. Influential persons in the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), including Takeo Fukuda and Kiichi Aichi, had been Mishima&#x27;s superiors during his time at the Ministry of the Treasury, and Prime Minister Eisaku Satō came to know Mishima because his wife, Hiroko, was a fan of Mishima&#x27;s work. Based on these connections LDP officials solicited Mishima to run for the LDP as governor of Tokyo against Minobe, but Mishima had no intention of becoming a politician.

Mishima was fond of manga and gekiga, especially the drawing style of Hiroshi Hirata, a mangaka best known for his samurai gekiga; the slapstick, absurdist comedy in Fujio Akatsuka&#x27;s &quot;Mōretsu Atarō&quot;; and the imaginativeness of Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s &quot;GeGeGe no Kitarō&quot;. Mishima especially loved reading the boxing manga &quot;Ashita no Joe&quot; in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; every week. &quot;Ultraman&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot; were his favorite kaiju fantasies, and he once compared himself to &quot;Godzilla&#x27;s egg&quot; in 1955. On the other hand, he disliked story manga with humanist or cosmopolitan themes, such as Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Phoenix&quot;.

Mishima was a fan of science fiction, contending that &quot;science fiction will be the first literature to completely overcome modern humanism&quot;. He praised Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; in particular. While acknowledging &quot;inexpressible unpleasant and uncomfortable feelings after reading it,&quot; he declared, &quot;I&#x27;m not afraid to call it a masterpiece.&quot;

Mishima traveled to Shimoda on the Izu Peninsula with his wife and children every summer from 1964 onwards. In Shimoda, Mishima often enjoyed eating local seafood with his friend Henry Scott-Stokes. Mishima never showed any hostility towards the US in front of foreign friends like Scott-Stokes, until Mishima heard that the name of the inn where Scott-Stokes was staying was Kurofune (), at which point his voice suddenly became low and he said in a sullen manner, &quot;Why? Why do you stay at a place with such a name?&quot;. Mishima liked ordinary American people after the war, and he and his wife had even visited Disneyland as newlyweds. However, he clearly retained a strong sense of hostility toward the &quot;black ships&quot; of Commodore Matthew C. Perry, who forcibly opened Japan up to unequal international relations at the end of the Edo period, and had destroyed the peace of Edo, where vivid chōnin culture was flourishing.

===Later life===

Mishima&#x27;s nationalism grew towards the end of his life. In 1966, he published his short story , in which he denounced Emperor Hirohito for renouncing his own divinity after World War II. Mishima argued that the soldiers who had died in the February 26 Incident and the &quot;Kamikaze&quot; had died for their &quot;living god&quot; Emperor, and that Hirohito&#x27;s renunciation of his own divinity meant that all those deaths had been in vain.

In February 1967, Mishima joined fellow authors Yasunari Kawabata, Kōbō Abe, and Jun Ishikawa in issuing a statement condemning China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution for suppressing academic and artistic freedom. However, only one Japanese newspaper carried the full text of their statement.

In September 1967 Mishima and his wife visited India at the invitation of the Indian government. He traveled widely and met with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and President Zakir Hussain. He left extremely impressed by Indian culture, and what he felt was the Indian people&#x27;s determination to resist Westernization and protect traditional ways. Mishima feared that his fellow Japanese were too enamored of modernization and western-style materialism to protect traditional Japanese culture. On his way home from India, Mishima also stopped in Thailand and Laos; his experiences in the three nations became the basis for portions of his novel &quot;The Temple of Dawn&quot;, the third in his tetralogy &quot;The Sea of Fertility&quot;.

In a series of critical essays in the late 1960s, Mishima exalted what he viewed as traditional Japanese values. In 1967, he published , an impassioned plea for a return to bushido, the putative &quot;samurai code&quot; of Japan&#x27;s past. Mishima praised the &quot;Hagakure&quot;, a treatise on warrior virtues authored by the samurai Yamamoto Tsunetomo during the Edo period that valorized the warrior&#x27;s willingness to die, as being at the core of his literary production and &quot;the source of his vitality as a writer&quot;. Mishima concluded, What &quot;Hagakure&quot; is insisting is that even a merciless death, a futile death that bears neither flower nor fruit, has dignity as the death of a human being. If we value so highly the dignity of life, how can we not also value the dignity of death? No death may be called futile.

In , Mishima preached the centrality of the Emperor to Japanese culture, and argued that Japan&#x27;s postwar era was a time of flashy but ultimately hollow prosperity (a &quot;Shōwa Genroku&quot;), lacking any truly transcendent literary or poetic talents comparable to the 18th century masters of the original Genroku era, such as the playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon or the poet Matsuo Bashō.

In 1968, Mishima wrote a play titled &quot;My Friend Hitler&quot;, in which he depicted the historical figures of Adolf Hitler, Gustav Krupp, Gregor Strasser, and Ernst Röhm as mouthpieces to express his own views on fascism and beauty. Mishima explained that after writing the all-female play &quot;Madame de Sade,&quot; he wanted to write a counterpart play with an all-male cast. Mishima wrote of &quot;My Friend Hitler,&quot; &quot;You may read this tragedy as an allegory of the relationship between Ōkubo Toshimichi and Saigō Takamori&quot; (two heroes of Japan&#x27;s Meiji Restoration who initially worked together but later had a falling out). Given the play&#x27;s provocative title, Mishima was repeatedly asked if he intended to express admiration or support for Hitler. Mishima wrote in a program note,To be honest, I feel a terrifying interest in Hitler, but if the question is whether I like or dislike him, I can only answer, I don&#x27;t like him. Hitler was a political genius but was not a hero. He thoroughly lacked the refreshing, sunny quality indispensable to becoming a hero. Hitler is as gloomy as the twentieth century.

That same year, he wrote &quot;Life for Sale&quot;, a humorous story about a man who, after failing to commit suicide, advertises his life for sale. In a review of the English translation, novelist Ian Thomson called it a &quot;pulp noir&quot; and a &quot;sexy, camp delight&quot;, but also noted that, &quot;beneath the hard-boiled dialogue and the gangster high jinks is a familiar indictment of consumerist Japan and a romantic yearning for the past.&quot;

Like many other right-wingers, Mishima was extremely alarmed by the riots and revolutionary actions undertaken by radical &quot;New Left&quot; university students, who took over dozens of college campuses in Japan in 1968 and 1969. On 25 February 1968, he and several other right-wingers met at the editorial offices of the recently founded &quot;minzoku-ha&quot; monthly magazine , where they pricked their little fingers and signed a blood oath promising to die if necessary to prevent a left-wing revolution from occurring in Japan. Mishima showed his sincerity by signing his birth name, Kimitake Hiraoka, in his own blood.

On May 13, 1969, Mishima accepted an invitation to debate with members of the Tokyo University Zenkyōtō on the university&#x27;s Komaba campus. This debate lasted for 2.5 hours, with both Mishima and the students treating each other amiably and with respect, despite Mishima&#x27;s initial fears that the students might kill him on the spot for his right-wing views. At this debate, Mishima told the students, &quot;As long as you refer to the Emperor as &#x27;Emperor,&#x27; I will gladly join forces with you,&quot; but in the end the ideological differences between Mishima and the students could not be overcome. Mishima ended by saying, &quot;I believe in your passion. I believe in this alone. Even if I believe in nothing else of yours, I want you to know that I believe in this alone.&quot; In an essay written after the debate Mishima said that &quot;they could not escape established leftist thinking&quot; and that &quot;the discussion was inevitably at a stalemate.&quot; In this essay, Mishima argued that the supposedly revolutionary Zenkyōtō were themselves &quot;weakening the roots of the revolutionary ideal in Japan&quot; by rejecting the idea of the &quot;Emperor&quot;, which Mishima claimed was also &quot;a revolutionary ideal deeply rooted in the consciousness of the Japanese people.&quot; Mishima&#x27;s friends interpreted this essay as him expressing his disappointment with the Zenkyōtō.

Throughout this period, Mishima continued to work on his magnum opus, &quot;The Sea of Fertility&quot; tetralogy of novels, which began appearing in a monthly serialized format in September 1965. The four completed novels were &quot;Spring Snow&quot; (1969), &quot;Runaway Horses&quot; (1969), &quot;The Temple of Dawn&quot; (1970), and &quot;The Decay of the Angel&quot; (published posthumously in 1971). Mishima aimed for a very long novel with a completely different &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; from Western chronicle novels of the 19th and 20th centuries; rather than telling the story of a single individual or family, Mishima boldly set his goal as interpreting the entire human world. In &quot;The Decay of the Angel&quot;, four stories convey the transmigration of the human soul as the main character goes through a series of reincarnations. Mishima hoped to express in literary terms something akin to pantheism. Novelist Paul Theroux blurbed the first edition of the English translation of &quot;The Sea of Fertility&quot; as &quot;the most complete vision we have of Japan in the twentieth century&quot; and critic Charles Solomon wrote in 1990 that &quot;the four novels remain one of the outstanding works of 20th-Century literature and a summary of the author&#x27;s life and work&quot;.

===Coup attempt and suicide===
From 12 April to 27 May 1967, Mishima underwent basic training with the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF). Mishima had originally lobbied to train with the GSDF for six months, but was met with resistance from the Defense Agency. Mishima&#x27;s training period was finalized to 46 days, which required using some of his connections. His participation in GSDF training was kept secret, both because the Defense Agency did not want to give the impression that anyone was receiving special treatment, and because Mishima wanted to experience &quot;real&quot; military life. Accordingly, Mishima trained under his birth name, Kimitake Hiraoka, and most of his fellow soldiers did not recognize him.

From June 1967, Mishima became a leading figure in a plan to create a 10,000-man as a civilian complement to Japan&#x27;s Self Defense Forces. He began leading groups of right-wing college students to undergo basic training with the GSDF in the hope of training 100 officers to lead the National Guard.

Finding that his plan for a large-scale Japan National Guard with broad public and private support had failed to catch on, Mishima formed the Tatenokai (&quot;Shield Society&quot;), a private militia composed primarily of right-wing college students, on 5 October 1968. Mishima accepted no outside money, and funded the activities of the Tatenokai using royalties from his writing. The Tatenokai primarily focused on martial training and physical fitness, including traditional kendo sword-fighting and long-distance running. Mishima personally oversaw this training. Initial membership was around 50, and was drawn primarily from students from Waseda University and individuals affiliated with the &quot;Controversy Journal&quot;. The number of Tatenokai members was later increased to exactly 100.
On 25 November 1970, Mishima and four members of the Tatenokai—Masakatsu Morita, , , and Hiroyasu Koga—used a pretext to visit , the commandant of , a military base in central Tokyo and the headquarters of the Eastern Command of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Once inside, they barricaded Mashita&#x27;s office and tied the commandant to his chair. Mishima wore a white &quot;hachimaki&quot; headband with a red &quot;hinomaru&quot; circle in the center bearing the kanji for , a reference to the last words of Kusunoki Masasue, the younger brother of the 14th-century imperial loyalist samurai Kusunoki Masashige, as the two brothers died fighting to defend the Emperor.

Holding a prepared manifesto and a banner listing their demands, Mishima stepped out onto the balcony to address the soldiers gathered below. His speech was intended to inspire a coup d&#x27;état to restore direct rule to the emperor. He succeeded only in irritating the soldiers, and was heckled, with jeers and the noise of helicopters drowning out some parts of his speech. In his speech, Mishima rebuked the JSDF for their passive acceptance of a constitution that &quot;denies (their) own existence&quot; and shouted to rouse them, &quot;Where has the spirit of the samurai gone?&quot; In a final that Morita and Ogawa scattered copies of from the balcony, Mishima expressed his dissatisfaction with the half-baked nature of the JSDF: &quot;It is self-evident that the United States would not be pleased with a true Japanese volunteer army protecting the land of Japan.&quot;

After he finished reading his prepared speech in a few minutes&#x27; time, Mishima cried out three times. He then retreated into the commandant&#x27;s office and apologized to the commandant, saying, &quot;We did it to return the JSDF to the Emperor. I had no choice but to do this.&quot; Mishima then committed seppuku, a form of ritual suicide by disembowelment associated with the samurai. Morita had been assigned to serve as Mishima&#x27;s second (&quot;kaishakunin&quot;), cutting off his head with a sword at the end of the rite to spare him unnecessary pain. However, Morita proved unable to complete his task, and after three failed attempts to sever Mishima&#x27;s head, Hiroyasu Koga had to step in and complete the task.

According to the testimony of the surviving coup members, originally all four Tatenokai members had planned to commit seppuku along with Mishima. However, Mishima attempted to dissuade them and three of the members acquiesced to his wishes. Only Morita persisted, saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t let Mr. Mishima die alone.&quot; But Mishima knew that Morita had a girlfriend and still hoped he might live. Just before his seppuku, Mishima tried one more time to dissuade him, saying &quot;Morita, you must live, not die.&quot; Nevertheless, after Mishima&#x27;s seppuku, Morita knelt and stabbed himself in the abdomen and Koga acted as &quot;kaishakunin&quot; again. Another traditional element of the suicide ritual was the composition of death poems by the Tatenokai members prior to their entry into the headquarters.

This coup attempt is called the in Japan.

Mishima had planned his suicide meticulously for at least a year, with no one outside a small group of hand-picked Tatenokai members knowing of his plans. Mishima had made sure his affairs were in order and left money for the legal defense of the three surviving Tatenokai members involved in the incident. Mishima had also arranged for a department store to send his two children Christmas gifts every year until they became adults, and had asked a publisher to pay the long-term subscription fee for children&#x27;s magazines in advance and deliver them every month.

Much speculation has surrounded Mishima&#x27;s suicide. One of Mishima&#x27;s biographers, translator John Nathan, suggests that the coup attempt was only a pretext for the ritual suicide of which Mishima had long dreamed. Mishima&#x27;s friend Henry Scott-Stokes, another biographer, noted a meeting with Mishima in his diary entry for 3 September 1970 at which Mishima, with a dark expression on his face, said: Japan has lost its spiritual tradition, and instead has become infested with materialism. Japan is under the curse of a green snake now. The green snake is biting Japan&#x27;s chest. There is no way to escape this curse.
 Scott-Stokes told in 1990 that he took the &quot;green snake&quot; to mean the U.S. dollar.

One researcher has speculated that Mishima chose November 25 for his coup attempt in order to set his period of &quot;bardo&quot; until his reincarnation, such that 49th day after his death would coincide with his birthday, 14 January. Mishima&#x27;s remains were returned to his family the day after the incident, and were buried in the grave of the Hiraoka Family at Tama Cemetery on his birthday, 14 January 1971.

==Legacy==

Mishima has been recognized as one of the world&#x27;s most important literary persons of the 20th century. Mishima wrote 34 novels, approximately 50 plays and 25 books of short stories, more than 35 books of essays, plus a libretto and one film.
The annual Mishima Prize was established in 1998 by literary publisher Shinchōsha to recognise groundbreaking Japanese literature. On 3 July 1999, the opened in Yamanakako, Yamanashi Prefecture.

The Mishima Incident helped inspire the formation of groups in Japan, such as the &quot;Issuikai&quot;, founded by , who was one of Tatenokai members and Mishima&#x27;s follower. Compared to older pro-American, anti-communist groups such as Bin Akao&#x27;s Greater Japan Patriotic Party, New Right groups such as the Issuikai tended to emphasize ethnic nationalism and anti-Americanism.

A memorial service deathday for Mishima, called , is held every year in Japan on 25 November by the , as well as former members of the . A separate memorial service has also been held annually by former Tatenokai members from 1975 onwards, one year after Masahiro Ogawa, Masayoshi Koga, and Hiroyasu Koga were released on parole.

A variety of cenotaphs and memorial stones have been erected in honor of Mishima&#x27;s memory in various places around Japan. For example, stones have been erected at Hachiman Shrine in Kakogawa City, Hyogo Prefecture, where his grandfather&#x27;s permanent domicile was; in front of the 2nd company corps at JGSDF Camp Takigahara; and in one of Mishima&#x27;s acquaintance&#x27;s home garden. There is also a &quot;Monument of Honor Yukio Mishima &amp; Masakatsu Morita&quot; in front of the Rissho University Shonan High school in Shimane Prefecture.

The Mishima Yukio Shrine was built in the suburb of Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Prefecture, on 9 January 1983.

A 1985 biographical film by Paul Schrader titled &quot;&quot; depicts his life and work, however it has not had a theatrical release inside Japan. A 2012 Japanese film titled &quot;11:25 The Day He Chose His Own Fate&quot; examines Mishima&#x27;s final day. The 1983 gay pornographic film &quot;Beautiful Mystery&quot; satirized homosexual undertones that were present during Mishima&#x27;s career.

In 2020, a documentary titled was released, based on the debate between Mishima and members of the Tokyo University Zenkyōtō on May 13, 1969.

==Major works==
===Literature===
===Critical essay===
===Plays for classical Japanese theatre===
In addition to contemporary-style plays such as &quot;Madame de Sade&quot;, Mishima wrote for two of the three genres of classical Japanese theatre: Noh and Kabuki (as a proud Tokyoite, he would not even attend the Bunraku puppet theatre, always associated with Osaka and the provinces).

Though Mishima took themes, titles and characters from the Noh canon, his twists and modern settings, such as hospitals and ballrooms, startled audiences accustomed to the long-settled originals.

Donald Keene translated &quot;Five Modern Noh Plays&quot; (Tuttle, 1981; ). Most others remain untranslated and so lack an &quot;official&quot; English title; in such cases it is therefore preferable to use the rōmaji title.

===Films===
Mishima starred in multiple films. &quot;Patriotism&quot; was written and funded by himself, and he directed it in close cooperation with Masaki Domoto. Mishima also wrote a detailed account of the whole process, in which the particulars regarding costume, shooting expenses and the film&#x27;s reception are delved into. &quot;Patriotism&quot; won the second prize at the Tours International Short Film Festival in January 1966.

<text>Alkmaar () is a city and municipality in the Netherlands, located in the province of North Holland. Alkmaar is well known for its traditional cheese market. For tourists, it is a popular cultural destination. The municipality has a population of 111,766 as of 2023.

==History==

The earliest mention of the name Alkmaar is in a 10th-century document. As the village grew into a town, it was granted city rights in 1254. The oldest part of Alkmaar lies on an ancient sand bank a couple of meters (yards) above the surrounding region; it afforded some protection from inundation during medieval times. Its vicinage consists of some of the oldest polders in existence. Older spellings include Alckmar.

On June 24, 1572, after the Geuzen captured the town, five Franciscans from Alkmaar were taken to Enkhuizen and hanged, becoming the martyrs of Alkmaar.

===Siege of Alkmaar===
In 1573 the city underwent a siege by Spanish forces under the leadership of Don Fadrique, son of the Duke of Alva. The citizens sent urgent messages for help to the Prince of Orange; he responded by promising to open the floodgates of the dykes and flood the region if the need arose, which despite the protestations of the peasantry, fearful for their harvest, he proceeded to do.

Some of his dispatches fell into the hands of Don Fadrique, and, with the waters beginning to rise, the Spaniards raised the siege and fled. It was a turning point in the Eighty Years War and gave rise to the expression &quot;Bij Alkmaar begint de victorie&quot; (&quot;Victory begins at Alkmaar&quot;). The event is still celebrated every year in Alkmaar on 8 October, the day the siege ended.

===Since the French Revolutionary Wars===
In 1799, during the French Revolutionary Wars, an Anglo-Russian expeditionary force captured the city but was ultimately defeated in the Battle of Castricum. After that battle, on 18 October 1799, the two opposing sides held the Convention of Alkmaar which met to determine the fate of the defeated Anglo-Russian force. The French victory was commemorated on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris as &quot;Alkmaer&quot;.

The North Holland Canal, opened in 1824, was dug through Alkmaar. In 1865 and 1867 the railways between Alkmaar and Den Helder and between Alkmaar and Haarlem were built respectively.

In the second half of the 20th century, Alkmaar expanded quickly with development of new neighbourhoods. On 1 October 1972, the town of Oudorp and the southern portions of Koedijk and Sint Pancras were added to the municipality of Alkmaar.

==Administrative divisions==

The municipality of Alkmaar historically consists of the following cities, towns, villages and districts: Alkmaar, Bergermeer, Daalmeer, De Hoef, De Horn, De Nollen, Het Rak, Huiswaard, Koedijk (southeastern part), Overdie, Oudorp and Omval. On 1 January 2015 the municipalities of Graft-De Rijp and Schermer were merged into Alkmaar. The historical village of De Rijp is thus since a part of Alkmaar.

These once separate villages are now all linked together by the suburban sprawl of buildings that arose between the late 1970s and early 1990s. During this time, the population of Alkmaar almost doubled.

==Local government==
The municipal council of Alkmaar consists of 39 seats, which are divided as follows after the 2022 elections:

* D66 – 5 seats
* OPA – 5 seats
* GroenLinks – 5 seats
* BAS – 4 seats
* VVD – 4 seats
* PvdA – 3 seats
* CDA – 3 seats
* Leefbaar Alkmaar – 3 seats
* Partij voor de Dieren – 2 seats
* Senior&#x27;s Party of Alkmaar (Senioren Partij Alkmaar) – 2 seats
* FvD – 1 seat
* SP – 1 seat
* ChristenUnie - 1 seat

==Transport==

The A9 motorway runs from Amsterdam to Alkmaar, then continues on to Den Helder as the N9.

There are direct trains to Den Helder, Hoorn, Zaandam, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Ede, Arnhem, Nijmegen, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, Eindhoven, Maastricht and Haarlem. For exact details see Alkmaar railway station.

Alkmaar has two railway stations:

* Alkmaar
* Alkmaar Noord

The waterway Noordhollandsch Kanaal, which opened in 1824, runs through Alkmaar. . it can be crossed (among other ways) using two of the five operating vlotbruggen, Koedijkervlotbrug and Rekervlotbrug.

==Main sights==
Alkmaar has many medieval buildings that are still intact, most notably the tall tower of the Grote or Sint-Laurenskerk, where many people from Alkmaar hold wedding ceremonies. The other main attraction, especially in the summer months, is Alkmaar&#x27;s cheese market at the Waagplein, one of the country&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions. The cheese market traditionally takes place from the first Friday in April through the first Friday in September. Every Friday morning (10:00–12:30) the Waagplein is the backdrop for this traditional cheese market. After the old-fashioned way of the hand clap, traders and carriers will weigh the cheeses. It is one of only four traditional Dutch cheese markets still in existence. The traditional fare of this cheese market is those cheeses made in the local area, as opposed to the well-known brands of Dutch cheeses, including the Edam and Gouda cheeses. It is not actually possible to buy cheese at the market itself, which is really only a demonstration of how this merchants&#x27; market operated in times gone by. However, the demonstration, which takes place in front of the medieval weighing house, is surrounded by many specialized stalls where it is possible to buy all kinds of cheese (and non-cheese) related products. The Waag is also home to the local tourist office and a cheese museum. Alkmaar has 399 registered rijksmonuments, of which most are situated along the city&#x27;s old canals.

Alkmaar has two large theatres and a big cinema (which was originally two cinemas). A red light district is situated at the Achterdam, and Alkmaar has a nightlife scene as well which takes place in the pubs in front of the cheesemarket. Every year, at the end of May Alkmaar hosts the four-day event Alkmaar Pride, which has a canal pride parade on Saturday.

===Museums===
* Beatles Museum – dedicated to The Beatles, as John Lennon&#x27;s first guitar was made in Alkmaar
* Holland Cheese Museum – located in the historic weigh house
* National Beer Museum &quot;De Boom&quot;
* Op ArtMuseum - closed since 2014
* City Museum Alkmaar – for history of the city

Swedo-Finnish Torvalds is the son of the poet Ole Torvalds, and the father of the software engineer Linus Torvalds of Linux kernel fame.

== Education and experience ==
Torvalds was a member of the Communist Party of Finland from 1969 to 1982. He studied economics in Moscow and was the editor of the taistoist magazine &quot;Arbetartidningen Enhet&quot;. Torvalds has later described his communism as &quot;rebellion&quot;. Between 1995 and 2004 Torvalds worked as a foreign correspondent for the Finnish Broadcasting Company in Moscow and Washington.

Torvalds is fluent in Swedish, Finnish, English, German, and Russian. And he also understands Flemish, Danish and Norwegian.

== Political career ==
=== Career in national politics ===
In 2006, Torvalds joined the Swedish People&#x27;s Party, and the following year he was elected to the post of the third vice chairperson. This upset some party voters due to Torvalds&#x27; past. In 2008, he was elected to Helsinki City Council for term 2009–2012.

On 11 June 2017 the Swedish People&#x27;s Party chose Torvalds as the party candidate for the 2018 presidential election. Some of his campaign themes were education, technology and the environment. Torvalds was the only candidate who openly supported Finland&#x27;s NATO membership during his campaign. In the election, Torvalds placed last with 1.5 percent of the votes, while the incumbent president Sauli Niinistö went on to secure his second term.

=== Member of the European Parliament ===
Torvalds was a candidate for European Parliament election in 2009 on the Swedish People&#x27;s Party list. He received 14,044 votes which was insufficient for a seat. However, on 5 July 2012, he was installed in the European Parliament, when Carl Haglund left his seat to join the Katainen Cabinet as Minister of Defence. In the 2014 European Parliament election Torvalds received about 29,000 votes and was elected.

As an MEP his positions have included vice-chair of the Fisheries committee (PECH) and member of the committee for Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). Since 2021, he has been part of the Parliament&#x27;s delegation to the Conference on the Future of Europe. 

Torvalds has served as shadow rapporteur on the circular economy and on the biofuels directive (which became directive 2015/1513) and as rapporteur of the annual report 2018 on the European banking union.

Torvalds opposed the Copyright Directive (2019) since it was first proposed, considering it unbalanced especially because of its article 13 (i.e. 17).

In addition to his committee assignments, Torvalds is part of the MEPs Against Cancer group and the European Parliament Intergroup on Traditional Minorities, National Communities and Languages.

Following the 2019 elections, Torvalds was part of a cross-party working group in charge of drafting the European Parliament&#x27;s five-year work program on economic and fiscal policies as well as trade.

In June 2023, Torvalds was the recipient of the Environment and Climate Action Award at &quot;The Parliament Magazine&quot;&#x27;s annual MEP Awards

==Linux kernel statement==
Nils&#x27; son Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, joked during a LinuxCon keynote on 18 September 2013 that the National Security Agency, the creators of SELinux, wanted a backdoor in the kernel. However, later, Linus&#x27;s father revealed that the NSA had actually asked for the installation of backdoors in Linux.

<text>Amersfoort () is a city and municipality in the province of Utrecht, Netherlands. As of 31 January 2023, the municipality had a population of 160,902, making it the second-largest of the province and fifteenth-largest of the country. Amersfoort is also one of the largest Dutch railway junctions with its three stations—Amersfoort Centraal, Schothorst and Vathorst—due to its location on two of the Netherlands&#x27; main east to west and north to south railway lines. The city was used during the 1928 Summer Olympics as a venue for the modern pentathlon events. Amersfoort marked its 750th anniversary as a city in 2009.

== History ==
Hunter gatherers set up camps in the Amersfoort region in the Mesolithic period. Archaeologists have found traces of these camps, such as the remains of hearths, and sometimes microlithic flint objects, to the north of the city.

=== Antiquity ===
Remains of settlements dating to 1000 BC have been found in the Amersfoort area. The name Amersfoort, after a ford in the Amer River, today called the Eem, first appeared in the 11th century. The city grew around what is now the &quot;Hof&quot;, where the Bishops of Utrecht established a court in order to control the &quot;&quot; area. It was granted city rights in 1259 by the bishop of Utrecht, Henry I van Vianden. A first defensive wall, made of brick, was completed around 1300 but expansion led to the construction of a new wall in 1380, which was completed around 1450. The Koppelpoort, a combined land and water gate, is part of this second wall. The first wall was demolished and houses were built in its place. Today&#x27;s &quot;Muurhuizen&quot; (wallhouses) Street is located where the first wall stood.

The &quot;Onze-Lieve-Vrouwentoren&quot; (Tower of Our Lady) is one of the tallest medieval church towers in the Netherlands at . When it was built, it was the middle point of The Netherlands, it was exactly built in the center and a reference for the Dutch grid system. The nickname of the tower is Lange Jan (&#x27;Long John&#x27;).

The construction of the tower and the church was started in 1444. The church was destroyed by an explosion in 1787, but the tower survived, and the layout of the church still can be discerned today through the use of different types of stone in the pavement of the open space that was created. It is now the reference point of the RD coordinate system, the coordinate grid used by the Dutch topographical service: the RD coordinates are (155.000, 463.000).

The inner city of Amersfoort has been preserved well since the Middle Ages. Apart from the Onze-Lieve-Vrouwetoren, the Koppelpoort, and the &quot;Muurhuizen&quot; (Wall-houses), there is also the Sint-Joriskerk (Saint George&#x27;s church), the canal-system with its bridges, as well as medieval and other old buildings; many are designated as national monuments. In the Middle Ages, Amersfoort was an important centre for the textile industry, and there were a large number of breweries. Jews also lived in Amersfoort in the Middle Ages, before being expelled from the province in 1546 and beginning to return to the city in 1655.

=== Origin of the &quot;Keistad&quot; ===

The nickname for Amersfoort, &quot;Keistad&quot; (boulder-city), originates in the &quot;Amersfoortse Kei&quot;, a boulder that was dragged from the Soest moors into the city in 1661 by 400 people because of a bet between two landowners. The people got their reward when the winner bought everyone beer and pretzels. Other nearby towns then nicknamed the people of Amersfoort &quot;Keientrekker&quot; (boulder-puller). This story embarrassed the inhabitants, and they buried the boulder in the city in 1672, but after it was found again in 1903 it was placed in a prominent spot as a monument. There are not many boulders in the Netherlands, so it can be regarded as an icon.

=== Nieuw Amersfoort ===
One of the six Dutch towns established in the 17th century in what is now Brooklyn was called &quot;Nieuw Amersfoort&quot; (New Amersfoort). The original patentees were Wolfert Gerritse van Kouwenhoven and Andries Hudde. Unlike other Dutch names which were retained up to the present, Nieuw Amersfoort is now called &quot;Flatlands&quot;.

In the 18th century, the city flourished because of the cultivation of tobacco, but from about 1800 onwards began to decline.

The decline was halted by the establishment of the first railway connection in 1863, and some years later, by the building of a substantial number of infantry and cavalry barracks, which were needed to defend the western cities of the Netherlands.

After the 1920s, growth stalled again; in 1970, the national government designated Amersfoort, then numbering some 70,000 inhabitants, as a &quot;growth city&quot;.

=== First World War ===
During the First World War, the area of Amersfoort with nearby Soesterberg and Zeist was one of the places in The Netherlands where many refugees from Belgium were sheltered. The &quot;Belgenmonument&quot;, located in the vicinity of the former refugee camp Elisabethdorp, commemorates this period and the hardships of the Belgian refugees.

=== Second World War ===

Since Amersfoort was the largest garrison town in the Netherlands before the outbreak of the Second World War, with eight barracks, and part of the main line of defence, the whole population of then 43,000 was evacuated at the start of the invasion by the Germans in May 1940. After four days of battle, the population was allowed to return.

There was a functioning Jewish community in the town, at the beginning of the war numbering about 700 people. Half of them were deported and killed, mainly in Auschwitz and Sobibor. In 1943, the synagogue, dating from 1727, was severely damaged on the orders of the then Nazi-controlled city government. It was restored and opened again after the war, and has been served since by a succession of rabbis.

There was a Nazi concentration camp near the city of Amersfoort during the war. The camp, officially called &quot;Polizeiliches Durchgangslager Amersfoort&quot; (Police Transit Camp Amersfoort), better known as &quot;Kamp Amersfoort&quot;, was actually located in the neighbouring municipality of Leusden.

After the war the leader of the camp, Joseph Kotälla, served a life sentence in prison. He died in captivity in 1979. Some of the victims of the camp are buried in Rusthof cemetery near the town.

Among the victims were prisoners of war from the Soviet Union, including 101 Central Asians, mostly Uzbeks. Locals would commemorate them, but the identity of the 101 soldiers was not known, until journalist Remco Reiding started investigating this case in 1999, after hearing about the cemetery. Amongst the few remaining people who witnessed the 101 soldiers is Henk Broekhuizen.

* Kunsthal KAdE: a modern art exhibition hall.

=== Sports ===
Amersfoort had its own professional football (soccer) club named HVC Amersfoort. It was founded on 30 July 1973, but disbanded on 30 June 1982 because of financial problems. The city also hosted the riding part of the modern pentathlon event for the 1928 Summer Olympics. Amersfoort also hosted the Dutch Open (tennis) tournament from 2002 until its end in 2008.

The city is also home to the baseball and softball club Quick Amersfoort. The club&#x27;s top men&#x27;s baseball team plays in the Honkbal Hoofdklasse, the highest level of Dutch baseball.

<text>Wageningen () is a municipality and a historic city in the central Netherlands, in the province of Gelderland. It is famous for Wageningen University, which specialises in life sciences. The municipality had a population of in , of which many thousands are students from over 150 countries.

==Demographics==
=== Inhabitants by nationality ===
71,68% is Dutch, 28,32% has a migration background.

==Geography==
Wageningen is situated on the north bank of the Nederrijn (the Dutch portion of the Lower Rhine) part of the and the Veluwe, of which the southwest hill is called the &quot;Wageningse Berg&quot;. Wageningen can be reached by car from highways A12 via the N781, A15 via the N233 and N225, and A50 via the N225, and from the Ede-Wageningen railway station via a 20-minute bus drive to the Wageningen central terminal (see below).,

&quot;Topographic map of the municipality of Wageningen, July 2013 &quot;

==History==
The oldest known settlements in the Wageningen area were located north of today&#x27;s town centre. They were mentioned as early as 828. During the early Middle Ages a small church was built on the hill east of the town. Several wood farms have been found near the top of the hill. In the twelfth century people settled at what is currently the Bergstraat. Close to Hotel de Wereld a stone floor has been found dating back to this period. After the construction of a dike to protect the city from the acidic water from the moors that then occupied the Gelderse Vallei (the current Hoogstraat), the oldest part of the present city was built to the south. The parts of the city north of the Hoogstraat were built later. Wageningen received city rights in 1263. The city was protected by a city wall and a moat, and in 1526 a castle was built. The castle was dismantled during the 18th century, but the foundations of three of the towers and part of the wall remain visible today.

The people, city, and institutions of Wageningen suffered greatly during World War II. The central part of Wageningen was destroyed by artillery fire soon after the German invasion of the country in May 1940. The town is also famous for its role at the end of the war: Wageningen was the site of the surrender of &quot;Oberbefehlshaber Niederlande&quot; supreme commander &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Johannes Blaskowitz, to I Canadian Corps commander Lieutenant-General Charles Foulkes, on 5 May 1945, officially ending the war in the Netherlands. The generals negotiated the terms of surrender in the Hotel de Wereld, near the center of the city. Now, each year on 5 May, celebrated as Liberation Day in the Netherlands, Wageningen hosts a large festival. On this occasion, veteran soldiers parade through the city and are honoured for their service, and around 120,000 people visit the pop-podia around the city.

== Education and research ==

In 1918 the town acquired its first institution of higher education, the &quot;Landbouwhogeschool Nederland&quot; (Netherlands Agricultural College), which was based on the previous agricultural college founded in 1876, and which later became Wageningen University. This initiated the development from a small historical town into a modern technological community, a process which still continues today.

Wageningen University and Research Centre (WUR), including associated institutes, now employs about 7400 people.

Today, Wageningen is also the central city in Food Valley, the Dutch food &amp; nutrition cluster concentrated around WUR, and comprising many institutes, companies and facilities in the food &amp; nutrition field. Food Valley is regarded as the largest food &amp; nutrition Research &amp; Development cluster in the world. One such firm, Keygene, a plant research company in Wageningen, developed AFLP in the early 1990s and collaborated with Beijing Genomics Institute to sequence the entire genome of &quot;Brassica napus&quot;.

==Sports teams==
The city had its own professional football (soccer) club, FC Wageningen, which won the KNVB Cup twice. The club went bankrupt in 1992 and played its last match in May 1992 against NAC Breda.

The city is also home to the largest Korfball club in the country, KV Wageningen.

== Traffic and transport ==

Wageningen is situated on the N225 provincial road, between Driebergen and Arnhem. The N781 provincial road connects Wageningen to the A12 national highway, to the north of the city. A small ferry (for cars, bikes, and pedestrians) crosses the Nederrijn to the south of the city, at Lexkesveer; from there, drivers can connect to the A15 national highway, via the N836 provincial road.

Several firms provide public bus service in and to Wageningen. From the Wageningen central bus terminal, lines connect to Rhenen, Tiel, Veenendaal, Utrecht, Oosterbeek, and Arnhem, and the Ede-Wageningen railway station. Further connections via bus, including to the Hoge Veluwe National Park and the Kröller-Müller Museum, also may be made at the Ede-Wageningen station. Bus service includes the following:

<doc id="101643" wikidata="Q6903267" url="?curid=101643" title="Roosendaal">
<text>Roosendaal () is both a city and a municipality in the southern Netherlands, in the province of North Brabant.

== Towns/villages of the municipality ==
* Roosendaal (population: 66,760)
* Wouw (4,920)
* Heerle (1,900)
* Nispen (1,440)
* Wouwse Plantage (1,230)
* Moerstraten (660)

==The city of Roosendaal==
Under King Louis Bonaparte of the Kingdom of Holland, Roosendaal received city rights in 1809.

Nispen merged with Roosendaal to form the municipality Roosendaal en Nispen. On 1 January 1997 the municipalities Roosendaal en Nispen and Wouw merged into the municipality now simply known as Roosendaal.

===History===
Roosendaal goes back to the 12th and 13th century. The name Rosendaele was first mentioned in a document of 1268. Roosendaal was always a part of North Brabant. In the Middle Ages, Roosendaal grew as a result of the turf business, but the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648) put an end to the growth as Roosendaal and Wouw were suffering from itinerant combat troops that plundered and ravaged everything they came across. For decades the countryside of Roosendaal was abandoned.

During the German occupation (World War II), the occupiers operated a subcamp of the Herzogenbusch concentration camp for Jews in the city.

===Sports===
The leading football team of Roosendaal is RBC.

===Military===
The Korps Commandotroepen have their headquarters and main garrison, the Engelbrecht van Nassaukazerne, in Roosendaal. 
The Royal Marechaussee used to have a brigade in the city. The first brigade was placed in the city on 16 July 1818 and was disbanded on 1 March 1943. On 2 September 1946 the brigade returned to the city, to be disbanded again on 1 September 1989. The Marechaussee would keep a small office on the railway station, due to the station being one of few to directly lead into Belgium.

== Transport ==
* Railway station: Roosendaal

The city serves as a regional railway hub: the Zwolle-Roosendaal Intercity service starts and ends here, the IC from Amsterdam to Vlissingen (Flushing) stops at the station, as did the international Intercity train from Amsterdam to Brussels until 2018, when that train was rerouted via Breda and the HSL-Zuid. There is still an hourly stop-train service to Antwerp.

== Medical care ==
The Bravis Ziekenhuis Roosendaal is the main general hospital for residents of Roosendaal and surrounding areas. Bravis Ziekenhuis offers specialised medical care provided by a broad team of medical specialists. Special units include: Cardiology, Dermatology, Gynaecology, Oncology, Ophthalmology and Intensive Care.

==Events in Roosendaal==
* Carnaval
* Draai van de Kaai cycling race
* Annual &quot;International ABBA Day&quot; – A weekend-long event, normally each April, operated by ABBA&#x27;s official Fan Club which is based in Roosendaal.

<doc id="101646" wikidata="Q164062" url="?curid=101646" title="Maurice, Prince of Orange">
<text>Maurice of Orange (; 14 November 1567 – 23 April 1625) was &quot;stadtholder&quot; of all the provinces of the Dutch Republic except for Friesland from 1585 at the earliest until his death on 23 April 1625. Before he became Prince of Orange upon the death of his eldest half-brother Philip William on 20 February 1618, he was known as Maurice of Nassau.

Maurice spent his youth in Dillenburg in Nassau, and studied in Heidelberg and Leiden. He succeeded his father William the Silent as stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland in 1585, and became stadtholder of Utrecht, Guelders and Overijssel in 1590, and of Groningen in 1620. As Captain-General and Admiral of the Union, Maurice organized the Dutch rebellion against Spain into a coherent, successful revolt and won fame as a military strategist. Under his leadership and in cooperation with the Land&#x27;s Advocate of Holland Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, the Dutch States Army achieved many victories and drove the Spaniards out of the north and east of the Republic. Maurice set out to revive and revise the classical doctrines of Vegetius and pioneered the new European forms of armament and drill. During the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce, a religious dispute broke out in the Republic, and a conflict erupted between Maurice and Van Oldenbarnevelt, which ended with the latter&#x27;s decapitation. After the Truce, Maurice failed to achieve more military victories. He died without legitimate children in The Hague in 1625 and was succeeded by his younger half-brother Frederick Henry.

Maurice is the namesake of Mauritius.
==Life==

Maurice was the son of William the Silent and Anna of Saxony and was born at the castle of Dillenburg. He was named after his maternal grandfather, the Elector Maurice of Saxony, who was also a noted general.

Maurice never married but was the father of illegitimate children by Margaretha van Mechelen (including Willem of Nassau, Lord of the Lek, and Louis of Nassau, Lord of De Lek and Beverweerd) and Anna van de Kelder. He was raised in Dillenburg by his uncle Johan of Nassau (&quot;Jan the Old&quot;).
Together with his cousin, Willem Lodewijk, he studied in Heidelberg and later in Leiden where he met Simon Stevin. The States of Holland and Zeeland paid for his studies, as their father had run into financial problems after spending his entire fortune in the early stages of the Dutch revolt.
Only 16 when his father was murdered in Delft in 1584, he soon was appointed to his father&#x27;s office of stadtholder (&quot;Stadhouder&quot;). The monarchs of England and France had been requested to accept sovereignty but had refused. This had left Maurice as the only acceptable candidate for the position of Stadtholder. He became stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland in 1585, of Guelders, Overijssel and Utrecht in 1590 and of Groningen and Drenthe in 1620 (following the death of Willem Lodewijk, who had been stadtholder there and in Friesland).

Protestant Maurice was preceded as Prince of Orange (not a Dutch title) by his Roman Catholic eldest half-brother Philip William, Prince of Orange, deceased 1618. However, Philip William was in the custody of Spain, remaining so until 1596, and was thus unable to lead the Dutch independence cause.

Maria of Nassau (1556–1616) was a full sister of Philip William from the first marriage of William I, Prince of Orange, (assassinated 1584), to wealthy and powerful aristocrat Anna van Egmont (1533–1558), and a contender to Maurice over the estate of their father.

He was appointed captain-general of the army in 1587, bypassing the Earl of Leicester, who returned to England on hearing this news.

==Military career==


Maurice organized the rebellion against Spain into a coherent, successful revolt. He reorganized the Dutch States Army together with Willem Lodewijk, studied military history, strategy and tactics, mathematics and astronomy, and proved himself to be among the best strategists of his age. The Eighty Years&#x27; War was a challenge to his style, so he could prove himself a good leader by taking several Spanish outposts. Paying special attention to the siege theories of Simon Stevin, he took valuable key fortresses and towns during a period known as the &quot;Ten Glory Years&quot;: Breda in 1590, Zutphen, Knodsenburg in 1591, Steenwijk and Coevorden in 1592, Geertruidenberg in 1593, and Groningen in 1594. In 1597 he went on a further offensive and took Rheinberg, Meurs, Groenlo, Bredevoort, Enschede, Ootmarsum, and Oldenzaal and closed off the year with the capture of Lingen. These victories rounded out the borders to the Dutch Republic, solidifying the revolt and allowing a national state to develop behind secure borders. They also established Maurice as the foremost general of his time. Many of the great generals of the succeeding generation, including his brother Frederick Henry and many of the commanders of the English Civil War, learned their trade under his command.

His victories in the pitched battles at Turnhout (1597) and at Nieuwpoort (1600) were dependent on his innovation of cooperation between arms, with his cavalry playing a major role. The victories earned him military fame and acknowledgement throughout Europe. Despite these successes, the House of Orange did not attain great respect among European royalty, as the Stadtholdership was not inheritable.

The training of his army was especially important to early modern warfare and the Military Revolution of 1560–1650. Previous generals had made use of drill and exercise in order to instill discipline or to keep the men physically fit, but for Maurice, they &quot;were the fundamental postulates of tactics.&quot; 

This change affected the entire conduct of warfare, since it required the officers to train men in addition to leading them, decreased the size of the basic infantry unit for functional purposes since more specific orders had to be given in battle, and the decrease in herd behavior required more initiative and intelligence from the average soldier. One major contribution was the introduction of volley fire, which enabled soldiers to compensate for the inaccuracy of their weapons by firing in a large group. It was first used in European combat at the battle of Nieuwpoort in 1600.

As part of his efforts to find allies against Spain, Maurice received Moroccan envoys such as Al-Hajari. They discussed the possibility of an alliance between Holland, the Ottoman Empire, Morocco and the Moriscos, against the common enemy Spain. Al-Hajari&#x27;s journey chronicles, authored in 1637, mentions in detail the discussion for a combined offensive against Spain.

Maurice was known in his time and by historians as the first general of his age. His reputation rests not as much on his ability to win and exploit field battles as it does on his expertise as a siege commander, military organizer, and innovator. Of his two great adversaries, Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, and Ambrogio Spinola, he cautiously never allowed himself to be brought to battle with Parma and did not follow up chances to offer Spinola battle with forces in his favour on the Yssel in 1606. He was, however, dealt a defeat by the Spanish general at the battle of Mülheim in October 1605. Based on his preference for sieges and small-scale actions, historian David Trim states that it is difficult to reach a verdict on his ability as a tactician. Jonathan Israel notes that on one of the rare occasions when he did have to fight a major battle in the open – the 1600 Battle of Nieuwpoort – it did end with a Dutch victory, but this outcome was highly risky, and Maurice took care to extricate his army and avoid a second such battle.

Maurice founded a whole new school of military professional practice. These pointed the way to the professional armies of the future by reapplying Roman tactics and innovating in the fields of logistics, training, and economics (e.g. paying troops regularly and on time). Many graduates of service under Maurice, such as his nephew, the Marshal Turenne, or his disciples such as Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, applied the Mauritian reforms to great effect in the remainder of the 17th century.

==Maurice and Oldenbarnevelt==
Maurice started out as the protégé of Landsadvocaat (Land&#x27;s Advocate, i.e. secretary to the nobility of Holland and legal counsel to the States of Holland, but functioning as de facto chief minister of Holland and the States-General) Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, but gradually tensions rose between these two men. Against Maurice&#x27;s advice, and despite his protests, Van Oldenbarnevelt decided to sign the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce with Spain, which lasted from 1609 to 1621. The required funds to maintain the army and navy and the general course of the war were other topics of constant struggle.

With the religious troubles between Gomarists (strict Calvinists) and the Remonstrants (Arminians), the struggle between Van Oldenbarnevelt and Maurice reached a climax. Van Oldenbarnevelt was arrested, tried and decapitated despite numerous requests for mercy. Important municipal regents such as Jacob Dircksz de Graeff and Cornelis Hooft from Amsterdam were temporarily removed from office by Moritz&#x27; powerful supporter Reynier Pauw. From 1618 till his death Maurice now enjoyed uncontested power over the Republic. He expanded the Stadtholder&#x27;s palace at the Binnenhof in the Hague. The Maurice Tower is now part of the building complex of the Senate of the Netherlands. In 1618, he also succeeded his elder half-brother Philip William as Prince of Orange, a title he seems rarely to have used.

Maurice urged his cadet half brother Frederick Henry to marry in order to preserve the dynasty.

==Thirty Years&#x27; and Eighty Years&#x27; War==

Historian Jonathan Israel places upon Maurice part of the responsibility for the outbreak of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in which Germany was devastated and a large part of its population killed. As noted by Israel, German Protestants were not eager for an all-out confrontation with the Catholics. Maurice significantly helped precipitate such a confrontation by persuading his nephew Frederick V, Elector Palatine, to accept the Bohemian Crown, as well as actively encouraging the Bohemians to confront Habsburg rule, providing them 50,000 guilders as well as sending Dutch troops to fight in the doomed Battle of the White Mountain. This ill-considered decision proved disastrous to the Bohemians, who were thereby plunged into prolonged oppression, and to Frederick who lost his ancestral lands. It also worsened the Dutch Republic&#x27;s own strategic position.

In 1621 the war with Spain resumed after a 12-year period of truces. The Spanish, led by Ambrogio Spinola, had notable successes, including the Siege of Breda, the old Nassau family residence, in 1625.

Maurice died on 23 April 1625, with the siege still underway. Justin of Nassau surrendered Breda in June 1625 after a costly eleven-month siege.

==Namesakes==
* The island nation of Mauritius, located in the Indian Ocean, was named after him. The island was named in the prince&#x27;s honour by Wybrant Warwijck in 1598 and Dutch emigrants first settled it in May 1638.
* In 1611, the Dutch variously named what is now known as the Hudson River the Mauritius River or the Mauritz River, in honour of the prince. It was also similarly referred to as the Nassau River.

Maurice, besides being stadtholder of several provinces and Captain-General, both non-hereditary and appointive titles, was the hereditary sovereign of the principality of Orange in what is today Provence in France. He also was the lord of many other estates, which formed his wealth:
* Marquis of Veere and Vlissingen
* Count of Nassau-Dillenburg, Buren, Leerdam, Katzenelnbogen, and Vianden
* Viscount of Antwerp and Besançon
* Baron of Aggeris, Breda, Cranendonck, Lands of Cuijk, Daesburg, Eindhoven, City of Grave, Lek, IJsselstein, Diest, Grimbergen, Herstal, Warneton, , Bentheim-Lingen, Moers, Arlay, and Nozeroy; Lord of Dasburg, Geertruidenberg, Hooge en Lage Zwaluwe, Klundert, Montfort, Naaldwijk, Niervaart, Polanen, Steenbergen, Sint-Maartensdijk, Willemstad, Bütgenbach, Sankt Vith, and Besançon.

During his lifetime he kept using the arms as during his father&#x27;s life-time shown here, and never changed to the simpler arms used by his father and half brothers.

== Descendants ==
Maurice never married but was the father of several illegitimate children:

by Margaretha van Mechelen:
* Willem of Nassau, Lord of the Lek (1601–1627)
* Louis of Nassau, Lord of De Lek and Beverweerd (Lodewijk) (1604–1665)
* Maurice (Maurits) (1604– 5 June 1617)

by Cornelia Jacobsdochter:
* Anna (?– 11 June 1673) married François de Ferrier

by Ursula de Rijck:

<text>Iytwelepenty / Davenport Range, or Davenport Ranges National Park (Iytwellepenty), previously the Davenport Murchison National Park, is a national park in the Northern Territory of Australia about south-east of the territorial capital of Darwin, occupying around s of the Davenport Range. It lies within the Davenport Murchison Ranges bioregion, an area of , with a climate ranging from semiarid to subtropical.

The mountains were caused by a tectonic event hundreds of millions of years ago, but recent images from space have shown that erosion occurred that exposed the ridges and valleys only around 100 million years ago. Amelia Creek crater, an ancient eroded impact crater lies within the Davenport Range in the area.

<text>Djukbinj National Park is a protected area in the Northern Territory of Australia located about east-south-east of the territory capital of Darwin.

The national park was proclaimed on 3 April 1997 over land which has previous protected area status and which was part of the Wulna Land Claim - portion 1386 which was the former Escape Cliffs Historical Reserve, portion 2012 which was the former Cape Hotham Forest Reserve, portion 2017 which was the former Cape Hotham Conservation Reserve, and portions 4498, 4499 and 4707 which were parts of the former Marrakai Conservation Reserve.

After the settlement of the land claim, the Limilngan-Wulna Aboriginal Corporation leased the land back to the former Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory for it to use for &quot;the purposes of a national park&quot; following the signing of a joint management agreement on 7 November 1994.

Part of the land within the former Escape Cliffs Historical Reserve includes the site of the first attempt by the Government of South Australia to create a settlement in the Northern Territory and which was listed on the Northern Territory Heritage Register on 12 January 2000 under the name of Escape Cliffs.

<text>Dulcie Range is a national park in the Northern Territory of Australia, 220 km north-east of Alice Springs and 1235 km southeast of territorial capital of Darwin. The park lies along the south-western edge of Dulcie Range. It was first declared in 1991 and again in July 2012. A draft Plan of Management was published by the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory in May 2001.

==History==
The first recorded European visitor to the area was Charles Winnecke in 1878. In 1916 the chief surveyor of the Northern Territory, T. E. Day surveyed the range and named it Dulcie after one of his daughters. Around 1920 an early pastoral lease was taken out at Old Huckitta station, the remains of which are within the southern boundary of the park. 
There was an established population of traditional aboriginal Akarre Arrernte people, evidenced by numerous rock art sites in the Dulcie Range. A plentiful supply of food resources and water supported the clans.
==Description==
The Range is a sandstone plateau standing from 50 to 150 metres above the surrounding plain in the Georgina Basin. Typical of the plains flora are mulga shrub-lands, mallee eucalypt, open woodland and spinifex. The plateau comprises steep sided cliffs, gorges and scree of the predominant Dulcie Sandstone, with numerous watercourses. Recorded in the park are 105 species of bird, 32 of reptiles, 2 of frogs and 3 of fish.

<text>Elsey is a national park in the Northern Territory of Australia, extending from 2 km to 19 km east of Mataranka and 378 km southeast of Darwin.

Features of the park include Mataranka Falls, and the Mataranka Thermal Pools

The thermal springs are home to a well known colony of the little red fruit-bat, species &quot;Pteropus scapulatus&quot;, an attraction that has also been discouraged from inhabiting the site for the strong odour of their camps. These fruit eating bats roost during the day at the stands of bamboo, often in large numbers, and leave at night to feed on nectar from trees.

<text>Finke Gorge National Park is a protected area in the Northern Territory of Australia located about south of the territory capital of Darwin.
The national park covers an area of , and includes the desert oasis Palm Valley, home to a diverse range of plant species, many of which are rare and unique to the area. There are good opportunities for bushwalking and bushcamping in the national park.

==Heritage==
The national park is noted for its ancient palms and Aboriginal cultural sites. The Central Australian Cabbage Palm is found only in Palm Valley and prolifically here. There are around 3000 full grown palms and thousands of small seedlings sprinkled across the park which can get easily trampled by the visitors. Thus the visitors are required to walk along the marked paths to avoid destroying the seedlings. The Finke River is claimed to be one of the oldest catchments in the world, with areas dating back 350 million years.

The national park and nearby areas hold cultural significance to the Western Arrernte Aboriginal people and there is also evidence of early European settlement.

In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

==Access==
A four-wheel-drive route down the Finke River to Illamurta Springs and Watarrka National Park begins at Finke Gorge. Bush walking is another common activity. Kalaranga lookout is an easy 20 minute climb, with views of the rock amphitheatre encircled by rugged cliffs. The Mpaara Walk introduces the mythology of the Western Arrernte Aboriginal culture. In Palm Valley, the Arankaia Walk and the longer Mpulungkinya Walk meander among slender palms, returning across a scenic plateau.

<text>Garig Gunak Barlu is a national park in the Northern Territory of Australia on the Cobourg Peninsula and some adjoining waters about north-east of the territory capital of Darwin. 

It was established by joining the former Gurig National Park and the Cobourg Marine Park. Its name derives from the local Garig language, and the words &quot;gunak&quot; &#x27;land&#x27; and &quot;barlu&quot; &#x27;deep water&#x27;.

The national park consists of all land of the Cobourg Peninsula, of Burford Island, the Sir George Hope Islands (from west to east Greenhill, Wangoindjung, Warldagawaji, Morse, Wunmiyi), Mogogout Island and Endyalgout Island (117.4 km2) to the south of the peninsula, and of adjacent waters. Croker Island, although close east of the peninsula, is not part of the park.

It is categorized as an IUCN Category II protected area.

All six species of Australian marine turtle live in the area of ocean which is included in the park—green sea turtles, hawksbill sea turtles, flatback sea turtles, leatherback sea turtles, and olive ridley sea turtles. The surrounding ocean is also inhabited by sharks and cetaceans, and saltwater crocodiles live near the coast. On land, over 200 species of bird are found in the park, as are several species of mammal.

<text>Judbarra National Park, formerly Gregory National Park and Judbarra / Gregory National Park, is a national park in the Northern Territory of Australia, south of Darwin.

The park is the second largest national park in the Northern Territory, after Kakadu National Park, with an area of . 

The park was formerly known as Gregory National Park, but on 21 October 2011, it was announced that under a joint management plan with the traditional owners, the park would be dual-named &quot;Judbarra / Gregory National Park&quot; for a period of ten years. Since 2021, its official name is Judbarra National Park.

The park consists of two geographically disjoint sections. The larger section lies to the southwest of the smaller northeastern section.

==Indigenous peoples and culture==
The park includes traditional lands of several Indigenous Australian groups, including Ngarinyman, Karrangpurru, Malngin, Wardaman, Ngaliwurru, Nungali, Bilinara, Gurindji, and Jaminjung, and spans the boundary between two major Australian language families, Pama Nyungan and Non-Pama-Nyungan (Northern).

The rock shelters and caves in Judbarra contain an extensive amount of Aboriginal rock art, variously created by painting, stencilling, drawing, printing, and &quot;pecking and pounding&quot;. The human figure is the most common motif; the park is &quot;one of the most prolific sites in Australia&quot; for composite engraved and painted human figures. The rock art of the Judbarra region is considered to represent a distinct art province.

==Ecology==
Ecologically, the park is in the transition between tropical and semi-arid zones.

The park has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports much of the eastern subspecies of the white-quilled rock-pigeon and small numbers of the endangered Gouldian finch, as well as populations of the chestnut-backed buttonquail, partridge pigeon, yellow-rumped mannikin and several other near-threatened or savanna-biome-restricted species.

A plant that is only known to the park, &quot;Solanum scalarium&quot;, also known as Garrarnawun bush tomato, was collected near Garrarnawun Lookout in 2018 and formally described in 2022.

<doc id="101655" wikidata="Q189657" url="?curid=101655" title="Kakadu National Park">
<text>Kakadu National Park is a protected area in the Northern Territory of Australia, southeast of Darwin. It is a World Heritage Site. Kakadu is also gazetted as a locality, covering the same area as the national park, with 313 people recorded living there in the 2016 Australian census.

Kakadu National Park is located within the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory, covering an area of , extending nearly from north to south and over from east to west. It is roughly the size of Wales or one-third the size of Tasmania, and is the second-largest national park in Australia, after the Munga-Thirri–Simpson Desert National Park. Most of the region is owned by the Aboriginal traditional owners, who have occupied the land for around 60,000 years and, today, manage the park jointly with Parks Australia. It is highly ecologically and biologically diverse, hosting a wide range of habitats and flora and fauna. It also includes a rich heritage of Aboriginal rock art, including highly significant sites, such as Ubirr. Kakadu is fully protected by the EPBC Act.

The Ranger Uranium Mine site, one of the most productive uranium mines in the world until it ceased operations in January 2021, is surrounded by the park.

Domestic Asian water buffalo, which are now an established feral population and invasive environmental pests, were released into the area in the late 19th century. Feral pigs, cats, red foxes and rabbits are further examples of invasive species, all of which compete with and wreak havoc upon the sensitive, unique ecosystems of the Northern Territory, and of the whole of Australia. These species were intentionally brought to the continent by the early settlers, pastoralists, and missionaries. The European presence, albeit less than in more populated regions (on the east and west coasts), was still felt. In Kakadu, missionaries established a mission at Oenpelli (present-day Gunbalanya) in 1925. A few pastoralists, crocodile-hunters and wood cutters also made a living in the area at various times up until the early 20th century. The area was progressively given protected status from the 1970s onward.

==History==

===Aboriginal history===
The name &quot;Kakadu&quot; probably originates from the mispronunciation of Gaagudju, which is the name of an Aboriginal language spoken in the north-western part of the park. Explorer Baldwin Spencer had incorrectly ascribed the name &quot;Kakadu tribe&quot; to the people living in the Alligator Rivers area

Aboriginal peoples have occupied the Kakadu area continuously for around 60,000 years. Kakadu National Park is renowned for the richness of its Aboriginal cultural sites. There are more than 5,000 recorded art sites illustrating Aboriginal culture over thousands of years. The archaeological sites demonstrate Aboriginal occupation for at least 20,000 and possibly up to 40,000 years.

===The arrival of non-Indigenous people===

====Explorers====
The Chinese, Malays and Portuguese all claim to have been the first non-Aboriginal explorers of Australia&#x27;s north coast. The first surviving written account comes from the Dutch. In 1623 Jan Carstenszoon made his way west across the Gulf of Carpentaria to what is believed to be Groote Eylandt. Abel Tasman is the next documented explorer to visit this part of the coast in 1644. He was the first person to record European contact with Aboriginal people. Almost a century later Matthew Flinders surveyed the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1802 and 1803.
Phillip Parker King, an English navigator entered the Gulf of Carpentaria between 1818 and 1822. During this time he named the three Alligator Rivers after the large numbers of crocodiles, which he mistook for alligators.

Ludwig Leichhardt was the first land-based European explorer to visit the Kakadu region, in 1845 on his route from Moreton Bay in Queensland to Port Essington in the Northern Territory. He followed Jim Jim Creek down from the Arnhem Land escarpment, then went down the South Alligator before crossing to the East Alligator and proceeding north.

In 1862, John McDouall Stuart travelled along the south-western boundary of Kakadu but did not see any people.

The first non-Aboriginal people to visit and have sustained contact with Aboriginal people in northern Australia were the Macassans from Sulawesi and other parts of the Indonesian archipelago. They travelled to northern Australia every wet season, probably from the last quarter of the seventeenth century, in sailing boats called &quot;prau&quot;s. Their main aim was to harvest trepang (sea cucumber), turtle shell, pearls and other prized items to trade in their homeland. Aboriginal people were involved in harvesting and processing the trepang, and in collecting and exchanging the other goods.

There is no evidence that the Macassans spent time on the coast of Kakadu but there is evidence of some contact between Macassan culture and Aboriginal people of the Kakadu area. Among the artefacts from archaeological digs in the park are glass and metal fragments that probably came from the Macassans, either directly or through trade with the Cobourg Peninsula people.

The British attempted a number of settlements on the northern Australian coast in the early part of the nineteenth century: Fort Dundas on Melville Island in 1824; Fort Wellington at Raffles Bay in 1829; and Victoria Settlement (Port Essington) on the Cobourg Peninsula in 1838. They were anxious to secure the north of Australia before the French or Dutch, who had colonised islands further north. The British settlements were all subsequently abandoned for a variety of reasons, such as lack of water and fresh food, sickness and isolation.

====Buffalo hunters====

Water buffalo had a large influence on the Kakadu region as well. By the 1880s the number of buffaloes released from early settlements had increased to such an extent that commercial harvesting of hides and horns was economically viable. The industry began on the Adelaide River, close to Darwin, and moved east to the Mary River and Alligator Rivers regions.

Most of the buffalo hunting and skin curing was done in the dry season, between June and September, when buffaloes congregated around the remaining billabongs. During the wet season hunting ceased because the ground was too muddy to pursue buffalo and the harvested hides would rot. The buffalo-hunting industry became an important employer of Aboriginal people during the dry-season months.

====Missionaries====
Missionaries also had a large influence on the Aboriginal people of the Alligator Rivers region, many of whom lived and were schooled at missions in their youth. Two missions were set up in the region in the early part of the century. Kapalga Native Industrial Mission was established near the South Alligator River in 1899, but lasted only four years. The Oenpelli Mission began in 1925, when the Church of England Missionary Society accepted an offer from the Northern Territory Administration to take over the area, which had been operated as a dairy farm. The Oenpelli Mission operated for 50 years.

====Pastoralists====
The pastoral industry made a cautious start in the Top End. Pastoral leases in the Kakadu area were progressively abandoned from 1889, because the Victoria River and the Barkly Tablelands proved to be better pastoral regions.

In southern Kakadu, much of Goodparla and Gimbat was claimed in the mid-1870s by three pastoralists, Roderick, Travers and Sergison. The leases were subsequently passed on to a series of owners, all of whom were unable for one reason or another to make a go of it. In 1987 both stations were acquired by the Commonwealth and incorporated in Kakadu National Park.

A sawmill at Nourlangie Camp was begun by Chinese operators, probably before World War I, to mill stands of cypress pine in the area. After World War II a number of small-scale ventures, including dingo shooting and trapping, brumby shooting, crocodile shooting, tourism and forestry, began.

Nourlangie Camp was again the site of a sawmill in the 1950s, until the local stands of cypress pine were exhausted. In 1958 it was converted into a safari camp for tourists. Soon after, a similar camp was started at Patonga and at Muirella Park. Clients were flown in for recreational buffalo and crocodile hunting and fishing.

Crocodile hunters often made use of the bush skills of Aboriginal people. By imitating a wallaby&#x27;s tail hitting the ground, Aboriginal hunters could attract crocodiles, making it easier to shoot the animals. Using paperbark rafts, they would track the movement of a wounded crocodile and retrieve the carcass for skinning. The skins were then sold to make leather goods. Aboriginal people became less involved in commercial hunting of crocodiles once the technique of spotlight shooting at night developed. Freshwater crocodiles have been protected by law since 1964 and saltwater crocodiles since 1971.

===Mining===
The first mineral discoveries in the Top End were associated with the construction of the Overland Telegraph line between 1870 and 1872, in the Pine Creek – Adelaide River area. A series of short mining booms followed. The construction of the North Australia Railway line (1889–1976) gave more permanency to the mining camps, and places such as Burrundie and Pine Creek became permanent settlements. Small-scale gold mining began at Imarlkba, near Barramundi Creek, and Mundogie Hill in the 1920s and at Moline (previously called Eureka and Northern Hercules mine), south of the park, in the 1930s. The mines employed a few local Aboriginal people.

In 1953, uranium was discovered along the headwaters of the South Alligator River valley. Thirteen small but rich uranium mines operated in the following decade, at their peak in 1957 employing over 150 workers. Early in the 1970s large uranium deposits were discovered at Ranger, Jabiluka and Koongarra. Following receipt of a formal proposal to develop the Ranger site, the Commonwealth Government initiated an inquiry into land use in the Alligator Rivers region. The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry (known as the Fox inquiry) recommended, among other things, that mining begin at the Ranger site, that consideration be given to the future development of the Jabiluka and Koongarra sites, and that a service town be built.

Gold mining was proposed in the late 1980s at Coronation Hill (Guratba). This site had initially been excluded from the park but was added as part of stage 3. Its mining was blocked following environmental and social campaigns. Despite internal disagreement the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, vetoed mining in a Cabinet Meeting in May 1991.

In the mid 1990s a similar debate over additional uranium mining at Jabiluka was prevented by a campaign and blockade initiated by the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation.
The Ranger uranium mine closed in 2021.

==Extent and features==
Kakadu National Park covers an area of , extending nearly from north to south and over from east to west. It is the size of Wales, about one-third the size of Tasmania, and nearly half the size of Switzerland, making it the second largest national park in Australia after the Munga-Thirri–Simpson Desert National Park, which was proclaimed in November 2021.

The park includes four major river systems:
* the East Alligator River
* the West Alligator River
* the Wildman River
* the entire South Alligator River

===Geology and landforms===
Most of Kakadu was under a shallow sea approximately 140 million years ago, with the escarpment wall formed from sea cliffs and Arnhem Land from a flat plateau above the sea. The escarpment rises above the plateau and extends approximately along the eastern edge of the park and on into Arnhem Land. The escarpment varies from near vertical cliffs in the Jim Jim Falls area to isolated outliers and stepped cliffs in the North.

There are six main landforms in Kakadu National Park: the Arnhem Land plateau and escarpment complex, known as the stone country; the outliers; the lowlands; the southern hills and basins; the floodplains; and the tidal flats. Each landform has its own range of habitats. Kakadu&#x27;s varied landscapes and the habitats they contain are features that contributed to its listing as a World Heritage Area.
Chasms and gorges form a network that dissects the rocky platforms on the plateau. The plateau top is a harsh, dry environment where water drains away quickly and topsoil is scarce. Sparse pockets of open forest and woodlands have developed in these areas. Creeks have carved deep gorges in the escarpment in which tall monsoon forests grow. These areas form microclimates for plants and animals and often serve as a refuge during the dry season. &quot;Allosyncarpia ternata&quot;, a large shady tree found only in the Kakadu and Arnhem Land, is the dominant plant species.

The outliers are essentially pieces of the Arnhem Land plateau that have become separated from the plateau complex by erosion. They were islands in the ancient seas that once covered much of Kakadu. The gently undulating lowland plains stretch over much of the Top End. Travelling anywhere in Kakadu, you cannot help noticing the lowlands—they make up nearly 70% of the park. The soils are shallow and often overlie extensive sheets of laterite (ironstone) and a thick profile of strongly leached rocks.
During the wet season water carried down from the Arnhem Land plateau often overflows from creeks and rivers onto nearby floodplains. Alluvial soils carried in the floodwaters add nutrients to the floodplains. Nutrient-rich soils along with an abundance of water and sunlight make the floodplains an area of prolific plant and animal life. During the dry season the water recedes into rivers, creeks, and isolated waterholes or billabongs. Kakadu&#x27;s wetlands are listed under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (the Ramsar Convention) for their outstanding ecological, botanical, zoological, and hydrological features.

The southern hills and basins cover a large area in the south of the park, including the headwaters of the South Alligator River. Rocks here have been exposed from beneath the retreating Arnhem escarpment; they are of volcanic origin and are extremely old (2500 million years). This landform is characterised by rugged strike ridges separated by alluvial flats.

Kakadu&#x27;s coast and the creeks and river systems under tidal influence (extending about 100 kilometres inland) make up this landform. The shape of the estuaries and tidal flats varies considerably from the dry season to the wet season. During the dry season tidal action deposits silt along the river beds and banks. During the wet season the river beds are eroded by the floodwaters and large quantities of fresh and saline water flow out across the tidal flats, where silt is deposited. Large silt loads are also carried out to sea, some of the silt being deposited as a nutrient rich layer on the sea floor, contributing to the muddy waters that characterise Kakadu&#x27;s coastline.
The estuaries and tidal flats are home to an array of plants and animals adapted to living in the oxygen-deficient saline mud. The dominant habitats are mangrove swamps and samphire flats. Where freshwater springs occur along the coasts and river banks, isolated pockets of coastal monsoon rainforests form.

==Protection, ownership and management==
The park was declared as a protected area in several stages starting in the 1970s.

The cultural and natural values of Kakadu National Park were recognised internationally when the Park was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. This is an international register of properties that are recognised as having outstanding cultural or natural values of international significance.

===Fight for Kakadu===

Kakadu was proclaimed a National Park in several stages between 1979 and 1991. These parts also were progressively added to its World Heritage Status as those additions were made. The first was Stage 1 in 1981, then in 1987 (Stages 1 and 2), in 1992 (Stages 1, 2 and 3).

Between 1988-1991 an exclusion zone to allow exploration and mining, particularly of gold, at Coronation Hill and El Sherana by BHP existed. Groups from environmental, social and indigenous perspectives opposed the proposal. Miners and some economists supported it.

In Victoria the Kakadu Action Group (KAG) was formed by Lindsay Mollison at the Melbourne offices of the Australian Conservation Foundation where regular meetings were held. The Group held public meetings to encourage support for opposition to the proposal. Mollison also participated by contributing and rebutting letters to the &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; of The Age newspaper over the several years. The organisation was being surveilled by the Australian Government with archives of its meetings still held secretly by the Government (due for release in 2026).

In a hearts and mind campaign, including KAG&#x27;s contributions, the excluded sections within the proposed stage 3 were progressively decreased in size and were eventually completely removed after the mining proposal was ultimately vetoed at a Cabinet meeting by the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, in May 1991. Those actions were important in his being replaced later that year. The area was added to Kakadu National Park as part of its stage 3 inclusions in 1992. The activities of the Kakadu Action Group during these years contributed to mining being banned and the areas being added to the Park.

However, a separate exclusion zone at Jabiluka still remained. In this instance the proposal was to mine uranium. This was finally ruled out and this part of Kakadu was added to the Park in 1996. The precedents set with Coronation Hill were important in that decision. Local First Nations Gaagudju man Big Bill Neidjie was an important leader in the campaign against the proposed Jabiluka mine and the inclusion of the area in the park.

In 2011 the Koongarra area, where there remained a proposal for another uranium mine, was added to the World Heritage Region.

===Park management===
The Kakadu National Park is proclaimed under the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; (the EPBC Act) and is managed through a joint management arrangement between the Aboriginal traditional owners and the Director of National Parks. The Director manages Commonwealth national parks through Parks Australia. Parks Australia and the Aboriginal traditional owners of Kakadu are committed to the principle of joint management of the park and arrangements to help this happen are highlighted in Kakadu&#x27;s Plan of Management.

The EPBC Act provides for boards of management to be established for parks on Aboriginal land. The Kakadu Board of Management, which has an Aboriginal majority (ten out of fifteen members), representing the Aboriginal traditional owners of land in the park, was established in 1989. The Board determines policy for managing the park and is responsible, along with the Director, for preparing plans of management for the park. The Plan of Management is the main policy document for the park and strives to balance strategic or long-term goals and tactical or day to day goals.
Day-to-day management of Kakadu is carried out by people employed by Parks Australia, which is a branch of the Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Approximately one-third of the staff in Kakadu are Aboriginal people.

Kakadu National Park re-introduced a park use fee from April 2010, to help manage the natural and cultural values of the park environment and improve visitor services.

===Aboriginal land ownership===
Approximately half of the land in Kakadu is Aboriginal land under the &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976&quot;. Most of the remaining land was under native title claim by Aboriginal people for several decades until March 2022, under four different claims. On 24 March 2022 a ceremony took place today to mark the formal handback by Minister for Indigenous Affairs Ken Wyatt of nearly half of the park to Aboriginal traditional owners. These are the Limingan/ Minitja, Murumburr, Karndidjbal, Yulhmanj, Wurngomgu, Bolmo, Wurrkbarbar, Madjba, Uwinymil, Bunidj, Djindibi, Mirrar Kundjeyhmi and Dadjbaku peoples. The areas of the park that are owned by Aboriginal people are leased by the traditional owners to the Director of National Parks to be managed as a national park.

==Climate==
Kakadu is located in the tropics, between 12° and 14° south of the Equator. The climate is monsoonal, characterised by two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The &quot;build up&quot; describes the transition between the dry and the wet. During the dry season (from April/May to September), dry southerly and easterly trade winds predominate. Humidity is relatively low and rain is unusual. At Jabiru, the average maximum temperature for June–July is 32 °C. During the &quot;build up&quot; (October to December) conditions can be extremely uncomfortable with high temperatures and high humidity. However, &quot;build up&quot; storms are impressive and lightning strikes are frequent. In fact, the Top End of Australia records more lightning strikes per year than any other place on earth. At Jabiru the average maximum temperature for October is 37.5 °C.

The wet season (January to March/April) is characterised by warm temperatures and rain. Most of the rain is associated with monsoonal troughs formed over Southeast Asia, although occasionally tropical cyclones produce intense heavy rain over localised areas. At Jabiru, the average maximum temperature for January is 33 °C. Annual rainfall in Kakadu National Park ranges from 1,565 mm in Jabiru to 1,300 mm in the Mary River region.

Most non-Aboriginal people really only refer to the rain and dry seasons, but the Bininj/Mungguy people identify as many as six seasons in the Kakadu region:

* Kunumeleng – mid-October to late December, pre-monsoon storm season with hot weather and building thunderstorms in the afternoons
* Kudjewk – from January to March, monsoon season with thunderstorms, heavy rain, and flooding; the heat and humidity generate an explosion of plant and animal life
* Bangkerreng – April, the &quot;knock &#x27;em down storm&quot; season where floodwater recedes but violent, windy storms knock down grasses
* Yekke – from May to mid-June, relatively cool with low humidity, the Aboriginal people historically started burning the woodlands in patches to &quot;clean the country&quot; and encourage new growth for grazing animals
* Wurrkeng – from mid-June to mid-August, the cold weather season with low humidity; most creeks stop flowing and the floodplains quickly dry out
* Kurrung – from mid-August to mid-October, hot dry weather with ever-shrinking billabongs.

==Flora and fauna==
Kakadu is ecologically and biologically diverse.

===Flora===

Kakadu&#x27;s flora is among the richest in northern Australia with more than 1700 plant species
recorded which is a result of the park&#x27;s geological, landform and habitat diversity. Kakadu is also considered to be one of the most weed free national parks in the world.

The distinctly different geographical areas of Kakadu have their own specialised flora. The environment referred to as the &quot;Stone Country&quot; features &quot;resurrection grasses&quot; that are able to cope with extreme heat and long dry spells followed by periods of torrential rain. Monsoon forests often develop in the cool moist gorges dissecting the stone country. The southern hills and basins support several endemic plants that are only found in Kakadu such as &quot;Eucalyptus koolpinensis&quot; near Jarrangbarnmi (Koolpin Gorge). Lowland areas form a large proportion of Kakadu National Park and are mainly covered in eucalypt-dominated open woodland with the ground layer consisting of a large range of grasses including spear grass, sedges and wildflowers. The Kakadu plum, &quot;Terminalia ferdinandiana&quot;, is commonly found in the area.

The floodplains, which are inundated for several months each year, feature sedges such as spike rush as well patches of freshwater mangroves (itchy tree), pandanus and paper bark trees (Melaleuca). Varieties of water lilies, such as the blue, yellow and white snowflake, are commonly found in these areas. Estuaries and tidal flats are populated with varieties of mangroves (39 of the 47 Northern Territory species of mangrove occur in Kakadu) that are important for stabilising the coastline. Mangroves serve as feeding and breeding grounds for many fish species including the barramundi.

On the tidal flats behind the mangroves, hardy succulents (samphire), grasses and sedges grow. Isolated pockets of monsoon forest grow along the coast and river banks. These forests contain several impressive trees, among them the banyan fig, which can be recognised by its large, spreading aerial roots, and the yellow-flowered kapok bush or cotton tree, &quot;Cochlospermum fraseri&quot;, whose pods split to release cotton-like material.

===Fauna===
There is a remarkable variety and concentration of wildlife, including:
* over 280 bird species
* roughly 60 mammal species
* over 50 freshwater species
* over 10,000 insect species
* over 1,600 plant species
* some 117 species of reptiles

The diverse environments of Kakadu National Park supports a great array of animals, a number of which have adapted to particular habitats. Some animals in the park are rare, endangered, vulnerable or endemic. Responding to the extreme weather conditions experienced in the park, many animals are active only at particular times of the day or night or at particular times of the year.
====Mammals====
About 74 mammal species—marsupials and placental mammals—have been recorded in the park. Most of them inhabit the open forest and woodlands and are nocturnal, making it difficult to see them. Others, such as wallabies and kangaroos (macropods, 8 species), are active in the cooler parts of the day and are easier to see.

Among the larger more common species are dingoes, antilopine kangaroos, black wallaroos, agile wallabies, and short-eared rock wallabies. Smaller common mammals are northern quolls, brush-tailed phascogales, brown bandicoots, black-footed tree-rats, and black flying foxes. Dugongs are found in the coastal waters. However, recent surveys have revealed a disturbing decline of nearly all mammal species throughout Kakadu, including once common and widespread species such as northern tart bats.

====Birds====
Kakadu&#x27;s many habitats support more than 280 species of birds, or about one-third of Australia&#x27;s bird species. Some birds range over a number of habitats, but many are found in only one environment.

Some 11,246 km2 of Kakadu&#x27;s savanna habitats has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of the endangered Gouldian finch, the vulnerable red goshawk, the near threatened partridge pigeon and chestnut-backed button-quail, and the restricted-range hooded parrot and rainbow pitta. The Kakadu Savanna IBA also supports varied lorikeets, northern rosellas, silver-crowned friarbirds, white-gaped, yellow-tinted, white-lined, bar-breasted and banded honeyeaters, sandstone shrike-thrushes, white-browed robins, canary white-eyes, and masked and long-tailed finches.

Waterbirds include large populations of magpie geese, wandering whistling ducks, green pygmy geese, comb-crested jacana, black-necked stork, Australian pelicans, little black cormorant, Australian darter, nankeen night herons, pied herons, black bittern, sarus crane and brolga.

====Reptiles====

Some 117 species of reptiles have been recorded in Kakadu. Being cold-blooded, these animals rely on heat from an external source such as the sun to regulate their body temperature. This is not to say that reptiles are active only during the day; in fact, few snakes can withstand Kakadu&#x27;s midday heat and most are active at night. Since the arrival of the cane toad in the park, many populations of reptiles have crashed. Reptiles which were once a common sight such as large goannas, eastern brown snakes, death adders and many others were rare by 2010. The iconic frill-necked lizard has also significantly dropped in numbers.

Two species of crocodile occur in Kakadu: the freshwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus johnstonii&quot;) and the estuarine, or saltwater crocodile (&quot;C. porosus&quot;). Freshwater crocodiles are easily identified by their narrow snout and a single row of four large boney lumps called &quot;scutes&quot; immediately behind the head. Estuarine crocodiles do not have these scutes and their snout is broader. The maximum size for a freshwater crocodile is 3 metres, whereas a saltwater can exceed 6 metres.

On October 22, 2002, a twenty-four-year-old female German tourist was killed by a saltwater crocodile assault while swimming in Sandy billabong with other foreign backpackers including her sister.

====Frogs====
Kakadu&#x27;s 25 frog species are extremely well adapted to the region&#x27;s climatic extremes. Many remain dormant during rainless times. With the onset of the wet season, when the billabongs and swamps start to fill with water, the night air is filled with the sounds of frogs such as the northern bullfrog and the marbled frog. As the water builds up, frogs and tadpoles have an abundance of food, such as algae, vegetation, insects, dragonfly nymphs, and other tadpoles. Not all of Kakadu&#x27;s frogs are found in the wetlands: many live in the lowland forests.

====Fish====

Fifty-three species of freshwater fish have been recorded in Kakadu&#x27;s waterways; eight of them have a restricted distribution. In the Magela Creek system alone, 32 species have been found. In comparison, the Murray–Darling river system, the most extensive in Australia, now supports only 27 native fish species. Although introduced fish have been found in most Australian waterways, none have been recorded in the park.

====Insects====
Kakadu supports more than 10,000 species of insect. Among the insect groups are grasshoppers, beetles, flies, termites, butterflies and moths, bees, wasps, ants, dragonflies and damselflies, caddisflies, non-biting midges and mayflies. The great variety of insects is a result of the varied habitats and relatively high temperatures throughout the year.

Perhaps the most striking insect-created features in the park are the termite mounds. The mounds in the southern part of the park are particularly large and impressive. Leichhardt&#x27;s grasshopper, in colours of orange-red, blue and black, is perhaps the most spectacular insect found in Kakadu. It is also found on the Arnhem Land plateau and in Gregory National Park.

==Environmental problems and threats==
Kakadu has seen several invasive species that threaten the native habitat, particularly in recent decades. Introduced fauna including the water buffalo, wild pig and more recently, the cane toad have damaged habitat. Invasive weeds include &quot;Mimosa pigra&quot;, which covers of the Top End, including vast areas of Kakadu, invasive para grass (&quot;Urochloa mutica&quot;) displaces the native food of much of Kakadu&#x27;s birdlife. &quot;Salvinia molesta&quot; has infested the Magela floodplain. Brumbies also inhabit areas of the National Park, including Yellow Water. The controversial Ranger Uranium mine, one of the world&#x27;s most productive uranium mines, is surrounded by the park, and presents a significant management challenge both now and into the future, with the question of how to safely contain low-level radioactive wastewater. The escape of contaminated wastewater into the Park&#x27;s wetlands, which may become more likely under climate change–induced rainfall events, would have a devastating impact on the Park&#x27;s biodiversity.

==Aboriginal rock art sites==

The art sites of Ubirr, Burrunguy (Nourlangie Rock) and Nanguluwur are internationally recognised as outstanding examples of Aboriginal rock art. Some of the paintings are up to 20,000 years old, which makes them one of the longest historical records of any group of people on earth. The local Aboriginal word for rock art is &quot;kunbim&quot;. These sites are found in rocky outcrops that have afforded shelter to Aboriginal inhabitants for thousands of years. The painting in these rock shelters were done for various reasons:

* Hunting – animals were often painted to increase their abundance and to ensure a successful hunt by placing people in touch with the spirit of the animal
* Religious significance – at some sites paintings depict aspects of particular ceremonies
* Stories and learning – stories associated with the Creation Ancestors, who gave shape to the world were painted
* Sorcery and magic – paintings could be used to manipulate events and influence people&#x27;s lives
* Fun - for play and practice.

Ubirr is a group of rock outcrops in the northeast of the park, on the edge of the Nadab floodplain. There several large rock overhangs that would have provided excellent shelter to Aboriginal people over thousands of years. Ubirr&#x27;s proximity to the East Alligator River and Nadab floodplains means that food would have been abundant and this is reflected in much of the rock art here. Animals depicted in the main gallery include barramundi, catfish, mullet, goanna, snake-necked turtle, pig-nosed turtle, rock-haunting ringtail possum, and wallaby and thylacine (Tasmanian tiger).

There are also images of the Rainbow Serpent said to have created much of the landscape as well as mischievous Mimi spirits and the story of the Namarrgarn Sisters. Many stories connected to Aboriginal rock are highly complex and linked to other stories. Often the true meanings have been lost, but they all have a purpose which is usually to serve as a lesson or a warning to the young or to those passing through the area.

Burrunguy, formally called Nourlangie Rock, is located in an outlying formation of the Arnhem Land Escarpment. There are a number of shelters in amongst this large outcrop linked by paths and stairways. The shelters contain several impressive paintings that deal with creation ancestors. Some of the stories connected to these artworks are known only to certain Aboriginal people and remain secret.

Anbangbang Billabong lies in the shadow of Nourlangie Rock and is inhabited by a wide range of wildlife which would have sustained traditional Aboriginal people well.

Nanguluwur is a small art site, near Nourlangie, which displays several rock art styles. These include hand stencils, dynamic figures in large head-dresses carrying spears and boomerangs, representations of Namandi spirits and mythical figures, including Alkajko, a female spirit with four arms and horn-like protuberances. There is also an interesting example of &quot;contact art&quot; depicting a two-masted sailing ship with anchor chain and a dinghy trailing behind.

==Human impacts==

Human impacts during the 19th and 20th century have been significant. Introduction of domestic Asian water buffalo from Southeast Asia has resulted in damage to the fragile floodplains and wetlands. Since then, buffalo have largely been eradicated from the area so the land is now rehabilitating itself. Crocodile hunting which has been banned since 1972 made a huge impact on crocodile populations. In the 40 or so years that they have been protected, however the crocodile population has recovered so successfully that some consider there to be an over population.

Mining has an obvious impact on the landscape, but only one operational uranium mine (Ranger) remains. Mine operators are required to completely rehabilitate the area once the operation is wound down. Some small scale logging occurred in the early part of the 20th century, but little evidence of this remains. Tourism represents a significant human impact to Kakadu National Park with hundreds of thousands of visitors arriving annually. Infrastructure such as roads, tracks, interpretive signage and shelter, accommodation, telecommunications and other services must be provided to support this activity.

===Fire management===
Fire is part of the landscape of Kakadu National Park, as the park contains large areas of woodland and grassy plains that are subject to long periods of dry hot weather. The flora of the region has adapted to frequent fires. Fires in northern Australia are less threatening than in southern Australia as many of the trees are largely fire resistant while other plants simply regenerate very quickly.

Controlled burning is practised by the national park in consultation with traditional owners who have used fire as a land management tool for thousands of years. Fire is an important hunting tool for Aboriginal people using it to flush out prey. The other benefit is that once the fire has gone through an area the tender shoots of the fast regenerating grasses attract wallabies into a clearly defined area. Birds of prey such as whistling kites also rely on fire to flush out small animals and are usually found in large numbers circling a fire front. Other species such as white-throated grasswrens have declined because of too many fires. Aboriginal people understand that fire is necessary to &quot;clean up&quot; the landscape and believe that many small fires are preferable to one large fire.

===Tourism===

Kakadu National Park is a major tourist attraction in Australia&#x27;s north. Visitation numbers in 2005 were 202,000. Kakadu&#x27;s dramatic landscape, Aboriginal cultural significance and diverse and abundant wildlife are what visitors are drawn to. There are many beautiful waterfalls and gorges within the park that are popular with visitors, such as Maguk, Gunlom Falls, Twin Falls and Jim Jim Falls.

Kakadu National Park has some of the best examples of Aboriginal rock art in Australia. The sites of Nourlangie and Ubirr are among the most visited locations in the park. It is possible to view some of Kakadu&#x27;s diverse wildlife at places like Yellow Water Billabong, Cooinda on board a wildlife cruise or at Mamukala Wetlands or Anbangbang Billabong. The Kakadu region is one of the world&#x27;s best for bird watching as approximately 30 percent of Australia&#x27;s bird species can be seen here.

Large saltwater crocodiles are also commonplace and visitors are likely to see them at Yellow Water and East Alligator River, so it was no coincidence that the &quot;&quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee&quot; films were shot here. The significance of these creatures to the local aboriginal people, as well as the success of the film, inspired the design of the Gagudju Crocodile Hotel in Jabiru. Visitors are urged to exercise caution around crocodiles as they have been responsible for a number of fatal attacks. Recreational fishing is a popular activity inside Kakadu National Park. The main target species is barramundi, and the most popular locations are Yellow Water, the South Alligator and the East Alligator River. Hunting is not allowed in Kakadu National Park.

There are several accommodation options in the park, mostly found in the town of Jabiru, as well as a range of services to cater to visitors&#x27; needs. Visitors can travel through Kakadu National Park with a recognised tour operator, or they can drive themselves. Many of the park&#x27;s sites are accessible by standard two-wheel-drive vehicles, but areas like Twin and Jim Jim Falls and Gunlom require four-wheel-drive vehicles. Visitors can experience Kakadu National Park via the Nature&#x27;s Way tourism drive, which is a loop from Darwin to Jabiru then onto Katherine and back to Darwin covering approximately 900 km.

==General facilities==
Kakadu National Park is linked to Darwin by the Arnhem Highway and to Pine Creek and Katherine by the Kakadu Highway. Both roads are sealed all weather roads although they may be cut off periodically during periods of heavy rain.

The town of Jabiru has several accommodation options, a service station, police, a medical clinic and a shopping centre with a range of outlets. The town was built for the uranium mine that was established prior to the founding of Kakadu National Park and provides infrastructure for the mine&#x27;s workforce as well as the national park activities and tourism. Jabiru has a small airport from which scenic flights operate daily.

Other small tourism centres such as Cooinda and South Alligator provide limited facilities. Cooinda, south of Jabiru on the Kakadu Highway is the site of Gagudju Lodge Cooinda, Yellow Water Cruises and the Warradjan Cultural Centre. Fuel and limited provisions are available at Cooinda and there is also a small airstrip for scenic flights. South Alligator approximately west of Jabiru on the Arnhem Highway includes a hotel and service station. The Border Store near Ubirr Art Site and Cahills Crossing, north of Jabiru, is a general store.

===Camp sites===

There is a wide variety of designated camping sites throughout the park. Jabiru, Cooinda and South Alligator all have commercial camping areas and are in close proximity to most of the important natural attractions in these areas. Some of the park&#x27;s campsites charge a nominal fee as these have shower and toilet facilities, others are free, however they have limited or no facilities. A list of the sites can be obtained from the Kakadu National Park&#x27;s Glenn Murcutt-designed Bowali Visitor Centre or from their website.

==Governance and demographics==
On 4 April 2007, the land occupied by the national park was gazetted by the Northern Territory Government as a locality with the name Kakadu. The locality is part of the local government area of the West Arnhem Region.

The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Kakadu had 313 people living within its boundaries.

<text>Keep River National Park is in the Northern Territory of Australia, 418 km southwest of Darwin and 468 km west of Katherine. The nearest town is Kununurra in Western Australia.

==Environment==

The park has a number of striking sandstone formations and there is an Indigenous Australian art site at the end of the walk along the floor of the Keep River Gorge. The park falls within the tribal area of the Mirriwung and Gadjerong people. Most of the land in the park also lies within the Keep River Important Bird Area, identified as such because of its importance for the conservation of the endangered Gouldian finch.

==Access==
Like most of the Top End parks, access can be restricted due to flooding in the wet season. The most comfortable period for visiting is between May and August when the temperature ranges from a maximum of 35 °C to a minimum of 10 °C.

<doc id="101657" wikidata="Q1568376" url="?curid=101657" title="Litchfield National Park">
<text>Litchfield National Park, covering approximately 1500 km2, is near the township of Batchelor, 100 km south-west of Darwin, in the Northern Territory of Australia. Each year the park attracts over 260,000 visitors.

Proclaimed a national park in 1986, it is named after Frederick Henry Litchfield, a Territory pioneer, who explored areas of the Northern Territory from Escape Cliffs in Van Diemen Gulf to the Daly River in 1864.

==History==

===Early history===

Aboriginal people have lived throughout the area for thousands of years. It is important to the Kungarakan and Marranunggu peoples for whom their ancestral spirits, still considered actively present in the landscape, played a seminal role in forming the landscape, plants and animals of this area.

===Recent history===
The park was named after Frederick Henry Litchfield, a member of the Finniss Expedition that travelled from South Australia in 1864. This was the first European expedition to visit the Top End of Australia by land and it was their aim to explore as widely as possible and establish a settlement at Escape Cliffs, on the mouth of the Adelaide River. Previous attempts at settlement of Australia&#x27;s northern coast at Fort Dundas, Raffles Bay and Port Essington had already failed.

The surveyor and soldier, Boyle Travers Finniss, was chosen by the South Australian government to be their government Resident in the Northern Territory. His decision to choose an area near Escape Cliffs for settlement was disastrous. The settlers suffered from inadequate food rations and infected mosquito bites. Finniss was disliked by the settlers who had accompanied him and argued with his officials.

The area which is now known as Litchfield National Park was first visited by Europeans in September 1865, when Litchfield led a small group to explore the Daly River. His diary of Monday, 25 September describes his travels:

&quot;Monday, 25 – Three horses look as if they were going to knock up; will give them a day&#x27;s spell here. There are fine plains here, splendidly grassed and watered; small belts of stunted gum, vaquois, fan palm, and honeysuckle. Most of the timber is small, but plenty of it is adapted for station purposes. The country from here to Manton&#x27;s Creek on the Adelaide (River) is as fine a country for stock as I have ever seen, the whole of it being well grassed and well watered at all times of the year.&quot;

The discovery of copper and tin led to the establishment of several small scale subsistence mining operations. Pastoral occupation also began in the 1870s, with loggers and graziers facing the difficult conditions of torrential rain, mosquitoes and sandflies.

In 1888 Mt Tolmer became the site of the first tin mine and produced a continual supply of tin. Bamboo Creek&#x27;s tin mining operation began at Makanbarr, A Mak Mak Marranunggu campsite, in 1906. High-quality tin was often found in the ancient riverbeds and on the surface of the hills. All it needed was to be bagged and sold. Small groups operated this way for the next 30 years. By 1941 miners began following the tin-bearing seams into the hills using picks and shovels, and loading the ore into wagons to be pushed or pulled back to the mines&#x27; entrances.

Charles Stead, Thomas Niciloff and Charles Claydon took out the first real lease and set about turning the mine into a commercial venture, with the assistance of local Mak Mak Marranunggu men and women and some Europeans. However, the mine was closed in 1951 after a large flood filled many of the shafts with water. A relic of the old tin mine at Bamboo Creek stands as a reminder of the difficult conditions endured by the pioneer miners.

In 1924 a small homestead was built by the Sargent family on their leased land in the lowlands near Tolmer Falls where there was reliable water and reasonable grazing for their cattle. Their farm proved successful and in 1928 they built Blyth Homestead as an outstation a little further south, so their cattle could take advantage of the good grazing among the paperbarks in this area. Typical of other structures of that time, the homestead is supported with cypress pine tied together with heavy wire and covered with corrugated iron. The family was able to farm their own vegetable and fruit crops, and held up to 13,500 head of cattle, due to the permanent water nearby. After 40 years, the Sargent family sold the lease to the Townsend family who farmed until the early 1960s. The abandoned homestead stands as a stark reminder of the tough conditions graziers faced.

Logging of paperbark, cypress and Leichhardt pines began in 1948 in the north-western section of the park. Again, Aboriginal people assisted and ex-army equipment was utilized to take the timber to the mill where it was prepared for local builders.

Uranium was discovered outside what is now Litchfield&#x27;s eastern boundary in August 1949, by a local prospector, Jack White. Australia&#x27;s first fully operational uranium mine was opened at Rum Jungle, and underground mining occurred from 1950 to 1953. The name Rum Jungle is derived from an accident that occurred in 1871. A bullock-wagon load of rum, destined for the construction gangs, was said to have been bogged near a patch of jungle on the crocodile-inhabited East Finniss River - the bullockies untethered the oxen and set about drinking the rum, having one of history&#x27;s most glorious binges. Production from the open cut area started in 1953 and proved to be one of the largest economic influences in the development of the Top End, with sales to the United Kingdom for their atomic weapons program. The mine closed in 1971.

The park was originally part of Stapleton Station, Tipperary Station and Camp Creek Station pastoral leases. The pastoral activity persisted until the declaration of the area as a national park when in 1985, the lessees of Stapleton Station negotiated the surrender of the pastoral lease and it was subsequently taken up by the Conservation Land Corporation.

==Flora==
The Central sandstone plateau supports rich woodland flora communities dominated by species including Darwin woolybutt and Darwin stringybark, as well as banksias, grevilleas, terminalias and a wide variety of other woodland species.

Remnant pockets of monsoon rainforest thrive along the bottom of the escarpment, and in the deep narrow gorges created over thousands of years by the force of the waterfalls cutting into the escarpment walls.

They are significant because of their size and lack of disturbance. Here visitors will find lilies and slender ground orchids growing among &quot;Pandanus&quot;, paperbark and swamp bloodwoods.

=== Gamba Grass ===
The invasive species &quot;Andropogon gayanus,&quot; better known as gamba grass is a significant threat to the park’s biodiversity due to the frequent, high intensity, late dry season wildfires it exacerbates. The grass was introduced into the Northern Territory of Australia in 1931 for trial as cattle feed. There are now large swathes of the plant over 532,900 hectares between Darwin and Katherine. Gamba grass already accounts for as much as 20% of Litchfield National Park, around 30,000 hectares of the 144,000-hectare park, contributing to worsening fire seasons. Researchers estimate that this will increase to as much as 30% by 2033, a major threat to the park&#x27;s future due to the extreme fire risk, the severity of which can destroy locals species. Total eradication is no longer considered viable due to substantial spread since 2014.

==Fauna==
Common wildlife species include the antilopine kangaroo, agile wallaby, sugar glider, northern brushtail possum, fawn antechinus, black and little red flying foxes and the dingo. The caves near Tolmer Falls are home to a colony of the rare orange leaf-nosed bat and the ghost bat.

Litchfield is a habitat for hundreds of native bird species. Black kites, and other birds of prey are common during the dry season. The yellow oriole, figbird, Pacific koel, spangled drongo, dollarbird and the rainbow bee-eater inhabit the sheltered areas close to waterfalls.
A species of marsupial mouse (the northern dibbler), the rufous-tailed bush-hen, a frog (the pealing chirper) and the primitive archerfish, occur in the Wangi Falls area.

Wangi, Tolmer and Florence falls and Buley Rockhole, are popular with visitors and tour groups. The falls have large pools that attract birds and reptiles such as monitors. orange-footed scrubfowl, honeyeaters, figbirds and Torres Strait pigeons share the fruit and berries in the areas with nocturnal mammals like the northern quoll, northern brown bandicoot and northern brushtail possum. Frill-necked lizard are common throughout the park, but will not be seen as frequently during the cool dry season months. The Finniss River area also hosts a number of large saltwater crocodiles, commonly abbreviated as &quot;salties&quot;.

The magnetic termite mounds are a popular tourist attraction. These wedge-shaped mounds are aligned in a north–south direction as a response to the environment. The termites which build them feed on grass roots and other plant debris found in plains which are seasonally flooded. Therefore, the termites are forced to remain above the water, in the mound. The alignment of the mound acts as a temperature regulator, and allows the temperature to remain stable.

==Sites designated for preservation==

===Bamboo Creek Tin Mine===
Bamboo Creek tin mine is an example of small scale, labour-intensive mine operated without the benefit of heavy earth machinery. It was typical of many of the mines in the Northern Territory which operated in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, especially those operated by the Chinese. The remains include the mine workings; the tin processing mill; and the associated domestic and industrial remains. Tin was discovered at Bamboo Creek in 1906 and was mined irregularly until 1955. The wide variety of remains are notable in that they reflect the complete range of activities associated with underground mining. Artefacts relating to ore extraction, processing and transport are present as well as domestic remains and remnants of the explosives magazine.

===Blyth Homestead===
Blyth Homestead is of heritage significance to the Northern Territory due to its architectural and social significance. The remains consist of the homestead building itself which is a single room, cypress pine and corrugated iron structure encircled by verandahs; a flagstone floor; a scatter of corrugated iron, sandstone blocks and other metal objects; and a set of stockyards constructed using bush timber poles and barbed wire

The homestead was established in 1928 to function as an outstation on Stapleton Station, then owned by Harry Sargent and his family. It was constructed using bush timber (cypress pine) and iron in the form of a large central room that could be closed up with verandahs around the edges. Blyth Homestead is one of the few existing examples of this type of building which was formerly common on NT pastoral leases. The Homestead site contains tangible and well-preserved remnants of both pastoral and mining activities.

The isolated location necessitated the occupants to be virtually self-sufficient with a fruit and vegetable garden, milking cows and meat. A sawmilling plant was used to cut timber needed. Their income was supplemented by alluvial and reef tin mining to the east of the homestead, the products of which had to be carted by buckboard along a self-made track over the Finiss River.

As described by Max Sargent, the tenth of fourteen children of the Sargent family:
&quot;We were possibly the best fed people in Australia right through the depression, with butter, cream and milk, cheese, dried fruits and fresh fruits, fresh vegetables the year round, more than what we could use, but no money!&quot;

The simple bush architecture of the homestead and the opportunistic nature of the mine workings illustrate the harsh conditions under which the Sargent family lived.

===Greenant Creek===
The area of Greenant Creek below the Tjaetaba Falls is a registered Aboriginal sacred site. Swimming or entering the water is not allowed. Visitors are requested to observe all signage.

===Aboriginal sacred sites===
There are several sacred and special sites within Litchfield National Park.

==Tourism==
Every year over quarter of a million of visitors come to the park. Closer to Darwin than the Kakadu National Park, Litchfield National Park is less than two hours drive from the city via a sealed road that connects the township of Batchelor to the Cox Peninsula Road.

In 2021 a tourist from New South Wales appeared to have gone missing for two days after last being seen near the Wangi Falls campground, before being found alive and well.

==Attractions==

Most of the major attractions in the park are linked by sealed road and are easily accessed by two-wheel drive car. However, some of the more remote attractions require a four-wheel drive to access them.
Details of some of the major attractions follow:

===Florence Falls===
Florence Falls is a double-plunge waterfall leading to a popular swimming hole.

===Buley Rockhole===

Visitors to Buley Rockhole will find a long series of cascading plunge pools.

===Wangi Falls===
Possibly Litchfield&#x27;s most popular attraction, Wangi Falls is easily accessible and open all year round. However, swimming is not always possible due to water levels from heavy rain.

=== Tolmer Falls ===

Tolmer Falls cascades over two high escarpments into a deep plunge pool. The bottom of the falls is home to several colonies of rare ghost bats and orange horseshoe bats.

=== Tjaetaba Falls ===
Tjaetaba Falls is a drop along Greenant Creek, one of the smaller systems in the park. These falls and the area below them is an Aboriginal sacred site, and visitors are requested to swim only above the falls.

===Tjaynera Falls (Sandy Creek)===
After a moderate level, 3.5 km return walk through an open valley, visitors can enjoy the usually un-crowded plunge pool beneath Tjaynera Falls.

===Surprise Creek Falls===
These falls are open for swimming.

===Blyth Homestead===
This homestead, build in 1929, stands as a reminder of the tough conditions faced by the pioneers in remote areas.

===Bamboo Creek===
Interpretive signs explain the methods used to extract the tin and to help appreciate the hardship endured by miners as they struggled to make a living in intolerable conditions.

=== Magnetic termite mounds===

These termite mounds are built by thousands of termites with a north–south orientation to control the temperature inside the mounds.

==Bushwalks==
Litchfield National Park offers a wide range of walking tracks. It is strongly recommended that overnight walks are registered with the Overnight Walker Registration Scheme on telephone 1300 650 730. Walkers must camp in designated campgrounds.

===Tabletop Track===
The Tabletop Track, within Litchfield National Park, is a 39 kilometre bushwalk along trickling creeklines, cascading waterfalls, crystal clear pools and undisturbed pockets of tropical monsoon rainforest. Along this track, hikers will spot some of the local wildlife such as wallabies, possums, and flying foxes.

===Florence Creek Walk===
Forming part of the Tabletop Track in Litchfield National Park, this 22 kilometre walk will take you to Greenant Creek, through pockets of cool monsoon rainforest inhabited by a variety of birdlife. Spot kingfishers, honey-eaters, fairy-wrens and pigeons. Other wildlife may be seen along the way such as brown bandicoots and northern quolls. This walk is graded as difficult, and takes about two days.

===Greenant Creek===
This eight and a half kilometre walk, which forms part of the Tabletop Track in Litchfield National Park, takes you from Greenant Creek through to Wangi Falls. The creeks and springs around this region have a constant supply of water, thereby creating an abundance of flora and fauna. There are Carpentaria palms, fig trees and weeping paperbark trees, and, along the forest floor, spot geckos, lizards and frogs.

===Wangi Falls Walk===

This two-day walk, part of the Tabletop Track, runs from Wangi Falls through to Walker Creek. This landscape with its rocky outcrops and ridges provides a haven for the local wildlife such as northern quolls, wallabies, frogs and lizards. There is abundant birdlife too – try spotting colourful red-winged parrots, double-barred finches, or kingfishers.

===Walker Creek Walk===
This final trek of the Tabletop Track in Litchfield National Park, will take you from Walker Creek to Florence Falls. Spot local wildlife including wallabies and possums, or listen to some of the curious bird calls from the variety of birdlife that also inhabit this forest area.

===The Lost City===
These freestanding sandstone blocks and pillar formations bring to mind the ruins of a long-forgotten civilisation. This is considered one of the best short walks in Litchfield National Park. Accessible by four-wheel drive only.

==Accommodation==
There are several camping locations throughout Litchfield. Camping fees apply. Camping is permitted at:

* Wangi Falls
* Buley Rockhole
* Florence Falls
* Tjaynera Falls (Sandy Creek)

==Administrative status==
On 4 April 2007, the land occupied by the national park was gazetted by the Northern Territory Government as a locality with the name, Litchfield Park. The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Litchfield Park had 44 people living within its boundaries. The locality has not been added to any existing local government area and is considered to be part of the Northern Territory&#x27;s unincorporated areas.

<doc id="101658" wikidata="Q1993949" url="?curid=101658" title="Nitmiluk National Park">
<text>Nitmiluk National Park is in the Northern Territory of Australia, 244 km southeast of Darwin, and 23 km northeast of the town of Katherine, around a series of gorges on the Katherine River and Edith Falls. Previously named Katherine Gorge National Park, its northern edge borders Kakadu National Park. The gorges and the surrounding landscape have great ceremonial significance to the local Jawoyn people, who are custodians of Nitmiluk National Park. In the Jawoyn language, &quot;Nitmiluk&quot; means &quot;place of the cicada dreaming&quot;.

==Nitmiluk (Katherine) Gorge==
Nitmiluk Gorge, a deep gorge carved through ancient sandstone by the Katherine River, is the central attraction of the park. Nitmiluk Gorge is made up of thirteen gorges, with rapids and falls, and follow the Katherine River, which begins in Kakadu. During the Dry, roughly from April to October, the Nitmiluk Gorge waters are placid in most spots and ideal for swimming and canoeing. There may be freshwater crocodiles in most parts of the river, as they nest along the banks, but they are harmless to humans. Saltwater crocodiles regularly enter the river during the wet season, when the water levels are very high, and are subsequently removed and returned to the lower levels at the onset of the dry season. Thus, swimming in the wet season is prohibited. Cruises of various lengths go as far as the fifth gorge.

The gorge hosted the final challenge and the finish line of &quot;The Amazing Race Australia 4&quot;.

==Facilities==
The gorges can be explored by canoe and flat bottomed boat. In the dry season the gorges become separated as the level of the river falls. They are interconnected in the wet. There is a visitor centre located at the Katherine Gorge, about 30 km east of the town of Katherine. Information displays are set up that explain the geology, landscape and aboriginal history of the national park. Tours can be booked at the centre or at the visitor centre in the town.

There are two permanent campgrounds where there are both tent and caravan sites. Both fires and bush camping are permitted. There are numerous walking tracks in the national park.

===Jatbula Trail===

The Jatbula Trail follows the route travelled by generations of Jawoyn people between Katherine Gorge and Leliyn. It is named for Peter Jatbula, a man who was instrumental in securing land rights for his people and who walked this route with his family. Members of Peter Jatbula&#x27;s family still live in the area today and continue to help look after country.

== Wildlife ==
Freshwater crocodiles are widely distributed along the river year-round. During the wet season, rises in water levels may allow saltwater crocodiles to enter the gorge, where they are caught and relocated to lower levels when the dry season begins. Birds that can be seen include ospreys, red-tailed black cockatoos, great bowerbirds, white-gaped honeyeaters and red-winged parrots. Part of the Yinberrie Hills Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for endangered Gouldian finches, lies in the park.

<doc id="101659" wikidata="Q251999" url="?curid=101659" title="Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park">
<text>Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park is a protected area in the Northern Territory of Australia. The park is home to both Uluru and Kata Tjuta. It is located south of Darwin by road and south-west of Alice Springs along the Stuart and Lasseter Highways. The park covers and includes the features it is named after: Uluru and, to its west, Kata Tjuta. The location is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for natural and cultural landscape.

==Overview==
Uluru / Ayers Rock is considered one of Australia&#x27;s most recognisable landmarks, and has become a focal point for Australia and the world&#x27;s acknowledgement of Australian indigenous culture. The sandstone monolith stands high with most of its bulk below the ground. To Anangu, the local indigenous people, Uluru / Ayers Rock is a place name and this &quot;Rock&quot; has a number of different landmarks where many ancestral beings have interacted with the landscape and/or each other, some even believed to still reside here. Kata Tjuta / Mount Olga, meaning &#x27;many heads&#x27; in his aboriginal name, is a sacred place relating to knowledge that is considered very powerful and dangerous, only suitable for initiated men. It is made up of a group of 36 conglomerate rock domes that date back 500 million years.

Anangu are the traditional Aboriginal owners of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. They believe that their culture was created at the beginning of time by ancestral beings. Uluru / Ayers Rock and Kata Tjuta / Mount Olga provide physical evidence of feats performed during the creation period. They often lead walking tours to inform visitors about the local flora and fauna, bush foods and the Aboriginal Dreamtime stories of the area.

The &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act&quot; was passed in 1976, meaning that after many years Aboriginal law and land rights were finally recognised in Australian law. Nine years later on 26 October 1985 the traditional owners were presented with the freehold title deeds for the park, who, in turn, leased the land back to the Australian Government through the Director of National Parks (formerly the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service) for 99 years.

The Director is assisted by Parks Australia, a division of the Australian Department of the Environment and Energy. Since hand-back, Anangu and Parks Australia staff have worked together to manage the park. This process of working together is known as &#x27;joint management&#x27;.

==History==
Uluru and Kata Tjuta were formed about 350 million years ago during the Alice Springs Orogeny.

The Anangu have connected to the area for thousands of years and some records suggested that they may have lived there for more than 10,000 years.

Europeans came to the western desert area of Australia in the 1870s. Uluru and Kata Tjuta were first mapped by Europeans during the expeditionary period made possible by the construction of the Overland Telegraph Line in 1872.

In separate expeditions, William Ernest Powell Giles and William Christie Gosse were the first European explorers to this area. In 1872 while exploring the area, Ernest Giles sighted Kata Tjuta from near Kings Canyon and called it Mount Olga, while the following year Gosse saw Uluru and named it Ayers Rock after Sir Henry Ayers, the Chief Secretary of South Australia. Further explorations followed with the aim of establishing the possibilities of the area for pastoralism.

In the late 19th century, pastoralists attempted to re-establish themselves in areas adjoining the South-Western/Petermann Reserve and interaction between Anangu and white people became more frequent and more violent. Due to the effects of grazing and droughts, bush food stores were depleted. Competition for these resources created conflict between pastoralists and Anangu. As a result, police patrols became more frequent. 

Between 1918 and 1921 large adjoining areas of South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were declared as Aboriginal reserves, as sanctuaries for a nomadic people who had virtually no contact with white people. In 1920, part of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park was declared an Aboriginal Reserve (commonly known as the South-Western or Petermann Reserve) by the Australian Government under the &quot;Aboriginals Ordinance 1918&quot;.

During the Depression in the 1930s, the Anangu became involved in dingo scalping with &quot;doggers&quot; who introduced Anangu to European foods and ways. The first tourists visited the Uluru area in 1936.

The Ayers Rock National Park was recognised in 1950, and in the same year an Alice Springs resident Len Tuit accompanied a group of schoolboys on a trip to Uluru. He recognised the enormous tourism potential of the rock and began offering regular tours in 1955, with guests camping in tents and drinking water carted in from Curtin Springs. Kata Tjuta was added to the national park to create the Ayers Rock-Mount Olga National Park in 1958. The first permanent accommodation was constructed the same year, while a new airstrip allowed the first fly-in, fly-out tour groups.

In 1958, in response to pressures to support tourism enterprises, the area that is now the park was excised from the Petermann Aboriginal Reserve to be managed by the Northern Territory Reserves Board as the Ayers Rock – Mt Olga National Park. The first ranger was the legendary central Australian figure, Bill Harney

The site came to attention on 17 August 1980 when two-month-old Azaria Chamberlain was found dead as a result of being taken by a dingo.

On 1 October 2015, traditional owners declared more than of Aboriginal freehold land surrounding the National Park an Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) named Katiti Petermann Indigenous Protected Area. As the fourth largest IPA on mainland Australia, it is larger than Switzerland, and completes a huge network of nine IPAs in Central Australia.

==Geography==

===Geology===
These domed rock formations are composed of conglomerate, a sedimentary rock consisting of cobbles and boulders of varying rock types including granite and basalt, cemented by a matrix of sandstone. The crevasses are due to erosion, primarily by water. Although it is a dry region, the large area of these domes collects a lot of rainwater, which runs off in steep waterfalls during rain.

From a geological point of view, analysis of Uluru-Kata Tjuta and Watarrka National Parks reveals an awe-inspiring history. 500 million years ago, the entire area was covered by an inland sea and over many centuries, sand and mud fell to the bottom of the sea, creating rock and sandstone. Kata Tjuta&#x27;s domes are the eroded remains of sedimentary rock from the seabed, while Uluru is a relict of the coarse grained, mineral-rich sandstone called arkose.

===Climate and seasons===
The park receives an average rainfall of 307.7 millimetres per year. Temperature extremes in the park have been
recorded at during the summer and during winter nights. UV readings on
most extreme summer days reach between 11 and 15. While the Central Australian environment may at first seem stark – a barren landscape supporting spectacular rock formations – closer inspection reveals it as a complex ecosystem, full of life.

Plant and animal life have adapted to the area&#x27;s extreme conditions and it subsequently supports some of the most unusual flora and fauna on the planet. Many of these have long been a valuable source of bush tucker and medicine for local Aboriginal people.
The Aboriginal Australians recognise six seasons:
# Piryakatu (August/September) – Animals breed and food plants flower
# Wiyaringkupai (October/November) – The really hot season when food becomes scarce
# Itanju- (January/February) Sporadic storms can roll in suddenly
# Wanitjunkupai (March) – Cooler weather
# Tjuntalpa (April/May) – Clouds roll in from the south
# Wari (June/July) – Cold season bringing morning frosts

===Ecology===

The park is ranked as one of the most significant arid land ecosystems in the world. As a Biosphere Reserve under the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program, it joins at least 11 other reserves in Australia and an international network aiming to preserve the world&#x27;s major ecosystem types.

==Biology==

===Flora===

Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park flora represents a large portion of plants found in Central Australia. A number of these species are considered rare and restricted in the park or the immediate region. There are many rare and endemic plants at Uluru and Kata Tjuta. A number of other species, while found elsewhere in central Australia, may be endangered within the park.

The desert flora has adapted to the harsh conditions. The growth and reproduction of plant communities rely on irregular rainfall. Some plants are able to survive fire and some are dependent on it to reproduce. Plants are an important part of Tjukurpa, and there are ceremonies for each of the major plant foods. Many plants are associated with ancestral beings. Collection of plant foods remains a culturally important activity, reinforcing traditional links with country and Tjukurpa.

Flora in Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park can be broken into the following categories:
* Punu – trees
* Puti – shrubs
* – flowers
* Ukiri – grasses
Trees such as the mulga and centralian bloodwood are used to make tools such as spearheads, boomerangs and bowls. The red sap of the bloodwood is used as a disinfectant and an inhalant for coughs and colds.

Others such as the river red gum and corkwood trees like grevillea and hakeas are a source of food themselves. The white flaky crust from river red gum leaves can be rolled into balls and eaten like a lolly and the nectar from the flowers of the corkwood trees can produce a sweet drink.

The witchetty bush looks like a shrubby mulga with broad round-ended leaves. Witchetty grubs are found in the roots of this tree.
Daisies and other ground flowers bloom after rain and during the winter. Others such as the wattles bloom as spring approaches. Anangu collect wattle seed, crush and mix it with water to make an edible paste which they eat raw. To make damper, the seeds are parched with hot sand so their skins can be removed before they are ground for flour.

The prickly hard spinifex hummocks have enormous root systems that prevent desert sands shifting. The hummock roots spread underground beyond the prickly clump and deeply into the soil, forming an immense cone. Anangu use a resin gathered from the gummy spinifex to make gum. They thresh the spinifex until the resin particles fall free. These particles are heated until they fuse together to form a moldable black tar which Anangu work while warm. The gum is used for hunting and working implements, and to mend breaks in stone and wooden implements.

The naked woolybutt and native millet have seeds that are important Anangu foods. Women rub the seedheads from their stalks and then separate the seeds from the chaff by skilful winnowing. Using grinding stones, they then grind the seeds to flour for damper.

There are several rare and endangered species in the park. Most of them like adder&#x27;s tongue ferns (Ophioglossaceae sp.) are restricted to the moist areas at the base of the monoliths, which are areas of high visitor use and subject to erosion.

Since the first Europeans arrived, 34 exotic plant species have been recorded in the park, representing about 6.4% of the total park flora. Some such as perennial buffel grass (&quot;Cenchrus ciliaris&quot;) were introduced to rehabilitate areas damaged by erosion. It is the most threatening weed in the park and has spread to invade water and nutrient rich drainage lines. Where infestation is dense, it prevents the growth of native grasses – a source of food for animals and humans. A few others such as burrgrass were brought in accidentally, carried on cars and people.

===Fauna===

Historically 46 species of native mammal are known to have been living in the Uluru region; there are currently 21 according to recent surveys. Anangu allege that a decrease in the number has implications for the condition and health of the landscape. Moves are supported for the reintroduction of locally extinct animals such as mallee fowl, brushtail possum, rufous hare wallaby or &quot;mala&quot;, bilby, burrowing bettong and the black-footed rock wallaby

The mulgara, the only mammal listed as vulnerable, is mostly restricted to the transitional sandplain area, a narrow band of country that stretches from the vicinity of Uluru, to the northern boundary of the park, and into Ayers Rock Resort. This very important area also contains the marsupial mole, woma python, or kuniya, and great desert skink.


The bat population of the park comprises at least seven species that depend on day roosting sites within caves and crevices of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Most of the bats forage for aerial prey within an airspace extending only 100 m or so from the rock face.

The park has a very rich reptile fauna of high conservation significance, with 73 species having been reliably recorded. Four species of frog are abundant at the base of Uluru and Kata Tjuta following summer rains. The great desert skink is listed as vulnerable.

Anangu continue to hunt and gather animal species in remote areas of the park and on Anangu land elsewhere. Hunting is largely confined to the red kangaroo, Australian bustard, emu and lizard such as the sand goanna and perentie.

The pressures exerted by introduced predators and herbivores on the original mammalian fauna of Central Australia were a major factor in the extinction of about 40% of the native species.

Of the 27 mammal species found in the park, six are introduced: the house mouse; camel; fox; cat; dog; and rabbit. These species are distributed throughout the park but their densities are greatest in the rich water run-off areas of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Large numbers of rabbits led to the introduction of a rabbit control program in 1989. This has resulted in a great reduction of the rabbit population, a noticeable vegetation recovery and a reduction in predator numbers. Camels have been implicated in the reduction of plant species, particularly the more succulent species such as the quandong. The house mouse is a successful invader of disturbed environments and habitats that have lost native rodents. Subjective estimates of cat and fox numbers have been collected in association with the rabbit control program. The national threat abatement programs may provide the framework for controlling them. Anangu knowledge and tracking skills are invaluable in the management of these introduced animals. The park regulations prohibit visitors bringing animals into the park unless they are a guide dog for the blind or deaf, or a permit is granted by the Director of National Parks.

Iconic birds of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park include the pied butcherbird, black breasted buzzard, black-faced woodswallow and crimson chat.

===Fire management===
Fires have been a part of central desert land management for thousands of years and have shaped the landscape, habitats, survival of animals and patterns of vegetation. Controlled burning usually takes place during the winter months due to the cooler weather while natural fires mostly occur in the early summer months. They are usually started by the lightning strikes of dry electrical storms from the north west. When the storms arrive the weather is usually hot, dry and windy – conditions ideal for raging fires. Damage can be severe and widespread. Destructive bushfires burnt much of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park and luxury accommodation at the Ayers Rock Resort was destroyed in 2002–03.

Traditional burning of the Uluru area stopped when Anangu were driven from the region during the 1930s. During the 1940s rainfall was good and vegetation flourished. The 1950 fire, fed by the fuel grown during the previous 20 years, wiped out about one third of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park&#x27;s vegetation. The pattern repeated itself and in 1976 two fires burnt 76% of the park. Over the same period more species of medium-sized mammals became extinct around Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Today most fires in the park are lit following land management patterns traditionally practiced by Anangu. Traditional fire and land management skills enable Anangu to burn in a way that will give the desired result. These skills are vital for the preservation of the central Australian ecology.

==Activities==

===General facilities===

The park is open year-round from sunrise to sunset. These times will vary depending on the season. Occasionally parts of the park may be temporarily closed for cultural reasons.

The park entrance fee for Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park is $25 per person 16 years of age and over. This fee is valid for 3 consecutive days and helps to maintain the park. One quarter goes back to Anangu, the
traditional owners, to help them maintain their families and the Mutitjulu community.

The Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Cultural Centre by recognised Australian architect Gregory Burgess located inside the park on the main road to Uluru provides an introduction to Tjukurpa (law, knowledge, religion, philosophy), Anangu art, Anangu way of life (traditional and current), history, languages, wildlife and joint management of the park. There are also art and craft demonstrations, bush tucker sessions, plants walks and cultural presentations.

There are displays featuring photo collages, oral history sound panels, Pitjantjatjara language learning interactives, soundscapes, videos and artefacts. Explanations are provided in Pitjantjatjara, English, Italian, Japanese, German and French. A touch wall for visually impaired people ensures that the messages are accessible to everyone. Entry to the Cultural Centre is free.

The Walkatjara Art Centre is owned and operated by the local Aboriginal artists from the Mutitjulu Community. Most weekdays the Walkatjara Artists come to paint and work in the Art Room and receive a percentage of sales.

===Tourism===

The development of tourism infrastructure adjacent to the base of Uluru that began in the 1950s soon produced adverse environmental impacts. It was decided in the early 1970s to remove all accommodation-related tourist facilities and re-establish them outside the park. In 1975 a reservation of 104 square kilometres of land beyond the park&#x27;s northern boundary, 15 kilometres from Uluru, was approved for the development of a tourist facility and an associated airport, to be known as Yulara. The campground within the park was closed in 1983 and the motels finally closed in late 1984, coinciding with the opening of the Yulara resort. In 1992 the majority interest in the Yulara Resort held by the Northern Territory Government was sold and the resort was renamed &#x27;Ayers Rock Resort&#x27;.

The listing of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park ensures the park remains a world-class destination for both its cultural and natural heritage. Visitors will continue to have a unique cultural experience at the park and leave knowing that the park is managed according to cultural practices that date back tens of thousands of years.

Since the park was listed as a World Heritage Site, annual visitor numbers have risen to over 400,000 visitors in the year 2000. Increased tourism provides regional and national economic benefits. It also presents an ongoing challenge to balance conservation of cultural values and visitor needs.

There are a number of sightseeing and cultural tours to Uluru that offer walks that visitors can take around the major attractions of the park. The Base Walk is one of the best ways to see Uluru. Other walks surrounding Uluru include the Liru Walk, Mala Walk and Kuniya walk, while the sunrise and sunset viewing areas provide great photo opportunities.

The border of the national park is also home to the Longitude 131° Eco resort.

===Art centre gallery===
Maruku Arts is a large and successful Aboriginal Australian-owned and -operated enterprise, run by Anangu (people of the Western and Central Deserts of Australia). It has a warehouse based in Mutitjulu community (at the eastern end of the rock), a retail gallery at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Cultural Centre, as well as a market stall in Yulara town square. Its artwork consists mainly of paintings and woodcarvings. With about 900 artists in the collective, it provides an important source of income living in remote communities across central Australia. It seeks to &quot;keep culture strong and alive, for future generations of artists, and [to] make culture accessible in an authentic way to those that seek a more in-depth understanding&quot;.

Maruku is one of ten Indigenous-owned and -governed enterprises that go to make up the APY Art Centre Collective, established in 2013.

===Hiking and climbing===

The Uluru climb is the traditional route taken by ancestral Mala men upon their arrival to Uluru. Anangu do not climb Uluru because of its great spiritual significance.

The Valley of the Winds walk is an alternative to climbing Uluru and offers views of the landscape from two lookout points along the track. The walk is sometimes steep, rocky and difficult. For safety reasons this walk is closed under certain circumstances including heat, darkness and during rescue.

In November 2017, the national park&#x27;s board voted unanimously to ban climbing on Uluru and climbing has been banned since October 2019.

===Accommodations===

The Aboriginal community of Mutitjulu is inside the park area, but tourists must stay at the resorts in Yulara, just outside the national park. Ayers Rock Resort in Yulara offers a range of accommodation from camp sites to five-star luxury. There are also several dining options, a supermarket and a range of tour operators. The national park and town are served by Connellan Airport.

Slightly further afield is the luxury tented accommodation at Longitude 131, with views of Uluru from the tents.

Camping is not permitted in the park.

<text>Watarrka National Park is a protected area in the Northern Territory of Australia, which contains the popular Kings Canyon (Watarrka).

==Location==
The park is located about south of Darwin and southwest of Alice Springs. 

==History==
Watarrka National Park was established in 1989, on the traditional lands of the Matutjara people. It is named after the Aboriginal (Luritja and Arrernte) name for Kings Creek and Canyon &quot;watarrka&quot; (pronounced what-ARR-kah). This is the Luritja word for the local umbrella bush (&quot;Acacia ligulata&quot;) that grows in the vicinity.

The park was established on land owned by England-born Jack Cotterill and his two sons, Jack and Jim, who opened it up for tourism from their property, Wallara Ranch.

==Description==
The national park is categorised as an IUCN Category II protected area. On 25 March 1986, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

It contains the popular Kings Canyon (Watarrka) at the western end of the George Gill Range and Kathleen Springs, around to the southeast of Kings Canyon.

In 1986, Kings Canyon was described by the Department of Environment as follows:One of the most spectacular canyons in Central Australia. Kings Canyon contains some 60 rare or relict plant species and a total of 572 different plant species and 80 species of birds. It is a &#x27;living plant museum&#x27; and is notable for its stands of cycads &amp; permanent rock pools. There are some well-preserved Aboriginal paintings and engravings in the area...

<doc id="101663" wikidata="Q686947" url="?curid=101663" title="John Frost (Chartist)">
<text>John Frost (25 May 1784 – 27 July 1877) was a prominent leader of the British Chartist movement in the Newport Rising.

==Early life==
John Frost was born in Newport, Monmouthshire, where his father, also named John, kept the &quot;Royal Oak Inn&quot;, in Thomas Street (a blue plaque honouring Frost&#x27;s birthplace is located on the side of the old Post Office in the High Street, marking the approximate street location). John was mainly brought up as an orphan by his grandfather, a bootmaker. He was apprenticed to a woollen draper in Bristol and was later a shopman in London. Frost&#x27;s political affiliations were greatly influenced by Thomas Paine and William Cobbett. John and Sarah Frost worshipped at Hope Baptist Chapel, situated behind the present day Commercial Street and Skinner Street and their eight children were all baptised there.

Frost&#x27;s mother Sarah died early in his childhood and he was brought up by his grandparents. He was apprenticed as a bootmaker to his grandfather and left home at the age of sixteen to become a draper&#x27;s apprentice and tailor, first in Cardiff, then Bristol and later London. He returned to Newport in 1806 to start his own business, which became prosperous. He married a widow Mary Geach in 1812 and over the course of eleven years they had eight children. He was held in great esteem and affection for his appealing character and was commended for being &quot;studious, quiet and obedient.&quot;

== Political career ==
In 1821, Frost became embroiled in a dispute with a Newport solicitor, Thomas Prothero, who was also Town Clerk, over his uncle&#x27;s will. In a letter Frost accused Prothero of being responsible for the former&#x27;s exclusion from the will. Prothero sued for libel and Frost was ordered to pay £1,000. Frost then accused Prothero of malpractice. Again, Prothero sued for libel and again won. In February 1823, Frost was imprisoned for six months and told in no uncertain terms that further accusations against Prothero would lead to a longer sentence.

After his release Frost turned his anger against Prothero&#x27;s friends and business partners, notably Sir Charles Morgan of Tredegar House and Park, a major Newport and south Wales landowner and industrialist. In a pamphlet of 1830, he accused Morgan of mistreating his many tenants and advocated electoral reform as a means of bringing Morgan and others like him to account. An appreciation both of Frost&#x27;s literary skill and his mounting exasperation can be gained from his letters, to Sir Charles Morgan himself amongst others. In the early 1830s Frost increasingly became a champion of universal suffrage.

Establishing himself as a prominent Chartist, he was elected in 1835 as a town councillor for Newport and appointed as a magistrate. He also became an Improvement Commissioner and Poor Law Guardian and the following year became Mayor of Newport. His aggressive behaviour and election as a delegate to the Chartist Convention in 1838 antagonised his old enemies. He was defeated in the mayoral election the following year and the Home Secretary also revoked his appointment as magistrate.

== Letter to Lord John Russell ==
Because of his continuing role within the Chartist Movement, Home Secretary Russell dismissed Frost from his position as justice of the peace. In response, while at a Chartist Convention in Pontypool, Frost responded to Russell in a straightforward letter, containing the contemporary Chartist songs of Wales, which gave expression to the feelings and determination of the Welsh coal miners:

Nonetheless, while the desire amongst the Welsh to rebel was ever stronger, Frost himself still wished to postpone the date of an uprising. By the end of October, the Welsh Chartists were holding daily meetings in Monmouthshire in an attempt to force an armed rebellion. Records suggest that ultimately, finding himself unable to postpone the date of an organised uprising any longer and still doubting its success, Frost burst into tears. A thirty-member conference ultimately fixed the date for 3 November.

== The Newport Rising ==

On 3–4 November 1839 John Frost, together with William Jones and Zephaniah Williams, led a Chartist march on the Westgate Inn in Newport. The rationale for the set piece confrontation remains opaque, although it may have its origins in Frost&#x27;s ambivalence towards the more violent attitudes of some of the Chartists, and the personal animus he bore towards some of the Newport establishment who were ensconced in the hotel along with 60 armed soldiers. The Chartist movement in south east Wales was chaotic in this period, after the arrest of Henry Vincent, a leading agitator, who was imprisoned nearby in Monmouth gaol and the feelings of the workers were running extremely high, too high for Frost to reason with and control. One of his contemporaries, William Price described Frost&#x27;s stance at the time of the Newport Rising as being akin to &quot;putting a sword in my hand and a rope around my neck.&quot;

The march, which had been gathering momentum over the course of the whole weekend as Frost and his associates led the protestors down from the valley towns above Newport, numbered some 3,000 when it entered the town. According to the plan, three columns from three directions were to march upon Newport and take the town before dawn. The contingent starting from Blackwood was commanded by Frost, the detachment coming from Nantyglo by Williams and the main body of Pontypool by Jones. The three columns were to meet at Risca, but this did not come to pass; owing to a storm raging in the night, all of them arrived late, and the worst trouble was that the delay gave the Newport authorities ample time to get wind of what was afoot and make ready to confront the coming armed Chartists. Special constables were sworn in hastily, the known Chartists of Newport were arrested and shut up in the Westgate Hotel where the mayor held 30 soldiers in reserve. The Chartist troops led by Frost, proceeding to the hotel at 9:30 am and demanding the surrender of the Chartist prisoners with armed menace, advanced to the door. When the soldiers posted in the hotel started firing, ten to fifteen Chartists died instantly, about 50 were wounded. The bloody event was over in 20 minutes. The Chartist miners were in a very bad strategic position, and the firing took them by surprise. When they withdrew, they met the contingent of Williams and outside the town, the column of Jones. &quot;The Times&quot; estimated that the strength of the Chartists contingent at 8,000 whilst the chartist Robert Gammage estimated 20,000.

Overall the battle of the Westgate lasted only about 25 minutes, but at its close some 22 people lay dead or dying and upwards of 50 had been injured. An eyewitness report spoke of one man, wounded with gunshot, lying on the ground, pleading for help until he died an hour later.

== Reprisal by the local council ==

The reprisal by the local council followed immediately. The three commanders and 150 Chartists were arrested in a short time. The rumour spread that the Chartists insurgents intended to take Cardiff on 5 November. The Cardiff magistrates were seized with panic: in addition to mobilising the special constables they built up serious military defences and the crew of an American vessel lying at anchor in the port were also brought to the aid of the authorities. After Newport, however the Welsh Valleys were wrapped in quiet, and even the English manufacturing districts were paralysed for a short while.

== Trial and sentencing ==
A reward of £100 was offered for Frost&#x27;s capture and he was arrested by solicitor and clerk Thomas Jones Phillips (an ancestor of Jack Whitehall and Michael Whitehall) and charged with high treason. Early in 1840, along with Jones and Williams, was tried at Monmouth&#x27;s Shire Hall. All three were found guilty and became the last men in Britain to be sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. The Chartists stood up as one man for the Newport leaders under sentences of death. O&#x27;Connor, O&#x27;Brien, Harney Taylor and other Chartists leaders free on bail rose to speak on their behalf. O&#x27;Connor offered one week&#x27;s income of the Northern Star for a Frost fund and retained one of the best lawyers of the time, Sir Frederick Pollock as defence counsel. Following a huge public outcry, however, these sentences were discussed by the Cabinet and on 1 February the Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, announced that the executions would be commuted to transportation for life.

On reaching Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (modern Tasmania), Frost was immediately sentenced to two years&#x27; hard labour for making a disparaging remark about Lord John Russell, the Colonial Secretary. Frost was indentured to a local storekeeper in New Town after his probation term ended in November 1843. He spent three years working as a clerk, before being sent to Bothwell in May 1846 and receiving his ticket of leave in November 1846. He worked as a school teacher in various locations around Tasmania for almost eight years until he received a conditional pardon on 27 Jun 1854.

Chartists in Britain continued to campaign for the release of Frost. Thomas Duncombe pleaded Frost&#x27;s case in the House of Commons but his attempt to secure a pardon in 1846 was unsuccessful. Duncombe refused to be defeated and in 1854 he persuaded the Prime Minister, Lord Aberdeen, to grant Frost a pardon on the condition that he never returned to Britain. Frost sailed for the United States six months after receiving his conditional pardon, with his daughter, Catherine, who had joined him in Tasmania, and toured the country, organised by William Prowting Roberts, lecturing on the supposed unfairness of the British system of government.

==Later life==

In 1856, when the residency condition was lifted, Frost was given an unconditional pardon and he straightaway sailed for Bristol, arriving on 12 July. He retired to Stapleton, near the city, but continued to publish articles advocating reform until his death there, aged 93, in 1877.

Frost was buried in the churchyard of the Church of the Holy Trinity with St Edmund, Horfield, Bristol in accordance with his will. In the 1980s Richard Frame found Frost&#x27;s lost grave site and organised for a new headstone to be created and erected on the site, with the aid of a grant from Newport council. The new headstone was unveiled by Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.

A plaque has been added to the wall of The Mynde in Caerleon reading:

John Frost Square, in Newport city centre, was named in his honour. A 1978 mural of the Newport Rising by Kenneth Budd in the square was demolished in 2013. A trust is to be set up to commission a new memorial with £50,000 of funding provided by Newport City Council. A planning application was approved on 3 Apr 2019 to set up a quarter-scale replica of the Newport Rising mural in Rogerstone, three miles from the city centre. Kenneth Budd&#x27;s son Oliver has been commissioned to make it using the original drawings from 1978. In 1991, three statues by Christopher Kelly commemorating the Chartist Newport Rising entitled &quot;Union, Prudence, Energy&quot; were installed outside the Westgate Hotel in Newport.

<text>The Miami (Miami–Illinois: &quot;Myaamiaki&quot;) are a Native American nation originally speaking the Miami–Illinois language, one of the Algonquian languages. Among the peoples known as the Great Lakes tribes, they occupied territory that is now identified as north-central Indiana, southwest Michigan, and western Ohio. The Miami were historically made up of several prominent subgroups, including the Piankeshaw, Wea, Pepikokia, Kilatika, Mengakonkia, and Atchakangouen. In modern times, Miami is used more specifically to refer to the Atchakangouen. By 1846, most of the Miami had been forcefully displaced to Indian Territory (initially to what is now Kansas, and later to what is now part of Oklahoma). The Miami Tribe of Oklahoma are the federally recognized tribe of Miami Indians in the United States. The Miami Nation of Indiana, a nonprofit organization of self-identified descendants of Miamis who were exempted from removal, have unsuccessfully sought separate recognition.

==Name==
The name Miami derives from &quot;Myaamia&quot; (plural &quot;Myaamiaki&quot;), the tribe&#x27;s autonym (name for themselves) in their Algonquian language of Miami–Illinois. This appears to have been derived from an older term meaning &quot;downstream people.&quot; Some scholars contended the Miami called themselves the Twightwee (also spelled &quot;Twatwa&quot;), supposedly an onomatopoeic reference to their sacred bird, the sandhill crane. Recent studies have shown that &quot;Twightwee&quot; derives from the Delaware language exonym for the Miamis, &quot;tuwéhtuwe&quot;, a name of unknown etymology. Some Miami have stated that this was only a name used by other tribes for the Miami, and not their autonym. They also called themselves &quot;Mihtohseeniaki&quot; (the people). The Miami continue to use this autonym today.


==History==

===Prehistory===
Early Miami people are considered to belong to the Fisher Tradition of Mississippian culture. Mississippian societies were characterized by maize-based agriculture, chiefdom-level social organization, extensive regional trade networks, hierarchical settlement patterns, and other factors. The historical Miami engaged in hunting, as did other Mississippian peoples.

Written history of the Miami traces back to missionaries and explorers who encountered them in what is now Wisconsin, from which they migrated south and eastwards from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century, settling on the upper Wabash River and the Maumee River in what is now northeastern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. By oral history, this migration was a return to the region where they had long lived before being invaded during the Beaver Wars by the Iroquois. Early European colonists and traders on the East Coast had fueled demand for furs, and the Iroquois – based in central and western New York – had acquired early access to European firearms through trade and had used them to conquer the Ohio Valley area for use as hunting grounds, which temporarily depopulated as Algonquin woodlands tribes fled west as refugees. The warfare and ensuing social disruption – along with the spread of infectious European diseases such as measles and smallpox for which they had no immunity – contributed to the decimation of Native American populations in the interior.

Historic locations

===European contact===

When French missionaries first encountered the Miami in the mid-17th century, generating the first written historical record of the tribe, the indigenous people were living around the western shores of Lake Michigan. According to Miami oral tradition, they had moved there a few generations earlier from the region that is now northern Indiana, southern Michigan, and northwestern Ohio to escape pressure from Iroquois war parties seeking to monopolize control over furs in the Ohio Valley. Early French explorers noticed many linguistic and cultural similarities between the Miami bands and the Illiniwek, a loose confederacy of Algonquian-speaking peoples. The term &quot;Miami&quot; has imprecise meaning to historians. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the term &quot;Miami&quot; generally referred to all of these bands as one grand tribe. Over the course of the 19th century, &quot;Miami&quot; came to specifically refer to the Atchakangoen (Crane) band.

Around the beginning of the 18th century, with support from French traders coming down from what is now Canada who supplied them with firearms and wanted to trade with them for furs, the Miami pushed back into their historical territory and resettled it. At this time, the major bands of the Miami were:
*Atchakangouen, Atchatchakangouen, Atchakangouen, Greater Miami or Crane Band (named after their leading clan, largest Miami band – their main village was Kekionga / Kiihkayonki (&quot;blackberry bush&quot;) at the confluence of the Saint Joseph (Kociihsa Siipiiwi) (″Bean River″), Saint Marys (Nameewa Siipiiwi/Mameewa Siipiiwi) (″River of the Atlantic sturgeon″) and Maumee River (Taawaawa Siipiiwi) (″River of the Odawa″) on the western edge of the Great Black Swamp in present-day Indiana – this place was although called &quot;saakiiweeki taawaawa siipiiwi&quot; (lit. ″the confluence of the Maumee River″); &quot;Kekionga / Kiihkayonki&quot; was although the capital of the Miami confederacy) 
*Kilatika, Kilatak, Kiratika called by the French, later known by the English as Eel River Band &quot;of Miamis&quot;; autonym: Kineepikomeekwaki (″People along the Snake-Fish-River, i.e. Eel River″, their main village &quot;Kineepikwameekwa/Kenapekwamakwah/Kenapocomoco&quot; (&quot;Snake-Fish-Town&quot; or &quot;Eel River Village&quot;) moved its location from the headwaters of the Eel River (Kineepikwameekwa Siipiiwi) (&quot;Snake-Fish-River&quot;) (near Columbia City, Indiana) down to its mouth at the Wabash River (Waapaahšiki Siipiiwi) (″Shining White River/Bright Shiny River″) (near Logansport, Indiana) in northern Indiana; the &quot;Kilatika Band&quot; of the French years had their main village at the confluence of the Kankakee River and Des Plaines Rivers to form the Illinois River about 16 km southwest of today&#x27;s Joliet, Illinois)
*Mengakonkia or Mengkonkia, Michikinikwa (&quot;Little Turtle&quot;)&#x27; people
*Pepikokia, Pepicokea, later known as Tepicon Band or Tippecanoe Band; autonym: Kiteepihkwana (″People of the Place of the buffalo fish″), their main village &quot;Kithtippecanuck / Kiteepihkwana&quot; (″Place of the buffalo fish″) moved its location various times from the headwaters of the Tippecanoe River (Kiteepihkwana siipiiwi) (″River of the buffalo fish″) (east of Old Tip Town, Indiana) to its mouth into the Wabash River (Waapaahšiki Siipiiwi) (near Lafayette, Indiana) – sometimes although known as &quot;Nation de la Gruë&quot; or &quot;Miamis of Meramec River&quot;, possibly the name of a Miami–Illinois band named &quot;Myaarameekwa&quot; (″Ugly Fish, i.e. Catfish Band″) that lived along the Meramec River (″River of the ugly fish″)
*Piankeshaw, Piankashaw, Pianguichia; autonym: Peeyankihšiaki (″those who separate″ or ″those who split of″) lived in several villages along the White River in western Indiana, the Vermilion River (Peeyankihšiaki Siipiiwi) (″River of the Peeyankihšiaki/Piankashaw″) and Wabash Rivers (Waapaahšiki Siipiiwi) in Illinois and later along the Great Miami River (Ahsenisiipi) (″Rocky River″) in western Ohio, their first main village &quot;Peeyankihšionki&quot; (″Place of the Peeyankihšiaki/Piankashaw″) was at the confluence of Vermilion River and the Wabash River (near Cayuga, Indiana) – one minor settlement was at the confluence of the main tributaries of the Vermilion River (near Danville, Illinois), the second important settlement was named &quot;Aciipihkahkionki / Chippekawkay / Chippecoke&quot; (″Place of the &quot;edible&quot; Root″) and was situated at the mouth of the Embarras River in the Wabash River (near Vincennes, Indiana), in the 18th century a third settlement outside the historic Wabash River Valley named &quot;Pinkwaawilenionki / Pickawillany&quot; (″Ash Place″) was erected along the Great Miami River (which developed into Piqua, Ohio)
*Wea, Wiatonon, Ouiatanon or Ouaouiatanoukak; autonym: Waayaahtanooki or Waayaahtanwa (″People of the place of the whirlpool″), because their main village &quot;Waayaahtanonki&quot; (″Place of the whirlpool″) was at the riverside where a whirlpool was in the river, under the term &quot;Ouiatanon&quot; was both referred to a group of extinct five Wea settlements or to their historic tribal lands along the Middle Wabash Valley between the Eel River to the north and the Vermilion River to the south, the ″real″&quot;Quiatanon&quot; at the mouth of the Wea Creek into the Wabash River was their main village

In 1696, the Comte de Frontenac appointed Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes as commander of the French outposts in northeast Indiana and southwest Michigan. He befriended the Miami people, settling first at the St. Joseph River, and, in 1704, establishing a trading post and fort at &quot;Kekionga&quot;, present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana, the de facto Miami capital which controlled an important land portage linking the Maumee River (which flowed into Lake Erie and offered a water path to Quebec) to the Wabash River (which flowed into the Ohio River and offered a water path to the Mississippi Valley).

By the 18th century, the Miami had for the most part returned to their homeland in present-day Indiana and Ohio. The eventual victory of the British in the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War) led to an increased British presence in traditional Miami areas.

Shifting alliances and the gradual encroachment of European-American settlement led to some Miami bands, including the &quot;Piankeshaw&quot;, and &quot;Wea,&quot; effectively merging into what was sometimes called the Miami Confederacy. Native Americans created larger tribal confederacies led by Chief Little Turtle; their alliances were for waging war against Europeans and to fight advancing white settlement, and the broader Miami itself became a subset of the so-called Western Confederacy during the Northwest Indian War.

The U.S. government later included the Miami with the Illini for administrative purposes. The Eel River band maintained a somewhat separate status, which proved beneficial in the removals of the 19th century. The Miami nation&#x27;s traditional capital was &quot;Kekionga&quot;.

===United States and Tribal Divide===

The Miami had mixed relations with the United States. Some villages of the Piankeshaw openly supported the American rebel colonists during the American Revolution, while the villages around &quot;Ouiatenon&quot; were openly hostile. The Miami of Kekionga remained allies of the British, but were not openly hostile to the United States (except when attacked by Augustin de La Balme in 1780).

In the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War, Britain transferred its claim of sovereignty over the Northwest Territory – modern-day Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin – to the new United States. White pioneers pushed into the Ohio Valley, leading to disputes over whether they had a legal right to carve out homesteads and settlements on land the tribes considered unceded territory. The Miami invited tribes displaced by white settlers, the Delaware (Lenape) and Shawnee to resettle at Kekionga, forming the nucleus of the pan-tribal Western Confederacy. War parties attacked white settlers, seeking to drive them out, and whites – including Kentucky militia members – carried out sometimes indiscriminate reprisal attacks on Native American villages. The resulting conflict became known as the Northwest Indian War.

Seeking to bring an end to the rising violence by forcing the tribes to sign treaties ceding land for white settlement, the George Washington administration ordered an attack on Kekionga in 1790; American forces destroyed it but were then repulsed by Little Turtle&#x27;s warriors. In 1791, Lieutenant Colonel James Wilkinson launched what he thought was a clever raid. At the Battle of Kenapacomaqua, Wilkinson killed 9 Wea and Miami, and captured 34 Miami as prisoners, including a daughter of Miami war chief Little Turtle. Many of the confederation leaders had been considering terms of peace to present to the United States, but when they received news of Wilkinson&#x27;s raid, they readied for war. Wilkinson&#x27;s raid thus had the opposite effect and united the tribes for a war. Later in 1791, the Washington administration organized a second expedition to attack Kekionga with further orders to build a fort there to permanently occupy the region, but the Western Confederacy attacked its camp en route and destroyed it; the battle, known as St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat, is recognized as the worst defeat of an American army by Native Americans in U.S. history. In 1794, a third invading force under General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne defeated the confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, burned tribal settlements along dozens of miles of the Maumee River, and erected Fort Wayne at Kekionga. Wayne then imposed the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, which ended the Northwest Indian War. Under it, confederacy leaders like Little Turtle agreed to cede most of what is now Ohio, along with other tracts to the west including what is now central Detroit, Chicago, and Fort Wayne, in exchange for annual payments.

Those Miami who still resented the United States gathered around Ouiatenon and Prophetstown, where Shawnee Chief Tecumseh led a coalition of Native American nations. Territorial governor William Henry Harrison and his forces destroyed Prophetstown in 1811, and in the War of 1812 – which included a tribal siege of Fort Wayne – attacked Miami villages throughout the Indiana Territory.

Although Wayne had promised in the Treaty of Greenville negotiations that the remaining unceded territory would remain tribal land – the origin of the name &quot;Indiana&quot; – forever, that is not what happened. Wayne would die a year later. White traders who came to Fort Wayne were used by the government to deliver the annual treaty payments to the Miami and other tribes. The traders also sold them alcohol and manufactured goods. Between annuity days, the traders sold them such things on credit, and the tribes repeatedly ran up more debts than the existing payments could cover. Harrison and his successors pursued a policy of leveraging these debts to induce tribal leaders to sign new treaties ceding large swaths of collectively-held reservation land and then to agree to the tribe&#x27;s removal. As incentives to induce tribal leaders to sign such treaties, the government gave them individual deeds and other personal perks, such as building one chief a mansion. In 1846, the government forced the tribe&#x27;s rank-and-file to leave, but several major families who had acquired private property to live on through this practice were exempted and permitted to stay in Indiana, creating a bitter schism.

Those who affiliated with the tribe were moved to first to Kansas, then to Oklahoma, where they were given individual allotments of land rather than a reservation as part of efforts to make them assimilate into the American culture of private property and yeoman farming. The U.S. government has recognized what is now the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma as the official tribal government since 1846.

In the 20th century, the Indiana-based Miami unsuccessfully sought separate federal recognition. Although they had been recognized by the U.S. in an 1854 treaty, that recognition was stripped in 1897. In 1980, the Indiana legislature recognized the Eastern Miami as a matter of state law and voted to support federal recognition, but in 1993, a federal judge ruled that the statute of limitations on appealing their status had expired. In 1996, the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma changed its constitution to permit any descendant of people on certain historical roles to join, and since then hundreds of Indiana-based Miami have become members. Today the Oklahoma-based Miami tribe has about 5,600 enrolled members. However many other Indiana-based Miami still consider themselves a separate group that has been unfairly denied separate federal recognition. The Miami Nation of Indiana does not have federal tribal recognition. Senate Bill No. 311 was introduced in the Indiana General Assembly in 2011 to formally grant state recognition to the tribe, giving it sole authority to determine its tribal membership, but the bill did not advance to a vote.

<text>The Battle of Lützen, fought on 16 November 1632, is considered one of the most important battles of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Led by the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus, an Allied army primarily composed of troops from Sweden, Saxony, and Hesse-Kassel, narrowly defeated an Imperial force under Albrecht von Wallenstein. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, with Gustavus himself among the dead. 

Wallenstein deployed his men in defensive positions, and the battle began with a series of frontal attacks by the Allied infantry. These nearly succeeded in breaking through before being repulsed with severe losses by Imperial cavalry under Pappenheim. Gustavus was killed as they fell back, but re-formed by his subordinates, his infantry overran the Imperial centre just before nightfall, supported by close range artillery fire. Wallenstein withdrew his remaining troops in good order, but was forced to abandon his wounded, many of his guns, and most of his supply train. 

Despite the loss of their king, the Swedes continued the war under the direction of Axel Oxenstierna. Backed by French subsidies, in April 1633 Sweden formed the Heilbronn League with their German allies, and shortly afterwards defeated an Imperial army at Oldendorf. In February 1634, rumours that Wallenstein was about to change sides resulted in his assassination by Imperial agents.

==Background==
Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years&#x27; War began in June 1630 when nearly 18,000 troops under Gustavus Adolphus landed in the Duchy of Pomerania. Backed by French subsidies and supported by Saxony and Brandenburg-Prussia, he defeated Imperial armies at Breitenfeld in September 1631, then Rain in April 1632. However, this drew him deep into Southern Germany and Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein established himself at Fürth, threatening to cut his lines of communication to the north. On 3 September, an assault on the Imperial camp outside the town was bloodily repulsed, arguably the greatest blunder committed by Gustavus during his German campaign.

After this success, Wallenstein joined Heinrich Holk in attacking Saxony, hoping to force John George I, Elector of Saxony, out of the war and obliging Gustavus to follow him. Leipzig was captured in early November and on 14th Wallenstein decided to establish winter quarters there. However, next day the Swedes learned Pappenheim&#x27;s corps of 5,800 men had been detached and sent to Halle, leaving Wallenstein with between 13,000 to 15,000 men. Since this gave Gustavus and his 19,000 men numerical superiority, he decided to attack and quickly advanced from his base at Naumburg. As well as troops in Swedish service, his force included 850 from Hesse-Kassel and some 2,000 Saxons, although their main army was absent. 

On the evening of the 15th of November, the Swedish/German army camped in battle formation two kilometres outside Lützen, ready to attack next day. Advised of their movements by his scouts, Wallenstein ordered Pappenheim to return as quickly as possible. The latter set off with his cavalry just after midnight on 6 November, leaving the infantry to follow, while Wallenstein&#x27;s troops worked through the night building defensive positions along the main Lützen-Leipzig road, also known as the &quot;Via Regia&quot;. The ground was mostly flat, except on the Imperial right, which Wallenstein anchored on a low hill next to three windmills, supported by his main artillery battery.

==Battle==
The Swedish advance was hampered first by morning mist, then having to cross the Flossgraben canal (see Map). As a result, their attack did not begin until 11:00 am, a delay which gave Pappenheim time to reach the battlefield and negated the initial Swedish numerical superiority. Although Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar made little progress against Wallenstein&#x27;s right, Gustavus overran a line of musketeers holding the ditch along the Lützen-Leipzig road, crossed it, then swung round to outflank the Imperial left. This was the situation around 12:00 pm when Pappenheim arrived on the battlefield with 2,300 cavalry.

He immediately charged and drove the Swedish infantry back across the road, with several elite units effectively wiped out or losing up to 65% of their strength. The Imperial troops also suffered heavy casualties, particularly among their senior officers, including Pappenheim, who was fatally wounded and died while being evacuated in a coach. At the same time, Holk launched a counterattack on the Swedish centre; by 13:00, both armies were losing cohesion and the battle degenerated into a confused series of firefights between opposing units.

By now, officers on both sides were trying to reorganise their troops, the smoke from the burning houses in Lützen blowing across the battlefield and making it almost impossible to see. While trying to rally his shattered infantry, Gustavus and his entourage got lost and ran into an Imperial cavalry unit; he was shot three times and fell dead from his horse, his body not recovered until after the fighting ended that evening. The Swedish reserve under Knyphausen managed to hold the line, providing time for their colleagues to reform and the fighting paused around 15:00.

Although news of Gustavus&#x27; death soon spread, Wallenstein himself refused to believe it, while many of his own troops were in equally bad shape. Much of Pappenheim&#x27;s cavalry fled and told the infantry coming from Halle the battle was lost, although the latter continued marching towards Lützen. Several units looted their own baggage train, accompanied by camp followers who escaped on the horses needed to transport guns and supply wagons.

There are few reliable eyewitness accounts for the second phase of the battle and events are thus harder to reconstruct. One suggestion is Knyphausen advised retreat but when Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar continued his attack on the Imperial left, he moved his troops forward and crossed the Via Regia once again. As they did so, they captured the small battery in the centre (see Battle Map) and used it to fire on the Imperial left, which slowly withdrew out of range. Around 16:00, Bernard of Saxe-Weimar finally over-ran Lützen, then seized the main Imperial battery next to the windmills which were turned on his retreating opponents.

By 17:00 and with dusk falling, fighting subsided as Wallenstein ordered his troops to retire, abandoning his guns and baggage. After marching all day, Pappenheim&#x27;s infantry, about 2,900 strong, arrived on the battlefield after nightfall; they wished to counterattack but instead Wallenstein ordered them to cover his retreat into Leipzig. The Swedes were finally able to recover the body of their king from under a heap of corpses on the Imperial side of the ditch which had been the scene of bitter fighting throughout the day.

==Aftermath==
While Imperial casualties of 5,160 killed or wounded were lower than Swedish losses of around 6,000, Wallenstein decided he could not hold Leipzig and withdrew into Bohemia, leaving behind over 1,200 wounded, who were taken prisoner. During this retreat, the Imperialists were harassed by Saxon peasantry angry at the destruction of their crops, and suffered significant additional casualties. This allowed the Swedes to claim Lützen as a victory, while they also achieved their tactical objective of forcing Wallenstein out of Saxony, but the battle is chiefly significant for the death of Gustavus.

Although his loss caused dismay at home and within the wider European Protestant community, Sweden&#x27;s allies were more ambivalent. French chief minister Cardinal Richelieu, whose financial subsidies funded the Swedish army, had increasingly clashed with Gustavus over strategic objectives. While there is no evidence for contemporary rumours that Richelieu was involved, his death cemented French leadership of the anti-Habsburg alliance. Saxony and Brandenburg had grown disillusioned with the Swedish alliance, which led to heavy loss of civilian life from plague and starvation, while the occupation of Swedish Pomerania threatened their own interests in the Baltic trade.

Since Gustavus was succeeded by his six year old daughter Christina, direction of policy was taken over by the Privy Council of Sweden, headed by Axel Oxenstierna. Appointed Chancellor in January 1633, he decided Sweden could gain adequate compensation for its investment only by continuing the war. After ensuring control of the army, he next moved to replace the previous loose alliance with a more formal structure, largely driven by doubts over the reliability of his allies. 

Richelieu resumed payment of subsidies to Sweden on 7 April and on 27th, Sweden and its German Protestant allies formed the Heilbronn League. Oxenstierna was appointed League Director, with an absolute veto over military affairs, supported by a council of ten advisors, three of whom were Swedes. Its members agreed to support an army of 78,000 men, although they provided less than a third of the money needed; the balance was paid by France to Sweden directly, ensuring control over the League. The German states agreed to continue fighting until Sweden obtained &quot;just compensation,&quot; while Oxenstierna promised them a return to pre-1618 borders. In July, the coalition defeated an Imperial army under von Gronsfeld at Oldendorf; Wallenstein&#x27;s alleged refusal to support his colleague and rumours he was contemplating switching sides led to his removal and assassination by Imperial agents in February 1634.

==Legacy==
The day after the battle, a granite boulder was placed near the spot where Gustavus Adolphus fell, known as the &quot;&quot;; in 1832, an iron canopy was erected over the stone, with a chapel built nearby in 1907. The battle was fought on 16 November according to the Gregorian calendar or 6 November according to the Julian calendar, which was then in use in Sweden. Despite adopting the Gregorian calendar in 1753, the Swedes still commemorate Gustavus Adolphus Day on 6 November each year.

In 2011, a mass grave containing the remains of 47 soldiers was found in an area where a Swedish unit known as the Blue Brigade was reportedly overrun by Pappenheim&#x27;s cavalry. Examination of the remains showed the average age was 28, while evidence of healed injuries indicate they were veterans; more than half had been hit by gunfire, an unusually high number for this period.

<text>The Matchmaker is a 1954 Broadway play by Thornton Wilder, a rewritten version of his 1938 play &quot;The Merchant of Yonkers&quot;.

==History==

The play has a long and colorful history. John Oxenford&#x27;s 1835 one-act farce &quot;A Day Well Spent&quot; had been extended into the full-length play &quot;Einen Jux will er sich machen&quot; (&quot;He&#x27;ll Have Himself a Good Time&quot;) by Austrian playwright Johann Nestroy in 1842. In 1938, Wilder adapted Nestroy&#x27;s version into the Americanized comedy &quot;The Merchant of Yonkers&quot;, which attracted the attention of German director Max Reinhardt, who mounted a Broadway production, which was a flop, running for only 39 performances.

Fifteen years later, director Tyrone Guthrie expressed interest in a new production of the play, which Wilder extensively rewrote and rechristened &quot;The Matchmaker&quot;. The most significant change was the expansion of a previously minor character named Dolly Gallagher Levi, who became the play&#x27;s centerpiece. A widow who brokers marriages and other transactions in Yonkers, New York at the turn of the 20th century, she sets her sights on local merchant Horace Vandergelder, who has hired her to find him a wife. After a series of slapstick situations involving mistaken identities, secret rendezvous behind carefully placed screens, separated lovers, and a trip to night court, everyone finds themselves paired with a perfect match.

==Productions==

The play, starring Ruth Gordon as Dolly and Sam Levene as Horace Vandergelder, debuted at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland on November 4, 1954; at the Edinburgh Festival, in Berlin—for the troops and at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London&#x27;s West End. Due to a salary dispute with Broadway producer David Merrick, Sam Levene left the production after playing the role of Horace Vandergelder for over a year in Europe. Loring Smith replaced Levene as Horace Vandergelder and opened on Broadway December 5, 1955 at the Royale Theatre, later transferring to the Booth to complete its run of 486 performances. Ruth Gordon&#x27;s performance in the title role earned her a Tony Award nomination as Best Actress; Guthrie won as Best Director.

==Adaptations==

The 1958 film version, adapted by John Michael Hayes and directed by Joseph Anthony, starred Shirley Booth as Dolly, Anthony Perkins as Cornelius, Shirley MacLaine as Irene, Paul Ford as Vandergelder, and Robert Morse reprising his Broadway role as Barnaby.

The story enjoyed yet another incarnation in 1964 when David Merrick, who had produced the 1955 Broadway play, partnered with composer Jerry Herman to mount the hugely successful, Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; starring Carol Channing.

A film version of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; was released in 1969 starring Barbra Streisand in the lead role.

<text>robots.txt is the filename used for implementing the Robots Exclusion Protocol, a standard used by websites to indicate to visiting web crawlers and other web robots which portions of the website they are allowed to visit.

The standard, developed in 1994, relies on voluntary compliance. Malicious bots can use the file as a directory of which pages to visit, though standards bodies discourage countering this with security through obscurity. Some archival sites ignore robots.txt. The standard was used in the 1990s to mitigate server overload. In the 2020s, websites began denying bots that collect information for generative artificial intelligence.

The &quot;robots.txt&quot; file can be used in conjunction with sitemaps, another robot inclusion standard for websites.

==History==
The standard was proposed by Martijn Koster, when working for Nexor in February 1994 on the &quot;www-talk&quot; mailing list, the main communication channel for WWW-related activities at the time. Charles Stross claims to have provoked Koster to suggest robots.txt, after he wrote a badly behaved web crawler that inadvertently caused a denial-of-service attack on Koster&#x27;s server.

The standard, initially RobotsNotWanted.txt, allowed web developers to specify which bots should not access their website or which pages bots should not access. The internet was small enough in 1994 to maintain a complete list of all bots; server overload was a primary concern. By June 1994 it had become a &quot;de facto&quot; standard; most complied, including those operated by search engines such as WebCrawler, Lycos, and AltaVista.

On July 1, 2019, Google announced the proposal of the Robots Exclusion Protocol as an official standard under Internet Engineering Task Force. A proposed standard was published in September 2022 as RFC 9309.

==Standard==
When a site owner wishes to give instructions to web robots they place a text file called in the root of the web site hierarchy (e.g. ). This text file contains the instructions in a specific format (see examples below). Robots that choose to follow the instructions try to fetch this file and read the instructions before fetching any other file from the website. If this file does not exist, web robots assume that the website owner does not wish to place any limitations on crawling the entire site.

A robots.txt file contains instructions for bots indicating which web pages they can and cannot access. Robots.txt files are particularly important for web crawlers from search engines such as Google.

A robots.txt file on a website will function as a request that specified robots ignore specified files or directories when crawling a site. This might be, for example, out of a preference for privacy from search engine results, or the belief that the content of the selected directories might be misleading or irrelevant to the categorization of the site as a whole, or out of a desire that an application only operates on certain data. Links to pages listed in robots.txt can still appear in search results if they are linked to from a page that is crawled.

A robots.txt file covers one origin. For websites with multiple subdomains, each subdomain must have its own robots.txt file. If had a robots.txt file but did not, the rules that would apply for would not apply to . In addition, each protocol and port needs its own robots.txt file; does not apply to pages under or .

==Compliance==
The robots.txt protocol is widely complied with by bot operators. 

===Search engines===
Some major search engines following this standard include Ask, AOL, Baidu, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Kagi, Google, Yahoo!, and Yandex.

===Archival sites===
Some web archiving projects ignore robots.txt. Archive Team uses the file to discover more links, such as sitemaps. Co-founder Jason Scott said that &quot;unchecked, and left alone, the robots.txt file ensures no mirroring or reference for items that may have general use and meaning beyond the website&#x27;s context.&quot; In 2017, the Internet Archive announced that it would stop complying with robots.txt directives. According to &quot;Digital Trends&quot;, this followed widespread use of robots.txt to remove historical sites from search engine results, and contrasted with the nonprofit&#x27;s aim to archive &quot;snapshots&quot; of the internet as it previously existed.

===Artificial intelligence===
Starting in the 2020s, web operators began using robots.txt to deny access to bots collecting training data for generative AI. In 2023, Originality.AI found that 306 of the thousand most-visited websites blocked OpenAI&#x27;s GPTBot in their robots.txt file and 85 blocked Google&#x27;s Google-Extended. Many robots.txt files named GPTBot as the only bot explicitly disallowed on all pages. Denying access to GPTBot was common among news websites such as the BBC and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 2023, blog host Medium announced it would deny access to all artificial intelligence web crawlers as &quot;AI companies have leached value from writers in order to spam Internet readers&quot;.

GPTBot complies with the robots.txt standard and gives advice to web operators about how to disallow it, but &quot;The Verge&quot;″s David Pierce said this only began after &quot;training the underlying models that made it so powerful&quot;. Also, some bots are used both for search engines and artificial intelligence, and it may be impossible to block only one of these options. &quot;404 Media&quot; reported that companies like Anthropic and Perplexity.ai circumvented robots.txt by renaming or spinning up new scrapers to replace the ones that appeared on popular blocklists.

==Security==
Despite the use of the terms &quot;allow&quot; and &quot;disallow&quot;, the protocol is purely advisory and relies on the compliance of the web robot; it cannot enforce any of what is stated in the file. Malicious web robots are unlikely to honor robots.txt; some may even use the robots.txt as a guide to find disallowed links and go straight to them. While this is sometimes claimed to be a security risk, this sort of &quot;security through obscurity&quot; is discouraged by standards bodies. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States specifically recommends against this practice: &quot;System security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components.&quot; In the context of robots.txt files, security through obscurity is not recommended as a security technique.

==Alternatives==
Many robots also pass a special user-agent to the web server when fetching content. A web administrator could also configure the server to automatically return failure (or pass alternative content) when it detects a connection using one of the robots.

Some sites, such as Google, host a codice_1 file that displays information meant for humans to read. Some sites such as GitHub redirect humans.txt to an &quot;About&quot; page.

Previously, Google had a joke file hosted at codice_2 instructing the Terminator not to kill the company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

==Examples==
This example tells all robots that they can visit all files because the wildcard codice_3 stands for all robots and the codice_4 directive has no value, meaning no pages are disallowed.

This example has the same effect, allowing all files rather than prohibiting none.

The same result can be accomplished with an empty or missing robots.txt file.

This example tells all robots to stay out of a website:

This example tells all robots not to enter three directories:

This example tells all robots to stay away from one specific file:

All other files in the specified directory will be processed.

This example tells two specific robots not to enter one specific directory:

Example demonstrating how comments can be used:

It is also possible to list multiple robots with their own rules. The actual robot string is defined by the crawler. A few robot operators, such as Google, support several user-agent strings that allow the operator to deny access to a subset of their services by using specific user-agent strings.

Example demonstrating multiple user-agents:

=== Difference Between codice_5 and codice_6 ===
The directive codice_5 blocks all files and subdirectories starting with codice_8. In contrast, codice_6 (if supported by the crawler) blocks URLs with more complex patterns, such as codice_10. The wildcard codice_3 allows greater flexibility but may not be recognized by all crawlers.

==Nonstandard extensions==

===Crawl-delay directive===
The crawl-delay value is supported by some crawlers to throttle their visits to the host. Since this value is not part of the standard, its interpretation is dependent on the crawler reading it. It is used when the multiple burst of visits from bots is slowing down the host. Yandex interprets the value as the number of seconds to wait between subsequent visits. Bing defines crawl-delay as the size of a time window (from 1 to 30 seconds) during which BingBot will access a web site only once. Google ignores this directive, but provides an interface in its search console for webmasters, to control the Googlebot&#x27;s subsequent visits.

===Sitemap===
Some crawlers support a codice_12 directive, allowing multiple Sitemaps in the same &lt;samp&gt;robots.txt&lt;/samp&gt; in the form codice_13:
===Universal &quot;*&quot; match===
The &quot;Robot Exclusion Standard&quot; does not mention the &quot;*&quot; character in the codice_14 statement.

==Meta tags and headers==
In addition to root-level robots.txt files, robots exclusion directives can be applied at a more granular level through the use of Robots meta tags and X-Robots-Tag HTTP headers. The robots meta tag cannot be used for non-HTML files such as images, text files, or PDF documents. On the other hand, the X-Robots-Tag can be added to non-HTML files by using .htaccess and httpd.conf files.

===A &quot;noindex&quot; meta tag===

&lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;noindex&quot; /&gt;
===A &quot;noindex&quot; HTTP response header===

X-Robots-Tag: noindex
The X-Robots-Tag is only effective after the page has been requested and the server responds, and the robots meta tag is only effective after the page has loaded, whereas robots.txt is effective before the page is requested. Thus if a page is excluded by a robots.txt file, any robots meta tags or X-Robots-Tag headers are effectively ignored because the robot will not see them in the first place.

===Maximum size of a robots.txt file===
The Robots Exclusion Protocol requires crawlers to parse at least 500 kibibytes (512000 bytes) of robots.txt files, which Google maintains as a 500 kibibyte file size restriction for robots.txt files.

<text>VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language, pronounced &quot;vermal&quot; or by its initials, originally—before 1995—known as the Virtual Reality Markup Language) is a standard file format for representing 3-dimensional (3D) interactive vector graphics, designed particularly with the World Wide Web in mind. It has been superseded by X3D.

==WRL file format==

VRML is a text file format where, e.g., vertices and edges for a 3D polygon can be specified along with the surface color, UV-mapped textures, shininess, transparency, and so on. URLs can be associated with graphical components so that a web browser might fetch a webpage or a new VRML file from the Internet when the user clicks on the specific graphical component. Animations, sounds, lighting, and other aspects of the virtual world can interact with the user or may be triggered by external events such as timers. A special Script Node allows the addition of program code (e.g., written in Java or ECMAScript) to a VRML file.

VRML files are commonly called &quot;worlds&quot; and have the extension (for example, ). VRML files are in plain text and generally compress well using gzip, useful for transferring over the Internet more quickly (some gzip compressed files use the extension). Many 3D modeling programs can save objects and scenes in VRML format.

==Standardization==

The Web3D Consortium has been formed to further the collective development of the format. VRML (and its successor, X3D), have been accepted as international standards by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

The first version of VRML was specified in November 1994. This version was specified from, and very closely resembled, the API and file format of the Open Inventor software component, originally developed by SGI. Version 2.0 development was guided by the ad hoc VRML Architecture Group (VAG). A working draft was published in August 1996. Formal collaboration between the VAG and SC24 of ISO/IEC began in 1996 and VRML 2.0 was submitted to ISO for adoption as an international standard. The current and functionally complete version is VRML97 (ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997). VRML has now been superseded by X3D (ISO/IEC 19775-1).

==Emergence, popularity, and rival technical upgrade==

The term VRML was coined by Dave Raggett in a paper called &quot;Extending WWW to support Platform Independent Virtual Reality&quot; submitted to the First World Wide Web Conference in 1994, and first discussed at the WWW94 VRML BOF established by Tim Berners-Lee, where Mark Pesce presented the Labyrinth demo he developed with Tony Parisi and Peter Kennard. VRML was introduced to a wider audience in the SIGGRAPH Course, VRML: Using 3D to Surf the Web in August 1995. In October 1995, at Internet World, Template Graphics Software (TGS) demonstrated a 3D/VRML plug-in for the beta release of Netscape 2.0 by Netscape Communications.

In 1997, a new version of the format was finalized, as VRML97 (also known as VRML2 or VRML 2.0), and became an ISO/IEC standard. VRML97 was used on the Internet on some personal homepages and sites such as &quot;CyberTown&quot;, which offered 3D chat using Blaxxun Software, as well as Sony&#x27;s SAPARi program, which was pre-installed on Vaio computers from 1997 to 2001. The format was championed by SGI&#x27;s Cosmo Software; when SGI restructured in 1998, the division was sold to the VREAM Division of Platinum Technology, which was then taken over by Computer Associates, which did not develop or distribute the software. To fill the void a variety of proprietary Web 3D formats emerged over the next few years, including Microsoft Chrome and Adobe Atmosphere, neither of which is supported today. VRML&#x27;s capabilities remained largely the same while realtime 3D graphics kept improving. The VRML Consortium changed its name to the Web3D Consortium, and began work on the successor to VRML—X3D.

SGI ran a web site at vrml.sgi.com on which was hosted a string of regular short performances of a character called &quot;Floops&quot; who was a VRML character in a VRML world. Floops was a creation of a company called Protozoa.

H-Anim is a standard for animated Humanoids, which is based around VRML, and later X3D. The initial version 1.0 of the H-Anim standard was scheduled for submission at the end of March 1998.

VRML has never seen much serious widespread use. One reason for this may have been the lack of available bandwidth. At the time of VRML&#x27;s popularity, a majority of users, both business and personal, were using slow dial-up Internet access.

VRML experimentation was primarily in education and research where an open specification is most valued. It has now been re-engineered as X3D. The MPEG-4 Interactive Profile (ISO/IEC 14496) was based on VRML (now on X3D), and X3D is largely backward-compatible with it. VRML is also widely used as a file format for interchange of 3D models, particularly from CAD systems.

A free cross-platform runtime implementation of VRML is available in OpenVRML. Its libraries can be used to add both VRML and X3D support to applications, and a GTK+ plugin is available to render VRML/X3D worlds in web browsers.

In the 2000s, many companies like Bitmanagement improved the quality level of virtual effects in VRML to the quality level of DirectX 9.0c, but at the expense of using proprietary solutions. All main features like game modeling are already complete. They include multi-pass render with low level setting for Z-buffer, BlendOp, AlphaOp, Stencil, Multi-texture, Shader with HLSL and GLSL support, realtime Render To Texture, Multi Render Target (MRT) and PostProcessing. Many demos shows that VRML already supports lightmap, normalmap, SSAO, CSM and Realtime Environment Reflection along with other virtual effects.

== Example ==
This example shows the same scene as .

#VRML V2.0 utf8

 geometry IndexedFaceSet {
 coordIndex [ 0, 1, 2 ]
 coord Coordinate {
 point [ 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0.5, 1, 0 ]
 }


== Early criticism ==

In a March 1998 ACM essay, &quot;Playfulness in 3D Spaces -- Why Quake is better than VRML, and what it means for software design&quot;, Clay Shirky sharply criticised VRML as a &quot;technology in search of a problem&quot;, whereas &quot;Quake does something well instead of many things poorly...The VRML community has failed to come up with anything this compelling -- not despite the community&#x27;s best intentions, but because of them. Every time VRML practitioners approach the problem of how to represent space on the screen, they have no focused reason to make any particular trade-off of detail versus rendering speed, or making objects versus making spaces, because VRML isn&#x27;t for anything except itself. Many times, having a particular, near-term need to solve brings a project&#x27;s virtues into sharp focus, and gives it enough clarity to live on its own.&quot;

<doc id="101681" wikidata="Q333886" url="?curid=101681" title="Georgetown University">
<text>Georgetown University is a private Jesuit research university in Washington, D.C., United States. Founded by Bishop John Carroll in 1789, it is the oldest Catholic institution of higher education in the United States, the oldest university in Washington, D.C., and the nation&#x27;s first federally chartered university.

The university has eleven undergraduate and graduate schools. Its main campus, located in the Georgetown historic neighborhood, is on a hill above the Potomac River and identifiable by Healy Hall, a National Historic Landmark. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and its undergraduate admissions is considered selective. The university offers degree programs in forty-eight disciplines, enrolling an average of 7,500 undergraduate and 10,000 graduate students from more than 135 countries. The school&#x27;s athletic teams are nicknamed the Hoyas and include a men&#x27;s basketball team, which is a member of the Big East Conference. 

Notable alumni include 32 Rhodes Scholars, 46 Marshall Scholars, 33 Truman Scholars, 543 Fulbright Scholars, 9 living billionaires, 25 U.S. governors, 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices, 2 U.S. presidents, more than 450 members of United States Congress, as well as international royalty and more than a dozen foreign heads of state. Georgetown has educated more U.S. diplomats than any other university, as well as a number of American politicians and civil servants.

==History==
===Founding===

In 1634, Jesuit settlers from England founded the Province of Maryland in colonial-era British America. In 1646, the defeat of the Royalists in the English Civil War led to stringent laws against Catholic education and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including missionary Andrew White, and the destruction of their school at Calverton Manor. During most of the remainder of Maryland&#x27;s colonial period, Jesuits conducted Catholic schools clandestinely. Following the end of the American Revolutionary War, plans to establish a permanent Catholic institution for education in the United States were realized.

At Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s recommendation, Pope Pius VI appointed former Jesuit John Carroll the first head of the Catholic Church in the United States, even though the papal suppression of the Jesuit order was still in effect. Carroll began meetings of local clergy in 1783 near Annapolis, where they orchestrated the development of a new university. On January 23, 1789, Carroll finalized the purchase of the property in Georgetown on which Dahlgren Quadrangle was later built. Future Congressman William Gaston was enrolled as the school&#x27;s first student on November 22, 1791, and instruction began on January 2, 1792.

===19th century===
During its early years, Georgetown College suffered from considerable financial strain. The Maryland Society of Jesus began its restoration in 1805, and Jesuit affiliation, in the form of teachers and administrators, bolstered confidence in the college. The school relied on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local lands which had been donated to the Jesuits. To raise money for Georgetown and other schools in 1838, Maryland Jesuits conducted a mass sale of some 272 slaves to two Deep South plantations in Maringouin, Louisiana, from their six in Maryland, ending their slaveholding.

President James Madison signed into law Georgetown&#x27;s congressional charter on March 1, 1815, creating the first federal university charter, which allowed it to confer degrees, with the first bachelor&#x27;s degrees being awarded two years later. 

In 1844, the school received a corporate charter under the name &quot;The President and Directors of Georgetown College&quot;, affording the growing school additional legal rights. In response to the demand for a local option for Catholic students, the Medical School was founded in 1851.


The American Civil War greatly impacted Georgetown as 1,141 students and alumni enlisted in one army or the other, and the Union Army commandeered university buildings in order to defend the national capital from a feared a Confederate attack. By the time President Abraham Lincoln visited the Georgetown campus in May 1861, 1,400 troops were living in temporary quarters there. The number of lives lost in the Civil war caused enrollment levels to remain low until well after the war. Only seven students graduated in 1869, down from over 300 in the previous decade. When the Georgetown College Boat Club, the school&#x27;s rowing team, was founded in 1876 it adopted two colors: blue, used for Union uniforms, and gray, used for Confederate uniforms. These colors signified the peaceful existence of students who held various loyalties.

Enrollment did not recover until the late 19th century, during the presidency of Patrick Francis Healy from 1873 to 1881. Born in Athens, Georgia as a slave by law and mixed-race by ancestry, Healy was the first person of African descent to head a predominantly white American university. He identified as Irish Catholic, like his father, and was educated in Catholic schools in the United States and France. He is credited with reforming the undergraduate curriculum, lengthening the medical and law programs, and creating the Alumni Association. One of his largest undertakings was the construction of a major new building, subsequently named Healy Hall in his honor. For his work, Healy is known as the school&#x27;s &quot;second founder&quot;.

In 1870, after the founding of the Law Department, Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus on higher education. 

===20th century===
In 1901, the School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate School of Nursing in 1903. Georgetown Preparatory School relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the university in 1927. 

The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh to prepare students for leadership in diplomacy and foreign commerce. The School of Dentistry became independent of the School of Medicine in 1956. The School of Business Administration was separated from the SFS in 1957 and was renamed the McDonough School of Business (MSB) in 1998 in honor of SFS alumnus Robert E. McDonough.

Georgetown also aimed to expand its resources and student body. The School of Nursing has admitted female students since its founding, and most of the university classes were made available to women on a limited basis by 1952. With the College of Arts and Sciences welcoming its first female students in the 1969–1970 academic year, Georgetown became fully coeducational.

In 1962, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) was founded at Georgetown University as a think tank to conduct policy studies and strategic analyses of political, economic and security issues throughout the world. When Henry Kissinger retired from his position as U.S. Secretary of State in 1977, he taught at Georgetown SFS, making CSIS the base for his Washington operations. In 1986, the university&#x27;s board of directors voted to sever all ties with CSIS due to differences in academic direction and competing fund-raising efforts.

In 1975, Georgetown established the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, soliciting funds from the governments of the United States, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Libya as well as American corporations with business interests in the Middle East. It later returned the money it received from Muammar Qaddafi&#x27;s Libyan government, which had been used to fund a chair for Hisham Shirabi, and also returned further donations from Iraq. Georgetown ended its bicentennial year of 1989 by electing Leo J. O&#x27;Donovan, S.J. as president. He subsequently launched the Third Century Campaign to expand the school&#x27;s endowment.

===21st century===
In December 2003, Georgetown completed the campaign after raising over $1 billion for financial aid, academic chair endowment, and new capital projects.

In October 2002, Georgetown University began studying the feasibility of opening a campus of the SFS in Qatar, when the non-profit Qatar Foundation first proposed the idea. The School of Foreign Service in Qatar opened in 2005 along with four other U.S. universities in the Education City development. Additionally, the Center for International and Regional Studies (CIRS) opened in 2005 at the new Qatar campus. Between 2012 and 2018, Georgetown received more than $350 million from Gulf Cooperation Council countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.

In 2005, Georgetown received a $20 million gift from Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Alsaud, a member of the Saudi Royal Family; at that time the second-largest donation ever to the university, it was used to expand the activities of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. The same year, Georgetown began hosting a two-week workshop at Fudan University&#x27;s School of International Relations and Public Affairs in Shanghai, China, which developed into a more formal connection when Georgetown opened a liaison office at Fudan on January 12, 2008, to further collaboration.

John J. DeGioia, Georgetown&#x27;s first lay president, led the school from 2001 to 2024. DeGioia continued its financial modernization and sought to &quot;expand opportunities for intercultural and interreligious dialogue.&quot; DeGioia also founded the annual Building Bridges Seminar in 2001, which brings global religious leaders together, and is part of Georgetown&#x27;s effort to promote religious pluralism. The Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs began as an initiative in 2004, and after a grant from William R. Berkley, was launched as an independent organization in 2006. 

===Jesuit tradition===

Georgetown University was founded by former Jesuits in the tradition of Ignatius of Loyola; it is a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. Georgetown is not a pontifical university, though seven Jesuits serve on the 36 member Board of Directors, the university&#x27;s governing body. 

Catholic spaces at the university, including Dahlgren Chapel, the university&#x27;s principal place of Catholic worship, fall within the territorial jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Washington, 

Fifty-two members of the Society of Jesus live on campus, and are employed by Georgetown mostly as professors or administrators. Jesuit Heritage Week has been held every year since 2001 to celebrate the contributions of Jesuits to the Georgetown tradition.

Georgetown&#x27;s Catholic heritage has been controversial at times, even though its influence is relatively limited. Stores in university-owned buildings are prohibited from selling or distributing birth control products. 

The university hosts the Cardinal O&#x27;Connor Conference on Life annually in January to discuss the pro-life movement. Georgetown University Medical Center and Georgetown University Hospital, operated by MedStar Health, are prohibited from performing abortions. However, , the hospital was performing research using embryonic stem cells.

Between 1996 and 1999, the administration added crucifixes to many classroom walls, a change that attracted national attention. Before 1996, crucifixes had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms. Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such. 

In May 2004, Imam Yahya Hendi, the school&#x27;s on-campus Muslim cleric, faced pressure to remove crucifixes while he and other campus faith leaders defended their placement. The Edward B. Bunn, S.J. Intercultural Center rotates displays of various faith and culture symbols in its lobby.

In September 2005, Georgetown was criticized by religious groups, including the Cardinal Newman Society, for not following the teachings of the church and hosting pro-abortion rights speakers, including John Kerry and Barack Obama. 

In 2009, Georgetown&#x27;s religious symbols were brought back to national attention after the university administration covered-up the name of Jesus in preparation for then President Barack Obama&#x27;s speech on campus.

In May 2012, Washington&#x27;s Archbishop Donald Wuerl criticized the university for inviting pro-abortion rights Kathleen Sebelius to be a commencement speaker.

In August 2013, religious groups denounced Georgetown for allowing gay-themed events, including a performance, during which &quot;a male student went as a high-heeled Mary and danced to Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; while Jesus (a woman) looked on.&quot;

==Campuses==
Georgetown University has four campuses in Washington, D.C.: the undergraduate campus located in the neighborhood of Georgetown, the Medical Center, the School of Continuing Studies (in Chinatown) and the Law Center. The undergraduate campus and Medical Center are together in the Georgetown neighborhood in the Northwest Quadrant of Washington and form the main campus. Other centers are located around Washington, D.C., including the Center for Continuing and Professional Education at Clarendon in Arlington County, Virginia. Transit between these locations and the Washington Metro is supplied by a system of shuttles, known as GUTS buses. Georgetown also has branches of the School of Foreign Service in Doha, Qatar, and Jakarta, Indonesia, as well as villas in Alanya, Turkey, and Fiesole, Italy. In their campus layout, Georgetown&#x27;s administrators consistently used the traditional quadrangle design.

===Main campus===
Georgetown&#x27;s undergraduate and medical school campuses are situated on an elevated site above the Potomac River overlooking Northern Virginia. Because of this, Georgetown University is often referred to as &quot;The Hilltop&quot;. The main gates, known as the &quot;Healy Gates&quot;, are located at the intersection of 37th and O Streets NW, and lead directly to the heart of campus. The main campus is relatively compact, being in area, but includes fifty-four buildings, student residences and apartments capable of accommodating 80% of undergraduates, and various athletic facilities. Most buildings employ collegiate Gothic architecture and Georgian brick architecture. Campus green areas include fountains, a cemetery, large clusters of flowers, groves of trees, and open quadrangles. New buildings and major renovations are required to meet LEED Silver criteria, and the campus was nominated for the District Sustainability People&#x27;s Choice Award in 2018.

Healy Hall, designed by Paul J. Pelz in Neo-Medieval style and built from 1877 to 1879, is the architectural gem of Georgetown&#x27;s campus, and is a National Historic Landmark. Within Healy Hall are a number of notable rooms including Gaston Hall, Riggs Library, and the Bioethics Library Hirst Reading Room. Both Healy Hall and the Georgetown University Astronomical Observatory, built in 1844, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In addition to the front lawn, the main campus has traditionally centered on Dahlgren Quadrangle behind Healy Hall, which is home to Dahlgren Chapel; however, in recent decades, Red Square has replaced the Dahlgren Quadrangle as the focus of student life. North of Red Square is an extended pathway that is home to buildings such as the Intercultural Center (ICC), the Reiss Science building, the newly constructed dormitory named after Pedro Arrupe, and the large Leavey Student Center. 

The medical school is located in the northwestern part of the main campus on Reservoir Road. It is integrated with Georgetown University Hospital. 

In the 21st-century, the West side of the Hilltop has emerged as a newly developing area of the main campus. The university completed the Southwest Quadrangle Project in late 2003 and brought a new 907-bed upperclassmen residence hall, the Leo J. O&#x27;Donovan dining hall, a large underground parking facility, and a new Jesuit Residence to the campus. The school&#x27;s first performing arts center, named for Royden B. Davis, was completed in November 2005. The new business school headquarters, named for Rafik Hariri, opened in Fall 2009, and Regents Hall, the new science building, opened in Fall 2012. Along with the adjacent Leavey Student Center, these two large buildings have become popular study spaces and overlook a newly developed scenic lawn space. 

In the fall of 2014, the university opened a new student center, the Healey Family Student Center (HFSC) to complement the longstanding Leavey Center. The Healey Family Student Center is located on the first floor of New South Hall, a space that functioned as the university&#x27;s main dining facility until the Leo J. O&#x27;Donovan dining hall opening in 2003. It features over 43,000 square feet including several study spaces, conference rooms, dance, and music studios, as well as a pub called Bulldog Tavern and a salad store Hilltoss, which is operated by The Corp.

As a location, Georgetown was ranked nationally as the second-best college town by The Princeton Review in 2011. The Georgetown neighborhood west of Wisconsin Avenue NW is dominated by the presence of university students. Students have easy access to the M Street commercial area, the Georgetown Waterfront, and numerous trails that lead to the National Mall and other parks. Despite this, &quot;town and gown&quot; relations between the university communities and other Georgetown residents are often strained by facilities construction, enlargement of the student body, as well as noise and alcohol violations. Several groups of neighborhood residents have attempted to slow University growth in Georgetown, creating friction between students and the surrounding neighborhood. Despite the relative safety of the neighborhood, crime is a persistent issue, with campus security responding to 257 crimes in 2008, the majority of which were petty crimes.

===Law Center campus===
The Law Center campus is located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood on New Jersey Avenue, near Washington Union Station, and consists of five buildings. First-year students at the Law Center can live in the single on-campus dormitory, the Gewirz Student Center. Most second- and third-year students, as well as some first-year students, live off-campus. As there is little housing near the Law Center, most are spread throughout the Washington metropolitan area. 

The Campus Completion Project, finished in 2005, saw the addition of the Hotung International Building and the Sport and Fitness Center. G Street and F Street are closed off between 1st and 2nd Streets to create open lawns flanking McDonough Hall, the main building on the campus. In 2019, the university purchased $70 million of a building at 500 First St. NW to add to the Georgetown University Law Center. Opening in 2020, the 130,000-square-foot edifice will provide classrooms and offices for researchers in health, technology, law and other fields.

===Downtown campus===
The School of Continuing Studies (SCS) campus is located in a 95,000 square foot, state-of-the-art building in downtown Washington, D.C. The campus currently serves as the home for Georgetown&#x27;s graduate programs in fields such as Applied Intelligence, Journalism, Public Relations, Real Estate, Sports Industry Management, and Urban &amp; Regional Planning.

The current building, which was completed in 2013, includes 30 classrooms, a 125-person auditorium, a digital media lab, a broadcast studio, an interfaith chapel, and a dedicated library. It is located in the Chinatown neighborhood of the city and is considered to be one of the most accessible locations in town, with a Transit Score of 100 and a Walk Score of 98. It is also located just a few blocks away from the Capital One Arena, the home court of the men&#x27;s basketball team.

===Qatar campus===
In 2002, the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development presented the School of Foreign Service with the resources and space to open a campus in Education City in Al Rayyan, Qatar. SFS-Qatar opened in 2005 as a liberal arts and international affairs undergraduate school for regional students. It offers the same Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (BSFS) as the main campus, in addition to three certificates. Apart from language courses, including Arabic and French, all courses are taught in English and the curriculum and course materials in the specified majors are identical to those offered at Georgetown&#x27;s main campus in Washington D.C.

===Facilities abroad===

In December 1979, the Marquesa Margaret Rockefeller de Larrain, granddaughter of John D. Rockefeller, gave the Villa Le Balze to Georgetown University. The Villa is in Fiesole, Italy, on a hill above the city of Florence. The Villa is used year-round for study abroad programs focused on specialized interdisciplinary study of Italian culture and civilization. 

The main facility for the McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies was donated to Georgetown in 1989 by alumnus and former United States Ambassador to Turkey George C. McGhee. The school is in the town of Alanya, Turkey within the Seljuq-era Alanya Castle, on the Mediterranean. The center operates study abroad programs one semester each year, concentrating on Turkish language, architectural history, and Islamic studies.

In December 2007, Georgetown opened a liaison office in Shanghai, China to coordinate with Fudan University and others. In 2008, the Georgetown University Law Center in conjunction with an international consortium of law schools established the Center for Transnational Legal Studies in London, England. 

In November 2023, Indonesian President Joko Widodo announced Georgetown plans to open a satellite campus of the School of Foreign Service in Jakarta that will offer degree programs for present and future policymakers in the United States and Southeast Asia. The campus, known as Georgetown SFS Asia-Pacific (GSAP), was launched in January 2025.

WGTB, Georgetown&#x27;s radio station, is available as a webcast and on 92.3 FM in certain dormitories. The station was founded in 1946, and broadcast on 90.1 FM from 1960 to 1979, when university president Timothy S. Healy gave away the frequency and broadcast capabilities to the University of the District of Columbia because of WGTB&#x27;s far left political orientation. The station now broadcasts through the Internet in its headquarters in the Leavey Center.

===Greek life===
Many Jesuit schools choose to disassociate from Greek systems, and Georgetown University officially recognizes and funds only one of the many Greek organizations on campus, Alpha Phi Omega, the national co-ed community service fraternity. Other Greek organizations exist on campus, although none require members to live in Greek housing. Additionally, Georgetown University students are affiliated, in some cases, with fraternities at other nearby universities and colleges.

About 10 percent of undergraduate students participate in Greek life, a ratio lower than at many other colleges and universities.

===Traditions===

Annual events on campus celebrate Georgetown traditions, culture, alumni, sports, and politics. In late April, Georgetown University celebrates Georgetown Day.

Homecoming coincides with a home football game, and festivities such as tailgating and a formal dance are sponsored by the Alumni Association to draw past graduates back to campus. The largest planned sports related celebration is the first basketball practice of the season. Dubbed &quot;Midnight Madness&quot;, this event introduces the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams shortly after midnight on the first day the teams are allowed by NCAA rules to formally practice together. The festivities include a dunk contest, a 3-point contest, a scrimmage, and a musical act.

==Athletics==
Georgetown fields 23 varsity athletic teams and an additional 23 athletic club teams. The university&#x27;s varsity teams participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I. The school competes in the Big East Conference in most sports. Exceptions include the football team, which competes in Division I FCS&#x27; Patriot League, the sailing team, which competes in the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association, and the rowing teams, which competes in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges.

In March 2002, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; listed Georgetown&#x27;s athletics program among the 20 best in the nation. Georgetown&#x27;s student athletes have a 94% graduation success rate, and over 100 have gone on to play at some level of professional athletics.

The school&#x27;s teams are called &quot;Hoyas&quot;, which originated sometime prior to 1893, when students invented the mixed Greek and Latin chant of &quot;Hoya Saxa&quot;, translating roughly as &quot;what (or such) rocks&quot;. The school&#x27;s baseball team, then called the Stonewalls, began in 1870, and football began in 1874; the chant likely refers to one of these teams. By the 1920s, the term &quot;Hoyas&quot; was used to describe groups on campus, and by 1928, campus sports writers started using it instead of the older team name, the &quot;Hilltoppers&quot;.

The men&#x27;s basketball team, which won the NCAA championship in 1984 under coach John Thompson, is among the university&#x27;s most successful athletic programs. The team holds the record for the most Big East conference tournament titles with eight, and has made thirty NCAA tournament appearances. Georgetown&#x27;s NBA alumni are collectively among the highest earners from a single program.

The sailing team has won 14 national championships and one world championship in match racing since 2001. Over this time, the sailing team has graduated 79 All-Americans and six College Sailors of the year.

The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse teams have both been ranked in the top ten nationally, as have both soccer teams, with the men winning Georgetown&#x27;s third team national championship in 2019, and the women making the national quarterfinals in 2010 and the semifinals in 2016. 

The rugby club team made it to the Division II Final Four in 2005 and 2009. In 2019, Georgetown won the women&#x27;s team championship at the United States Intercollegiate Boxing Association national tournament held at Syracuse University.

Former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon &quot;Gordie&quot; Ernst, one of several people implicated in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal, is alleged to have facilitated the admission to Georgetown of as many as 12 students through fraudulent means while accepting bribes of up to $950,000. Ernst had relocated to the University of Rhode Island, where he was placed on administrative leave after he was charged and arrested. He later pled guilty to conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery, three counts of federal programs bribery, and to filing false tax returns for failing to report many of the bribery payments.

=== Government and politics ===
Government and international relations are the top two most popular undergraduate majors across every college at Georgetown, and many students go on to careers in politics. Former President of the United States Bill Clinton is a 1968 graduate of the School of Foreign Service. Georgetown educated more U.S. diplomats than any other university as of 2015, including former U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig and Director General of the Foreign Service Marcia Bernicat. Georgetown alumni have served as foreign ministers in a dozen of countries.

In the 119th U.S. Congress, seven alumni serve in the United States Senate and 21 are in the House of Representatives. Current congressional alumni include Hakeem Jeffries, House minority leader, John Barrasso, Senate majority whip, and Dick Durbin, Senate minority whip. Twenty-five alumni have served as U.S. state governors, including Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Pat Quinn of Illinois. On the U.S. Supreme Court, alumni include the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia and former Chief Justice Edward Douglass White. Hoya Battalion, the school&#x27;s ROTC program, was ranked as the best in the country in 2012 for preparing cadets for military service, and Georgetown graduates have gone on to hold leadership roles in defense and national security at both the domestic and international level, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. John J. Sheehan.

=== Finance and economics ===
Finance and economics are the third and fourth-most popular undergraduate majors, and almost a quarter of graduates start careers at consulting or financial services firms. Georgetown is considered one of Wall Street&#x27;s top target schools, so a large number of graduates choose to work in investment banks, consulting firms, and hedge funds. The university is among the top ten alma maters reported by current Wall Street banking employees , according to LinkedIn surveys. Citigroup was the most commonly reported employer, and their former CEO Charles Prince is a graduate of the Law School. Many graduates of the SFS pursued careers in multilateral and international financial institutions, and former World Bank president David Malpass attended the school. Many graduates went on to take research and leadership positions in many monetary authorities across the world, and current Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell is a 1979 graduate of Georgetown Law. Five undergraduate alumni own professional sports teams, making Georgetown the most popular undergraduate university for major North American sports franchise owners. 

=== Media ===
Georgetown alumni in media, including &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Walter Pincus and NPR correspondent Lulu Garcia-Navarro, have been awarded the Pulitzer Prize, Edward R. Murrow Award, and Peabody Awards.

<text>Celluloids are a class of materials produced by mixing nitrocellulose and camphor, often with added dyes and other agents. Once much more common for its use as photographic film before the advent of safer methods, celluloid&#x27;s common present-day uses are for manufacturing table tennis balls, musical instruments, combs, office equipment, fountain pen bodies, and guitar picks.

==History==

===Nitrocellulose===
Nitrocellulose-based plastics slightly predate celluloid. Collodion, invented in 1848 and used as a wound dressing and an emulsion for photographic plates, is dried to a celluloid like film.

===Alexander Parkes===
The first celluloid as a bulk material for forming objects was made in 1855 in Birmingham, England, by Alexander Parkes, who was never able to see his invention reach full fruition, after his firm went bankrupt due to scale-up costs. Parkes patented his discovery as Parkesine in 1862 after realising a solid residue remained after evaporation of the solvent from photographic collodion.

Parkes patented it as a clothing waterproofer for woven fabrics in the same year. Later Parkes showcased Parkesine at the 1862 International Exhibition in London, where he was awarded a bronze medal for his efforts. The introduction of Parkesine is generally regarded as the birth of the plastics industry. Parkesine was made from cellulose treated with nitric acid and a solvent. The Parkesine company ceased trading in 1868. Pictures of Parkesine are held by the Plastics Historical Society of London. There is a plaque on the wall of the site of the Parkesine Works in Hackney, London.

===John Wesley Hyatt===
In the 1860s, an American, John Wesley Hyatt, acquired Parkes&#x27;s patent and began experimenting with cellulose nitrate with the intention of manufacturing billiard balls, which until that time were made from ivory. He used cloth, ivory dust, and shellac, and on April 6, 1869, patented a method of covering billiard balls with the addition of collodion. With assistance from Peter Kinnear and other investors, Hyatt formed the Albany Billiard Ball Company (1868–1986) in Albany, New York, to manufacture the product. In 1870, John and his brother Isaiah patented a process of making a &quot;horn-like material&quot; with the inclusion of cellulose nitrate and camphor. Alexander Parkes and Daniel Spill &quot;(see below)&quot; listed camphor during their earlier experiments, calling the resultant mix &quot;xylonite&quot;, but it was the Hyatt brothers who recognized the value of camphor and its use as a plasticizer for cellulose nitrate. They used heat and pressure to simplify the manufacture of these compounds. Isaiah Hyatt dubbed the material &quot;celluloid&quot; in 1872. The Hyatts later moved their company, now called the Celluloid Manufacturing Company, to Newark, New Jersey. 
Over the years, celluloid became the common use term used for this type of plastic. In 1878 Hyatt was able to patent a process for injection moulding thermoplastics, although it took another fifty years before it could be realized commercially, and in later years celluloid was used as the base for photographic film.

=== Imitating ivory ===
The development of celluloid was partially spurred by the desire to reduce reliance on ivory, with its shortages caused by overhunting. An 1883 invention allowed celluloid manufacturers to imitate the distinctive graining of ivory, and by the end of 19th century celluloid was marketed as a lighter (and three times cheaper) ivory substitute under the names &quot;Ivarine&quot;, &quot;Ivaleur&quot;, &quot;French Ivory&quot;, &quot;Parisian Ivory&quot;, &quot;Grained Ivory&quot;, and &quot;Ivory Pyralin&quot;.

===Daniel Spill and legal disputes===
English inventor Daniel Spill had worked with Parkes and formed the Xylonite Co. to take over Parkes&#x27; patents, describing the new plastic products as &quot;Xylonite&quot;. He took exception to the Hyatts&#x27; claims and pursued the brothers in a number of court cases between 1877 and 1884. Initially the judge found in Spill&#x27;s favor, but ultimately it was judged that neither party held an exclusive claim and the true inventor of celluloid/xylonite was Alexander Parkes, due to his mention of camphor in his earlier experiments and patents. The judge ruled all manufacturing of celluloid could continue both in Spill&#x27;s British Xylonite Company and Hyatt&#x27;s&#x27; Celluloid Manufacturing Company.
The main use was in movie and photography film industries, which used only celluloid film stock prior to the adoption of acetate safety film in the 1950s. Celluloid is highly flammable, difficult and expensive to produce and no longer widely used.

==Photography==

English photographer John Carbutt founded the Keystone Dry Plate Works in 1879 with the intention of producing gelatin dry plates. The Celluloid Manufacturing Company was contracted for this work, which was done by thinly slicing layers out of celluloid blocks and then removing the slice marks with heated pressure plates. After this, the celluloid strips were coated with a photosensitive gelatin emulsion. It is not certain exactly how long it took for Carbutt to standardize his process, but it occurred no later than 1888. A sheet of Carbutt&#x27;s film was used by William Dickson for the early Edison motion picture experiments on a cylinder drum Kinetograph. However, the celluloid film base produced by this means was still considered too stiff for the needs of motion-picture photography.

By 1889, more flexible celluloids for photographic film were developed, and both Hannibal Goodwin and the Eastman Kodak Company obtained patents for a film product. (Ansco, which purchased Goodwin&#x27;s patent after he died, was eventually successful in a patent-infringement suit against Kodak). This ability to produce photographic images on a flexible material (as opposed to a glass or metal plate) was a crucial step toward making possible the advent of motion pictures.

==Uses==


Most movie and photography films prior to the widespread move to acetate films in the 1950s were made of celluloid. Its high flammability was legendary since it self-ignites when exposed to temperatures over 150 °C in front of a hot movie-projector beam. While celluloid film was standard for 35mm theatrical productions until around 1950, motion-picture film for amateur use, such as 16mm and 8mm film, were on acetate &quot;safety base&quot;, at least in the US.

Celluloid was useful for producing cheaper jewellery, jewellery boxes, hair accessories and many items that would earlier have been manufactured from ivory, horn or other expensive animal products. In these applications it was often referred to as &quot;Ivorine&quot; or &quot;French Ivory&quot;, after a form of celluloid developed in France with grain lines in made to resemble ivory. It was also used for dressing table sets, dolls, picture frames, charms, hat pins, buttons, buckles, stringed instrument parts, accordions, fountain pens, cutlery handles and kitchen items. The main disadvantage the material had was that it was flammable. It was soon overtaken by Bakelite and Catalin. Soviet roly-poly dolls were made from celluloid on smokeless powder plants until 1996, and table tennis balls – until 2014. &quot;Parker Brothers... made some versions out of hollow Celluloid--which, because of its &#x27;frictionless&#x27; properties, spun even faster than steel.&quot;

Shelf clocks and other furniture items were often covered with celluloid in a manner similar to veneer. This celluloid was printed to look like expensive woods, or materials like marble or granite. The Seth Thomas clock company bought rights for its use as a durable coating from Celluloid Manufacturing Company in September, 1880 and marketed it as, &quot;Adamantine&quot;. Celluloid enabled clockmakers to make the typical late Victorian style of black mantel clock in such a way that the wooden case appeared to be black marble, and the various pillars and other decorative elements of the case looked like semi-precious stone.

Celluloid was also a popular material in the construction of slide rules. It was primarily used to coat wooden slide rule faces, such as in early A.W. Faber rules, as well as cursor end pieces, such as in Keuffel and Esser rules.

Celluloid remains in use for musical instruments, especially accordions and guitars. Celluloid is very robust and easy to mold in difficult forms, and has great acoustic performance as cover for wooden frames since it does not block wood&#x27;s natural pores. Instruments covered with celluloid can easily be recognized by the material&#x27;s typical nacre-like flaming pattern. Thick celluloid panels are cooked in a bain-marie which turns them into a leather-like substance. Panels are then turned on a mold and allowed to harden for as long as three months.

==Formulation==
A typical formulation of celluloid might contain 70 to 80 parts nitrocellulose, nitrated to 11% nitrogen, 30 parts camphor, 0 to 14 parts dye, 1 to 5 parts ethyl alcohol, plus stabilizers and other agents to increase stability and reduce flammability.

==Production==

Celluloid is made from a mixture of chemicals such as nitrocellulose, camphor, alcohol, as well as colorants and fillers depending on the desired product. The first step is transforming raw cellulose into nitrocellulose by conducting a nitration reaction. This is achieved by exposing the cellulose fibers to an aqueous solution of nitric acid; the hydroxyl groups (-OH) will then be replaced with nitrate groups (-ONO2) on the cellulose chain. The reaction can produce mixed products, depending on the degree of substitution of nitrogen, or the percent nitrogen content on each cellulose molecule; cellulose nitrate has 2.8 molecule of nitrogen per molecule of cellulose. It was determined that sulfuric acid was to be used as well in the reaction in order to first, catalyze the nitric acid groups so it can allow for the substitution onto the cellulose, and second, allow for the groups to easily and uniformly attach to the fibers, creating a better quality nitrocellulose. The product then must be rinsed to wash away any free acids that did not react with the fibers, dried, and kneaded. During this time, a solution of 50% camphor in alcohol is added, which then changes the macromolecule structure of nitrocellulose into a homogeneous gel of nitrocellulose and camphor. The chemical structure is not well understood, but it is determined that it is one molecule of camphor for each unit of glucose. After the mixing, the mass is pressed into blocks at a high pressure and then is fabricated for its specific use.

Nitrating cellulose is an extremely flammable process in which even factory explosions are not uncommon. Many western celluloid factories closed after hazardous explosions, and only two factories in China remain in business.

==Environmental hazards==

===Deterioration===

Many sources of deterioration in celluloid exist, such as thermal, chemical, photochemical, and physical. The most inherent flaw is as celluloid ages, the camphor molecules are ‘squeezed’ out of the mass due to the unsustainable pressure used in the production. That pressure causes the nitrocellulose molecules to bind back to each other or crystallize, and this results in the camphor molecules being shoved out of the material. Once exposed to the environment, camphor can undergo sublimation at room temperature, and the plastic reverts to brittle nitrocellulose. Also, with exposure to excess heat, the nitrate groups can break off and expose nitrogen gases, such as nitrous oxide and nitric oxide, to the air.

Another factor that can cause this is excess moisture, which can accelerate deterioration of nitrocellulose with the presence of nitrate groups, either newly fragmented from heat or still trapped as a free acid from production. Both of these sources allow the accumulation of nitric acid. Another form of deterioration, photochemical deterioration, is severe in celluloid because it absorbs ultraviolet light well. The absorbed light leads to chain-breakage and stiffening.

Among collectors of antiques, the deterioration of celluloid is generally known as &quot;celluloid rot.&quot; The chemical processes involved are not perfectly understood, but it is widely believed that the gases released by a piece undergoing celluloid rot can trigger celluloid rot in nearby articles of celluloid which were previously intact.

<doc id="101694" wikidata="Q902137" url="?curid=101694" title="Anne Hathaway's Cottage">
<text>Anne Hathaway&#x27;s Cottage is a twelve-roomed farmhouse where Anne Hathaway, the wife of William Shakespeare, lived as a child in the village of Shottery, Warwickshire, England, about west of Stratford-upon-Avon. Spacious, and with several bedrooms, it is now set in extensive gardens.

==History==
The earliest part of the house dates to 1463, when it was still a three-roomed building with only one floor; the higher part is 17th century, being built between April 1610 and October 1624. The house was known as Hewlands Farm in Shakespeare&#x27;s day and had more than of land attached to it; to call it a cottage is arguably a misnomer, as it is much larger than the term usually implies. As in many houses of the period, it has multiple chimneys to spread the heat evenly throughout the house during winter. The largest chimney was used for cooking. It also has visible timber framing, typical of vernacular Tudor architecture. 

The Hathaway family moved there in 1542, with John Hathaway, grandfather of Anne Hathaway, being the first Hathaway to live there.

After the death of Richard Hathaway (father of Anne Hathaway) in 1581, the cottage was owned by Anne Hathaway&#x27;s brother Bartholomew, who began to expand the building starting on 1 April 1610 and continuing until his death on 28 October 1624, and was passed down the Hathaway family until 1846, when financial problems, which began in 1700, forced them to sell it. However, it was still occupied by them as tenants when it was acquired in 1892 by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which removed later additions and alterations; William Baker was the last to live in the property and he left when his mother Mary Baker died in 1911. 

In 1969 the cottage was badly damaged in a fire, but was restored by the Trust. It is now open to the public as a museum.

==Gardens==
In 1920, horticulturist Ellen Willmott was commissioned by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust to advise on design and planting in the garden around the cottage, following the introduction of a large sewer which destroyed the previous garden. Her designs for the flower garden and orchard were intended to complement the buildings. Many of the plants chosen were mentioned in Shakespeare’s plays, with pastel combination in borders that remain colourful throughout the year. Much of her layout and plant choices are in place today, including the three flower beds near the cottage entrance, named Miss Willmott’s garden.

==Replicas==

Full-size replicas of Anne Hathaway&#x27;s cottage have been built around the world:

*Elizabethan Village, Bedfordale, Western Australia, Australia 
*English Inn, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada
*Grove Park Inn, Asheville, North Carolina, United States
*Odessa College, Texas, United States
*Staunton, Virginia, United States
