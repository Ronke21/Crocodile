<text>Pietro Carnesecchi (24 December 1508 – 1 October 1567) was an Italian humanist.

==Biography==
Born in Florence, he was the son of a da Andrea Carnesecchi, a merchant who under the patronage of the Medici, and especially of Giulio de&#x27; Medici as Pope Clement VII, rapidly rose to high office at the papal court.

He came into touch with the new learning at the house of his maternal uncle, Cardinal Bernardo Dovizi, in Rome. At the age of twenty-five he held several rich livings, had been notary and protonotary to the Curia and was first secretary to the pope, in which capacity he conducted the correspondence with the nuncios (among them Pier Paolo Vergerio in Germany) and a host of other duties.

By his conduct at the conference with Francis I of France at Marseille he won the favour of Catherine de&#x27; Medici and other influential personages at the French court, who in later days befriended him. He made the acquaintance of the Spanish reformer Juan de Valdés at Rome, and got to know him as a theologian at Naples, being especially drawn to him through the appreciation expressed by Bernardino Ochino, and through their mutual friendship with the Lady Giulia Gonzaga, whose spiritual adviser he became after the death of Valdés. He became a leading spirit in the literary and religious circle that gathered round Valdés in Naples, and that aimed at effecting from within the spiritual reformation of the church. Under Valdés&#x27; influence he wholeheartedly accepted Luther&#x27;s doctrine of justification by faith, though he repudiated a policy of schism.

He was also an intimate friend of the poet Vittoria Colonna, whom he met in Fondi in 1535.

When the movement of suppression began, Carnesecchi was implicated. For a time he found shelter with his friends in Paris, and from 1552 he was in Venice leading the party of reform in that city. In 1557 he was cited (for the second time) before the tribunal in Rome, but refused to appear. The death of Pope Paul IV and the accession of Pope Pius IV in 1559 made his position easier, and he came to live in Rome. With the accession of Pope Pius V in 1566 the Inquisition renewed its activities with fiercer zeal than ever.

Carnesecchi was in Venice when the news reached him, and betook himself to Florence, where, thinking himself safe, he was betrayed by Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, who wished to curry favour with the pope. From July 1566 he lay in prison over a year. On 21 September 1567 a sentence of degradation and death was passed on him and sixteen others, ambassadors from Florence vainly kneeling to the pope for some mitigation, and on 1 October he was publicly beheaded and then burned.

<text>The SM-65 Atlas was the first operational intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) developed by the United States and the first member of the Atlas rocket family. It was built for the U.S. Air Force by the Convair Division of General Dynamics at an assembly plant located in Kearny Mesa, San Diego.

Development dates to 1946, but over the next few years the project underwent several cancellations and re-starts. The deepening of the Cold War and intelligence showing the Soviet Union was working on an ICBM design led to it becoming a crash project in late 1952, along with the creation of several other missile projects to ensure one would enter service as soon as possible. The first test launch was carried out in June 1957, which failed. The first success of the Soviet R-7 Semyorka in August gave the program new urgency, leading to the first successful Atlas A launch in December. Of the eight flights of the A model, only three were successful, but the later models demonstrated increasing reliability and the D model was cleared for use.

Atlas C was declared operational in September 1959. Even at that time it was considered less than ideal as it had to be fuelled immediately before launch and thus had very slow reaction times. The Air Force still saw its strategic bombers as its primary force and considered Atlas as a last-ditch weapon that would ensure a counterattack in the case the Soviets attempted a sneak attack on the US bomber bases. The initial versions were stored at ground level and thus subject to attack by Soviet bombers, which greatly reduced their suitability for this role. Starting with the F models they were stored in underground silos that offered some protection from air attack. New designs, especially the Minuteman, rendered Atlas obsolete and it was retired from the ICBM role by 1965.

These disadvantages had no bearing on its use for space launches, and Atlas-derived launch vehicles served a long history as launchers. Even before its ICBM use ended in 1965, Atlas had placed four Project Mercury astronauts in orbit and was becoming the foundation for a family of successful space launch vehicles, most notably Atlas Agena and Atlas Centaur. Mergers led to the acquisition of the Atlas Centaur line by the United Launch Alliance. Today ULA supports the larger Atlas V, which combines the Centaur upper stage with a new booster. Until 1995, many retired Atlas ICBMs were refurbished and combined with upper stages to launch satellites.

==History==

Atlas was the first US ICBM and one of the first large liquid-fueled rockets. As such, its early development was quite chaotic, with plans changing rapidly as flight tests revealed issues.

Atlas began in 1946 with the award of an Army Air Forces research contract to Convair for the study of a range missile that might at some future date carry a nuclear warhead. This MX-774 project was named for the Atlas of Greek mythology and the contractor&#x27;s parent Atlas Corporation. At the time, the smallest atomic warheads were all larger than the maximum theoretical payloads of the planned long range missiles, so the contract was canceled in 1947, but the Army Air Forces allowed Convair to launch the three almost-completed research vehicles using the remaining contract funds. The three flights were only partially successful, but did show that balloon tanks and gimbaled rocket engines were valid concepts.

A second development contract was awarded to Convair on 23 January 1951 for what was then called MX-1593, with a relatively low priority. The initial design completed by Convair in 1953 was larger than the missile that eventually entered service. Estimated warhead weight was lowered from to based on highly favorable U.S. nuclear warhead tests in early 1954. This, in addition to the Soviet Union&#x27;s 1953 Joe 4 dry fuel thermonuclear weapon test and the CIA learning that the Soviet ICBM program was making progress, led to the project being dramatically accelerated. Project Atlas was assigned the highest Air Force development priority on 14 May 1954 by General Thomas D. White.

A major development and test contract was awarded to Convair on 14 January 1955 for a diameter missile to weigh about . Atlas development was tightly controlled by the Air Force&#x27;s Western Development Division, WDD, later part of the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division. Contracts for warhead, guidance and propulsion were handled separately by WDD. The first successful flight of a highly instrumented Atlas missile to full range occurred 28 November 1958. Atlas ICBMs were deployed operationally from 31 October 1959 to 12 April 1965.

The missile was originally designated as the XB-65 experimental bomber; in 1955 it was redesignated SM-65 (&quot;Strategic Missile 65&quot;) and, from 1962, it became CGM-16. This letter &quot;C&quot; stood for &quot;coffin&quot; or &quot;Container&quot;, the rocket being stored in a semi-hardened container; it was prepared for launch by being raised and fueled in the open. The Atlas-F (HGM-16) was stored vertically underground, but launched after being lifted to the surface.

By 1965, with the second-generation Titan II having reached operational status, the Atlas was obsolete as a missile system and had been phased out of military use. Many of the retired Atlas D, E, and F missiles were used for space launches into the 1990s.

The penetrating lubricant WD-40 found its first use as a corrosion-inhibiting coating for the outer skin of the Atlas missile.

==Missile details==

The Atlas&#x27;s complicated, unconventional design proved difficult to debug compared with rocket families such as Thor and Titan which used conventional aircraft-style structures and two stage setups and there were dozens of failed launches during the early years. After watching Atlas Serial 7D explode shortly after its nighttime launch, Mercury astronaut Gus Grissom remarked &quot;Are we really going to get on top of one of those things?&quot; The numerous failures led to Atlas being dubbed an &quot;Inter County Ballistic Missile&quot; by missile technicians, but by 1965 most of the problems had been worked out and it was a reliable launch vehicle. Nearly every component in the Atlas managed to fail at some point during test flights, from the engine combustion chambers to the tank pressurization system to the flight control system, but Convair engineers noted with some pride that there had never been a repeat of the same failure more than three times, and every component malfunction on an Atlas flight was figured out and resolved. Some of the repeat failures were also the result of rushed launch schedules and could have been avoided. The last major design hurdle to overcome was unstable engine thrust, which caused three Atlas missiles (Serial 51D and 48D in 1960 and Serial 27E in 1961) to explode on their launching stands.

===Pressure stabilized tanks===
Atlas was unusual in its use of balloon tanks for the propellants, made of very thin stainless steel with minimal or no rigid support structures, as already pioneered by the Soviet R-5 first launched in 1953. Pressure in the tanks provides the structural rigidity required for flight. An Atlas rocket would collapse under its own weight if not kept pressurized, and had to have nitrogen in the tank even when not fueled. The rocket had two small thrust chambers on the sides of the tank called vernier rockets. These provided fine adjustment of velocity and steering after the sustainer engine shut down.

===&#x27;Stage-and-a-half&#x27;===
Atlas was informally classified as a &quot;stage-and-a-half&quot; rocket, with a central sustainer engine and set of two booster engines that were all started at launch, each drawing from a single set of propellant tanks. Most multistage rockets drop both engines and fuel tanks simultaneously before firing the next stage&#x27;s engines. However, when the Atlas missile was being developed, there was doubt as to whether a rocket engine could be air-started. Therefore, the decision was made to ignite all of the Atlas&#x27; engines at launch; the booster engines would be discarded, while the sustainer continued to burn. A stage of a liquid propellant rocket normally consists of both propellant tanks and engines, so jettisoning one or more engines only is equivalent to &quot;half a stage&quot;. At staging, the booster engines would be shut off and a series of mechanical and hydraulic mechanisms would close the plumbing lines to them. The booster section would then be released by a series of hydraulic clamps (aside from the early test model Atlas B, which used explosive bolts) and slide off the missile on two tracks. From there on, the sustainer and verniers would operate by themselves. Booster staging took place at roughly two minutes into launch, although the exact timing could vary considerably depending on the model of Atlas as well as the particular mission being flown. This &quot;stage-and-a-half&quot; design was made possible by the extremely light weight balloon tanks. The tanks made up such a small percentage of the total booster weight that the mass penalty of lifting them to orbit was less than the technical and mass penalty required to throw half of them away mid-flight. However, technology advanced quickly and not long after design work on Atlas was completed, Convair rival Martin proposed a solution to the air-starting problem. Their Titan I missile, developed as an Atlas backup, had a conventional two stage design.

===Engines===
The booster engine consisted of two large thrust chambers. The Atlas A/B/C/D had a single turbopump assembly and gas generator driving both booster engines; the A/B/C had an interim engine with lower thrust while the D-series had the full-up engines delivering 303,000 pounds of thrust. On the Atlas E/F, each booster engine had a separate pump and gas generator. Later space launcher variants of the Atlas used the MA-5 propulsion system with twin turbopumps on each booster engine, driven by a common gas generator. The boosters were more powerful than the sustainer engine and did most of the lifting for the first two minutes of flight. In addition to pitch and yaw control, they could also perform roll control in the event of a vernier failure. The sustainer engine on all Atlas variants consisted of a single thrust chamber with its own turbopump and gas generator, which also powered two small pressure-fed vernier engines. The verniers provided roll control and final velocity trim. The total sea level thrust of all five thrust chambers was 360,000 lb&quot;f&quot; (1,600 kN) for a standard Atlas D. Atlas E/F had 375,000 pounds of thrust. Total sea level thrust for these three-engine Atlas Es and Fs was 389,000 lbf (1,730 kN). Launcher variants of the Atlas often had performance enhancements to the engines.

===Guidance===
The Atlas missiles A through D used radio guidance: the missile sent information from its inertial system to a ground station by radio, and received course correction information in return. The Atlas E and F had completely autonomous inertial guidance systems.

The ground based guidance computer was a key part of the missile system, until guidance computers were miniaturized enough to be installed inside the missile. Isaac L. Auerbach designed the Burroughs guidance computer for the Atlas ICBM missiles. The Burroughs guidance computer was one of the first transistor computers. It processed 24-bit data using 18-bit instructions. A total of 17 of these ground computers were delivered. These same ground computers was later used for Atlas-Able, Project Mercury, and other early spacecraft.

===Warhead===
The warhead of the Atlas D was originally the G.E. Mk 2 &quot;heat sink&quot; re-entry vehicle (RV) with a W49 thermonuclear weapon, combined weight and yield of 1.44 megatons (Mt). The W49 was later placed in a Mk 3 ablative RV, combined weight . The Atlas E and F had an AVCO Mk 4 RV containing a W38 thermonuclear warhead with a yield of 3.75 Mt which was fuzed for either air burst or contact burst. The Mk 4 RV also deployed penetration aids in the form of mylar balloons which replicated the radar signature of the Mk 4 RV. The Mk 4 plus W-38 had a combined weight of . All of the warheads deployed in the Atlas were over 100 times more powerful than the bomb dropped over Nagasaki in 1945.

===Comparison with R-7===
The R-7 Semyorka was the first Soviet ICBM and similarly started all engines before launch to avoid igniting a large liquid fuel engine at high altitudes. However, the R-7 had a central sustainer section, with four boosters attached to its sides. The large side boosters required use of an expensive launch pad and prevented launching the rocket from a silo. Like the Atlas, the use of cryogenic liquid oxygen meant that the missile could not be kept in the state of flight readiness indefinitely and was largely useless for its intended purpose (military) and was similarly developed into a space launch vehicle, initially delivering Sputnik and Vostok into orbit. The Soyuz rocket is descended from the R-7 and remains in use today.

==Missile versions==
===SM-65A Atlas===
The Convair X-11/SM-65A Atlas/Atlas A was the first full-scale prototype of the Atlas missile, first flying on 11 June 1957. It was a test model designed to verify the structure and propulsion system, and had no sustainer engine or separable stages. The first three Atlas A launches used an early Rocketdyne engine design with conical thrust chambers and only 135,000 pounds of thrust. By the fourth Atlas test, they were replaced by an improved engine design that had bell-shaped thrust chambers and 150,000 pounds of thrust.

There were eight Atlas A test flights, conducted in 1957–58, of which four were successful. All were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at either Launch Complex 12 or Launch Complex 14.

===SM-65B Atlas===
The Convair X-12/SM-65B was the second prototype version, introducing the stage and a half system that was a hallmark of the Atlas rocket program. This version was the first American rocket to achieve a flight distance that could be considered intercontinental when it flew .

The Atlas B was first flown on 19 July 1958. Of ten total flights, nine were sub-orbital test flights of the Atlas as an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, with five successful missions and four failures; the other flight placed the SCORE satellite into orbit. All launches were conducted from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at Launch Complexes 11, 13 and 14.

=== SM-65C Atlas ===
The SM-65C Atlas, or Atlas C was the third prototype Atlas version, a more refined model with improved, lighter-weight components. a bigger LOX tank, and a smaller fuel tank. First flown on 24 December 1958, it was the final development version. It was originally planned to be used as the first stage of the Atlas-Able rocket, but following an explosion during a static test on 24 September 1959, this was abandoned in favor of the Atlas D. Six flights were made, all sub-orbital ballistic test flights of the Atlas, with three tests succeeding, and three failing. All launches were conducted from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at Launch Complex 12.

=== SM-65D Atlas ===
The SM-65D Atlas, or Atlas D, was the first operational version of the Atlas missile and the basis for all Atlas space launchers, debuting in 1959. Atlas D weighed (without payload) and had an empty weight of only ; the other 95.35% was propellant. Dropping the booster engine and fairing reduced the dry weight to , a mere 2.02% of the initial gross weight of the vehicle (still excluding payload). This very low dry weight gave Atlas D a range of up to , or to orbit payloads without requiring an upper stage. It first flew on 14 April 1959.

To provide the United States with an interim or emergency ICBM capability, in September 1959 the Air Force deployed three SM-65D Atlas missiles on open launch pads at Vandenberg AFB, California, under the operational control of the 576th Strategic Missile Squadron, 704th Strategic Missile Wing. Completely exposed to the elements, the three missiles were serviced by a gantry crane. One missile was on operational alert at all times. They remained on alert until 1 May 1964.

=== SM-65E Atlas ===
The SM-65E Atlas, or Atlas-E, was the first 3-engine operational variant of the Atlas missile, the third engine resulting from splitting the two booster thrust chambers into separate engines with independent sets of turbopumps. It first flew on 11 October 1960, and was deployed as an operational ICBM from September 1961 until March 1965.

A major enhancement in the Atlas E was the new all-inertial system that obviated the need for ground control facilities. Since the missiles were no longer tied to a central guidance control facility, the launchers could be dispersed more widely in what was called a 1 × 9 configuration, with one missile silo located at one launch site each for the nine missiles assigned to the squadron.

Atlas-E launches were conducted from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at Launch Complexes 11 and 13, and Vandenberg Air Force Base at Vandenberg AFB Operational Silo Test Facility, Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex 576 and Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 3.

=== SM-65F Atlas ===
The SM-65F Atlas, or Atlas-F, was the final operational variant of the Atlas missile. It first flew on 8 August 1961, and was deployed as an operational ICBM between September 1962 and April 1965.

The Atlas F was essentially a quick-firing version of the Atlas E, modified to be stored in a vertical position inside underground concrete and steel silos. It was nearly identical to the E version except for interfaces associated with their different basing modes (underground silo for F) and the fuel management system. When stored, the missile sat atop an elevator. If placed on alert, it was fueled with RP-1 (kerosene) liquid fuel, which could be stored inside the missile for extended periods. If a decision was made to launch, it was fueled with liquid oxygen. Once the liquid oxygen fueling was complete, the elevator raised the missile to the surface for launching.

This method of storage allowed the Atlas F to be launched in about ten minutes, a saving of about five minutes over the Atlas D and Atlas E, both of which were stored horizontally and had to be raised to a vertical position before being fueled.

Atlas-F launches were conducted from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at Launch Complexes 11 and 13, and Vandenberg Air Force Base at OSTF-2, Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex 576 and Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 3.

==Operational deployment==

Strategic Air Command deployed 13 operational Atlas ICBM squadrons between 1959 and 1962. Each of the three missile variants, the Atlas D, E, and F series, were deployed and based in progressively more secure launchers.

===Service history===
The number of Atlas intercontinental ballistic missiles in service, at the end of each year:

===Atlas-D deployment===

In September 1959 the first operational Atlas ICBM squadron went on operational alert at F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming equipped with six SM-65D Atlas missiles based in above-ground launchers. Three additional Atlas D squadrons, two near F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming, and one at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, were based in above-ground launchers that provided blast protection against over-pressures of only .
These units were:
* 389th Strategic Missile Wing
: Francis E. Warren AFB, Wyoming (2 September 1960 – 1 July 1964)
: 564th Strategic Missile Squadron (6 missiles)
: 565th Strategic Missile Squadron (9 missiles)

* 385th Bombardment (later Strategic Aerospace) Wing
: Offutt AFB, Nebraska (30 March 1961 – 1 October 1964)
: 549th Strategic Missile Squadron (9 missiles)

The first site at Warren for the 564th SMS consisted of six launchers grouped together, controlled by two launch operations buildings, and clustered around a central guidance control facility. This was called the 3 × 2 configuration: two launch complexes of three missiles each constituted a squadron.

At the second Warren site for the 565th SMS and at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, for the 549th SMS, the missiles were based in a 3 x 3 configuration: three launchers and one combined guidance control/launch facility constituted a launch complex, and three complexes comprised a squadron. At these later sites the combined guidance and control facility measured with a partial basement. A dispersal technique of spreading the launch complexes were apart was also employed to reduce the risk that one powerful nuclear warhead could destroy multiple launch sites.

===Atlas-E deployment===
The SM-65E Atlas were based in horizontal &quot;semi-hard&quot; or &quot;coffin&quot; facilities that protected the missile against over-pressures up to . In this arrangement the missile, its support facilities, and the launch operations building were housed in reinforced concrete structures that were buried underground; only the roofs protruded above ground level. These units were:
* 92nd Bombardment (later Strategic Aerospace) Wing
: Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington (28 September 1961 – 17 February 1965)
: 567th Strategic Missile Squadron, (9 missiles)

* 21st Strategic Aerospace Division
: Forbes AFB, Kansas (10 October 1961 – 4 January 1965)
: 548th Strategic Missile Squadron, (9 missiles)

* 389th Strategic Missile Wing
: Francis E. Warren AFB, Wyoming (20 November 1961 – 4 January 1965)
: 566th Strategic Missile Squadron (9 missiles)

===Atlas-F deployment===
The six SM-65F Atlas squadrons were the first ICBMs to be stored vertically in underground silos. Built of heavily reinforced concrete, the huge silos were designed to protect the missiles from over-pressures of up to . These units were:
* 310th Bombardment (later Strategic Aerospace) Wing
: Schilling AFB, Kansas (9 September 1962 – 1 February 1965)
: 550th Strategic Missile Squadron (12 missiles)

* 98th Strategic Aerospace Wing
: Lincoln AFB, Nebraska (15 September 1962 – 10 March 1965)
: 551st Strategic Missile Squadron (12 missiles)

* 11th Bombardment (later Strategic Aerospace) Wing
: Altus AFB, Oklahoma (9 October 1962 – 30 December 1964)
: 577th Strategic Missile Squadron (12 missiles)
* 96th Bombardment (later Strategic Aerospace) Wing
: Dyess AFB, Texas (15 November 1962 – 1 December 1964)
: 578th Strategic Missile Squadron (12 missiles)

* 6th Bombardment (later Strategic Aerospace) Wing
: Walker AFB, New Mexico (30 November 1962 – 5 January 1965)
: 579th Strategic Missile Squadron (12 missiles)

* 820th Air (later Strategic Aerospace) Division
: Plattsburgh AFB, New York (20 December 1962 – 12 March 1965)
: 556th Strategic Missile Squadron (12 missiles)

The Atlas F&#x27;s employment was dangerous due to the flammability of the stored liquid rocket fuels. Four sites and their missiles were destroyed during propellant loading exercises (known as PLXs) when liquid oxygen leaked and fires ensued. On 1 June 1963 Roswell&#x27;s site 579-1 was destroyed by explosion and fire. On 13 February 1964 Roswell&#x27;s site 579-5 was destroyed, and a month later on 9 March 1964 site 579-2 was also destroyed by explosion and fire. Finally, on 14 May 1964 an Altus AFB site, 577-6 in Frederick, Oklahoma, was also destroyed by explosion and fire during a PLX. Fortunately the crews all survived. None of the damaged sites were repaired or returned to service. 

===Retirement as an ICBM===
After the solid-fuel LGM-30 Minuteman had become operational in early 1963, the Atlas became rapidly obsolete. By October 1964, all Atlas D missiles had been phased out, followed by the Atlas E/F in April 1965. About 350 Atlas ICBMs of all versions were built, with a peak deployment level of 129 (30 D, 27 E, 72 F). Despite its relatively short life span, Atlas served as the proving ground for many new missile technologies. Perhaps more importantly, its development spawned the organization, policies, and procedures that paved the way for all of the later ICBM programs.

After its retirement from operational ICBM service in 1965, the ICBMs were refurbished and used for close to forty years as space launch vehicle boosters.

==Survivors==
* HGM-16F Atlas is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. For years the missile was displayed outside the museum. In 1998 it was removed from display. It was restored by the museum&#x27;s restoration staff and returned to display in the museum&#x27;s new Missile Silo Gallery in 2007. The stage is currently in storage at the museum. The white nose cone atop the museum&#x27;s Atlas is an AVCO IV re-entry vehicle built to contain a nuclear warhead. This nose cone actually stood alert in defense of the United States, as it was initially installed on an Atlas on 2 October 1962 at a Denton Valley launch site near Clyde, Texas.
* Atlas 8A is displayed in front of the Strategic Air Command &amp; Aerospace Museum in Ashland, Nebraska; reconfigured as an Atlas D.
* Atlas 2E is on display in front of the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum at Gillespie Field, El Cajon, California.
* Atlas 2D mounted with a Mercury capsule is on display in the Rocket Garden at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, Merritt Island, Florida.
* Atlas 10F is on display at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

Former survivor:
* Atlas 5A (56–6742) was formerly on display on the lawn in front of the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, but was removed in February 2015 and dismantled.

<doc id="101398" wikidata="Q898721" url="?curid=101398" title="Hamlet (1996 film)">
<text>Hamlet is a 1996 British epic historical drama film serving as an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot;, adapted and directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also stars as Prince Hamlet. The film also features Derek Jacobi as King Claudius, Julie Christie as Queen Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Michael Maloney as Laertes, Richard Briers as Polonius, and Nicholas Farrell as Horatio. Other cast members include Robin Williams, Gérard Depardieu, Jack Lemmon, Billy Crystal, Rufus Sewell, Charlton Heston, Richard Attenborough, Judi Dench, John Gielgud and Ken Dodd.

The film is the first unabridged theatrical film version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, running more than four hours. The setting is updated to the 19th century, but its Elizabethan English text remains the same. Blenheim Palace is the setting used for the exterior grounds of Elsinore Castle, and interiors were photographed at Shepperton Studios. &quot;Hamlet&quot; was the last major dramatic motion picture to be filmed entirely on 70 mm film until 2011, with the release of the documentary &quot;Samsara&quot;.

Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; has been regarded as one of the best Shakespeare film adaptations ever made. However, it was a box-office bomb, mostly due to its limited release, grossing just under US$5 million on a budget of $18 million. The film received four Oscar nominations for the 69th Academy Awards for Best Art Direction (Tim Harvey), Best Costume Design (Alexandra Byrne), Best Original Score (Patrick Doyle) and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay (Kenneth Branagh).

== Plot ==
Prince Hamlet of Denmark is the son of the recently deceased King Hamlet and nephew of King Claudius, his father&#x27;s brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet&#x27;s widow Gertrude, Hamlet&#x27;s mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a longstanding feud with neighbouring Norway, in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras&#x27;s infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king&#x27;s son, Prince Fortinbras, is imminent.

On a cold night on the ramparts of Elsinore, the Danish royal castle, the sentries Bernardo and Marcellus discuss a ghost resembling the late King Hamlet that they have recently seen, and bring Prince Hamlet&#x27;s friend Horatio as a witness. After the ghost appears again, the three vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have witnessed.

As the court gathers the next day while King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser, Polonius, Hamlet watches glumly. During the court, Claudius grants permission for Polonius&#x27;s son, Laertes, to return to school in France and sends envoys to inform the King of Norway of Fortinbras. Claudius also scolds Hamlet for continuing to grieve over his father and forbids him to return to his schooling in Wittenberg. After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father&#x27;s death and his mother&#x27;s hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.

As Laertes prepares to depart for a visit to France, Polonius offers him advice that culminates in the maxim, &quot;to thine own self be true&quot;. Polonius&#x27;s daughter, Ophelia, admits that she has interest in Hamlet, but Laertes warns her against seeking the prince&#x27;s attention, and Polonius orders her to reject his advances. That night on the rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, telling the prince that he was murdered by Claudius and demanding that Hamlet avenge him. Hamlet agrees, and the ghost vanishes. The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that he plans to &quot;put an antic disposition on&quot;, or act like he has gone mad, and forces them to swear to keep secret his plans for revenge. However, he remains uncertain of the ghost&#x27;s reliability.

Soon after, Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the night before, half-dressed and behaving erratically. Polonius blames the love for Hamlet&#x27;s madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As he enters to do so, the King and Queen finish welcoming Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the students investigate the cause of Hamlet&#x27;s mood and behaviour. Additional news requires that Polonius waits to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the King of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father&#x27;s battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, although they will pass through Danish territory to get there.

Polonius tells Claudius and Gertrude of his theory regarding Hamlet&#x27;s behaviour and speaks to Hamlet in a hall of the castle to try to uncover more information. Hamlet feigns madness and subtly insults Polonius all the while. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet warmly greets his &quot;friends&quot; but quickly discerns that they are spies. Hamlet admits that he is upset at his situation but refuses to give the true reason, instead commenting on &quot;What a piece of work is a man&quot;. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that they have brought with them a troupe of actors whom they met while travelling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, asks them to deliver a soliloquy about the death of King Priam, as witnessed by Queen Hecuba, at the climax of the Trojan War. Impressed by their delivery of the speech, he plots to stage &quot;The Murder of Gonzago&quot;, a play featuring a death in the style of his father&#x27;s murder, and to determine the truth of the ghost&#x27;s story, as well as Claudius&#x27;s guilt or innocence, by studying Claudius&#x27;s reaction.

Polonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet&#x27;s love letters and tokens of affection to the prince while he and Claudius watch from afar to evaluate Hamlet&#x27;s reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia&#x27;s entrance, musing whether &quot;to be or not to be&quot;. When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet&#x27;s things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries &quot;get thee to a nunnery&quot;, though it is unclear whether this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing the Player King murdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room; for Hamlet, this is proof positive of his uncle&#x27;s guilt.

Gertrude summons Hamlet to her chamber to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has possession of his ill-gotten goods: his brother&#x27;s crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. On his way to visit his mother, Hamlet sneaks up behind Claudius but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while the ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s father is stuck in purgatory. In the queen&#x27;s bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, calls for help as Gertrude, believing Hamlet wants to kill her, calls out for help herself.

Hamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius, but he pulls aside the curtain and sees his error. In a rage, Hamlet brutally insults his mother for her apparent ignorance of Claudius&#x27;s villainy, but the ghost enters and reprimands Hamlet for his inaction and harsh words. Unable to see or hear the ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet&#x27;s conversation with it as further evidence of madness. After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet leaves, dragging Polonius&#x27;s corpse away.

Hamlet jokes with Claudius about where he has hidden Polonius&#x27;s body, and the King, fearing for his life, sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to accompany Hamlet to England with a sealed letter to the King of England requesting that Hamlet be executed immediately.

Unhinged by grief at Polonius&#x27;s death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore. Laertes arrives back from France, enraged by his father&#x27;s death and his sister&#x27;s madness. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible, but a letter soon arrives indicating that Hamlet has returned to Denmark, foiling Claudius&#x27;s plan. Claudius switches tactics, proposing a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet to settle their differences. Laertes will be given a poison-tipped foil, and, if that fails, Claudius will offer Hamlet poisoned wine as a congratulation. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned, though it is unclear whether it was suicide or an accident caused by her madness.

Horatio has received a letter from Hamlet, explaining that the prince escaped by negotiating with pirates who attempted to attack his England-bound ship, and the friends reunite offstage. Two gravediggers discuss Ophelia&#x27;s apparent suicide while digging her grave. Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with one of the gravediggers, who unearths the skull of a jester from Hamlet&#x27;s childhood, Yorick. Hamlet picks up the skull, saying, &quot;alas, poor Yorick&quot;, as he contemplates mortality. Ophelia&#x27;s funeral procession approaches, led by Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio initially hide, but when Hamlet realizes that Ophelia is the one being buried, he reveals himself, proclaiming his love for her. Laertes and Hamlet fight by Ophelia&#x27;s graveside, but the brawl is broken up.

Back at Elsinore, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he had discovered Claudius&#x27;s letter with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&#x27;s belongings and replaced it with a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead of him. A foppish courtier, Osric, interrupts the conversation to deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet, who, despite Horatio&#x27;s pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius&#x27;s plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor.

Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living while Hamlet does not, says that he will perform suicide by drinking the dregs of Gertrude&#x27;s poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live and tell his story. Hamlet dies on the floor in front of Horatio, proclaiming &quot;the rest is silence&quot;. Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching toward Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz&#x27;s and Guildenstern&#x27;s deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself and orders a military funeral to honour Prince Hamlet.

==Cast==

===Main characters===
*Kenneth Branagh as Prince Hamlet, the story&#x27;s protagonist and Prince of Denmark. He is the son of the late King Hamlet and heir to the throne of Denmark. At first, Hamlet is depressed about his father&#x27;s death and is angered by his mother Gertrude&#x27;s swift remarriage to his uncle Claudius. However, Hamlet is told by the ghost of his father that Claudius murdered him, usurping his throne. Hamlet swears to avenge his father&#x27;s murder. Branagh described his interpretation of the title role as considerably less &quot;neurotic&quot; than others, removing the Oedipal fixation prominently featured in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1948 film adaptation, among others. During the scenes in which Hamlet pretends to be insane, Branagh portrayed the Prince as manic.
*Derek Jacobi as King Claudius, the play&#x27;s antagonist and brother of the late king. He murders his brother by pouring poison into his ear while he sleeps. He usurps his brother&#x27;s title and marries his widow. At first, believing Hamlet to have been driven mad by the loss of his father, Claudius tries to spy on Hamlet. When Claudius learns that Hamlet knows of the murder, he tries to use Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two of Hamlet&#x27;s schoolmates, to murder his nephew. Jacobi appeared in the title role in the BBC&#x27;s 1980 made-for-television version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.
*Julie Christie as Gertrude, Queen of Denmark and wife to both the late King Hamlet and King Claudius, whom she swiftly married following the former&#x27;s death — ignorant of the foul play that caused his death.
*Richard Briers as Polonius, the Lord Chamberlain. An impertinent busybody, Polonius believes Hamlet to be mad and convinces Claudius to join him in spying on the prince. Hamlet eventually kills him, believing him to be Claudius.
*Kate Winslet as Ophelia, noblewoman of Denmark and daughter of Polonius. Ophelia is in love with Hamlet until she is advised by her father Polonius and brother Laertes to end their relationship. She is eventually driven mad by both Hamlet&#x27;s rejection and her father&#x27;s murder and drowns herself.
*Nicholas Farrell as Horatio, a good friend of Hamlet whom he met while attending Wittenberg University.
*Michael Maloney as Laertes, the son of Polonius and brother of Ophelia. After instructing his sister to have no further relations with Hamlet, he departs for Paris. On news of his father&#x27;s murder, Laertes returns to Denmark, leading a mob to storm the castle. Claudius incites Laertes to kill Hamlet and avenge Polonius&#x27;s death. He later conspires with Claudius to murder Hamlet during a fencing duel.
*Rufus Sewell as Fortinbras, the Norwegian crown prince. Played mostly in flashback and frequently referenced throughout the film, Fortinbras storms Elsinore castle with his army during the final scene, and assumes the vacant throne of Denmark.

*Billy Crystal as the First Gravedigger, a sexton digging Ophelia&#x27;s grave who makes a case for why she should not receive a Christian burial before having a quick dialogue with Hamlet. Later, he presents the skull of Yorick to Hamlet, not knowing Hamlet&#x27;s history with the jester.
*Simon Russell Beale as the Second Gravedigger.

==Production==

===Origins===
Aspects of the film&#x27;s staging were based on Adrian Noble&#x27;s Royal Shakespeare Company production of the play, in which Branagh played the title role.

===Text===
The film uses a conflated text based on the 1623 First Folio, with additions from the Second Quarto and amendments from other sources. According to a note appended to the published screenplay:

===Style===
Despite using a full text, Branagh&#x27;s film is also very visual; it makes frequent use of flashbacks to depict scenes that are described but not performed in Shakespeare&#x27;s text, such as Hamlet&#x27;s childhood friendship with Yorick, or scenes merely implied by the play&#x27;s text, such as Hamlet&#x27;s sexual relationship with Ophelia. The film also uses very long single takes for numerous scenes.

In a radical departure from previous &quot;Hamlet&quot; films, Branagh set the internal scenes in a vibrantly colourful setting, featuring a throne room dominated by mirrored doors. Film scholar Samuel Crowl called the setting &quot;&quot;film noir&quot; with all the lights on&quot;. Branagh chose Victorian era costuming and furnishings, using Blenheim Palace, built in the early 18th century as the seat of the Dukes of Marlborough, as Elsinore Castle for the external scenes. Harry Keyishan has suggested that the film is structured as an epic, courting comparison with &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;. As J. Lawrence Guntner pointed out, comparisons with the latter are heightened by the presence of Julie Christie (&quot;Zhivago&quot; Lara) as Gertrude.

===Filming===
&quot;Hamlet&quot; was shot in Panavision Super 70 by Alex Thomson. It was the last feature film to be entirely shot in 70 mm until production of &quot;Samsara&quot; in 2011. Branagh was among the few to use 65mm film cameras after that, on his 2017 film &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;. The filming was done from 25 January to 12 April 1996.

===Music===
The score of &quot;Hamlet&quot; was composed and co-produced by frequent-Kenneth-Branagh-collaborator Patrick Doyle, and conducted by Robert Ziegler. Doyle composed three primary themes for the film to accompany the characters of Ophelia, Claudius and Hamlet, which are varied throughout the score. The &quot;simple, childlike&quot; theme for Ophelia is mostly string-dominant, often performed by a string quartet yet occasionally accompanied by a full string ensemble or mixed chorus. For Claudius, Doyle composed a theme in the form of a demented canon, using more 20th-century harmonies. The theme for Hamlet was considered by Doyle to be &quot;the most daunting and elusive&quot; to conceive, before settling on a more &quot;simple&quot; motif to accompany the contemplative character.

The soundtrack album was released on 10 December 1996 through Sony Classical Records and features 26 tracks, with a running time of more than 76 minutes. For his work on the film, Doyle received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score.

==Release==
&quot;Hamlet&quot; was screened out of competition at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. A shorter edit of the Branagh film, at approximately two and a half hours in length, was also shown in some markets.

===Home media===
A two-disc DVD set was released in the United States and Canada on 14 August 2007. It includes a full-length commentary by Branagh and Shakespeare scholar Russell Jackson. A Blu-ray was released on 17 August 2010 in the United States and Canada with similar additional features, including an introduction by Kenneth Branagh, the featurette &quot;To Be on Camera: A History with Hamlet&quot;, the 1996 Cannes Film Festival Promo, and a Shakespeare Movies Trailer Gallery.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Hamlet&quot; was not a success at the box office, mostly due to its limited release. The film earned more than $90,000 in its opening weekend playing on three screens. It made more than $30,000 in the Czech Republic, and more than $545,000 in Spain. It ultimately played on fewer than 100 screens in the United States, bringing its total gross to less than $5 million on a budget of $18 million.

===Critical response===
&quot;Hamlet&quot; received positive reviews. It currently holds a 95% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 57 reviews. The consensus reads: &quot;Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s sprawling, finely textured adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s masterpiece lives up to its source material, using strong performances and a sharp cinematic focus to create a powerfully resonant film that wastes none of its 246 minutes.&quot;

Roger Ebert, film critic of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, awarded the film four stars out of four, comparing it to Laurence Olivier&#x27;s lauded 1948 version, stating, &quot;Branagh&#x27;s Hamlet lacks the narcissistic intensity of Laurence Olivier&#x27;s (in the 1948 Academy Award winner), but the film as a whole is better, placing Hamlet in the larger context of royal politics, and making him less a subject for pity.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also praised both Branagh&#x27;s direction and performance, writing, &quot;This &quot;Hamlet&quot;, like Branagh&#x27;s version of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, takes a frank, try-anything approach to sustaining its entertainment value, but its gambits are most often evidence of Branagh&#x27;s solid showmanship. His own performance is the best evidence of all.&quot;

&quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; praised the attention given to Shakespeare&#x27;s language, &quot;giving the meter of the verse a musician&#x27;s respect&quot;; Branagh said that his aim was &quot;telling the story with utmost clarity and simplicity&quot;.

Some critics, notably Stanley Kauffmann, declared the film to be the finest motion picture version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Online film critic James Berardinelli gave the film a four-star review and declared that the Branagh &quot;Hamlet&quot; is the finest Shakespeare adaptation, rating it as the best film of 1996, the fourth best film of the 1990s, and one of his top 101 favourite films of all time, saying, &quot;From the moment it was first announced that Branagh would attempt an unabridged &quot;Hamlet&quot;, I never doubted that it would be a worthy effort... I have seen dozens of versions of this play, and none has ever held me in such a grip of awe.&quot;

The film did have its detractors, however. Lloyd Rose of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;the film equivalent of a lushly illustrated coffee-table book&quot;. Desson Thomson wrote of Branagh&#x27;s performance that &quot;the choices he makes are usually overextended. When it&#x27;s time to be funny, he skitters over the top. When he&#x27;s sad or touched, he makes a mechanical, catching noise in his throat.&quot;

John Simon called Branagh&#x27;s performance &quot;brawny&quot; and &quot;not easy to like&quot; and said that Branagh&#x27;s direction used &quot;explicitness where Shakespeare... settled for subtlety or mere suggestion&quot;.

Leonard Maltin, who gave the film a positive three stars in his &quot;Movie and Video Guide&quot; (and gave the Olivier version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; four stars), praised the cinematography by Alex Thomson, but stated that &quot;Branagh essentially gives a stage performance that is nearly as over-the-top as some of his directorial touches&quot;.

Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; ranks number 3 on the Rotten Tomatoes list of Greatest Shakespeare Movies, behind Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Ran&quot; (1985, based on &quot;King Lear&quot;), which ranks in second place, and Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989), which ranks in first place.

===Accolades===
== Game ==
A spin-off game titled &quot;Hamlet: A Murder Mystery&quot;, directed by historian Jean-Pierre Isbouts, was a co-production by Pantheon and Castle Rock Entertainment. Also produced in 1996, this was arguably the first video game based on a Shakespeare work. The CD-ROM is divided into two parts titled: &quot;To be&quot; (in which players can play Hamlet in the narrative) and &quot;Not to be&quot; (in which players can read the texts). In gameplay, players wander through the castle trying to locate the killer. The game combines material from the film with original footage, animation, and games and puzzles.

GalleyCat deemed it &quot;The Hamlet Video Game That Time Forgot&quot;. Shakespeare Studies, Volume 38, thought that the game shows the film&#x27;s potential as a middle ground for digital works by offering a sound narrative that can be manipulated by player choices. &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; In An Era of Textual Exhaustion&quot; felt that the game offers a reworking of the plot that gives the player agency and a sense of immersion. Quandary praised the game for its multi-layered nature and its packaging.

<text>Hamlet is a 1990 drama film based on the Shakespearean tragedy of the same name, directed by Franco Zeffirelli and starring Mel Gibson as the eponymous character. The film also features Glenn Close, Alan Bates, Paul Scofield, Ian Holm, Helena Bonham Carter, Stephen Dillane, and Nathaniel Parker. An international co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy, the film was the first produced by Icon Productions, a company co-founded by Gibson.

==Plot==
The film largely follows the plot of the original play, albeit omitting certain dialogue and minor characters to fit the average length of a feature film. This version also makes no modern adaptations.

==Cast==
==Production==
Zeffirelli announced production of the film in April 1989 at a press conference in Los Angeles. Mel Gibson was at that same press conference, where it was announced that he would play Hamlet. Zeffirelli had set out to make a Shakespearian adaptation that would be accessible and appealing to younger viewers, and casting Gibson was considered an intent to lure said audience into seeing it. Glenn Close was another obvious choice, having had recent box-office success with such Hollywood thrillers as &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; and &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;.

Financing was provided on loan from a Dutch bank by Carolco Pictures, Barry Spikings&#x27; Nelson Entertainment, and Sovereign Pictures for approximately $16 million. Filming was set to begin on 23 April 1990, with an 11-week shooting schedule.

Gibson, who had grown up idolizing one of his costars, legendary Shakespearean actor Paul Scofield, compared the experience of performing Shakespeare alongside him to being, &quot;thrown into the ring with Mike Tyson&quot;.

Dunnottar Castle, Stonehaven and Blackness Castle were used as locations in the film. Dover Castle provided the main location for Elsinore Castle, the home of Hamlet and his family. Interiors were filmed at Shepperton Studios in London.

Norma Moriceau was the project&#x27;s initial costume designer, but quit for unknown reasons, to be replaced by Maurizio Millenotti. Tailors from Shepperton assembled the costumes.

The film attracted little attention from major Hollywood studios, until post-production, when companies such as Warner Bros., Paramount, and Orion expressed interest in purchasing the film. Nelson Entertainment, which held the North American distribution rights, licensed theatrical exhibition to Warner Bros. as part of an incentive to lure Gibson into making &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;. Despite Nelson owning a home video arm, they sold the video rights to Warner Bros. as well. Warner Bros. attempted to attract high schools with study guides and vouchers for students. An hour-long educational video titled &quot;Mel Gibson Goes Back to School&quot; was released in conjunction with the film, showing the actor lecturing on &quot;Hamlet&quot; to a group of high-school students in Los Angeles.

==Adaptation and interpretation==
Film scholar Deborah Cartmell has suggested that Zeffirelli&#x27;s Shakespeare films are appealing because they are &quot;sensual rather than cerebral&quot;, an approach by which he aims to make Shakespeare &quot;even more popular&quot;. To this end, he cast Gibson – then famous for the &quot;Mad Max&quot; and &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; films – in the title role. Cartmell also notes that the text is drastically cut, but with the effect of enhancing the roles of the women.

J. Lawrence Guntner has suggested that Zeffirelli&#x27;s cinematography borrows heavily from the action film genre that made Gibson famous, noting that its average shot length is less than six seconds. In casting Gibson, the director has been said to have made the star&#x27;s reputation part of the performance, encouraging the audience &quot;to see the Gibson that they have come to expect from his other films&quot;. Indeed, Zeffirelli cast Gibson after watching the scene in &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; in which Gibson&#x27;s character, Martin Riggs, contemplates suicide. The fight between Hamlet and Laertes is an example of using Gibson&#x27;s experience in action movies; Gibson depicts Hamlet as an experienced swordsman.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Initial reviews for Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; were mixed. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, calling Mel Gibson&#x27;s portrayal of the Danish Prince &quot;a strong, intelligent performance.&quot; Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;naturalistic, emotionally-charged&quot; direction and also commended Gibson&#x27;s &quot;visceral&quot; performance, describing it as &quot;strong, intelligent and safely beyond ridicule.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the film a negative review, calling Gibson&#x27;s performance &quot;an earnest but pedestrian reading.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Gibson&#x27;s Hamlet an &quot;Oedipal wreck&quot; and stated that either Kenneth Branagh or Daniel Day-Lewis would have been preferable to play Hamlet than Gibson. A later editorial in the same paper would refer to Gibson&#x27;s performance as &quot;the most unaffected and lucid Hamlet in memory.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 37 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus was, &quot;It may lack some of the depth and complexity of the play, but Mel Gibson and Franco Zeffirelli make a surprisingly successful team.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 53% based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A on scale of A to F.

===Box office===
The film grossed $20.7 million in the United States and Canada and $1.6 million in the United Kingdom.
===Accolades===
The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Best Art Direction (Dante Ferretti, Francesca Lo Schiavo) and Best Costume Design (Maurizio Millenotti). Sir Alan Bates received a BAFTA nomination as Best Supporting Actor for playing Claudius.

<doc id="101407" wikidata="Q55294" url="?curid=101407" title="Kenneth Branagh">
<text>Sir Kenneth Charles Branagh ( ; born 10 December 1960) is a British actor and filmmaker. Born in Belfast and raised primarily in Reading, Berkshire, Branagh trained at RADA in London and served as its president from 2015 to 2024. His accolades include an Academy Award, four BAFTAs, two Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Olivier Award. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 2012, and was given Freedom of the City in his native Belfast in 2018. In 2020, he was ranked in 20th place on &quot;The Irish Times&quot; list of Ireland&#x27;s greatest film actors.

Branagh has directed and starred in several film adaptations of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, including &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989), &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1993), &quot;Othello&quot; (1995), &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996), and &quot;As You Like It&quot; (2006).

He received a Primetime Emmy Award and an International Emmy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of SS leader Reinhard Heydrich in the HBO film &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (2001).

== Early life and education ==
Kenneth Charles Branagh was born in Belfast on 10 December 1960, the son of working-class Protestant parents Frances ( Harper) and William Branagh. His father was a plumber and joiner who ran a company that specialised in fitting partitions and suspended ceilings. He is the middle of three children, with an older brother and a younger sister, and lived in the Tigers Bay area of Belfast. He was educated at Grove Primary School. In early 1970, at the age of nine, Branagh moved with his family to England to escape the Troubles; they settled in Berkshire, where Branagh grew up in Reading and attended Whiteknights Primary School and Meadway School in Tilehurst. He appeared in school productions such as &quot;Toad of Toad Hall&quot; and &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot;

At school, Branagh learned to speak with an RP accent to avoid bullying. Discussing his identity, he later said, &quot;I feel Irish. I don&#x27;t think you can take Belfast out of the boy.&quot; He also attributes his &quot;love of words&quot; to his Irish heritage. He attended the amateur Reading Cine &amp; Video Society (now called Reading Film &amp; Video Makers) and was a keen member of Progress Theatre, of which he is now the patron. After disappointing A-level results in English, history, and sociology, he went on to train at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. In 1980, RADA&#x27;s principal Hugh Cruttwell asked Branagh to perform a soliloquy from &quot;Hamlet&quot; for Queen Elizabeth II during one of her visits to the academy.

== Career ==
=== 1980–1988: Rise to prominence ===

Branagh&#x27;s first film appearance was as an uncredited role as a Cambridge student in the sports drama &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981). Branagh achieved early success in his native Northern Ireland for his role as Billy, the title character in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; trilogy known as the &quot;Billy Plays&quot; (1982–84), written by Graham Reid and set in Belfast. He received acclaim in the UK for his stage performances, first winning the 1982 SWET Award for Best Newcomer, for his role as Judd in Julian Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Another Country&quot;, after leaving RADA. Branagh was part of the new wave of actors to emerge from the academy. Others included Jonathan Pryce, Juliet Stevenson, Alan Rickman, Anton Lesser, Bruce Payne and Fiona Shaw. In 1984, he appeared in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of &quot;Henry V&quot;, directed by Adrian Noble. The production played to sold-out audiences, especially at the Barbican in the City of London. It was this production that he adapted for the film version of the play in 1989. He and David Parfitt founded the Renaissance Theatre Company in 1987, following success with several productions on the London Fringe, including Branagh&#x27;s full-scale production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Lyric Studio, co-starring with Samantha Bond. 

The first major Renaissance production was Branagh&#x27;s Christmas 1987 staging of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, starring Richard Briers as Malvolio and Frances Barber as Viola, and with an original score by actor, musician, and composer Patrick Doyle, who two years later was to compose the music for Branagh&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Henry V&quot;. This &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; was later adapted for television. The company&#x27;s debut season also included &quot;Public Enemy&quot;, a play written by Branagh set in his native Belfast. Also in 1987, Branagh found his first leading film role as James Moon in the British film adaptation of J.L. Carr&#x27;s book &quot;A Month in The Country&quot;. Here he plays a homosexual ex-army officer who, following the war, has taken on a job to excavate a burial in the churchyard. He instead spends most of his time looking for Saxon treasures. The film is set in a 1920s rural Yorkshire village, where Branagh’s character meets a character played by Colin Firth, also in his first major role.

Branagh became a major presence in the media and on the British stage when Renaissance collaborated with Birmingham Rep for a 1988 touring season of three Shakespeare plays under the umbrella title of &quot;Renaissance Shakespeare on the Road&quot;, which also played a repertory season at the Phoenix Theatre in London. It featured directorial debuts for Judi Dench with &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (starring Branagh and Samantha Bond as Benedick and Beatrice), Geraldine McEwan with &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and Derek Jacobi directing Branagh in the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, with Sophie Thompson as Ophelia. Critic Milton Shulman of the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; wrote: &quot;On the positive side Branagh has the vitality of Olivier, the passion of Gielgud, the assurance of Guinness, to mention but three famous actors who have essayed the role. On the negative side, he has not got the magnetism of Olivier, nor the mellifluous voice quality of Gielgud nor the intelligence of Guinness.&quot;

=== 1989–1999: Breakthrough ===

A year later, in 1989, Branagh co-starred with Emma Thompson in the Renaissance company&#x27;s stage revival of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;. Judi Dench directed both the theatre and television productions, presented first in Belfast then at the London Coliseum and Lyric Theatre. In 1990, he wrote his autobiography &quot;Beginning&quot;, recounting his life and acting career up to that point. In the book&#x27;s introduction, he admits that the main reason for producing the book was &quot;money&quot; and that &quot;The deal was made, and a handsome advance was paid out. The advance provided the funds to buy accommodation for the Company&#x27;s offices, this moving Renaissance out of my flat and bringing me a little closer to sanity.&quot;

Notable non-Shakespeare films in which Branagh has acted in and directed include the neo-noir romantic thriller &quot;Dead Again&quot; (1991) starring Branagh, Emma Thompson, Andy Garcia, and Derek Jacobi. The film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival where it competed for the Golden Bear and received critical acclaim. The following year he directed the British comedy-drama film &quot;Peter&#x27;s Friends&quot;, with a cast including former student friends Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie, Tony Slattery, and Stephen Fry, as well as Imelda Staunton and Rita Rudner. The film received positive reviews with critics comparing it favorably as the British version of &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1982). The film earned two Evening Standard British Film Awards for Branagh and Thompson.

Branagh is known for his film adaptations of William Shakespeare, beginning with the critically acclaimed &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989), later followed by Shakespeare&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1993). The latter film premiered at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival where it competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or. The film starred Branagh, Thompson, Denzel Washington, Kate Beckinsale, Keanu Reeves, and Michael Keaton. Vincent Canby film critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Branagh&#x27;s direction writing, &quot;Now he has accomplished something equally difficult. He has taken a Shakespearean romantic comedy, the sort of thing that usually turns to mush on the screen, and made a movie that is triumphantly romantic, comic and, most surprising of all, emotionally alive.&quot;

However, Branagh had a commercial misstep with his adaptation of the horror film &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; (1994). The film starred Branagh, Robert De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter, Tom Hulce, and Ian Holm. It premiered at the London Film Festival where it received negative reviews. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Janet Maslin wrote of Branagh&#x27;s failure, &quot;[He] is in over his head. He displays neither the technical finesse to handle a big, visually ambitious film nor the insight to develop a stirring new version of this story. Instead, this is a bland, no-fault &quot;Frankenstein&quot; for the &#x27;90s, short on villainy but loaded with the tragically misunderstood&quot;. He then directed the minor British romantic comedy &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot; (1995) to positive reviews.

Also in 1995, Branagh portrayed Iago in Oliver Parker&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; (1995) acting opposite Laurence Fishburne as Othello. The film received largely positive reviews, particularly for Branagh&#x27;s performance which earned a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role nomination. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised his acting writing, &quot;Mr Branagh&#x27;s superb performance, as the man whose Machiavellian scheming guides the story of Othello&#x27;s downfall, guarantees this film an immediacy that any audience will understand.&quot;

Branagh returned to directing, in the acclaimed adaptation of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996). Critics have theorised it might be the greatest film adaptation of &quot;Hamlet&quot; of all time. The film is noted for its epic scale and cast. The film ran four hours and was shot completely in 70 mm film. The cast includes Branagh, Kate Winslet, Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie and Rufus Sewell. Critic Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised Branagh&#x27;s direction and acting, declaring, &quot;One of the tasks of a lifetime is to become familiar with the great plays of Shakespeare. &#x27;Hamlet&#x27; is the most opaque. Branagh&#x27;s version moved me, entertained me and made me feel for the first time at home in that doomed royal court.&quot; The film received four Academy Award nominations including for Best Adapted Screenplay for Branagh.

Post-&quot;Hamlet&quot;, Branagh took a break from directing choosing to act in films directed by auteur directors. He starred in Robert Altman&#x27;s legal thriller &quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot; (1998), Paul Greengrass&#x27; dramedy &quot;The Theory of Flight&quot; (1998) and Woody Allen&#x27;s celebrity satire &quot;Celebrity&quot; (1998). The following year he starred in the Western film &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; opposite Will Smith, Kevin Kline, and Salma Hayek, which received negative reviews. During this time Branagh took on voice roles playing the title role in BBC radio broadcasts of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, and the role of Edmund in King Lear. Branagh has narrated several audiobooks, such as &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; by C. S. Lewis and &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; by Joseph Conrad. In 1998, he narrated the 24-episode documentary series &quot;Cold War&quot;. Branagh also narrated the BBC documentaries &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;, &quot;World War I in Colour&quot;, &quot;Walking with Beasts&quot; and &quot;Walking with Monsters&quot;, and the BBC miniseries &quot;Great Composers&quot;.

=== 2000–2010: Established director ===

Branagh found commercial and critical failure with &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, which paused his directorial career. That same year he voiced Miguel in the DreamWorks Animated film &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; (2000) alongside Kevin Kline. The film received mixed reviews but has since gained a cult following. The following year he acted in the HBO film &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (2001) portraying SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich. The film is a depiction of the Wannsee Conference, where Nazi officials decided on the Final Solution. Branagh acted alongside Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci. He earned critical acclaim for his performance as well as the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.

In 2002, Branagh played A. O. Neville in the drama film &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; and portrayed a humorous role as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart in the film adaptation of J.K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;. He also portrayed Sir Ernest Shackleton in the Channel 4 television film &quot;Shackleton&quot; (2002). The film is a dramatization of the 1914 Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition&#x27;s battle for survival, for which he was nominated for a BAFTA award and an Emmy. That same year Branagh starred at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield as Richard III. In 2003, he starred in the Royal National Theatre&#x27;s production of David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Edmond&quot;. Branagh directed &quot;The Play What I Wrote&quot; in England in 2001 and directed a Broadway production in 2003.

Branagh has been involved in several made-for-TV films. Among his most acclaimed portrayals is that of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the film &quot;Warm Springs&quot; (2005), for which he received an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie nomination. The film received 16 Emmy nominations, winning five (including Outstanding Made for Television Movie); Branagh did not win the award for his portrayal. In 2006, Branagh directed the film version of &quot;As You Like It&quot; starring Romola Garai, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Kevin Kline. That same year he also directed a film version of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. Branagh has also directed the thriller &quot;Sleuth&quot; (2007), a remake of the 1972 film starring Jude Law and Michael Caine. The film received mixed reviews with critics praising the performances and noting Branagh&#x27;s darker interpretation of the material. Branagh then took the role of Major General Henning von Tresckow in &quot;Valkyrie&quot; (2008) and played the Minister, Dormandy (a parody of PMG Tony Benn), in the film &quot;The Boat That Rocked&quot; (2009).

Branagh is the star of the English-language &quot;Wallander&quot; television series, adaptations of Henning Mankell&#x27;s best-selling &quot;Wallander&quot; crime novels. Branagh plays the eponymous Inspector Kurt Wallander and also serves as the executive producer of the series. The first series of three episodes was broadcast on BBC One in November and December 2008. Branagh won the award for best actor at the 35th Broadcasting Press Guild Television and Radio Awards (2009). It was his first major television award win in the UK. He received his first BAFTA TV on 26 April 2009 for the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series. For his performance in the episode &quot;One Step Behind&quot;, he was nominated in the Outstanding Actor, Miniseries, or Movie category of the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. The role also gained him a nomination for Best Actor at the 2009 Crime Thriller Awards. The second &quot;Wallander&quot; series of three episodes aired initially in January 2010 on the BBC, and the third season aired in July 2012. The fourth and final series was shot from October 2014 to January 2015 and premiered on German TV, dubbed into German, in December 2015; it aired in the UK, with its original English soundtrack, in May and June 2016.

From September to November 2008, Branagh appeared at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre as the title character in the Donmar West End revival of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Ivanov&quot; in a new version by Tom Stoppard. His performance was lauded as the &quot;performance of the year&quot; by several critics. It won him the Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Award for Best Male Performance but did not get him a Laurence Olivier Award nomination, to the surprise of critics.

=== 2011–2020: Career expansion ===

In 2011, Branagh directed &quot;Thor&quot;, a film based on the Marvel superhero. &quot;Thor&quot;, Branagh&#x27;s return to big-budget directing, was released on 6 May 2011. The film was a part of Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It starred Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, and Anthony Hopkins. The film was a financial and critical success. That same year he portrayed Laurence Olivier in &quot;My Week with Marilyn&quot; (2011). Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised Branagh&#x27;s performance writing, &quot;It is a complete joy to see Branagh&#x27;s Olivier erupt in queeny frustration at Marilyn&#x27;s lateness, space-cadet vagueness, and preposterous Method acting indulgence...[He] revives Olivier with wit, intelligence and charm&quot;. Branagh received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination at the 84th Academy Awards losing to Christopher Plummer for &quot;Beginners&quot; (2011).

Branagh participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony portraying Isambard Kingdom Brunel during the Industrial Revolution segment &quot;Pandemonium&quot; where he performed one of Caliban&#x27;s speeches from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. In July 2013, he co-directed &quot;Macbeth&quot; at Manchester International Festival with Rob Ashford. With Branagh in the title role, Alex Kingston played Lady Macbeth and Ray Fearon featured as Macduff. The final performance of the completely sold-out run was broadcast to cinemas on 20 July as part of National Theatre Live. He repeated his performance and directorial duties opposite Ashford and Kingston when the production moved to New York City&#x27;s Park Avenue Armory in June 2014.

In April 2015, Branagh announced his formation of the Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company, in which he would appear as actor-manager. With the company, he announced he would present a season of five shows at London&#x27;s Garrick Theatre from October 2015 – November 2016. The shows were &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a double bill of &quot;Harlequinade&quot; and &quot;All On Her Own&quot;, &quot;Red Velvet&quot;, &quot;The Painkiller&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;The Entertainer&quot;. Branagh directed all but &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, in which he starred. Branagh also starred in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Harlequinade&quot; and &quot;The Painkiller&quot;. Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company also includes Judi Dench (&quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;), Zoë Wanamaker (&quot;Harlequinade/All On Her Own&quot;), Derek Jacobi, Lily James and Richard Madden (&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;) and Rob Brydon (&quot;The Painkiller&quot;). In September 2015, it was announced that &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; and &quot;The Entertainer&quot; would be broadcast in cinemas, in partnership with Picturehouse Entertainment.
In 2014 Branagh directed and acted in the action thriller &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&quot; (2014) starring Chris Pine, Keira Knightley, and Kevin Costner. The film was a box office hit but received mixed reviews from critics. The following year, Branagh directed Disney&#x27;s live-action adaptation of &quot;Cinderella&quot; (2015) starring Lily James. The film was a financial and critical success. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; praised his direction writing, &quot;the underlying property emerges untarnished, as director Kenneth Branagh reverently reimagines Charles Perrault’s fairy tale for a new generation the world over, spelling countless opportunities to exploit fresh interest in the story throughout the Disney universe.&quot;

Branagh started his first collaboration with Christopher Nolan portraying a Royal Navy Commander in the World War II action-thriller &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017), based on the British military evacuation of the French city of Dunkirk in 1940. Branagh starred alongside Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance, and Tom Hardy. The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture. That same year Branagh directed and starred in a film adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s detective novel &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (2017) as Hercule Poirot. Production began in London in November 2016. Like Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; in 1996, it is among the very few to use 65mm film cameras since 1970.

In 2018, he directed the film &quot;All Is True&quot;, in which he starred as William Shakespeare. Branagh also directed the fantasy adventure film &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot;, which was released on Disney+ in June 2020. In May 2019, Branagh was cast in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Tenet&quot; (2020) in which he portrayed the villain Andrei Sator and was praised for his performance. Branagh acted alongside Robert Pattinson, John David Washington, and Elizabeth Debicki.

=== 2021–present ===

In 2021, Branagh directed the semi-autobiographical film &quot;Belfast&quot; starring Jude Hill, Catriona Balfe, Jamie Dornan, Ciarán Hinds, and Judi Dench. In the film, Branagh explores his childhood in Northern Ireland during a period of intense religious and political conflict. The film was shot in black-and-white with flickers of colour images. The film was shown both at the Telluride Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival where it won the People&#x27;s Choice Award for the latter. The film was acclaimed by critics with Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; writing, &quot;There is a terrific warmth and tenderness to Branagh’s elegiac, autobiographical movie about the Belfast of his childhood: spryly written, beautifully acted and shot in a lustrous monochrome, with set pieces, madeleines and epiphanies that feel like a more emollient version of Terence Davies.&quot; Stephen Farber of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; noted, &quot;[While] Branagh’s most personal film is imperfect, the emotion that it builds in the final section, as the family plays out a wrenching universal drama of emigration, is searing&quot;. The film earned seven Academy Award nominations including for
Best Picture and Best Director. Branagh won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He also won the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film.

He reprised his role as Hercule Poirot in 2022&#x27;s &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; which he also directed. In March 2021, Branagh signed on to direct a biopic of music group the Bee Gees. In March 2022, it was revealed that Branagh left the project due to scheduling conflicts and was replaced by John Carney. In October 2022, it was announced that Branagh would direct and star in a third Poirot film titled &quot;A Haunting in Venice&quot;, based on Christie&#x27;s &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en Party&quot;. Branagh reunited with Christopher Nolan, portraying the Danish physicist Niels Bohr in the war epic &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023). That same year Branagh returned to the West End stage directing and acting in the title role in a stage adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; at the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in London. Arifa Akbar of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote of the production, &quot;Although Branagh delivers his Lear with slick, almost playful efficiency, it is not his towering achievement&quot;. The production is set to have an Off-Broadway transfer at The Shed in the Fall of 2024. In May 2024, it was announced Branagh would write and direct the psychological thriller film &quot;The Last Disturbance of Madeline Hynde&quot;, starring Jodie Comer; the film is expected to enter production in August 2024.

== Personal life ==

From 1989 to 1995, Branagh was married to English actress Emma Thompson, who appeared with him in &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;, &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;Dead Again&quot;, and &quot;Peter&#x27;s Friends&quot;. During their marriage, while directing and starring in &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; (1994), he began an affair with his co-star Helena Bonham Carter. After Thompson divorced him, he and Bonham Carter were in a well-publicised relationship until 1999. In 2003, he married film art director Lindsay Brunnock, whom he met during the shooting of &quot;Shackleton&quot; in 2002.

Branagh has said that he considers himself Irish. He has said that he became &quot;much more religious&quot; after listening to Laurence Olivier&#x27;s dramatic reading of the Bible every morning in preparation for his role as Olivier in &quot;My Week with Marilyn&quot;.

==Filmography==


== Awards and honours ==
Branagh has been nominated for eight Academy Awards and is the first individual to be nominated in seven different categories. His first two nominations were for &quot;Henry V&quot; (one each for directing and acting). He also received similar BAFTA Award nominations for his film work, winning one for his direction. His first BAFTA TV award came in April 2009, for Best Drama Series (&quot;Wallander&quot;). Branagh received two other Academy Award nominations for the 1992 film short subject &quot;Swan Song&quot; and for his work on the screenplay of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in 1996. His 5th nomination came for his portrayal of Laurence Olivier in &quot;My Week With Marilyn&quot; in 2012. This was followed by three nominations in 2022 for &quot;Belfast&quot; – his first nominations for Original Screenplay and Best Picture, winning for Original Screenplay. He thereby became the first person to have been nominated in seven different categories of the Academy Awards, surpassing Walt Disney, George Clooney, and Alfonso Cuarón, each of whom have received nominations in six categories (the latest equalled Branagh the year after).

He is Honorary President of NICVA (the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action). He received an honorary Doctorate in Literature from Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast in 1990. He is also a patron for the charity Over The Wall. He has also served on the Board of Governors of the British Film Institute. Branagh was the youngest actor to receive the Golden Quill (also known as the Gielgud Award) in 2000. In 2001, he was appointed an honorary Doctor of Literature at the Shakespeare Institute of The University of Birmingham; the Shakespeare Institute Library keeps the archive of his Renaissance Theatre Company and Renaissance Films.

On 10 July 2009, Branagh was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the RomaFictionFest. He was also listed on the &quot;Radio Times&#x27;s&quot; TV 100 power list in 2023.

He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to drama and to the community in Northern Ireland. He received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 9 November 2012; afterwards, Branagh told a BBC reporter that he felt &quot;humble, elated, and incredibly lucky&quot; to be knighted.

In October 2015, it was announced that Branagh would be the new President of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), succeeding the late Richard, Lord Attenborough. As the President of RADA and one of the highest profile actors and filmmakers in contemporary British popular culture, Branagh appeared on Debrett&#x27;s 2017 list of the most influential people in the UK. In October 2017, it was announced that Branagh would be conferred with the Freedom of the City of Belfast. The honour was officially conferred on him by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Councillor Nuala McAllister, at a ceremony in the Ulster Hall in Belfast on 30 January 2018. He was awarded the Freedom of the Town of Stratford-upon-Avon on 22 April 2022. Branagh stepped down as president of RADA in February 2024 and was succeeded by David Harewood.

<doc id="101408" wikidata="Q1393651" url="?curid=101408" title="Hamlet (2000 film)">
<text>Hamlet, also known as Hamlet 2000, is a 2000 American drama film written and directed by Michael Almereyda, set in contemporary New York City, and based on the Shakespeare play of the same name. Ethan Hawke plays Hamlet as a film student, Kyle MacLachlan co-stars as Uncle Claudius, with Diane Venora as Gertrude, Liev Schreiber as Laertes, Julia Stiles as Ophelia, Steve Zahn as Rosencrantz, Bill Murray as Polonius, and Sam Shepard as Hamlet&#x27;s father.

In this version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Claudius is the CEO or &quot;king&quot; of the Denmark Corporation, having taken over the firm by killing his brother, Hamlet&#x27;s father.

This adaptation keeps the Shakespearean dialogue but presents a modern setting, with technology such as video cameras, Polaroid cameras, and surveillance bugs. For example, the ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s murdered father first appears on closed-circuit TV.

==Adaptations==
*Elsinore Castle, the seat of power of Denmark&#x27;s crown in the play, is re-imagined as Hotel Elsinore, the headquarters of Denmark Corporation.
*Prior to delivering the &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; monologue, Hamlet is seen watching a video of famed Buddhist teacher Thích Nhất Hạnh explaining the principle &quot;To be is to be with others; to be is to inter-be&quot; a basic teaching of Hanh&#x27;s &quot;Order of Interbeing&quot;.
*The &quot;Mousetrap&quot; play takes the form of a video art montage, edited by Hamlet himself.
*Instead of a Tapestry, Polonius hides in Gertrude&#x27;s closet, then Hamlet shoots him through the door. 
*The character of Marcellus, one of the soldiers, is re-imagined as Marcella, Horatio&#x27;s girlfriend.
*The Captain in Fortinbras&#x27; army is replaced by a flight attendant on Hamlet&#x27;s flight to England.
*Instead of carrying around actual flowers, Ophelia carries polaroid photographs of various flowers. In the film, Ophelia is an amateur photographer.
*Fortinbras&#x27; conquests are not military but corporate takeovers with the aid of his &quot;armies&quot; of lawyers.
*As opposed to drowning in a brook, Ophelia is found to have drowned in a fountain in front of the Hotel Elsinore, surrounded by mementos of her relationship with Hamlet.
*The Ghost of King Hamlet appears in Horatio&#x27;s apartment, sitting in his bedroom as Marcella sleeps before Hamlet and Horatio enter it.
*The first intervention of Osric is re-imagined as a fax machine in Hamlet and Horatio&#x27;s apartment, delivering Laertes&#x27; message right before the duel. However, Osric does appear during the duel between Hamlet and Laertes.
*Though Hamlet and Laertes still fence, Laertes does not kill Hamlet with a poisoned rapier (or here, foil). Instead, he shoots Hamlet with a pistol, then is shot himself. Hamlet then uses the same pistol to shoot and kill Claudius.

==Cast==

*Ethan Hawke as Hamlet
*Kyle MacLachlan as Claudius
*Diane Venora as Gertrude
*Sam Shepard as Ghost
*Liev Schreiber as Laertes
*Julia Stiles as Ophelia
*Bill Murray as Polonius
*Karl Geary as Horatio
*Paula Malcomson as Marcella
*Steve Zahn as Rosencrantz
*Dechen Thurman as Guildenstern
*Rome Neal as Barnardo
*Jeffrey Wright as Gravedigger
*Paul Bartel as Osric
*Casey Affleck as Fortinbras
*Robert Thurman as Priest
*Tim Blake Nelson as Flight captain
*Larry Fessenden as Kissing Man
==Reception==
 Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 70/100, based on 32 reviews from mainstream critics.

Film critic Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded it as a &quot;vital and sharply intelligent film,&quot; while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reviewer deemed it as a &quot;darkly interesting distraction but not much more.&quot; The reaction to Hawke&#x27;s performance as the title role is also mixed. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described him as a &quot;superb Prince of Denmark - youthful, sensitive, passionate but with a mature grasp of the workings of human nature.&quot; &quot;New York&quot; magazine, however, thought Hawke&#x27;s performance was only &quot;middling.&quot;

*&quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; and &quot;O&quot; - contemporary adaptations of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot;, respectively, both also featuring Julia Stiles.

<text>Arrian of Nicomedia (; Greek: &quot;Arrianos&quot;; ; ) was a Greek historian, public servant, military commander, and philosopher of the Roman period.

&quot;The Anabasis of Alexander&quot; by Arrian is considered the best source on the campaigns of Alexander the Great. Scholars have generally preferred Arrian to other extant primary sources, though this attitude has changed somewhat in light of modern studies into Arrian&#x27;s method.

== Arrian&#x27;s life ==
Arrian was born in Nicomedia (present-day İzmit), the provincial capital of Bithynia. Cassius Dio called him Flavius Arrianus Nicomediensis. Sources provide similar dates for his birth, within a few years prior to 90, 89, and 85–90 AD. The line of reasoning for dates belonging to 85–90 AD is because of Arrian being made a consul around 130 AD, and the usual age for this, during this period, being 42 years of age. (ref. pp. 312, &amp; SYME 1958, &quot;ibid.&quot;). His family was from the Greek provincial aristocracy, and his full name, &quot;L. Flavius Arrianus&quot;, indicates that he was a Roman citizen, suggesting that the citizenship went back several generations, probably to the time of the Roman conquest some 170 years before.

Sometime during the second century AD (117 to 120 AD) while in Epirus, probably Nicopolis, Arrian attended lectures of Epictetus of Nicopolis, and proceeded within a time to fall into his pupillage, a fact attested to by Lucian. All that is known about the life of Epictetus is due to Arrian, in that Arrian left an &quot;Encheiridion&quot; (&quot;Handbook&quot;) of Epictetus&#x27; philosophy. After Epirus, he went to Athens, and while there, he became known as the &quot;young Xenophon&quot; as a consequence of the similarity of his relationship to Epictetus as Xenophon had to Socrates.

For a period, some time about 126 AD, he was a friend of the emperor Hadrian&#x27;s, who appointed him to the Senate. He was appointed to the position &quot;consul suffectus&quot; around 130 AD, and then, in 132 AD (although Howatson shows 131), he was made prefect or legate (governor) of Cappadocia by Hadrian, a service he continued for six years. Historian Cassius Dio states that not long after the Bar Kokhba revolt in Judea had been quelled, in 135 AD, King Pharasmanes II of Iberia caused the Alani to invade neighbouring territories, including Cappadocia, where their advance was robustly halted by Arrian&#x27;s legions.

A second war was begun by the Alani (they are Massagetae) at the instigation of Pharasmanes. It caused dire injury to the Albanian territory and Media, and then involved Armenia and Cappadocia; after which, as the Alani were not only persuaded by gifts from Vologaesus, but also stood in dread of Flavius Arrianus, the governor of Cappadocia, it came to a stop.

Arrian referred to himself as &quot;the second Xenophon&quot;, on account of his reputation and the esteem in which he was held. Lucian stated him to be:

This quality is identified as &quot;paideia&quot; (παιδεία), which is the quality considered to be of one who is known as an educated and learned personage, i.e., one who is highly esteemed and important.

== Works ==

He produced eight extant works (cf. Syvänne, footnote of p. 260). The &quot;Indica&quot; and the &quot;Anabasis&quot; are the only works completely intact. His entire remaining &quot;oeuvre&quot; is known as &quot;FGrH 156&quot; to designate those collected fragments that exist.

=== &quot;Periplus of the Euxine Sea&quot; ===
This work is the earliest extant work that is dated with any confidence. It is a writing addressed to Emperor Hadrian.

=== &quot;Discourses of Epictetus&quot; and &quot;Enchiridion of Epictetus&quot; ===

Arrian was a pupil of Epictetus around 108 AD, and, according to his own account, he was moved to publish his notes of Epictetus&#x27; lectures, which are known as &quot;Discourses of Epictetus&quot;, by their unauthorized dissemination. According to George Long, Arrian noted from Epictetus&#x27; lectures for his private use and some time later made of these, the &quot;Discourses&quot;. Photius states that Arrian produced two books the &quot;Dissertations&quot; and the &quot;Discourses&quot;. The Discourses are also known as &quot;Diatribai&quot; and are apparently a verbatim recording of Epictetus&#x27; lectures.

The &quot;Enchiridion&quot; is a short compendium of all Epictetus&#x27; philosophical principles. It is also known as a handbook, and A Mehl considers the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; to have been a &quot;&quot; for Arrian. The &quot;Enchiridion&quot; is apparently a summary of the Discourses.

JB Stockdale considered that Arrian wrote eight books of which and the remaining ones became the &quot;Discourses&quot;. In a comparison of the contents of the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; with the &quot;Discourses&quot;, it is apparent that the former contains material not present within the latter, suggesting an original lost source for the &quot;Enchiridion&quot;.

=== &quot;Homiliai Epiktetou&quot; ===
&quot;Friendly conversations with Epictetus&quot; (&quot;Homiliai Epiktetou&quot;) is a 12 book work mentioned by Photius in his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, of which only fragments remain.

=== &quot;Anabasis of Alexander&quot; ===
The &quot;Anabasis of Alexander&quot; comprises seven books. Arrian used Xenophon&#x27;s account of the March of Cyrus as the basis for this work.

=== &quot;Ta met&#x27; Alexandron&quot; ===
&quot;History of the Diadochi&quot; or &quot;Events after Alexander&quot; is a work originally of ten books; a commentary on this work was written by Photius (FW Walbank, p. 8).

Three extant fragments are the &quot;Vatican Palimpsest&quot; (of the 10th century AD), PSI 12.1284 (Oxyrhynchus), and the &quot;Gothenburg palimpsest&quot; (of the 10th century also), these possibly stemming originally from Photius.

The writing is about the successors of Alexander the Great, circa 323 – 321 or 319.

=== &quot;Parthica&quot; ===
A lost work of seventeen books, fragments of &quot;Parthica&quot; were maintained by the Suda and Stephanus of Byzantium. The work survives only in adaptations made later by Photius and Syncellus. Translated, the title is &quot;History of the Parthians&quot;. Arrian&#x27;s aim in the work was to set forth events of the Parthian war of Trajan. The writing mentioned that the Parthians trace their origins to Artaxerxes II.

=== &quot;Bithyniaca&quot; ===
A work of eight books, &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; (via Photius) states it is the fourth to have been written by Arrian.

=== &quot;Nicomediensis Scripta minora&quot; ===
A work translated &quot;a Nicodemian script (minor)&quot;.

=== &quot;Indica&quot; ===

&quot;Indica&quot; is a work on a variety of things pertaining to India, and the voyage of Nearchus in the Persian Gulf. The first part of &quot;Indica&quot; was based largely on the work of the same name of Megasthenes, the second part based on a journal written by Nearchus.

=== &quot;Techne Taktike&quot; ===
Written 136/137 AD (in the 20th year of Hadrian), &quot;Techne Taktike&quot; (&#x27;the art/craft of tactics&#x27;) is a treatise on Roman cavalry and military tactics, and includes information on the nature, arms and discipline of the phalanx. The &quot;hippika gymnasia&quot; is a particular concern of Arrian in the treatise.

Another translation of the title is &quot;Ars tactica&quot;, which, in Greek, is Τέχνη τακτική.

This work has generally been considered in large part a panegyric to Hadrian, written for the occasion of his &quot;vīcennālia&quot;, although some scholars have argued that its second half may have had practical use.

=== &quot;Kynēgetikos&quot; ===
&quot;Cynegeticus&quot; (Κυνηγετικός), translated as &quot;A treatise on hunting with hounds&quot;, &quot;On Hunting&quot;, or &quot;On Coursing&quot;, is a work about the Celtic sport of coursing hare with sighthounds, specifically the Celtic greyhounds: in Greek (plural) &quot;ouertragoi&quot;, in Latin (plural) &quot;vertragi&quot;.

The work was inspired by and designed as an addition to an earlier exposition made by Xenophon, whom Arrian recognised to be the Ancient Greek authority on the subject of hunting with scent hounds.

=== &quot;Ektaxis kata Alanon&quot; ===
&quot;Ektaxis kata Alanon&quot; (Ἔκταξις κατὰ Ἀλανῶν) is a work of a now fragmentary nature; the title is translated as &quot;Deployment against the Alani&quot; or &quot;The order of battle against the Alans&quot; or referred to simply as &quot;Alanica&quot;. It is thought not have been written as a presentation of facts but for literary reasons. Pertaining to the relevant historical facts, though, while governor of Cappadocia, Arrian repelled an invasion of the Alani sometime during 135 AD, a struggle in which Arrian&#x27;s two legions were victorious.

Within the work, Arrian explicitly identified the particular means of pursuing warfare as being based on Greek methods.

&quot;Ektaxis kata Alanon&quot; is also translated as &quot;Acies contra Alanos&quot;. The work was known for a time as &quot;A History of the Alani&quot; (&quot;Alanike&quot; via Photius). A fragment describing a plan of battle against the Alani was found in Milan around the 17th century which was thought at that time to belong to the &quot;History&quot;.

=== Biographical series ===

There were also a number of monographs or biographies, including of Dion of Syracuse, Timoleon of Corinth, and Tilliborus, a brigand or robber of Asia Minor, which are now lost.

== Sources, transmission, translations and publications ==
Everything known of his life derives from the 9th century writing of Photius in his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, and from those few references which exist within Arrian&#x27;s own writings. The knowledge of his consulship, is derived at the least from literature produced by Suidas. Arnobius (c. 3rd century AD) mentions Arrian. Arrian was also known of by Aulus Gellius. Pliny the Younger addressed seven of his epistles to him. Simplicius made a copy of the Enchiridion, which was transmitted under the name of the monastic father Nilus during the 5th century, and as a result found in every monastery library.

Nicholas Blancard made translations of Arrian in 1663 and 1668.

The voyage of Nearchus and &quot;Periplus of the Erythrean Sea&quot; were translated from the Greek by the then Dean of Westminster, William Vincent, and published in 1809. Vincent published a commentary in 1797 on &quot;The voyage of Nearchus&quot;. The work was also translated into French by M. Billecocq, under the auspices of the government (cf. p. 321).

<text>Nearchus or Nearchos (; – 300 BC) was one of the Greek officers, a navarch, in the army of Alexander the Great. He is known for his celebrated expeditionary voyage starting from the Indus River, through the Persian Gulf and ending at the mouth of the Tigris River following the Indian campaign of Alexander the Great, in 326–324 BC.

==Early life==
A native of Lato in Crete and son of Androtimus, his family settled at Amphipolis in Macedonia at some point during Philip II&#x27;s reign (we must assume after Philip took the city in 357 BC), at which point Nearchus was probably a young boy. He was almost certainly older than Alexander, as were Ptolemy, Erigyius, and the others of the ‘boyhood friends’; so depending on when Androtimus came to Macedonia Nearchus was quite possibly born in Crete. Nearchus, along with Ptolemy, Erigyius and Laomedon, and Harpalus, was one of Alexander&#x27;s ‘mentors’ – and he was exiled by Philip as a result of the Pixodarus affair (A 3.6.5; P 10.3). It is not known where the exiles went, but they were recalled only after Philip&#x27;s death, on Alexander&#x27;s accession.

== Conquests of Alexander the Great ==
After their recall, these men were held in the highest honour. Nearchus was appointed as satrap of Lycia and Pamphylia in 334/3 BC (A 3.3.6), one of the earliest of Alexander&#x27;s satrapal appointments. Nearchus&#x27; naval blockade of Persian fleets threatening the Aegean Sea was successful in aiding Alexander&#x27;s conquest of Phoenicia, Egypt and Babylonia. In 328 BC he was relieved of his post and rejoined Alexander in Bactria (northern Afghanistan), bringing with him reinforcements (A 4.7.2; C 7.10.4, but does not mention Nearchus himself). After the siege of Aornos in present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, Nearchus was sent at the head of a reconnaissance mission – especially to find out about elephants (A 4.30.5–6).

== Indus River Voyage ==
In 326 BC, Nearchus was made admiral of the fleet that Alexander had constructed at the Hydaspes (A 6.2.3; &quot;Indica&quot; 18.10). However, his trierarchy was a financial responsibility – that is, Nearchus put up the money for the boats (Heckel, p.229); and there were plenty of other trierarchs in the Indus fleet who were not natural-born sailors. Strabo recounts that the Himalayan range of Emodus was close to the construction of the fleet near Taxila, providing ample supplies of fir, pine and cedar timber. Initially, the fleet progressed down the Hydaspes much like a triumphal military parade, accompanied by a land-based entourage of the main armed forces of Alexander including cavalry, elephants and loot trains. At the confluence of the Acesines and Indus Rivers, Alexander founded a city called Alexandria-on-the-Indus, assigning it to the satrapy of Oxyartes (father of Roxana) and populating it with Thracian troops.

Some of the ships were damaged, and Nearchus was instructed to remain behind to oversee repairs, before continuing down the river. This perhaps indicates some knowledge of shipbuilding, but he could hardly have been the only one qualified. The voyage down the Indus River lasted from 326 to 325 BCE and resulted in the capture of native Indian towns. By the time the Macedonians had reached Pattala (modern Bahmanabad in Sindh, Pakistan), Nearchus prepared to lead 17–20,000 men for an expedition into the Persian Gulf, while Alexander continue through the Gedrosian desert. Nearchus was not the only Greek naval officer to have pursued a voyage down the Indus River—this was also done by Scylax of Caryanda under the commission of Darius the Great, according to Herodotus.

Nearchus remained in command of the fleet for the voyage from the Indus to the Persian Gulf, which he recorded in detail (and which was used extensively for Arrian’s &quot;Indica&quot;). Again, although he was the admiral, in command of the fleet, great seamanship was not required – the naval responsibilities were Onesicritus’. Nearchus compiled the story of his expedition into a written work—the &quot;Indike&quot;—which is now lost but informs some of the content in Arrian&#x27;s &quot;Indica&quot; and Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica.&quot; This work likely consisted of two parts: one detailing India&#x27;s frontiers, size, population, castes, fauna, flora, cultures and militaries, and the other describing his home-bound voyage toward Babylon. Nearchus described, according to Arrian, how commodities like rice, sugarcane and cotton fabrics and textiles were cultivated, manufactured and traded in the Indus Valley.

== Persian Gulf Voyage ==

Nearchus began by setting out from Patala, although monsoon rains and heavy winds delayed his reaching the Arabian Sea. To wait out the adverse weather, the Macedonian fleet camped near the mouth of the Indus and Arabius Rivers, building stone walls as fortification against hostile natives and subsisting off of briny water, mussels, oysters and razor-fish. After 24 days, Nearchus continued on to the harbor of Morontobara (Manora Island just off the coast of modern Karachi, Pakistan). About Morontobara, Arrian writes:

: Then making their way through two rocks, so close together that the oar-blades of the ships touched the rocks to port and starboard, they moored at Morontobara, after sailing some three hundred stades. The harbour is spacious, circular, deep, and calm, but its entrance is narrow. They called it, in the natives&#x27; language, &#x27;The Ladies&#x27; Pool,&#x27; since a lady was the first sovereign of this district. When they had got safe through the rocks, they met great waves, and the sea running strong; and moreover it seemed very hazardous to sail seaward of the cliffs. For the next day, however, they sailed with an island on their port beam, so as to break the sea, so close indeed to the beach that one would have conjectured that it was a channel cut between the island and the coast. The entire passage was of some seventy stades. On the beach were many thick trees, and the island was wholly covered with shady forest. About dawn, they sailed outside the island, by a narrow and turbulent passage; for the tide was still falling. And when they had sailed some hundred and twenty stades they anchored in the mouth of the river Arabis. There was a fine large harbour by its mouth; but there was no drinking water; for the mouths of the Arabis were mixed with sea-water. However, after penetrating forty stades inland they found a water-hole, and after drawing water thence they returned back again. By the harbour was a high island, desert, and round it one could get oysters and all kinds of fish. Up to this the country of the Arabians extends; they are the last Indians settled in this direction; from here on the territory, of the Oreitans begins.
At Morontobara, Leonnatus (one of Alexander&#x27;s Generals) had defeated the local Oreitans and deposited a food supply from which Nearchus&#x27; fleet subsisted. Resupplied, Nearchus reached the Hingol River (in Makran, Balochistan) and destroyed the native population. Nearchus had arrived at the country of the Icthyophagoi -- &#x27;Fish-Eaters&#x27; -- who inhabited the barren coastal region of Makran, between the Arabian Sea and the Gedrosian Desert and found the harbor of Bagisara (modern Ormara Port).

In the next stage of the expedition, Nearchus and his fleet sheltered first at Colta, then Calima (Kalat), Carnine (Astola Island), Cysa and Mosarna. At Mosarna, a Gedrosian sailor joined their fleet and directed them to Gwadar, where they found date-palms and gardens. They ransacked the city of Chah-Bahar and anchored the fleet at a promontory dedicated to the Sun God, called Bageia. Nearchus continued on to the Persian Gulf at the Straits of Hormuz. After many adventures, Nearchus arrived in Carmania in Southern Iran, meeting up with Alexander after the latter&#x27;s crossing of the Gedrosian desert. Here they noted that the area was well-cultivated with corn (grain), vines and trees (apart from the olive tree cherished by Greeks). At the Straits of Hormuz, Nearchus and Onesicritus saw the peninsula of Oman in Arabia, but did not venture there. Oman was a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire before Alexander&#x27;s conquest.
During the voyage, Nearchus was reputedly the first Greek commander to visit Bahrain, which was called Tylos by the Greeks. His visit marked the start of Bahrain&#x27;s inclusion within the Hellenic world, which culminated in the worship of Zeus (as the Arab sun god, Shams) and Greek being spoken as the language of the upper classes. Bahrain even hosted Greek athletic contests. Nearchus recorded that Bahrain was a prosperous commercial island, stating: &quot;That in the island of Tylos, situated in the Persian Gulf, are large plantations of cotton tree, from which are manufactured clothes called &quot;sindones&quot;, a very different degrees of value, some being costly, others less expensive. The use of these is not confined to India, but extends to Arabia.&quot;The Macedonians visited many ports in the Persian Gulf such as Harmozeia, Qeshm Island, Cape Ra&#x27;s-e Bostâneh, Qeys Island, Band-e Nakhîlû, Lâzeh Island (where they encountered pearl-hunters), the Bandar-e Shîû promontory, Nây Band, Kangan, the Mand River, Bûsher, the Dasht-e Palang River, Jazireh-ye Shîf and the Marun River. They finally reached the mouth of the Tigris River in 324 BCE.

After reaching the Tigris River, Nearchus went as far as the Euphrates before turning back to rejoin Alexander at Susa, in early 324 BC. He and Onesicritus received a golden diadem for their actions. Nearchus married the daughter of Barsine and Mentor (A 7.4.6), and received a crown as recognition of his exertions (A 7.5.6). He then took the fleet up to Babylon, where he gave Alexander the Chaldeans’ warning not to enter the city (P 73.1–2).

== Later life ==
Nearchus had a place in Alexander&#x27;s final plans, as he was to be the admiral of the fleet to conquer Arabia, a land Alexander wished to conquer to fortify trade and transportation in the Persian Gulf between Babylon and India. These plans were cut short by the king&#x27;s death.

In the initial arguments over the rule of the empire Nearchus supported Heracles, Alexander&#x27;s son by Barsine – the king&#x27;s mistress was now his mother-in-law. Once order broke down he joined Antigonus&#x27; camp. His last mention is as an adviser to Demetrius in 313/2 BC (D 19.69.1); what happened after that is not known, although he probably retired to write his history. Nearchus wrote a history of his voyages together with a description of India entitled &quot;Indica&quot;. This text is now lost, but its contents are known from information included by Strabo and other later authors. An account of his voyage is given in Arrian&#x27;s own &quot;Indica&quot;, written in the 2nd century AD. Pliny the Elder wrote that Nearchus founded the town of Arbis during his voyage.

== Legacy ==
The Hellenic navy named in 1980 a Fletcher class destroyer under the name of the navarch (D-65). Later on in 1992 the Hellenic navy named the second C.F Adams destroyer Nearchus ( D-219). In 27 September 2022 the hellenic navy announced that the second FDI frigate will be named Nearchus as well.

<text>Shotgun debugging can be defined as:
*A process of making relatively un-directed changes to software in the hope that a bug will be perturbed out of existence.
* Using the approach of trying several possible solutions of hardware or software problem at the same time, in the hope that one of the solutions (typically source code modifications) will work.

&quot;Shotgun debugging&quot; has a relatively low success rate and can be very time-consuming, except when used as an attempt to work around programming language features that one may be using improperly. When combined with domain expertise and a strong intuition for the underlying codebase, it can be a good starting point to gut-solve a buggy piece of code a few times before formally researching the corresponding error message. When used in this way, it may be a valuable technique that is faster than browsing through the Internet searching a particular error message every time.

== Examples ==
Shotgun debugging can occur when working with multi-threaded applications. Attempting to debug a race condition by adding debugging code to the application is likely to change the speed of one thread in relation to another and could cause the problem to disappear. This is known as a Heisenbug. Although apparently a solution to the problem, it is a fix by pure chance and anything else that changes the behavior of the threads could cause it to resurface — for example on a computer with a different scheduler. Code added to any part of the program could easily revert the effect of the &quot;fix&quot;.

<text>A virtual local area network (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). In this context, virtual refers to a physical object recreated and altered by additional logic, within the local area network. Basically, a VLAN behaves like a virtual switch or network link that can share the same physical structure with other VLANs while staying logically separate from them. VLANs work by applying tags to network frames and handling these tags in networking systems, in effect creating the appearance and functionality of network traffic that, while on a single physical network, behaves as if it were split between separate networks. In this way, VLANs can keep network applications separate despite being connected to the same physical network, and without requiring multiple sets of cabling and networking devices to be deployed.

VLANs allow network administrators to group hosts together even if the hosts are not directly connected to the same network switch. Because VLAN membership can be configured through software, this can greatly simplify network design and deployment. Without VLANs, grouping hosts according to their resource needs the labor of relocating nodes or rewiring data links. VLANs allow devices that must be kept separate to share the cabling of a physical network and yet be prevented from directly interacting with one another. This managed sharing yields gains in simplicity, security, traffic management, and economy. For example, a VLAN can be used to separate traffic within a business based on individual users or groups of users or their roles (e.g. network administrators), or based on traffic characteristics (e.g. low-priority traffic prevented from impinging on the rest of the network&#x27;s functioning). Many Internet hosting services use VLANs to separate customers&#x27; private zones from one other, allowing each customer&#x27;s servers to be grouped in a single network segment no matter where the individual servers are located in the data center. Some precautions are needed to prevent traffic &quot;escaping&quot; from a given VLAN, an exploit known as VLAN hopping.

To subdivide a network into VLANs, one configures network equipment. Simpler equipment might partition only each physical port (if even that), in which case each VLAN runs over a dedicated network cable. More sophisticated devices can mark frames through VLAN tagging, so that a single interconnect (&quot;trunk&quot;) may be used to transport data for multiple VLANs. Since VLANs share bandwidth, a VLAN trunk can use link aggregation, quality-of-service prioritization, or both to route data efficiently.

==Uses==
VLANs address issues such as scalability, security, and network management. Network architects set up VLANs to provide network segmentation. Routers between VLANs filter broadcast traffic, enhance network security, perform address summarization, and mitigate network congestion.

In a network utilizing broadcasts for service discovery, address assignment and resolution and other services, as the number of peers on a network grows, the frequency of broadcasts also increases. VLANs can help manage broadcast traffic by forming multiple broadcast domains. Breaking up a large network into smaller independent segments reduces the amount of broadcast traffic each network device and network segment has to bear. Switches may not bridge network traffic between VLANs, as doing so would violate the integrity of the VLAN broadcast domain.

VLANs can also help create multiple layer 3 networks on a single physical infrastructure. VLANs are data link layer (OSI layer 2) constructs, analogous to Internet Protocol (IP) subnets, which are network layer (OSI layer 3) constructs. In an environment employing VLANs, a one-to-one relationship often exists between VLANs and IP subnets, although it is possible to have multiple subnets on one VLAN.

Without VLAN capability, users are assigned to networks based on geography and are limited by physical topologies and distances. VLANs can logically group networks to decouple the users&#x27; network location from their physical location. By using VLANs, one can control traffic patterns and react quickly to employee or equipment relocations. VLANs provide the flexibility to adapt to changes in network requirements and allow for simplified administration.

VLANs can be used to partition a local network into several distinctive segments, for instance:
* Production
* Voice over IP
* Network management
* Storage area network (SAN)
* Guest Internet access
* Demilitarized zone (DMZ)

A common infrastructure shared across VLAN trunks can provide a measure of security with great flexibility for a comparatively low cost. Quality of service schemes can optimize traffic on trunk links for real-time (e.g. VoIP) or low-latency requirements (e.g. SAN). However, VLANs as a security solution should be implemented with great care as they can be defeated unless implemented carefully.

In cloud computing VLANs, IP addresses, and MAC addresses in the cloud are resources that end users can manage. To help mitigate security issues, placing cloud-based virtual machines on VLANs may be preferable to placing them directly on the Internet.

Network technologies with VLAN capabilities include:
* Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
* Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)
* Ethernet
* HiperSocket
* InfiniBand

== History ==
After successful experiments with voice over Ethernet from 1981 to 1984, W. David Sincoskie joined Bellcore and began addressing the problem of scaling up Ethernet networks. At 10 Mbit/s, Ethernet was faster than most alternatives at the time. However, Ethernet was a broadcast network and there was no good way of connecting multiple Ethernet networks together. This limited the total bandwidth of an Ethernet network to 10 Mbit/s and the maximum distance between nodes to a few hundred feet.

By contrast, although the existing telephone network&#x27;s speed for individual connections was limited to 56 kbit/s (less than one hundredth of Ethernet&#x27;s speed), the total bandwidth of that network was estimated at 1 Tbit/s (100,000 times greater than Ethernet).

Although it was possible to use IP routing to connect multiple Ethernet networks together, it was expensive and relatively slow. Sincoskie started looking for alternatives that required less processing per packet. In the process, he independently reinvented transparent bridging, the technique used in modern Ethernet switches. However, using switches to connect multiple Ethernet networks in a fault-tolerant fashion requires redundant paths through that network, which in turn requires a spanning tree configuration. This ensures that there is only one &quot;active&quot; path from any source node to any destination on the network. This causes centrally located switches to become bottlenecks, limiting scalability as more networks are interconnected.

To help alleviate this problem, Sincoskie invented VLANs by adding a tag to each Ethernet frame. These tags could be thought of as colors, say red, green, or blue. In this scheme, each switch could be assigned to handle frames of a single color, and ignore the rest. The networks could be interconnected with three spanning trees, one for each color. By sending a mix of different frame colors, the aggregate bandwidth could be improved. Sincoskie referred to this as a &quot;multitree bridge&quot;. He and Chase Cotton created and refined the algorithms necessary to make the system feasible. This &quot;color&quot; is what is now known in the Ethernet frame as the IEEE 802.1Q header, or the VLAN tag. While VLANs are commonly used in modern Ethernet networks, they are not used in the manner first envisioned here.

In 1998, Ethernet VLANs were described in the first edition of the IEEE 802.1Q-1998 standard. This was extended with IEEE 802.1ad to allow nested VLAN tags in service of provider bridging. This mechanism was improved with IEEE 802.1ah-2008.

==Configuration and design considerations==
Early network designers often segmented physical LANs with the aim of reducing the size of the Ethernet collision domain—thus improving performance. When Ethernet switches made this a non-issue (because each switch port is a collision domain), attention turned to reducing the size of the data link layer broadcast domain. VLANs were first employed to separate several broadcast domains across one physical medium. A VLAN can also serve to restrict access to network resources without regard to physical topology of the network.

VLANs operate at the data link layer of the OSI model. Administrators often configure a VLAN to map directly to an IP network, or subnet, which gives the appearance of involving the network layer. Generally, VLANs within the same organization will be assigned different non-overlapping network address ranges. This is not a requirement of VLANs. There is no issue with separate VLANs using identical overlapping address ranges (e.g. two VLANs each use the private network ). However, it is not possible to route data between two networks with overlapping addresses without delicate IP remapping, so if the goal of VLANs is segmentation of a larger overall organizational network, non-overlapping addresses must be used in each separate VLAN.

A basic switch that is not configured for VLANs has VLAN functionality disabled or permanently enabled with a &quot;default VLAN&quot; that contains all ports on the device as members. The default VLAN typically uses VLAN identifier 1. Every device connected to one of its ports can send packets to any of the others. Separating ports by VLAN groups separates their traffic very much like connecting each group using a distinct switch for each group.

Remote management of the switch requires that the administrative functions be associated with one or more of the configured VLANs.

In the context of VLANs, the term &quot;trunk&quot; denotes a network link carrying multiple VLANs, which are identified by labels (or &quot;tags&quot;) inserted into their packets. Such trunks must run between &quot;tagged ports&quot; of VLAN-aware devices, so they are often switch-to-switch or switch-to-router links rather than links to hosts. (Note that the term &#x27;trunk&#x27; is also used for what Cisco calls &quot;channels&quot; : Link Aggregation or Port Trunking). A router (Layer 3 device) serves as the backbone for network traffic going across different VLANs. It is only when the VLAN port group is to extend to another device that tagging is used. Since communications between ports on two different switches travel via the uplink ports of each switch involved, every VLAN containing such ports must also contain the uplink port of each switch involved, and traffic through these ports must be tagged.

Switches typically have no built-in method to indicate VLAN to port associations to someone working in a wiring closet. It is necessary for a technician to either have administrative access to the device to view its configuration, or for VLAN port assignment charts or diagrams to be kept next to the switches in each wiring closet.

==Protocols and design==
The protocol most commonly used today to support VLANs is IEEE 802.1Q. The IEEE 802.1 working group defined this method of multiplexing VLANs in an effort to provide multivendor VLAN support. Prior to the introduction of the 802.1Q standard, several proprietary protocols existed, such as Cisco Inter-Switch Link (ISL) and 3Com&#x27;s Virtual LAN Trunk (VLT). Cisco also implemented VLANs over FDDI by carrying VLAN information in an IEEE 802.10 frame header, contrary to the purpose of the IEEE 802.10 standard.

Both ISL and IEEE 802.1Q perform &quot;explicit tagging&quot; – the frame itself is tagged with VLAN identifiers. ISL uses an external tagging process that does not modify the Ethernet frame, while 802.1Q uses a frame-internal field for tagging, and therefore does modify the basic Ethernet frame structure. This internal tagging allows IEEE 802.1Q to work on both access and trunk links using standard Ethernet hardware.

===IEEE 802.1Q===

Under IEEE 802.1Q, the maximum number of VLANs on a given Ethernet network is 4,094 (4,096 values provided by the 12-bit field minus reserved values at each end of the range, 0 and 4,095). This does not impose the same limit on the number of IP subnets in such a network since a single VLAN can contain multiple IP subnets. IEEE 802.1ad extends the number of VLANs supported by adding support for multiple, nested VLAN tags. IEEE 802.1aq (Shortest Path Bridging) expands the VLAN limit to 16 million. Both improvements have been incorporated into the IEEE 802.1Q standard.

===Cisco Inter-Switch Link===

Inter-Switch Link (ISL) is a Cisco proprietary protocol used to interconnect switches and maintain VLAN information as traffic travels between switches on trunk links. ISL is provided as an alternative to IEEE 802.1Q. ISL is available only on some Cisco equipment and has been deprecated.

===Cisco VLAN Trunking Protocol===

VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) is a Cisco proprietary protocol that propagates the definition of VLANs on the whole local area network. VTP is available on most of the Cisco Catalyst Family products. The comparable IEEE standard in use by other manufacturers is GARP VLAN Registration Protocol (GVRP) or the more recent Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol (MVRP).

=== Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol ===

Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol is an application of Multiple Registration Protocol that allows automatic configuration of VLAN information on network switches. Specifically, it provides a method to dynamically share VLAN information and configure the needed VLANs.

==Membership==
VLAN membership can be established either statically or dynamically.

Static VLANs are also referred to as port-based VLANs. Static VLAN assignments are created by assigning ports to a VLAN. As a device enters the network, the device automatically assumes the VLAN of the port. If the user changes ports and needs access to the same VLAN, the network administrator must manually make a port-to-VLAN assignment for the new connection.

Dynamic VLANs are created using software or by protocol. With a VLAN Management Policy Server (VMPS), an administrator can assign switch ports to VLANs dynamically based on information such as the source MAC address of the device connected to the port or the username used to log onto that device. As a device enters the network, the switch queries a database for the VLAN membership of the port that device is connected to. Protocol methods include Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol (MVRP) and the somewhat obsolete GARP VLAN Registration Protocol (GVRP).

==Protocol-based VLANs==
In a switch that supports protocol-based VLANs, traffic may be handled on the basis of its protocol. Essentially, this segregates or forwards traffic from a port depending on the particular protocol of that traffic; traffic of any other protocol is not forwarded on the port. This allows, for example, IP and IPX traffic to be automatically segregated by the network.

==VLAN cross connect==
VLAN cross connect (CC or VLAN-XC) is a mechanism used to create Switched VLANs, VLAN CC uses IEEE 802.1ad frames where the S Tag is used as a Label as in MPLS. IEEE approves the use of such a mechanism in part 6.11 of IEEE 802.1ad-2005.

<doc id="101419" wikidata="Q80866" url="?curid=101419" title="Marabout">
<text>In the Muslim world, the marabout () is a descendant of Muhammad (Arabic: سـيّد, romanized: &quot;sayyid&quot; and &quot;sidi&quot; in the Maghreb) and a Muslim religious leader and teacher who historically had the function of a chaplain serving as a part of an Islamic army, notably in North Africa and the Sahara region, in West Africa, and historically in the Maghreb.

The marabout is often a scholar of the Quran, or religious teacher. Others may be wandering holy men who survive on alms or as spiritual directors of Muslim religious communities, often as &quot;muršid&quot; (&quot;guide&quot;) of Sufi orders. The term &quot;marabout&quot; is also used for the mausolea of such religious leaders (cf. &quot;maqām&quot;, &quot;mazār&quot;, in Palestine also &quot;walī/velī&quot;).

==West Africa==
===Muslim religious teachers===
Muslim Sufi brotherhoods were one of the main organizing forms of Islam in precolonial West Africa, and with the spread of Sufism into the area, the marabout&#x27;s role combined with local practices throughout Senegambia, the Niger River Valley, and the Futa Jallon. Here, Sufi Muslim believers follow a marabout, elsewhere known as a &quot;muršid&quot; (&quot;guide&quot;). The term &quot;marabout&quot; was also adopted by French colonial officials, and applied to most any imam, Muslim teacher, or secular leader who appealed to the Islamic tradition.

Today marabouts can be traveling holy men men who survive on alms, religious teachers who take in young talibes at Quranic schools, or distinguished Muslim religious leaders and scholars, both in and out of the Sufi brotherhoods which dominate the Islamic spiritual life in Senegambia.

In the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, marabouts are organized in elaborate hierarchies; the highest marabout of the Mourides, for example, has been elevated to the status of a &quot;caliph&quot; or &quot;ruler of the faithful&quot; (&quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin&quot;). Older, North African-based Sufi brotherhoods such as the Tijaniyyah and the Qadiriyyah base their structures on respect for teachers and religious leaders who, south of the Sahara, often are called &quot;marabouts&quot;. Those who devote themselves to prayer or study, either based in communities, religious centers, or wandering in the larger society, are named &quot;marabouts&quot;. In Senegal and Mali, these marabouts rely on donations to live. Often there is a traditional bond to support a specific marabout that has accumulated over generations within a family. Marabouts normally dress in traditional West African robes and live a simple, ascetic life.

===Syncretic spiritualists===
The spread in sub-Saharan Africa of the marabout&#x27;s role from the 8th through 13th centuries created in some places a mixture of roles with pre-Islamic priests, local healers, and diviners. Thus, many fortune tellers and self-styled spiritual guides take the name &quot;marabout&quot;, something rejected by more orthodox Muslims and Sufi brotherhoods alike. The recent diaspora of West Africans (to Paris in particular) has brought this tradition to Europe and North America, where some marabouts advertise their services as fortune tellers. An eshu of Quimbanda, Marabô, is believed to have carried this esoteric and shamanic role into Brazil. Contemporary marabouts in Senegal advertise on television and have hot lines.

===Political influence===
====Pre-French colonization====
Marabouts have been prominent members of Wolof society since the arrival of Sufi brotherhoods from the Maghreb in the 15th century. Their advanced knowledge of the Quran and esteemed reputation have often allowed them to act as traders, priests, judges, or magicians in conjunction with their roles of community religious leaders. Additionally, because of their ability to read and write, village chiefs would frequently appoint marabouts as secretaries or advisers as a means to communicate with neighboring rulers.

The marabouts&#x27; expanding influence in politics paired with their unique allegiance of the Muslim community eventually posed a real threat to the chiefs who had appointed them. In 1683, rising tensions between chiefs and the Muslim population led to a Muslim revolt in the Wolof kingdom of &quot;Cayor&quot;, which concluded with the installation of a marabout as &quot;Damel&quot;. In the years following the revolt, relations between marabouts and Wolof chiefs remained relatively calm until a period of militant Islam in the Wolof states in the middle of the 19th century. Militant marabouts primarily of Tukulor(l origin, called &quot;warrior marabouts,&quot; completely rejected the authority of local chiefs and sought to install a theocratic Muslim state. As the authority of chiefs and royal armies were undermined by propaganda and military force used by the warrior marabouts, Muslim resistors turned to local marabouts for guidance and protection from their oppressors. After three decades of war and conflict, the warrior marabouts were gradually ousted from the Wolof states as French colonists began to take a tighter hold on the region. As confidence in the leadership abilities of chiefs and rulers declined as a result of the conflict, marabouts emerged as the most trusted and revered source of leadership in Wolof communities.

====Post-French colonization====
French colonizers had difficulties adjusting to ruling over Muslim societies. Particularly in West Africa, constructing institutions of colonial rule that did not favor certain constituencies while neglecting others proved to be a tricky task. The French opted for forms of indirect rule through the local aristocracy in an effort to maintain order and keep administrative costs down, but found that many subjects detested these colonial chiefs and rulers and tended to gravitate towards their local marabouts. Marabouts were admired for their transparency and righteousness as they were known to renounce political powers, while ensuring economic, social, and religious stability within their communities. Since the judgment of marabouts is so influential, the success or failure of a politician would be almost entirely contingent on the support of more prominent marabouts. Because of this, politicians would try to appease marabouts by agreeing to promote their Sufi brotherhood&#x27;s best interests in turn for their endorsement, with some politicians believing that winning an election would be impossible without the support of a marabout. This political dynamic, based on patronage and exchanges, would lead to a somewhat of an alliance between marabouts and the French colonizers. Along with endorsing certain politicians in exchange for favors, French colonial administrators sought out marabouts and heads of Sufi brotherhoods to act as intermediaries between colonial administrators and West African Muslims to ensure appropriate allocation of power and resources to avoid any potential conflict.

====Post-independence====
After Senegal gained its independence from France in 1960, marabouts and leaders of Sufi Brotherhoods (also marabouts), or the &quot;Khalife-Général&quot;, have continued to play influential roles in Senegalese politics. Some have questioned the utility of having clientelist relationships between marabouts and government officials in a modern democracy. The new &quot;grandson&quot; generation of marabouts has cultivated a more independent and secular political outlook and have proven that they are willing to question the authority of their predecessors. In Senegal&#x27;s 1988 presidential election, &quot;Khalife-Général&quot; Abdou Lahatte Mbakke supported Abdou Diouf for reelection. Both as public endorsement and as a reward for installing new roads and street lamps in Touba while in office, the &quot;Khalife-Général&quot; declared a &quot;ndiggël&quot; (a binding command issued by the &quot;Khalife-Général&quot; to all members of the Mouride Brotherhood) that proclaimed that all men must vote for Diouf. Although multiple &quot;Khalife-Général&quot; have issued &quot;&#x27;ndiggël politique&quot;&#x27; in support of a presidential candidate in previous elections, several marabouts of the &quot;grandson&quot; generation openly rejected the command by voting for the opposition instead. These marabouts believed that the &quot;ndiggël&quot; violated their secular political rights, which was a sentiment shared among many other Mourides in Touba.

In 1997, a rural council of Touba Mosquée in Senegal issued a set of new taxes meant to fund an ambitions development project in the holy city. City merchants promptly voiced their displeasure of the new taxes and threatened to kick the rural council, whose members were all appointed by the Mouride &quot;Khalife-Général,&quot; out of the city. Although tax revolts are not uncommon elsewhere, this incident was particularly noteworthy as the merchants&#x27; blatant refusal exhibited a departure from typical state-society relations in Senegal. Declining economic performance in Senegal may lead to more taxes in the future, which means political actors may have to adjust or fundamentally alter their clientelist relationships with marabouts and &quot;Khalife-Général&quot;.

==Maghreb==
The term marabout appears during the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. It is derived from the Arabic &quot;murābiṭ&quot; &quot;one who is garrisoned&quot;: religious students and military volunteers who manned ribats at the time of the conquest. Today, marabout means &quot;saint&quot; in the Berber languages and in general refers to Sufi Muslim teachers who head a lodge or school called a zāwiya associated with a specific school or tradition, called a &quot;way, path&quot; (). However, Charles de Foucauld and Albert Peyriguère, both living as Catholic hermits among Berbers in the Maghreb, were called marabouts by the local population due to their saintly lives.

The pronunciation of that word varies by language. For example, it is pronounced &quot;amrabadh&quot; in Tarifit. Marabouts are known as &quot;sidi&quot; () in Maghrebi Arabic. Many cities in Morocco got their names from local marabouts, and the name of those cities usually begins with &quot;Sidi&quot; followed by the name of the local marabout. Modern Standard Arabic for &quot;saint&quot; is &quot;walī&quot; ().

A marabout may also refer to a tomb ( &quot;qubba&quot; &quot;dome&quot;) of a venerated saint, and such places have become holy centers and places of pious reflection.

===Some Zāwiyas linked with specific marabouts===
Note zāwiyas are not places of formal pilgrimage, which are limited in Islam to the Hajj and to Jerusalem, but are rather places of reflection and inspiration for the pious.

<text>The Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) is an encapsulation of the Internet Protocol designed to work over serial ports and router connections. It is documented in . On personal computers, SLIP has largely been replaced by the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which is better engineered, has more features, and does not require its IP address configuration to be set before it is established. On microcontrollers, however, SLIP is still the preferred way of encapsulating IP packets, due to its very small overhead.

Some people refer to the successful and widely used RFC 1055 Serial Line Internet Protocol as &quot;Rick Adams&#x27; SLIP&quot;, to avoid confusion with other proposed protocols named &quot;SLIP&quot;. Those other protocols include the much more complicated appendix D Serial Line Interface Protocol.

==Description==

SLIP modifies a standard TCP/IP datagram by:

* appending a special &quot;END&quot; byte to it, which distinguishes datagram boundaries in the byte stream,
* if the END byte occurs in the data to be sent, the two byte sequence ESC, ESC_END is sent instead,
* if the ESC byte occurs in the data, the two byte sequence ESC, ESC_ESC is sent.
* variants of the protocol may begin, as well as end, packets with END.

SLIP requires a serial port configuration of 8 data bits, no parity, and either EIA hardware flow control, or CLOCAL mode (3-wire null-modem) UART operation settings.

SLIP does not provide error detection, being reliant on upper layer protocols for this. Therefore, SLIP on its own is not satisfactory over a link which is error-prone, such as a poor quality dial-up connection.

SLIP escape characters were also required on some modem connections to escape Hayes command set, allowing therefore to pass binary data through those modems that would recognize some characters as commands.

==CSLIP==
A version of SLIP with header compression is called Compressed SLIP (CSLIP). The compression algorithm used in CSLIP is known as Van Jacobson TCP/IP Header Compression. CSLIP has no effect on the data payload of a packet and is independent of any compression by the serial line modem used for transmission. It reduces the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) header from twenty bytes to seven bytes. CSLIP has no effect on User Datagram Protocol (UDP) datagrams.

== History ==

RFC 1055, a &quot;non-standard&quot; for SLIP, traces its origins to the 3COM UNET TCP/IP implementation from the 1980s. Rick Adams added SLIP to the popular 4.2BSD in 1984 and it &quot;quickly caught on&quot;. By the time of the RFC (1988), it is described as &quot;commonly used on dedicated serial links and sometimes for dialup purposes&quot;.

The last version of FreeBSD to include &quot;slattach&quot; (a command for connecting to slip) in the manual database is FreeBSD 7.4, released 2011. The manual claims that auto-negotiation exists for CSLIP. The FreeBSD version is inherited from 4.3BSD.

Linux formerly used the same code base for SLIP and KISS (TNC). The split occurred before the start of kernel git history (Linux-2.6.12-rc2, 2005). The SLIP driver offers a special &quot;6-bit&quot; escaped mode to accommodate modems incapable of handling non-ASCII characters. The Linux slattach command (written independently) also has the ability to auto-detect CSLIP support.

<text>Cap-Vert, or the Cape Verde Peninsula, and Kap Weert or Bopp bu Nëtëx (in Wolof), is a peninsula in Senegal and the westernmost point of the continent of Africa and of the Afro-Eurasia mainland. Portuguese explorers called it Cabo Verde or &quot;Green Cape&quot;. The Cape Verde islands, further west, are named after the cape. Dakar, the capital of Senegal, occupies parts including its southern tip. The peninsula marks the border between Grande Côte to the north and Petite Côte to the south. It is delimited by two capes, Pointe des Almadies to the northwest and cap Manuel to the southeast.

The larger of the Deux Mamelles volcanic hills in Dakar is topped by Les Mamelles Lighthouse at its highest point.

== History ==
It is identified with the Hesperu Ceras (literally &quot;western horn&quot;) mentioned by Classical Graeco-Roman authors as the westernmost point of the African continent.

<text>Mars 4 (), also known as 3MS No.52S was a Soviet spacecraft intended to explore Mars. A 3MS spacecraft launched as part of the Mars programme, it was intended to enter orbit around Mars in 1974. However, computer problems prevented orbital insertion from occurring.

== Spacecraft ==
The Mars 4 spacecraft carried an array of instruments to study Mars. In addition to cameras, it was equipped with a radio telescope, an IR radiometer, multiple photometers, polarimeters, a magnetometer, plasma traps, an electrostatic analyzer, a gamma-ray spectrometer, and a radio probe.

Built by Lavochkin, Mars 4 was the first of two 3MS spacecraft launched to Mars in 1973, being followed by Mars 5. A 3MS was also launched during the 1971 launch window as Kosmos 419. However, due to a launch failure, it failed to depart Earth orbit. In addition to the orbiters, two 3MP lander missions, Mars 6 and Mars 7, were launched during the 1973 window.

== Launch ==
Mars 4 was launched by a Proton-K carrier rocket, a Blok D upper stage, flying from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81/23. The launch occurred at 19:30:59 UTC on 21 July 1973, with the first three stages placing the spacecraft and upper stage into a low Earth parking orbit before the Blok D fired to propel Mars 4 into heliocentric orbit bound for Mars.

Shortly after performing a course correction on 30 July 1973, two onboard computers failed, leaving Mars 4 unable to perform maneuvers. As a result of this, it was unable to enter orbit around Mars. Twelve photographs were taken on 10 February 1974 from 15:32 UTC to 15:38 UTC as the probe flew past Mars with a closest approach of at 15:34 UTC.

== Scientific Instruments ==
Mars 4 orbiter carried 15 scientific instruments on board to study Mars from orbital trajectory

<text>Mars 5 (), also known as 3MS No.53S was a Soviet spacecraft launched to explore Mars. A 3MS spacecraft launched as part of the Mars programme, it successfully entered orbit around Mars in 1974. However, it failed a few weeks later.

== Spacecraft ==
The Mars 5 spacecraft carried an array of instruments to study Mars. In addition to cameras, it was equipped with a radio telescope, an IR radiometer, multiple photometers, polarimeters, a magnetometer, plasma traps, an electrostatic analyser, a gamma-ray spectrometer, and a radio probe. The Three cameras were a 52mm Vega, a 350mm Zulfar and a panoramic camera.

Built by Lavochkin, Mars 5 was the second of two 3MS spacecraft launched to Mars in 1973, following Mars 4. A 3MS was also launched during the 1971 launch window as Kosmos 419. However, due to a launch failure, it failed to depart Earth orbit.
In addition to the orbiters, two 3MP lander missions, Mars 6 and Mars 7, were launched during the 1973 window.

== Launch ==
Mars 5 was launched by a Proton-K carrier rocket with a Blok D upper stage, flying from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81/24. The launch occurred at 18:55:48 UTC on 25 July 1973, with the first three stages placing the spacecraft and upper stage into a low Earth parking orbit before the Blok D fired to propel Mars 5 into heliocentric orbit bound for Mars.

The spacecraft performed course correction manoeuvres on 3 August 1973 and 2 February 1974.

==Mars orbit==

The probe reached Mars on 12 February 1974. At 14:44:25 the spacecraft&#x27;s engines ignited to begin its orbit insertion burn, which successfully placed it into an Areocentric orbit with a periapsis of , an apoapsis of , and 35.3 degrees inclination.

The spacecraft&#x27;s pressurised instrument compartment began to leak as soon as the spacecraft entered orbit around Mars, which controllers believed to be the result of a micrometeoroid impact during orbital insertion. It ceased operations on 28 February, having returned 180 photographic frames, 43 of which were of usable quality. The probe&#x27;s original planned lifetime in Mars orbit had been three months. The probe&#x27;s gamma ray spectrometer measured the uranium, thorium and potassium content of the surface the probe passed over and found they were similar to igneous rocks on Earth. The exact ratios of the elements varied with the age of the surface. Mars 5&#x27;s Infrared radiometer reported a daytime surface temperature of between . Night time temperatures were measured at . 

The probe also made a number of observations of Mars&#x27;s atmosphere. It found an ozone layer at an altitude of and observed clouds.

<text>Mars 6 (), also known as 3MP No.50P was a Soviet spacecraft launched to explore Mars. A 3MP bus spacecraft launched as part of the Mars program, it consisted of a lander, and a coast stage with instruments to study Mars as it flew past.

== Spacecraft ==
The Mars 6 spacecraft carried an array of instruments to study Mars. The lander was equipped with a thermometer and barometer to determine the surface conditions, an accelerometer and radio altimeter for descent, and instruments to analyse the surface material including a mass spectrometer. The coast stage, or bus, carried a magnetometer, plasma traps, cosmic ray and micrometeoroid detectors, and an instrument to study proton and electron fluxes from the Sun.

Built by Lavochkin, Mars 6 was the first of two 3MP spacecraft launched to Mars in 1973 and was followed by Mars 7. Two orbiters, Mars 4 and Mars 5, were launched earlier in the 1973 Mars launch window and were expected to relay data for the two landers. However, Mars 4 failed to enter orbit, and Mars 5 failed after a few days in orbit.

== Launch ==
Mars 6 was launched by a Proton-K carrier rocket with a Blok D upper stage, flying from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81/23. The launch occurred at 17:45:48 UTC on 5 August 1973, with the first three stages placing the spacecraft and upper stage into a low Earth parking orbit before the Blok D fired to propel Mars 6 into heliocentric orbit bound for Mars. The spacecraft performed a course correction on 13 August 1973.

Mars 6&#x27;s lander separated from the flyby bus on 12 March 1974 at an altitude of from the surface of Mars. The bus made a flyby with a closest approach of . The lander encountered the atmosphere of Mars at 09:05:53 UTC, slowing from as it passed through the upper atmosphere. A parachute was then deployed to further slow the probe&#x27;s descent, and retrorockets were intended to fire during the last seconds before the probe reached the ground.

The spacecraft returned data for 224 seconds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere. However, at 09:11:05 UTC, with the spacecraft about to fire its retrorockets in preparation for landing, all contact was lost. Due to a design flaw, a chip aboard the spacecraft had degraded during the mission, and a large amount of the data which had been returned was unusable.

<text>Mars 7 (), also known as 3MP No.51P was a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1973 to explore Mars. A 3MP bus spacecraft which comprised the final mission of the Mars programme, it consisted of a lander and a coast stage with instruments to study Mars as it flew past. Due to a malfunction, the lander failed to perform a maneuver necessary to enter the Martian atmosphere, missing the planet and remaining in heliocentric orbit along with the coast stage.

== Spacecraft ==
Mars 7 spacecraft carried an array of instruments to study Mars. The lander was equipped with a thermometer and barometer to determine the surface conditions, an accelerometer and radio altimeter for descent, and instruments to analyse the surface material including a mass spectrometer. The coast stage, or bus, carried a magnetometer, plasma traps, cosmic ray and micrometeoroid detectors, stereo antennae, and an instrument to study proton and electron fluxes from the Sun.

Built by Lavochkin, Mars 7 was the second of two 3MP spacecraft launched to Mars in 1973, having been preceded by Mars 6. Two orbiters, Mars 4 and Mars 5, were launched earlier in the 1973 Mars launch window and were expected to relay data for the two landers. However, Mars 4 failed to enter orbit, and Mars 5 failed after a few days in orbit.

== Launch ==
Mars 7 was launched by a Proton-K carrier rocket with a Blok D upper stage, flying from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81/24. The launch occurred at 17:00:17 UTC on 9 August 1973, with the first three stages placing the spacecraft and upper stage into a low Earth parking orbit before the Blok D fired to propel Mars 7 into heliocentric orbit bound for Mars. The spacecraft performed a course correction on 16 August 1973.

Mars 7&#x27;s lander separated from the flyby bus on 9 March 1974. Initially, it failed to separate. However, it was eventually released to begin its descent. Due to a retrorocket failure, the probe missed the atmosphere of Mars, and, instead of landing, flew past along with the coast stage, with a closest approach of . Known faults with the spacecraft&#x27;s transistors were blamed for the failure, along with that of Mars 4.

<text>The Mars 2 was an uncrewed space probe of the Mars program, a series of uncrewed Mars landers and orbiters launched by the Soviet Union beginning 19 May 1971.

The Mars 2 and Mars 3 missions consisted of identical spacecraft, each with an orbiter and an attached lander. The orbiter is identical to the Venera 9 bus. The type of bus/orbiter is the 4MV. They were launched by a Proton-K heavy launch vehicle with a Blok D upper stage. The lander of Mars 2 became the first human-made object to reach the surface of Mars, although the landing system failed and the lander was lost.

==Overview==
* Launch Date/Time:
** Mars 2: 19 May 1971 at 16:22:44 UTC
* Launch mass (including fuel):
** Combined: 
** Orbiter: 
** Lander: 
* On-orbit dry mass: 
* Dimensions: tall, across ( across with solar panels deployed)

==Launch==
On 19 May 1971, the Proton-K heavy launch vehicle launched the probe from Baikonur Cosmodrome. After the first stage separated the second stage was ignited. The third stage engine blasted Mars 2 into parking orbit, then the Blok D upper stage sent Mars 2 on the trans-Mars trajectory.

==Orbiter==
The Orbiter type was the 4MV, used also for Mars-3 and later Mars and Venera Probes. The orbiter engine performed a burn to put the spacecraft into a , 18-hour orbit about Mars with an inclination of 48.9 degrees. Scientific instruments were generally turned on for about 30 minutes near periapsis.

The orbiter&#x27;s primary scientific objectives were to image the Martian surface and clouds, determine the temperature on Mars, study the topography, composition and physical properties of the surface, measure properties of the atmosphere, monitor the solar wind and the interplanetary and Martian magnetic fields, and act as a communications relay to send signals from the landers to the Earth.

By coincidence, a particularly large dust storm on Mars adversely affected the mission. When Mariner 9 arrived and successfully orbited Mars on 14 November 1971, just two weeks prior to Mars 2 and Mars 3, planetary scientists were surprised to find the atmosphere was thick with &quot;a planet-wide robe of dust, the largest storm ever observed.&quot; The surface was totally obscured. Unable to reprogram the mission computers, both Mars 2 and Mars 3 dispatched their landers immediately, and the orbiters used up a significant portion of their available data resources in snapping images of the featureless dust clouds below, rather than the surface mapping intended.

The Mars 2 orbiter sent back data covering the period from December 1971 to March 1972, although transmissions continued through August. It was announced that Mars 2 and Mars 3 had completed their missions by 22 August 1972, after 362 orbits. The probe, combined with Mars 3, sent back a total of 60 pictures. The images and data revealed mountains as high as , atomic hydrogen and oxygen in the upper atmosphere, surface temperatures ranging from , surface pressures of 5.5 to 6 mbar (0.55 to 0.6 kPa), water vapor concentrations 5,000 times less than in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the base of the ionosphere starting at altitude, and grains from dust storms as high as in the atmosphere. The images and data enabled the creation of surface relief maps, and gave information on Martian gravity and magnetic fields. The orbiter remains in Martian orbit.

==Lander==
===Lander spacecraft system===

The Mars 2 descent module was mounted on the bus/orbiter opposite the propulsion system. It consisted of a spherical diameter landing capsule, a diameter conical aerodynamic braking shield, a parachute system and retro-rockets.

The entire descent module had a fueled mass of , the spherical landing capsule accounting for of this. An automatic control system consisting of gas micro-engines and pressurised nitrogen containers provided attitude control. Four &quot;gunpowder&quot; engines were mounted to the outer edge of the cone to control pitch and yaw.

The main and auxiliary parachutes, the engine to initiate the landing, and the radar altimeter were mounted on the top section of the lander. Foam was used to absorb shock within the descent module. The landing capsule had four triangular petals which would open after landing, righting the spacecraft and exposing the instrumentation.

The lander was equipped with two television cameras with a 360 degree view of the surface as well as a mass spectrometer to study atmospheric composition; temperature, pressure, and wind sensors; and devices to measure mechanical and chemical properties of the surface, including a mechanical scoop to search for organic materials and signs of life. It also contained a pennant with the State Emblem of the Soviet Union.

Four aerials protruded from the top of the sphere to provide communications with the orbiter via an onboard radio system. The equipment was powered by batteries which were charged by the orbiter prior to separation. Temperature control was maintained through thermal insulation and a system of radiators. The landing capsule was sterilised before launch to prevent contamination of the Martian environment.

====PrOP-M rover====
Mars 2 lander had a small Mars rover on board, which would move across the surface on skis while connected to the lander with a umbilical. Two small metal rods were used for autonomous obstacle avoidance, as radio signals from Earth would take too long to drive the rovers using remote control. The rover carried a dynamic penetrometer and a radiation densitometer.

The main PrOP-M frame was a square box with a small protrusion at the center. The frame was supported on two wide flat skis, one extending down from each side elevating the frame slightly above the surface.

The rover was planned to be placed on the surface after landing by a manipulator arm and to move in the field of view of the television cameras and stop to make measurements every . The traces of movement in the Martian soil would also be recorded to determine material properties.

Because of the demise of the lander, the rover was not deployed.

===Entry, descent, and crash landing===
The descent module separated from the orbiter on 27 November 1971 about 4.5 hours before reaching Mars. After entering the atmosphere at approximately 6 km/s, the descent system on the module malfunctioned, possibly because the angle of entry was too steep. The descent sequence did not operate as planned and the parachute did not deploy.
The descent module became the first man-made object to impact the surface of Mars. The exact crash site is unknown, but it is estimated to be at . Attempts to contact the probe after the crash were unsuccessful.

<text>Mars 3 was a robotic space probe of the Soviet Mars program, launched May 28, 1971, nine days after its twin spacecraft Mars 2. The probes were identical robotic spacecraft launched by Proton-K rockets with a Blok D upper stage, each consisting of an orbiter and an attached lander.

After the Mars 2 lander crashed on the Martian surface, the Mars 3 lander became the first spacecraft to attain a soft landing on Mars, on December 2, 1971. However, it failed 110 seconds after landing, having transmitted only a gray image with no details. The Mars 2 orbiter and Mars 3 orbiter continued to circle Mars and transmit images back to Earth for another eight months.

==Overview==
* Launch date and time:
** Mars 3: May 28, 1971 at 15:26:30 UTC
* Launch mass (including fuel):
** Combined: 
** Orbiter: 
** Lander: 
* On-orbit dry mass: 
* Dimensions: tall, across ( across with solar panels deployed)

==Orbiter==
The primary purpose of the 4M-V orbiter was to study the topography of the Martian surface; analyze its soil composition; measure various properties of the atmosphere; monitor &quot;solar radiation, the solar wind and the interplanetary and martian magnetic fields&quot;. In addition, it served as a &quot;communications relay to send signals from the lander to Earth&quot;.

The orbiter suffered from a partial loss of fuel and did not have enough to put itself into a planned 25-hour orbit. The engine instead performed a truncated burn to put the spacecraft into a highly-elliptical long-period (12 day, 19 hours) orbit about Mars.

By coincidence, a particularly large dust storm on Mars adversely affected the mission. When Mariner 9 arrived and successfully orbited Mars on November 14, 1971, just two weeks prior to Mars 2 and Mars 3, planetary scientists were surprised to find the atmosphere was thick with &quot;a planet-wide robe of dust, the largest storm ever observed&quot;. The surface was totally obscured. Unable to reprogram the mission computers, both Mars 2 and Mars 3 dispatched their landers immediately, and the orbiters used up a significant portion of their available data resources in snapping images of the featureless dust clouds. 

The Mars 3 orbiter sent back data covering the period from December 1971 to March 1972, although transmissions continued through August. It was announced that Mars 3 had completed their mission by August 22, 1972, after 20 orbits. The probe, combined with Mars 2, sent back a total of 60 pictures. The images and data revealed mountains as high as 22 km, atomic hydrogen and oxygen in the upper atmosphere, surface temperatures ranging from −110 °C to +13 °C, surface pressures of 5.5 to 6 mb, water vapor concentrations 5000 times less than in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the base of the ionosphere starting at 80 to 110 km altitude, and grains from dust storms as high as 7 km in the atmosphere. The images and data enabled creation of surface relief maps, and gave information on the Martian gravity and magnetic fields.

==Lander==
===Lander spacecraft system===
The Mars 3 descent module was mounted on the bus/orbiter opposite the propulsion system. It consisted of a spherical 1.2 m diameter landing capsule, a 2.9 m diameter conical aerodynamic braking shield, a parachute system and retro-rockets.

The entire descent module had a fueled mass of 1210 kg, the spherical landing capsule accounted for 358 kg of this. An automatic control system consisting of gas micro-engines and pressurized nitrogen containers provided attitude control. Four solid-fuel motors were mounted to the outer edge of the cone to control pitch and yaw.

The main and auxiliary parachutes, the engine to initiate the landing, and the radar altimeter were mounted on the top section of the lander. Foam was used to absorb shock within the descent module. The landing capsule had four triangular petals which would open after landing, righting the spacecraft and exposing the instrumentation.

The lander was equipped with two television cameras with a 360 degree view of the surface as well as a mass spectrometer to study atmospheric composition; temperature, pressure, and wind sensors; and devices to measure mechanical and chemical properties of the surface, including a mechanical scoop to search for organic materials and signs of life. It also contained a pennant with the Soviet coat of arms.

Four aerials protruded from the top of the sphere to provide communications with the orbiter via an onboard radio system. The equipment was powered by batteries which were charged by the orbiter prior to separation. Temperature control was maintained through thermal insulation and a system of radiators. The landing capsule was sterilized before launch to prevent contamination of the martian environment.

====PrOP-M rover====
Mars 3 lander had a small 4.5 kg Mars rover on board, which would move across the surface on skis while connected to the lander with a 15-meter umbilical. Two small metal rods were used for autonomous obstacle avoidance, as radio signals from Earth would take too long to drive the rovers using remote control. The rover carried a dynamic penetrometer and a radiation densitometer.

The main PrOP-M frame was a square box with a small protrusion at the center. The frame was supported on two wide flat skis, one extending down from each side elevating the frame slightly above the surface.

The rover was planned to be placed on the surface after landing by a manipulator arm and to move in the field of view of the television cameras and stop to make measurements every 1.5 metres. The traces of movement in the Martian soil would also be recorded to determine material properties.

Due to communication loss it is unknown whether the rover was deployed.

===Entry, descent, landing, transmission, and failure===

Mars 3&#x27;s descent module was released at 09:14 UT on December 2, 1971, 4 hours 35 minutes before reaching Mars. The descent module entered the Martian atmosphere at roughly 5.7 km/s. Through aerodynamic braking, parachutes, and retrorockets, the lander achieved a soft landing at and began operations.

The lander began transmitting to the Mars 3 orbiter 90 seconds after landing. After 20 seconds, transmission stopped for unknown reasons. It is not known whether the fault originated with the lander or the communications relay on the orbiter. The cause of the failure may have been related to the extremely powerful dust storm taking place at the time which may have induced a coronal discharge, damaging the communications system. The dust storm would also explain the poor image lighting.

A partial image (70 lines) was transmitted. According to V. G. Perminov, the lead designer for Mars and Venus spacecraft at the Lavochkin design bureau during the early days of Mars exploration, the image was &quot;a gray background with no details&quot;.

=== Possible images of lander on Mars ===
On April 11, 2013, NASA announced that the &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; (MRO) may have imaged the Mars 3 lander hardware on the surface of Mars. The HiRISE camera on the MRO took images of what may be the parachute, retrorockets, heat shield and lander. This discovery was made by amateur space enthusiasts looking through publicly available archived images.

<doc id="101453" wikidata="Q550402" url="?curid=101453" title="Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions">
<text>In number theory, Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem, also called the Dirichlet prime number theorem, states that for any two positive coprime integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, there are infinitely many primes of the form &quot;a&quot; + &quot;nd&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is also a positive integer. In other words, there are infinitely many primes that are congruent to &quot;a&quot; modulo &quot;d&quot;. The numbers of the form &quot;a&quot; + &quot;nd&quot; form an arithmetic progression

:formula_1

and Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem states that this sequence contains infinitely many prime numbers. The theorem extends Euclid&#x27;s theorem that there are infinitely many prime numbers (of the form 1 + 2n). Stronger forms of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem state that for any such arithmetic progression, the sum of the reciprocals of the prime numbers in the progression diverges and that different such arithmetic progressions with the same modulus have approximately the same proportions of primes. Equivalently, the primes are evenly distributed (asymptotically) among the congruence classes modulo &quot;d&quot; containing &quot;a&quot;&#x27;s coprime to &quot;d&quot;. 

The theorem is named after the German mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, who proved it in 1837.

==Examples==
The primes of the form 4&quot;n&quot; + 3 are 
: 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 31, 43, 47, 59, 67, 71, 79, 83, 103, 107, 127, 131, 139, 151, 163, 167, 179, 191, 199, 211, 223, 227, 239, 251, 263, 271, 283, ... 
They correspond to the following values of &quot;n&quot;: 
: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 25, 26, 31, 32, 34, 37, 40, 41, 44, 47, 49, 52, 55, 56, 59, 62, 65, 67, 70, 76, 77, 82, 86, 89, 91, 94, 95, ...
The strong form of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem implies that
:formula_2
is a divergent series.

Sequences &quot;dn&quot; + &quot;a&quot; with odd &quot;d&quot; are often ignored because half the numbers are even and the other half is the same numbers as a sequence with 2&quot;d&quot;, if we start with &quot;n&quot; = 0. For example, 6&quot;n&quot; + 1 produces the same primes as 3&quot;n&quot; + 1, while 6&quot;n&quot; + 5 produces the same as 3&quot;n&quot; + 2 except for the only even prime 2. The following table lists several arithmetic progressions with infinitely many primes and the first few ones in each of them.

We can generate some forms of primes by using an iterative method. For example, we can generate primes of the form formula_3 by using the following method:

Let formula_4. Then we let formula_5 which is prime. We continue by computing formula_6. Because formula_7 is of the form formula_3, either 13 or 67 is of the form formula_3. We have that formula_10 and is prime, so formula_11. We then continue this process to find successive primes of the form formula_3 (Silverman 2013). 

==Distribution==

Since the primes thin out, on average, in accordance with the prime number theorem, the same must be true for the primes in arithmetic progressions. It is natural to ask about the way the primes are shared between the various arithmetic progressions for a given value of &quot;d&quot; (there are &quot;d&quot; of those, essentially, if we do not distinguish two progressions sharing almost all their terms). The answer is given in this form: the number of feasible progressions &quot;modulo&quot; &quot;d&quot; — those where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot; do not have a common factor &gt; 1 — is given by Euler&#x27;s totient function

:formula_13

Further, the proportion of primes in each of those is

:formula_14

For example, if &quot;d&quot; is a prime number &quot;q&quot;, each of the &quot;q&quot; − 1 progressions

:formula_15
:formula_16
:formula_17
:formula_18

(all except formula_19)

contains a proportion 1/(&quot;q&quot; − 1) of the primes.

When compared to each other, progressions with a quadratic nonresidue remainder have typically slightly more elements than those with a quadratic residue remainder (Chebyshev&#x27;s bias).

==History==

In 1737, Euler related the study of prime numbers to what is known now as the Riemann zeta function: he showed that the value formula_20 reduces to a ratio of two infinite products, Π &quot;p&quot; / Π (&quot;p&quot;–1), for all primes &quot;p&quot;, and that the ratio is infinite. In 1775, Euler stated the theorem for the cases of a + nd, where a = 1. 
This special case of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem can be proven using cyclotomic polynomials.
The general form of the theorem was first conjectured by Legendre in his attempted unsuccessful proofs of quadratic reciprocity — as Gauss noted in his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; — but it was proved by with Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-series. The proof is modeled on Euler&#x27;s earlier work relating the Riemann zeta function to the distribution of primes. The theorem represents the beginning of rigorous analytic number theory.

 gave an elementary proof.

==Proof==
Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem is proved by showing that the value of the Dirichlet L-function (of a non-trivial character) at 1 is nonzero. The proof of this statement requires some calculus and analytic number theory . The particular case &quot;a&quot; = 1 (i.e., concerning the primes that are congruent to 1 modulo some &quot;n&quot;) can be proven by analyzing the splitting behavior of primes in cyclotomic extensions, without making use of calculus .

Although the proof of Dirichlet&#x27;s Theorem makes use of calculus and analytic number theory, some proofs of examples are much more straightforward. In particular, the proof of the example of infinitely many primes of the form formula_21 makes an argument similar to the one made in the proof of Euclid&#x27;s theorem (Silverman 2013). The proof is given below:

We want to prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form formula_21. Assume, for contradiction, that there are only finitely many primes of the form formula_21. We then compile a list of all such primes formula_24 where formula_25. Let formula_26. It is clear that none of the primes in the list formula_24 divide formula_28. Next, suppose that formula_28 is composite. Then formula_28 has unique prime factorization formula_31 where each formula_32 is prime. Because formula_33, formula_28 is odd and must be the product of only odd primes. Any odd prime formula_35 must be such that formula_36 or formula_37. It cannot be that formula_38 formula_39 because if this were the case, then formula_40. So there exists a prime formula_41 such that formula_42. However, none of the primes in the list formula_24 divide formula_28, a contradiction. Therefore formula_28 must be prime and formula_46. Hence, formula_47 is a prime of the form formula_21, but it isn&#x27;t included in the list formula_24. Thus, the list doesn&#x27;t contain all such primes and there must be infinitely many primes of the form formula_21 (Silverman 2013).

==Generalizations==

The Bunyakovsky conjecture generalizes Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem to higher-degree polynomials. Whether or not even simple quadratic polynomials such as (known from Landau&#x27;s fourth problem) attain infinitely many prime values is an important open problem.

Dickson&#x27;s conjecture generalizes Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem to more than one polynomial.

Schinzel&#x27;s hypothesis H generalizes these two conjectures, i.e. generalizes to more than one polynomial with degree larger than one.

In algebraic number theory, Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem generalizes to the Chebotarev&#x27;s density theorem.

Linnik&#x27;s theorem (1944) concerns the size of the smallest prime in a given arithmetic progression. Linnik proved that the progression &quot;a&quot; + &quot;nd&quot; (as &quot;n&quot; ranges through the positive integers) contains a prime of magnitude at most &quot;cdL&quot; for absolute constants &quot;c&quot; and &quot;L&quot;. Subsequent researchers have reduced &quot;L&quot; to 5.

An analogue of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem holds in the framework of dynamical systems (T. Sunada and A. Katsuda, 1990).

Shiu showed that any arithmetic progression satisfying the hypothesis of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem will in fact contain arbitrarily long runs of &quot;consecutive&quot; prime numbers.

<text>Egg decorating is the art or craft of decorating eggs. It has been a popular art form throughout history because of the attractive, smooth, oval shape of the egg, and the ancient associations with eggs as a religious and cultural symbol. Egg decorating has been associated with Easter in recent times, but was practiced independently by many ancient cultures.

== History ==
Eggs are an important symbol in folklore and mythology, often representing life and rebirth, healing and protection, and sometimes featuring in creation myths. This means that traditional egg decorating existed throughout the world.

=== Africa ===
The oldest eggshells, decorated with engraved hatched patterns, are dated for 60,000 years ago and were found at Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa.

In Egypt, it is a tradition to decorate boiled eggs during Sham el-Nessim, a spring-ushering national holiday celebrated by Egyptians regardless of religion, which falls every year on the Monday following the Eastern Christian Easter.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, emu eggs are carved and the art created by them is known as kalti paarti carving. The art (which dates to the nineteenth century) is practised by people of different cultures, but it is associated most strongly with Aboriginal art.

=== Eurasia ===

A Punic ostrich egg was found in Villaricos, Spain.

Orthodox Christians in Mesopotamia used red dyed eggs to symbolise the blood of Christ, which is a possible origin of the Easter egg. Red eggs feature in Greek Easter celebrations, where people play games which involve tapping the red eggs against each other.

Persian culture has a tradition of egg decorating, which takes place during the spring equinox. This time marks Nowruz, the Persian New Year. Family members decorate eggs together and place them in a bowl. It is said that it is from this cultural tradition that the Christian practice on Easter ultimately originates, having been transmitted via the Slavs. 

Long ago Slavic and Iranic peoples formed a close continuum sharing many traditions and innovations in religion and language and in the first millennium many formerly Iranic peoples would eventually become Turkic or Slavic in identity. The tradition of Nowruz, which has its roots in at least ancient Zoroastrian tradition, is practised by Persian and Turkic peoples of various faiths, albeit the tradition of egg decorating may be even older than the holiday as known modernly.

Eastern European and North Asian cultures, particularly Slavic ones, have a strong tradition of decorating eggs which date back at least to times when Slavic paganism was the predominant religion. Chicken, duck and goose eggs are decorated variously with batik dyeing, applique, scratch-work, wax encaustic and carving. Egg decorating is particularly popular in Ukraine, where as in many Slavic countries, the eggs are called Pysanky. 

The renowned Russian court artist and jeweller Peter Carl Fabergé made exquisitely decorated precious metal and gemstone eggs for the Romanovs. These Fabergé eggs resembled standard decorated eggs, but they were made from gold and precious stones. In addition to the Slavs, many Turkic peoples also maintain closely related traditions of egg dying, associated with the coming of Spring and the Persian New Year Nowruz.

In many parts of Europe, egg decorating took place before the widespread adoption of Christianity. It is unclear to what extent paganism and Christianity influenced the practice. The earliest example of egg decoration in Europe was a decorated egg found buried with a young girl in modern-day Worms, Germany, dating to the 5th century, when eggs were not yet associated with Easter.

In Northern England, the tradition of Pace Egging (derived from Latin &quot;pascha&quot; meaning &#x27;Easter&#x27;) involved boiling eggs in onion skins to dye their shells a golden colour, or alternatively covered in leaves or flowers inside an onion skin to leave a patterned imprint. The tradition is practiced on Easter but is thought to be pre-Christian in origin. Scandinavian traditions also involved boiling eggs with flowers inside onion skins to colour them.

Another type of egg decoration is the Hungarian practice of egg shoeing, which requires goose eggs and miniature horse-shoes, made of iron or lead. The current world record of egg shoeing is 1119 shoes on a single ostrich egg.

== Techniques and modern practices ==

Any bird egg can be facilitated in this process, but most often the larger and stronger the eggshell is, the more favoured it will be by decorators.

Goose, duck and hens&#x27; eggs are usually &quot;blown&quot; – a hole is made in each end and the contents are blown out. The egg is then either carved, dyed, painted, appliqued or otherwise decorated (using a number of different techniques). Egg decoration is particularly popular in Eastern European countries.

Some eggs, like emu or ostrich eggs, are so large and strong that the shells may be carved without breaking. Decorations on emu eggs take advantage of the contrast in colours between the dark green mottled outside of the shell and the shell-underlay. 

Many modern egg artists decorate their &quot;art eggs&quot; by etching or carving, while others paint or cover their eggs with different materials, from paper and fabric to polymer clay and are often painted in bright, spring colours. Using eggs as a canvas has become so popular that special terms have developed with the art form. Egg artists also have their own guild, the International Egg Art Guild, which promotes the craft of egg artistry.

In the United States there are shows in many states where artists show their eggs and vendors of &quot;egging&quot; supplies can be found. Each year, the White House chooses a decorated egg from each state to display at easter.

<text>The Lebu (Lebou, &quot;Lébou&quot;) are a subgroup of Wolof in Senegal, West Africa, living on the peninsula of Cap-Vert, site of Dakar. The Lebu are primarily a fishing community, but they have a substantial business in construction supplies and real estate. They speak Lebu Wolof, which is closely related to Wolof proper but is not intelligible with it.

==Culture==
The Lebu political and spiritual capital is at Layene, situated in the Yoff neighborhood of northern Dakar. The largely Lebu religious sect and theocracy, the Layene, are headquartered there. In addition to Yoff, other Lebu centres are nearby Ouakam, Cambérène and Ngor.

Lebu society emphasizes piety and respect for elders. Lebu families include not only living people but also associated ancestral spirits. The Lebu are noted for their public exorcism dances and rituals, often attended by tourists. Most Lebu are adherents of Islam. 

==History==
The Lebu identity, separate from neighboring Wolof and Serer communities, goes back at least as far as the early 15th century, before European explorers arrived in the area. The traditional date of the founding of Yoff is 1430.

Lebu traditions place their origins, like those of the Wolof and Serer, north of the Senegal river which is a frequent debate that sparks regarding the Lebu. There were Lebu at Lake Guiers by the 16th century, and by 1700 they had moved into the Cap Vert peninsula, expelling a few Mandinka tribes already there. At the time the area was ruled by the Damel of Cayor. 

In 1776 a marabout rebellion broke out in Cayor. When it was crushed, some of the defeated Muslims took refuge among the Lebou. In 1790, despite the fact that most Lebous remained animist, led these marabouts to declare independence. After 20 years of war, in 1812 Cayor finally recognized their independence and Diop was proclaimed &quot;serigne&quot; (spiritual leader) of the community. This &#x27;Lebou Theocratic Republic&#x27; retains special legal autonomy to the present day.

Within the &#x27;Lebou Republic&#x27;, authority is vested in two assemblies: &quot;Diambouri Ndakarou&quot; and &quot;Diambouri Pintch&quot;, the assembly of Dakar and of the neighborhoods respectively. The neighborhood chiefs select the &quot;serigne&quot; from one of the Lebou aristocratic families, and he serves as a court of last resort. They also choose the &quot;diaraf&quot;, whose duty is to settle land and inheritance disputes. The &quot;Ndeyedy Rew&quot; serves as a sort of minister of interior and foreign affairs. Historically, he has managed relations with the French and served as the spokesperson for the community.

<text>The Cannes Film Festival (; ), until 2003 called the International Film Festival (&quot;&quot;), is an annual film festival held in Cannes, France, which previews new films of all genres, including documentaries, from all around the world. Founded in 1946, the invitation-only festival is held annually (usually in May) at the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès. The festival was formally accredited by the FIAPF in 1951.

Cannes is one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; major European film festivals, alongside Venice and Berlin, as well as one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; major international film festivals, alongside Venice, Berlin, Toronto and Sundance.

==History==
===The early years===

The Cannes Film Festival has its origins in 1938 when Jean Zay, the French Minister of National Education, on the proposal of high-ranking official and historian Philippe Erlanger and film journalist Robert Favre Le Bret decided to set up an international cinematographic festival. They found the support of the Americans and the British.

Its creation can be largely attributed to the French desire to compete with the Venice Film Festival, which at the time was the only international film festival and had shown a lack of impartiality with its fascist bias during those years. The political interference seemed evident in the 1937 edition when Benito Mussolini meddled to ensure that French pacifist film &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; would not win.

The last straw was in the 1938 event when Mussolini and Adolf Hitler respectively overruled the jury&#x27;s decision in order to award the &quot;Coppa Mussolini&quot; (Mussolini Cup) for the Best Film to Italian war film &quot;Luciano Serra, Pilot&quot;, produced under the supervision of Mussolini&#x27;s son, and the &quot;Coppa Mussolini&quot; for the Best Foreign Film to &quot;Olympia&quot;, a German documentary film about the Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics produced in association with the Nazi Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda despite the fact that the regulations at that time prohibited awarding a documentary.

Outraged by the decision and as a measure of protest, the French, British, and American jury members decided to withdraw from the festival with the intention of not returning. This snub encouraged the French to found a free festival. Thus, on 31 May 1939, the city of Cannes was finally selected as the location for the festival over Biarritz and the town hall along with the French government signed the International Film Festival&#x27;s official birth certificate with the name of &quot;Le Festival International du Film&quot;.

The reason for deciding Cannes was because of its touristic appeal as a French Riviera resort town and also because the city hall offered to increase the municipality&#x27;s financial participation, including the commitment of building a dedicated venue for the event.

Hollywood stars of the moment like Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Tyrone Power, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Marlene Dietrich, Mae West, Norma Shearer, Paul Muni, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, and George Raft arrived thanks to an Ocean liner chartered by MGM (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer). On 31 August, the opening night gala took place with the private screening of the American film &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; starring Charles Laughton and Maureen O&#x27;Hara and directed by William Dieterle. The next day, on 1 September, German troops invaded Poland. As a result, the festival was postponed for 10 days and it would be resumed if the circumstances allowed it. However, the situation only worsened and on 3 September, France and the United Kingdom declared war against Germany, sparking the Second World War. The French government ordered a general mobilization and this prevented the festival from continuing so it was finally cancelled.

In 1946, the festival was relaunched and from 20 September to 5 October 1946, twenty-one countries presented their films at the First Cannes International Film Festival, which took place at the former Casino of Cannes. In 1947, amid serious problems of efficiency, the festival was held as the &quot;Festival du film de Cannes&quot;, where films from sixteen countries were presented. The festival was not held in 1948 and 1950 due to budgetary problems.

In 1949, the &quot;Palais des Festivals&quot; was expressly constructed for the occasion on the seafront promenade of La Croisette, although its inaugural roof, while still unfinished, blew off during a storm. In 1951, the festival was moved to spring to avoid direct competition with the Venice Festival which was held in autumn.

===1950s and 1960s===
During the early 1950s, the festival attracted much tourism and press attention, with showbiz scandals and high-profile personalities&#x27; love affairs. At the same time, the artistic aspect of the festival started developing. Because of controversies over the selection of films, the Critics&#x27; Prize was created for the recognition of original films and daring filmmakers. In 1954, the Special Jury Prize was awarded for the first time. In 1955, the was created, replacing the &quot;Grand Prix du Festival&quot; which had been given until that year. In 1957, Dolores del Río was the first female member of the jury for the official selection.

In 1959, the &quot;Marché du Film&quot; (Film Market) was founded, giving the festival a commercial character and facilitating exchanges between sellers and buyers in the film industry. Today it has become the first international platform for film commerce. Still, in the 1950s, some outstanding films, like &quot;Night and Fog&quot; in 1956 and &quot;Hiroshima, My Love&quot; in 1959 were excluded from the competition for diplomatic concerns. Jean Cocteau, three times president of the jury in those years, is quoted to have said: &quot;The Cannes Festival should be a no man&#x27;s land in which politics has no place. It should be a simple meeting between friends.&quot;

In 1962, the International Critics&#x27; Week was born, created by the French Union of Film Critics as the first parallel section of the Cannes Film Festival. Its goal was to showcase first and second works by directors from all over the world, not succumbing to commercial tendencies. In 1965 Olivia de Havilland was named the first female president of the jury, while the next year Sophia Loren became president.

The 1968 festival was halted on 19 May. Some directors, such as Carlos Saura and Miloš Forman, had withdrawn their films from the competition. On 18 May filmmaker Louis Malle along with a group of directors took over the large room of the &quot;Palais&quot; and interrupted the projections in solidarity with students and labour on strike throughout France, and in protest to the eviction of the then President of the . The filmmakers achieved the reinstatement of the President, and they founded the Film Directors&#x27; Society (SRF) that same year. In 1969 the SRF, led by Pierre-Henri Deleau created the Directors&#x27; Fortnight (&quot;Quinzaine des Réalisateurs&quot;), a new non-competitive section that programs a selection of films from around the world, distinguished by the independent judgment displayed in the choice of films.

===1970s and 1980s===
During the 1970s, important changes occurred in the Festival. In 1972, Robert Favre Le Bret was named the new president, and Maurice Bessy the General Delegate. He introduced important changes in the selection of the participating films, welcoming new techniques, and relieving the selection from diplomatic pressures, with films like &quot;MASH&quot;, and later &quot;Chronicle of the Years of Fire&quot; marking this turn. In some cases, these changes helped directors like Andrei Tarkovsky overcome problems of censorship in their own country. Also, until that time, the different countries chose the films that would represent them in the festival. Yet, in 1972, Bessy created a committee to select French films, and another for foreign films.

In 1978, Gilles Jacob assumed the position of General Delegate, introducing the Caméra d&#x27;Or award, for the best first film of any of the main events, and the Un Certain Regard section, for the non-competitive categories. Other changes were the decrease of length of the festival down to thirteen days, thus reducing the number of selected films; also, until that point the Jury was composed by Film Academics, and Jacob started to introduce celebrities and professionals from the film industry.

In 1983, a new, much bigger Palais des Festivals et des Congrès was built to host the festival, while the Directors&#x27; Fortnight remained in the old building. The new building was nicknamed &quot;The Bunker&quot;, provoking much criticism, especially since it was hardly finished at the event and several technical problems occurred. In 1984 Pierre Viot replaced Robert Favre Le Bret as President of the Festival. In his term, the Festival started including films from more countries, like Philippines, China, Cuba, Australia, India, New Zealand and Argentina. In 1987, for the first time of the Festival, a red carpet was placed at the entrance of the Palais. In 1989, during the first Cinéma &amp; liberté forum, hundred directors from many countries signed a declaration &quot;against all forms of censorship still existing in the world&quot;.

===1990s to present===
In 1998, Gilles Jacob created the last section of the Official Selection: la Cinéfondation, aiming to support the creation of works of cinema in the world and to contribute to the entry of the new scenario writers in the circle of the celebrities. The Cinéfondation was completed in 2000 with &quot;La Résidence&quot;, where young directors could refine their writing and screenplays, and in 2005, &quot;L&#x27;Atelier&quot;, which helps twenty directors per year with the funding of their films. Gilles Jacob was appointed Honorary President in 2000, and in 2002, the Festival officially adopted the name &quot;Festival de Cannes&quot;.

During the 2000s, the Festival started focusing more on the technological advances taking place in the film world, especially the digital techniques. In 2004, the restored historical films of the Festival were presented as &quot;Cannes Classics&quot;, which included documentaries. In 2007, Thierry Frémaux became General Delegate. In 2009, he extended the Festival in Buenos Aires, as &quot;La Semana de Cine del Festival de Cannes&quot;, and in 2010, he created the &quot;Cannes Court Métrage&quot; for the Short Film competition.

On 20 March 2020, organizers announced the postponement of the Cannes Film Festival 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the festival was later cancelled outright. Spike Lee, director of &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; and &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;, had been chosen to lead the jury panel. In 2019, the jury panel had been led by Alejandro González Iñárritu, director of &quot;Birdman&quot;. Lee was later invited to head the jury of the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, held in July of that year.

In 2022, the festival denied press accreditation to Russian journalists associated with outlets who are not opposed to the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. On the opening night of the festival, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a video appearance where he talked about the war and the role of cinema in it.

Iris Knobloch was elected the first woman president of the festival in the same year, succeeding the co-founder and former head of French pay-TV operator Canal+, Pierre Lescure, who had served since 2014.

==Controversies==
In recent years, a number of gender and sexual controversies have surrounded the Cannes Film Festival. These include &quot;Heelgate&quot; in which numerous female attendees of a red carpet premiere were stopped from entering in 2015 for wearing flat soled shoes instead of high heels. The incident caused numerous female celebrities to wear flat soled shoes or no shoes at all to other red carpet premieres in a show of solidarity and protest.

As a result of the past sexual controversies and the MeToo movement that arose out of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, in 2018, Cannes Film Festival officials announced the creation of a telephone hotline during the festival in which victims could report incidents of sexual harassment and other crimes. The hotline is in collaboration with the French government.

General Delegate Thierry Frémaux reportedly &quot;banned&quot; selfies on the red carpet of the festival in 2015.

In 2017, along with the 70th anniversary events of the Festival, the issue of changing the rules on theatrical screening caused controversy. In 2018, the enforcement of theatrical screening in France resulted in Netflix withdrawing their films from the festival.

==Festival team==

The president of the festival, who represents the festival in front of financial partners, the public authorities and the media, is elected by the board of directors of the festival, officially named the &quot;French Association of the Film Festival&quot;.

The board is composed of authorities of the world of cinema, as well as of public authorities which subsidize the event. The president has a renewable 3-year mandate and appoints the members of his team, including the general delegate, with the approval of the board of directors. Sometimes a president, after his last term, becomes the honorary president of the festival.

The general delegate is responsible for the coordination of the events. When Gilles Jacob passed from general delegate to the position of the president, in 2001, two new positions were created to take over his former post, the general director to oversee the smooth running of the event, and the artistic director, responsible for the selection of films. However, in 2007, the artistic director Thierry Frémaux, became again the general delegate of the Festival.

The general secretary is responsible for the reception of works and other practical matters.

==Impact==
The festival has become an important showcase for European films. Jill Forbes and Sarah Street argue in &quot;European Cinema: An Introduction&quot; (), that Cannes &quot;became...extremely important for critical and commercial interests and for European attempts to sell films on the basis of their artistic quality&quot; (page 20). Forbes and Street also point out that, along with other festivals such as the Venice Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival, Cannes offers an opportunity to determine a particular country&#x27;s image of its cinema and generally foster the notion that European cinema is &quot;art&quot; cinema.

Additionally, given massive media exposure, the non-public festival is attended by many stars and is a popular venue for film producers to launch their new films and to attempt to sell their works to the distributors who come from all over the globe.

=== Cannes Film Festival in fiction ===
Though most of the media attention the festival receives is journalistic in nature, the festival has been explored from the standpoint of fiction by novelists over the years.

Michael Grothaus&#x27; &quot;Epiphany Jones&quot; is a social satire about the festival and film industry and explores sex trafficking that occurs during the festival. The book was named one of the best Hollywood novels of all time by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Iain Johnstone&#x27;s &quot;Cannes: The Novel&quot; is a dystopian tale about terrorists holding the festival hostage.

Paulo Coelho&#x27;s &quot;The Winner Stands Alone &quot; is also set at the Cannes Film Festival.

The culture and history of the festival has been covered in a number of non-fiction books.

The festival has been used as the backdrop and setting of several films, including &quot;The Last Horror Film&quot; (1982), &quot;La cité de la peur&quot; (1994), &quot;Festival in Cannes&quot; (2001), &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; (2002) and &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (2007); some of these were shot on location at the festival.

<doc id="101483" wikidata="Q3284176" url="?curid=101483" title="Stream of consciousness">
<text>In literary criticism, stream of consciousness is a narrative mode or method that attempts &quot;to depict the multitudinous thoughts and feelings which pass through the mind&quot; of a narrator. It is usually in the form of an interior monologue which is disjointed or has irregular punctuation. The term was first used in 1855 and was first applied to a literary technique in 1918. While critics have pointed to various literary precursors, it was not until the 20th century that this technique was fully developed by modernist writers such as Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf.

Stream of consciousness narratives continue to be used in modern prose and the term has been adopted to describe similar techniques in other art forms such as poetry, songwriting and film.

== Origin of term ==
Alexander Bain used the term in 1855 in the first edition of &quot;The Senses and the Intellect&quot;, when he wrote, &quot;The concurrence of Sensations in one common stream of consciousness–on the same cerebral highway–enables those of different senses to be associated as readily as the sensations of the same sense&quot;. But the term is commonly credited to William James who used it in 1890 in his &quot;The Principles of Psychology:&quot; &quot;consciousness, then, does not appear to itself as chopped up in bits ... it is nothing joined; it flows. A &#x27;river&#x27; or a &#x27;stream&#x27; are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described. In talking of it hereafter, let&#x27;s call it the stream of thought, consciousness, or subjective life&quot;&quot;.&quot;

The term was first applied in a literary context in &quot;The Egoist&quot;, April 1918, by May Sinclair, in relation to the early volumes of Dorothy Richardson&#x27;s novel sequence &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;. Richardson, however, described the term as a &quot;lamentably ill-chosen metaphor&quot;.

==Definition==

Stream of consciousness is a literary method of representing the flow of a character&#x27;s thoughts and sense impressions &quot;usually in an unpunctuated or disjointed form of interior monologue.&quot; While many sources use the terms stream of consciousness and interior monologue as synonyms, the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms&quot; suggests that &quot;they can also be distinguished psychologically and literarily. In a psychological sense, stream of consciousness is the subject matter, while interior monologue is the technique for presenting it&quot;. And for literature, &quot;while an interior monologue always presents a character&#x27;s thoughts &#x27;directly&#x27;, without the apparent intervention of a summarizing and selecting narrator, it does not necessarily mingle them with impressions and perceptions, nor does it necessarily violate the norms of grammar, or logic – but the stream‐of‐consciousness technique also does one or both of these things.&quot;

Similarly, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Online&quot;, while agreeing that these terms are &quot;often used interchangeably&quot;, suggests that, &quot;while an interior monologue may mirror all the half-thoughts, impressions, and associations that impinge upon the character&#x27;s consciousness, it may also be restricted to an organized presentation of that character&#x27;s rational thoughts&quot;.

In the following example of stream of consciousness from James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Molly seeks sleep:

a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so that I can get up early 
==Development==
===Beginnings to 1900===
While the use of the narrative technique of stream of consciousness is usually associated with modernist novelists in the first part of the twentieth century, several precursors have been suggested, including Laurence Sterne&#x27;s psychological novel &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; (1757). John Neal in his novel &quot;Seventy-Six&quot; (1823) also used an early form of this writing style, characterized by long sentences with multiple qualifiers and expressions of anxiety from the narrator. Prior to the 19th century, associationist philosophers, like Thomas Hobbes and Bishop Berkeley, discussed the concept of the &quot;train of thought&quot;. 

It has also been suggested that Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; (1843) foreshadows this literary technique in the nineteenth century. Poe&#x27;s story is a first person narrative, told by an unnamed narrator who endeavours to convince the reader of his sanity while describing a murder he committed, and it is often read as a dramatic monologue. George R. Clay notes that Leo Tolstoy, &quot;when the occasion requires it ... applies Modernist stream of consciousness technique&quot; in both &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1869) and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1878).

The short story, &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot; (1890), by another American author, Ambrose Bierce, also abandons strict linear time to record the internal consciousness of the protagonist. Because of his renunciation of chronology in favor of free association, Édouard Dujardin&#x27;s &quot;Les Lauriers sont coupés&quot; (1887) is also an important precursor. Indeed, James Joyce &quot;picked up a copy of Dujardin&#x27;s novel ... in Paris in 1903&quot; and &quot;acknowledged a certain borrowing from it&quot;.

Some point to Anton Chekhov&#x27;s short stories and plays (1881–1904) and Knut Hamsun&#x27;s &quot;Hunger&quot; (1890), and &quot;Mysteries&quot; (1892) as offering glimpses of the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative technique at the end of the nineteenth century. While &quot;Hunger&quot; is widely seen as a classic of world literature and a groundbreaking modernist novel, &quot;Mysteries&quot; is also considered a pioneer work. It has been claimed that Hamsun was way ahead of his time with the use of stream of consciousness in two chapters in particular of this novel. British author Robert Ferguson said: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of dreamlike aspects of &quot;Mysteries&quot;. In that book ... it is ... two chapters, where he invents stream of consciousness writing, in the early 1890s. This was long before Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce&quot;. Henry James has also been suggested as a significant precursor, in a work as early as &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1881). It has been suggested that he influenced later stream-of-consciousness writers, including Virginia Woolf, who not only read some of his novels but also wrote essays about them.

However, it has also been argued that Arthur Schnitzler (1862–1931), in his short story &#x27;&quot;Leutnant Gustl&quot; (&quot;None but the Brave&quot;, 1900), was the first to make full use of the stream of consciousness technique.

===Early twentieth century===
It was not until the twentieth century that this technique was fully developed by modernists. Marcel Proust is often presented as an early example of a writer using the stream of consciousness technique in his novel sequence &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; (1913–1927) (&quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;), but Robert Humphrey comments that Proust &quot;is concerned only with the reminiscent aspect of consciousness&quot; and that he &quot;was deliberately recapturing the past to communicate; hence he did not write a stream-of-consciousness novel&quot;. Novelist John Cowper Powys also argues that Proust did not use stream of consciousness: &quot;while we are told what the hero thinks or what Swann thinks we are told this rather by the author than either by the &#x27;I&#x27; of the story or by Charles Swann.&quot;
&quot;Pointed Roofs&quot; (1915), the first work in Richardson&#x27;s series of 13 semi-autobiographical novels titled &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;, is the first complete stream-of-consciousness novel published in English. However, in 1934, Richardson commented that &quot;Proust, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and D.R. ... were all using &#x27;the new method&#x27;, though very differently, simultaneously&quot;. 

James Joyce was another pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness. Some hints of this technique are already present in &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; (1916), along with interior monologue, and references to a character&#x27;s psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings. Joyce began writing &quot;A Portrait&quot; in 1907 and it was first serialised in the English literary magazine &quot;The Egoist&quot; in 1914 and 1915. Earlier in 1906, Joyce, when working on &quot;Dubliners&quot;, considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called Leopold Bloom under the title &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Serial publication of &quot;Ulysses&quot; in the magazine &quot;The Little Review&quot; began in March 1918. &quot;Ulysses&quot; was finally published in 1922. While &quot;Ulysses&quot; represents a major example of the use of stream of consciousness, Joyce also uses &quot;authorial description&quot; and Free Indirect Style to register Bloom&#x27;s inner thoughts. Furthermore, the novel does not focus solely on interior experiences: &quot;Bloom is constantly shown &quot;from&quot; all round; from inside as well as out; from a variety of points of view which range from the objective to the subjective&quot;. In his final work &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939), Joyce&#x27;s method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit, abandoning all conventions of plot and character construction, and the book is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns.

Another early example is the use of interior monologue by T. S. Eliot in his poem &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; (1915), &quot;a dramatic monologue of an urban man, stricken with feelings of isolation and an incapability for decisive action,&quot; a work probably influenced by the narrative poetry of Robert Browning, including &quot;Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister&quot;.

===1923 to 2000===

Prominent uses in the years that followed the publication of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; include Italo Svevo, &quot;La coscienza di Zeno&quot; (1923), Virginia Woolf in &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; (1925) and &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; (1927), and William Faulkner in &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; (1929). However, Randell Stevenson suggests that &quot;interior monologue, rather than stream of consciousness, is the appropriate term for the style in which [subjective experience] is recorded, both in &quot;The Waves&quot; and in Woolf&#x27;s writing generally.&quot; Throughout &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;, Woolf blurs the distinction between direct and indirect speech, freely alternating her mode of narration between omniscient description, indirect interior monologue, and soliloquy. Malcolm Lowry&#x27;s novel &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; (1947) resembles &quot;Ulysses&quot;, &quot;both in its concentration almost entirely within a single day of [its protagonist] Firmin&#x27;s life ... and in the range of interior monologues and stream of consciousness employed to represent the minds of [the] characters&quot;. 

Samuel Beckett, a friend of James Joyce, uses interior monologue in novels like &quot;Molloy&quot; (1951), &quot;Malone meurt&quot; (1951; &quot;Malone Dies&quot;) and &quot;L&#x27;innommable&quot; (1953: &quot;The Unnamable&quot;). and the short story &quot;From an Abandoned Work&quot; (1957). French writer Jean-Paul Sartre employed the technique in his Roads to Freedom trilogy of novels, most prominently in the second book &quot;The Reprieve&quot; (1945). 

The technique continued to be used into the 1970s in a novel such as Robert Anton Wilson/Robert Shea collaborative &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; (1975), concerning which &quot;The Fortean Times&quot; warns readers to &quot;[b]e prepared for streams of consciousness in which not only identity but time and space no longer confine the narrative&quot;.

Although loosely structured as a sketch show, Monty Python produced an innovative stream-of-consciousness for their TV show &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, with the BBC stating, &quot;[Terry] Gilliam&#x27;s unique animation style became crucial, segueing seamlessly between any two completely unrelated ideas and making the stream-of-consciousness work&quot;.

Scottish writer James Kelman&#x27;s novels are known for mixing stream of consciousness narrative with Glaswegian vernacular. Examples include &quot;The Busconductor Hines&quot; (1984), &quot;A Disaffection&quot; (1989), &quot;How Late It Was, How Late&quot; (1994) and many of his short stories. With regard to Salman Rushdie, one critic comments that &quot;[a]ll Rushdie&#x27;s novels follow an Indian/Islamic storytelling style, a stream-of-consciousness narrative told by a loquacious young Indian man&quot;. Other writers who use this narrative device include Sylvia Plath in &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; (1963), the Soviet underground writer Pavel Ulitin in &quot;Immortality in the pocket&quot;, and Irvine Welsh in &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (1993).

Stream of consciousness continues to appear in contemporary literature. Dave Eggers, author of &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot; (2000), according to one reviewer, &quot;talks much as he writes – a forceful stream of consciousness, thoughts sprouting in all directions&quot;. Novelist John Banville describes Roberto Bolaño&#x27;s novel &quot;Amulet&quot; (1999), as written in &quot;a fevered stream of consciousness&quot;.

===Twenty-first century=== 
The twenty-first century brought further exploration, including Jonathan Safran Foer&#x27;s &quot;Everything is Illuminated&quot; (2002) and many of the short stories of American author Brendan Connell.

== Song lyrics ==
Stream of consciousness technique is also used in song lyrics. Songwriters such as Sun Kil Moon and Courtney Barnett use it in their songs. An early example is Outkast&#x27;s song &quot;A Life in the Day of Benjamin André (Incomplete)&quot; off their 2003 album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.

== Dialogue in films ==
Some filmmakers use the narrative technique. For example, the documentary &quot;Anonymous Club&quot; about songwriter Courtney Barnett is narrated using stream-of-consciousness. Terrence Malick&#x27;s films use it as well. 2022 film &quot;You Won&#x27;t Be Alone&quot; also uses it.

<doc id="101490" wikidata="Q2399132" url="?curid=101490" title="Seattle International Film Festival">
<text>The Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF) is a film festival held annually in Seattle, Washington, United States, since 1976. It usually takes place in late May and/or early June. It is one of the largest festivals in the world, and features a diverse assortment of predominantly independent and foreign films, and a strong contingent of documentaries.

SIFF 2006 included more than 300 films and 160,000 attendees; also it was the first SIFF to include a venue in neighboring Bellevue, Washington, after an ill-fated early attempt. However, in 2008, the festival was back to being entirely in Seattle, and had a slight decrease in the number of feature films. The 2010 festival featured over 400 films, shown primarily in downtown Seattle and its nearby neighborhoods, and in Renton, Kirkland, and Juanita Beach Park.

==History==

The festival began in 1976 at a then-independent cinema, the Moore Egyptian Theater, under the direction of managers Jim Duncan, Dan Ireland, and Darryl Macdonald. The first SIFF featured &quot;Hedda,&quot; with Glenda Jackson, Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;Black Moon,&quot; Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;Phantom of Liberty.&quot; The Rocky Horror Picture Show was the unnamed secret &quot;sneak preview.&quot; The Third Festival in 1978 was the first under the direction of Rajeeve Gupta. It doubled the number of films and increased the audience by 50% over the Second festival. The first five festivals were held at The Moore Egyptian. Currently, the Moore Theatre is back under its earlier name and functioning as a concert venue. When founders Dan Ireland and Darryl Macdonald of the Moore Egyptian lost their lease, they founded the Egyptian theater in a former Masonic Temple on Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill. The Egyptian theater remains a prime festival venue to this day, although the festival now typically uses about half a dozen cinemas (including, since 2007, its own SIFF Cinema at Seattle Center), with the exact roster varying from year to year.

During the 1980s, SIFF audiences developed a reputation for appreciating films that did not fit standard industry niches, such as Richard Rush&#x27;s multi-layered &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; (1980). SIFF was instrumental in the entry of Dutch films into the United States market, including the first major American debut for director Paul Verhoeven.

==The nature of the festival==

The festival includes a four-film &quot;Secret Festival&quot;. Those who attend the Secret Festival do not know in advance what they will see, and they must sign an oath that they will not reveal afterward what they have seen.

In general, SIFF has a reputation as an &quot;audience festival&quot; rather than an &quot;industry festival&quot;. The festival often partially overlaps the Cannes Film Festival, which can reduce attendance by industry bigwigs; in 2007 there were two days of overlap, May 24 and 25.

The SIFF group also curates the Global Lens film series, the Screenwriters Salon, and Futurewave (K-12 programming and youth outreach), coordinates SIFF-A-Go-Go travel programs (organized tours to other film festivals) and co-curates the 1 Reel Film Festival at Bumbershoot and the Sci-Fi Shorts Film Festival at the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame.

In 2006, Longhouse Media launched the SuperFly Filmmaking Experience, in partnership with the Seattle International Film Festival, which brings youth together from diverse backgrounds to work collaboratively on film projects that promote awareness of indigenous issues and mutual understanding of each other&#x27;s cultures. Fifty youth from across the United States arrive in Seattle to then travel to a local Pacific Northwest reservation to create 4 films in 36 hours.

==SIFF Cinema==
November 28, 2006, SIFF and Seattle mayor Greg Nickels announced that SIFF would soon have a home and a year-round screening facility in what has been the Nesholm Family Lecture Hall of McCaw Hall, the same building at Seattle Center that houses the Seattle Opera. The city contributed $150,000 to the $350,000 project. This auditorium was a &quot;flagship venue&quot; for SIFF festivals and the site of most press screenings.

Shortly after the 2011 festival, SIFF moved its operations to the SIFF Film Center on the Seattle Center campus. The Film Center includes a 90-seat multi-use theater, multi-media classroom, exhibition spaces, archives, and offices for SIFF and the Film School. In October 2011, SIFF Cinema moved from McCaw Hall to its current location in the Uptown Theater. SIFF utilizes all three of the Uptown&#x27;s three screens for year-round programming. SIFF currently has year-round programming for four screens in Seattle.

In May 2014 it was announced that SIFF had purchased the Uptown Theater, and would be leasing and renovating the Egyptian Theater (abandoned roughly a year earlier by Landmark Theatres) from Seattle Central College. In May 2023, SIFF announced it had acquired the Seattle Cinerama theater.

== Awards ==

Since 1985, the Seattle International Film Festival has awarded the Golden Space Needle award each year to the festival&#x27;s most popular movie. Ballots are cast by audience members at the end of each movie. Previous winners of the Golden Space Needle include &quot;Whale Rider&quot; for 2003, &quot;Trainspotting&quot; for 1996, &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; for 1985 and &quot;Boyhood&quot; for 2015, the latter two being the only films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and win the Golden Space Needle.

<doc id="101521" wikidata="Q131719" url="?curid=101521" title="The Prince">
<text>The Prince ( ; ) is a 16th-century political treatise written by the Italian diplomat, philosopher, and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli in the form of a realistic instruction guide for new princes. The Prince shocked many readers by assuming that immoral acts are justifiable if they achieve political glory.

From Machiavelli&#x27;s correspondence, a version was apparently being written in 1513, using a Latin title, &quot;De Principatibus&quot; (&quot;Of Principalities&quot;). However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli&#x27;s death. This was carried out with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but &quot;long before then, in fact since the first appearance of &quot;The Prince&quot; in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings&quot;.

Although &quot;The Prince&quot; was written as if it were a traditional work in the &quot;mirrors for princes&quot; style, it was generally agreed as being especially innovative. This is partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice that had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; and other works of Renaissance literature. Machiavelli illustrates his reasoning using remarkable comparisons of classical, biblical, and medieval events, including many seemingly positive references to the murderous career of Cesare Borgia, which occurred during Machiavelli&#x27;s own diplomatic career.

&quot;The Prince&quot; is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of modern philosophy, especially modern political philosophy, in which practical effect is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. Its world view came in direct conflict with the dominant Catholic and scholastic doctrines of the time, particularly those on politics and ethics.

This short treatise is the most remembered of Machiavelli&#x27;s works, and the most responsible for the later pejorative use of the word &quot;&quot;. It even contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words &quot; and &quot; in Western countries. In subject matter, it overlaps with the much longer &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot;, which was written a few years later. In its use of near-contemporary Italians as examples of people who perpetrated criminal deeds for political ends, another lesser-known work by Machiavelli to which &quot;The Prince&quot; has been compared is the &quot;Life of Castruccio Castracani&quot;.

== Summary ==
Each part of &quot;The Prince&quot; has attracted extensive commentary over centuries. Machiavelli&#x27;s writings continue to provoke examination of leadership and government, posing age-old issues regarding the nature of power and the decisions that rulers must make to preserve it.

===Letter to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Urbino===
Machiavelli prefaces his work with an introductory letter to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Urbino, the recipient of his work.

===The subject matter: New Princedoms (Chapters 1 and 2)===
&quot;The Prince&quot; starts by describing its subject. In the first sentence, Machiavelli uses the word &quot;state&quot; (Italian &quot;stato&quot;, which could also mean &quot;&quot;) to cover, in neutral terms, &quot;all forms of organization of supreme political power, whether republican or princely&quot;. How the word &quot;state&quot; acquired its modern meaning during the Renaissance has been the subject of much academic debate, with this sentence and similar ones in the works of Machiavelli being considered particularly important.

Machiavelli explained here that &quot;The Prince&quot; is about princedoms, indicating that he has written about republics elsewhere, which is a reference to the &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot;. Commentators note that in fact he mixes discussion of republics into this work in many places, effectively treating republics as a type of princedom with many strengths. More importantly, and less traditionally, he distinguishes new princedoms from established hereditary princedoms. He deals with hereditary princedoms quickly in Chapter 2, saying that they are much easier to rule. For such a prince, &quot;unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him&quot;. , comparing this claim to traditional presentations of advice for princes, wrote that the novelty in chapters 1 and 2 is the &quot;deliberate purpose of dealing with a new ruler who will need to establish himself in defiance of custom&quot;. Normally, these types of works were addressed only to hereditary princes. He thinks Machiavelli may have been influenced by Tacitus as well as his own experience.

This categorization of regime types is also &quot;un-Aristotelian&quot; and apparently simpler than the traditional one found for example in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot;, which divides regimes into those ruled by a single monarch, an oligarchy, or by the people, in a democracy. Machiavelli also ignores the classical distinctions between the good and corrupt forms, for example between monarchy and tyranny.

===&quot;Mixed&quot; princedoms (Chapters 3–5)===
New princedoms are either totally new or they are &quot;mixed&quot;, meaning that they are new parts of an older state, already belonging to that prince.

====New conquests added to older states (Chapter 3)====
Machiavelli generalizes that there were several virtuous Roman ways to hold a newly acquired province, using a republic as an example of how new princes can act:
* to install one&#x27;s princedom in the new acquisition, or to install colonies of one&#x27;s people there, which is better.
* to indulge the lesser powers of the area without increasing their power.
* to put down the powerful people.
* not to allow a foreign power to gain reputation.

More generally, Machiavelli emphasizes that one should have regard not only for present problems but also for the future ones. One should not &quot;enjoy the benefit of time&quot;, but rather the benefit of one&#x27;s virtue and prudence, because time can bring evil, as well as good.

Machiavelli notes in this chapter on the &quot;natural and ordinary desire to acquire&quot; and as such, those who act on this desire can be &quot;praised or blamed&quot; depending on the success of their acquisitions. He then goes into detail about how the King of France failed in his conquest of Italy, even saying how he could have succeeded. Machiavelli views doing harm to enemies as a necessity, stating, &quot;if an injury is to be done to a man, it should be so severe that the prince is not in fear of revenge&quot;.

====Conquered kingdoms (Chapter 4)====

In some cases, the old king of the conquered kingdom depended on his lords; 16th-century France, or in other words France as it was at the time of writing of &quot;The Prince&quot;, is given by Machiavelli as an example of such a kingdom. These are easy to enter, but difficult to hold.

When the kingdom revolves around the king, with everyone else his servant, then it is difficult to enter, but easy to hold. The solution is to eliminate the old bloodline of the prince. Machiavelli used the Persian empire of Darius III, conquered by Alexander the Great, to illustrate this point, and then noted that if one considers it, they will find this historical example similar to the &quot;kingdom of the Turk&quot; (Ottoman Empire) in their time – making this a potentially easier conquest to hold than France would be.

====Conquered free states, with their own laws and orders (Chapter 5)====
 notes that this chapter is quite atypical of any previous books for princes. Gilbert supposed the need to discuss conquering free republics is linked to Machiavelli&#x27;s project to unite Italy, which contained some free republics. As he also notes, the chapter in any case makes it clear that holding such a state is highly difficult for a prince. Machiavelli gives three options:
* Ruin them, as Rome destroyed Carthage, and also as Machiavelli says the Romans eventually had to do in Greece.
* Go to live there and rule it personally.
* Keep the state intact, but install an oligarchy.

Machiavelli advises the ruler to go the first route, stating that if a prince does not destroy a city, he can expect &quot;to be destroyed by it&quot;.

===Totally new states (Chapters 6–9)===
====Conquests by virtue (Chapter 6)====

Princes who rise to power through their own skill and resources (their &quot;virtue&quot;) rather than luck tend to have a hard time rising to the top, but once they reach the top they are very secure in their position. This is because they effectively crush their opponents and earn great respect from everyone else. Because they are strong and more self-sufficient, they have to make fewer compromises with their allies.

Machiavelli writes that reforming an existing order is one of the most dangerous and difficult things a prince can do. Part of the reason is that people are naturally resistant to change and reform. Those who benefited from the old order will resist change very fiercely, and those who may stand to benefit from the new order will be less enthusiastic in their support, because the new order is unfamiliar and they are not certain it will live up to its promises. Moreover, it is impossible for the prince to satisfy everybody&#x27;s expectations. Inevitably, he will disappoint some of his followers. Therefore, a prince must have the means to force his supporters to keep supporting him even when they start having second thoughts, otherwise he will lose his power. Only armed prophets, like Moses, succeed in bringing lasting change. Machiavelli claims that Moses killed uncountable numbers of his own people in order to enforce his will.

Machiavelli was not the first thinker to notice this pattern. Allan Gilbert wrote: &quot;In wishing new laws and yet seeing danger in them Machiavelli was not himself an innovator,&quot; because this idea was traditional and could be found in Aristotle&#x27;s writings. But Machiavelli went much further than any other author in his emphasis on this aim, and Gilbert associates Machiavelli&#x27;s emphasis upon such drastic aims with the level of corruption to be found in Italy.

====Conquest by fortune, meaning by someone else&#x27;s virtue (Chapter 7)====
According to Machiavelli, when a prince comes to power through luck or the blessings of powerful figures within the regime, he typically has an easy time gaining power but a hard time keeping it thereafter, because his power is dependent on his benefactors&#x27; goodwill. He does not command the loyalty of the armies and officials that maintain his authority, and these can be withdrawn from him at a whim. Having risen the easy way, it is not even certain such a prince has the skill and strength to stand on his own feet.

This is not necessarily true in every case. Machiavelli cites Cesare Borgia as an example of a lucky prince who escaped this pattern. Through cunning political maneuvers, he managed to secure his power base. Cesare was made commander of the papal armies by his father, Pope Alexander VI, but was also heavily dependent on mercenary armies loyal to the Orsini brothers and the support of the French king. Borgia won over the allegiance of the Orsini brothers&#x27; followers with better pay and prestigious government posts. To pacify the Romagna, he sent in his henchman, Remirro de Orco, to commit acts of violence. When Remirro started to become hated for his actions, Borgia responded by ordering him to be &quot;cut in two&quot; to show the people that the cruelty was not from him, although it was. When some of his mercenary captains started to plot against him, he had them captured and executed. When it looked as though the king of France would abandon him, Borgia sought new alliances.

Finally, Machiavelli makes a point that bringing new benefits to a conquered people will not be enough to cancel the memory of old injuries, an idea Allan Gilbert said can be found in Tacitus and Seneca the Younger.

====Of Those Who Have Obtained a Principality Through Crimes (Chapter 8)====
Conquests by &quot;criminal virtue&quot; are ones in which the new prince secures his power through cruel, immoral deeds, such as the elimination of political rivals.

Machiavelli offers two rulers to imitate, Agathocles of Syracuse and Oliverotto Euffreducci. After Agathocles became Praetor of Syracuse, he called a meeting of the city&#x27;s elite. At his signal, his soldiers killed all the senators and the wealthiest citizens, completely destroying the old oligarchy. He declared himself ruler with no opposition. So secure was his power that he could afford to absent himself to go off on military campaigns in Africa.

Machiavelli then states that the behavior of Agathocles is not simply virtue, as he says, &quot;Yet one cannot call it virtue to kill one&#x27;s citizens, betray one&#x27;s friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; these modes can enable one to acquire empire, but not glory. [...] Nonetheless, his savage cruelty and inhumanity, together with his infinite crimes, do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men. Thus, one cannot attribute to fortune or virtue what he achieved without either.&quot;

Machiavelli then goes to his next example, Oliverotto de Fermo, an Italian &quot;condottiero&quot; who recently came to power by killing all his enemies, including his uncle Giovanni Fogliani, at a banquet. After he laid siege to the governing council and terrified the citizenry, he had then set up a government with himself as absolute ruler. However, in an ironic twist, Oliverotto was killed the same way his opponents were, as Cesare Borgia had him strangled after he invited Oliverotto and Vitellozzo Vitelli to a friendly setting.

Machiavelli advises that a prince should carefully calculate all the wicked deeds he needs to do to secure his power, and then execute them all in one stroke. In this way, his subjects will slowly forget his cruel deeds and the prince can better align himself with his subjects. Princes who fail to do this, who hesitate in their ruthlessness, will have to &quot;keep a knife by his side&quot; and protect himself at all costs, as he can never trust himself amongst his subjects.

 remarks that this chapter is even less traditional than those it follows, not only in its treatment of criminal behavior, but also in the advice to take power from people at a stroke, noting that precisely the opposite had been advised by Aristotle in his &quot;Politics&quot; (5.11.1315a13). On the other hand, Gilbert shows that another piece of advice in this chapter, to give benefits when it will not appear forced, was traditional.

====Becoming a prince by the selection of one&#x27;s fellow citizens (Chapter 9)====
A &quot;civil principality&quot; is one in which a citizen comes to power &quot;not through crime or other intolerable violence&quot;, but by the support of his fellow citizens. This, he says, does not require extreme virtue or fortune, only &quot;fortunate astuteness&quot;. For this is one of the four means of coming about a principality (the other three being by virtue, fortune, and criminality).

Machiavelli makes an important distinction between two groups that are present in every city, and have very different appetites driving them: the &quot;great&quot; and the &quot;people&quot;. The &quot;great&quot; wish to oppress and rule the &quot;people&quot;, while the &quot;people&quot; wish &quot;not&quot; to be ruled or oppressed. A principality is not the only outcome possible from these appetites, because it can also lead to either &quot;liberty&quot; or &quot;license&quot;.

A principality is put into place either by the &quot;great&quot; or the &quot;people&quot; when they have the opportunity to take power, but find resistance from the other side. They assign a leader who can be popular to the people while the great benefit, or a strong authority defending the people against the great.

Machiavelli goes on to say that a prince who obtains power through the support of the nobles has a harder time staying in power than someone who is chosen by the common people; since the former finds himself surrounded by people who consider themselves his equals. He has to resort to malevolent measures to satisfy the nobles. One cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others, satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress, while the former only desire not to be oppressed.Also a prince cannot afford to keep the common people hostile as they are larger in number while the nobles smaller.

Therefore, the great should be made and unmade every day. Two types of great people might be encountered:
# Those who are bound to the prince: Concerning these it is important to distinguish between two types of obligated great people, those who are rapacious and those who are not. It is the latter who can and should be honoured.
# Those who are not bound to the new prince: Once again, these need to be divided into two types – those with a weak spirit (a prince can make use of them if they are of good counsel) and those who shun being bound because of their own ambition (these should be watched and feared as enemies).
How to win over people depends on circumstances: Machiavelli advises:
* Do not get frightened in adversity.
* One should avoid ruling via magistrates, if one wishes to be able to &quot;ascend&quot; to absolute rule quickly and safely. 
* One should make sure that the people need the prince, especially if a time of need should come.

===How to judge the strength of principalities (Chapter 10)===
The way to judge the strength of a princedom is to see whether it can defend itself, or whether it needs to depend on allies. This does not just mean that the cities should be prepared and the people trained; a prince who is hated is also exposed.

===Ecclesiastical principates (Chapter 11)===

This type of &quot;principality&quot; refers explicitly to the Catholic Church as an example, which is of course not traditionally thought of as a principality. According to Machiavelli, these are relatively easy to maintain, once founded. They do not need to defend themselves militarily, nor to govern their subjects. 

Machiavelli discusses the recent history of the Church as if it were a princedom that was in competition to conquer Italy against other princes. He points to factionalism as a historical weak point in the Church, and points to the recent example of the Borgia family as a better strategy which almost worked. He then explicitly proposes that the Medici are now in a position to try the same thing.

===Defense and military (Chapters 12–14)===
Having discussed the various types of principalities, Machiavelli turns to the ways a state can attack other territories or defend itself. The two most essential foundations for any state, whether old or new, are sound laws and strong military forces.
A self-sufficient prince is one who can meet any enemy on the battlefield. He should be &quot;armed&quot; with his own arms. However, a prince that relies solely on fortifications or on the help of others and stands on the defensive is not self-sufficient. If he cannot raise a formidable army, but must rely on defense, he must fortify his city. A well-fortified city is unlikely to be attacked, and if it is, most armies cannot endure an extended siege. However, during a siege a virtuous prince will keep the morale of his subjects high while removing all dissenters. Thus, as long as the city is properly defended and has enough supplies, a wise prince can withstand any siege.

Machiavelli stands strongly against the use of mercenaries, and in this he was innovative, and he also had personal experience in Florence. He believes they are useless to a ruler because they are undisciplined, cowardly, and without any loyalty, being motivated only by money. Machiavelli attributes the Italian city states&#x27; weakness to their reliance on mercenary armies.

Machiavelli also warns against using auxiliary forces, troops borrowed from an ally, because if they win, the employer is under their favor and if they lose, he is ruined. Auxiliary forces are more dangerous than mercenary forces because they are united and controlled by capable leaders who may turn against the employer.

The main concern for a prince should be war, or the preparation thereof, not books. Through war a hereditary prince maintains his power or a private citizen rises to power. Machiavelli advises that a prince must frequently hunt in order to keep his body fit and learn the landscape surrounding his kingdom. Through this, he can best learn how to protect his territory and advance upon others. For intellectual strength, he is advised to study great military men so he may imitate their successes and avoid their mistakes. A prince who is diligent in times of peace will be ready in times of adversity. Machiavelli writes, &quot;thus, when fortune turns against him he will be prepared to resist it.&quot;

===The Qualities of a Prince (Chapters 14–19)===
Each of the following chapters presents a discussion about a particular virtue or vice that a prince might have, and is therefore structured in a way which appears like traditional advice for a prince. However, the advice is far from traditional.

====A Prince&#x27;s Duty Concerning Military Matters (Chapter 14)====
Machiavelli believes that a prince&#x27;s main focus should be on perfecting the art of war. He believes that by taking this profession an aspiring prince will be able to acquire a state, and will be able to maintain what he has gained. He claims that &quot;being disarmed makes you despised.&quot; He believes that the only way to ensure loyalty from one&#x27;s soldiers is to understand military matters.
The two activities Machiavelli recommends practicing to prepare for war are physical and mental. Physically, he believes rulers should learn the landscape of their territories. Mentally, he encouraged the study of past military events. He also warns against idleness.

====Reputation of a prince (Chapter 15)====
Because, says Machiavelli, he wants to write something useful to those who understand, he thought it more fitting &quot;to go directly to the effectual truth (&quot;verità effettuale&quot;) of the thing than to the imagination of it&quot;. This section is one where Machiavelli&#x27;s pragmatic ideal can be seen most clearly. Machiavelli reasons that since princes come across men who are evil, he should learn how to be equally evil himself, and use this ability or not according to necessity. Concerning the behavior of a prince toward his subjects, Machiavelli announces that he will depart from what other writers say, and writes: 
Since there are many possible qualities that a prince can be said to possess, he must not be overly concerned about having all the good ones. Also, a prince may be perceived to be merciful, faithful, humane, frank, and religious, but most important is only to &quot;seem&quot; to have these qualities. A &quot;prince&quot; cannot truly have these qualities because at times it is &quot;necessary&quot; to act against them. Although a bad reputation should be avoided, it is sometimes necessary to have one. In fact, he must sometimes deliberately choose evil: 

====Generosity vs. parsimony (Chapter 16)====
If a prince is overly generous to his subjects, Machiavelli asserts he will not be appreciated, and will only cause greed for more. Additionally, being overly generous is not economical, because eventually all resources will be exhausted. This results in higher taxes, and will bring grief upon the prince. Then, if he decides to discontinue or limit his generosity, he will be labeled as a miser. Thus, Machiavelli summarizes that guarding against the people&#x27;s hatred is more important than building up a reputation for generosity. A wise prince should be willing to be more reputed a miser than be hated for trying to be too generous.

On the other hand: &quot;of what is not yours or your subjects&#x27; one can be a bigger giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander, because spending what is someone else&#x27;s does not take reputation from you but adds it to you; only spending your own hurts you&quot;.

====Cruelty vs. Mercy (Chapter 17)====

Machiavelli begins this chapter by addressing how mercy can be misused which will harm the prince and his dominion. He ends by stating that a prince should not shrink from being cruel if it means that it will keep his subjects in line. After all, it will help him maintain his rule. He gives the example of Cesare Borgia, whose cruelty protected him from rebellions. He contrasts this example with the leaders of Florence, who, through too much mercy, allowed the city of Pistoia to destroy itself.

In addressing the question of whether it is better to be loved or feared, Machiavelli writes, &quot;The answer is that one would like to be both the one and the other; but because it is difficult to combine them, it is far safer to be feared than loved if you cannot be both.&quot; As Machiavelli asserts, commitments made in peace are not always kept in adversity; however, commitments made in fear are kept out of fear. Yet, a prince must ensure that he is not feared to the point of hatred, which is very possible.

This chapter is possibly the most well-known of the work, and it is important because of the reasoning behind Machiavelli&#x27;s famous idea that it is better to be feared than loved. His justification is purely pragmatic; as he notes, &quot;Men worry less about doing an injury to one who makes himself loved than to one who makes himself feared.&quot; Fear is used as a means to ensure obedience from his subjects, and security for the prince. Above all, Machiavelli argues, a prince should not interfere with the property of their subjects or their women, and if they should try to kill someone, they should do it with a convenient justification.

Regarding the troops of the prince, fear is absolutely necessary to keep a large garrison united and a prince should not mind the thought of cruelty in that regard. For a prince who leads his own army, it is imperative for him to observe cruelty because that is the only way he can command his soldiers&#x27; absolute respect. Machiavelli compares two great military leaders: Hannibal and Scipio Africanus. Although Hannibal&#x27;s army consisted of men of various races, they were never rebellious because they feared their leader. Machiavelli says this required &quot;inhuman cruelty&quot; which he refers to as a virtue. Scipio&#x27;s men, on the other hand, were known for their mutiny and dissension, due to Scipio&#x27;s &quot;excessive mercy&quot; – which was, however, a source of glory because he lived in a republic.

====In what way princes should keep their word (Chapter 18)====
Machiavelli notes that a prince is praised for keeping his word. However, he also notes that in reality, the most cunning princes succeed politically. A prince, therefore, should only keep his word when it suits his purposes, but do his utmost to maintain the illusion that he does keep his word and that he is reliable in that regard. Machiavelli advises the ruler to become a &quot;great liar and deceiver&quot;, and that men are so easy to deceive, that the ruler won&#x27;t have an issue with lying to others. He justifies this by saying that men are wicked, and never keep their words, therefore the ruler doesn&#x27;t have to keep his.

As Machiavelli notes, &quot;He should appear to be compassionate, faithful to his word, guileless, and devout. And indeed he should be so. But his disposition should be such that, if he needs to be the opposite, he knows how.&quot; As noted in chapter 15, the prince must appear to be virtuous in order to hide his actions, and he should be able to be otherwise when the time calls for it; that includes being able to lie, though however much he lies he should always keep the appearance of being truthful.

In this chapter, Machiavelli uses &quot;beasts&quot; as a metaphor for unscrupulous behavior. He states that while lawful conduct is part of the nature of men, a prince should learn how to use the nature of both men and beasts wisely to ensure the stability of his regime. In this chapter however, his focus is solely on the &quot;beastly&quot; natures. In particular, he compares the use of force to the &quot;lion&quot;, and the use of deception to the &quot;fox&quot;, and advises the prince to study them both. In employing this metaphor, Machiavelli apparently references &quot;De Officiis&quot; by the Roman orator and statesman Cicero, and subverts its conclusion, arguing instead that dishonorable behavior is sometimes politically necessary.

====Avoiding contempt and hatred (Chapter 19)====
Machiavelli divides the fears which monarchs should have into internal (domestic) and external (foreign) fears. Internal fears exist inside his kingdom and focus on his subjects, Machiavelli warns to be suspicious of everyone when hostile attitudes emerge. Machiavelli observes that the majority of men are content as long as they are not deprived of their property and women, and only a minority of men are ambitious enough to be a concern. A prince should command respect through his conduct, because a prince who raises no contempt of the nobles and maintains the satisfaction of the people, Machiavelli assures, should have no fear of conspirators working with external powers. Conspiracy is very difficult and risky in such a situation.

Machiavelli apparently seems to go back on his rule that a prince can evade hate, as he says that he will eventually be hated by someone, so he should seek to avoid being hated by the commonfolk.

Roman emperors, on the other hand, had not only the majority and ambitious minority, but also a cruel and greedy military, who created extra problems as they demanded iniquity. While a prince should avoid being hated, he will eventually be hated by someone, so he must at least avoid the hatred of the most powerful, and for the Roman emperors this included the military who demanded iniquity against the people out of their own greed. He uses Septimius Severus as a model for new rulers to emulate, as he &quot;embodied both the fox and the lion&quot;. Severus outwitted and killed his military rivals, and although he oppressed the people, Machiavelli says that he kept the common people &quot;satisfied and stupified&quot;.

Machiavelli notes that in his time only the Turkish empire had the problem of the Romans, because in other lands the people had become more powerful than the military.

===The Prudence of the Prince (Chapters 20–25)===
====Whether ruling conquests with fortresses works (Chapter 20)====
Machiavelli mentions that placing fortresses in conquered territories, although it sometimes works, often fails. Using fortresses can be a good plan, but Machiavelli says he shall &quot;blame anyone who, trusting in fortresses, thinks little of being hated by the people&quot;. He cited Caterina Sforza, who used a fortress to defend herself but was eventually betrayed by her people.

====Gaining honours (Chapter 21)====
A prince truly earns honour by completing great feats. King Ferdinand of Spain is cited by Machiavelli as an example of a monarch who gained esteem by showing his ability through great feats and who, in the name of religion, conquered many territories and kept his subjects occupied so that they had no chance to rebel.
Regarding two warring states, Machiavelli asserts it is always wiser to choose a side, rather than to be neutral. Machiavelli then provides the following reasons why:
* If your allies win, you benefit whether or not you have more power than they have.
* If you are more powerful, then your allies are under your command; if your allies are stronger, they will always feel a certain obligation to you for your help.
* If your side loses, you still have an ally in the loser.
Machiavelli also notes that it is wise for a prince not to ally with a stronger force unless compelled to do so. In conclusion, the most important virtue is having the wisdom to discern what ventures will come with the most reward and then pursuing them courageously.

====Nobles and staff (Chapter 22)====
The selection of good servants is reflected directly upon the prince&#x27;s intelligence, so if they are loyal, the prince is considered wise; however, when they are otherwise, the prince is open to adverse criticism. Machiavelli asserts that there are three types of intelligence:
* The kind that understands things for itself – which is excellent to have.
* The kind that understands what others can understand – which is good to have.
* The kind that does not understand for itself, nor through others – which is useless to have.

If the prince does not have the first type of intelligence, he should at the very least have the second type. For, as Machiavelli states, &quot;A prince needs to have the discernment to recognize the good or bad in what another says or does even though he has no acumen himself&quot;.

====Avoiding flatterers (Chapter 23)====
This chapter displays a low opinion of flatterers; Machiavelli notes that &quot;Men are so happily absorbed in their own affairs and indulge in such self-deception that it is difficult for them not to fall victim to this plague; and some efforts to protect oneself from flatterers involve the risk of becoming despised.&quot; Flatterers were seen as a great danger to a prince, because their flattery could cause him to avoid wise counsel in favor of rash action, but avoiding all advice, flattery or otherwise, was equally bad; a middle road had to be taken. A prudent prince should have a select group of wise counselors to advise him truthfully on matters all the time. All their opinions should be taken into account. Ultimately, the decision should be made by the prince and carried out absolutely. If a prince is given to changing his mind, his reputation will suffer. A prince must have the wisdom to recognize good advice from bad. Machiavelli gives a negative example in Emperor Maximilian I; Maximilian, who was secretive, never consulted others, but once he ordered his plans and met dissent, he immediately changed them.

===Prudence and chance===
====Why the princes of Italy lost their states (Chapter 24)====
After first mentioning that a new prince can quickly become as respected as a hereditary one, Machiavelli says princes in Italy who had longstanding power and lost it cannot blame bad luck, but should blame their own indolence. One &quot;should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up&quot;. They all showed a defect of arms (already discussed) and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great.

====How Much Fortune Can Do in Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed (Chapter 25)====
As pointed out by it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but &quot;Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work&quot;. Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with &quot;sweat&quot;, prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances.

Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that &quot;it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.&quot; Gilbert (p. 217) points out that Machiavelli&#x27;s friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune.

Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to &quot;fortune and God&quot;. Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled.

====Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians (Chapter 26)====
Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book. showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family&#x27;s position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family&#x27;s &quot;recent&quot; and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed. This continues a controversial theme throughout the book.

==Analysis==

As shown by his letter of dedication, Machiavelli&#x27;s work eventually came to be dedicated to Lorenzo di Piero de&#x27; Medici, grandson of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and a member of the ruling Florentine Medici family, whose uncle Giovanni became Pope Leo X in 1513. It is known from his personal correspondence that it was written during 1513, the year after the Medici regained control of Florence, and a few months after Machiavelli&#x27;s arrest, torture, and banishment by the in-coming Medici regime. It was discussed for a long time with Francesco Vettori – a friend of Machiavelli – whom he wanted to pass it and commend it to the Medici. The book had originally been intended for Giuliano di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, young Lorenzo&#x27;s uncle, who however died in 1516. It is not certain that the work was ever read by any of the Medici before it was printed. Machiavelli describes the contents as being an un-embellished summary of his knowledge about the nature of princes and &quot;the actions of great men&quot;, based not only on reading but also, unusually, on real experience.

The types of political behavior which are discussed with apparent approval by Machiavelli in &quot;The Prince&quot; were regarded as shocking by contemporaries, and its immorality is still a subject of serious discussion. Although the work advises princes how to tyrannize, Machiavelli is generally thought to have preferred some form of republican government. Some commentators justify his acceptance of immoral and criminal actions by leaders by arguing that he lived during a time of continuous political conflict and instability in Italy, and that his influence has increased the &quot;pleasures, equality and freedom&quot; of many people, loosening the grip of medieval Catholicism&#x27;s &quot;classical teleology&quot;, which &quot;disregarded not only the needs of individuals and the wants of the common man, but stifled innovation, enterprise, and enquiry into cause and effect relationships that now allow us to control nature&quot;.

On the other hand, notes that &quot;even if we were forced to grant that Machiavelli was essentially a patriot or a scientist, we would not be forced to deny that he was a teacher of evil&quot;. Furthermore, Machiavelli &quot;was too thoughtful not to know what he was doing and too generous not to admit it to his reasonable friends&quot;.

Machiavelli emphasized the need for looking at the &quot;effectual truth&quot; (), as opposed to relying on &quot;imagined republics and principalities&quot;. He states the difference between honorable behavior and criminal behavior by using the metaphor of animals, saying that &quot;there are two ways of contending, one in accordance with the laws, the other by force; the first of which is proper to men, the second to beast&quot;. In &quot;The Prince&quot; he does not explain what he thinks the best ethical or political goals are, except the control of one&#x27;s own fortune, as opposed to waiting to see what chance brings. Machiavelli took it for granted that would-be leaders naturally aim at glory or honour. He associated these goals with a need for &quot;virtue&quot; and &quot;prudence&quot; in a leader, and saw such virtues as essential to good politics. That great men should develop and use their virtue and prudence was a traditional theme of advice to Christian princes. And that more virtue meant less reliance on chance was a classically influenced &quot;humanist commonplace&quot; in Machiavelli&#x27;s time, as says, even if it was somewhat controversial. However, Machiavelli went far beyond other authors in his time, who in his opinion left things to fortune, and therefore to bad rulers, because of their Christian beliefs. He used the words &quot;virtue&quot; and &quot;prudence&quot; to refer to glory-seeking and spirited excellence of character, in strong contrast to the traditional Christian uses of those terms, but more keeping with the original pre-Christian Greek and Roman concepts from which they derived. He encouraged ambition and risk taking. So in another break with tradition, he treated not only stability, but also radical innovation, as possible aims of a prince in a political community. Managing major reforms can show off a Prince&#x27;s virtue and give him glory. He clearly felt Italy needed major reform in his time, and this opinion of his time is widely shared.

Machiavelli&#x27;s descriptions encourage leaders to attempt to control their fortune gloriously, to the extreme extent that some situations may call for a fresh &quot;founding&quot; (or re-founding) of the &quot;modes and orders&quot; that define a community, despite the danger and necessary evil and lawlessness of such a project. Founding a wholly new state, or even a new religion, using injustice and immorality has even been called the chief theme of &quot;The Prince&quot;. Machiavelli justifies this position by explaining how if &quot;a prince did not win love he may escape hate&quot; by personifying injustice and immorality; therefore, he will never loosen his grip since &quot;fear is held by the apprehension of punishment&quot; and never diminishes as time goes by. For a political theorist to do this in public was one of Machiavelli&#x27;s clearest breaks not just with medieval scholasticism, but with the classical tradition of political philosophy, especially the favorite philosopher of Catholicism at the time, Aristotle. This is one of Machiavelli&#x27;s most lasting influences upon modernity.

Nevertheless, Machiavelli was heavily influenced by classical pre-Christian political philosophy. According to Machiavelli refers to Xenophon more than Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero put together. Xenophon wrote one of the classic mirrors of princes, the &quot;Education of Cyrus&quot;. wrote: &quot;The Cyrus of Xenophon was a hero to many a literary man of the sixteenth century, but for Machiavelli he lived&quot;. Xenophon also, as Strauss pointed out, wrote a dialogue, &quot;Hiero&quot; which showed a wise man dealing sympathetically with a tyrant, coming close to what Machiavelli would do in uprooting the ideal of &quot;the imagined prince&quot;. Xenophon however, like Plato and Aristotle, was a follower of Socrates, and his works show approval of a &quot;teleological argument&quot;, while Machiavelli rejected such arguments. On this matter, gives evidence that Machiavelli may have seen himself as having learned something from Democritus, Epicurus and classical materialism, which was however not associated with political realism, or even any interest in politics.

On the topic of rhetoric Machiavelli, in his introduction, stated that &quot;I have not embellished or crammed this book with rounded periods or big, impressive words, or with any blandishment or superfluous decoration of the kind which many are in the habit of using to describe or adorn what they have produced&quot;. This has been interpreted as showing a distancing from traditional rhetoric styles, but there are echoes of classical rhetoric in several areas. In Chapter 18, for example, he uses a metaphor of a lion and a fox, examples of force and cunning; according to , &quot;the Roman author from whom Machiavelli in all likelihood drew the simile of the lion and the fox&quot; was Cicero. The &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot;, a work which was believed during Machiavelli&#x27;s time to have been written by Cicero, was used widely to teach rhetoric, and it is likely that Machiavelli was familiar with it. Unlike Cicero&#x27;s more widely accepted works however, according to , &quot;Ad Herennium ... offers a model of an ethical system that not only condones the practice of force and deception but appears to regard them as habitual and indeed germane to political activity&quot;. This makes it an ideal text for Machiavelli to have used.

==Influence==
To quote :

Machiavelli&#x27;s ideas on how to accrue honour and power as a leader had a profound impact on political leaders throughout the modern West, helped by the new technology of the printing press. Pole reported that it was spoken of highly by his enemy Thomas Cromwell in England, and had influenced Henry VIII in his turn towards Protestantism, and in his tactics, for example during the Pilgrimage of Grace. A copy was also possessed by the Catholic king and emperor Charles V. In France, after an initially mixed reaction, Machiavelli came to be associated with Catherine de Medici and the St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre. As reports, in the 16th century, Catholic writers &quot;associated Machiavelli with the Protestants, whereas Protestant authors saw him as Italian and Catholic&quot;. In fact, he was apparently influencing both Catholic and Protestant kings.

One of the most important early works dedicated to criticism of Machiavelli, especially &quot;The Prince&quot;, was that of the Huguenot, Innocent Gentillet, &quot;Discourse against Machiavelli&quot;, commonly also referred to as &quot;Anti Machiavel&quot;, published in Geneva in 1576. He accused Machiavelli of being an atheist and accused politicians of his time by saying that they treated his works as the &quot;Koran of the courtiers&quot;. Another theme of Gentillet was more in the spirit of Machiavelli himself: he questioned the effectiveness of immoral strategies (just as Machiavelli had himself done, despite also explaining how they could sometimes work). This became the theme of much future political discourse in Europe during the 17th century. This includes the Catholic Counter Reformation writers summarised by Bireley: Giovanni Botero, Justus Lipsius, Carlo Scribani, Adam Contzen, Pedro de Ribadeneira, and Diego de Saavedra Fajardo. These authors criticized Machiavelli, but also followed him in many ways. They accepted the need for a prince to be concerned with reputation, and even a need for cunning and deceit, but compared to Machiavelli, and like later modernist writers, they emphasized economic progress much more than the riskier ventures of war. These authors tended to cite Tacitus as their source for realist political advice, rather than Machiavelli, and this pretense came to be known as &quot;Tacitism&quot;.

Modern materialist philosophy developed in the 16th, 17th and 18th century, starting in the generations after Machiavelli. The importance of Machiavelli&#x27;s realism was noted by many important figures in this endeavor, for example Jean Bodin, Francis Bacon, Harrington, John Milton, Spinoza, Rousseau, Hume, Edward Gibbon, and Adam Smith. Although he was not always mentioned by name as an inspiration, due to his controversy, he is also thought to have been an influence for other major philosophers, such as Montaigne, Descartes, Hobbes, Locke and Montesquieu.

In literature:
* Machiavelli is featured as a character in the prologue of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot;.
* In William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Othello&quot;, the antagonist Iago has been noted by some literary critics as being archetypal in adhering to Machiavelli&#x27;s ideals by advancing himself through machination and duplicity with the consequence of causing the demise of both Othello and Desdemona.

Amongst later political leaders:
* The republicanism in seventeenth-century England which led to the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution and subsequent development of the English Constitution was strongly influenced by Machiavelli&#x27;s political thought.
* Most of the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution are known or often proposed to have been strongly influenced by Machiavelli&#x27;s political works, including Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton and John Adams.
* Under the guidance of Voltaire, Frederick the Great of Prussia criticised Machiavelli&#x27;s conclusions in his &quot;Anti-Machiavel&quot;, published in 1740.
* At different stages in his life, Napoleon I of France wrote extensive comments to &quot;The Prince&quot;. After his defeat at Waterloo, these comments were found in the emperor&#x27;s coach and taken by the Prussian military.
* Italian dictator Benito Mussolini wrote a discourse on &quot;The Prince&quot;.
* Soviet leader Joseph Stalin read &quot;The Prince&quot; and annotated his own copy.
20th-century Italian-American mobsters were influenced by &quot;The Prince&quot;. John Gotti and Roy DeMeo would regularly quote &quot;The Prince&quot; and consider it to be the &quot;Mafia Bible&quot;.

Rapper Tupac Shakur read &quot;The Prince&quot; while in prison recovering from an attempt on his life. After he was released he used a pseudonym &quot;Makaveli&quot;, referencing Machiavelli. Death Row Records released &quot;The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory&quot; the posthumous album under the name of Makaveli.

==Interpretations==

===Satire===
This interpretation was famously put forth by scholar Garrett Mattingly (1958), who stated that &quot;In some ways, Machiavelli&#x27;s little treatise was just like all the other &#x27;Mirrors of Princes&#x27;, in other ways it was a diabolical burlesque of all of them, like a political Black Mass.&quot;

This position was taken up previously by some of the more prominent Enlightenment &quot;philosophes&quot;. Diderot speculated that it was a work designed not to mock, but to secretly expose corrupt princely rule. And in his &quot;The Social Contract&quot;, the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau said: 

Whether or not the word &quot;satire&quot; is the best choice, the interpretation is very rare amongst those who study Machiavelli&#x27;s works. For example Isaiah Berlin states that he cannot find anything other than Machiavelli&#x27;s work that &quot;reads less&quot; like a satirical piece.

===Deceit===
Mary Dietz, in her essay &quot;Trapping The Prince&quot;, writes that Machiavelli&#x27;s agenda was not to be satirical, as Rousseau had argued, but instead was &quot;offering carefully crafted advice (such as arming the people) designed to undo the ruler if taken seriously and followed.&quot; By this account, the aim was to reestablish the republic in Florence. She focuses on three categories in which Machiavelli gives paradoxical advice:
* He discourages liberality and favors deceit to guarantee support from the people. Yet Machiavelli is keenly aware of the fact that an earlier pro-republican coup had been thwarted by the people&#x27;s inaction that itself stemmed from the prince&#x27;s liberality.
* He supports arming the people despite the fact that he knows the Florentines are decidedly pro-democratic and would oppose the prince.
* He encourages the prince to live in the city he conquers. This opposes the Medici&#x27;s habitual policy of living outside the city. It also makes it easier for rebels or a civilian militia to attack and overthrow the prince.

According to Dietz, the trap never succeeded because Lorenzo – &quot;a suspicious prince&quot; – apparently never read the work of the &quot;former republican.&quot;

===Other interpretations===
The Italian Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci argued that Machiavelli&#x27;s audience for this work was not the classes who already rule (or have &quot;hegemony&quot;) over the common people, but the common people themselves, trying to establish a new hegemony, and making Machiavelli the first &quot;Italian Jacobin&quot;.

Hans Baron is one of the few major commentators who argues that Machiavelli must have changed his mind dramatically in favour of free republics, after having written &quot;The Prince&quot;.

<text>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is a 2001 American satirical stoner buddy comedy film written, co-edited, and directed by Kevin Smith and produced and co-edited by Scott Mosier. The film is the fifth set in the View Askewniverse, a growing collection of characters and settings that developed out of Smith&#x27;s cult-favorite &quot;Clerks&quot;. It stars Jason Mewes and Smith respectively as the two eponymous characters. The film also stars Shannon Elizabeth, Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Will Ferrell, Eliza Dushku, Ali Larter, and Chris Rock, among many others, most of which make cameo appearances. The title and logo for &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; are direct references to &quot;The Empire Strikes Back.&quot;

Originally intended to be the last film set in the Askewniverse, or to feature Jay and Silent Bob, &quot;Strike Back&quot; features many characters from the previous Askew films, some in dual roles and/or reprising roles from the previous four entries. The film received mixed reviews from critics.

Smith announced in February 2017 that he was writing a sequel called &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot; and started filming in February 2019 and was released on October 15 that same year. From February to June 2019, Smith additionally re-adapted the plot of the film to the character of Mindy McCready / Hit-Girl in the relaunched Image comic book series, titled &quot;Hit-Girl: The Golden Rage of Hollywood&quot;, with Dave Lizewski filling the role of Banky Edwards.

==Plot==
Dante Hicks and Randal Graves get a restraining order against Jay and Silent Bob, finally fed up with their drug dealing outside the strip mall where they work after Jay and Silent Bob tell a pair of teenagers that they were married in a Star Wars-themed wedding. Not allowed within 100 feet of the strip mall for at least a year, Jay and Silent Bob visit Brodie Bruce at his comic shop where they learn that Miramax Films is adapting &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot;, the comic book based on their likenesses.

The pair visit Holden McNeil, co-creator and co-writer of &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot;, and demand that he give them their royalty money from the film, but Holden explains he sold his half of the rights to co-creator and artist Banky Edwards. Seeing the film&#x27;s negative reception online, the pair set out for Hollywood to prevent the film from ruining their image, or at least to receive the royalties owed to them.

En route, they befriend an animal liberation group: Justice, Sissy, Missy, Chrissy, and Brent. The organization is a front; Brent is a patsy, who will free animals from a laboratory as a diversion while the girls rob a diamond depository. Jay throws Brent out of their van to get closer to Justice, to whom he is attracted to. Justice is fond of the pair, but reluctantly accepts them as new patsies. While the girls steal the diamonds, Jay and Silent Bob free the animals, stealing an orangutan named Suzanne. They escape as the police arrive and the van explodes, believing the girls have perished.

Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly (whose name is taken from &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; characters ) arrives at the crime scene; oblivious to the diamond heist, he claims jurisdiction due to the escaped animals, all of which have been recovered but Suzanne. The police find footage of a video Sissy made of Jay claiming to be &quot;the clit commander&quot;, with &quot;Clit&quot; edited to be an acronym for &quot;Coalition for the Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers&quot;. Willenholly declares the crime an act of terrorism and calls for backup to hunt &quot;the two most dangerous men on the planet.&quot; He finds Jay and Silent Bob at a diner near Vasquez Rocks, and chases them into the sewer system of a nearby dam. Suzanne helps the duo in losing Willenholly by luring him off the dam, but is subsequently abducted by a Hollywood animal acting agency.

The duo then hitch a ride and arrive in Hollywood, and eventually, the Miramax lot. Chased by a team of security guards through the lot and several movie sets, including &quot;Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season&quot;, and reclaiming Suzanne from the set of &quot;Scream 4&quot;, Jay and Silent Bob end up in the dressing room of Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek, the actors playing Bluntman and Chronic respectively in the film. Suzanne beats up the actors, knocking them out, and Jay and Silent Bob assume the roles while Van Der Beek and Biggs are arrested after getting mistaken for the duo.

Meeting the film&#x27;s anti-white director Chaka Luther King, who mistakes them for Biggs and Van Der Beek&#x27;s stunt doubles, Jay and Silent Bob are then escorted onto the set and forced to fight Mark Hamill, playing the supervillain of the film Cocknocker (a combination of Hamill&#x27;s roles as The Joker, The Trickster, and Luke Skywalker) in a Star Wars-esque battle. Willenholly, armed with a shotgun, arrives to capture the pair, but Justice protects them, admitting the CLIT organization was only a diversion. The other thieves arrive and a climactic gun fight ensues. Jay and Silent Bob locate Banky and demand that he shut down production of the movie. Banky refuses on account of both the large sum of money Miramax offered him for the film and that the internet will continue to troll them regardless. Silent Bob then informs Banky that he violated their original likeness rights contract by selling the film rights of Bluntman and Chronic to Miramax without their permission, and therefore could face legal trouble if he doesn&#x27;t give them their legally entitled royalties. Banky finally relents and agrees to give the duo half of his payment for the film.

Justice then turns herself and her former team in to Willenholly in exchange for a shorter sentence and dropping the charges on Jay and Silent Bob. The duo spend their royalty money locating everyone who mocked them, their characters, and the movie on the internet, including children and members of the clergy, and travel to assault them. The scene cuts to the El Rey theater where a bunch of people exit, including Dante, Randal, Banky, Steve-Dave Pulski, Walt &quot;The Fanboy&quot; Grover, Willam Black, Hooper LaMonte, and sisters Alyssa and Tricia Jones, having just watched the &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; movie, to poor reception. Jay and Silent Bob, accompanied by Justice and Willenholly (now an FBI agent), go across the street to enjoy the after party, featuring a performance from Morris Day and The Time.

After the credits, God (&quot;Dogma&quot;) closes the View Askewniverse book.

==Cast==
Additionally, Wes Craven, Jules Asner, Steve Kmetko, Gus Van Sant, Jason Biggs, James Van Der Beek, Shannen Doherty, and Morris Day all appear as themselves.

==Production==
The film&#x27;s plot was heavily inspired by &quot;Chasing Dogma&quot;, a comic book miniseries that Smith wrote in 1998 and 1999 to explore events that happened in the Askewniverse between &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and &quot;Dogma&quot;.

The film was originally titled &quot;View Askew 5&quot; and the title was changed to &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;. Filming began on January 14, 2001, and ended on April 19, 2001. Filming took in place in New Jersey, and mostly in California.

On his podcast &quot;Jay &amp; Silent Bob Get Old&quot;, Kevin Smith explained at length about how much of a &quot;headache&quot; the film was to make, mostly owing to Jason Mewes&#x27;s drug and alcohol abuse turning him into a &quot;ticking time bomb&quot;, which threatened to shut the project down at any moment. During pre-production, Mewes would have constant mood swings due to heroin withdrawal, to the point that Smith actually threw him out of his car on their way to the set one day. Mewes would compensate for his lack of drugs by drinking heavily after every day of shooting and nearly got into a fist fight with producer Scott Mosier when he had to come back one night for a re-shoot while drunk. When filming wrapped, Smith told Mewes point-blank to get sober or he would never speak to him again.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; grossed $30.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $3.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $33.8 million, against a production budget of $22 million.

The film grossed $11 million in its opening weekend, finishing third at the box office behind two other comedy sequels, &quot;American Pie 2&quot; ($12.5 million) and &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; ($11.6 million).

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; has an approval rating of 52% based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 5.60/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Fans can expect a good laugh as the cast from Smith&#x27;s previous films reunite for Jay and Silent Bob&#x27;s last bow. The loose plotting and crude language may be too much for others though.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, writing that &quot;[w]hether you will like &#x27;Jay and Silent Bob&#x27; depends on who you are ... Kevin Smith&#x27;s movies are either made specifically for you, or specifically not made for you&quot;. Adam Smith of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film 3/5 stars, writing that &quot;[w]hen it&#x27;s good it&#x27;s very, very good, but when it&#x27;s bad it&#x27;s offensive&quot;, and noting that &quot;the gag hit/miss ratio is really only about 50/50&quot;. Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that &quot;[e]ven at a slim 95 minutes, &quot;Jay And Silent Bob&quot; lets initially funny scenes trail off into long-winded monologues and silly digressions&quot;, and Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;[may]be the greatest picture ever made for 14-year-old boys. Mr. Smith may have hit his target, but he aimed very low.&quot; In August 2001, Mike Schulz of &quot;River Cities&#x27; Reader&quot; wrote that, &quot;for sheer laughs, both mindless and incredibly smart, nothing since 1997&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; has even compared.&quot;

===Home media===
&quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; was released on VHS and on a two-disc DVD set on February 26, 2002, by Dimension Home Video as a part of their &quot;Dimension Collector&#x27;s Series&quot;, presented in its original 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio. Among the bonus features on the DVD is an audio commentary by Smith, Mosier, and Mewes, 42 deleted, extended, and alternate scenes, music videos for Stroke 9&#x27;s &quot;Kick Some Ass&quot; and Afroman&#x27;s &quot;Because I Got High&quot;, storyboards, a gag reel, a behind the scenes special, still galleries, cast and crew filmographies, and TV spots. A Blu-ray version of the film was released on September 19, 2006, with all features carried over from the DVD. As for 2020, the film&#x27;s home media distribution has been handled by Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment following Paramount Global&#x27;s purchase of 49% of Miramax (which includes Dimension Films&#x27; pre-2006 film and television catalog).

==Soundtrack==
&quot;Music from the Dimension Motion Picture: Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, the soundtrack to the film, was released on August 14, 2001, by Universal Records. Varèse Sarabande released the original score by James L. Venable. It alternates film dialogue with songs of various genres that appear in the film. It features the 2001 Afroman hit, &quot;Because I Got High&quot;, whose music video featured the characters Jay and Silent Bob. &quot;Tube Of Wonderful&quot; was previously used as the theme song from Smith&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;.

===Track listing===
Other songs that featured in the film but weren&#x27;t included on the soundtrack album include &quot;Life&#x27;s Been Good&quot; by Joe Walsh, &quot;Too Much Heaven&quot; by The Bee Gees, and Jason Mewes&#x27; cover of &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot; by Ice Cube.

==MPAA rating and GLAAD controversy==
In August 2001, three weeks prior to release, the film came under fire from the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), for an alleged &quot;overwhelmingly homophobic tone&quot;, which included an abundance of gay jokes and characters excessively using the term &quot;gay&quot; to mean something derogatory. The scenes deemed particularly offensive included Jay&#x27;s vehement refusal of giving oral sex to a male driver when hitchhiking, and Jay chastising Silent Bob for being willing to perform fellatio on him to get the security guard to let them go. Following an advance screening of the film, former GLAAD media director Scott Seomin asked Smith to make a $10,000 donation to the Matthew Shepard Foundation, as well as to include a reference to GLAAD&#x27;s cause in the ending credits. Roger Ebert responded to this controversy, writing: &quot;GLAAD should give audiences credit for enough intelligence to know the difference between satire and bigotry.&quot;

On the bonus DVD, Smith explains in the on-camera intros of the deleted scenes that several scenes had to be cut from the theatrical release, due to the film initially receiving an NC-17 rating from the MPAA. He also mentions in the audio commentary of the feature film that it took three submissions to the MPAA for the film to finally earn an R rating.

==Notes==
According to Ethan Alter of &quot;Film Journal International&quot;, Smith did not intend to make another View Askewniverse film upon completion of &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, but only decided to do so several years later, following the unsuccessful release of &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;.

Will Ferrell would later star in the 2009 film adaptation of &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; as Dr. Rick Marshall alongside Danny McBride as Will Stanton and Anna Friel as Holly Cantrell.

<text>Mira Furlan (7 September 1955 – 20 January 2021) was a Croatian-American actress and singer. Internationally, she was best known for her roles as the Minbari Ambassador Delenn in the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (1993–1998), and as Danielle Rousseau in &quot;Lost&quot; (2004–2010), and also appeared in multiple award-winning films such as &quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Abandoned&quot; (2010).

==Early life==
Furlan was born on 7 September 1955 to an intellectual and academic family that included a large number of university professors in Zagreb, PR Croatia, which at the time was one of the six constituent republics of Yugoslavia. She was born to Branka Weil, a mother who was of Jewish - Serbian descent, and Ivan Furlan, a father of Slovene - 
Croat descent.

As a child, Furlan was obsessed with American rock and roll music. She became interested in acting as a teenager.

Furlan graduated from the Academy for Dramatic Arts in Zagreb with Bachelor of Fine Arts in theatre. Simultaneously, she took language classes at the university&#x27;s Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, becoming fluent in English, German, and French.

==Career==
===Acting===
Furlan was a member of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb and frequently appeared in Yugoslav television and films. She played Ankica Vidmar in the film &quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot;, which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In the late 1980s, she performed in theater productions in both Zagreb and Belgrade.

Furlan became a member of the Actors Studio in 1992 after moving to New York City to flee turmoil in Yugoslavia. Later that year, her theater contacts in the U.S. helped her get the necessary work permits to perform with the Indiana Repertory Theatre as the lead role in &quot;Yerma&quot;.

She appeared on the stage in New York City and Los Angeles. She played the central ensemble role of Minbari Ambassador Delenn for all five seasons of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, and some of the associated TV movies. Between 2004 and 2010 she played the recurring role of Danielle Rousseau on &quot;Lost&quot;. In 2009, she appeared on an episode of &quot;NCIS&quot;, titled &quot;South By Southwest&quot;.

In 2002, she returned to Croatia after eleven years to take the lead role in Rade Šerbedžija&#x27;s Ulysses Theatre Company&#x27;s production of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea&quot;.

===Singing===
In the 1980s, Furlan briefly appeared as singer for Le Cinema, a spin-off from the rock band, Film. She was also featured as a vocalist on two tracks on the 1983 album, &quot;Nevino srce&quot; (&quot;Innocent Heart&quot;) by Slovenian rock band, Buldožer. In 1998, she released an album, &quot;Songs From Movies That Have Never Been Made&quot;.

Furlan also sang in the band, The Be Five, which produced a single album in 1998, &quot;Trying to Forget&quot;.

===Writing===
Furlan wrote the play &quot;Until Death Do Us Part&quot; (), which is set in 1970s Zagreb. A collection of her columns in the now-defunct Croatian magazine &quot;Feral Tribune&quot; was published as the book &quot;Totalna rasprodaja&quot; in 2010. Furlan chose to write her autobiography in English: &quot;Love Me More than Anything in the World: Stories about Belonging&quot;. The book is not only a self-portrait of the actress, but also a picture of the disintegration of the Yugoslavian country and its moral values.

==Personal life==
Furlan&#x27;s husband was director Goran Gajić, who is an ethnic Serb. He directed her in an episode of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and in several plays, including a production of Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot;.

Furlan was active in the Yugoslav feminist movement in the 1980s.

Twice a month during the late 1980s, Furlan made the three-hour commute between Zagreb and Belgrade, where her husband was based, to act in theater productions in both cities. After the Croatian War of Independence began in 1991, she was fired by the Croatian National Theater for refusing to quit acting in a Belgrade theater production. An ensuing public smear campaign turned her colleagues and friends against her as she received threatening messages on her answering machine. Furlan wrote a public letter expressing her deep disappointment over the behaviour of her fellow citizens and colleagues and the threats of the nationalists against her. The couple left in November 1991, in the early days of the breakup of Yugoslavia, emigrating to New York City.

Furlan gave birth to the couple&#x27;s only child, Marko Lav, in 1998.

==Death==
Furlan died at her home in Los Angeles on January 20, 2021, at the age of 65, having suffered from complications of West Nile fever in the time leading up to her death. Upon her death, theater director Ivica Buljan of the Croatian National Theater issued an apology on behalf of the theater for their treatment of Furlan in the early 1990s. A week later, Croatian weekly &quot;Globus&quot; issued another apology for publishing three &quot;feuilletons&quot; attacking the actress in 1992 that had an essential role in the public-smear campaign.

<doc id="101555" wikidata="Q433000" url="?curid=101555" title="When Father Was Away on Business">
<text>When Father Was Away on Business () is a 1985 Yugoslav film by director Emir Kusturica. The screenplay was written by the dramatist Abdulah Sidran. Its subtitle is &quot;A Historical Love Film&quot; and it was produced by Centar Film and Forum, production companies based in Sarajevo.

Set in post-World War II Yugoslavia during the Informbiro period, the film tells the story from the perspective of a boy, Malik, whose father Meša (Miki Manojlović) was sent to a labour camp. &quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

==Plot==
In June 1950, a local neighbourhood drunk, Čika Franjo, serenades field workers. He sings Mexican songs out of self-preservation, figuring it&#x27;s safer for him to steer clear of songs originating from either of the two dominant global superpowers—the United States and the Soviet Union—in the prevailing climate of the Cold War. Yugoslavia is experiencing a paranoid and repressive internal apparatus looking to identify and remove enemies of the state in the wake of the Tito–Stalin Split. The local children, including Malik, climb trees and play around. Malik&#x27;s mother, Sena, tells him that his father is on a business trip, while Malik is a chronic sleepwalker. His father, communist functionary Meša, was, in fact, sent to a labour camp by his own brother-in-law, Sena&#x27;s brother Zijo, who is an even higher-positioned Communist functionary. Meša had made a remark about a political cartoon regarding the Tito–Stalin Split in the &quot;Politika&quot; newspaper.

After a while, Meša&#x27;s wife and children rejoin him in Zvornik. Malik meets and falls in love with Maša, the daughter of a Russian doctor, but last sees her when an ambulance takes her away.

At the wedding of his maternal uncle Fahro, Malik witnesses his father&#x27;s affair with a woman pilot. She later tries to commit suicide by using a toilet&#x27;s flush cord. Sena reconciles with her brother Zijah, who has been diagnosed with diabetes.

== Cast ==
==Reception==
The writer Danilo Kiš described the film as &quot;an artistic and moral endeavour.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin credited the film for &quot; a humorous, richly detailed portrait&quot; of its characters. &quot;Time&quot; critic Richard Corliss said the film was worth seeing despite the lack of glamorous settings or characters. &quot;Variety&quot; staff called it &quot;rather witty commentary&quot; and compared it to Czechoslovak comedy films in the 1960s. John Simon of the National Review described When Father Was Away on Business as &quot;a film of undaunted honesty and unswerving intelligence, borne out aloft by humor, heartache, satire and compassion-an unbeatable combination&quot;.

In his &quot;2015 Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin awarded it three and a half stars, praising it as &quot;Captivating&quot;. In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked it the 26th best film to win the Palme d&#x27;Or, citing it for depicting how &quot;humor and the almost mystical power of family trumps all.&quot;

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited this movie as one of his 100 favorite films.

===Accolades===
&quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot; marked Emir Kusturica&#x27;s first time winning the Palme d&#x27;Or, the highest honour at the Cannes Film Festival. He won his second in 1995 for &quot;Underground&quot;.

<text>Andrell D. Rogers (born May 1, 1973), better known as Kilo Ali, formerly Kilo, is an American rapper from Atlanta, Georgia. Kilo Ali recorded mainly bass music (described more closely to Miami bass style music), but also hip-hop tracks with a less distinctive Southern flavor. His most well known singles include &quot;Show Me Love&quot;, &quot;Baby Baby&quot;, and &quot;Love In Ya Mouth&quot;.

As Kilo Ali, he released &quot;Organized Bass&quot; in 1997 on Interscope, with featured artists including George Clinton, Cee-Lo of Goodie Mob, Big Boi of OutKast, and JT Money. In 2011, Ali was released from prison after serving six years of a 15-year sentence for arson. In June 2021, Ali sued rapper NLE Choppa for copyright infringement for unauthorized use of his 1997 song, &quot;Love In Ya Mouth&quot;.

Ali’s track &quot;America Has a Problem (Cocaine)&quot; was sampled on Beyoncé’s 2023 single &quot;America Has a Problem&quot; from her Grammy Award winning 2022 album, &quot;Renaissance&quot;.

<doc id="101567" wikidata="Q281853" url="?curid=101567" title="Naqoyqatsi">
<text>Naqoyqatsi is a 2002 American non-narrative film directed by Godfrey Reggio and edited by Jon Kane, with music composed by Philip Glass. It is the third and final installment in the &quot;Qatsi&quot; trilogy.

The title comes from the Hopi word meaning &quot;life of war&quot;. In the film&#x27;s closing credits, the title is also translated as &quot;civilized violence&quot; and &quot;a life of killing each other&quot;.

==Synopsis==
According to Reggio, the film has no screenplay per se, but three movements (like those of a symphony) with different themes:

# Numerica.com: Language and place gives way to numerical code and virtual reality.
# Circus maximus: Competition, winning, records, fame, “fair play” and the love of money are elevated to the prime values of life. Life becomes a game.
# Rocketship twentieth century: A world that language can no longer describe. The resulting explosive tempo of technology is war and civilized violence.

==Production==
The September 11 attacks against the World Trade Center took place very close to the film&#x27;s production studio, impacting the content of the film and further convincing the crew of the importance of its subject.

While &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; and &quot;Powaqqatsi&quot; examine modern life in industrial countries and the conflict between encroaching industrialization and traditional ways of life, using slow motion and time-lapse footage of cities and natural landscapes, about eighty percent of &quot;Naqoyqatsi&quot; uses archive footage and stock images manipulated and processed digitally on non-linear editing (non-sequential) workstations and intercut with specially-produced computer-generated imagery to demonstrate society&#x27;s transition from a natural environment to a technology-based one. Reggio described the process as &quot;virtual cinema&quot;.

==Music==

The music is more in the traditional orchestral tradition than much of Glass&#x27;s work as a familiar doorway to images so disconnected from the familiar world. One instrument, the cello played by Yo-Yo Ma, plays through much of the piece. Some non-orchestral instruments are used in addition to traditional ones, including a didgeridoo and an electronically-created jaw harp.

Soundtrack.net reviewer Glenn McClanan noted that unlike the previous two films, the music is more on the softer side.

==Release and reception==
The film was released on DVD by Miramax on October 14, 2003.

The Criterion Collection released this as part of the Qatsi trilogy on December 11, 2012.

Rotten Tomatoes reported that 48% out of 52 reviews were positive with the average score of 5.82/10, and the consensus saying that it is &quot;the weakest film in Reggio&#x27;s trilogy&quot;.

<text>WAPA-TV (channel 4) is a Spanish-language independent television station in San Juan, Puerto Rico, owned by WAPA Media Group. The station&#x27;s studios are located on Luis Vigoreaux Avenue in Guaynabo, and its transmitter is on the WKAQ-TV (channel 2) transmission tower at Cerro La Santa in Cayey near the Carite State Forest. WAPA-TV is the most watched television station in Puerto Rico.

The station&#x27;s signal is relayed across Puerto Rico through two full-power satellite stations: WTIN-TV (digital channel 14, virtual channel 4) in Ponce and [[WNJX-TV]] (digital channel 31, virtual channel 4) in Mayagüez. WTIN-TV also broadcasts two subchannels simulcast from WKAQ-TV, including its Telemundo programming, using virtual channels 2.11 and 2.21.

==History==
WAPA-TV began broadcasting on May 1, 1954, as the second television station to be licensed to Puerto Rico. Its callsign is a partial abbreviation of the station&#x27;s original owners, the now-defunct , or Puerto Rico Sugar Grower&#x27;s Association. During its earliest years, the station was affiliated with NBC, ABC, DuMont, and the CMQ Television Network.
The station was the first in the U.S. territory to transition to color unceremoniously in 1966, followed by WKAQ-TV in 1968. Popularly known in Puerto Rico by its assigned channel number, , the station was also known by its animated cartoon mascot during the 1970s and 1980s, a bongo-playing cat (known commonly as in Spanish) and therefore its slogan was (colloquially &quot;on four (legs) like the cat&quot;), which rhymes in its original Spanish. Similarly, another station promo used the phrase, and the cat itself was alternately known as .

Like other mascots, was seen in different situations in different on-air promos. Besides playing the bongos, he would also play the drums and was seen in one station ID as a matador. Another promo had him interacting with a cat seen in a Telemundo ad. El Gato would also sometimes be accompanied by his wife and children (one boy and one girl), where they appeared flying in a helicopter shaped like the channel&#x27;s &quot;4&quot; logo and celebrated the holidays while playing musical instruments.

WAPA-TV&#x27;s competitors include WKAQ-TV (Telemundo), WLII (Univision affiliate station Teleonce) and PBS member station WIPR-TV. WAPA-TV and WKAQ-TV have battled for the title of Puerto Rico&#x27;s most-watched television station since the 1950s, with WLII entering the battle in the mid-1980s.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, the station became very successful by mixing American shows translated to Spanish with locally produced sitcoms such as , , , and . However, it still trailed behind WKAQ-TV as the second most-watched Puerto Rican station. In the early 1990s, WAPA rebranded itself with the slogans (a catchy slang variation of , or &quot;Let&#x27;s go!&quot;) and (&quot;WAPA, here with the people&quot;). These slogans were accompanied by a catchy musical score and vivid, colorful graphics depicting the channel&#x27;s logo. In 1994, WAPA was the first television station in Puerto Rico to use high-end graphic animations to animate a new logo, created and animated by Pixel Light Studios of New York City. This gave the station a very &quot;American&quot; on-air appearance. The logo, although graphically pleasing, was slowly dropped in favor of the classical number 4 logo. High end graphics were later dropped altogether for cheaper, in-house graphics.

In 1997, under the helm of former Univision executive Miguel Banojian, WAPA-TV achieved its biggest increases in viewership ever. During Banojian&#x27;s tenure, the network produced more local programming than ever before, increasing its local news programming, and broadcasting several sporting events including &quot;Serie del Caribe&quot; (the Caribbean edition of the U.S. baseball World Series) and World Boxing Championship events produced in partnership (since the early 1980s) with Don King (WAPA would also sometimes broadcast fights promoted by King&#x27;s rival Bob Arum and other promoters like Bob Andreoli).

In 1998, WAPA again rebranded itself with a new name and logo; (a brand that was used previously during the 1970s and 1980s). It also regained its position as a major Puerto Rican television station, mainly due to its new focus on locally produced programming. Its new slogan, (&quot;Like you, Puerto Rican&quot;—a nod to the longtime colloquial nickname for Puerto Ricans) highlighted the fact that it was the only local commercial station remaining in Puerto Rico that was programmed locally. Despite the new name, local residents still referred to the station as either or simply &quot;WAPA&quot;. That same year, former WKAQ-TV general manager Joe Ramos was named president of WAPA-TV.

In September 2004, WAPA-TV became the first Puerto Rican station, and the seventh television station in the U.S. (including territories) to become a satellite-distributed superstation. WAPA America can be seen in the U.S. mainland through DirecTV and Dish Network, and on various cable television providers including Xfinity, Spectrum, Verizon FiOS and Optimum, but this is not the first time WAPA-TV has had any presence in the United States. In 1968, WAPA-TV had WNJU-TV (Channel 47) not only as its sister station but also as its affiliate, predating WAPA America by decades. WNJU-TV was owned by Screen Gems before selling it in 1984 to a consortium that would launch the NetSpan network, later evolving into Telemundo.

On October 19, 2006. LIN TV announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its Puerto Rico television operations to InterMedia Partners for $130 million in cash. The sale was completed on March 30, 2007.

On December 17, 2007, the station changed its branding from to , in all lowercase letters. Following the rebrand, the station began developing a new format, changing its jingle and redesigning their website. WAPA-TV signed an agreement with Miss Puerto Rico Universe to produce a reality show titled , which debuted on August 15, 2008, where the public is able to select which five of the participants move directly to the pageant&#x27;s semifinal via text messaging votes.

On January 23, 2013, InterMedia Partners announced that it would merge WAPA-TV and WAPA America, along with its stake in Cinelatino, with the shell corporation Azteca Acquisition Corporation (which is not associated with the Mexican-based Azteca group or the Azteca América network) to form Hemisphere Media Group. 73% of the new company is owned by InterMedia.

On December 1, 2017, WAPA-TV named Javier Maynulet Montilla as president and general manager, succeeding Ramos, who spent 20 years at the station until his retirement on April 27, 2018.

On November 9, 2020, WAPA-TV named Jorge Hidalgo as president and general manager of the station effective January 1, 2021, after Javier Maynulet left the station after two years. Hidalgo currently serves as a Senior Vice President of Operations for Hemisphere Media Group.

===Outages===
On December 3, 2015, WAPA-TV along with WIPR-TV went off-air, due to a transmitter outage at Cerro La Santa in Cayey. The station was still watchable on Liberty, Dish Network, DirecTV and Claro TV. The transmitter was repaired and placed back on air on December 10, 2015. Repairs were made by WAPA&#x27;s engineering department.

On September 20, 2017, the main transmission tower of WAPA-TV was destroyed during Hurricane Maria. This caused the station to be off-air for two days until they began transmitting through Univision-owned stations WSTE-DT (until October 30) and WLII-DT (until November 17; which was owned by Univision at the time) from their transmitter in Aguas Buenas. Since November 18, the station then began transmitting its main programming (virtual channel 4.1) through station WKAQ-TV and WAPA Deportes (4.2) through WIPR-TV.

On October 28, 2018, one year after going dark, WAPA-TV returned to the air from its new transmitter installed at the WKAQ-TV tower location, broadcasting with High Quality Doble Data HD. Repairs caused by the old transmitter equipment were made by the engineering department.

===DirecTV-WAPA carriage dispute===
On May 4, 2018, Hemisphere Media Group became involved in a retransmission consent dispute with DirecTV, resulting in WAPA-TV&#x27;s removal from DirecTV&#x27;s Puerto Rico channel lineup. The station was restored on June 14, 2018, after the two sides came to a new agreement.

===Dish-WAPA carriage dispute===
On October 24, 2019, at 7 p.m., Hemisphere Media Group became involved in a retransmission consent dispute with Dish Network, resulting in WAPA-TV&#x27;s removal from Dish&#x27;s Puerto Rico channel lineup. The station was restored on December 17, 2019, after the two sides came to a new agreement.

==Programming==
===&quot;NotiCentro&quot;===


 (a Spanish translation of NewsCenter) is the name of WAPA-TV&#x27;s news division; the station presently broadcasts 44 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with eight hours each weekday and two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The news operation began in 1967 with Cuban-born Evelio Otero as the sole anchorman for the 6 p.m. newscast. Soon after, Carlos Ruben Ortiz joined the news staff for the 6 p.m. broadcast. Otero remained alone on camera, until his departure from WAPA in 1980 to take the senior editor position at the Voice of America in Washington. Ortiz shared the anchor slot at 6 p.m. with then newcomer Guillermo José Torres, a former radio announcer born in Juana Diaz who has since become the longest standing news anchor on the island, with a career spanning 43 years (Torres retired on August 5, 2013). The format predated the &quot;NewsCenter&quot; format which became popular on NBC affiliates in the 1970s.

In its beginnings, ran for only fifteen minutes in the afternoon, with a half-hour edition at 10 p.m.; there was also a weekend edition. Eventually, the program&#x27;s running time was increased to a full hour. After Otero&#x27;s departure, New York City–born William &quot;Bill&quot; Pérez became WAPA&#x27;s news director (Torres held the post for a while, but eventually asked to serve only as a news anchor). In the late 1970s, Enrique Cruz, Luz Nereida Vélez, Sylvia Gómez, Luis Rigual, Cyd Marie Fleming, José Ésteves, Luis Francisco Ojeda and others joined the news department.

In 1980, inaugurated a new studio. In 1981, Pedro Rosa Nales joined the team. In 1982, Enrique Cruz, also known as &quot;Kike Cruz&quot;, replaced Torres as show director. In 1983, Rigual died, and was replaced as main sports anchor by Rafael Bracero. Bobby Angleró joined the team of reporters as Bracero&#x27;s main helper in 1983, the same year that the &quot;Coquí Satellite&quot; was inaugurated by the station. &quot;Coquí Satellite&quot; helped the station deliver breaking news quicker, and helped deliver the news on occasions such as the Challenger explosion, when Torres interrupted Ángela Meyer on her &quot;Chanita Gobernadora&quot; comedy section to break the news to the public only minutes after it had happened.

In the early 2000s, WAPA-TV began using a helicopter for newsgathering called (&quot;SuperChopper&quot;). The had mostly been used to report on traffic conditions in the metropolitan area on the 4 and 5 p.m. newscasts. WAPA-TV was the only local station to have a helicopter, but regular use of the &quot;SuperCóptero&quot; was soon discontinued due to budget cuts; WAPA now only uses the helicopter for special events such as elections and breaking news coverage.

 ran a local cable channel, WAPA Tiempo, which featured weather forecasts for Puerto Rico 24 hours a day. Originally named (its name changed to avoid confusion with The Weather Channel cable network), it could be seen on all three cable companies then serving Puerto Rico at the time (OneLink Communications, Choice Cable TV, and Liberty Puerto Rico; all of them now merged as the latter); it was also broadcast on WAPA-TV digital subchannel 4.3. WAPA Tiempo was discontinued on September 1, 2012, due to WAPA Deportes (subchannel 4.2) upgrading to Full HD resolution to broadcast MLB postseason games; the channel was also dropped from Liberty cable.

WAPA-TV uses the same logo for (formerly ), only changing the word WAPA to . The music package previously used for the newscast was &quot;News Authority&quot; by 615 Music and has been used since 2004. In the past, the station used &quot;WNDU 1986 News Theme&quot;, &quot;Turn to News&quot;, &quot;Newswatch 24&quot;, &quot;News One&quot; and &quot;Impact&quot; among others. now uses the same music for all its segments and bumpers except for its news résumé (&quot;In One Week&quot;), which used the &quot;NotiCentro 4&quot; graphics and music package from 1999 but now uses the current graphics and music package. Since 2012, WAPA-TV uses the &quot;Truth&quot; music package by 615 Music with &quot;Truth V1&quot; from 2012 to 2017, and &quot;Truth V2&quot; since 2017 for all newscasts.

On May 20, 2019, expanded to hours beginning at 4 p.m., renaming itself as , with Normando Valentín serving as an anchor for the early evening newscast. Valentín has been with the station since 2003, and was morning anchor from 2008 to 2019. On February 3, 2020, Katiria Soto returns to WAPA-TV after five years working at WXTV-DT in New York, this time as a co-anchor of the 4 p.m. newscast.

<text>The Flower Kings are a Swedish progressive rock band formed in 1994 by guitarist and singer-songwriter Roine Stolt. The group began as Stolt&#x27;s touring band to support his third solo album &quot;The Flower King&quot;. They continued performing after the tour and have gone on to become one of the most prolific studio recording units in progressive rock, having released over twenty hours of music spread across sixteen studio albums. Their music is similar to early symphonic progressive rock groups such as Yes, marked by sharp dynamic changes, polyrhythms, heavy bass, vocal harmonies, abstract lyrics, and extended song lengths.

==History==
===Formation===
In early 1993, guitarist and singer Roine Stolt had written material for his third solo album &quot;The Flower King&quot; and sought musicians to perform it. He had wanted to release a progressive rock-style album for a while and felt the time was right to pursue the project. The album features Stolt on vocals, guitar, bass and keyboards; Jaime Salazar on drums; and Hasse Fröberg on vocals. It was recorded in Sweden between May 1993 and January 1994.

In preparation for Stolt&#x27;s concert tour to support the album&#x27;s release, Stolt, Salazar, and Fröberg were joined by Stolt&#x27;s brother Michael on bass and Tomas Bodin on keyboards. The five performed their first gig on 20 August 1994 at an outdoor festival in Uppsala, Stolt&#x27;s hometown and the city where &quot;The Flower King&quot; was recorded. After they decided to become a full-time band, they officially adopted the name The Flower Kings, named after Stolt&#x27;s album. Stolt had produced a list of potential titles for the record, one of which was &quot;The Flower King&quot;, and chose it because of its positive meaning and its reference to the hippie era of the 1960s.

===Activity===
After performing a series of concerts through 1994, the band entered the studio in December 1994 to record their debut album, &quot;Back in the World of Adventures&quot;. The recording process was gradual, finishing in September 1995.

In 2000, Michael Stolt was replaced by Jonas Reingold. Two years later, Salazar was replaced by Zoltan Csörsz. Daniel Gildenlöw of Pain of Salvation joined the band the same year as a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist.

Other contributors have included Hasse Bruniusson (percussion) and Ulf Wallander (saxophone).

Stolt has written the vast majority of the material the band has recorded, with Bodin contributing most of the rest. The music is best described as symphonic progressive rock, bearing a strong resemblance to the music of Yes, King Crimson, Gentle Giant, and early Genesis, with jazz fusion and blues influences. The band&#x27;s lyrics are almost uniformly positive and uplifting, affirming such values as love, peace, and spirituality, and furthering their association with Yes.

Their 1999 album &quot;Flower Power&quot; contains the eighteen-section, almost 60-minute &quot;Garden of Dreams&quot;.

In June 2007, they released &quot;The Road Back Home&quot;, a compilation of remixed songs from 1994 to 2006, plus &quot;Little Deceiver&quot; (a previously unreleased track) and the full version of their cover of &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; by Genesis.

Zoltan Csörsz was replaced by new drummer Marcus Liliequist for one album, but returned for the 2007 album, &quot;The Sum of No Evil&quot;. He was subsequently replaced by Erik Hammarström in 2008.

In 2008, Ola Heden, previously of Reingold&#x27;s side project Karmakanic, joined on guitar, vocals and keyboards.

In November 2008, the band were the opening act at the Ecco Prog Fest in Moscow.

After touring in 2008, The Flower Kings were inactive for four years. Stolt felt the band had varied levels of focus in their direction and had started to feel lost. They reunited in 2011 to work on new material after Stolt felt it was the right time and sensed eagerness from the other members to work together. This marked the arrival of German drummer Felix Lehrmann. &quot;Banks of Eden&quot;, the group&#x27;s eleventh album, was released in June 2012 and was recorded with analogue recording techniques and styles reminiscent of the height of vinyl records. This was followed by &quot;Desolation Rose&quot; in October 2013.

The lineup of Stolt, Bodin, Reingold, Fröberg and Lehrmann played together for the last time in 2015. 2016 and 2017 saw the band members busy with other engagements.

In December 2017, the first part of a career-spanning box set titled &quot;A Kingdom of Colours&quot; was released. This first box, with 10 discs, covers the period from 1995 to 2002 and includes the studio albums from &quot;Back in the World of Adventures&quot; to &quot;Unfold the Future&quot;. The second box set, titled &quot;A Kingdom of Colours 2&quot; and covering the albums &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; through to &quot;Desolation Rose&quot;, was released in June 2018.

In September 2018, Stolt announced a new album named &quot;Manifesto of an Alchemist&quot;. The album did not feature long-time keyboardist Tomas Bodin, and as such, it is credited to &quot;Roine Stolt&#x27;s The Flower King&quot; rather than &quot;The Flower Kings&quot;.

In August of the same year, Roine Stolt presented a new band called &quot;Roine Stolt and friends play The Flower Kings&quot;. The band featured Stolt, Fröberg and Reingold with new keyboard player Zach Kamins and new drummer Mirko De Maio. Roine Stolt stated that he was done being in a group and wanted to tour as a solo artist like Roger Waters or Steven Wilson. Tomas Bodin was not a part of this group and made his displeasure quite public. The band toured with Spock&#x27;s Beard in November and December 2018 and continued to do shows in 2019, this time under the name &quot;The Flower Kings Revisited&quot;.

In July 2019, &quot;Revisited&quot; was removed from the band name, making it clear that this lineup was now &quot;The Flower Kings&quot;. The band went on to release the double albums &quot;Waiting for Miracles&quot; in 2019 and &quot;Islands&quot; in 2020, the latter having been recorded entirely remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 24 March 2021, Roine Stolt announced two big projects. The Flower Kings are working on a brand new album &quot;in the same innocence&quot; of &quot;Stardust We Are&quot;. By the end of 2021, Stolt explained that Jonas Reingold could no longer participate in the touring line-up due to his commitments with Steve Hackett&#x27;s band, but Reingold still plays some of the songs in the studio.

On January 7, 2022, the band announced their 15th studio album &quot;By Royal Decree&quot; would be released on 4 March 2022, while also announcing that founding member Michael Stolt returned after more than two decades to contribute bass and vocals, splitting duties with current bassist Jonas Reingold. On 8 April 2022, InsideOut and Roine Stolt announced that &quot;Back in the World of Adventures&quot; and &quot;Retropolis&quot; were getting &quot;remastered and partly remixed&quot;. The release date for both was placed on 27 May 2022. &quot;Stardust We Are&quot; and &quot;Flower Power&quot; were also remixed and remastered in June.

The 16th studio album, &quot;Look at You Now&quot;, was announced for an 8 September 2023 release, alongside a European tour about to take place in October 2023. In April 2023, Zach Kamins revealed he left the group due to complicating touring logistics and Daniel Lantz joined for the summer shows. In July, the group mentioned that Lalle Larsson will play for the rest of the upcoming European dates.

<doc id="101571" wikidata="Q453665" url="?curid=101571" title="Nella Larsen">
<text>Nellallitea &quot;Nella&quot; Larsen (born Nellie Walker; April 13, 1891 – March 30, 1964) was an American novelist. Working as a nurse and a librarian, she published two novels, &quot;Quicksand&quot; (1928) and &quot;Passing&quot; (1929), and a few short stories. Though her literary output was scant, she earned recognition by her contemporaries.

A revival of interest in her writing has occurred since the late 20th century, when issues of racial and sexual identity have been studied. Her works have been the subjects of numerous academic studies, and she is now widely lauded as &quot;not only the premier novelist of the Harlem Renaissance, but also an important figure in American modernism.&quot;

==Early life==
Nella Larsen was born Nellie Walker, in a poor district of south Chicago known as the Levee, on April 13, 1891 (though Larsen would frequently claim to have been born in 1893). Her mother was Pederline Marie Hansen, an ethnically Danish immigrant, probably born in 1868, possibly in Schleswig-Holstein. Migrating to the USA around 1886 and going by the name Mary, Larsen&#x27;s mother worked as a seamstress and domestic worker in Chicago. She died in 1951 in Santa Monica, Los Angeles County.

Larsen&#x27;s father was Peter Walker, believed to be a mixed-race Afro-Caribbean immigrant from the Danish West Indies. Walker and Hansen obtained a marriage license in 1890, but may never have married. Walker was probably a descendant on his paternal side of Henry or George Walker, white men from Albany, New York, who were known to have settled in the Danish West Indies in about 1840. In the Danish West Indies, the law did not recognise racial difference, and racial lines were more fluid than in the former slave states of the United States. Walker may never have identified as &quot;Negro.&quot; He soon disappeared from the lives of Nella and her mother; she said he had died when she was very young. At this time, Chicago was filled with immigrants, but the Great Migration of blacks from the South had not begun. Near the end of Walker&#x27;s childhood, the black population of the city was 1.3% in 1890 and 2% in 1910.

Marie then married Peter Larsen (aka Larson, b. 1867), a fellow Danish immigrant. In 1892 the couple had a daughter, Anna Elizabeth, also known as Lizzie (married name Gardner). Nellie took her stepfather&#x27;s surname, sometimes using versions spelled Nellye Larson and Nellie Larsen, before settling finally on Nella Larsen. The mixed family moved west to a mostly white neighborhood of German and Scandinavian immigrants, but encountered discrimination because of Nella. When Nella was eight years old, they moved a few blocks back east.

The American author and critic Darryl Pinckney wrote of her anomalous situation:
as a member of a white immigrant family, she [Larsen] had no entrée into the world of the blues or of the black church. If she could never be white like her mother and sister, neither could she ever be black in quite the same way that Langston Hughes and his characters were black. Hers was a netherworld, unrecognizable historically and too painful to dredge up.

From 1895 to 1898, Larsen lived in Denmark with her mother and her half-sister. While she was unusual in Denmark because of being of mixed race, she had some good memories from that time, including playing Danish children’s games, which she later wrote about in English. After returning to Chicago in 1898, she attended a large public school. At the same time as the migration of Southern blacks increased to the city, so had European immigration. Racial segregation and tensions had increased in the immigrant neighborhoods, where both groups competed for jobs and housing.

Her mother believed that education could give Larsen an opportunity and supported her in attending Fisk University, a historically black university in Nashville, Tennessee. A student there in 1907–08, for the first time Larsen was living within an African-American community, but she was still separated by her own background and life experiences from most of the students, who were primarily from the South, with most descended from former slaves. Biographer George B. Hutchinson established that Larsen was expelled, along with ten other women, inferring that this was for some violation of Fisk&#x27;s strict dress or conduct codes for women. Larsen went on her own to Denmark, where she lived for a total of three years, between 1909 and 1912, and attended the University of Copenhagen. After returning to the United States, she continued to struggle to find a place where she could belong.

==Nursing career==
In 1914, Larsen enrolled in the nursing school at New York City&#x27;s Lincoln Hospital and Nursing Home. The institution was founded in the 19th century in Manhattan as a nursing home to serve black people, but the hospital elements had grown in importance. The total operation had been relocated to a newly constructed campus in the South Bronx. At the time, the hospital patients were primarily white; the nursing home patients were primarily black; the doctors were white males; and the nurses and nursing students were black females. As Pinckney writes: &quot;No matter what situation Larsen found herself in, racial irony of one kind or another invariably wrapped itself around her.&quot;

Upon graduating in 1915, Larsen went South to work at the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama, where she soon became head nurse at its John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital and training school. While at Tuskegee, she was introduced to Booker T. Washington&#x27;s model of education and became disillusioned with it. As it was combined with poor working conditions for nurses at Tuskegee, Larsen decided to leave after a year or so.

She returned to New York in 1916, where she worked for two years as a nurse at Lincoln Hospital. After earning the second-highest score on a civil service exam, Larsen was hired by the city Bureau of Public Health as a nurse. She worked for them in the Bronx through the 1918 flu pandemic, in &quot;mostly white neighborhoods&quot; and with white colleagues. Afterwards she continued with the city as a nurse.

==Marriage and family==
In 1919, Larsen married Elmer Imes, a prominent physicist; he was the second African American to earn a PhD in physics. After her marriage, she sometimes used the name Nella Larsen Imes in her writing. A year after her marriage, she published her first short stories.

The couple moved to Harlem in the 1920s, where their marriage and life together had contradictions of class. As Pinckney writes:

By virtue of her marriage, she was a member of Harlem&#x27;s black professional class, many of them people of color with partially European ancestry. She and her husband knew the NAACP leadership: W.E.B. Du Bois, Walter White, James Weldon Johnson. However, because of her low birth and mixed parentage, and because she did not have a college degree, Larsen was alienated from the black middle class, whose members emphasized college and family ties, and black fraternities and sororities.

Her mixed racial ancestry was not itself unusual in the black middle class. But many of these individuals, such as Langston Hughes, had more distant European ancestors. He and others formed an elite of mixed race or people of color, some of whom had ancestors who had been free people of color well before the American Civil War. This had given many families an advantage in establishing themselves and gaining educations in the North. In the 1920s, most African Americans in Harlem were exploring and emphasizing their black heritage.

Imes&#x27;s scientific studies and achievement placed him in a different class than Larsen. The Imes couple had difficulties by the late 1920s, when he had an affair with a white woman at Fisk University, where he was a professor. Imes and Larsen would divorce in 1933.

==Librarian and literary career==

In 1921, Larsen worked nights and weekends as a volunteer with librarian Ernestine Rose, to help prepare for the first exhibit of &quot;Negro art&quot; at the New York Public Library (NYPL). Encouraged by Rose, she became the first black woman to graduate from the NYPL Library School. It was run by Columbia University and opened the way for integration of library staff.

Larsen passed her certification exam in 1923. She worked her first year as a librarian at the Seward Park Branch on the Lower East Side, which was predominantly Jewish. There she had strong support from her white supervisor Alice Keats O&#x27;Connor, as she had from Rose. They, and another branch supervisor where she worked, supported Larsen and helped integrate the staff of the branches. Larsen transferred to the Harlem branch, as she was interested in the cultural excitement in the African-American neighborhood, a destination for migrants from across the country.

In October 1925, Larsen took a sabbatical from her job for health reasons and began to write her first novel. In 1926, having made friends with important figures in the Negro Awakening (which became known as the Harlem Renaissance), Larsen gave up her work as a librarian.

She became a writer active in Harlem&#x27;s interracial literary and arts community, where she became friends with Carl Van Vechten, a white photographer and writer. In 1928, Larsen published &quot;Quicksand&quot;, a largely autobiographical novel. It received significant critical acclaim, if not great financial success.

In 1929, she published &quot;Passing&quot;, her second novel, which was also critically successful. It dealt with issues of two mixed-race African-American women who were childhood friends and had taken different paths of racial identification and marriage. One identified as black and married a black doctor; the other passed as white and married a white man, without revealing her African ancestry. The book explored their experiences of coming together again as adults.

In 1930, Larsen published &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, a short story for which she was accused of plagiarism. &quot;Sanctuary&quot; was said to resemble the British writer Sheila Kaye-Smith&#x27;s short story, &quot;Mrs. Adis&quot;, first published in the United Kingdom in 1919. Kaye-Smith wrote on rural themes, and was very popular in the US. Some critics thought the basic plot of &quot;Sanctuary,&quot; and some of the descriptions and dialogue, were virtually identical to Kaye-Smith&#x27;s work.

The scholar H. Pearce has disputed this assessment, writing that, compared to Kaye-Smith&#x27;s tale, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; is &quot;... longer, better written and more explicitly political, specifically around issues of race – rather than class as in &#x27;Mrs Adis&#x27;.&quot; Pearce thinks that Larsen reworked and updated the tale into a modern American black context. Pearce also notes that in Kaye-Smith&#x27;s 1956 book, &quot;All the Books of My Life&quot;, the author said she had based &quot;Mrs Adis&quot; on a 17th-century story by St Francis de Sales, Catholic bishop of Geneva. It is unknown whether she knew of the Larsen controversy in the United States. Larsen herself said the story came to her as &quot;almost folk-lore&quot;, recounted to her by a patient when she was a nurse.

No plagiarism charges were proved. Larsen received a Guggenheim Fellowship even in the aftermath of the controversy, worth roughly $2,500 at the time, and was the first African-American woman to do so. She used it to travel to Europe for several years, spending time in Mallorca and Paris, where she worked on a novel about a love triangle in which all the protagonists were white. She never published the book or any other works.

==Later life==

Larsen returned to New York in 1937, when her divorce had been completed. She was given a generous alimony in the divorce, which gave her the financial security she needed until Imes&#x27;s death in 1941. Struggling with depression, Larsen stopped writing. After her ex-husband&#x27;s death, Larsen returned to nursing and became an administrator. She disappeared from literary circles. She lived on the Lower East Side and did not venture to Harlem.

Many of her old acquaintances speculated that she, like some of the characters in her fiction, had crossed the color line to &quot;pass&quot; into the white community. Biographer George Hutchinson has demonstrated in his 2006 work that she remained in New York, working as a nurse.

Some literary scholars have engaged in speculation and interpretation of Larsen&#x27;s decision to return to nursing, viewing her decision to take time off from writing as &quot;an act of self-burial, or a &#x27;retreat&#x27; motivated by a lack of courage and dedication.&quot; What they overlooked is that during that time period, it was difficult for a woman of color to find a stable job that would also provide financial stability. For Larsen, nursing was a &quot;labor market that welcomed an African American as a domestic servant&quot;. Nursing had been something that came naturally to Larsen as it was &quot;one respectable option for support during the process of learning about the work.&quot; During her work as a nurse, Larsen was noticed by Adah Thoms, an African-American nurse who co-founded the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses. Thoms had seen potential in Larsen&#x27;s nursing career and helped strengthen Larsen&#x27;s skills. When Larsen graduated in 1915, it was Adah Thoms who had made arrangements for Larsen to work at Tuskegee Institute&#x27;s hospital.

Larsen draws from her medical background in &quot;Passing&quot; to create the character of Brian, a doctor and husband of the main character. Larsen describes Brian as being ambivalent about his work in the medical field. Brian&#x27;s character may also be partially modeled on Larsen&#x27;s husband Elmer Imes, a physicist. After Imes divorced Larsen, he was closely associated with Ethel Gilbert, Fisk Director of public relations and manager of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, although it is unclear if the two married.

Larsen died in her Brooklyn apartment in 1964, at the age of 72.

==Legacy ==
In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary for her. She was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame in 2022.

Nella Larsen was an acclaimed novelist, who wrote stories in the midst on the Harlem Renaissance. Larsen is most known for her two novels, &quot;Quicksand&quot; and &quot;Passing&quot;; these two pieces of work got much recognition with positive reviews. Many believed that Larsen was a rising star as an African American novelist, until she soon after left Harlem, her fame, and writing behind.

Larsen is often compared to other authors who also wrote about cultural and racial conflict such as Claude Mckay and Jean Toomer.

Nella Larsen&#x27;s works are viewed as strong pieces that well represent mixed-race individuals and the struggles with identity that some inevitably face.

There have been some arguments that Larsen’s work did not well represent the &quot;New Negro&quot; movement because of the main characters in her novels being confused and struggling with their race. However, others argue that her work was a raw and important representation of how life was for many people, especially women, during the Harlem Renaissance.

Larsen&#x27;s novel &quot;Passing&quot; was adapted as a 2021 film of the same name by Rebecca Hall.

===1928: &quot;Quicksand&quot;===

Helga Crane is a fictional character loosely based on Larsen&#x27;s experiences in her early life. Crane is the lovely and refined mixed-race daughter of a Danish white mother and a West Indian black father. Her father died soon after she was born. Unable to feel comfortable with her maternal European-American relatives, Crane lives in various places in the United States and visits Denmark, searching for people among whom she feels at home. As writer Amina Gautier points out, &quot;in a mere 135 pages, Larsen details five different geographical spaces and each space Helga Crane moves to or through alludes to a different stage in her emotional and psychological growth.&quot;

Nella Larsen&#x27;s early life is similar to Helga&#x27;s in that she was distant from the African-American community, including her African-American family members. Larsen and Helga did not have father figures. Both of their mothers decided to marry a white man with the hope of having a higher social status. Larsen wanted to learn more about her background so she continued to go to school during the Harlem Renaissance. Even though Larsen&#x27;s early life parallels Helga&#x27;s, in adulthood, their life choices end up being very different. Nella Larsen pursued a career in nursing while Helga married a preacher and stayed in a very unhappy marriage.

In her travels, she encounters many of the communities that Larsen knew. For example, Crane teaches at Naxos, a Southern Negro boarding school (based on Tuskegee University), where she becomes dissatisfied with its philosophy. She criticizes a sermon by a white preacher, who advocates the segregation of blacks into separate schools and says their striving for social equality would lead blacks to become avaricious. Crane quits teaching and moves to Chicago. Her white maternal uncle, now married to a bigoted woman, shuns her. Crane moves to Harlem, New York, where she finds a refined but often hypocritical black middle class obsessed with the &quot;race problem.&quot;

Taking her uncle&#x27;s legacy, Crane visits her maternal aunt in Copenhagen. There she is treated as an attractive racial exotic. Missing black people, she returns to New York City. Close to a mental breakdown, Crane happens onto a store-front revival and has a charismatic religious experience. After marrying the preacher who converted her, she moves with him to the rural Deep South. There she is disillusioned by the people&#x27;s adherence to religion. In each of her moves, Crane fails to find fulfillment. She is looking for more than how to integrate her mixed ancestry. She expresses complex feelings about what she and her friends consider genetic differences between races.

The novel develops Crane&#x27;s search for a marriage partner. As it opens, she has become engaged to marry a prominent Southern Negro man, whom she does not really love, but with whom she can gain social benefits. In Denmark she turns down the proposal of a famous white Danish artist for similar reasons, for lack of feeling. By the final chapters, Crane has married a black Southern preacher. The novel&#x27;s close is deeply pessimistic. Crane had hoped to find sexual fulfillment in marriage and some success in helping the poor Southern blacks she lives among, but instead she has frequent pregnancies and suffering. Disillusioned with religion, her husband, and her life, Crane fantasizes about leaving her husband, but never does. &quot;She sinks into a slough of disillusionment and indifference. She tries to fight her way back to her own world, but she is too weak, and circumstances are too strong.&quot;

The critics were impressed with the novel. They appreciated her more indirect take on important topics such as race, class, sexuality, and other issues important to the African-American community rather than the explicit or obvious take of other Harlem Renaissance writers. For example, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer found it &quot;an articulate, sympathetic first novel&quot; which demonstrated an understanding that &quot;a novelist&#x27;s business is primarily with individuals and not with classes.&quot; The novel also won Larsen a bronze prize (second place) for literature in 1928 from the William E. Harmon Foundation.

===1929: &quot;Passing&quot;===
 Larsen&#x27;s novel &quot;Passing&quot;  begins with Irene receiving a mysterious letter from her childhood friend Clare, following their encounter at the Drayton Hotel, after twelve years with no communication. Irene and Clare lost contact with each other after the death of Clare&#x27;s father Bob Kendry, when Clare was sent to live with her white aunts. Both Irene and Clare are of mixed African-European ancestry, with features that enable them to pass racially as white if they choose. Clare chose to pass into white society and married John Bellew, a white man who is a racist. Unlike Clare, Irene passes as white only on occasion for convenience, in order be served in a segregated restaurant, for example. Irene identifies as a black woman and married an African-American doctor named Brian; together they have two sons. After Irene and Clare reconnect, they become fascinated with the differences in their lives. One day Irene meets with Clare and Gertrude, another of their childhood African-American friends; during that meeting Mr. Bellew meets Irene and Gertrude. Bellew greets his wife with a racist pet name, although he doesn&#x27;t know that she is partially black.

Irene becomes furious that Clare did not tell her husband about her full ancestry. Irene believes Clare has put herself in a dangerous situation by lying to a person who hates blacks. After meeting Clare&#x27;s husband, Irene does not want anything more to do with Clare but still keeps in touch with her. Clare begins to join Irene and Brian for their events in Harlem, New York while her husband is traveling out of town. Because Irene has some jealousy of Clare, she begins to suspect her friend is having an affair with her husband Brian. The novel ends with John Bellew learning that Clare is of mixed race. At a party in Harlem, she falls out of a window from a high floor of a multi-story building, to her death, in ambiguous circumstances. Larsen ends the novel without revealing if Clare committed suicide, if Irene or her husband pushed her, or if it was an accident.

The novel was well received by the few critics who reviewed it. Writer and scholar W. E. B. Du Bois hailed it as &quot;one of the finest novels of the year.&quot;

Some later critics described the novel as an example of the genre of the tragic mulatto, a common figure in early African-American literature after the American Civil War. In such works, it is usually a woman of mixed race who is portrayed as tragic, as she has difficulty marrying and finding a place to fit into society. Others suggest that this novel complicates that plot by playing with the duality of the figures of Irene and Clare, who are of similar mixed-race background but have taken different paths in life. The novel also suggests attraction between them and erotic undertones in the two women&#x27;s relationship. Irene&#x27;s husband is also portrayed as potentially bisexual, as if the characters are passing in their sexual as well as social identities. Some read the novel as one of repression. Others argue that through its attention to the way &quot;passing&quot; unhinges ideas of race, class, and gender, the novel opens spaces for the creation of new, self-generated identities.

Since the late 20th century, &quot;Passing&quot; has received renewed attention from scholars because of its close examination of racial and sexual ambiguities and liminal spaces. It has achieved canonical status in many American universities.

<text>Boards of Canada are a Scottish electronic music duo consisting of the brothers Mike Sandison and Marcus Eoin, formed initially as a trio in 1986 before becoming a duo in the 1990s. Signing first to Skam followed by Warp Records in the 1990s, the duo received recognition following the release of their debut album &quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot; on Warp in 1998. They followed with the acclaimed albums &quot;Geogaddi&quot; (2002), &quot;The Campfire Headphase&quot; (2005) and &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Harvest&quot; (2013).

The duo&#x27;s work, largely influenced by media and electronic music from the 1970s, incorporates vintage synthesiser tones, samples, analog equipment, and hip hop-inspired beats. It has been described by critics as exploring themes related to nostalgia, as well as childhood memory, science, environmental concerns and esoteric subjects. In 2012, &quot;Fact&quot; described them as &quot;one of the best-known and best-loved electronic acts of the last two decades&quot;.

==History==
===Early years (1986–1994)===
The brothers Mike Sandison (born Michael Peter Sandison, 14 July 1971) and Marcus Eoin (born Marcus Eoin Sandison, 27 May 1973) were brought up in Cullen, Moray, on the northeast coast of Scotland. From 1979 to 1980, they lived in Calgary, Canada, while their father, who worked in construction, took part in the project to build the Saddledome. They attended the University of Edinburgh, where Michael studied music and Marcus studied artificial intelligence. Marcus dropped out before completing his degree. The duo did not reveal that they are brothers until a 2005 interview with &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, as they had wanted to avoid comparisons with another electronic sibling duo, Orbital.

Growing up in a musical family, the brothers first played instruments at a young age. They experimented with recording techniques from around the age of 10, using tape machines to layer cut-up samples of found sounds over compositions of their own. In their teens they participated in a number of amateur bands. However, it was not until 1986 when Marcus was invited to join Mike&#x27;s band that Boards of Canada was born. The band&#x27;s name was inspired by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), the government agency whose award-winning documentary films and animation they had watched as children.

The duo self-financed the limited release of the Twoism EP in 1995. After a copy was sent to Sean Booth of Autechre, Booth suggested contacting Skam Records, leading to the release of Hi Scores in 1996 on the label.

Their first known release was &quot;Catalog 3&quot;, in 1987 on cassette tape, on the brothers&#x27; own label, Music70, while Boards of Canada was still a band (it was later re-pressed in 1997 on CD on the same label). By 1989, the band had been reduced to Mike and Marcus, and they released Acid Memories in the same year. Both albums have only been heard by the band&#x27;s friends and family, except for a 24-second excerpt of &quot;Duffy&quot;, released on the EHX website in the late 1990s. Acid Memories is the only early album the brothers have mentioned in interviews. Later, in the early 1990s, the band had a number of collaborations and the band put on small shows among the Hexagon Sun collective, along with the releases of albums &quot;Play By Numbers&quot; and &quot;Hooper Bay&quot;, both in 1994, which, similarly to Acid Memories, were only released to friends and family and had sub-1 minute excerpts of two songs (&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t You Like To Be Free&quot; from &quot;Play By Numbers&quot; and &quot;Circle&quot; from &quot;Hooper Bay&quot;) released from both albums on the EHX website.

===&quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot; (1995–2002)===
Between 1995 and 1997, the duo started recording what would become their debut studio album, &quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot;, which was finally released in April 1998. The album was joint-released by both Skam Records and Warp Records. The cover of the album is a family photo that was taken at Banff Springs, with each person&#x27;s face digitally removed. The album consists of longer tracks mixed with song vignettes. It also includes one of the duo&#x27;s most popular songs, &quot;Roygbiv&quot;. &quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot; received widespread acclaim upon release, with it being featured at No. 35 on Pitchfork&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1990s&quot; list.

===&quot;Geogaddi&quot; and &quot;The Campfire Headphase&quot; (2002–2009)===
The duo began recording their next studio album, &quot;Geogaddi&quot;, between 1999 and 2001. It was described by Sandison as &quot;a record for some sort of trial-by-fire, a claustrophobic, twisting journey that takes you into some pretty dark experiences before you reach the open air again.&quot; &quot;Geogaddi&quot; was officially released by Vivid on 8 January 2002 in Japan, and by Warp Records on 18 February 2002 in Europe. Critics noted a shift in mood within &quot;Geogaddi&quot;; Mark Richardson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; commented that &quot;the atmosphere on this album is a shade darker than on previous releases, and comparatively tense with a noticeable thread of paranoia.&quot; It was later noted by the duo that the album was a response to the September 11 attacks.

As early as 2002, the duo began working on sketches for their next studio album, &quot;The Campfire Headphase&quot;, however studio work didn&#x27;t begin until 2004. After releasing two singles from the album exclusively onto Bleep, and a music video for the track &quot;Dayvan Cowboy&quot;, &quot;The Campfire Headphase&quot; was released on 17 October 2005. When writing about the album for &quot;The Observer&quot;, Simon Reynolds noted that &quot;blurring the boundaries between rock and techno is a smart move, because BoC have always made music that deserved to appeal beyond the electronic audience&quot;, and praised &quot;the stereophonic delirium of their production.&quot;

===&quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Harvest&quot; (2013)===
After the release of their previous studio album and an EP named &quot;Trans Canada Highway&quot;, Eoin and Sandison &quot;took some time out, and spent some time travelling&quot;. The two also expanded their recording studio at Hexagon Sun, which is near the Pentland Hills in Scotland. In February 2012, a BBC Radio personality noted that a new album from Boards of Canada was &quot;on the way&quot;.

On Record Store Day 2013, a vinyl record containing a short clip of music and a distorted voice speaking a six digit code, which was believed to be the work of Boards of Canada, surfaced at the New York record store Other Music. Shortly after the release, Warp Records vouched for the record&#x27;s authenticity.

Other codes were hidden through various websites and online communities, as well as being broadcast over BBC Radio One, NPR, and Adult Swim. After much speculation, the official website for the band redirected users to another website which prompted the user to enter a password. Once all six unique codes were entered, a video was shown announcing &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Harvest&quot;, their fourth studio album. The website showed the cover art, the month and year of release and a short snippet of music. The album was released on 5 June 2013 in Japan, 10 June 2013 in Europe, and 11 June 2013 in the United States to widespread critical acclaim.

===Remixes and &quot;WXAXRXP&quot; (2016–2021)===
In 2016, Boards of Canada released two remixes. The first, a remix of Nevermen&#x27;s &quot;Mr Mistake&quot;, was released on 12 January 2016, and was followed shortly after by a remix of &quot;Sisters&quot; by Odd Nosdam on 22 February 2016. On 17 February 2017, an instrumental version of the &quot;Mr Mistake&quot; remix was released. On 29 July 2017, Boards of Canada released a remix of &quot;Sometimes&quot; by The Sexual Objects.

In 2019, Warp Records kicked off the celebrations for their 30th anniversary, entitled WXAXRXP, with a 100-hour takeover of online radio station NTS Radio, featuring mixes, radio shows and unreleased music from a number of artists on their roster. This included a 2-hour mixtape from Boards of Canada titled &quot;Societas X Tape&quot;, aired on 23 June 2019 at 9:00 PM BST, and featured music from other artists such as Grace Jones, Devo and Yellow Magic Orchestra, spliced with spoken word samples and music that is rumoured to be unreleased work from the group itself. On July 3, 2021, Boards of Canada released a remix of a second Nevermen song, &quot;Treat Em Right&quot;.

==Style and methods==
The music of Boards of Canada has been described as &quot;evocative, mournful, sample-laden downtempo music often sounding as though produced on malfunctioning equipment excavated from the ruins of an early-&#x27;70s computer lab.&quot; Critic Simon Reynolds described their style as &quot;a hazy sound of smeared synth-tones and analog-decayed production, carried by patient, sleepwalking beats, and aching with nostalgia&quot; while crediting them with &quot;reinvent[ing]&quot; elements of psychedelia through the deliberate misuse of technology. Their distinctive style is a product of their use of analogue equipment, mix of electronic and conventional instrumentation, use of distorted samples, and their layering and blending of these elements. To achieve their evocative and &quot;worn down&quot; sound, the duo have made use of outdated brands of recording equipment, such as tape machines manufactured by Grundig. They also make use of samples from 1970s television shows and other media prevalent in the era of the brothers&#x27; shared childhood, especially the nature-inspired documentaries produced by the National Film Board of Canada. The duo&#x27;s preoccupation with memory, past aesthetics, and public broadcasting presaged the 2000s electronic movement known as hauntology. Theorist and music critic Adam Harper described their work as &quot;a simultaneously Arcadian and sinister musical hauntology based on cut-up samples, vintage synthesiser technology and a faded modernism arising from mid-twentieth-century television, science, public education, childhood and spirituality.&quot;

Interviews with the Sandison brothers have variously provided insight into their creative process: they have cited several acts that have influenced their work including Joni Mitchell, the Incredible String Band (saying &quot;we have all the String Band records […] our rural sensibilities are similar&quot;), the Beatles (saying &quot;[they] really became enthralling to us through their psychedelism&quot;) and My Bloody Valentine (saying &quot;even if we don&#x27;t sound like them, there&#x27;s a connection in terms of the approach to music&quot;). They have also named Meat Beat Manifesto as a chief influence, citing their synth sounds.

Brief interludes or vignettes feature prominently in the duo&#x27;s music, often lasting less than two minutes; Sandison has said that &quot;we write far more of [these] than the so-called &#x27;full-on&#x27; tracks, and, in a way, they are our own favourites&quot;. Boards of Canada have written an enormous number of such fragments as well as full-length tracks, most of which have been held back from release, and it does not appear that their music is made exclusively for commercial release; rather, albums seem to be the result of selecting complementary songs from current work. For instance, &quot;Geogaddi&quot; allegedly involved the creation of 400 song fragments and 64 complete songs, of which 22 were selected (possibly 23, if the final track of complete silence is included). Eoin has said about the duo&#x27;s discography that &quot;the idea of the perfect album is this amorphous thing that we&#x27;re always aiming at […] the whole point of making music is at least to aim at your own idea of perfection.&quot;

The duo have expressed interest in themes of subliminal messaging, and subsequently their work has incorporated cryptic messages, including references to numerology and cult figures such as David Koresh of the Branch Davidians. When questioned about their aims in making such references, Boards of Canada have expressed themselves in neutral terms (saying &quot;We&#x27;re not religious at all [...] and if we&#x27;re spiritual at all it&#x27;s purely in the sense of caring about art and inspiring people with ideas.&quot;) while remaining fascinated with the ability of music to influence the minds of others (saying, with irony, that &quot;[We] do actually believe that there are powers in music that are almost supernatural. I think you actually manipulate people with music...&quot;).

<doc id="101583" wikidata="Q6537" url="?curid=101583" title="Vicenza">
<text>Vicenza ( ; ; ) is a city in northeastern Italy. It is in the Veneto region, at the northern base of the Monte Berico, where it straddles the River Bacchiglione. Vicenza is approximately west of Venice and east of Milan.

Vicenza is a thriving and cosmopolitan city, with a rich history and culture, and many museums, art galleries, piazzas, villas, churches and elegant Renaissance &quot;palazzi&quot;. With the Palladian villas of the Veneto in the surrounding area, and his renowned Teatro Olimpico (&quot;Olympic Theater&quot;), the &quot;city of Palladio&quot; has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1994.

Vicenza had an estimated population of 115,927 and a metropolitan area of 270,000 in 2008. Vicenza is the third-largest Italian industrial centre as measured by the value of its exports, and is one of the country&#x27;s wealthiest cities, in large part due to its textile and steel industries, which employ tens of thousands of people. Additionally, about one fifth of the country&#x27;s gold and jewelry is made in Vicenza, greatly contributing to the city&#x27;s economy. Another important sector is the engineering/computer components industry (Federico Faggin, the microprocessor&#x27;s co-inventor, was born in Vicenza).

== History ==

=== Roman era ===
Vicentia was settled by the Italic Euganei tribe and then by the Paleo-Veneti tribe in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. The Romans allied themselves with the Paleo-Veneti in their fight against the Celtic tribes that populated north-western Italy.
 The Roman presence in the area grew exponentially over time and the Paleo-Veneti (whose culture mirrored Etruscan and Greek values more so than Celtic ones) were gradually assimilated. In 157 BC, the city was a de facto Roman centre and was given the name of Vicetia or Vincentia, meaning &quot;victorious&quot;.

The citizens of Vicetia received Roman citizenship and were inscribed into the Roman tribe &quot;Romilia&quot; in 49 BC. The city was known for its agriculture, brickworks, marble quarry, and wool industry and had some importance as a way-station on the important road from &quot;Mediolanum&quot; (Milan) to Aquileia, near &quot;Tergeste&quot; (Trieste), but it was overshadowed by its neighbor &quot;Patavium&quot; (Padua). Little survives of the Roman city, but three of the bridges across the Bacchiglione and Retrone rivers are of Roman origin, and isolated arches of a Roman aqueduct exist outside the &quot;Porta Santa Croce&quot;.

During the decline of the Western Roman Empire, Heruls, Vandals, Alaric and his Visigoths, as well as the Huns laid waste to the area, but the city recovered after the Ostrogoth conquest in 489 AD, before being conquered by the Byzantine Empire soon after. It was also an important Lombard city and then a Frankish center. Numerous Benedictine monasteries were built in the Vicenza area, beginning in the 6th century.

=== Middle Ages ===
In 899, Vicenza was destroyed by Magyar raiders.

In 1001, Otto III handed over the government of the city to the bishop, and its communal organization had an opportunity to develop, separating soon from the episcopal authority. It took an active part in the League with Verona and, most of all, in the Lombard League (1164–1167) against Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa compelling Padua and Treviso to join: its , Ezzelino II il Balbo, was captain of the league. When peace was restored, however, the old rivalry with Padua, Bassano, and other cities was renewed, besides which there were the internal factions of the Vivaresi (Ghibellines) and the Maltraversi (Guelphs).

The tyrannical Ezzelino III from Bassano drove the Guelphs out of Vicenza, and caused his brother, Alberico, to be elected podestà in 1230. The independent commune joined the Second Lombard League against Emperor Frederick II who sacked the city in 1237, after which it was annexed to Ezzelino&#x27;s dominions. On his death the old oligarchic republic political structure was restored – a &quot;consiglio maggiore&quot; (&quot;grand council&quot;) of four hundred members and a &quot;consiglio minore&quot; (&quot;small council&quot;) of forty members – and it formed a league with Padua, Treviso and Verona. Three years later the Vicentines entrusted the protection of the city to Padua, so as to safeguard republican liberty; but this protectorate (&quot;custodia&quot;) quickly became dominion, and for that reason Vicenza in 1311 submitted to the Scaligeri lords of Verona, who fortified it against the Visconti of Milan.

Vicenza came under the rule of the Republic of Venice in 1404, and its subsequent history is that of Venice. It was besieged by the Emperor Sigismund. In 1496, the &quot;podestà&quot; Antonio Bernardo expelled the Jews from Vicenza. Maximilian I held possession of Vicenza in 1509 and 1516.

=== Early modern era ===
Vicenza was a candidate to host the Council of Trent.

The 16th century was the time of Andrea Palladio, who left many outstanding examples of his art with palaces and villas in the city&#x27;s territory, which before Palladio&#x27;s passage, was arguably the most downtrodden and esthetically lacking city in Veneto.

After the Fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797, under Napoleonic rule, it was made a duché grand-fief (not a grand duchy, but a hereditary (extinguished in 1896), nominal duchy, a rare honor reserved for French officials) within Napoleon&#x27;s personal Kingdom of Italy for general Caulaincourt, also imperial Grand-Écuyer. One of the consequences of the city&#x27;s occupation was the destruction of a prized silver model of the city, the Jewel of Vicenza.

=== 19th century and later ===
After 1814, Vicenza passed to the Austrian Empire. In 1848, however, the populace rose against Austria, more violently than in any other Italian centre apart from Milan and Brescia (the city would receive the highest award for military valour for the courage displayed by revolutionaries in this period). As a part of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, it was annexed to Italy after the Third War of Italian independence.

Vicenza&#x27;s area was a location of major combat in both World War I (on the Asiago plateau) and World War II (a focal center of the Italian resistance), and it was the most damaged city in Veneto by Allied bombings, including many of its monuments; the civil victims were over 2,000. The end of World War II was followed by a period of depression, caused by the devastation during the two world wars. In the 1960s, the whole central part of Veneto, witnessed a strong economic development caused by the emergence of small and medium family businesses, ranging in a vast array of products (that often emerged illegally) that paved the way for what would be known as the &quot;miracolo del nord-est&quot; (&quot;miracle of the northeast&quot;).
In the following years, the economic development grew vertiginously. Huge industrial areas sprouted around the city, massive and disorganized urbanization and employment of foreign immigrants increased.

Vicenza is home to the US Army post Caserma Ederle (Camp Ederle), also known as the U.S. Army Garrison Vicenza. In 1965, Caserma Ederle became the headquarters of the Southern European Task Force, which includes the 173d Airborne Brigade. In January 2006, the European Gendarmerie Force was inaugurated in Vicenza.

== Geography ==

Vicenza lies in the Veneto region, at the northern base of Monte Berico, where it straddles the Bacchiglione River. Vicenza is approximately west of Venice and east of Milan.

== Demographics ==
In 2007, there were 114,268 people residing in Vicenza of whom 47.6% were male and 52.4% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.17% of the population, compared to pensioners, who number 21.60%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of Vicenza residents is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Vicenza grew by 3.72%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85%. The current birth rate of Vicenza is 9.16 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.
In 2010, 83.5% of the population was Italian. From 1876 to 1976 it has been calculated that over 1,000,000 people from the province of Vicenza have emigrated, with more than 3,000,000 people of Vicentino descent living around the world (most common migrational currents included Brazil, the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Belgium and Switzerland) escaping the devastation left by poverty, war and sickness. Today, almost 100,000 Vicenza citizens live and work abroad and the city has morphed from a land of emigration to a land of immigration. The largest immigrant group comes from the United States (about 9,000 people, partly due to the presence of the military base). Other ethnic minorities comes from other European nations (the largest being Serbia, Romania, and Moldova), South Asian (the largest being Bangladesh and Pakistan), sub-saharan Africa, and North Africa (largest is from Morocco). The city is predominantly Roman Catholic, but due to immigration, it now has some Orthodox Christian, Muslim and Sikh followers.

In 1994 UNESCO inscribed &quot;Vicenza, City of Palladio&quot; on its list of World Heritage Sites. In 1996, the site was expanded to include the Palladian villas outside the core area, and accordingly renamed &quot;City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto&quot;.

=== Palladio&#x27;s works ===
Vicenza is home to twenty-three buildings designed by Palladio. Famous examples include:

* Basilica Palladiana, centrally located in Vicenza&#x27;s &quot;Piazza dei Signori&quot;, of which Palladio himself said that &quot;it might stand comparison with any similar work of antiquity&quot;
* Teatro Olimpico, designed for the &quot;Accademia Olimpica&quot; (Olympic Academy) and begun to be built in 1580, when Palladio died. The wooden scenes are by Vincenzo Scamozzi.
* Villa Almerico Capra (also known as &quot;La Rotonda&quot;), located just outside the downtown area
* Palazzo Chiericati, home of the city pinacotheca
* Palazzo Barbaran da Porto, home of the &quot;Museo Palladio&quot;
* Palazzo del Capitaniato, home of the city council
* Palazzo Porto
* Palazzo Porto in Piazza Castello (incomplete)
* Palazzo Thiene Bonin Longare (built by Vincenzo Scamozzi)
* Palazzo Thiene
* Villa Gazzotti Grimani, in the &quot;frazione&quot; Bertesina

==== Churches ====

Some of the main historical churches:
* Cathedral of Vicenza (church of Santa Maria Annunciata), dating from early in the 11th century, and restored in the 13th, 16th, 19th and after the ruinous destruction of World War II, possesses a number of paintings and sculptures, nearly all of them by Vicentine artists; the dome and north side door were designed by Andrea Palladio.
* Basilica Sanctuary of Saint Mary of Monte Berico: the structure was completed in two stages, creating two churches in different styles: the first in 1428 in Gothic style, the second in 1703 by Carlo Borella, designed as a late-baroque style basilica. The adjacent convent, houses &quot;The Supper of Saint Gregory the Great&quot;, a large canvas by Paolo Veronese. The bell tower (1826) was designed by Antonio Piovene. The basilica commemorates two apparitions of Our Lady to Vincenza Pasini, a pious woman who lived in a village in the province, and the liberation of the city from a terrible plague.
* Basilica of Santi Felice and Fortunato: church built in the 4th century within a Roman cemetery and expanded in the 5th century to house the relics of the martyrs Felice and Fortunato. In the 9th century, the city, and the church, were razed by the Hungarians; by the 10th century, the church had been re-erected by the bishop Rodolfo with the support of Emperor Otto II. It has the layout of a paleochristian basilica, initially rectangular, then doubled in width and divided into three naves. After the Hungarian invasions, the Benedictines built a new baptistery and the semicircular apse, adding the bell tower and the rosette, as well as a series of blind arches and a Byzantine cross in front. In later centuries, the interiors underwent a radical alteration, enriching it with Baroque altars and decorations. A 20th century restoration removed many of these embellishments. Next to the church there is a small museum exhibition with archaeological finds from the church and from the nearby Roman necropolis.
* Santa Corona: one of the oldest and most important churches of the city, this 13th century church first endowed by the bishop of Verona, the Blessed Bartholomew of Breganze, to shelter one of the thorns from Christ&#x27;s crown. It was under the purview of the Dominicans after the death of Ezzelino III da Romano. It houses paintings by Montagna (&quot;The Magdelene&quot;), Bellini (&quot;Baptism of Christ&quot;) and others; the crypt hosts the Valmarana chapel by Palladio. The church underwent a major restoration in 2012.
* San Giorgio in Gogna: one of the oldest churches in the city, built before the year 1000 with a Romanesque façade. The outer walls consist of agglomerates of different materials (brick, stone, marble salvaged from other buildings) are clearly a demonstration of the origin of the construction craft, which can be seen especially in the polygonal apse. It was restored by the diocese in 2011.
* San Lorenzo (1280): church built by minorites in mixed Gothic and Lombard Romanesque styles. Located along Corso Fogazzaro facing the central Piazza San Lorenzo, it hosts the tombs of illustrious Vicentines and is served by the Conventual Franciscans.
* Santa Maria Nova: late 16th-century church is the only religious architecture designed and built by Palladio in Vicenza, apart from the Valmarana chapel and the limited interventions in the cathedral.
* Santa Maria in Araceli (1244): church later refurbished by Guarini in Baroque style, formerly belonged to the Clarisses, contains statues by Orazio Marinali and Cassetti, and the reproductions of original altarpieces by Piazzetta and Tiepolo (now at the Pinacotheca Civica).
* Santa Maria of the Servites (Vicenza)|Santa Maria of the Servites: church in Piazza Biade adjacent to the Piazza dei Signori, was commissioned in the early 15th century by the order of the Servants of Mary. The church portal was executed in the studio where Andrea Palladio worked at the beginning of his career and would be one of his earliest works. In the cloister, in 1319, the miracles of St. Philip Benizi de Damiani took place.
* Santa Maria Etiopissa (1154): a simple stone and brick structure church.
* San Marco in San Girolamo (early 18th century): late baroque church built by the Discalced Carmelites on a previous convent and church of the Jesuati. The architect is unknown, but inside it is clear the influence of the style of the Venetian Giorgio Massari. After the Napoleonic abolition of the religious orders and their convents, it became in 1810 the church of San Marco, one of the oldest parishes in the city. It hosts many works by Vicentine and Venetian artists of the early 18th century, including some masterpieces. The sacristy preserves the complete original furniture of the time.
* San Vincenzo: church dedicated to Saint Vincent of Saragossa – ancient patron of Vicenza – overlooks Piazza dei Signori, facing the Basilica Palladiana, interrupting the smooth texture of the Palazzo del Monte di Pietà. The church was built between the 14th and the 18th centuries. The baroque façade (1614–1617) hosts two lodges with three arches, in Corinthian and composite style. The lodges are surmounted by a crown with Christ mourned by angels by Giambattista Albamese, also author of the five statues in the pediment. Behind the lodge there is the ancient church of 1387, offset in relation to the building that has incorporated, with the altar facing east. The interior of the church, as amended in 1499 and again in the 18th century by Francesco Muttoni, was restored in the 1920s. It hosts the ark of Simone Sarego (14th century), the impressive altar, rococo work of Bernardo Tabacco, and the altar of Pietà, masterpiece of a young Orazio Marinali (1689). Within the porch, a red marble stele is engraved with the ancient official linear measures of the Community of Vicenza.
* Sant&#x27;Agostino: church built upon older buildings in the 14th century, the ancient convent of Saint Augustine is located on the western outskirts of the city, giving its name to the parish and to the &quot;frazione&quot;. The abbey church was rebuilt in Romanesque style during the rule of Cangrande della Scala between 1322 and 1357. The church has a rich decoration and a large altarpiece of 1404 by Battista da Vicenza.
* Oratory of San Nicola da Tolentino: finished in 1678 on commission of the fraternity of St. Nicholas, it is a chapel that houses a series of paintings focused on the life of the saint, among the highest levels of the measured Baroque of Vicenza.
* The Churches of the Carmini (1372) and St. Catherine (1292), formerly belonging to the Humiliati, possess notable pictures.
* Santa Croce (1179)
* Santi Filippo and Giacomo (12th century)

==== Secular buildings ====
* The Torre Bissara (clock tower) (1174), at 82 meters high, is one of the tallest buildings.
* The Biblioteca Civica Bertoliana, a public library founded by Count Giovanni M. Bertolo and opened in 1708
* Casa Pigafetta (1440), house of Antonio Pigafetta
* The Pinacotheca Civica houses mainly Vicentine paintings in the Palladian Palazzo Chiericati.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
The surrounding country is predominantly agricultural. Major products are wine, wheat, corn, olive oil (in the Barbarano area) and cherries and asparagus are a particularity of Bassano. There are also quarries of marble, sulphur, copper, and silver mines, and beds of lignite and kaolin; mineral springs also abound, the most famous being those of Recoaro.

Massive industrial areas surround the city and extend extensively in the western and eastern hinterland, with numerous steel and textile factories located in the Montecchio Maggiore, Chiampo and Sovizzo area in the west and Camisano Vicentino and Torri di Quartesolo in the east, areas characterised by a disorganised and extensive cementifaction.

Elite sectors are the jewelry and clothing factories. Important vicentino clothing firms include: Diesel, Pal Zileri, Marzotto, Bottega Veneta, Marlboro Classics etc. The Gold Exposition is world-famous and it takes place in Vicenza twice a year (January and September).

Other industries worthy of mention are the woollen and silk, pottery, tanneries, and musical instruments. The headquarters of the bicycle component manufacturer Campagnolo and the protective wear for sports manufacturer Dainese are located here.

== Transport ==
Vicenza railway station, opened in 1846, forms part of the Milan–Venice railway, and is also a junction of two branch lines, to Schio and Treviso.

== Sport ==
Vicenza is home to Vicenza Hurricanes American Football team which currently plays in League 2. Founded in 2009, the Hurricanes have a junior team and a senior team with a roster of 35+ athletes.

Vicenza is home to football club L.R. Vicenza Virtus, formerly Lanerossi Vicenza and Vicenza Calcio, which currently compete in Serie C. Their home venue is the Stadio Romeo Menti.

Vicenza is home to Rangers Rugby Vicenza, a rugby union team who compete in Serie A Elite.

== Cuisine and popular dishes ==
Vicenza&#x27;s cuisine reflects its humble, agricultural past: simple, hearty meals made with fresh local ingredients that reflect the province&#x27;s geographical diversity.

Unlike Venetian cuisine where fish reigns supreme, game meat, cheeses and vegetables take center stage accompanied by polenta, soft from the stove or day-old sliced and grilled over the fireplace embers, better yet cooked in a pan under the spit where it lightly fries in meat drippings to create a crunchy golden outer crust.

Vicenza is known for its simple dishes, and often famous cheeses, fruits, ingredients and wines, such as sopressa vicentina, Asiago cheese, Marostica cherries, Nanto truffles, Bassano del Grappa asparagus and Breganze Cabernet wine.

* &quot;Baccalà alla vicentina&quot;
* &quot;Risi e bisi&quot; (rice and green peas)
* &quot;Polenta e Osei&quot;
* &quot;Bigoli all&#x27;arna&quot; (thick fresh egg noodles with duck ragout)
* &quot;Putana&quot; (in this case not the vulgar term meaning &quot;whore&quot;, but a fruit cake traditionally made with poor ingredients such as old bread or polenta and dried fruit such as raisins)

The inhabitants of Vicenza are jokingly referred to by other Italians as &quot;mangiagatti&quot;, or &quot;cat eaters&quot;. Purportedly, Vicentini turned to cats for sustenance during times of famine, such as during World War II.

<text>EL AL Israel Airlines Ltd. (), trading as EL AL (, &quot;Upwards&quot;, &quot;To the Skies&quot;, or &quot;Skywards&quot;, stylized as ELAL; ) is the flag carrier of Israel. Since its inaugural flight from Geneva to Tel Aviv in September 1948, the airline has grown to serve almost 50 destinations, operating scheduled domestic and international services and cargo flights within Israel, and to Europe, the Middle East, the Americas, Africa, and the Far East, from its main base in Ben Gurion Airport.

El Al is the only commercial airline to equip its planes with missile defense systems to protect its planes against surface-to-air missiles, and is considered one of the world&#x27;s most secure airlines, thanks to its stringent security procedures, both on the ground and on board its aircraft. Although it has been the target of many attempted hijackings and terror attacks, only one El Al flight has ever been hijacked; that incident did not result in any fatalities.

As Israel&#x27;s national airline, El Al has played an important role in humanitarian rescue efforts, airlifting Jews from other countries to Israel, setting the world record for the most passengers on a commercial aircraft (single plane record of 1,088 passengers on a 747) by Operation Solomon when 14,500 Jewish refugees were transported from Ethiopia in 1991.

El Al offers only kosher in-flight meals, and does not fly passengers on the Jewish Shabbat or religious holidays.

In 2012, El Al operated an all-Boeing fleet of 42 aircraft, flying over 4 million passengers, and employed a staff of 6,056 globally. The company&#x27;s revenues for 2016 were $2.04 billion, with losses of $81 million, compared to a profit of $57 million in 2010. In 2018, the company&#x27;s revenue was $7.7 billion, with a net loss of $187.55 million. In July 2020, having lost hundreds of millions of dollars due to grounded flights and lay-offs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel and abroad, the company reached a bailout deal with the government, and Eli Rozenberg, who purchased a controlling stake (42.85%) in September of that year, with the government purchasing any unwanted shares (15%). 

==History==

===1948–1949: Foundation ===

In September 1948, Israel&#x27;s first president, Chaim Weizmann, attended a conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Weizmann was scheduled to fly back to Israel in an Israeli government aircraft, but due to an embargo imposed on Israel at the time, this was not possible. An Israeli C-54 military transport aircraft was instead converted into a civilian plane to transport Weizmann home. The aircraft was painted with the logo of the &quot;El Al/Israel National Aviation Company&quot; and fitted with extra fuel tanks to enable a non-stop flight from Geneva to Israel. It departed from Ekron Air Base on 28 September and returned to Israel the next day. After the flight, the aircraft was repainted and returned to military use.

The Airline was incorporated and became Israel&#x27;s national flag carrier on 15 November 1948, although it used leased aircraft until February 1949, when two unpressurized DC-4s were purchased from American Airlines. The acquisition was funded by the government of Israel, the Jewish Agency, and other Jewish organizations. The first plane arrived at Lod Airport (later renamed Ben Gurion) on 3 April 1949. Aryeh Pincus, a lawyer from South Africa, was elected head of the company. The first international flight, from Tel Aviv to Paris, with refueling in Rome, took place on 31 July 1949. By the end of 1949, the airline had flown passengers to London and Johannesburg. A state-run domestic airline, Israel Inland Airlines, was founded in 1949 in which El Al had a 50% stake.

From its earliest days, the operation of the airline in keeping with Jewish tradition has been a source of friction; when the Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion was forming his first coalition, the religious parties would not join unless Ben-Gurion promised that El Al would serve only kosher food on its flights and would not fly on the Jewish Sabbath. El Al owes its name to David Remez, the first Minister of Transport, who based the name on a passage from the book of Hosea. (Hosea 11:7)

=== 1950s: Adding cargo service and destinations ===
A regular service to London was inaugurated in the middle of 1950. Later that year, El Al acquired Universal Airways, which was owned by South African Zionists.

El Al&#x27;s cargo service was inaugurated in 1950 and initially relied on military surplus Curtiss C-46 Commando aircraft. The same aircraft type was used also for passengers transportation in certain routes. The same year the airline initiated charter services to the United States, followed by scheduled flights soon after.

In 1950–1951 El Al expanded its activities in Europe and added new destinations such as Vienna and Istanbul, Athens and Nicosia. On 31 July 1950, the company celebrated the first anniversary of its regular flight program.


The airline was involved in several covert operations: In the early 1950s, El Al airlifted over 160,000 immigrants to Israel from Iran, Iraq and Yemen as part of Operation Magic Carpet and Operation Ezra and Nehemiah. In 1960, Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann was captured and flown from Argentina to Israel on an El Al aircraft.

In 1955, after using Lockheed Constellations for several years, the airline purchased two Bristol Britannia aircraft. El Al was the second airline in the world to fly this plane, after the British Overseas Airways Corporation. In 1958, El Al ran a newspaper advertisement in the United States featuring a picture of a &quot;shrunken&quot; Atlantic Ocean (&quot;Starting Dec. 23, the Atlantic Ocean will be 20% smaller&quot;) to promote its non-stop transatlantic flights. This was a bold step: the airline industry had never used images of the ocean in its advertising because of the widespread public fear of airline crashes. The advertisement, which ran only once, proved effective. Within a year, El Al&#x27;s sales tripled.

=== 1960s: Turning profitable ===
Despite the purchase of its Britannia and the inauguration of non-stop transatlantic flights, the airline remained unprofitable. When Efraim Ben-Arzi took over the company in the late 1950s, the Britannias were replaced in the next decade by the Boeing 707 and Boeing 720 jet airliners.

The first year that El Al turned a profit was 1960. That year, more than 50 percent of the passengers flying into Israel arrived on El Al flights. On 15 June 1961, the airline set a world record for the longest non-stop commercial flight: an El Al Boeing 707 flew from New York to Tel Aviv, covering in 9 hours and 33 minutes. By this time, El Al was carrying 56,000 passengers a year—on a par with Qantas and ahead of established airlines like Loftleiðir. In 1961, El Al ranked 35th in the world in accumulated passenger distance. El Al&#x27;s success continued into the late 1960s. In 1968, regular flights to Bucharest were inaugurated, and cargo flights began to Europe and the United States. The airline also established a catering subsidiary, Teshet Tourism, and Aviation Services Ltd. All these ventures brought in a profit of $2 million that year.

==== Hijacking attempts ====
In 1968, El Al experienced the first of many acts of terrorism that have been perpetrated against the airline. On 23 July, the only successful hijacking of an El Al aircraft took place, when a Boeing 707 carrying 10 crew and 38 passengers were taken over by three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The aircraft, El Al Flight 426, which was en route from Rome to Tel Aviv, was diverted to Algiers by the hijackers. Negotiations with the hijackers lasted for 40 days. Both the hijackers and the passengers, including 21 Israeli hostages, were eventually freed. On 26 December of the same year, two PFLP members attacked an El Al aircraft at Athens International Airport, killing an Israeli mechanic. The Israeli Defense Forces responded to the incident on 29 December, with a night-time raid on Lebanon&#x27;s Beirut Airport, destroying 14 planes on the ground belonging to Middle East Airlines, Trans Mediterranean Airways and Lebanese International Airways. The military action was responsible for the demise of the LIA, which had most of its fleet destroyed.

On 18 February 1969, Palestinians attacked an El Al plane at Zurich Airport, killing the copilot and injuring the pilot. One Palestinian attacker was killed and others were convicted but later released. Between September and December of that year, bomb and grenade attacks occurred at El Al offices in Athens, West Berlin, and Brussels. This wave of violence culminated in the failed hijacking of an El Al 707 by Patrick Arguello and Leila Khaled on 6 September 1970, as part of the Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings.
=== 1970s: Going Boeing ===

El Al acquired its first Boeing 747 jet in 1971. Many felt it was a risky purchase given the high cost of the plane and fear of attacks, but El Al operations flourished after the purchase. Another Boeing 747 was delivered in 1973 and was used to start non-stop service from Tel Aviv to New York (El Al – Boeing 707s had flown eastward nonstop since around 1961).

El Al passengers and passengers from other airlines were attacked at Lod Airport in 1972, it was known as the Lod Airport massacre.

In the mid-1970s El Al began to schedule flights from airports outside of Israel that departed on the Jewish shabbat and landed in Israel after it had finished. However, the religious parties in the government were outraged by this change believing that it was a violation of Jewish law and contrary to the agreement signed in the early days of the state, in which El Al promised to refrain from flying on the Sabbath. In 1982 the newly re-elected prime minister Menachem Begin, brought before the Knesset a vote to ban Sabbath flights once again (it passed by a vote of 58 to 54). Outraged, the secular community threatened to boycott the airline. In August 1982 El Al workers blocked Orthodox and Hasidic Jews from entering the airport.

In 1977 El Al established a charter subsidiary, El Al Charter Services Ltd., later renamed Sun D&#x27;Or International Airlines Ltd. Two years earlier the airline had suffered its first losses since the late 1950s, largely a product of the global recession. The management changed three times towards the end of the 1970s until Itzhak Shander was named president. As the political situation in Iran deteriorated, El Al began to airlift Jews to Israel. All the airline&#x27;s infrastructure in Iran was eventually destroyed.

=== 1980s: From receivership to profitability ===
El Al flights to Cairo were inaugurated in April 1980, following the Egypt–Israel peace treaty. In late 1982, after a long period of labor disputes and strikes, El Al operations were suspended. The government appointed Amram Blum to run the company, which lost $123.3 million in the fiscal year ending April 1983. The airline also sold its stake in Arkia at this time.

Operations resumed in January 1983 under receivership. The government purchased two new Boeing 737 aircraft and announced plans to acquire four Boeing 767 jets at the cost of $200 million. Within four years, El Al was profitable again. It broke another record since then surpassed, in May 1988 with a non-stop flight from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv, a journey of in 13 hours and 41 minutes.

Flights to Poland and Yugoslavia were started in 1989.

=== 1990s: End of receivership, Ethiopian Jews airlifted ===
In January 1990, North American Airlines began providing feeder services to El Al&#x27;s US destinations. El Al held a 24.9 percent stake in the airline until selling it back to Dan McKinnon in July 2003. By this time, El Al was operating a fleet of 20 aircraft, including nine Boeing 747s, and had begun replacing its aging Boeing 707s with the Boeing 757. Early that year, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, El Al inaugurated regular flights to Moscow. No airlifts from the former Soviet Union were possible at the time but permission was granted in 1991. Charter flights commenced in August 1991, with immigrants also occupying all available seats on El Al&#x27;s scheduled routes. In cooperation with Aeroflot, El Al flew more than 400,000 Jewish immigrants to Israel within a three-year period.

On 24 May 1991, an El Al Boeing 747 cargo plane airlifted a record-breaking 1,088 Ethiopian Jews from Addis Ababa to Israel in the framework of Operation Solomon. Two babies were born during the flight. The plane carried twice as many passengers as it was designed for. In less than 36 hours, 14,500 Ethiopian Jews were flown to Israel. On 27 April 1994, El Al received its first Boeing 747-400.

El Al flights were inaugurated to the Far East and, in 1995, El Al signed its first codesharing agreement with American Airlines. In February 1995, the receivership under which the airline had technically been operating since 1982 came to an end. In June 1996, El Al recorded its first flight from Israel to Amman, Jordan.

In 1996, El Al recorded US$83.1 million in losses, due to the resumption of terrorist activities and the government&#x27;s open skies policy. To keep its planes flying during this period, El Al introduced flights &quot;to nowhere&quot;: passengers were offered various kinds of in-flight entertainment as the plane circled the Mediterranean. One-day shopping trips to London and visits to religious sites in eastern Europe were also promoted. In 1997, El Al opened a separate cargo division.

=== 21st century ===
El Al&#x27;s first Boeing 777 embarked on its maiden flight in March 2000. Later that year the controversy over flights on Shabbat erupted again, when the airline announced that it was losing US$55 million a year by grounding its planes on Saturdays. After privatization of the company began in June 2003, the policy regarding Shabbat flights was expected to change.

The first phase of the long-delayed privatization of the company commenced in June 2003 and by Israel&#x27;s Government Companies Authority, headed by Eyal Gabbai. 15 percent of El Al&#x27;s shares were listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. By June 2004, 50% of the company had been sold to the public. By January 2005, a controlling share of the company had been transferred to Knafaim-Arkia Holdings Ltd. As of October 2014, El Al&#x27;s major shareholders were Knafaim Holdings (36%), Ginsburg Group (10%) and Delek Group (10%).

In August 2010, El Al and JetBlue signed an agreement to provide connecting through tickets between Israel and 61 destinations in the United States from October 2010, via John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.

In 2015, El Al introduced a requirement that female flight attendants wear high heels until passengers had been seated. The airline&#x27;s workers&#x27; union stated that the requirement would endanger the health and safety of the flight attendants and instructed its members to ignore the rule. Later that year the requirement was removed.

In August 2017, El Al made their inaugural flight of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Their first variant of the plane was the 787-9, but in late 2019, they took delivery of the 787-8. The inaugural service was from Tel Aviv to London and Paris, with the transatlantic inaugural flight from Tel Aviv to Newark. El Al introduced a Premium Economy to this aircraft, in a 2-3-2 configuration. They also launched an upgraded Business Class with “pods” in a 1-2-1 configuration. This was upgraded from the original 2-3-2 configuration of their Business Class on the 777-200. Their Economy Class now also featured large personal touch screen entertainment and WiFi. In Business Class, the seats go to a 90° flat bed, have personal service, large touchscreen personal entertainment screens, and storage.

In April 2018 the Israel Postal Company issued a stamp with different El Al-planes commemorating the 70th anniversary of the airline.

In July 2019, El Al retired its sole freight aircraft, a Boeing 747-400F, ending its dedicated cargo flights. The airline plans to use charter services by other airlines for this purpose from now on.

In March 2020, El Al suspended operations due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Israeli government had announced that all foreign and Israeli passport holders would have to undergo a 14-day quarantine upon arrival into the country. El Al also converted some of their Boeing 787 Dreamliner airplanes to serve as cargo flights to transport medical goods from China to Europe through Tel Aviv&#x27;s Ben Gurion Airport. El Al also offered some passenger flights to get stranded Israeli citizens home. These flights went from Tel Aviv to Miami, New York, London, Paris, and more. They also offered two services to Australia during the pandemic. This was the first ever nonstop flight from Israel to Australia. El Al offered one flight from Tel Aviv to Perth and Tel Aviv to Melbourne.

On 1 July 2020, after returning substantial amounts of leased aircraft (and canceling current leases) the airline canceled all flights and suspended operations indefinitely. On 6 July, the company announced it had worked out a bailout deal with the government to make up the hundreds of millions of dollars it had lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel and abroad. The proposed deal would net the airline $250 million in government loans (with a guarantee for 75 percent of the loan in case of defaults) and an additional $150 million from its own sale of company shares which, if not sold, would be purchased by the government. The deal was approved by a Knesset committee. On 17 September, it was announced that Kanfei Nesharim, a company owned by 27-year-old Eli Rozenberg (son of US Centers Health Care nursing home chain founder Kenny Rozenberg), had bought a controlling 42.85% stake in the airline with a $107 million offer. Under the prior negotiated bailout deal, the Israeli government, which had committed to buying any unwanted shares as part of a rescue package, bought $34 million worth of shares, for a stake that equals roughly 15% of the company. The holdings of El Al&#x27;s owners before the bailout, Knafaim Holdings, fell to 15.2% from 38%. The new management will seek to emphasize &quot;punctuality&quot; and work to upgrade food services across all classes.

On 17 April 2022, El-Al started its first direct flight between the Israeli coastal city of Tel Aviv and Egypt&#x27;s Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Flight 5193 is operated by El-Al subsidiary Sun d’Or.

In October 2023, following the need for the urgent return of reserve soldiers due to the start of the Israel–Hamas war, El Al gained halachic approval from the Chief Rabbinate of Israel to break a 40-year policy of not flying on Shabbat, with the last time it flew on a Sabbath being in 1982 during the First Lebanon War. They also flew on the Sabbath following the attacks on Israeli football supporters in November 2024.

==Company affairs and identity==

===Headquarters===
El Al&#x27;s headquarters are located on the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport in Central District, Israel, near Lod. In 2022, El Al announced it would be moving its U.S. headquarters from New York to Miami.

===Operations===
During 2005, the airline transported 3.5 million passengers, a rise from 3.2 million in 2004 and 2.8 million in 2003. 60% of the airline&#x27;s passengers are Israeli.
In 2006, El Al posted a $44.6 million loss on revenues of $1.665 billion. The company is facing four lawsuits, two of which have been approved as class actions, which could cost the company $176.2 million. El Al spends $100 million a year to conform with airline security measures required by Israel&#x27;s Shin Bet security service. In early 2007, El Al opened a new King David Lounge at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. New lounges at Heathrow Airport in London and JFK International Airport in New York had also opened in late 2007.

In 2007, El Al invested NIS 1 billion in the purchase of two new Boeing 777-200s that included an updated El Al decal. The aircraft are fitted with upgraded seats with adjustable headrests and legrests. Each seat is equipped with a touch-screen entertainment system. The first aircraft, named &quot;Sderot&quot;, completed its maiden flight from New York to Tel Aviv on 26 July 2007. The second, &quot;Kiryat Shmona&quot;, was delivered at the end of August 2007.

After the United States Federal Aviation Administration downgraded Israel&#x27;s aviation safety rating to 2 in February 2009, an IATA member warned El Al, as well as competing airlines Arkia and Israir, that they may appear on the European blacklist of banned carriers. Giora Romm, head of the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel, responded to the claim, stating: &quot;We are in close contact with the Europeans.&quot; He added: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what the fuss is about. The Europeans&#x27; e-mail is strange. We are doing everything we can to improve security.&quot; The European Union has yet to make an official statement on the matter. El Al uses the Amadeus CRS system for reservation, inventory, check-in and online bookings. In November 2012, the United States FAA restored Israel&#x27;s category 1 rating.

El Al has a cargo branch, El Al Cargo, which became independent in 1997. As the national cargo airline of Israel, it operates between Tel Aviv, Liège, and New York, plus ad hoc worldwide charters with one Boeing 747-200F aircraft. Before 2001, when the Israeli air cargo market opened up to competition, El Al Cargo enjoyed a monopoly. Now, its main competition comes from Challenge Airlines IL.

As of December 2022 the company employs a staff of 4,610 globally, and has a fleet of 47 aircraft. The company&#x27;s revenues for 2023 were $2.503 billion, totaling profits of $263.7 million, compared to losses of $80.7 million in 2016 and a profit of $57 million in 2010. El Al has offices in 46 countries, half of them in Europe.

El Al has Hebrew language voiceovers and Arabic language subtitles in its flight safety videos, which is followed by another video in English. In 2017, the safety video was presented by mentalist Lior Suchard.

During the period of Shabbat, El Al observes Jewish religious traditions by refraining from flight operations and occasionally diverting flights or refraining from takeoff if the scheduled arrival would occur on a Saturday. Exceptions to this practice are exceptionally rare, having only occurred twice in the airline&#x27;s history: first during the First Lebanon War and later during the 2023 Israel-Hamas war, when flights operated on Shabbat due to exceptional circumstances.

=== Business trends ===

The key trends for El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. are shown below (as at year ending 31 December):

==Subsidiaries==

===Borenstein Caterers===
The main business of Borenstein, a company fully owned by El Al, registered in the U.S. and operating at New York&#x27;s JFK airport, is the production and supply of kosher ready meals to airlines and other institutions.

===Katit===
Katit (a company fully owned by El Al) is mainly engaged in the production and supply of meals to the company&#x27;s employees.

===Sun d&#x27;Or===

The charter operations of the group is carried out through Sun d&#x27;Or, a company fully owned by El Al. Sun d&#x27;Or operates as a tourist organizer for wholesalers and individuals and markets charter and scheduled flights, both by means of leasing full aircraft capacity to third parties, or aircraft parts&#x27; capacity to a number of partners for pre-negotiated prices, or by direct sales. Starting from 2011, Sun D&#x27;Or operates as a tourist organizer, while maintaining the &quot;Sun d&#x27;Or&quot; brand for scheduled and charter flights marketed by Sun d&#x27;Or. In March 2011, The Israel Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) announced the suspension of Sun d&#x27;Or&#x27;s operating license effective 1 April 2011. The CAA based its decision citing non-compliance with Israeli and international airline management standards, mainly lack of self-owned planes and crew. Since then, Sun d&#x27;Or no longer operates own aircraft but utilizes planes from its parent, El Al.

===Superstar Holidays===
Superstar (a company fully owned by El Al) is a tourist wholesaler that markets tourist package deals to travel agents and passengers, and sells airline tickets at discounted prices for flights on the company&#x27;s routes.

===Tamam===
Tamam (a company fully owned by El Al) is mainly engaged in the production and supply of kosher ready meals to airline companies.

===Former===
====Up====

On 26 November 2013, El Al unveiled its now-defunct low cost airline &quot;Up&quot;, which commenced operations on 30 March 2014, initially to Berlin, Budapest, Kyiv, Larnaca and Prague using five Boeing 737-800s transferred from the El Al fleet. Up was founded by its parent El Al to be used on some routes to Europe where it replaced El Al itself. All Up flights were operated by El Al, using El Al&#x27;s call sign and codes with a four digit number. For flights over two hours the airline offered a buy on board service.

In August 2014, Ryanair CEO Michael O&#x27;Leary foreshadowed the development of a Ryanair Israel, connecting Israel with cities across Europe. He said an inhibiting factor in the plan was Israeli authorities&#x27; protectiveness of El Al from competition. The CEO of Up wished to recreate the airline business world. Ryanair started serving Ovda Airport and Ben Gurion Airport in the winter season 2017/18 from several airports throughout Europe.

Up ceased operations on 14 October 2018. All of its six destinations and fleet were reintegrated into mainline El Al operations.

==Security==
Israel&#x27;s airport security measures were instituted in 1968 after the El Al Flight 426 hijacking by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. It was the first aviation attack motivated by political aims.

El Al employs stringent security procedures, both on the ground and onboard its aircraft. These time-consuming procedures have won El Al&#x27;s security reputation. In 2008, it was named by &quot;Global Traveler&quot; magazine as the world&#x27;s most secure airline.

===Onboard missile defense systems===
Certain El Al planes have been fitted with counter-measures against anti-aircraft missiles since the early 2000s, with the initial system known as Flight Guard. In 2014, El Al began to fit some of its planes that fly on more sensitive routes with an updated missile approach warning system (MAWS) that employs an infrared missile-tracking camera, an &quot;infrared (IR), ultra-violet (UV), or radar missile-approach warning sensor to detect a missile launch in the very early stages of an attack&quot; and a laser system to act as a counter-measure. In November 2014, under the Israeli government&#x27;s SkyShield programme, Elbit&#x27;s Commercial Multi-Spectral Infrared Countermeasures (C-MUSIC) system was adopted by El Al.

===Airport security measures===
There are four layers of airport security procedures in Israel: early detection outside the airport zone, airport access control, passenger and baggage screening, and on-board security. In the first layer, El Al Staff screen passenger lists before passengers&#x27; arrival at the airport.

At Israel&#x27;s Ben Gurion Airport, plainclothes and uniformed agents monitor the premises for explosives, suspicious behavior, and other threats. Armed security personnel also patrol El Al terminals overseas. Inside the terminal, passengers and their baggage are checked by a trained team. El Al security procedures require that all passengers be interviewed individually prior to boarding, allowing El Al staff to identify possible security threats. Passengers are asked questions about their place of origin, the reason for their trip, their job or occupation, and whether they have packed their bags themselves.

Passengers have to show up at the airport three hours before their flight, to be checked at a barrier on the road to the terminal. Arabs, including Israeli Arab citizens, are checked more stringently than any other ethnic group. At the check-in counter, passengers&#x27; passports and tickets are closely examined. A passport without a sticker from the security checkers will not be accepted. At passport control, passengers&#x27; names are checked against information from the FBI, Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Scotland Yard, Shin Bet, and Interpol databases. Luggage is screened and sometimes hand searched. In addition, bags are put through a decompression chamber simulating pressures during flight that could trigger explosives. Even at overseas airports, El Al security agents conduct all luggage searches personally, even if they are supervised by government or private security firms.

===Flight security measures===
Undercover agents (sometimes referred to as sky marshals) carrying concealed firearms sit among the passengers on every international El Al flight. Most El Al pilots are former Israeli Air Force pilots. The cockpits in all El Al aircraft have double doors to prevent entry by unauthorized persons. A code is required to access the doors, and the second door will open only after the first has closed and the person has been identified by the captain or first officer. Furthermore, there are reinforced steel floors separating the passenger cabin from the baggage hold.

In April 2013, the Israeli government increased payments to El Al to secure 97.5% of the airline&#x27;s security costs ahead of the Open Skies agreement to take effect in 2014 with the European Union.

== Controversies ==

===Security controversy and passenger profiling===

The airline was criticized by Hungarian courts for refusing to search luggage with the passenger present, acting against Hungarian domestic laws stipulating that only authorized officials are able to undertake such searches.

In 2008, a civil case was brought to the Supreme Court of Israel by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, which alleged that El Al&#x27;s practice of ethnic profiling illegally singled out Arab passengers for tougher treatment. The group had petitioned &quot;for the complete elimination of racial profiling&quot; by the airline. In 2015, the court dismissed the petition on procedural grounds, accepting in part the government&#x27;s argument &quot;that it could not completely change without heavily burdening all travelers,&quot; but reimbursing the Association for Civil Rights in Israel a total of NIS 30,000 for its legal fees, and finding that the petition &quot;had already gotten security to be less discriminatory.&quot; The court left the door open for a renewed petition in the future if required.

===Treatment of female passengers===
In September 2014, it was reported that there have been repeated incidents where some ultra-Orthodox male passengers refused to sit next to female passengers, sometimes delaying flights. As a result, a petition was initiated with Change.org to pressure El Al to alter their policy of allowing ultra-Orthodox passengers on flights to negotiate switching seats. The petition reads: &quot;Why does El Al Airlines permit female passengers to be bullied, harassed, and intimidated into switching seats which they rightfully paid for and were assigned to by El Al Airlines? One person&#x27;s religious rights do not trump another person&#x27;s civil rights.&quot;

Following the incidents, Iris Richman, founder of Jewish Voices Together, a group created to address issues of religious pluralism in Israel and the U.S., encouraged passengers to protest this behavior through the US government, referencing &quot;49 U.S. Code § 40127 – Prohibitions on discrimination: Persons in Air Transportation&quot;. According to this directive, she wrote, &quot;An air carrier or foreign air carrier may not subject a person in air transportation to discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, or ancestry.&quot; Richman contacted the U.S. Department of Transportation, Aviation Consumer Protection Division, and stated the department &quot;is willing to investigate any situation where any employee of a carrier – i. e., a steward/ess – participated in asking someone to change a seat because of their gender&quot;.

In November 2014, Tova Ross, in &quot;The Forward&quot;, disagreed that this is discrimination against women. She wrote, &quot;... If we [women] want the right to pray and practice and dress in the ways we see fit, why do we cast such caustic aspersions on the premise of a man who calmly asks to change his seat in order for him not to stray from his preferred religious outlook?&quot; ... &quot;A favor for a fellow human being, no matter how archaic we may deem his beliefs. We are indulging a request that we may neither understand nor agree with, but if it doesn&#x27;t really put us out, if the flight isn&#x27;t full, and there is in fact someone who will easily volunteer to switch seats, then what is everyone&#x27;s colossal problem with the mere premise?&quot;

El Al said that it would not put a policy in place to handle situations where male Haredim refuse to sit next to female passengers, but would instead attempt to satisfy passengers involved in such incidents on a case-by-case basis.

In February 2016, Renee Rabinowitz filed a successful lawsuit against El Al, after being involved in an incident where an ultra-Orthodox man refused to sit next to her on a flight from Newark International Airport to Tel Aviv and the flight attendants asked her to move seats. Later in 2018, the airline decided to immediately remove any passengers who refuse to sit next to a woman.

== Destinations ==

El Al serves destinations on four continents in 31 countries with a well-developed European network including the transcontinental nation of Russia. The airline serves a number of gateway cities in North America such as New York–JFK, Newark, Miami, Los Angeles, and Boston. They have also expanded their service to Asia such as Bangkok–Suvarnabhumi, Mumbai, Beijing–Capital, and Hong Kong. From its founding until 2020, El Al&#x27;s inability to overfly Saudi Arabian airspace, along with that of several other Arab and Muslim countries, has reduced their ability to further expand their route network in Asia. In 2018, Saudi Arabia granted permission to Air India to fly a five times weekly flight from Tel Aviv to New Delhi using Saudi Arabian airspace. If Saudi Arabia did not allow El Al to use their airspace, El Al might have lost a large share of their Asian market due to other airlines having shorter and cheaper flights. However, Saudi Arabia opened airspace to Israeli aircraft for the first time in September 2020. El Al also offers services to Johannesburg in South Africa and Zanzibar.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, the airline had plans to perform experimental direct flights between Tel Aviv and Melbourne. The service would have been the airline&#x27;s longest-ever direct flight and the first direct connection between Israel and Australia.

In June 2022, the airline announced that it would permanently terminate flights from Toronto–Pearson effective October 27, 2022. The decision ended an over-40-year presence in Canada. In response, a petition was launched on Change.org to try and reverse the decision. El Al also announced that it was cancelling its routes to Brussels Airport and Warsaw Chopin Airport.

In December 2022, the airline started to sell tickets to its highly anticipated route of Ben Gurion Airport to Tokyo-Narita Airport, which was inaugurated on March 2, 2023. The route was originally planned to launch in March 2020, but due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the route was delayed until further notice.

On 14 March 2023, El Al and the Victoria state government signed a letter of intent, in which El Al intents to inaugurate direct flights to Melbourne Airport in Melbourne, Australia. While there is no exact date for the beginning of these flights, the letter of intent stated that these flights should begin by June 2024. These flights will be operated by the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and are expected to add 44,000 seats on flights to Melbourne per year. These flights will take 15 hours eastbound (Israel to Australia) and 17 hours westbound (Australia to Israel).

On 26 October 2023, El Al said it will cancel its seasonal routes (Dublin, Marseille, Tokyo) which were due to terminate in the October–November early due to the Israel–Hamas war and will delay the launch of its planned New Delhi &amp; Mumbai routes until further notice. El Al said it plans to resume their seasonal routes in April 2024 (the end of IATA&#x27;s winter schedule).
One of the oldest El Al routes, the flights to Johannesburg, South Africa was terminated in March 2024.

===Livery===
El Al&#x27;s historic, superseded livery featured a turquoise/navy blue stripe down the side of the aircraft, and a turquoise tailfin with the flag of Israel at the top. El Al&#x27;s logo was featured above the front run of windows on each side of the plane in the turquoise/navy scheme. The new livery features a blue stripe with a thick silver border on the bottom that sweeps across the side of the aircraft near the wing, disappears over the top of the plane and reappears at the bottom of the tailfin. The El Al logo is part of the design, although it has been changed slightly since then. Most of El Al&#x27;s aircraft are named for Israeli cities, such as Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Bet Shemesh, Nazeret, Haifa, and others. The larger the aircraft – the bigger or more populated the city it is named after. The cities&#x27; names are located near the nose of the plane beneath the cockpit windows. One aircraft, a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, is painted in the livery that El Al used in the 1960s and 1970s as part of the airline&#x27;s 70th year of operations, using a gray belly, white roof with El Al titles, a blue cheatline, and the flag of Israel on the vertical stabilizer that was introduced with the introduction of the Boeing 707 to the El Al fleet.

By contrast, El Al&#x27;s cargo plane livery in the past lacks the painting of Israel&#x27;s flag and its airline identity; only the word &quot;Cargo&quot; appears on the fuselage. Subsequently, the most recent cargo plane livery (a now retired Boeing 747-400F) was painted white except for the airline&#x27;s name and &quot;Cargo&quot;.

== Accidents and incidents ==
Over its history, El Al has been involved in the following incidents and accidents, involving both the aircraft actually operated by the airline and its outstations abroad. Most of these incidents are related to Palestinian terrorism, particularly in the period between 1968 and 1990, and so incidents are separated by terrorist and non-terrorist incidents. Despite these attacks, El Al has not lost a passenger on any passenger flight since 1955.

=== Terrorist attacks and incidents ===
*On 23 July 1968, El Al Flight 426, operated by a Boeing 707-458C en route from London to Tel Aviv via Rome, registered 4X-ATA, was hijacked by three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) shortly after take-off from Rome-Fiumicino airport and forcibly diverted to Algiers. The hijacking ended after 40 days and is considered to be the only successful hijacking involving an El Al jet.
*On 18 February 1969, El Al Flight 432, operated Boeing 720-058B, registered 4X-ABB, was attacked at Zurich Airport by members of the PFLP while taxiing for takeoff en route from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv, via a Zurich intermediate stop. Seven people were wounded including the copilot who later died from his wounds. In a firefight involving security personnel aboard the aircraft, one hijacker was killed, while the others were arrested. The hijackers were later put on trial in Winterthur, Switzerland but were released following the Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings one year later.
*On 6 September 1970, El Al Flight 219 from Tel Aviv to New York, with a stopover in Amsterdam, operated by a Boeing 707-458C registered 4X-ATB, was the target of an attempted hijacking by Leila Khaled and Patrick Argüello, members of the Sandinistas working in concert with the PLFP after taking off from Amsterdam. The hijacking was meant to be one of the Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings, but it was thwarted by the pilots, cabin crew and the on-board air marshals. The aircraft diverted to Heathrow Airport, where Argüello and Khaled were turned over to British authorities; Argüello, who was shot earlier, died en route to a hospital.
*On 16 August 1972, a bomb exploded in the luggage compartment of El Al Flight 444 shortly after takeoff from Rome. The plane returned to Rome safely and no casualties were recorded. The bomb had been hidden in the luggage of two British nationals who had the bombs placed there by Arab acquaintances.
*On 13 January 1975, several men, including Carlos the Jackal, made an unsuccessful attempt to destroy an El Al airliner parked at Paris Orly Airport. The men tried again on January 17, also without success.
*On 27 December 1985, after several failed attempts to attack El Al aircraft, guerrillas of the Fatah Revolutionary Council attacked El Al and TWA ticket counters at Rome-Fiumicino and Vienna-Schwechat airports, killing 18 people.
*A terrorist attack was foiled on 18 April 1986 in what became known as the Hindawi Affair. A pregnant Irishwoman named Anne-Marie Murphy was about to board an El Al flight at London&#x27;s Heathrow airport when her bag was found to contain three pounds of plastic explosives. These had been planted by her fiancé Nezar Hindawi, who was booked on a different flight. Hindawi was jailed for 45 years, the longest sentence (short of a life sentence) ever delivered by a British court. There was evidence that Syrian officials were involved and as a result, Britain cut off diplomatic relations with Syria.
*On 4 July 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet shot six Israeli passengers at El Al&#x27;s ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport before he was shot and killed by an El Al security guard. Two of the victims died. Although not linked to any terrorist group, Hadayet, an Egyptian, espoused anti-Israeli views and was opposed to US policy in the Middle East. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation classified the shooting as a terrorist act, one of the few on US soil since the September 11, 2001 attacks.
*On 17 November 2002, El Al Flight 581, a flight operated by a Boeing 767-258(ER) from Tel Aviv to Istanbul, registered 4X-EBS, was the scene of an attempted hijacking by Tawfiq Fukra, a twenty-three-year-old Israeli Arab reportedly armed with a pocket knife. Fukra attempted to break into the cockpit in order to fly the aircraft back to Israel and crash it into a building. He was apprehended by on-board security personnel.

=== Non-terrorist accidents and incidents ===
*On 24 November 1951, a Douglas DC-4, registered 4X-ADN, on a cargo flight from Tel Aviv to Amsterdam via Zurich crashed on approach to Zürich, killing 6 crew members.
*On 27 July 1955, a Lockheed Constellation operating El Al Flight 402, registered 4X-AKC, was shot down by two Bulgarian Air Force fighter jets over Blagoevgrad, near Sofia, Bulgaria, after it strayed into Bulgarian airspace in rough weather. All 58 passengers and crew were killed.
* On 4 October 1992, El Al Flight 1862, a cargo flight from New York to Tel Aviv via Amsterdam, operated by a Boeing 747-258F cargo plane registered 4X-AXG, crashed into two highrise apartment buildings (Kruitberg and Groeneveen) in Bijlmermeer, a neighborhood of Amsterdam, shortly after takeoff and while attempting to return to Amsterdam. The crash was caused by structural failure of the fuse pins on the #3 engine, causing that engine to detach from the aircraft, knocking off the #4 engine with it, causing the aircraft to roll to the right. The three crew members, one passenger in a jump seat, and 39 people on the ground were killed.

<text>A logic puzzle is a puzzle deriving from the mathematical field of deduction.
==History==
The logic puzzle was first produced by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, who is better known under his pen name Lewis Carroll, the author of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. In his book &quot;The Game of Logic&quot; he introduced a game to solve problems such as confirming the conclusion &quot;Some greyhounds are not fat&quot; from the statements &quot;No fat creatures run well&quot; and &quot;Some greyhounds run well&quot;. Puzzles like this, where we are given a list of premises and asked what can be deduced from them, are known as syllogisms. Dodgson goes on to construct much more complex puzzles consisting of up to 8 premises.

In the second half of the 20th century mathematician Raymond M. Smullyan continued and expanded the branch of logic puzzles with books such as &quot;The Lady or the Tiger?&quot;, &quot;To Mock a Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;Alice in Puzzle-Land&quot;. He popularized the &quot;knights and knaves&quot; puzzles, which involve knights, who always tell the truth, and knaves, who always lie.

There are also logic puzzles that are completely non-verbal in nature. Some popular forms include Sudoku, which involves using deduction to correctly place numbers in a grid; the nonogram, also called &quot;Paint by Numbers&quot;, which involves using deduction to correctly fill in a grid with black-and-white squares to produce a picture; and logic mazes, which involve using deduction to figure out the rules of a maze.

== Logic grid puzzles ==

Another form of logic puzzle, popular among puzzle enthusiasts and available in magazines dedicated to the subject, is a format in which the set-up to a scenario is given, as well as the object (for example, determine who brought what dog to a dog show, and what breed each dog was), certain clues are given (&quot;neither Misty nor Rex is the German Shepherd&quot;), and then the reader fills out a matrix with the clues and attempts to deduce the solution. These are often referred to as &quot;logic grid&quot; puzzles. The data set of a logic grid puzzles can be any number of categories, but are limited by the corresponding increase in complexity, with most having only two, three, or even four categories.

While designed more as a table-based puzzle than a matrix, the most famous example of a logic-grid puzzle may be the so-called Zebra Puzzle, which asks the question &quot;Who Owned the Zebra?&quot;.

Common in logic puzzle magazines are derivatives of the logic grid puzzle called &quot;table puzzles&quot; that are deduced in the same manner as grid puzzles, but lack the grid either because a grid would be too large, or because some other visual aid is provided. 
For example, a map of a town might be present in lieu of a grid in a puzzle about the location of different shops.

<text>The 8-track tape (formally Stereo 8; commonly called eight-track cartridge, eight-track tape, and eight-track) is a magnetic-tape sound recording technology that was popular from the mid-1960s until the late 1980s, when the compact cassette, which pre-dated the 8-track system, surpassed it in popularity for pre-recorded music.

The format was commonly used in cars and was most popular in the United States and Canada and, to a lesser extent, in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Japan. One advantage of the 8-track tape cartridge was that it could play continuously in an endless loop, and did not have to be ejected, turned around and reinserted to play the entire tape. After about 80 minutes of playing time, the tape would start again at the beginning. Because of the loop, there is no rewind. The only options the consumer has are play, fast forward, record, and program (track) change.

The Stereo 8 Cartridge was created in 1964 by a consortium led by Bill Lear, of Lear Jet Corporation, along with Ampex, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Motorola, and RCA Victor Records (RCA—Radio Corporation of America).

The 8-track tape format is now considered obsolete, although there are collectors who refurbish these tapes and players as well as some bands that issue these tapes as a novelty. Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;The Latest&quot; in 2009 was issued on 8-track, as was Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;A Holly Dolly Christmas&quot; in 2020, the latter with an exclusive bonus track. H8-Track Stereo started by Sean Beard released over 800 albums for artists on 8-track internationally from 2013 to 2019, inspiring an underground revival of the format that has yet to be exceeded.

== Technology ==
The cartridge&#x27;s dimensions are approximately . The magnetic tape is played at 3.75 inches per second (twice the speed of a cassette), is wound around a single spool, is about wide and contains 8 parallel tracks. The player&#x27;s head reads two of these tracks at a time, for stereo sound. After completing a program, the head mechanically switches to another set of two tracks, creating a characteristic clicking noise.

== History ==
=== Development===

Inventor George Eash invented a design in 1953, called the Fidelipac cartridge, also called the NAB cartridge, which would later be used in not only the Muntz Stereo-Pak but also in various monaural background music systems from the late 1960s to the early 1990s.

His inspiration came from one of the first products that used the endless tape cartridge technology, which was the Audio Vendor from a year earlier, an invention of Bernard Cousino. The tape is passed through an inner ring of loose tape reel, where the recording is stored, and looped back through the outer ring of the reel. Initially, this mechanism was to be implemented in a reel-to-reel audio tape recorder.

Later, Cousino developed a plastic case that could be mounted on some existing tape recorders. This cartridge was marketed by John Herbert Orr as Orrtronic Tapette. In this generation, the tape was wound with the magnetic coating facing the inside of the reel. Later cartridge types had the magnetic layer facing the outside of the reel, so it had to be played by a specially designed recorder. Once traction of the tape by capstan was added, users had the convenience of just pushing the cartridge into the recorder without having to thread the tape. These cassettes needed no internal space for the tape head slider because they accessed the tape from outside the cartridge.

Based on these new cassettes, George Eash developed the Fidelipac cartridge in 1954. PlayTape and the endless-loop compact cassettes for the announcement text of answering machines were made with this technique as well along with other similar but incompatible answering machine tapes. The original separate take-up reel got a platter laid under the supply reel to combine the two and the perforation around the edge of the reel for traction was removed. There was no rear winding reel inside such a cassette so rewinding was impossible. Previously, a similar technique was used to store Tefifon grooved-vinyl sonic tape in the Tefi cartridge but without the benefit of a reel due to the width being 16mm, over twice that of an 8-track and due to the thickness of the film at 3 mils (75μm).

Another similar technology was the LaBelle Tutor 16 which combined several endless loop technologies at once. A 35mm filmstrip was reduced to 16mm and loaded into an endless loop film cartridge similar to a Fisher Price Movie Viewer which used silent truncated versions of 16mm cartoons. The bottom of this cartridge acted as the top for the sound cartridge below it which was basically identical to an 8-track. The only difference was the recording was the same 2-track format as mono NAB carts at the same 3-3/4 IPS speed (9.5 cm/s) as an 8-track with the program material on one track and the subsonic picture-change automation tone on the other track.

Films, both silent as well as sound, in 8mm as well as 16mm configurations and in optical as well as magnetic sound formats were also endless loops, used in everything from store end-cap sales tools, to on-the-road engineering instructions to early portable airline movies. Instead of having any part of the mechanism located inside the cartridge, the only part located there was a 45-degree mirror to reflect the light through the film and onto either the internal frosted screen or an external screen by way of flipping another mirror in to redirect the picture.

=== Stereo 8 ===

The Lear Jet Stereo 8 cartridge was designed by Richard Kraus while working for the Lear Jet Corporation, under Bill Lear, in 1963. The major change was to incorporate a neoprene rubber and nylon pinch roller into the cartridge itself, rather than to make the pinch roller a part of the tape player, reducing mechanical complexity. Lear also eliminated some of the internal parts of the Eash cartridge, such as the tape-tensioning mechanism and an interlock that prevented tape slippage. Because the Stereo-Pak cartridges were prone to jamming due to their complex design, Lear endeavored to redesign them, putting twice the number of tracks on them, doubling their recording time first to 80 minutes and then extending that to 100 minutes.

=== Discrete Quadraphonic 8-track ===
Four-channel 8-tracks were distinguishable by the notch in the upper left hand corner as in the picture to the right. Blanks such as this one were sold with a white spacer occupying the notch the same as 45 rpm adapter were sold to convert 7-inch (19 cm) large hole singles so that they could be played on conventional turntables. This notch activated the second set of tracks on the new head which would have originally played Programs 3 and 4 of a stereo tape and used them simultaneously with heads that would read Programs 1 and 2.

Tapes were first marketed for the Fall, 1970 music season. Oddly, the last Stereo-Pak four &quot;track&quot; Muntz cartridge tapes (vs four &quot;channel&quot; quadraphonic) were still being produced at the same time as well as regular Stereo 8 tapes.

=== Time limitations ===
Going back to using the same amount of tape for an album as a Stereo-Pak was a little annoying to consumers because &quot;Two Albums on One Tape for the Same Low Price (as an LP)&quot; was now impossible. Quadraphonic issues of double albums on 8-track had to occupy two or even (in the case of classical music) three tapes.

If an album ran over 50 minutes, half the time that could be recorded on a Stereo 8-track, and there was not enough program material to justify a second tape, producers would edit or eliminate some songs to make the album fit the 25-minute-per-program time limit. Commercial recordings were going back to a slightly smaller version of the same truncated program problems that plagued 2-track stereo tapes 20 years earlier. Quadraphonic cassettes were experimented with starting in 1974, but never gained a toe-hold until cassette portastudios established themselves ten years later just before digital took off.

=== Commercial success ===
The popularity of both four-track and eight-track cartridges grew from the booming automobile industry. In September 1965, the Ford Motor Company introduced factory-installed and dealer-installed eight-track tape players as an option on three of its 1966 models (the sporty Mustang, luxurious Thunderbird, and high-end Lincoln), and RCA Victor introduced 175 Stereo-8 Cartridges from its RCA Victor and RCA Camden labels of recording artists catalogs. By the 1967 model year, all of Ford&#x27;s vehicles offered this tape player upgrade option. Most of the initial factory installations were separate players from the radio (such as shown in the image), but dashboard mounted 8-track units were offered in combination with an AM radio, as well as with AM/FM receivers.

The 8-track format gained steadily in popularity because of its convenience and portability. Home players were introduced in 1966 that allowed consumers to share tapes between their homes and portable systems. By the late 1960s, the 8-track segment was the largest in the US consumer electronics market (Low UK &amp; Europe sales as Compact Cassette was released 1962) and the popularity of 8-track systems for cars helped generate demand for home units. &quot;Boombox&quot; type portable players were also popular but eight-track player/recorders failed to gain wide popularity and few manufacturers offered them except for manufacturer Tandy Corporation (for its Radio Shack electronics stores). With the availability of cartridge systems for the home, consumers started thinking of eight-tracks as a viable alternative to 33 rpm album style vinyl records, not only as a convenience for the car. Also by the late 1960s, prerecorded releases on the 8-track tape format began to arrive within a month of the vinyl release. The 8-track format became by far the most popular and offered the largest music library of all the tape systems in the US.

=== Early karaoke machines ===
Daisuke Inoue invented the first karaoke machine in 1971 called the Juke-8.

=== Other use ===
Milton Bradley&#x27;s OMNI Entertainment System was an electronic quiz machine game first released in 1980, similar to &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; or later entries in the &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; video game series, using 8-track tapes for questions, instructions, and answers, using audio playback as well as digital signals in magnetic-tape data storage on remaining tracks to load the right answer for counting the score. In 1978, the Mego Corporation launched the 2-XL toy robot, which utilized the tracks for determining right from wrong answers. In 1977, the Scottish company GR International released the Bandmaster Powerhouse, a drum machine that played back custom-made 8-track cartridges similar to a Mellotron or Chamberlin Music Master containing drum and percussion rhythm loops recorded with real instruments. These could be subjected to a degree of processing using the drum machine&#x27;s controls, which included tempo and instrument balance.

===Decline===
In the United States, 1978 was the peak year for 8-track sales but sales declined rapidly from then on. Eight-track players became less common in homes and vehicles in the late 1970s, dwarfed by the compact cassette (which arrived in 1963). By 1980, the eight-track was already being phased out in favor of cassettes, whose sales were rapidly increasing partly due to the success of the Walkman and eventually caught up and dethroned LPs by 1983.

In the U.S., eight-track cartridges were phased out of retail stores in late 1982 and early 1983. However, some titles were still available as eight-track tapes through Columbia House and RCA (BMG) Music Service record clubs until late 1988. Until 1990, Radio Shack (Tandy Corporation) continued to sell blank eight-track cartridges and players for home recording use under its Realistic brand.

<doc id="101597" wikidata="Q2548710" url="?curid=101597" title="Hoveton">
<text>Hoveton is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It is located within the Norfolk Broads, and immediately across the River Bure from the village of Wroxham. Hoveton is north of the river, with Wroxham to the south, but the whole settlement is commonly referred to as &quot;Wroxham&quot;.

The villages name origin is uncertain, deriving from either &quot;Hofa&#x27;s farm/settlement&quot; or perhaps, &quot;ale-hoof farm/settlement&quot;. Ale-hoof is probably ground-ivy (glechoma hederacea)

==Administration==
The civil parish has an area of 10.2 km2 and in the 2001 census had a population of 1,804 in 873 households, the population decreasing to 1759 at the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of North Norfolk.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward had a population of 1 at the 2011 Census.

==Transport==
Hoveton is served by Hoveton &amp; Wroxham railway station, which is on the Bittern Line from Norwich to Cromer and Sheringham, and which is adjacent to the terminus of the narrow gauge Bure Valley Railway to Aylsham. The station was originally intended to be on the Wroxham side of the river, but a change of plan resulted in it being sited in Hoveton; however, it was misleadingly named &quot;Wroxham&quot; until being renamed &quot;Hoveton &amp; Wroxham&quot; in 1966. Locals and regular visitors still refer to the station as &quot;Wroxham&quot;, which can lead to confusion when purchasing a ticket in other parts of the country.

==Local facilities==
Hoveton has three churches, St Peter, St John and St Helen&#x27;s Catholic Church. The town has tourist shops, pubs, cafés and a gift shop. 

It is a popular place for tourists due to the largest village store and is also one of the busiest places to boat in Norfolk.

Roys of Wroxham, dubbed &quot;the world&#x27;s largest village store&quot;, was founded in Coltishall by Alfred Roy in 1895, with a third store opening in Hoveton in 1899. Roys includes a department store, a supermarket, a garden centre, a toy shop and a DIY store in Hoveton with a petrol station in Wroxham and many other department stores and supermarkets across Norfolk and Suffolk.

Broadland High Ormiston Academy is located in Hoveton.

Hoveton Old Hall dates from 1567 and features a Queen Anne-style 17th century wing.

Hoveton Hall is a 19th-century building attributed to Humphry Repton. Although the house is not open to the public, its gardens are a popular tourist attraction. Hoveton Great Broad and Hoveton Little Broad carry the village&#x27;s name.

==Notable people==
*Anthony Aufrère (1757–1833), barrister and translator
*Henry Blofeld (b. 1939), cricket commentator
*Sir John Blofeld (b. 1932), judge
*Tom Blofeld (b. 1964), writer
*Alan Hunter (1922–2005), writer
*Louise Jermy (1877–1952), servant, who was encouraged by the local WI to publish her autobiography

==Famous connections==
The Norfolk landscape painter John Crome, an associate of John Sell Cotman and others of the Norwich school, made an etching of Hoveton around 1812.

<text>Michael Carbajal (born September 17, 1967) is an American five-time world boxing champion of Mexican descent. His nickname was &quot;Little Hands of Stone&quot; after his favorite boxer, &quot;Hands of Stone&quot; Roberto Durán.

==Amateur career==
Carbajal had an amateur record of 94-9 and won a silver medal as a light flyweight at 1988 Seoul Olympics in South Korea.

===Highlights===
* 1986 National Golden Gloves Light Flyweight champion
* 1987 – Carbajal won the silver medal at the 1987 Pan American Games
* 1988 – United States amateur Light Flyweight champion

===1988 Olympic Results===
Below are the results of Michael Carbajal, an American light flyweight boxer who competed at the 1988 Seoul Olympics:

* Round of 32: Defeated Kwang-Soo Oh (South Korea) points (3:2 decision)
* Round of 16: Defeated Dang Hieu Hien (Vietnam) points
* Quarterfinal: Defeated Scotty Olson (Canada) points
* Semifinal: Defeated Robert Isaszegi (Hungary) points
* Final: Lost to Ivailo Marinov (Bulgaria) points (0:5 decision)
There were suspicions of politics influencing the judges in Carbajal&#x27;s decision loss in the gold medal bout.

==Professional career==
Seven months after the Olympics, in February 1989, Carbajal made his debut in front of a national television audience as part of the card where Duran became a four-time world champion by beating Iran Barkley in Atlantic City. In his first fight, Carbajal outboxed another future world champion, Will Grigsby.

Carbajal followed that win with a spectacular first-round knockout of Silviano Perez on NBC. In his tenth bout, he met Pedro Feliciano, handling him a ten-round beating. Four more wins followed, and Carbajal was presented with an opportunity to fight for a world championship.

===IBF light flyweight title===
On July 29, 1990, Carbajal faced Muangchai Kittikasem, who came to Phoenix from Thailand to defend his IBF light flyweight championship. Carbajal methodically took apart the champion in front of an ABC national audience. In round 7, after a combination of punches left Kittikasem lying defenseless against the ropes, the referee stepped in and stopped the fight, making Carbajal the world champion for the first time in his career.

Carbajal began a string of twelve victories over the next two and a half years, including six title defenses against challengers such as Leon Salazar, Hector Patri, Kim Kwang-Sun and Robinson Cuesta, and a win over future champion Jesus Chong in a non-title fight.

===Unification against Humberto &quot;Chiquita&quot; Gonzalez===
He then fought a highly anticipated unification match with WBC champion Humberto González on March 13, 1993. Carbajal and Gonzalez became the first Junior Flyweights in history to earn a million dollar purse, and it was the first Junior Flyweight &quot;superfight&quot; and championship bout to headline a Pay Per View event.

Carbajal was downed in rounds 2 and 5, and he was bleeding from his right eyebrow when he blasted a tremendous left hand to the side of Gonzalez&#x27;s chin in the seventh round. Gonzalez turned sideways, and Carbajal landed another right hand that sent him to the canvas. Gonzalez could not beat the count, and Michael Carbajal had unified the world&#x27;s Junior Flyweight championship in The Ring&#x27;s fight of the year. He would also be named fighter of the year for 1993.

Many television endorsement deals followed, including printed and television ads for Diet Pepsi and Emergency Chiropractic, but trouble seemed to follow, as well. He was accused of firing gunshots onto the roof of a party in Scottsdale.

This unwanted attention seemed to take its toll on Carbajal, and after two additional defenses, he fought Gonzalez once again in a pay-per-view match in Los Angeles, California. In his 11th world title fight, Carbajal suffered the first loss of his career as he was defeated by a controversial 12 round split decision.

===WBO light flyweight title===
Carbajal next took on former sparring partner Abner Barajas, winning by a fifth-round knockout in Laughlin, Nevada, and then was given another shot at a world title by the WBO title holder Josue Camacho, who came from Puerto Rico to the challenger&#x27;s hometown to defend his title. Carbajal put on a brilliant performance and won a unanimous twelve-round decision over Camacho.

A title holder again, Carbajal set to try to recover his International Boxing Federation and WBC belts against Gonzalez in a third unification bout between the boxers. In November 1994, three months after the Camacho victory, they met once again, this time in Mexico City. Once again, it was a split decision, and once again, Carbajal came out on the losing end. He wouldn&#x27;t give up, however, and he kept training under the guidance of his brother, Danny Carbajal, the only man ever to train Michael.

===IBF light flyweight title===
He put another string of seven wins together, against the likes of former world champion Jose Quirino, whom he stopped in one round, and tough Mauro Salas, who lasted seven. Then he met two-time world champion Melchor Cob Castro in Las Vegas for the vacant International Boxing Federation Junior Flyweight title. Carbajal beat Castro by unanimous decision to claim his fourth world title.

His third title reign lasted 22 months and three defenses, including an eighth-round knockout of tough two-time challenger Tomas Rivera, before he lost his crown again. On January 18, 1997, Carbajal suddenly looked aged and was unable to do anything against the charges of Colombian Mauricio Pastrana. Carbajal still made the fight close, but lost a twelve-round split decision.

After that, Carbajal met Canada&#x27;s Scotty Olson in San Antonio, Texas. Carbajal showed he had more left than Olson did, and dominated the fight until a spectacular right hand sent Olson down for the count in round 11.

The win over Olson gave Carbajal a minor title, but in July 1997 in Las Vegas once again, he was defeated by South Africa&#x27;s Jacob Matlala. Matlala handed Carbajal his first inside the distance defeat ever, stopping the past-his-prime former world champion in round nine via cuts. Carbajal did not fight for 19 months after this defeat.

===Second comeback, WBO title win, and retirement===
Carbajal announced a comeback early in 1999. He won three bouts, including a tko victory over former champion José de Jesús, and on July 31, 1999, he took the short flight from Phoenix to Tijuana to challenge WBO world Junior Flyweight champion Jorge Arce, who was fighting in his hometown. Arce dominated Carbajal for nine of the first ten rounds, but Carbajal floored the 21-year-old Arce in the sixth round. The fight moved along, and in the 11th round, Carbajal struck Arce with a right hand that sent him into the ropes. The referee stopped the fight, and Michael Carbajal was a world champion for the fifth time.

After this fight, Carbajal retired as a world champ. Carbajal is trying to live a quieter life nowadays in Phoenix, but he does many public appearances. He enjoys meeting his public and signing autographs for his fans. Carbajal also owns two boxing gyms in Phoenix.

Michael Carbajal and former rival Humberto González were elected together to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2006.

His career record was 49 wins against four losses, with 33 wins coming by way of knockout.

<doc id="101600" wikidata="Q170980" url="?curid=101600" title="Obelisk">
<text>An obelisk (; , diminutive of (&quot;&quot;) &#x27; spit, nail, pointed pillar&#x27;) is a tall, slender, tapered monument with four sides and a pyramidal or pyramidion top. Originally constructed by Ancient Egyptians and called &quot;tekhenu&quot;, the Greeks used the Greek term to describe them, and this word passed into Latin and ultimately English. Though William Thomas used the term correctly in his &quot;Historie of Italie&quot; of 1549, by the late sixteenth century (after reduced contact with Italy following the excommunication of Queen Elizabeth), Shakespeare failed to distinguish between pyramids and obelisks in his plays and sonnets. Ancient obelisks are monolithic and consist of a single stone; most modern obelisks are made of several stones.

==Ancient obelisks==

===Egyptian===
Obelisks were prominent in the architecture of the ancient Egyptians, and played a vital role in their religion placing them in pairs at the entrance of the temples. The word &quot;obelisk&quot; as used in English today is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because Herodotus, the Greek traveler, was one of the first classical writers to describe the objects. A number of ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the &quot;unfinished obelisk&quot; found partly hewn from its quarry at Aswan. These obelisks are now dispersed around the world, and fewer than half of them remain in Egypt.

The earliest temple obelisk still in its original position is the red granite Obelisk of Senusret I of the Twelfth Dynasty at Al-Matariyyah in modern Heliopolis.

In Egyptian mythology, the obelisk symbolized the sun god Ra, and during the religious reformation of Akhenaten it was said to have been a petrified ray of the Aten, the sundisk. Benben was the mound that arose from the primordial waters Nu upon which the creator god Atum settled in the creation story of the Heliopolitan creation myth form of Ancient Egyptian religion. The Benben stone (also known as a pyramidion) is the top stone of the Egyptian pyramid. It is also related to the obelisk.

Both New York University Egyptologist Patricia Blackwell Gary and &quot;Astronomy&quot; senior editor Richard Talcott hypothesize that the shapes of the ancient Egyptian pyramid and obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the sun (the sun-god Ra being the Egyptians&#x27; greatest deity at that time). The pyramid and obelisk&#x27;s significance have been previously overlooked, especially the astronomical phenomena connected with sunrise and sunset: Zodiacal light and sun pillars respectively.

==== Nubian ====
Ancient Nubian kings of the twenty-fifth Dynasty sought to legitimize their rule over Egypt by constructing Egyptianizing monuments in the Middle Nile region. Historical sources mention that king Piye built at least one obelisk. The obelisk was made of local black granite and was found at the site of Kadakol. It had been cut down to make it into a column, presumably for one of the early Christian churches in the area of Old Dongola. Today the obelisk is exhibited in the National Museum in Khartoum. The obelisk is inscribed with the kings official titulary: &quot;Strong-bull, Appearing-in-Dominion (Thebes), King-of-Upper-and-Lower-Egypt, Two-ladies, Ruler-of-Egypt, Son-of-Rê, Pi(ankh)y: what he made as his monument for his father Amen-Rê, lord of [...]&quot;.

An obelisk of King Senkamanisken was found at Gebel Barkal in 1916 by the Harvard University Museum of Fine Arts expedition to Sudan. There are remains of another small obelisk inscribed with the cartouche of King Aktisanes at the site of Gebel Barkal.

==== Ancient Egyptian obelisks in Ancient Rome ====

Around 30 BCE, Rome seized control of Egypt and looted the various temple complexes; in one case they destroyed walls at the Temple of Karnak to haul them out. There are now more than twice as many obelisks that were seized and shipped out by Rome as remain in Egypt. The majority were dismantled during the Roman period over 1,700 years ago and the obelisks were sent to different locations.

The largest standing and tallest Egyptian obelisk is the Lateran Obelisk in the square at the west side of the Lateran Basilica in Rome at tall and a weight of . More well known is the iconic , Vatican obelisk at Saint Peter&#x27;s Square. Brought to Rome by the Emperor Caligula in 37 CE, it has stood at its current site and on the wall of the Circus of Nero, flanking St Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

Pope Sixtus V was determined to erect the obelisk in front of St Peter&#x27;s, of which the nave was yet to be built. He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. Domenico Fontana, the assistant of Giacomo Della Porta in the Basilica&#x27;s construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project. Half-buried in the debris of the ages, it was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, was watched by a large crowd. It was a famous feat of engineering, which made the reputation of Fontana, who detailed it in a book illustrated with copperplate etchings, &quot;Della Trasportatione dell&#x27;Obelisco Vaticano et delle Fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V&quot; (1590), which itself set a new standard in communicating technical information and influenced subsequent architectural publications by its meticulous precision. Before being re-erected the obelisk was exorcised. It is said that Fontana had teams of relay horses to make his getaway if the enterprise failed. When Carlo Maderno came to build the Basilica&#x27;s nave, he had to put the slightest kink in its axis, to line it precisely with the obelisk.

Three more obelisks were erected in Rome under Sixtus V: at Santa Maria Maggiore, in 1587; at the Lateran Basilica, in 1588; and at the Piazza del Popolo, in 1589. An obelisk stands in front of the church of Trinità dei Monti, at the head of the Spanish Steps. Other notable Egyptian obelisks in Rome are found in Piazza della Minerva, sculpted while being carried on the back of an elephant, Piazza Montecitorio, Piazza della Rotonda, the Baths of Diocletian, and Villa Celimontana. Rome lost one of its obelisks, the Boboli obelisk which had decorated the temple of Isis, where it was uncovered in the 16th century. The Medici claimed it for the Villa Medici, but in 1790 they moved it to the Boboli Gardens attached to the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, and left a replica in its place.

Not all the Egyptian obelisks in the Roman Empire were set up at Rome: Herod the Great imitated his Roman patrons and set up an obelisk, Caesarea obelisk, made out of Egyptian red granite in the hippodrome of his new city Caesarea in northern Judea. This one is about tall and weighs about . It was discovered by archaeologists and has been re-erected at its former site.

In 357 CE, Emperor Constantius II had two Karnak Temple obelisks removed and transported down the Nile to Alexandria to commemorate his &quot;ventennalia&quot;, the 20th year of his reign. Afterward, one was sent to Rome and erected on the &quot;spina&quot; of the Circus Maximus, and is today known as the Lateran Obelisk. The other one, known as the Obelisk of Theodosius, remained in Alexandria until 390 CE, when Emperor Theodosius I had it transported to Constantinople (now Istanbul) and put up on the &quot;spina&quot; of the Hippodrome of Constantinople (now Sultan Ahmet Square). It once stood tall and weighed ; however, its lower section (which reputedly also once stood in the hippodrome) is now lost, reducing the obelisk&#x27;s size to .

==== Ancient Egyptian obelisks in modern cities ====
The Ancient Romans populated their city with 8 large and 42 small Egyptian obelisks. More have been re-erected elsewhere, and the best-known examples outside Rome are the pair of Cleopatra&#x27;s Needles in London, England (), and New York City, US (), and the over- Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.

Obelisks were being shipped out of Egypt as late as the nineteenth century when three of them were sent to London, New York and Paris. Their transportation was covered by various newspapers.

===Assyrian===
Obelisk monuments are also known from the Assyrian civilization, where they were erected as public monuments that commemorated the achievements of the Assyrian king.

The British Museum possesses four Assyrian obelisks:

The White Obelisk of Ashurnasirpal I (named due to its colour), was discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in 1853 at Nineveh. The obelisk was erected by either Ashurnasirpal I (1050–1031 BCE) or Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BCE). The obelisk bears an inscription that refers to the king&#x27;s seizure of goods, people and herds, which he carried back to the city of Ashur. The reliefs of the Obelisk depict military campaigns, hunting, victory banquets and scenes of tribute bearing.

The Rassam Obelisk, named after its discoverer Hormuzd Rassam, was found on the citadel of Nimrud (ancient Kalhu). It was erected by Ashurnasirpal II, though only survives in fragments. The surviving parts of the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing to the king from Syria and the west.

The Black Obelisk was discovered by Sir Austen Henry Layard in 1846 on the citadel of Kalhu. The obelisk was erected by Shalmaneser III and the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing as well as the depiction of two subdued rulers, Jehu the Israelite, and Sua the Gilzanean, making gestures of submission to the king. The reliefs on the obelisk have accompanying epigraphs, but besides these the obelisk also possesses a longer inscription that records one of the latest versions of Shalmaneser III&#x27;s annals, covering the period from his accessional year to his 33rd regnal year.

The Broken Obelisk, that was also discovered by Rassam at Nineveh. Only the top of this monolith has been reconstructed in the British Museum. The obelisk is the oldest recorded obelisk from Assyria, dating to the 11th century BCE.

===Ancient Roman===
The Romans commissioned obelisks in an ancient Egyptian style. Examples include:
* Arles, France – Arles Obelisk, in Place de la République, a 4th-century obelisk of Roman origin
* Benevento, Italy – Domitian Obelisk
* Munich, Germany – Obelisk of Titus Sextius Africanus, at Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst, 1st century CE, 
* Rome – there are five, &quot;see List of obelisks in Rome&quot;

===Byzantine===

* Istanbul, Turkey – Walled Obelisk, at Hippodrome of Constantinople (now Sultan Ahmet Square), built by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (905–959) and originally covered with gilded bronze plaques

===Pre-Columbian===
The prehistoric Tello Obelisk, found in 1919 at &quot;Chavín de Huantar&quot; in Peru, is a monolith stele with obelisk-like proportions. It is 2.52 metres tall and was carved in a design of low relief with Chavín symbols, such as bands of teeth and animal heads. Long housed in the &quot;Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú&quot; in Lima, it was relocated to the &quot;Museo Nacional de Chavín&quot;, which opened in July 2008. The obelisk was named for the archaeologist Julio C. Tello, who discovered it and was considered the &#x27;father of Peruvian archaeology&#x27;. He was America&#x27;s first indigenous archaeologist.

==Modern obelisks==

===As commemorative monuments===
Egyptian obelisks remain a source of fascination, serving as a reminder of past glories and a symbol of state power. A majority of modern obelisks are built of masonry or concrete, so not monolithic like their Egyptian counterparts, and are often oversized. Examples from the 19th and 20th centuries include the Obelisk (1800) in Stockholm, Stone of the Empress (1835) in Helsinki, the Wellington Monument (1861) in Dublin, the Washington Monument (1884) in Washington, D.C., the Obelisk of Buenos Aires (1936) in Buenos Aires, the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes (1958) in Tiananmen Square, Beijing and the National Monument (1975) in Jakarta. A few, however, continue the ancient tradition of the monolithic obelisk.

===Others usages===
In Rome, the Via della Conciliazione, cleared in 1936–1950 to link Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica to the centre of the capital is lined with obelisks serving as lampposts.

In France and other European countries, monuments to the dead, such as headstones and grave markers, were very often given a form of obelisks, but they are of more modest size. The practice is also still widespread in the Islamic world.

Modern obelisks have also been used in surveying as boundary markers.

===Transportation and erection experiments===
In late summer 1999, Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehner teamed up with a &quot;NOVA&quot; crew to erect a 25-ton obelisk. This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a 2-ton obelisk and a 9-ton obelisk. Finally in August–September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully. First Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10–20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way. Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are listed here.

One experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about long and no more than . A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to and . The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.

The final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15° had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.

This experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations. It seems to have been supported by a 3,000 year-old papyrus scroll in which one scribe taunts another to erect a monument for &quot;thy lord&quot;. The scroll reads &quot;Empty the space that has been filled with sand beneath the monument of thy Lord.&quot; To erect the obelisks at Luxor with this method would have involved using over a million cubic meters of stone, mud brick and sand for both the ramp and the platform used to lower the obelisk. The largest obelisk successfully erected in ancient times weighed . A stele was found in Axum, but researchers believe it was broken while attempting to erect it.

<doc id="101604" wikidata="Q1620594" url="?curid=101604" title="Hirsutism">
<text>Hirsutism is excessive body hair on parts of the body where hair is normally absent or minimal. The word is from early 17th century: from Latin &quot;hirsutus&quot; meaning &quot;hairy&quot;. It usually refers to a male pattern of hair growth in a female that may be a sign of a more serious medical condition, especially if it develops well after puberty. Cultural stigma against hirsutism can cause much psychological distress and social difficulty. Discrimination based on facial hirsutism often leads to the avoidance of social situations and to symptoms of anxiety and depression.
Hirsutism is usually the result of an underlying endocrine imbalance, which may be adrenal, ovarian, or central. It can be caused by increased levels of androgen hormones. The amount and location of the hair is measured by a Ferriman–Gallwey score. It is different from hypertrichosis, which is excessive hair growth anywhere on the body.
Treatments may include certain birth control pills, antiandrogens, or insulin sensitizers.
Hirsutism affects between 5 and 15% of women across all ethnic backgrounds. Depending on the definition and the underlying data, approximately 40% of women have some degree of facial hair. About 10 to 15% of cases of hirsutism are idiopathic with no known cause.

== Causes ==
The causes of hirsutism can be divided into endocrine imbalances and non-endocrine etiologies. It is important to begin by first determining the distribution of body hair growth. If hair growth follows a male distribution, it could indicate the presence of increased androgens or hyperandrogenism. However, there are other hormones not related to androgens that can lead to hirsutism. A detailed history is taken by a provider in search of possible causes for hyperandrogenism or other non-endocrine-related causes. If the distribution of hair growth occurs throughout the body, this is referred to as hypertrichosis, not hirsutism.

=== Endocrine causes ===
Endocrine causes of hirsutism include:

* Ovarian cysts such as in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common cause in women. 
* Adrenal gland tumors, adrenocortical adenomas, and adrenocortical carcinoma, as well as adrenal hyperplasia due to pituitary adenomas (as in Cushing&#x27;s disease).
* Inborn errors of steroid metabolism such as in congenital adrenal hyperplasia, most commonly caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
* Acromegaly and gigantism (growth hormone and IGF-1 excess), usually due to pituitary tumors.

=== Non-endocrine causes ===
Causes of hirsutism not related to hyperandrogenism include:

* Familial: Family history of hirsutism with normal androgen levels.
* Drug-induced: medications were used before the onset of hirsutism. The recommendation is to stop the medication and replace it with another.
** Minoxidil 
** Androgens like testosterone, anabolic steroids, and androgenic progestins
* Valproic acid and methyldopa
* Pregnancy: Due to changes in hormone production
* Idiopathic: When no other cause can be attributed to an individual&#x27;s hirsutism, the cause is considered idiopathic by exclusion. In these cases, menstrual cycles and levels of conventionally tested androgens (testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) are normal. Around 10 to 15% of women with hirsutism have idiopathic hirsutism. Idiopathic hirsutism may be due to increased production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in hair follicles and hence may actually still be due to hyperandrogenism. It may be detectable by measurement of DHT or DHT metabolites.
** Rice et al. 2016 propose that idiopathic hirsutism is caused by epigenetic inheritance of discordant epigenetic markers. It is testable with current technology.

==Diagnosis==
Hirsutism is a clinical diagnosis of excessive androgenic, terminal hair growth. A complete physical evaluation should be done prior to initiating more extensive studies, the examiner should differentiate between widespread body hair increase and male pattern virilization. One method of evaluating hirsutism is the Ferriman-Gallwey Score which gives a score based on the amount and location of hair growth. The Ferriman-Gallwey Score has various cutoffs due to variable expressivity of hair growth based on ethnic background.

Diagnosis of patients with even mild hirsutism should include assessment of ovulation and ovarian ultrasound, due to the high prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as well as 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (because of the possibility of finding non-classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency). People with hirsutism may present with an elevated serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) level, however, additional imaging is required to discriminate between malignant and benign etiologies of adrenal hyperandrogenism. Levels greater than 700 μg/dL are indicative of adrenal gland dysfunction, particularly congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. However, PCOS and idiopathic hirsutism make up 90% of cases.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of hirsutism is indicated when hair growth causes patient distress. The two main approaches to treatment are pharmacologic therapies targeting androgen production/action, and direct hair removal methods including electrolysis and photo-epilation. These may be used independently or in combination.

=== Pharmacologic therapies ===
Common medications consist of antiandrogens, insulin sensitizers, and oral contraceptive pills. All three types of therapy have demonstrated efficacy on their own, however insulin sensitizers are shown to be less effective than antiandrogens and oral contraceptive pills. The therapies may be combined, as directed by a physician, in line with the patient&#x27;s medical goals. Antiandrogens are drugs that block the effects of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body.&quot;&quot; They are the most effective pharmacologic treatment for patient-important hirsutism, however they have teratogenic potential, and are therefore not recommended in people who are pregnant or desire pregnancy. Current data does not favor any one type of oral contraceptive over another.

&quot;List of medications:&quot;

* Bicalutamide: A pure antiandrogen. It is effective similarly to flutamide but is much safer as well as better-tolerated.
* Birth control pills that consist of an estrogen, usually ethinylestradiol, and a progestin are supported by the evidence. They are functional antiandrogens. In addition, certain birth control pills contain a progestin that also has antiandrogenic activity. Examples include birth control pills containing cyproterone acetate, chlormadinone acetate, drospirenone, and dienogest.
* Cyproterone acetate: A dual antiandrogen and progestogen. In addition to single form, it is also available in some formulations of combined oral contraceptives at a low dosage (see below). It has a risk of liver damage.
* Eflornithine: Blocks putrescine that is necessary for the growth of hair follicles.
* Finasteride and dutasteride: 5α-Reductase inhibitors. They inhibit the production of the potent androgen DHT. A meta-analysis showed inconsistent results of finasteride in the treatment of hirsutism.
* Flutamide: A pure antiandrogen. It has been found to possess equivalent or greater effectiveness than spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, and finasteride in the treatment of hirsutism. However, it has a high risk of liver damage and hence is no longer recommended as a first- or second-line treatment. Flutamide is safe and effective.
* GnRH analogues: Suppress androgen production by the gonads and reduce androgen concentrations to castrate levels.
* Metformin: Insulin sensitizer. Antihyperglycemic drug used for diabetes mellitus and treatment of hirsutism associated with insulin resistance (e.g. polycystic ovary syndrome). Metformin appears ineffective in the treatment of hirsutism, although the evidence was of low quality.
* Spironolactone: An antimineralocorticoid with additional antiandrogenic activity at high dosages

=== Other methods ===

* Electrology
* Epilation
* Laser hair removal
* Lifestyle change, including reducing excessive weight and addressing insulin resistance, may be beneficial. Insulin resistance can cause excessive testosterone levels in women, resulting in hirsutism.
* Shaving
* Waxing

<text>Troyes () is a commune and the capital of the department of Aube in the Grand Est region of north-central France. It is located on the Seine river about south-east of Paris. Troyes is situated within the Champagne wine region and is near the Orient Forest Regional Natural Park.

Troyes had a population of 61,996 inhabitants in 2018. It is the center of the Communauté d&#x27;agglomération Troyes Champagne Métropole, which was home to 170,145 inhabitants.

Troyes developed as early as the Roman era, when it was known as Augustobona Tricassium. It stood at the hub of numerous highways, primarily the Via Agrippa. The city has a rich historical past, from the Tricasses tribe to the liberation of the city on 25 August 1944 during the Second World War, including the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, the Council of Troyes, the marriage of Henry V and Catherine of France, and the Champagne fairs to which merchants came from all over Christendom. The city has a rich architectural and urban heritage: many buildings are protected as historical monuments, including the half-timbered houses (mainly of the 16th century) that survived in the old town. They have contributed to Troyes being designated as a City of Art and History.

Manufacturing of textiles, developed from the 18th century onwards, was a chief part of Troyes&#x27; economy until the 1960s. Today, Troyes is the European capital of factory outlets and trading, and has three brand centers.

==History==
Prehistoric evidence found in the Troyes area suggests that the settlement may have developed as early as 600 BC. Celtic grave-mounds have been found near the city, and Celtic artifacts have been excavated within the city grounds.

In the Roman era, Troyes was known as Augustobona Tricassium. Numerous highways intersected here, primarily the Via Agrippa, which led north to Reims and south to Langres, and eventually to Milan. Other Roman routes from Troyes led to Poitiers, Autun and Orléans.

It was the &quot;civitas&quot; of the Tricasses people, whom Augustus separated from the Senones. Of the Gallo-Roman city of the early Roman Empire, some scattered remains have been found, but no public monuments, other than traces of an aqueduct. By the late Empire the settlement had reduced in extent. It was referred to as Tricassium or Tricassae, the origin of French .

From the fourth century AD, the people had become Christian and the Church made the city the seat of a bishop. The legend of its bishop Lupus (Loup), who allegedly saved the city from Attila in 451 by offering himself as hostage, is hagiographic rather than historical. A disciple of Saint Lupus, Aventinus (Saint Aventin of Troyes, died 537) founded a monastery at Troyes. It was several centuries before Troyes gained importance as a medieval centre of commerce.

The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, also called the Battle of Troyes, took place nearby in 451 AD: the Roman general Flavius Aetius and the Visigothic king Theodoric I fought against Attila.

The early cathedral occupied the site of the current one. Here Louis the Stammerer in 878 received the crown of West Francia from Pope John VIII. At the end of the ninth century, following depredations of the city by Normans, the counts of Champagne chose Troyes as their capital. It remained the capital of the Province of Champagne until the Revolution of the late eighteenth century. The Abbey of Saint-Loup developed a renowned library and scriptorium.

During the Middle Ages, Troyes functioned as an important international trading town. It was the namesake of troy weight for gold - a standard of measurement developed here. The Champagne cloth fairs and the revival of long-distance trade, together with new extension of coinage and credit, were the drivers of the medieval economy of Troyes.

In 1040, Shlomo Yitzchaki, better known as Rashi, was born in Troyes. The rabbi and philosopher, a prominent commentator on the Bible and the Talmud, established an influential school of Jewish thought in the city.

In 1285, when King Philip the Fair united Champagne to the French royal domain, the town kept a number of its traditional privileges. John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy and ally of the English during the Hundred Years War, in 1417 worked to have Troyes designated as the capital of France. He came to an understanding with Isabeau of Bavaria, wife of King Charles VI of France, for the establishment at Troyes of a court, council, and parlement with comptroller&#x27;s offices.

On 21 May 1420, the Treaty of Troyes was signed in this city, still under control of the Burgundians, by which King Henry V of England was betrothed to Catherine, daughter of Charles VI. Under the terms of the treaty, Henry V, rather than the Dauphin, was to succeed Charles as King of France. The high-water mark of Plantagenet hegemony in France was reversed in 1429 when the Dauphin (afterwards King Charles VII) and Joan of Arc re-established French control of the town of Troyes by armed conflict (Siege of Troyes).

The great fire of 1524 destroyed much of the medieval city, although the city had numerous canals separating sections.

==Main sights==

* Many half-timbered houses (mainly of the 16th century) survive in the old town.
* &quot;Hôtels particuliers&quot; (mansions) of the old town
* The Hôtel de Ville on Place Alexandre Israël, is an urbane example of the &quot;style Louis XIII&quot;. On the central &quot;corps de logis,&quot; which contains the main reception rooms, its cornice is rhythmically broken forward over paired Corinthian columns; these are supported below by strong clustered pilasters. Above the entrance door the statue of Louis XIV was pulled out of its niche and smashed in 1793, during the Reign of Terror at the height of the French Revolution; it was replaced in the nineteenth century with the present &quot;Helmeted Minerva&quot; and the device in its original form. It is now rare to see &quot;Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité, ou la Mort&quot;. In the &quot;Salle du Conseil&quot; (Council Chamber) a marble medallion of Louis XIV (1690) by François Girardon, born at Troyes, survived the destruction unscathed.

==== Jewish Worship ====

Jewish worship is conducted in the Rashi Synagogue of Troyes, named in honor of Rabbi Salomon Ben Isaac, known as Rashi, the famous commentator of the Talmud. The current building was constructed on the site of an old abbey from the 16th century and replaced the synagogue destroyed during World War II. The building is in Renaissance style and was restored in the 20th century. It consists of a half-timbered house from the 16th century and another house dating from the 18th century (Louis XV style). A cultural center has also been established.

Recent renovations were undertaken to restore the synagogue to reflect the spirit of Rashi of Troyes&#x27; time. The inauguration took place on , in the presence of Haim Korsia, the Chief Rabbi of France.

<text>Albi (; ) is a commune in southern France. It is the prefecture of the Tarn department, on the river Tarn, 85 km northeast of Toulouse. Its inhabitants are called &quot;Albigensians&quot; (, ). It is the seat of the Archbishop of Albi.

The episcopal city, around the Cathedral Sainte-Cécile, was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 2010 for its unique architecture. The site includes the Musée Toulouse-Lautrec, dedicated to the artist who was born in Albi.

==Administration==
Albi is the seat of four cantons, covering 16 communes, with a total population of 72,416 (2019).

==History==
The first human settlement in Albi was in the Bronze Age (3000–600 BC). After the Roman conquest of Gaul in 51 BC, the town became &quot;Civitas Albigensium&quot;, the territory of the Albigeois, &quot;Albiga&quot;. Archaeological digs have not revealed any traces of Roman buildings, which seems to indicate that Albi was a modest Roman settlement.

In 584, Gregory of Tours reports that the majority of the townsfolk died from plague.

In 1040, Albi expanded and constructed the &quot;Pont Vieux&quot; (Old Bridge). New quarters were built, indicative of considerable urban growth. The city grew rich at this time, thanks to trade and commercial exchanges, and also to the tolls charged to travelers for using the Pont Vieux.

In 1208, the Pope and the French king joined forces to combat the Cathars, who had developed their own version of ascetic Christian dualism, and so a heresy considered dangerous by the dominant Catholic Church. Repression was severe, and many Cathars were burnt at the stake throughout the region. The area, until then virtually independent, was reduced to such a condition that it was subsequently annexed by the French Crown.

After the upheaval of the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars, the bishop Bernard de Castanet, in the late 13th century, completed work on the Palais de la Berbie, a Bishops&#x27; Palace with the look of a fortress. He ordered the building of the cathedral of Sainte-Cécile starting in 1282. The town enjoyed a period of commercial prosperity largely due to the cultivation of &quot;Isatis Tinctoria&quot;, commonly known as woad. The fine houses built during the Renaissance bear witness to the vast fortunes amassed by the pastel merchants.

Albi had a small Jewish community during medieval times, until it was annihilated in the 1320s Shepherds&#x27; Crusade. Afterwards, Jews were only allowed to transit the town by payment, without living in it. In 1967, approximately 70 Jews lived in Albi, most of them of North-African origin.

Albi has conserved its rich architectural heritage which encapsulates the various brilliant periods of its history. Considerable improvement and restoration work has been done, to embellish the old quarters and to give them a new look, in which brick reigns supreme.

==Main sights==
Albi was built around the original cathedral and episcopal group of buildings. This historic area covers 63 hectares. Red brick and tiles are the main feature of most of the edifices. Along with Toulouse and Montauban, Albi is one of the main cities built in Languedoc-style red brick.

Among the buildings of the town is the Sainte Cécile cathedral, a masterpiece of the Southern Gothic style, built between the 13th and 15th centuries. It is characterised by a strong contrast between its austere, defensive exterior and its sumptuous interior decoration. Built as a statement of the Christian faith after the upheavals of the Cathar heresy, this gigantic brick structure was embellished over the centuries: the &quot;Dominique de Florence&quot; Doorway, the 78 m high bell tower, the Baldaquin over the entrance (1515–1540). The rood screen is a filigree work in stone in the Flamboyant Gothic style. It is decorated with a magnificent group of polychrome statuary carved by artists from the Burgundian workshops of Cluny and comprising over 200 statues, which have retained their original colours.
Older than the &quot;Palais des Papes&quot; in Avignon, the &quot;Palais de la Berbie&quot;, formerly the Bishops&#x27; Palace of Albi, now the Toulouse-Lautrec Museum, is one of the oldest and best-preserved castles in France. This imposing fortress was completed at the end of the 13th century. Its name comes from the Occitan word &quot;Bisbia&quot;, meaning Bishops&#x27; Palace.

The Old Bridge (&quot;Pont Vieux&quot;) is still in use after almost a millennium. Originally built in stone (in 1035), then clad with brick, it rests on eight arches and is 151 m long. In the 14th century, it was fortified and reinforced with a drawbridge, and houses were built on the piers.

Albi is a city known for its elite &quot;Lycée Lapérouse&quot;, a high school with 500 students situated inside an old monastery. It has several advanced literature classes. Furthermore, it is one of the few holding a full-scale music section with special high-tech rooms for this section. The Pacific explorer Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse is commemorated in the museum.

Located in an ancient mill (41 rue Porta), the Le LAIT Art Centre is a research laboratory dedicated to contemporary art.

===Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec===
The Toulouse-Lautrec Museum houses more than 1000 works, including 31 famous posters. This body of work forms the largest public collection in the world devoted to Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who was born in Albi in 1864. 

===World Heritage Site===
UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Centre notes the Old Bridge (Pont-Vieux), the Saint-Salvi quarter, the quarter&#x27;s church, the fortified cathedral (late 13th century) in unique southern French Gothic style from local brick, the bishop&#x27;s Palais de la Berbie, and residential quarters, which help the Episcopal City of Albi form a &quot;coherent and homogeneous ensemble of monuments and quarters that has remained largely unchanged over the centuries... a complete built ensemble representative of a type of urban development in Europe from the Middle Ages to the present day.&quot;

==Transport==
Albi is served by two railway stations on the line from Toulouse to Rodez:
* Gare d&#x27;Albi-Ville
* Gare d&#x27;Albi-Madeleine

The A68 motorway connects Albi with Toulouse (and Lyon N 88, future motorway).

* SC Albi – The city&#x27;s rugby union team competing in the second-level Rugby Pro D2.
* RC Albi – A rugby league team that compete in the Elite One Championship.
* US Albi – A Union Sports Football Club established in 1912 in Albi playing the Regional 2 Level.

* Albi was the finish of Stage 5 of the 2023 Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift on Thursday, 27 July. The winner of the stage was Ricarda Bauernfeind (Germany) of Team Canyon/Sram Racing. Bauernfeind was riding in her Tour debut.

==Climate==
Albi experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) bordering oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;). Like much of southwestern France, the summers tend to be warmer and the winters milder than most areas of similar classification. Substantial summer rainfall prevents its climate from being classified as Mediterranean.
