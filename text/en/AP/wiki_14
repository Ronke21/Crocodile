<text>Mornington Crescent is a London Underground station in Somers Town in north-west London, named after the nearby street. It is on the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line, between and stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 2.

The station was opened as part of the original route of the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway (now the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line) on 22 June 1907. The surface building was designed by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London&#x27;s (UERL&#x27;s) architect Leslie Green in the Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style). Prior to the station&#x27;s opening, the name of &quot;Seymour Street&quot; had been proposed. After opening, it was little used. For many years it was open only on weekdays, and before 1966 Edgware-bound trains passed through without stopping.

==Location==
The station is situated at the southern end of Camden High Street, where it meets Hampstead Road and Eversholt Street. This junction forms the north-western corner of the boundary of Somers Town, with Camden Town situated to the north and Regent&#x27;s Park Estate to the south of the station.

The station&#x27;s location on the Northern line is unusual due to the dual-branch nature of that line. On the branch, Mornington Crescent is between and . The Bank branch also runs from Camden Town to Euston, but via tunnels which take an entirely different route to the Charing Cross branch and which do not pass through Mornington Crescent. Although modern-day tube maps show Mornington Crescent to the west of the Bank branch tunnels, it is actually to the east of them: the two branches cross over each other at Euston, so that between Euston and Camden Town, the Bank branch tunnels run to the west of the Charing Cross branch on which Mornington Crescent is situated. Harry Beck&#x27;s 1933 tube map represented this correctly.

There is a northwards facing crossover to the north of the station to enable trains from Camden Town to terminate and head back north.

==Closure and reopening==
On 23 October 1992, the station was shut so that the then 85-year-old lifts could be replaced. The intention was to open it within one year. However, due to lack of funding and the state of neglect, the station remained closed for 6 years.

A concerted campaign to reopen the station was launched, with pressure from Camden Council, and assistance from the popular BBC Radio 4 panel game &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;. The show frequently features the game &quot;Mornington Crescent&quot;, which takes its name from the station.

During the station&#x27;s rebuilding, the original distinctive light blue tiling pattern was restored to the station (though taking into account modern fire safety requirements). The ticket hall was reconstructed and the original emergency stairs closed. A second lift shaft was converted (losing the unnecessary extra two lifts) into a staircase on one side and a series of station facilities on the other.

After substantial refurbishment, the station was reopened on 27 April 1998 by the regular cast of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; (Humphrey Lyttelton, Barry Cryer, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden). A memorial plaque to the late Willie Rushton, one of the longest-serving panelists, was installed at the station in 2002.

Since its 1998 reopening, the station has been open at the same times as most other stations, including weekends, in an attempt to relieve the pressure on the increasingly busy nearby station.

== Services ==
The typical offpeak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:

* 20 tph Southbound to Kennington, of which 10 continue to Battersea power station 
* 10 tph Northbound to Edgware
* 8 tph Northbound to High Barnet
* 2 tph Northbound to Mill Hill East

The peak services differ between the morning and evening peaks, but generally the typical peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:

* 22 tph Southbound to Kennington, of which 6 continue to Morden and 12 continue to Battersea power station
* 12 tph Northbound to Edgware
* 10 tph Northbound to High Barnet
* 2 tph Northbound to Mill Hill East
==In popular culture==
===In film===
* The station was used as a location for the anthology film &quot;Tube Tales&quot; (1999).
*It was portrayed in the film &quot;Honest&quot; (2000), although the station actually used was Aldwych.
* In &quot;Allt flyter&quot; (2008), Sara meets her mother (who has moved there from Sweden for a sportscasting job) outside the station during a Christmas trip to London.

===In radio===
* &quot;Mornington Crescent&quot; is a spoof game, featured since the 1970s in the BBC Radio 4 comedy panel show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, which satirises complicated strategy games. A Comic Heritage blue plaque honouring Willie Rushton, one of the show&#x27;s longest-serving panelists, was installed within the station in 2002. It is located behind the ticket barrier at the top of the stairs to the platform.

===In literature===
* China Miéville mentions this station and its long state of disuse during the 1990s in his novel &quot;King Rat&quot; (1998), also using it as scene of a brutal murder by dismemberment via a passing train.
* In &quot;The Atrocity Archives&quot; (2004) by Charles Stross, the secret main entrance to the extremely secret Government establishment (the &quot;Laundry&quot;) which the protagonist Bob Howard works for is situated in the gentlemen&#x27;s toilets of Mornington Crescent tube station.
* In Christopher Fowler&#x27;s &quot;Bryant &amp; May&quot; mysteries, the offices of the Peculiar Crimes Unit are above Mornington Crescent tube station.
* Mornington Crescent is used by Robert Rankin in many of his novels as the home of the Ministry of Serendipity, a fictional agency whose main activity is to ensure the British Empire rules the globe, the top secret nature of the ministry being the main reason why the station was only open on weekdays and closed for &quot;repairs&quot; for much of the 1990s.

===In music===
* Belle &amp; Sebastian released a song entitled &quot;Mornington Crescent&quot; on their 2006 album, &quot;The Life Pursuit&quot;.
* My Life Story&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Mornington Crescent&quot; takes its name from the station, featuring photos in its sleeve notes.
* The promotional video for &quot;Be There&quot; by Unkle was filmed in this station.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 1, 24, 27, 29, 46, 134, 214, 253 and 274 and night routes N5, N20, N28, N29, N31, N253 and N279 serve the station.

<text>Leslie Samuel Phillips (20 April 1924 – 7 November 2022) was an English actor. He achieved prominence in the 1950s, playing smooth, upper-class comic roles utilising his &quot;Ding dong&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; catchphrases. He appeared in the &quot;Carry On&quot; and &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; film series as well as the long-running BBC radio comedy series &quot;The Navy Lark&quot;. On the stage, Phillips was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Comedy Performance in 1977. In his later career, Phillips took on dramatic parts including a BAFTA-nominated role alongside Peter O&#x27;Toole in &quot;Venus&quot; (2006). He provided the voice of the Sorting Hat in three of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.

==Early life==
Leslie Samuel Phillips was born in Tottenham on 20 April 1924, the third child of Cecelia Margaret (&quot;née&quot; Newlove) and Frederick Samuel Phillips, who worked at Glover and Main, manufacturers of cookers in Edmonton. Phillips described his street as &quot;beyond the sonic reach of the Bow Bells but within the general footprint of cockneydom.&quot; In 1931, the family moved to Chingford, where Phillips attended Larkswood Primary School. Consequently, Phillips has described himself as both a cockney and an Essex boy. In 1935, his father died at 44, having suffered from a weak heart and oedema brought on by the &quot;filthy, sulphurous&quot; air of the factory.

After his father&#x27;s death, Phillips was sent to the Italia Conti Academy at his mother&#x27;s insistence. There, he attended drama, dance and notably elocution to lose his cockney accent; at the time, a regional accent was considered an impediment to an aspiring actor. Phillips took time to refine his Received Pronunciation accent, and later declared that &quot;the biggest elocution lessons came from mixing with people who sounded right, people in theatrical circles and in the officers&#x27; mess during the war.&quot; He left school at 14 in 1938.

==Career==
===Early work===
Phillips made his stage debut in 1937 as a wolf in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; alongside Anna Neagle at the London Palladium. In the 1938–39 season, he was promoted to the role of John Napoleon Darling, alongside Jean Forbes-Robertson as Peter and Seymour Hicks as Captain Hook. Acting allowed Phillips to earn extra money for his family, who had struggled financially after his father&#x27;s death.

Phillips made his first film appearance in the 1938 musical comedy &quot;Lassie from Lancashire&quot;. He made further uncredited appearances in &quot;Climbing High&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Mikado&quot; (1939), among the earliest films made at Pinewood Studios. Upon the 70th anniversary of the studios in 2006, Phillips considered himself one of the earliest actors to have worked there still alive and working. A minor part in Ealing Studios&#x27; &quot;The Proud Valley&quot; (1940) afforded Phillips the chance to work alongside Paul Robeson, whom he greatly admired.

In the early years of the Second World War, Phillips worked in the West End for Binkie Beaumont and H. M. Tennent. The shows were frequently interrupted by air-raid sirens and Phillips later recalled that &quot;audiences would evaporate and head for cellars or Underground stations&quot;. Called up to the British Army in 1942, Phillips rose to the rank of lance-bombardier in the Royal Artillery. Due to his acquired upper class accent, Phillips was selected for officer training at Catterick and duly commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in 1943. He was transferred to the Durham Light Infantry in 1944 but was later declared unfit for service just before D-Day after being diagnosed with a neurological condition that caused partial paralysis. He was initially sent to a psychiatric hospital in error before moving to the correct facility for treatment.

Demobbed as a lieutenant in December 1944, Phillips&#x27;s acting career initially took in &quot;the murkiest rat-infested old and music halls in the north of England&quot;. He resumed his career as a film player, making uncredited appearances in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; and Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (both 1948). His first lead role in a television serial was in the sitcom &quot;My Wife Jacqueline&quot; (1952).

His big break in the films was in the Gene Kelly musical &quot;Les Girls&quot; (1957). Although the film was a critical success, he decided against a move to Hollywood, in part as he considered himself primarily a theatre actor and did not want to become &quot;the poor man&#x27;s David Niven&quot;. He began appearing in character roles in British comedy films including &quot;Brothers in Law&quot; and &quot;The Smallest Show on Earth&quot; (both 1957). In 1959, Phillips was cast in a minor role as Jack Bell in &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot;, the second in the &quot;Carry On&quot; film series. The character&#x27;s exclamation of &quot;Ding dong&quot; in the film became a popular catchphrase for Phillips. He became strongly associated with smooth-talking, libidinous roles, and his catchphrases &quot;Ding dong&quot;, &quot;I say&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; entered common usage in the United Kingdom. Phillips cemented his image in two further &quot;Carry On&quot; films, &quot;Carry On Teacher&quot; (1959) and &quot;Carry On Constable&quot; (1960) before telling producer Peter Rogers that he did not wish to appear in any more. &quot;Carry On&quot; director Gerald Thomas cast Phillips in several other comedy films; &quot;Please Turn Over&quot; (1959) features Phillips as Dr. Henry Manners, a respectable family doctor portrayed as a philanderer in a book written by 17-year-old Jo Halliday (Julia Lockwood), while he plays father David Robinson opposite Geraldine McEwan in &quot;No Kidding&quot; (1960).

Between 1959 and 1977, Phillips became familiar on radio, as Sub-Lieutenant Phillips in the comedy &quot;The Navy Lark&quot; alongside Jon Pertwee and Ronnie Barker. He also appeared in the film version of &quot;The Navy Lark&quot; (1959), the only cast member of the radio series to do so.

In 1960, Phillips was cast in &quot;Doctor in Love&quot;, the fourth film in the &quot;Doctor&quot; comedy series and the first without Dirk Bogarde. He appeared in two further installments, &quot;Doctor in Clover&quot; (1966) and &quot;Doctor in Trouble&quot; (1970). Phillips appeared in several comedy films directed by Ken Annakin, often cast alongside his &quot;Doctor&quot; co-star James Robertson Justice, including &quot;Very Important Person&quot; (1961), &quot;Raising the Wind&quot; (1961) and &quot;Crooks Anonymous&quot; (1962). In 1962, Phillips and Justice starred with Stanley Baxter in Annakin&#x27;s &quot;The Fast Lady&quot;, one of Britain&#x27;s biggest box office hits of the year. A loose sequel, &quot;Father Came Too!&quot;, followed in 1964.

During the 1960s, Phillips appeared on television in two plays penned by the comedy writing team Galton and Simpson; &quot;Impasse&quot;, broadcast as part of &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; in 1963, and &quot;The Suit&quot;, a 1969 episode of &quot;The Galton &amp; Simpson Comedy&quot;. The latter was developed into a full series four years later, &quot;Casanova &#x27;73&quot;, starring Phillips as compulsive philanderer Henry Newhouse. The programme was poorly received and attracted criticism from Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association for its risque content.

===Later work===
By the early 1980s, Phillips considered his suave and lecherous roles to be &quot;a bit of a rut&quot; and looked to branch out into dramatic roles. A relatively minor part in &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985) facilitated a larger role in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; (1987). To play an emaciated prisoner of war in the film, Phillips lost more than two stone. He became busy as a character actor in both stage and television productions including &quot;Scandal&quot; (1989) and &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; (2001). In 1992, he returned to the &quot;Carry On&quot; series in the poorly received &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot;. Phillips also provided the voice for the Sorting Hat in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, appearing in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001), &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002) and the final film, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; (2011).

Phillips appeared in British television sitcoms including &quot;Honey for Tea&quot; with Felicity Kendal and appeared in guest roles in popular series such as &quot;The Bill&quot;, &quot;Holby City&quot; and &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. In 2006, he played veteran actor Ian alongside Peter O&#x27;Toole in Hanif Kureishi&#x27;s film &quot;Venus&quot;. For this role, he was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actor in 2007. Phillips&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Hello&quot;, was published by Orion in 2006.

He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1998 Birthday Honours and was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours.

In 2012, Phillips voiced the audiobook edition of the legal thriller Chequered Justice, by John Bartlett (ISBN 9780956910486).

Phillips, in conjunction with Jules Williams and Back Door Productions, co-produced the Sky Arts series &quot;Living The Life&quot; which ran for three series, ending in 2013.

He continued to act until 2012 and continued to make television appearances until 2015 when he was interviewed on the BBC One programme &quot;VE Day: Remembering Victory&quot;.

==Personal life, illness and death==
Phillips married his first wife, actress Penelope Bartley (1925–1981), on 30 May 1948. The couple had four children. In 1962, Phillips began a relationship with actress Caroline Mortimer, daughter of writer Penelope Mortimer and stepdaughter of John Mortimer, who was an understudy in a stage play in which Phillips starred. Phillips and Bartley separated at that point and were divorced in 1965.

After his relationship with Mortimer ended, Phillips embarked on a relationship with Australian actress Vicki Luke, with whom he lived for approximately three years.

Phillips moved in with actress Angela Scoular in 1977, at which time she was pregnant by another actor. He raised her son as his own. While on tour in Australia in 1981, he was notified that Bartley had died in a fire. Phillips chose to continue in the production and did not attend her funeral. He later acknowledged that his family had never forgiven him for this decision.

Phillips married Scoular in 1982. In 1992 Scoular, who suffered from bipolar disorder, attempted suicide but was not sectioned. Scoular died on 11 April 2011 after drinking a corrosive drain cleaner and suffering unsurvivable 40% burns to her throat, body and dietary tract. She had suffered from bowel cancer and although was later declared cancer-free, she became anxious that the cancer had returned. Phillips was too ill to attend the inquest into Scoular&#x27;s death three months later. The coroner ruled that Scoular&#x27;s death was not suicide, but rather that she had &quot;killed herself while the balance of her mind was disturbed&quot;.

Phillips received the Freedom of the City of London on 16 November 2010. Phillips was a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur, and made an appearance as part of the half-time entertainment during the team&#x27;s home match against Swansea City on 1 April 2012.

On 20 December 2013, at the age of 89, Phillips married his third wife, Zara Carr.

Phillips suffered two strokes six months apart at the age of 90. After a long illness, he died in his sleep at home in London on 7 November 2022, aged 98.

<doc id="95807" wikidata="Q245341" url="?curid=95807" title="Radiography">
<text>Radiography is an imaging technique using X-rays, gamma rays, or similar ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation to view the internal form of an object. Applications of radiography include medical (&quot;diagnostic&quot; radiography and &quot;therapeutic radiography&quot;) and industrial radiography. Similar techniques are used in airport security, (where &quot;body scanners&quot; generally use backscatter X-ray). To create an image in conventional radiography, a beam of X-rays is produced by an X-ray generator and it is projected towards the object. A certain amount of the X-rays or other radiation are absorbed by the object, dependent on the object&#x27;s density and structural composition. The X-rays that pass through the object are captured behind the object by a detector (either photographic film or a digital detector). The generation of flat two-dimensional images by this technique is called projectional radiography. In computed tomography (CT scanning), an X-ray source and its associated detectors rotate around the subject, which itself moves through the conical X-ray beam produced. Any given point within the subject is crossed from many directions by many different beams at different times. Information regarding the attenuation of these beams is collated and subjected to computation to generate two-dimensional images on three planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) which can be further processed to produce a three-dimensional image.

==History==

Radiography&#x27;s origins and fluoroscopy&#x27;s origins can both be traced to 8 November 1895, when German physics professor Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovered the X-ray and noted that, while it could pass through human tissue, it could not pass through bone or metal. Röntgen referred to the radiation as &quot;X&quot;, to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. He received the first Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.

There are conflicting accounts of his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, but this is a likely reconstruction by his biographers: Röntgen was investigating cathode rays using a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide and a Crookes tube which he had wrapped in black cardboard to shield its fluorescent glow. He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 metre away. Röntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow: they were passing through an opaque object to affect the film behind it.

Röntgen discovered X-rays&#x27; medical use when he made a picture of his wife&#x27;s hand on a photographic plate formed due to X-rays. The photograph of his wife&#x27;s hand was the first ever photograph of a human body part using X-rays. When she saw the picture, she said, &quot;I have seen my death.&quot;

The first use of X-rays under clinical conditions was by John Hall-Edwards in Birmingham, England, on 11 January 1896, when he radiographed a needle stuck in the hand of an associate. On 14 February 1896, Hall-Edwards also became the first to use X-rays in a surgical operation.

The United States saw its first medical X-ray obtained using a discharge tube of Ivan Pulyui&#x27;s design. In January 1896, on reading of Röntgen&#x27;s discovery, Frank Austin of Dartmouth College tested all of the discharge tubes in the physics laboratory and found that only the Pulyui tube produced X-rays. This was a result of Pulyui&#x27;s inclusion of an oblique &quot;target&quot; of mica, used for holding samples of fluorescent material, within the tube. On 3 February 1896 Gilman Frost, professor of medicine at the college, and his brother Edwin Frost, professor of physics, exposed the wrist of Eddie McCarthy, whom Gilman had treated some weeks earlier for a fracture, to the X-rays and collected the resulting image of the broken bone on gelatin photographic plates obtained from Howard Langill, a local photographer also interested in Röntgen&#x27;s work.

X-rays were put to diagnostic use very early; for example, Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton opened a radiographic laboratory in the United Kingdom in 1896, before the dangers of ionizing radiation were discovered. Indeed, Marie Curie pushed for radiography to be used to treat wounded soldiers in World War I. Initially, many kinds of staff conducted radiography in hospitals, including physicists, photographers, physicians, nurses, and engineers. The medical speciality of radiology grew up over many years around the new technology. When new diagnostic tests were developed, it was natural for the radiographers to be trained in and to adopt this new technology. Radiographers now perform fluoroscopy, computed tomography, mammography, ultrasound, nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging as well. Although a nonspecialist dictionary might define radiography quite narrowly as &quot;taking X-ray images&quot;, this has long been only part of the work of &quot;X-ray departments&quot;, radiographers, and radiologists. Initially, radiographs were known as roentgenograms, while &quot;skiagrapher&quot; (from the Ancient Greek words for &quot;shadow&quot; and &quot;writer&quot;) was used until about 1918 to mean &quot;radiographer&quot;. The Japanese term for the radiograph, , shares its etymology with the original English term.

==Medical uses==

Since the body is made up of various substances with differing densities, ionising and non-ionising radiation can be used to reveal the internal structure of the body on an image receptor by highlighting these differences using attenuation, or in the case of ionising radiation, the absorption of X-ray photons by the denser substances (like calcium-rich bones). The discipline involving the study of anatomy through the use of radiographic images is known as radiographic anatomy. Medical radiography acquisition is generally carried out by radiographers, while image analysis is generally done by radiologists. Some radiographers also specialise in image interpretation. Medical radiography includes a range of modalities producing many different types of image, each of which has a different clinical application.

===Projectional radiography===

The creation of images by exposing an object to X-rays or other high-energy forms of electromagnetic radiation and capturing the resulting remnant beam (or &quot;shadow&quot;) as a latent image is known as &quot;projection radiography&quot;. The &quot;shadow&quot; may be converted to light using a fluorescent screen, which is then captured on photographic film, it may be captured by a phosphor screen to be &quot;read&quot; later by a laser (CR), or it may directly activate a matrix of solid-state detectors (DR—similar to a very large version of a CCD in a digital camera). Bone and some organs (such as lungs) especially lend themselves to projection radiography. It is a relatively low-cost investigation with a high diagnostic yield. The difference between &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; body parts stems mostly from the fact that carbon has a very low X-ray cross section compared to calcium.

===Computed tomography===

Computed tomography or CT scan (previously known as CAT scan, the &quot;A&quot; standing for &quot;axial&quot;) uses ionizing radiation (x-ray radiation) in conjunction with a computer to create images of both soft and hard tissues. These images look as though the patient was sliced like bread (thus, &quot;tomography&quot; – &quot;tomo&quot; means &quot;slice&quot;). Though CT uses a higher amount of ionizing x-radiation than diagnostic x-rays (both utilising X-ray radiation), with advances in technology, levels of CT radiation dose and scan times have reduced. CT exams are generally short, most lasting only as long as a breath-hold, Contrast agents are also often used, depending on the tissues needing to be seen. Radiographers perform these examinations, sometimes in conjunction with a radiologist (for instance, when a radiologist performs a CT-guided biopsy).

===Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry===
DEXA, or bone densitometry, is used primarily for osteoporosis tests. It is not projection radiography, as the X-rays are emitted in two narrow beams that are scanned across the patient, 90 degrees from each other. Usually the hip (head of the femur), lower back (lumbar spine), or heel (calcaneum) are imaged, and the bone density (amount of calcium) is determined and given a number (a T-score). It is not used for bone imaging, as the image quality is not good enough to make an accurate diagnostic image for fractures, inflammation, etc. It can also be used to measure total body fat, though this is not common. The radiation dose received from DEXA scans is very low, much lower than projection radiography examinations.

===Fluoroscopy===

Fluoroscopy is a term invented by Thomas Edison during his early X-ray studies. The name refers to the fluorescence he saw while looking at a glowing plate bombarded with X-rays.

The technique provides moving projection radiographs. Fluoroscopy is mainly performed to view movement (of tissue or a contrast agent), or to guide a medical intervention, such as angioplasty, pacemaker insertion, or joint repair/replacement. The last can often be carried out in the operating theatre, using a portable fluoroscopy machine called a C-arm. It can move around the surgery table and make digital images for the surgeon. Biplanar Fluoroscopy works the same as single plane fluoroscopy except displaying two planes at the same time. The ability to work in two planes is important for orthopedic and spinal surgery and can reduce operating times by eliminating re-positioning.

Angiography is the use of fluoroscopy to view the cardiovascular system. An iodine-based contrast is injected into the bloodstream and watched as it travels around. Since liquid blood and the vessels are not very dense, a contrast with high density (like the large iodine atoms) is used to view the vessels under X-ray. Angiography is used to find aneurysms, leaks, blockages (thromboses), new vessel growth, and placement of catheters and stents. Balloon angioplasty is often done with angiography.

===Contrast radiography===
Contrast radiography uses a radiocontrast agent, a type of contrast medium, to make the structures of interest stand out visually from their background. Contrast agents are required in conventional angiography, and can be used in both projectional radiography and computed tomography (called &quot;contrast CT&quot;).

===Other medical imaging===
Although not technically radiographic techniques due to not using X-rays, imaging modalities such as PET and MRI are sometimes grouped in radiography because the radiology department of hospitals handle all forms of imaging. Treatment using radiation is known as radiotherapy.

==Industrial radiography==
Industrial radiography is a method of non-destructive testing where many types of manufactured components can be examined to verify the internal structure and integrity of the specimen. Industrial Radiography can be performed utilizing either X-rays or gamma rays. Both are forms of electromagnetic radiation. The difference between various forms of electromagnetic energy is related to the wavelength. X and gamma rays have the shortest wavelength and this property leads to the ability to penetrate, travel through, and exit various materials such as carbon steel and other metals. Specific methods include industrial computed tomography.

==Image quality==
Image quality will depend on resolution and density.
Resolution is the ability of an image to show closely spaced structure in the object as separate entities in the image while density is the blackening power of the image.
Sharpness of a radiographic image is strongly determined by the size of the X-ray source. This is determined by the area of the electron beam hitting the anode.
A large photon source results in more blurring in the final image and is worsened by an increase in image formation distance. This blurring can be measured as a contribution to the modulation transfer function of the imaging system.

==Radiation dose==
The dosage of radiation applied in radiography varies by procedure. For example, the effective dosage of a chest x-ray is 0.1 mSv, while an abdominal CT is 10 mSv. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) have stated that the &quot;risks of medical imaging at patient doses below 50 mSv for single procedures or 100 mSv for multiple procedures over short time periods are too low to be detectable and may be nonexistent.&quot; Other scientific bodies sharing this conclusion include the International Organization of Medical Physicists, the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, and the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Nonetheless, radiological organizations, including the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and the American College of Radiology (ACR), as well as multiple government agencies, indicate safety standards to ensure that radiation dosage is as low as possible.

===Shielding===
Lead is the most common shield against X-rays because of its high density (11,340 kg/m3), stopping power, ease of installation and low cost. The maximum range of a high-energy photon such as an X-ray in matter is infinite; at every point in the matter traversed by the photon, there is a probability of interaction. Thus there is a very small probability of no interaction over very large distances. The shielding of photon beam is therefore exponential (with an attenuation length being close to the radiation length of the material); doubling the thickness of shielding will square the shielding effect.

Table in this section shows the recommended thickness of lead shielding in function of X-ray energy, from the Recommendations by the Second International Congress of Radiology.

===Campaigns===
In response to increased concern by the public over radiation doses and the ongoing progress of best practices, The Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging was formed within the Society for Pediatric Radiology. In concert with the American Society of Radiologic Technologists, the American College of Radiology, and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, the Society for Pediatric Radiology developed and launched the Image Gently campaign which is designed to maintain high quality imaging studies while using the lowest doses and best radiation safety practices available on pediatric patients. This initiative has been endorsed and applied by a growing list of various professional medical organizations around the world and has received support and assistance from companies that manufacture equipment used in radiology.

Following upon the success of the Image Gently campaign, the American College of Radiology, the Radiological Society of North America, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, and the American Society of Radiologic Technologists have launched a similar campaign to address this issue in the adult population called Image Wisely. The World Health Organization and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the United Nations have also been working in this area and have ongoing projects designed to broaden best practices and lower patient radiation dose.

===Provider payment===
Contrary to advice that emphasises only conducting radiographs when in the patient&#x27;s interest, recent evidence suggests that they are used more frequently when dentists are paid under fee-for-service.

==Equipment==


===Sources===
In medicine and dentistry, projectional radiography and computed tomography images generally use X-rays created by X-ray generators, which generate X-rays from X-ray tubes. The resultant images from the radiograph (X-ray generator/machine) or CT scanner are correctly referred to as &quot;radiograms&quot;/&quot;roentgenograms&quot; and &quot;tomograms&quot; respectively.

A number of other sources of X-ray photons are possible, and may be used in industrial radiography or research; these include betatrons, linear accelerators (linacs), and synchrotrons. For gamma rays, radioactive sources such as 192Ir, 60Co, or 137Cs are used.

===Grid===
An anti-scatter grid may be placed between the patient and the detector to reduce the quantity of scattered x-rays that reach the detector. This improves the contrast resolution of the image, but also increases radiation exposure for the patient.

===Detectors===
Detectors can be divided into two major categories: imaging detectors (such as photographic plates and X-ray film (photographic film), now mostly replaced by various digitizing devices like image plates or flat panel detectors) and dose measurement devices (such as ionization chambers, Geiger counters, and dosimeters used to measure the local radiation exposure, dose, and/or dose rate, for example, for verifying that radiation protection equipment and procedures are effective on an ongoing basis).

=== Side markers ===
A radiopaque anatomical side marker is added to each image. For example, if the patient has their right hand x-rayed, the radiographer includes a radiopaque &quot;R&quot; marker within the field of the x-ray beam as an indicator of which hand has been imaged. If a physical marker is not included, the radiographer may add the correct side marker later as part of digital post-processing.

===Image intensifiers and array detectors===

As an alternative to X-ray detectors, image intensifiers are analog devices that readily convert the acquired X-ray image into one visible on a video screen. This device is made of a vacuum tube with a wide input surface coated on the inside with caesium iodide (CsI). When hit by X-rays, phosphor material causes the photocathode adjacent to it to emit electrons. These electrons are then focused using electron lenses inside the intensifier to an output screen coated with phosphorescent materials. The image from the output can then be recorded via a camera and displayed.

Digital devices known as array detectors are becoming more common in fluoroscopy. These devices are made of discrete pixelated detectors known as thin-film transistors (TFT) which can either work &quot;indirectly&quot; by using photo detectors that detect light emitted from a scintillator material such as CsI, or &quot;directly&quot; by capturing the electrons produced when the X-rays hit the detector. Direct detectors do not tend to experience the blurring or spreading effect caused by phosphorescent scintillators or by film screens since the detectors are activated directly by X-ray photons.

==Dual-energy==
&quot;Dual-energy&quot; radiography is where images are acquired using two separate tube voltages. This is the standard method for bone densitometry. It is also used in CT pulmonary angiography to decrease the required dose of iodinated contrast.

<text>In Māori mythology, Tama-nui-te-rā (Tamanuiterā) is the personification of the sun.

== Etymology ==
In the Māori language, &quot;Tama-nui-te-rā&quot; means &quot;Great Son of the Sun&quot;. The Māori word for &quot;sun&quot; or &quot;day&quot; is &quot;rā&quot;, deriving from Proto-Polynesian *&quot;laqaa&quot;.

==Legends ==
According to the Māori mythology the sun once moved across the sky so quickly there was not enough time in the day for people to complete tasks. The demigod Māui, along with his brothers, travelled to where Tama-nui-te-rā rose from the underworld and laid ropes to catch him, then beat him to make him travel more slowly across the sky. The rays of the sun are said to be remnants of the ropes which slow the suns journey across the sky.

== Family ==
In some legends Tama-nui-te-rā is the husband of Ārohirohi, goddess of mirages. In other legends, Tama-nui-te-rā had two wives, the Summer maid, Hineraumati, and the Winter maid, Hinetakurua. During the year he would divide his time between his two wives, this marked the changing of the seasons and the changing position of the sun in the sky. In winter, the sun rising in the north-eastern sky marked Tama-nui-te-rā residence with Hinetakurua. After the winter solstice the sun&#x27;s changing position to the south-eastern sky was described as Tama-nui-te-rā returning to Hineraumati. 

The child of Tama-nui-te-rā and Hineraumati, Tane-rore, is credited with the origin of dance.

Another son of Tama-nui-te-ra is Auahitūroa, god of comets and fires, and grandchildren of Tama-nui-te-rā are Ngā Mānawa.

<doc id="95809" wikidata="Q1637332" url="?curid=95809" title="Huna (New Age)">
<text>Huna (Hawaiian for &quot;secret&quot;) is the word adopted by the New Age author Max Freedom Long (1890–1971) in 1936 to describe his theory of metaphysics. Long cited what he believed to be the spiritual practices of the ancient Hawaiian kahunas (priests) as inspiration; however, contemporary scholars consider the system to be his invention designed through a mixture of a variety of spiritual practices from various cultures, with roots in New Thought and Theosophy, rather than in traditional Hawaiian beliefs.

==History==
Max Freedom Long went to Hawaii in 1917 to work as an elementary school teacher. He became interested in the religious beliefs and practices of the ancient kahunas and modern practitioners of traditional, indigenous Hawaiian religion, but none of the ceremonial people talked to him so he was unable to penetrate to the inner workings of this religion. In the Hawaiian language, the term &quot;kahuna&quot; is used for any expert. Kahuna include experts in diagnosing illness, herbal medicine, canoe building, temple building, wood carving, star-gazing, agriculture, and others.

Long left Hawaii in 1931, convinced that he would never learn these secrets. In 1934, he woke with a revelation that the secrets were encoded into the Hawaiian language itself. He called the religious system he developed from this revelation &quot;Huna&quot; (the Hawaiian word for secret), and wrote his first book in 1936 to chronicle his beliefs.

In 1945 Long founded Huna Research. In 1953, he published &quot;The Secret Science at Work&quot; as a Huna textbook, and in 1965 &quot;The Huna Codes in Religions&quot;, examining parallels between his invented system and religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity.

==Principles and beliefs==
===Max Long===
Long believed he had discovered an ancient truth, not just about Hawaiian spirituality but linking back to India and ancient Egypt. He believed Hawaiians were a lost tribe of Berbers, and wrote that spiritual adepts migrated to Hawai‘i from Egypt, passing on to the priests of India some of their basic beliefs. Long also linked Huna to Theosophy and New Thought movements of the time, writing that Christian Scientists understood positive thinking better than any group he knew, and encouraged his readers to subscribe to Unity Church’s magazine, &quot;Daily Word&quot;.

Huna emphasizes practical living and harmony with three levels of consciousness or selves, a low, middle, and higher self, which were supposedly recognized by ancient kahunas. Long called these selves the &quot;unihipili&quot; (subconscious, inner, emotional, intuitive), &quot;uhane&quot; (waking consciousness, rational) and &quot;aumakua&quot; (super-conscious, connection with the divine). These are not the Hawaiian meanings of these words, which are traditionally defined as &quot;the spirit of a dead person&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;dirge&quot;, and &quot;family or personal gods&quot; respectively.

In addition, Long redefined the Hawaiian concept of &quot;mana&quot;, (privileged as a divine power in traditional Hawaiian belief), and presented it instead as a vitalizing life force, which can, with knowledge of the three selves, be used in a manner of &quot;personal empowerment&quot; to heal body and mind and achieve life goals.

===Later teachers===
Subsequent Huna teachers have placed the movement firmly in the New Age, with Serge King claiming that Huna came originally from aliens from the Pleiades who were remnants of the mythical advanced civilizations of Mu or Lemuria, and Pila Chiles associating the islands with the New Age versions/interpretations of chakras, vortexes and ley lines.

According to critics, Serge King misappropriated and attempted to redefine the names of three Hawaiian gods for his idea of &quot;the three selves&quot;: &quot;Ku,&quot; &quot;Lono,&quot; and &quot;Kane&quot;.

King listed seven principles of Huna, which are given in the table below. King also calls what he does &quot;shamanism&quot; and cites &quot;West African shamanism&quot; as an influence.

==Reaction==
Max Freedom Long wrote that he obtained many of his case studies and his ideas about what to look for in kahuna magic from the Director of the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, William Brigham. According to an article in the peer-reviewed &quot;Hawaiian Journal of History,&quot; there is no credible evidence that the two men met (citation requested). Even if they did, Brigham was not an expert on kahunas and did not document in his own writings any of the incidents Long ascribed to him, including walking on hot lava. In his letters and manuscripts, Brigham stated that Hawaiians were &quot;an inferior race,&quot; and implied they were lazy. He referred to Queen Liliʻuokalani as a &quot;she devil,&quot; &quot;squaw,&quot; and &quot;nigger.&quot;

Native Hawaiian scholar Charles Kenn, recognized in the Hawaiian community as a &quot;kahuna&quot; and expert in Hawaiian history and traditions, was friendly with Max Freedom Long but said, &quot;While this Huna study is an interesting study, … it is not, and never was Hawaiian.&quot;

Pali Jae Lee, a research librarian at the Bishop Museum, and author of the classic book, &quot;Tales From the Night Rainbow&quot;, conducted extensive research on Max Freedom Long and Huna. She concluded, based on her interviews with Hawaiian elders, &quot;Huna is not Hawaiian.&quot; Lee cites Theodore Kelsey, a Living Treasure of Hawai&#x27;i renowned for his work as a Hawaiian translator who wrote a letter to Long in 1936 (now in the Hawai&#x27;i State Archives) criticizing his use of the terms &quot;unihipili&quot; and &quot;aumakua.&quot;

Author Nancy Kahalewai, a teacher of lomilomi massage, wrote that &quot;traditional lomilomi practitioners do not teach this philosophy. In fact, most insist that it is not from the native Hawaiian culture at all.&quot;

Wells College Professor Lisa Kahaleole Hall, Ph.D., a Native Hawaiian, wrote in a peer-reviewed journal published by the University of Hawai&#x27;i that Huna &quot;bears absolutely no resemblance to any Hawaiian worldview or spiritual practice&quot; and calls it part of the &quot;New Age spiritual industry.&quot;

Mikael Rothstein, an associate professor of religious history at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, is the author of several books on religious history and new religious movements. He wrote about Huna in a peer-reviewed anthology:
Rather than integrating Hawaiian religion, however, New Agers seem to carry out a radical reinterpretation of this tradition, or simply invent traditions that were never Hawaiian. ... New Age representations redefine Hawaiian concepts in order to align them to basic New Age trends.

==Organizations==
Huna Research Inc was founded by Long in 1945. On his death in 1971, he was succeeded as its head by Dr. E Otha Wingo (in accordance with a request by Long), and moved its headquarters to Missouri, where Wingo was a professor. It has fellowships in Canada, Australia, England, Germany and Switzerland, in addition to the United States.

Huna International was formed as a religious order in 1973 by King. It has three branches: Aloha International, Voices of the Earth and Finding Each Other International.

<doc id="95811" wikidata="Q3629766" url="?curid=95811" title="Aumakua">
<text>In Hawaiian mythology, an ʻaumakua (; often spelled aumakua, plural, ″aumākua) is a personal or family god that originated as a deified ancestor, and which takes on physical forms such as spirit vehicles. An &#x27;aumakua may manifest as a shark, owl, bird, octopus, or inanimate objects such as plants or rocks. The word ʻaumakua means ancestor gods and is derived from the Hawaiian words au which means period of time or era, and makua meaning parent, parent generation, or ancestor. Hawaiians believed that deceased family members would transform into ʻaumakua and watch over their descendants with a loving concern for them while also being the judge and jury of their actions. 

ʻAumakua were believed to watch over their families and hear their words, give them strength and guidance, warn them of misfortune or danger, give punishments to wrong-doers while also rewarding worthy people with prosperity in the after life, and pass on prayers from the living to the akua (gods).

Hawaiian-born actor Jason Momoa has a halfsleeve tattoo on his left forearm that is a tribute to his family god, or aumakua, which is a shark. Some families had many ʻaumākua. Mary Kawena Pukui&#x27;s family had at least fifty known ʻaumākua.

== Roles of ʻAumākua ==
ʻAumakua could give warnings of coming misfortune or danger, punishments, and guidance to their respective ʻohana (families). ʻAumakua relayed these messages to family members through hōʻike a ka pō (revelation in the night, dreams), visions, or physical manifestations. Hawaiians also believed that “just the nagging feeling that something is wrong” was a message sent from their ʻaumakua.

ʻAumakua were also protectors of their families. An example of this comes from the Puna district on Hawaiʻi island which was shared with anthropologist Martha Beckwith: “...this one family… had a supernatural helper or aumakua who appeared in the form of a particular shark. When any of the family go fishing, the shark appears. The aumakua obeys the voice of man. Name the fish you want and it will bring it. This family can never be drowned. If there is a storm and the boat capsizes, the shark appears and the men ride on its back.” 

As protectors, ʻaumakua could also give mental or physical strength to ʻohana members who were in need of help but could not help themselves, primarily the keiki (children), the sick, and the elderly.

ʻAumakua could also bring punishment to families who offended or displeased them. These offenses included behavior like greed, dishonesty, and theft, breaking ʻai kapu, bathing in pools that were kapu (taboo), and eating the physical form of ones ʻaumakua. Punishments were often illnesses in the form of “diagnostic clues”, so a thief would develop a swollen hand or a sore foot would trouble a trespasser until they made restitution.

ʻAumakua also acted as judge and jury after a person&#x27;s death. They had the power to punish or reward the personʻs spirit depending on whether or not that person lived a righteous life, or even send the spirit back to the body if it left the body prematurely in “apparent deaths”. 

==Physical forms==
ʻAumākua could appear as:
* ʻalalā - crow
* manō - shark
* pueo - a species of short-eared owl
* heʻe - octopus
* mea kanu - plant
* pōhaku - rock
*mo&#x27;o - lizard
*Moa wahine - Mud hen
*Puhi - Eel
*ʻIole liʻiliʻi - Small field mice
*Peʻelua - Caterpillars
ʻAumakua were able to take on Kino lau (many bodies, many forms) which means that they could change back and forth from “invisible people&quot; (poʻe or ka pō), animals, plants, and minerals. ʻAumakua as animals could also inhabit plants that had similar characteristics or visual resemblance to that animal. For example, ʻaumakua as mackerel (ʻōpelu) were also associated with the lobelia plant (also called ʻōpleu) whose leaves are a similar shape and color as the fish.

== In popular culture ==
* The 2016 Nintendo video games &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Moon&quot;, which are set in a fictional archipelago inspired by the real-world location of Hawaii, make reference to various aspects of Hawaiian culture, including the &#x27;aumakua. Tapu Koko is called the guardian deity of Melemele Island and has a mask-like shell that looks like a stylized rooster head. 
* In the 2016 Disney animated film &quot;Moana&quot;, the concept of the &#x27;aumakua is an inspiration for Tala&#x27;s transformation into a manta ray; the Aumakua is referenced by name in pre-production artwork.
* In &quot;Ka laina ma ke one&quot; (&quot;Line in the Sand&quot;), a seventh season episode of the U.S. television series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, Kono Kalakaua mentions that her family&#x27;s aumakua is the manō, which motivates her to protect them.

<doc id="95812" wikidata="Q209625" url="?curid=95812" title="Year Without a Summer">
<text>The year 1816 is known as the Year Without a Summer because of severe climate abnormalities that caused average global temperatures to decrease by . Summer temperatures in Europe were the coldest of any on record between 1766 and 2000, resulting in crop failures and major food shortages across the Northern Hemisphere.

Evidence suggests that the anomaly was predominantly a volcanic winter event caused by the massive 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in April in modern-day Indonesia (commonly referred to as the Dutch East Indies at the time). This eruption was the largest in at least 1,300 years (after the hypothesized eruption causing the volcanic winter of 536); its effect on the climate may have been exacerbated by the 1814 eruption of Mayon in the Philippines. The significant amount of volcanic ash and gases released into the atmosphere blocked sunlight, leading to global cooling.

Countries such as Great Britain, Ireland, and France experienced significant hardship, with food riots and famine becoming common. The situation was exacerbated by the fact that Europe was still recovering from the Napoleonic Wars, adding to the socio-economic stress.

North America also faced extreme weather conditions. In the eastern United States, a persistent &quot;dry fog&quot; dimmed the sunlight, causing unusual cold and frost throughout the summer months. Crops failed in regions like New England, leading to food shortages and economic distress. These conditions forced many families to leave their homes in search of better farming opportunities, contributing to Westward expansion.

==Description==
The Year Without a Summer was an agricultural disaster; historian John D. Post called it &quot;the last great subsistence crisis in the Western world&quot;. The climatic aberrations of 1816 had their greatest effect on New England (US), Atlantic Canada, and Western Europe.

The main cause of the Year Without a Summer is generally held to be a volcanic winter created by the April 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on Sumbawa. The eruption had a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) ranking of 7, and ejected at least of dense-rock equivalent material into the atmosphere. It remains the most recent confirmed VEI-7 eruption to date.

Other large volcanic eruptions (of at least VEI-4) around this time include:

* The 1808 mystery eruption in the southwestern Pacific Ocean
* 1812, La Soufrière on Saint Vincent in the Caribbean
* 1812, Awu in the Sangihe Islands, Dutch East Indies
* 1813, Suwanosejima in the Ryukyu Islands
* 1814, Mayon in the Philippines

These eruptions had built up a substantial amount of atmospheric dust, and thus temperatures fell worldwide as the airborne material blocked sunlight in the stratosphere. According to a 2012 analysis by Berkeley Earth, the 1815 Tambora eruption caused a temporary drop in the Earth&#x27;s average land temperature of about one degree Celsius; smaller temperature drops were recorded from the 1812–1814 eruptions.

The Earth had already been in a centuries-long period of cooling that began in the 14th century. Known today as the Little Ice Age, it had already caused considerable agricultural distress in Europe. The eruption of Tambora occurred near the end of the Little Ice Age, exacerbating the background global cooling of the period.

This period also occurred during the Dalton Minimum, a period of relatively low solar activity from 1790 to 1830. May 1816 had the lowest Wolf number (0.1) to date since records on solar activity began. It is not yet known, however, if and how changes in solar activity affect Earth&#x27;s climate, and this correlation does not prove that lower solar activity produces global cooling.

=== Africa ===
No direct evidence for conditions in the Sahel region have been found, though conditions from surrounding areas have implied above-normal rainfall. Below the Sahel, the coastal regions of West Africa likely experienced below-normal levels of precipitation. Severe storms affected the South African coast during the Southern Hemisphere winter. On July 29–30, 1816, a violent storm occurred near Cape Town, South Africa, which brought forceful northerly winds and hail and caused severe damage to shipping.

===Asia===
The monsoon season in China was disrupted, resulting in overwhelming floods in the Yangtze Valley. Fort Shuangcheng reported fields disrupted by frost and conscripts deserting as a result. Summer snowfall or otherwise mixed precipitation was reported in various locations in Jiangxi and Anhui. In Taiwan, snow was reported in Hsinchu and Miaoli, and frost was reported in Changhua. A large-scale famine in Yunnan helped reverse the fortunes of the ruling Qing dynasty.

In India, the delayed summer monsoon caused late torrential rains that aggravated the spread of cholera from a region near the Ganges in Bengal to as far as Moscow. In Bengal, abnormal cold and snow was reported in the winter monsoon.

In Japan, which was still cautious after the cold-weather-related Great Tenmei famine of 1782–1788, cold damaged crops, but no crop failures were reported and there was no adverse effect on population.
===Europe===
As a result of the series of volcanic eruptions in the 1810s, crops had been poor for several years; the final blow came in 1815 with the eruption of Tambora. Europe, still recuperating from the Napoleonic Wars, suffered from widespread food shortages, resulting in its worst famine of the century. Low temperatures and heavy rains resulted in failed harvests in Great Britain and Ireland. Famine was prevalent in north and southwest Ireland, following the failure of wheat, oat, and potato harvests. Food prices rose sharply throughout Europe. With the cause of the problems unknown, hungry people demonstrated in front of grain markets and bakeries. Food riots took place in many European cities. Though riots were common during times of hunger, the food riots of 1816 and 1817 were the most violent period on the continent since the French Revolution.

Between 1816 and 1819, major typhus epidemics occurred in parts of Europe, including Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, and Scotland, precipitated by the famine. More than 65,000 people died as the disease spread out of Ireland.

The long-running Central England temperature record reported the eleventh coldest year on record since 1659, as well as the third coldest summer and the coldest July on record. Widespread flooding of Europe&#x27;s major rivers is attributed to the event, as is frost in August. Hungary experienced snowfall colored brown by volcanic ash; in northern Italy, red snow fell throughout the year.

In western Switzerland, the summers of 1816 and 1817 were so cold that an ice dam formed below a tongue of the Giétro Glacier in the Val de Bagnes, creating a lake. Despite engineer Ignaz Venetz&#x27;s efforts to drain the growing lake, the ice dam collapsed catastrophically in June 1818, killing forty people in the resulting flood.

===North America===
In the spring and summer of 1816, a persistent &quot;dry fog&quot; was observed in parts of the eastern United States. The fog reddened and dimmed sunlight such that sunspots were visible to the naked eye. Neither wind nor rainfall dispersed the &quot;fog&quot;, retrospectively characterized by Clive Oppenheimer as a &quot;stratospheric sulfate aerosol veil&quot;.

The weather was not in itself a hardship for those accustomed to long winters. Hardship came from the weather&#x27;s effect on crops and thus on the supply of food and firewood. The consequences were felt most strongly at higher elevations, where farming was already difficult even in good years. In May 1816, frost killed off most crops in the higher elevations of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and upstate New York. On June 6, snow fell in Albany, New York, and Dennysville, Maine. In Cape May, New Jersey, frost was reported five nights in a row in late June, causing extensive crop damage. Though fruit and vegetable crops survived in New England, corn was reported to have ripened so poorly that no more than a quarter of it was usable for food, and much of it was moldy and not even fit for animal feed. The crop failures in New England, Canada, and parts of Europe caused food prices to rise sharply. In Canada, Quebec ran out of bread and milk, and Nova Scotians found themselves boiling foraged herbs for sustenance.

Sarah Snell Bryant, of Cummington, Massachusetts, wrote in her diary: &quot;Weather backward.&quot; At the Church Family of Shakers near New Lebanon, New York, Nicholas Bennet wrote in May 1816 that &quot;all was froze&quot; and the hills were &quot;barren like winter&quot;. Temperatures fell below freezing almost every day in May. The ground froze on June 9; on June 12, the Shakers had to replant crops destroyed by the cold. On July 7, it was so cold that all of their crops had stopped growing. Salem, Massachusetts physician Edward Holyoke—a weather observer and amateur astronomer—while in Franconia, New Hampshire, wrote on June 7, &quot;exceedingly cold. Ground frozen hard, and squalls of snow through the day. Icicles 12 inches long in the shade of noon day.&quot; After a lull, by August 17, Holyoke noted an abrupt change from summer to winter by August 21, when a meager bean and corn crop were killed. &quot;The fields,&quot; he wrote, &quot;were as empty and white as October.&quot; The Berkshires saw frost again on August 23, as did much of New England and upstate New York.

Massachusetts historian William G. Atkins summed up the disaster:

Severe frosts occurred every month; June 7th and 8th snow fell, and it was so cold that crops were cut down, even freezing the roots ... In the early Autumn when corn was in the milk [the endosperm inside the kernel was still liquid] it was so thoroughly frozen that it never ripened and was scarcely worth harvesting. Breadstuffs were scarce and prices high and the poorer class of people were often in straits for want of food. It must be remembered that the granaries of the great west had not then been opened to us by railroad communication, and people were obliged to rely upon their own resources or upon others in their immediate locality.

In July and August, lake and river ice was observed as far south as northwestern Pennsylvania. Frost was reported in Virginia on August 20 and 21. Rapid, dramatic temperature swings were common, with temperatures sometimes reverting from normal or above-normal summer temperatures as high as to near-freezing within hours. Thomas Jefferson, by then retired from politics to his estate at Monticello in Virginia, sustained crop failures that sent him further into debt. On September 13, a Virginia newspaper reported that corn crops would be one half to two-thirds short and lamented that &quot;the cold as well as the drought has nipt the buds of hope&quot;. A Norfolk, Virginia, newspaper reported:

It is now the middle of July, and we have not yet had what could properly be called summer. Easterly winds have prevailed for nearly three months past ... the sun during that time has generally been obscured and the sky overcast with clouds; the air has been damp and uncomfortable, and frequently so chilling as to render the fireside a desirable retreat.

Regional farmers succeeded in bringing some crops to maturity, but corn and other grain prices rose dramatically. The price of oats, for example, rose from 12¢ per bushel in 1815 to 92¢ per bushel in 1816. Crop failures were aggravated by inadequate transportation infrastructure; with few roads or navigable inland waterways and no railroads, it was prohibitively expensive to import food in most of the country.

Maryland experienced brown, bluish, and yellow snowfall in April and May, colored by volcanic ash in the atmosphere.

=== South America ===
A newspaper account of northeastern Brazil was published in the United Kingdom:By an arrival at Liverpool we have received accounts from Pernambuco of the 8th of Feb. [1817], which state that a most uncommon drought has been experienced in the tropical regions of the Brazils, or that part of the country between Pernambuco and Rio Janiero. By this circumstance all the streams had been dried up, the cattle were dying or dead, and all the population emigrating to the borders of the great rivers in search of water. The greatest distress prevailed, provisions were wanting, and the mills completely at a stand. They have no windmills, so that no corn could be ground. Vessels have been sent from Pernambuco to the United States to fetch flour, and what had tended to increase this distress was the interruption of the coasting trade through the dread of war with Buenos Ayres. 

==Societal effects==
High levels of tephra in the atmosphere caused a haze to hang over the sky for several years after the eruption, and created rich red hues in sunsets. Paintings during the years before and after seem to confirm that these striking reds were not present before Mount Tambora&#x27;s eruption, and depict moodier, darker scenes, even in the light of both the sun and the moon. Caspar David Friedrich&#x27;s &quot;The Monk by the Sea&quot; (ca. 1808–1810) and &quot;Two Men by the Sea&quot; (1817) indicate this shift of mood.

A 2007 study analyzing paintings created between the years 1500 and 1900 around the times of notable volcanic events found a correlation between volcanic activity and the amount of red used in the painting. High levels of tephra in the atmosphere led to spectacular sunsets during this period, as depicted in the paintings of J. M. W. Turner, and may have given rise to the yellow tinge predominant in his paintings such as &quot;Chichester Canal&quot; (1828). Similar phenomena were observed after the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, and on the West Coast of the United States following the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo.

The lack of oats to feed horses may have inspired the German inventor Karl Drais to research new ways of horseless transportation, which led to the invention of the draisine and velocipede, a precursor of the bicycle.

The crop failures of the &quot;Year without a Summer&quot; may have shaped the settlement of the Midwestern United States, as many thousands of people left New England for western New York and the Northwest Territory in search of a more hospitable climate, richer soil, and better growing conditions. Indiana became a state in December 1816, and Illinois did two years later. British historian Lawrence Goldman has suggested that migration into the burned-over district of upstate New York was responsible for centering the abolitionist movement in that region.

According to historian L. D. Stillwell, Vermont alone experienced a decrease in population of between 10,000 and 15,000 in 1816 and 1817, erasing seven previous years of population growth. Among those who left Vermont were the family of Joseph Smith, who moved from Norwich, Vermont, to Palmyra, New York. This move precipitated the series of events that culminated in Smith founding the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In June 1816, &quot;incessant rainfall&quot; during the &quot;wet, ungenial summer&quot; forced Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and their friends to stay indoors at Villa Diodati for much of their Swiss holiday. Inspired by a collection of German ghost stories that they had read, Lord Byron proposed a contest to see who could write the scariest story, leading Shelley to write &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and Lord Byron to write &quot;A Fragment&quot;, which Polidori later used as inspiration for &quot;The Vampyre&quot; – a precursor to &quot;Dracula&quot;. These days inside Villa Diodati, remembered fondly by Mary Shelley, were occupied by opium use and intellectual conversations. After listening intently to one of these conversations, she awoke with the image of Victor Frankenstein kneeling over his monstrous creation, and thus was inspired to write &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Lord Byron was inspired to write the poem &quot;Darkness&quot; by a single day when &quot;the fowls all went to roost at noon and candles had to be lit as at midnight&quot;. The imagery in the poem is starkly similar to the conditions of the Year Without a Summer:

Justus von Liebig, a chemist who had experienced the famine as a child in Darmstadt, later studied plant nutrition and introduced mineral fertilizers.

* An eruption of Laki, in Iceland, was responsible for up to hundreds of thousands of fatalities throughout the Northern Hemisphere (over 25,000 in England alone), and one of the coldest winters ever recorded in North America, 1783–1784; long-term consequences included poverty and famine that may have contributed to the French Revolution in 1789.
* The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa caused average Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures to fall by as much as 1.2 °C (2.2 °F). One of the wettest rainy seasons in recorded history followed in California during 1883–1884.
* The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to odd weather patterns and temporary cooling in the United States, particularly in the Midwest and parts of the Northeast. Every month in 1992 except for January and February was colder than normal. More rain than normal fell across the West Coast of the United States, particularly California, during the 1991–1992 and 1992–1993 rainy seasons. The American Midwest experienced more rain and major flooding during the spring and summer of 1993. This may also have contributed to the historic &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; on the Atlantic Coast in March that same year.

<text>Camden Town () is an area in the London Borough of Camden, around north-northwest of Charing Cross. Historically in Middlesex, it is identified in the London Plan as one of 34 major centres in Greater London.

Laid out as a residential district from 1791 and originally part of the manor of Kentish Town, Camden Town became an important location during the early development of the railways, which reinforced its position on the London canal network. The area&#x27;s industrial economic base has been replaced by service industries such as retail, tourism and entertainment. The area now hosts street markets and music venues associated with alternative culture.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Camden Town is named after Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden. His earldom was styled after his estate, Camden Place near Chislehurst in Kent (now in the London Borough of Bromley), formerly owned by historian William Camden. The name, which appears on the Ordnance Survey map of 1822, was later applied to the early-20th-century Camden Town Group of artists and the London Borough of Camden, created in 1965.

===Urban development===
The emergence of the industrial revolution in the 19th century meant Camden was the  North Western Railway&#x27;s terminal stop in 1837. It was where goods were transported off the tracks and onto the roads of London by 250 000 workhorses. The whole area was adapted to a transportation function: the Roundhouse (1846), Camden Lock and the Stables were examples of this.

Camden Town stands on land that was once the manor of Kentish Town. Sir Charles Pratt, a radical 18th-century lawyer and politician, acquired the manor through marriage. In 1791, he started granting leases for houses to be built in the manor. In 1816, the Regent&#x27;s Canal was built through the area. Up to at least the mid-20th century, Camden Town was considered an &quot;unfashionable&quot; locality. The Camden Markets, which started in 1973 and have grown since then, attract many visitors. A 1993 bomb blast injured 18 people on Camden High Street. On 9 February 2008, Camden Canal market suffered a major fire, but there were no injuries. It later reopened as Camden Lock Village, until closed in 2015 for redevelopment.

==Governance==
Camden Town was contained within the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras between 1900 and 1965, when it became part of the new London Borough of Camden, of which it is the namesake and administrative centre.

===Political constituencies===

Camden Town is contained in the following political constituencies for different purposes, listed with some incumbents :
*Camden London Borough Council: London Borough of Camden. 55 councillors, Labour control
**The Camden Town ward, created in 2020, returns two borough councillors.
*UK Parliament: Holborn and St Pancras. Keir Starmer, Labour Party
*London Assembly: Barnet and Camden. Anne Clarke, Labour Party

==Geography==
Camden Town is on relatively flat ground at above sea level, north-northwest of Charing Cross. The area of Camden Town Ward proper (ward code E05013655) is 60.30ha. To the north are the hills of Hampstead and Highgate; to the west is Primrose Hill. The culverted, subterranean River Fleet flows from its source on Hampstead Heath through Camden Town south to the River Thames. The Regent&#x27;s Canal runs through the north of Camden Town.

==Economy==

At the end of the 20th century, entertainment-related businesses began moving into the area, and a Holiday Inn was built abutting the canal. A number of retail and food chain outlets replaced independent shops, driven out by high rents and redevelopment. Restaurants with a variety of culinary traditions thrived, many of them near the markets, on Camden High Street and its side streets, Parkway, Chalk Farm Road, and Bayham Street. The plan to redevelop the historic Stables Market led to a steel and glass extension, built on the edges of the site in 2006, and increased the market&#x27;s capacity. The Dr. Martens&#x27; boot company global head office, including the design team, moved to Camden Town in 2017.

===Camden street markets===

Camden is well known for its markets. These date from 1974 or later, except for Inverness Street market, for over a century a small food market serving the local community, though by 2013 all foodstuff and produce stalls had gone and only touristy stalls remained. Camden Lock Market proper started in a former timber yard in 1973, and is now surrounded by five more markets: Buck Street market, Stables market, Camden Lock Village, and an indoor market in the Electric Ballroom. The markets are a major tourist attraction at weekends, selling goods of all types, including fashion, lifestyle, books, food, junk/antiques and more bizarre items; they and the surrounding shops are popular with young people, in particular, those searching for &quot;alternative&quot; clothing. While originally open on Sundays only, market activity later extended throughout the week, though concentrating on weekends.

==Transport==
===London Underground===
Camden Town tube station is near the markets and other attractions. and tube stations are also within walking distance. This station is a key interchange station for the Northern line, both northbound (towards Edgware or High Barnet/Mill Hill East) and southbound (via Bank or Charing Cross).

When the station was designed in 1907 the line, and the station, had to pass exactly below the narrow streets to avoid having to pay landowners for access. The platforms of the station are consequently very narrow, and the station has one platform directly above another. There is an air raid shelter under the station used during the Second World War; many stations were used air raid shelters, but few had dedicated shelters.

After the area increased in popularity with the introduction of the markets the narrow platforms became dangerously overcrowded, particularly on Sunday afternoons. London Underground made many proposals to upgrade the station. In 2004 a proposal requiring the compulsory purchase and demolition of &#x27;the Triangle&#x27;—land bordered by Kentish Town Road, Buck Street and Camden High Street—was rejected by Camden Council after opposition from local people; of 229 letters, only two supported the scheme. It was later planned to redevelop the station entirely between 2020 and 2024/5, with less demolition than proposed previously, but the redevelopment was postponed in December 2018 by TfL &quot;until we have the funds we need&quot;; no work had been announced .

Early in the 21st century the station closed to outbound passengers on Sunday afternoons due to the danger due to overcrowding of the narrow platforms during busy market hours. Mornington Crescent, Chalk Farm, and Kentish Town stations, within walking distance, remained open. The restriction was extended temporarily due to escalator renovation, and removed due to reduced traffic during the peak of the covid pandemic from 2020, but the Sunday afternoon closure continues, and outbound access is via a long spiral staircase instead of an escalator at other busy times when many market visitors arrive.

===Rail===
 is a London Overground station at the corner of Royal College Street and Camden Road, on the Mildmay line. The nearest National Rail station is station on the Thameslink route on the Midland Main Line. St Pancras International, Euston, and King&#x27;s Cross terminals are within 20 minutes&#x27; walk of Camden Town.

===Bus routes===
The area is a major hub for London Buses. The following routes serve Camden Town: 24 (24 hour), 27, 29, 31, 46, 88 (24 hour), 134 (24 hour), 168, 214 (24 hour), 253, 274 and Night Bus Routes N5, N20, N27, N28, N29, N31, N253 and N279.

===Roads===

Parts of the A503 (Camden Road) and A400 (Camden High Street and Camden Street) are designated as red routes on which vehicles may not stop for any reason, managed by Transport for London (TfL) rather than the borough. Black taxis ply for hire in the area and there are minicab offices.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, from about March 2020 roadworks were carried out to make many side roads more suitable for cycling and reduce vehicle traffic. This led to traffic jams described as &quot;gridlock&quot;, and opposition.

=== Cycling ===
Transport for London and Camden Council both provide and maintain cycling infrastructure in Camden Town. Segregated cycle tracks run alongside Royal College Street to the east of Camden Town, past Camden Road railway station. Cycling provision changes from time to time—in particular, cycling provisions were added during the COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020. Current provision information (open and proposed cycle routes, Santander Cycles docking stations) is on the TfL Web site. The CycleStreets mobile app finds suitable routes throughout the UK, including Camden Town.

The Regent&#x27;s Canal towpath is a shared-use pedestrian and cycle path maintained by the Canal and River Trust. The towpath links Camden Town to Angel and King&#x27;s Cross to the east, and Regent&#x27;s Park and Maida Vale in the west.

The London-wide Santander Cycles cycle hire scheme operates in Camden Town. There are several docking stations, some near rail and Tube stations.

Cycle counters on Royal College Street to the north of Camden Road railway station recorded over 375,000 journeys between August 2017 and July 2018.

===Regent&#x27;s Canal===


Regent&#x27;s Canal runs through the north end of Camden Town. Canal boat trips along the canal from Camden Lock are popular, particularly in summer. Many of the handrails by the bridges show deep marks worn by the towropes by which horses pulled canal barges until the 1950s, and it is still possible to see ramps on the canal bank designed to assist horses that fell in the canal after being startled by the noise of a train. Camden Lock is a regularly used traditional manually operated double canal lock operating between widely separated levels. A large complex of weekend street markets operates around the Lock. The towpath is a pedestrian and cycle route which runs continuously from Little Venice through Camden Lock to the Islington Tunnel. A regular waterbus service operates along the Regent&#x27;s Canal from Camden Lock. Boats depart every hour during the summer, heading westward around Regent&#x27;s Park, calling at London Zoo and on towards Maida Vale. Sightseeing narrow-boat trips run from Camden Lock to Little Venice.

<text>Arlington is a city in Tarrant County, Texas, United States. It is part of the Mid-Cities region of the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan statistical area, and is a principal city of the metropolis and region. The city had a population of 394,266 in 2020, making it the second-largest city in the county after Fort Worth and the third-largest city in the metropolitan area, after Dallas and Fort Worth. Arlington is the 50th-most populous city in the United States, the seventh-most populous city in the state of Texas, and the largest city in the state that is not a county seat.

Arlington is home to the University of Texas at Arlington, a major urban research university, the Arlington Assembly plant used by General Motors, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region IV, Texas Health Resources, Mensa International, and D. R. Horton. Additionally, Arlington hosts the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Field, the Dallas Cowboys at AT&amp;T Stadium, the Arlington Renegades at Choctaw Stadium, the Dallas Wings at College Park Center, the International Bowling Campus (which houses the United States Bowling Congress, International Bowling Museum and the International Bowling Hall of Fame), and the theme parks Six Flags Over Texas (the original Six Flags) and Hurricane Harbor.

==History==

European settlement in the Arlington area dates back at least to the 1840s. After the May 24, 1841 battle between Texas General Edward H. Tarrant and Native Americans of the Village Creek settlement, a trading post was established at Marrow Bone Spring in present-day Arlington (historical marker at ). The rich soil of the area attracted farmers, and several agriculture-related businesses were well established by the late nineteenth century.

Arlington was founded in 1876 along the Texas and Pacific Railway. Named after General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Arlington House in Arlington County, Virginia., Arlington grew as a cotton-ginning and farming center, and incorporated on April 21, 1884. The city could boast of water, electricity, natural gas, and telephone services by 1910, along with a non-federal public school system.

From 1892 until 1951, a mineral well drilled exactly in the middle of downtown Arlington, Texas, was a key reason to visit the town. The water was part of the city&#x27;s brand, also serving as a meeting point for everything from prohibition to the right of women to vote. The well has been paved over.

In the 1920s and 1930s, life in Arlington was bustling with controversy and entertainment. In the early 1920s, a tea room known as &quot;Top O&#x27; Hill Terrace&quot; opened up along the now-defunct Bankhead Highway to serve dinner and tea to guests traveling through Dallas and Fort Worth. Ownership changed in the late 1920s and shortly thereafter the facilities were secretly converted into casinos and a speakeasy. Known by historians as &quot;Vegas before Vegas&quot;, escape tunnels and secret rooms were constructed to hide the illegal gambling during police raids. However, the restaurant portion of the facility still existed as a legitimate business and a front.

By 1925 the city&#x27;s population was estimated at 3,031—well under the population of Dallas and Fort Worth at the time. In 1929, a horse-racing track called Arlington Downs was constructed by W.T. Waggoner and Brian Nyantika close by to the speakeasy. Gambling was still illegal, but people were making bets regardless. Waggoner and his sons campaigned to make parimutuel betting legal, and in 1933 the state issued its first legal gambling permit to Arlington Downs. The track was immensely profitable at that point, making a daily average of $113,000 before inflation with a daily attendance average of 6,700 people. At the end of the 1937 season, the state legislature repealed their parimutuel gambling laws, and the Downs were sold to commercial developers.

In the 1940s, the Arlington Downs was used as a rodeo and event venue. Top O&#x27; Hill Terrace evaded the police until 1947, when famous Texas Ranger M. T. &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; Gonzaullas caught the gambling operation in full-swing and had the place shut down. The 1940s brought World War II to the forefront of the United States, and many families from around Texas moved to Arlington to find jobs. Before World War II, the city&#x27;s population had grown to over 4,000. The war kick-started a manufacturing revolution in Texas. Arlington was between the biggest aerospace engineering hubs in Texas at the time, Dallas and Fort Worth.

In 1956, the Top O&#x27; Hill Terrace property was purchased by the Bible Baptist Seminary and converted into what is now Arlington Baptist University. The underground tunnels and original structures are still standing. In 1958, the Arlington Downs was completely destroyed by commercial developers. All that is left is an original concrete water trough and a Texas historical landmark marker placed in 2016. Large-scale industrialization began in 1954 with the arrival of a General Motors assembly plant. Automotive and aerospace development gave the city one of the nation&#x27;s greatest population growth rates between 1950 and 1990.

Arlington became one of the &quot;boomburbs&quot;, the extremely fast-growing suburbs of the post-World War II era. U.S. Census Bureau population figures for the city date the population boom: 7,692 (1950), 90,229 (1970), 261,721 (1990), 365,438 (2010) and almost 374,000 by 2011. Tom Vandergriff served as mayor from 1951 to 1977 during this period of robust economic development. Six Flags Over Texas opened in Arlington in 1961. In 1972 the Washington Senators baseball team relocated to Arlington and began play as the Texas Rangers and in 2009 the Dallas Cowboys also began to play at the newly constructed Cowboys Stadium, now AT&amp;T Stadium.

On January 13, 1996, a 9-year-old girl, Amber Hagerman, was abducted in Arlington and found murdered four days later. No one has been arrested or convicted for her murder as of 2024. The case led to the creation of the Amber Alert system.

In October 2019, Arlington was chosen out of several major U.S. cities to become the permanent home of the $150 million National Medal of Honor Museum. Construction of the museum is set to be completed in 2024.

===Professional sports===
Arlington has long been the home of the Texas Rangers baseball team, who made Arlington Stadium their first home upon moving to Dallas/Fort Worth from Washington, D.C., in 1972. In 1994, the Rangers built a new stadium, The Ballpark in Arlington (renamed Choctaw Stadium in 2021). The Rangers made trips to the 2010 World Series, 2011 World Series, and 2023 World Series, winning in 2023 against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2016, residents voted to construct a new stadium and by 2017, construction began on the $1.1 billion Globe Life Field across the street from Choctaw Stadium. Globe Life Field serves as the new home of the Texas Rangers; however, the debut of the park was delayed by the postponement of the 2020 season. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Arlington became the first city since 1944 to hold every World Series game in a single venue at Globe Life Field. In October 2023, the Rangers defeated the Houston Astros in the American League Championship Series, and won the 2023 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks.

The Dallas Cowboys football team moved from Texas Stadium in Irving in 2009 to the $1.3 billion AT&amp;T Stadium, which is within walking distance of the Rangers Ballpark. Completed in 2009, it has attracted high-profile sporting events to Arlington, including the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, Super Bowl XLV in 2011, the 2013 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Basketball South Regional Championships, and the 2014 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Basketball Final Four; the stadium was also the site of the first College Football Championship Game in January 2015 (covering the 2014 season). The Dallas Cowboys rent AT&amp;T Stadium from the City of Arlington for $167,500 per month over a thirty-year period, a sum far less than market value; in exchange, the Cowboys have complete control over the facility&#x27;s calendar and the revenues collected therefrom, including naming rights, billboard advertising, concession sales and most of the surrounding parking.

The Dallas Wings became the first Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) franchise in North Texas in 2015. They were known as the Tulsa Shock while based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but reinvented their brand after relocating to North Texas. The Wings play home games at the College Park Center in Arlington.

The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA or UT Arlington) is one of the largest universities in Texas. The university has over 40,000 students and is a valuable asset to the city of Arlington and its economy. Buildings within the academic core of the UT Arlington campus are among the oldest structures in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, including Preston Hall, Ransom Hall, College Hall, and the original Arlington High School.

The Southeast Campus of Tarrant County College is located in Arlington.

====Private institutions====
Arlington Baptist University (ABU) is a private 4-year Bible college affiliated with the World Baptist Fellowship that offers undergraduate and graduate degrees. ABU traces its founding to J. Frank Norris, the controversial Independent Baptist minister.

A branch of University of Phoenix is located in Arlington, as well as the flagship campus of Ogle School, a cosmetology school.

===Primary and secondary schools===
Arlington&#x27;s residents live in five independent school districts (or ISDs): Arlington ISD, Mansfield ISD, Hurst-Euless-Bedford ISD, Kennedale ISD, and Fort Worth ISD. In Texas, school district boundaries do not always follow city and county boundaries because all aspects of school district government apparatus, including district boundaries, are separated from city and county governments. Not all city of Arlington residents is in the AISD, and not all AISD students are residents of Arlington.

There are currently ten AISD high schools.

Arlington has dozens of private and public charter schools not affiliated with any ISDs.

==Transportation==


On July 2, 1902, the first Dallas/Fort-Worth &quot;Interurban&quot; electric trolley came to Arlington; this popular service ran between those three cities and points in between until Christmas Eve, 1934, providing easy transportation for both business and pleasure. The track ran through Arlington along what is now Abram Street.

In the era of private operation of passenger trains prior to the Amtrak era, Texas and Pacific Railway trains such as the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; and the &quot;Louisiana Eagle&quot; made stops in Arlington, on trips between Fort Worth and Dallas. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; (Chicago-San Antonio) makes stops at Fort Worth Central Station 14 miles to the west and Dallas Union Station 18 miles to the east.

Arlington Municipal Airport (GKY) is located entirely within Arlington and is a public use airport owned by the City of Arlington. It serves as a reliever airport for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Dallas Love Field. Several companies operate aircraft services on the airport property, including the Bell Helicopter division of Textron.

For many years, Arlington had the distinction of being the largest city in the United States that was not served by a public transportation system. Between 1980 and 2013, voters rejected three separate ballot proposals to bring public transportation to the city, though certain political and economic realities particular to North Texas made successful passage of those measures arguably more difficult in Arlington than in other parts of the state or country. On August 19, 2013, the two-year pilot project known as the Metro Arlington Xpress (MAX) bus began offering weekday bus service between College Park Center (on the campus of The University of Texas at Arlington) and the Trinity Railway Express (TRE) CentrePort Station near DFW Airport, with a single stop near the Arlington Entertainment District. From the TRE station, riders could take the TRE to Fort Worth, Dallas and points in between, all of which are served by comprehensive public transit systems.

On its first year, the MAX program logged 64,600 one-way rides and cost $1.4 million. The service was run through a tri-party agreement between the City of Arlington, the Fort Worth Transportation Authority and the Dallas Area Rapid Transit. City Council extended the MAX bus service beyond the original two-year pilot timeframe through annual contracts until December 31, 2017. The MAX was officially shut down on December 29, 2017, a few weeks after Via debuted in Arlington. The City of Arlington has a lower than average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, just 4.7 percent of Arlington households lacked a car, which dropped to 3.7 percent in 2016. The national average is 8.7 percent in 2016. Arlington averaged 1.89 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.

In January 2017, Arlington was part of a Texas state-wide designation as an Automated Vehicle Proving Ground by the U.S. Department of Transportation. In August 2017, Arlington launched the first autonomous vehicle shuttle service in the United States offered by a municipal government to the general public on a continuous basis. Named Milo, the autonomous electric shuttles provide service during major events at Globe Life Park and AT&amp;T Stadium, connecting remote parking areas to the stadiums.

Arlington also offers Via Arlington, a public, on-demand, shared transportation service in partnership with the TransitTech company Via, which began in December 2017. Riders can request a pickup from a six-passenger van within a designated service area, which covers key destinations within Arlington as well as connecting to the Trinity Railway Express CentrePort Station. Beginning January 19, 2021, this service was expanded citywide. Arlington also partners with Via and autonomous vehicles provider May Mobility to operate Arlington RAPID, which provides on-demand autonomous vehicle rides in Downtown Arlington and on the University of Texas at Arlington&#x27;s campus and is one of the first services of its kind in the United States.

Additionally, Arlington has four transit services targeting individual demographic groups: &quot;Handitran&quot; serves senior citizens and disabled people; Arlington hotels pay for a tourist-oriented shuttle-bus system for their guests; The University of Texas at Arlington runs a limited shuttle service for college students; and lastly Mission Arlington, an Arlington-run charity serving the severely indigent, has a bus service that circulates people needing social services or transportation to employment.

The city is served by two Interstate Highways, I-20, also known as Ronald Reagan Memorial Highway, and I-30, also named Tom Landry Memorial Highway. Other limited-access freeways include State Highway 360, which is named for the founder of Six Flags Over Texas, Angus G. Wynne, running along the eastern border, and U.S. Highway 287, which traverses the southwestern portion of the city. In most cases, the memorial names are not used in reference to these roadways. The city also has a tollway, The 360 Tollway, which connects Mansfield to Arlington and Grand Prairie. The tollway is also known as the Rosa Parks Memorial Parkway, named after the civil rights activist. Near US-287, where the tollway ends, the tollway is also named &quot;Senator Chris Harris Memorial Highway&quot; after the local legislator who aided the extension.

The Union Pacific Railroad now owns and operates the original Texas and Pacific (later Missouri Pacific) transcontinental right-of-way and rail route through Arlington (parallel to which the Interurban originally ran); it offers no passenger stops in Arlington, its Arlington freight service is primarily to the local General Motors assembly plant, and most of its lengthy and numerous freight trains are merely passing through town to and from points far away.

<text>Direct democracy or pure democracy is a form of democracy in which the electorate directly decides on policy initiatives, without elected representatives as proxies, as opposed to the representative democracy model which occurs in the majority of established democracies. The theory and practice of direct democracy and participation as its common characteristic constituted the core of the work of many theorists, philosophers, politicians, and social critics, among whom the most important are Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Stuart Mill, and G.D.H. Cole.

==Overview==
In direct democracy the people decide on policies without any intermediary or representative, whereas in a representative democracy people vote for representatives who then enact policy initiatives. Depending on the particular system in use, direct democracy might entail passing executive decisions, the use of sortition, making laws, directly electing or dismissing officials, and conducting trials. Two leading forms of direct democracy are participatory democracy and deliberative democracy. Semi-direct democracies, in which representatives administer day-to-day governance, but the citizens remain the sovereign, allow for three forms of popular action: referendum (plebiscite), initiative, and recall. The first two forms—referendums and initiatives—are examples of direct legislation. , thirty countries allowed for referendums initiated by the population on the national level.

A compulsory referendum subjects the legislation drafted by political elites to a binding popular vote. This is the most common form of direct legislation. A popular referendum empowers citizens to make a petition that calls existing legislation to a vote by the citizens. Institutions specify the timeframe for a valid petition and the number of signatures required and may require signatures from diverse communities to protect minority interests. This form of direct democracy effectively grants the voting public a veto on laws adopted by the elected legislature, as in Switzerland.

A citizen-initiated referendum, also called an initiative, empowers members of the general public to propose, by petition, specific statutory measures or constitutional reforms to the government and, as with other referendums, the vote may be binding or simply advisory. Initiatives may be direct or indirect: with the direct initiative, a successful proposition is placed directly on the ballot to be subject to vote (as exemplified by California&#x27;s system). With an indirect initiative, a successful proposition is first presented to the legislature for their consideration; however, if no acceptable action is taken after a designated period of time, the proposition moves to direct popular vote. Constitutional amendments in Switzerland, Liechtenstein or Uruguay goes through such a form of indirect initiative.

A deliberative referendum is a referendum that increases public deliberation through purposeful institutional design. Power of recall gives the public the power to remove elected officials from office before the end of their designated standard term of office.

Mandatory referendums correspond to majority rule while optional referendums and popular initiatives correspond to consensus democracy (e.g. Switzerland).

Popular assemblies are another form of direct democracy, consisting of an assembly open to everyone within a local area or entity. Their roles and functioning have varied throughout time. Athenian democracy featured one such assembly as its highest decision-making body. A few places have long traditions of making decisions through an open assembly, such as the &quot;Landsgemeinden&quot; of Switzerland and town meetings of New England. They have arisen in times of revolutionary turmoil as well as more recent initiatives such as participatory budgeting. They are not generally seen as viable above a local level, as it is impossible to gather all the citizens of a modern state into an assembly.

While local governments often hold consultative meetings in modern times, they do not typically have binding power. Graham Smith argues:
==History==
=== Antiquity ===
One strand of thought sees direct democracy as common and widespread in pre-state societies.

The earliest well-documented direct democracy is said to be the Athenian democracy of the 5th century BC. The main bodies in the Athenian democracy were the assembly, composed of male citizens; the boulê, composed of 500 citizens; and the law courts, composed of a massive number of jurors chosen by lot, with no judges. Ancient Attica had only about 30,000 male citizens, but several thousand of them were politically active in each year and many of them quite regularly for years on end. The Athenian democracy was &quot;direct&quot; not only in the sense that the assembled people made decisions, but also in the sense that the people – through the assembly, boulê, and law courts – controlled the entire political process, and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in public affairs. Most modern democracies, being representative, not direct, do not resemble the Athenian system. Moreover, the Athenian democracy was exclusive. For example, in Athens in the middle of the 4th century there were about 100,000 citizens (Athenian citizenship was limited to men and women whose parents had also been Athenian citizens), about 10,000 metoikoi, or “resident foreigners,” and 150,000 slaves. Out of all those people, only male citizens who were older than 18 were a part of the demos, meaning only about 40,000 people could participate in the democratic process.

Also relevant to the history of direct democracy is the history of Ancient Rome, specifically during the Roman Republic, traditionally founded around 509 BC. Rome displayed many aspects of democracy, both direct and indirect, from the era of Roman monarchy all the way to the collapse of the Roman Empire. While the Roman senate was the main body with historical longevity, lasting from the Roman kingdom until after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, it did not embody a purely democratic approach, being made up – during the late republic – of former elected officials, providing advice rather than creating law. The democratic aspect of the constitution resided in the Roman popular assemblies, where the people organized into &quot;centuriae&quot; or into tribes – depending on the assembly – and cast votes on various matters, including elections and laws, proposed before them by their elected magistrates. Some classicists have argued that the Roman republic deserves the label of &quot;democracy&quot;, with universal suffrage for adult male citizens, popular sovereignty, and transparent deliberation of public affairs.
Many historians mark the end of the Republic with the &quot;lex Titia&quot;, passed on 27 November 43 BC, which eliminated many oversight provisions.

=== Modern era ===

Modern-era citizen-lawmaking occurs in the cantons of Switzerland from the 13th century. In 1848 the Swiss added the &quot;statute referendum&quot; to their national constitution, requiring the public to vote on if a constitutional change should occur. They soon discovered that merely having the power to veto Parliament&#x27;s laws was not enough. In 1891 they added the &quot;constitutional amendment initiative&quot;. Swiss politics since 1891 have given the world a valuable experience-base with the national-level constitutional amendment initiative. In the past 120 years, more than 240 initiatives have been put to referendums. Most popular initiatives are discussed and approved by the Parliament before the referendum. Out of the remaining initiatives that go to the referendum, only about 10% are approved by voters; in addition, voters often opt for a version of the initiative rewritten by the government. (See &quot;Direct democracy in Switzerland&quot; below.)

Some of the issues surrounding the related notion of a direct democracy using the Internet and other communications technologies are dealt with in the article on e-democracy and below under the heading &quot;Electronic direct democracy&quot;. More concisely, the concept of open-source governance applies principles of the free software movement to the governance of people, allowing the entire populace to participate in government directly, as much or as little as they please.

==Examples==
===Early Athens===

Athenian democracy developed in the Greek city-state of Athens, comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of Attica, around 600 BC. Athens was one of the first known democracies. Other Greek cities set up democracies, and even though most followed an Athenian model, none were as powerful, stable, or well-documented as that of Athens. In the direct democracy of Athens, the citizens did not nominate representatives to vote on legislation and executive bills on their behalf (as in the United States) but instead voted as individuals. The public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire of the comic poets in the theatres.

Solon (594 BC), Cleisthenes (508–507 BCE), and Ephialtes (462 BC) all contributed to the development of Athenian democracy. Historians differ on which of them was responsible for which institution, and which of them most represented a truly democratic movement. It is most usual to date Athenian democracy from Cleisthenes since Solon&#x27;s constitution fell and was replaced by the tyranny of Peisistratus, whereas Ephialtes revised Cleisthenes&#x27; constitution relatively peacefully.
Hipparchus, the brother of the tyrant Hippias, was killed by Harmodius and Aristogeiton, who were subsequently honored by the Athenians for their alleged restoration of Athenian freedom.

The greatest and longest-lasting democratic leader was Pericles; after his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by an oligarchic revolution towards the end of the Peloponnesian War. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides; the most detailed accounts are of this 4th-century modification rather than of the Periclean system. It was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but the extent to which they were a real democracy is debatable.

Sociologist Max Weber believed that every mass democracy went in a Caesarist direction. Professor of law Gerhard Casper writes, &quot;Weber employed the term to stress, inter alia, the plebiscitary character of elections, disdain for parliament, the non-toleration of autonomous powers within the government and a failure to attract or suffer independent political minds.&quot;

===Liechtenstein===
Direct democracy is considered to be an engrained element of Liechtensteiner politics.

If called for by at least 1,000 citizens, a referendum on any law can be initiated. Referendums can suspend parliament or change the constitution, but at least 1,500 citizens must vote affirmative, so referendums to suspend parliament or change the constitution fail if they have low turnout even if the required percentage of total voters is met.

===Switzerland===


The pure form of direct democracy exists only in the Swiss cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Glarus. The Swiss Confederation is a semi-direct democracy (representative democracy with strong instruments of direct democracy). The nature of direct democracy in Switzerland is fundamentally complemented by its federal governmental structures (in German also called the Subsidiaritätsprinzip).

Most western countries have representative systems. Switzerland is a rare example of a country with instruments of direct democracy (at the levels of the municipalities, cantons, and federal state). Citizens have more power than in a representative democracy. On any political level citizens can propose changes to the constitution (popular initiative) or ask for an optional referendum to be held on any law voted by the federal, cantonal parliament and/or municipal legislative body.

The list for mandatory or optional referendums on each political level are generally much longer in Switzerland than in any other country; for example, any amendment to the constitution must automatically be voted on by the Swiss electorate and cantons, on cantonal/communal levels often any financial decision of a certain substantial amount decreed by legislative and/or executive bodies as well.

Swiss citizens vote regularly on any kind of issue on every political level—such as financial approvals of a schoolhouse or the building of a new street, or the change of the policy regarding sexual work, or on constitutional changes, or on the foreign policy of Switzerland—four times a year. Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, on 103 federal questions besides many more cantonal and municipal questions. During the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums.

In Switzerland, simple majorities are sufficient at the municipal and cantonal level, at the federal level double majorities are required on constitutional issues.

A double majority requires approval by a majority of individuals voting, and also by a majority of cantons. Thus, in Switzerland, a citizen-proposed amendment to the federal constitution (i.e. popular initiative) cannot be passed at the federal level if a majority of the people approve but a majority of the cantons disapprove. For referendums or propositions in general terms (like the principle of a general revision of the Constitution), a majority of those voting is sufficient (Swiss Constitution, 2005).

In 1890, when the provisions for Swiss national citizen lawmaking were being debated by civil society and government, the Swiss adopted the idea of double majorities from the United States Congress, in which House votes were to represent the people and Senate votes were to represent the states. According to its supporters, this &quot;legitimacy-rich&quot; approach to national citizen lawmaking has been very successful. Kris Kobach, former Kansas elected official, claims that Switzerland has had tandem successes both socially and economically which are matched by only a few other nations. Kobach states at the end of his book, &quot;Too often, observers deem Switzerland an oddity among political systems. It is more appropriate to regard it as a pioneer.&quot; Finally, the Swiss political system, including its direct democratic devices in a multi-level governance context, becomes increasingly interesting for scholars of European Union integration.

===United States===
In the New England region of the United States, towns in states such as Vermont decide local affairs through the direct democratic process of the town meeting. This is the oldest form of direct democracy in the United States and predates the founding of the country by at least a century.

Direct democracy was not what the framers of the United States Constitution envisioned for the nation. They saw a danger in tyranny of the majority. As a result, they advocated a representative democracy in the form of a constitutional republic over a direct democracy. For example, James Madison, in Federalist No. 10, advocates a constitutional republic over direct democracy precisely to protect the individual from the will of the majority. He says,

Other framers spoke against pure democracy. John Witherspoon, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, said: &quot;Pure democracy cannot subsist long nor be carried far into the departments of state – it is very subject to caprice and the madness of popular rage.&quot; At the New York Ratifying Convention, Alexander Hamilton was quoted saying &quot;that a pure democracy, if it were practicable, would be the most perfect government. Experience has proved that no position is falser than this. The ancient democracies in which the people themselves deliberated never possessed one good feature of government. Their very character was tyranny; their figure, deformity.&quot;

Despite the framers&#x27; intentions at the beginning of the republic, ballot measures and their corresponding referendums have been widely used at the state and sub-state level. There is much state and federal case law, from the early 1900s to the 1990s, that protects the people&#x27;s right to each of these direct democracy governance components (Magleby, 1984, and Zimmerman, 1999). The first United States Supreme Court ruling in favor of the citizen lawmaking was in &quot;Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company v. Oregon&quot;, 223 U.S. 118 in 1912 (Zimmerman, December 1999). President Theodore Roosevelt, in his &quot;Charter of Democracy&quot; speech to the Ohio Constitutional Convention (1912), stated: &quot;I believe in the Initiative and Referendum, which should be used not to destroy representative government, but to correct it whenever it becomes misrepresentative.&quot;

In various states, referendums through which the people rule include:
* &quot;Referrals&quot; by the legislature to the people of &quot;proposed constitutional amendments&quot; (constitutionally used in 49 states, excepting only Delaware – Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute, 2004).
* &quot;Referrals&quot; by the legislature to the people of &quot;proposed statute laws&quot; (constitutionally used in all 50 states – Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute, 2004).
* &quot;Constitutional amendment initiative&quot; is a constitutionally defined petition process of &quot;proposed constitutional law&quot;, which, if successful, results in its provisions being written directly into the state&#x27;s constitution. Since constitutional law cannot be altered by state legislatures, this direct democracy component gives the people an automatic superiority and sovereignty, over representative government (Magelby, 1984). It is utilized at the state level in nineteen states: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon and South Dakota (Cronin, 1989). Among these states, there are three main types of the constitutional amendment initiative, with different degrees of involvement of the state legislature distinguishing between the types (Zimmerman, December 1999).
* &quot;Statute law initiative&quot; is a constitutionally defined, citizen-initiated petition process of &quot;proposed statute law&quot;, which, if successful, results in law being written directly into the state&#x27;s statutes. The statute initiative is used at the state level in twenty-one states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming (Cronin, 1989). In Utah, there is no constitutional provision for citizen lawmaking. All of Utah&#x27;s I&amp;R law is in the state statutes (Zimmerman, December 1999). In most states, there is no special protection for citizen-made statutes; the legislature can begin to amend them immediately.
* &quot;Statute law referendum&quot; is a constitutionally defined, citizen-initiated petition process of the &quot;proposed veto of all or part of a legislature-made law&quot;, which, if successful, repeals the standing law. It is used at the state level in twenty-four states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming (Cronin, 1989).
* The &quot;recall election&quot; is a citizen-initiated process which, if successful, removes an elected official from office and replaces him or her. The first recall device in the United States was adopted in Los Angeles in 1903. Typically, the process involves the collection of citizen petitions for the recall of an elected official; if a sufficient number of valid signatures are collected and verified, a recall election is triggered. There have been four gubernatorial recall elections in U.S. history (two of which resulted in the recall of the governor) and 38 recall elections for state legislators (55% of which succeeded). Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have a recall function for state officials. Additional states have recall functions for local jurisdictions. Some states require specific grounds for a recall petition campaign.
* &quot;Statute law affirmation&quot; is available in Nevada. It allows the voters to collect signatures to place on the ballot a question asking the state citizens to affirm a standing state law. Should the law get affirmed by a majority of state citizens, the state legislature will be barred from ever amending the law, and it can be amended or repealed only if approved by a majority of state citizens in a direct vote.

=== Direct democracy by country ===

The strength of direct democracy in individual countries can be quantitatively compared by the Citizen-initiated component of direct popular vote index in V-Dem Democracy indices. A higher index indicates more direct democracy popular initiatives and referendums, shown below for individual countries. Only countries with index above 0 are shown.
==Democratic reform trilemma==
Democratic theorists have identified a trilemma due to the presence of three desirable characteristics of an ideal system of direct democracy, which are challenging to deliver all at once. These three characteristics are &quot;participation&quot; – widespread participation in the decision-making process by the people affected; &quot;deliberation&quot; – a rational discussion where all major points of view are weighted according to evidence; and &quot;equality&quot; – all members of the population on whose behalf decisions are taken have an equal chance of having their views taken into account. Empirical evidence from dozens of studies suggests deliberation leads to better decision making. The most popularly disputed form of direct popular participation is the referendum on constitutional matters.

For the system to respect the principle of political equality, either &quot;everyone&quot; needs to be involved or there needs to be a representative random sample of people chosen to take part in the discussion. In the definition used by scholars such as James Fishkin, deliberative democracy is a form of direct democracy which satisfies the requirement for deliberation and equality but does not make provision to involve everyone who wants to be included in the discussion. Participatory democracy, by Fishkin&#x27;s definition, allows inclusive participation and deliberation, but at a cost of sacrificing equality, because if widespread participation is allowed, sufficient resources rarely will be available to compensate people who sacrifice their time to participate in the deliberation. Therefore, participants tend to be those with a strong interest in the issue to be decided and often will not therefore be representative of the overall population. Fishkin instead argues that random sampling should be used to select a small, but still representative, number of people from the general public.

Fishkin concedes it is possible to imagine a system that transcends the trilemma, but it would require very radical reforms if such a system were to be integrated into mainstream politics.

==Relation to other movements==

=== In schools ===
Democratic schools modeled on Summerhill School resolve conflicts and make school policy decisions through full school meetings in which the votes of students and staff are weighted equally.

==Criticism==

The core criticism of direct democracy coincides with democracy&#x27;s overall criticism. Critics have historically expressed doubts of the populace&#x27;s capacity of participation, both in terms of numbers and ability, deeming its advocates utopian. Despite this, instances of direct democracy - such as the Petrograd Soviet - lack documented incidents involving participation deficits or mobocracy.

From the liberal democratic standpoint, restraining popular influence stonewalls the state of nature, protecting property rights. Adversaries of greater democratization cast doubt on human nature, painting a narrative of misinformation and impulsivity. MAREZ, utilizing sortition, had managed itself successfully prior to being overrun by drug cartels, as did FEJUVE remaining tranquil with self-managed organizations.

Although Revolutionary Catalonia had demonstrated the feasibility of non-liberal democracy, critics have continued to deride its presumed mobocratic nature, although there are no recorded instances of tyranny of the majority. It is of note that direct democracy&#x27;s critics have emerged from Hobbesian and liberal philosophy.

<doc id="95821" wikidata="Q3536383" url="?curid=95821" title="Trading Spaces">
<text>Trading Spaces is an hour-long American television reality program that originally aired from 2000 to 2008 on the cable channels TLC and Discovery Home. The format of the show was based on the BBC TV series &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;. The first iteration ran for eight seasons. A revival began airing on April 7, 2018, with several team members of the original run returning.

==Premise==
In each episode, two sets of neighbors redecorated one room in each other&#x27;s home. Each two-person team had two (later, three) days, a budget of US$1,000, (later $2,000) and the services of a designer. Both teams in early seasons shared one carpenter, while later on, each team had a carpenter. Although the producers generally allowed the teams to go over budget slightly, there was one instance when a designer went $150 over budget and the producers forced her to return a rug she bought for the project.

The teams have no say over what happens in their own homes, but they are able to give input into what happens in the home they are redecorating. The teams are not allowed to enter their own home for the duration of the show, and the transformed rooms are revealed only at the end of the final day.

Ty Pennington, one of the show&#x27;s original carpenters, later hosted &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; on ABC.

==Production and changes==
The first season featured original host Alex McLeod and some designers who never returned to the show, such as Dez Ryan and Roderick Shade, and was produced by Knoxville, Tennessee–based RVIR Media. After the first 40 episodes, McLeod left to pursue other television opportunities. Beginning with the second season in 2001, Paige Davis took over as host, with the new production company Banyan Productions of Philadelphia. Early-season episodes were traditionally videotaped in and around the production company&#x27;s home base, as can be seen in those episode&#x27;s titles (where the city or state and the street are listed).

Beginning in the show&#x27;s fifth season, homeowners chose up to three rooms for their neighbors to re-decorate, and the rooms were selected randomly, with some rooms having increased budgets of $2000 or $3000. Midway through this season, Davis was dismissed, and the show went to a hostless format for several seasons and episodes often featured two carpenters. This change allowed the two homes to be farther apart, with the most extreme case featuring homes in New York and Oklahoma in the same episode.

On November 13, 2007, it was announced that Davis would be returning as the host of &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; beginning in January 2008. The first episode with Davis as host aired on January 26, 2008. The show also changed production companies, from Banyan Productions to A. Smith &amp; Co. Productions. On February 6, 2009, Davis announced that &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; was not picked up for a ninth season.

On March 28, 2017, TLC announced that it had ordered an eight-episode revival of &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; from Endemol Shine North America&#x27;s Authentic Entertainment. Host Paige Davis returned, joined by a number of cast members from the original era of the series, as well as new carpenters Brett Tutor and Joanie Dodd (billed as Joanie Sprague), new designers John Gidding, Kahi Lee, Sabrina Soto, and one-off crossovers from Nate Berkus and Jeremiah Brent (fellow TLC series &quot;Nate &amp; Jeremiah by Design&quot;) and Clinton Kelly (former fellow TLC series &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;). A reunion special hosted by Lisa Joyner was also planned to accompany the April 7, 2018 premiere, featuring appearances by other former cast members. The format remains relatively unchanged from the previous seasons, although the spending budget was increased to $2,000. There is also brand integration with the online retailers Overstock.com and Wayfair; one of the retailers provides a &quot;pop-up store&quot; with home décor products during each episode, where a homeowner may pick an item for incorporation into their respective room.

The two-hour premiere (which included part one of the reunion special and the season premiere episode) was seen by 2.8 million viewers, making it TLC&#x27;s highest-rated Saturday primetime program since 2010. On May 30, 2018, TLC renewed &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; for a tenth season, with a premiere date set for March 16, 2019, and twelve episodes produced. On November 10, 2019, host Paige Davis stated that there were not currently plans for an eleventh season.

==Spin-offs==
===&quot;Trading Spaces: Family&quot;===

The first spin-off, entitled &quot;Trading Spaces: Family&quot;, also aired on TLC (2003–2005). It allowed larger teams of three or four, including children considered too young to participate in the original &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; program. The same designers and carpenters (one per episode, shared by the two teams) worked with host Joe Farrell.

===&quot;Trading Spaces: Boys vs. Girls&quot;===

Another spin-off, &quot;Trading Spaces: Boys vs. Girls&quot; aired as a part of Discovery Kids along with airing on the network&#x27;s Saturday morning block on NBC). Unlike the original, this version used the same two designers and two carpenters for each episode. In addition, there is no budget limit, and the rooms are rebuilt into theme rooms, making the show look more like &quot;Monster House&quot;. Reruns aired on The Hub until June 2011.

===&quot;Trading Spaces: Home Free&quot;===
A spun off series produced for TLC in 2004. In this spin-off, the winning couple received their home mortgage-free.

===&quot;Trading Spaces: 100 Grand&quot;===
This was a special episode where the budget was increased to $50,000 per team (while keeping the standard time limit). Designer Doug Wilson and carpenter Amy Wynn Pastor completely remodeled and equipped a kitchen, while designer Laurie Smith and carpenter Ty Pennington completely remodeled and furnished a living room. Approximately two minutes of footage from this episode is included in the &quot;Trading Spaces: We&#x27;re Back&quot; online series.

===&quot;The Best Of Trading Spaces&quot;===
In January 2011, TLC&#x27;s sister channel OWN debuted &quot;The Best Of Trading Spaces&quot;, which revisits some of the traded spaces from the series. Paige Davis hosts the new segments, including interviews with the people who traded spaces in each episode and what has been changed in the spaces since the original episode aired.

===&quot;Training Spaces&quot;===

Initially commissioned as part of the series relaunch, &quot;Training Spaces&quot; is a &quot;GO ORIGINAL&quot; online series, available through TLC on demand, the TLC website, and the TLCgo app which serves as a bootcamp for carpenters and designers, hosted by Paige Davis.

Season 1 (April 7, 2018): The theme of Season 1 is &quot;3 new designers, 2 new carpenters, 1 epic bootcamp&quot;. Episode 1 features Tutor and Sprague being mentored by Pennington and Oosterhouse, while Episodes 2-6 feature Soto, Gidding and Lee being mentored by one of the veteran designers in each episode (Yip, Wilson, Santo-Tomás, Smith, Gorder).

Season 2 (March 11, 2019): The theme of Season 2 is &quot;6 contestants, 1 winner&quot;, as six designers compete to be a design assistant for veteran designer Frank Bielec in the upcoming season of &quot;Trading Spaces&quot;. In six of the seven episodes, one of the other veteran designers (Pennington, Smith, Oosterhouse, Wilson, Soto, Santo-Tomás) joins Bielec in challenging the contestants.

===&quot;Trading Spaces: We&#x27;re Back&quot;===

Also as part of the relaunch, TLC commissioned this online series of nine mini episodes featuring Davis and most of the returning series veterans reflecting on some of the best, worst and most memorable moments from the original run.

<text>Auraka is a locality in the Keia district, on the western side of the island of Mangaia in the Cook Islands. The Keia district contains at least two ancient burial caves, Kauvava and Piri Te Umeume, which were accessed by diagonal descents through boulder-strewn roof collapses from the top of the &quot;makatea&quot;, the limestone cliffs that form a concentric ring around the central basalt core of the island (Anton and Steadman 2003:133, 136). Gill, an early source for the mythology of Mangaia, noted a cave in Keia named Auraka, with one of its two entrances named Kauvava (1876a:71–79). However, according to Anton and Steadman (page 136), Gill&#x27;s &quot;description of the physical features of this cave does not match that of the cave currently known as Kauvava&quot;. Gill describes Auraka as a cave which is the &#x27;last resting-place of the dead&#x27; (Gill 1876b:202, 243).

==Claims of mythological associations==
In a few sources on the Internet, Auraka is erroneously described as a Polynesian god of death; these sources also claim that Auraka translates as &#x27;all-devouring&#x27;. However, the word &#x27;auraka&#x27; in Cook Islands Māori is a prohibitive adverb, with the approximate meaning &#x27;do not&#x27;; it does not mean &#x27;all-devouring&#x27;. The idea that Auraka is an all-devouring god of death appears to be a false assumption deriving from a misreading of Gill, where &#x27;all-devouring&#x27; is his translation of the word &#x27;maumau&#x27; in a line from a Mangaian song of mourning. The line that Gill translates as &quot;From all-devouring Auraka&quot; is &quot;O Rākā maumau e!&quot; (1846b:243). Gill comments on the same page that this is a reference to &quot;Auraka, the last resting-place of the dead&quot;, and he makes no suggestion that Auraka is a god of death rather than a burial cave. &#x27;All-devouring&#x27; is certainly possible as a poetic translation of &#x27;maumau&#x27;, the basic sense of which is &#x27;to be wasteful&#x27;; in the song, it is clear that &#x27;maumau&#x27; (and therefore &#x27;all-devouring&#x27;) is a poetic description, rather than a translation of the name.

<text>Hine is a surname deriving from Middle English.

==Etymology==

According to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland&quot;, the modern name &quot;Hine&quot; and its variants derive from the Middle English word &quot;hine&quot; (with the addition of the genitive &quot;-s&quot; case ending in forms like &quot;Hines&quot;, implying that the name-bearer was the child of a father called &quot;Hine&quot;, or addition of &quot;-s&quot; on the analogy of such names). This occupational name derives from Old English &quot;hīne&quot; (&#x27;household servant, farm labourer&#x27;), but in the Middle English period could also mean &#x27;farm manager&#x27; and also be used of high-status people serving in a lordly household.

==Distribution==
Around 2011, there were 2899 bearers of the surname &quot;Hine&quot; in Great Britain and 21 in Ireland. In 1881, there were 2301 bearers of the name in Great Britain, concentrated in Devon.

<text>Hine-nui-te-pō (&quot;the great woman of the night&quot;) in Māori legends, is a goddess of night who receives the spirits of humans when they die. She is the daughter of Tāne Mahuta / Tāne Tuturi and Hine-ahuone. It is believed among Māori that the colour red in the sky comes from her. Hine-nui-te-pō shepherds the wairua/souls into the first level of Rarohenga to ready them for the next stage of their journey. Before she was Hine-nui-te-po her name was Hine-ti-tama. Her father Tane Mahuta took her virginity; she then felt upset, hiding from her father in eternal darkness and became Hine-nui-te-po, goddess of the night.

== Background ==
Hine-nui-te-pō, also known as the &quot;Great Woman of Night&quot; is a giant goddess of death and the underworld. Her father is Tāne, the god of forests and land mammals. Her mother Hine-ahu-one is a human, made from earth. Hine-nui-te-pō is the second child of Tāne and Hine-ahu-one. Her birth name, Tikikapakapa, was changed shortly thereafter to Hine-au-tauria.

Hine-au-tauria marries her father Tāne and bears his children. She realizes he is her father, becomes ashamed, and goes down to the underground world, known as Pō (&quot;darkness&quot;). There, she becomes Hine-nui-te-pō, acquiring men&#x27;s souls while her father Tāne tries to lead them to light.

== Māui&#x27;s encounter with Hine-nui-te-pō ==
The great hero Māui is tricked by his father into thinking he has a chance to achieve immortality. In order to obtain this, Māui is told to enter into the goddess through her vagina. While Hine-nui-te-pō is asleep, Māui undresses himself ready to enter himself into the goddess. The birds who were nearby, fantails, burst into laughter, alerting Hine-nui-te-po. Hine-nui-te-po reacted by crushing him with the obsidian teeth in her vagina; Māui was the first man to die. The problematic themes of rape in this legend are acknowledged and used as an educational tool in contemporary times.

<text>In the traditions of ancient Hawaii, Kanaloa is a god symbolized by the squid or by the octopus, and is typically associated with Kāne. It is also an alternative name for the island of Kahoolawe.

Kanaloa is also considered to be the god of the Underworld and a teacher of magic. Legends state that he became the leader of the first group of spirits &quot;spit out&quot; by the gods. In time, he led them in a rebellion in which the spirits were defeated by the gods and as punishment were thrown in the Underworld. In traditional, pre-contact Hawaii, it was Milu who was the god of the Underworld and death, not Kanaloa; the related Miru traditions of other Polynesian cultures support this.

The Eye of Kanaloa is an esoteric symbol associated with the god in New Age Huna teaching, consisting of a seven-pointed star surrounded by concentric circles that are regularly divided by eight lines radiating from the inner-most circle to the outer-most circle. Huna, as a New Age religion developed in the 20th century by a Caucasian-American founder, bears no relation to the Native Hawaiian Religion. Native Hawaiians reject &quot;Huna&quot; as a mishmash of Hawaiian elements with European religious metaphysical ideas.

== As a namesake ==
After Kanaloa, one prince was named — he was a son of the Chief Kanipahu and one of his consorts, either Hualani or Alaʻikauakoko.

<text>The C shell (csh or the improved version, [[tcsh]]) is a Unix shell created by Bill Joy while he was a graduate student at University of California, Berkeley in the late 1970s. It has been widely distributed, beginning with the 2BSD release of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) which Joy first distributed in 1978. Other early contributors to the ideas or the code were Michael Ubell, Eric Allman, Mike O&#x27;Brien and Jim Kulp.

The C shell is a command processor which is typically run in a text window, allowing the user to type and execute commands. The C shell can also read commands from a file, called a script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for condition-testing and iteration. What differentiated the C shell from others, especially in the 1980s, were its interactive features and overall style. Its new features made it easier and faster to use. The overall style of the language looked more like C and was seen as more readable.

On many systems, such as macOS and Red Hat Linux, csh is actually tcsh, an improved version of csh. Often one of the two files is either a hard link or a symbolic link to the other, so that either name refers to the same improved version of the C shell. The original csh source code and binary are part of NetBSD.

On Debian and some derivatives (including Ubuntu), there are two different packages: csh and tcsh. The former is based on the original BSD version of csh and the latter is the improved tcsh.

tcsh added filename and command completion and command line editing concepts borrowed from the Tenex system, which is the source of the &quot;t&quot;. Because it only added functionality and did not change what already existed, tcsh remained backward compatible with the original C shell. Though it started as a side branch from the original source tree Joy had created, tcsh is now the main branch for ongoing development. tcsh is very stable but new releases continue to appear roughly once a year, consisting mostly of minor bug fixes.

== Design objectives and features ==

The main design objectives for the C shell were that it should look more like the C programming language and that it should be better for interactive use.

=== More like C ===

The Unix system had been written almost exclusively in C, so the C shell&#x27;s first objective was a command language that was more stylistically consistent with the rest of the system. The keywords, the use of parentheses, and the C shell&#x27;s built-in expression grammar and support for arrays were all strongly influenced by C.

By today&#x27;s standards, C shell may not seem particularly more C-like than many other popular scripting languages. But through the 80s and 90s, the difference was seen as striking, particularly when compared to Bourne shell (also known as &quot;sh&quot;), the then-dominant shell written by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs. This example illustrates the C shell&#x27;s more conventional expression operators and syntax.

The Bourne sh lacked an expression grammar. The square bracketed condition had to be evaluated by the slower means of running the external test program. sh&#x27;s codice_1 command took its argument words as a new command to be run as a child process. If the child exited with a zero return code, sh would look for a codice_2 clause (a separate statement, but often written joined on the same line with a semicolon) and run that nested block. Otherwise, it would run the else. Hard-linking the test program as both &quot;codice_3&quot; and &quot;codice_4&quot; gave the notational advantage of the square brackets and the appearance that the functionality of test was part of the sh language. sh&#x27;s use of a reversed keyword to mark the end of a control block was a style borrowed from ALGOL 68.

By contrast, csh could evaluate the expression directly, which made it faster. It also claimed better readability: Its expressions used a grammar and a set of operators mostly copied from C, none of its keywords were reversed and the overall style was also more like C.

Here is a second example, comparing scripts that calculate the first 10 powers of 2.

Again because of the lack of an expression grammar, the sh script uses command substitution and the expr command. (Modern POSIX shell &quot;does&quot; have such a grammar: the statement could be written or .)

Finally, here is a third example, showing the differing styles for a switch statement.

In the sh script, &quot;codice_5&quot; marks the end of each case because sh disallows null statements otherwise.

=== Improvements for interactive use ===

The second objective was that the C shell should be better for interactive use. It introduced numerous new features that made it easier, faster and more friendly to use by typing commands at a terminal. Users could get things done with a lot fewer keystrokes and it ran faster. The most significant of these new features were the history and editing mechanisms, aliases, directory stacks, tilde notation, cdpath, job control, and path hashing. These new features proved very popular, and many of them have since been copied by other Unix shells.

==== History ====

History allows users to recall previous commands and rerun them by typing only a few quick keystrokes. For example, typing two exclamation marks (&quot;codice_6&quot;) as a command causes the immediately preceding command to be run. Other short keystroke combinations, e.g., &quot;codice_7&quot; (meaning &quot;the final argument of the previous command&quot;), allow bits and pieces of previous commands to be pasted together and edited to form a new command.

==== Editing operators ====

Editing can be done not only on the text of a previous command, but also on variable substitutions. Operators range from simple string search/replace to parsing a pathname to extract a specific segment.

====Aliases====

Aliases allow the user to type the name of an alias and have the C shell expand it internally into whatever set of words the user has defined. For many simple situations, aliases run faster and are more convenient than scripts.

==== Directory stack ====

The directory stack allows the user to push or pop the current working directory, making it easier to jump back and forth between different places in the filesystem.

==== Tilde notation ====

Tilde notation offers a shorthand way of specifying pathnames relative to the home directory using the &quot;codice_8&quot; character.

==== Filename completion ====

The escape key can be used interactively to show possible completions of a filename at the end of the current command line.

==== Cdpath ====

Cdpath extends the notion of a search path to the codice_9 (change directory) command: If the specified directory is not in the current directory, csh will try to find it in the cdpath directories.

====Job control====

Well into the 1980s, most users only had simple character-mode terminals that precluded multiple windows, so they could only work on one task at a time. The C shell&#x27;s job control allowed the user to suspend the current activity and create a new instance of the C shell, called a job, by typing codice_10. The user could then switch back and forth between jobs using the fg command. The active job was said to be in the foreground. Other jobs were said to be either suspended (stopped) or running in the background.

==== Path hashing ====

Path hashing speeds up the C shell&#x27;s search for executable files. Rather than performing a filesystem call in each path directory, one at a time, until it either finds the file or runs out of possibilities, the C shell consults an internal hash table built by scanning the path directories. That table can usually tell the C shell where to find the file (if it exists) without having to search and can be refreshed with the codice_11 command.

== Overview of the language ==

The C shell operates one line at a time. Each line is tokenized into a set of words separated by spaces or other characters with special meaning, including parentheses, piping and input/output redirection operators, semicolons, and ampersands.

=== Basic statements ===

A basic statement is one that simply runs a command. The first word is taken as name of the command to be run and may be either an internal command, e.g., codice_12, or an external command. The rest of the words are passed as arguments to the command.

At the basic statement level, here are some of the features of the grammar:

==== Wildcarding ====

The C shell, like all Unix shells, treats any command-line argument that contains wildcard characters as a pattern and replaces it with the list of all the filenames that match (see globbing).

*codice_13 matches any number of characters.
*codice_14 matches any single character.
*codice_4...codice_16 matches any of the characters inside the square brackets. Ranges are allowed, using the hyphen.
*codice_17...codice_16 matches any character &quot;not&quot; in the set.

The C shell also introduced several notational conveniences (sometimes known as extended globbing), since copied by other Unix shells.

*codice_19 is alternation (aka brace expansion) and expands to &quot;abcdef&quot; &quot;abcghi&quot;.
*codice_8 means the current user&#x27;s home directory.
*codice_21 means &quot;user&quot;&#x27;s home directory.

Multiple directory-level wildcards, e.g., &quot;codice_22&quot;, are supported.

Since version 6.17.01, recursive wildcarding à la zsh (e.g. &quot;codice_23&quot; or &quot;codice_24&quot;) is also supported with the codice_25 option.

Giving the shell the responsibility for interpreting wildcards was an important decision on Unix. It meant that wildcards would work with every command, and always in the same way. However, the decision relied on Unix&#x27;s ability to pass long argument lists efficiently through the exec system call that csh uses to execute commands. By contrast, on Windows, wildcard interpretation is conventionally performed by each application. This is a legacy of MS-DOS, which only allowed a 128-byte command line to be passed to an application, making wildcarding by the DOS command prompt impractical. Although modern Windows can pass command lines of up to roughly 32K Unicode characters, the burden for wildcard interpretation remains with the application.

==== I/O redirection ====

By default, when csh runs a command, the command inherits the csh&#x27;s stdio file handles for stdin, stdout and stderr, which normally all point to the console window where the C shell is running. The i/o redirection operators allow the command to use a file instead for input or output.

*codice_26&quot;file&quot; means stdout will be written to &quot;file&quot;, overwriting it if it exists, and creating it if it doesn&#x27;t. Errors still come to the shell window.
*codice_27&quot;file&quot; means both stdout and stderr will be written to &quot;file&quot;, overwriting it if it exists, and creating it if it doesn&#x27;t.
*codice_28&quot;file&quot; means stdout will be appended at the end of &quot;file&quot;.
*codice_29&quot;file&quot; means both stdout and stderr will be appended at the end of &quot;file&quot;.
*codice_30&quot;file&quot; means stdin will be read from &quot;file&quot;.
*codice_31&quot;string&quot; is a here document. Stdin will read the following lines up to the one that matches &quot;string&quot;.

Redirecting stderr alone isn&#x27;t possible without the aid of a sub-shell.

set filter = &quot;$home&quot;&#x27;/filter&#x27;
mkfifo ”$filter&quot;
cat &quot;$filter&quot; &amp; ( ( ls /root/ || echo No access. ) &gt; &quot;$filter&quot; ) &gt;&amp; /dev/null
Systems supporting file descriptors as files may use the following workaround.

( ( ( echo ok ; &quot; ) &gt; /dev/fd/0 ) &gt;&amp; /dev/null &lt; /dev/fd/1 ) | ( echo &quot;$&lt;&quot; bye )
==== Joining ====

Commands can be joined on the same line.

*codice_32 means run the first command and then the next.
*codice_33 means run the first command and, if it succeeds with a 0 return code, run the next.
*codice_34 means run the first command and, if it fails with a non-zero return code, run the next.

==== Piping ====

Commands can be connected using a pipe, which causes the output of one command to be fed into the input of the next. Both commands run concurrently.

*codice_35 means connect stdout to stdin of the next command. Errors still come to the shell window.
*codice_36 means connect both stdout and stderr to stdin of the next command.

Running concurrently means &quot;in parallel&quot;. In a multi-core (multiple processor) system, the piped commands may literally be executing at the same time, otherwise the scheduler in the operating system time-slices between them.

Given a command, e.g., &quot;codice_37&quot;, the shell creates a pipe, then starts both codice_38 and codice_39 with stdio for the two commands redirected so that codice_38 writes its stdout into the input of the pipe while codice_39 reads stdin from the output of the pipe. Pipes are implemented by the operating system with a certain amount of buffering so that codice_38 can write for a while before the pipe fills but once the pipe fills any new write will block inside the OS until codice_39 reads enough to unblock new writes. If codice_39 tries to read more data than is available, it will block until codice_38 has written more data or until the pipe closes, e.g., if codice_38 exits.

==== Variable substitution ====

If a word contains a dollar sign, &quot;codice_47&quot;, the following characters are taken as the name of a variable and the reference is replaced by the value of that variable. Various editing operators, typed as suffixes to the reference, allow pathname editing (e.g., &quot;codice_48&quot; to extract just the extension) and other operations.

==== Quoting and escaping ====

Quoting mechanisms allow otherwise special characters, such as whitespace, wildcards, parentheses, and dollar signs, to be taken as literal text.

*codice_49 means take the next character as an ordinary literal character.
*codice_50&quot;string&quot;codice_50 is a weak quote. Enclosed whitespace and wildcards are taken as literals, but variable and command substitutions are still performed.
*codice_52&quot;string&quot;codice_52 is a strong quote. The entire enclosed string is taken as a literal.

Double quotes inside double quotes should be escaped with codice_54. The same applies to the dollar symbol, to prevent variable expansion codice_55. For backticks, to prevent command substitution nesting, single quotes are required codice_56.

==== Command substitution ====

Command substitution allows the output of one command to be used as arguments to another.

*codice_57&quot;command&quot;codice_57 means take the output of &quot;command&quot;, parse it into words and paste them back into the command line.

The following is an example of nested command substitutions with Leaning toothpick syndrome :

echo &quot;`echo &quot;\&quot;\`&quot;echo &quot;\&quot;\\\&quot;\\\`\&quot;&quot;echo &quot;\&quot;\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\`\\\&quot;\&quot;&quot;echo &quot;\&quot;\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\&quot;\\\&quot;\&quot;&quot;echo &quot;\&quot;\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;\\\&quot;\&quot;&quot;pwd&quot;\&quot;\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\&quot;\\\&quot;\\\`\\\&quot;\&quot;\`\&quot;&quot;`&quot;
==== Background execution ====

Normally, when the C shell starts a command, it waits for the command to finish before giving the user another prompt signaling that a new command can be typed.

*&quot;command&quot;codice_59 means start &quot;command&quot; in the background and prompt immediately for a new command.

==== Subshells ====

A subshell is a separate child copy of the shell that inherits the current state but can then make changes, e.g., to the current directory, without affecting the parent.

*codice_60&quot;commands&quot;codice_61 means run &quot;commands&quot; in a subshell.

=== Control structures ===

The C shell provides control structures for both condition-testing and iteration. The condition-testing control structures are the if and switch statements. The iteration control structures are the while, foreach and repeat statements.

==== if statement ====

There are two forms of the if statement. The short form is typed on a single line but can specify only a single command if the expression is true.

if ( expression ) command

The long form uses then, else and endif keywords to allow for blocks of commands to be nested inside the condition.
if ( expression1 ) then
 commands
else if ( expression2 ) then
 commands
else
 commands
endif
If the else and if keywords appear on the same line, csh chains, rather than nests them; the block is terminated with a single endif.

==== switch statement ====

The switch statement compares a string against a list of patterns, which may contain wildcard characters. If nothing matches, the default action, if there is one, is taken.
switch ( string )
 case pattern1:
 commands
 breaksw
 case pattern2:
 commands
 breaksw
 default:
 commands
 breaksw
endsw
==== while statement ====

The while statement evaluates an expression. If it is true, the shell runs the nested commands and then repeats for as long as the expression remains true.
while ( expression )
 commands
end
==== foreach statement ====

The foreach statement takes a list of values, usually a list of filenames produced by wildcarding, and then for each, sets the loop variable to that value and runs the nested commands.

foreach loop-variable ( list-of-values )
 commands
end
==== repeat statement ====

The repeat statement repeats a single command an integral number of times.

repeat integer command

=== Variables ===

The C shell implements both shell and environment variables. Environment variables, created using the codice_62 statement, are always simple strings, passed to any child processes, which retrieve these variables via the codice_63 argument to codice_64.

Shell variables, created using the codice_65 or codice_66 statements, are internal to C shell. They are not passed to child processes. Shell variables can be either simple strings or arrays of strings. Some of the shell variables are predefined and used to control various internal C shell options, e.g., what should happen if a wildcard fails to match anything.

In current versions of csh, strings can be of arbitrary length, well into millions of characters.

Variables can be enlarged as needed. However, if it&#x27;s desirable to work on a fixed size, the following syntax is preferred.

# Creates a variable large enough to hold 1024 elements.
set fixed = {,}{,}{,}{,}{,}{,}{,}{,}{,}{,}
=== Expressions ===

The C shell implements a 32-bit integer expression grammar with operators borrowed from C but with a few additional operators for string comparisons and filesystem tests, e.g., testing for the existence of a file. Operators must be separated by whitespace from their operands. Variables are referenced as codice_47&quot;name&quot;.

Operator precedence is also borrowed from C, but with different operator associativity rules to resolve the ambiguity of what comes first in a sequence of equal precedence operators. In C, the associativity is left-to-right for most operators; in C shell, it is right-to-left. For example,

The parentheses in the C shell example are to avoid having the bit-shifting operators confused as I/O redirection operators. In either language, parentheses can always be used to explicitly specify the desired order of evaluation, even if only for clarity.

Return values are limited to 8-bit. For codice_68 expressions, the unary negation operator can be used for 32-bit evaluation.

exit ! ! 256 # Returns 1.
== Reception ==
Although Stephen Bourne himself acknowledged that csh was superior to his shell for interactive use, it has never been as popular for scripting.

In 1983, both csh and Bourne shell were available for Charles River Data Systems&#x27; UNOS operating system among other UNIX tools under Bell Laboratories license.

Initially, and through the 1980s, csh could not be guaranteed to be present on all Unix and Unix-like systems, but sh could, which made it a better choice for any scripts that might have to run on other machines. By the mid-1990s, csh was widely available, but the use of csh for scripting faced new criticism by the POSIX committee, which specified that there should only be one preferred shell, the KornShell, for both interactive and scripting purposes. The C shell also faced criticism from others over the C shell&#x27;s alleged defects in syntax, missing features, and poor implementation.

*Syntax defects: were generally simple but unnecessary inconsistencies in the definition of the language. For example, the codice_65, codice_62 and codice_71 commands all did basically the same thing, namely, associate a name with a string or set of words. But all three had slight but unnecessary differences. An equal sign was required for a codice_65 but not for codice_62 or codice_71; parentheses were required around a word list for a codice_65 but not for codice_62 or codice_71, etc. Similarly, the codice_1, codice_79 and looping constructs use needlessly different keywords (codice_80, codice_81 and codice_82) to terminate the nested blocks.
*Missing features: most commonly cited are the lack of ability to manipulate the stdio file handles independently and support for functions. Although lacking support for functions, aliases serve as workaround. For multiple lines of code, aliases must be within single quotes, and each end of line must precede a backslash (the end of the last line must precede a single quote to delimit the end of the alias). Recursion is favorable over aliases in scripts as workaround for functions (an example is given below).
*The implementation: which used an ad hoc parser, has drawn the most serious criticism. By the early 1970s, compiler technology was sufficiently mature that most new language implementations used either a top-down or bottom-up parser capable of recognizing a fully recursive grammar. It is not known why an ad hoc design was chosen instead for the C shell. It may be simply that, as Joy put it in an interview in 2009, &quot;When I started doing this stuff with Unix, I wasn’t a very good programmer.&quot; The ad hoc design meant that the C shell language was not fully recursive. There was a limit to how complex a command it could handle.

It worked for most interactively typed commands, but for the more complex commands a user might write in a script, it could easily fail, producing only a cryptic error message or an unwelcome result. For example, the C shell could not support piping between control structures. Attempting to pipe the output of a codice_83 command into codice_84 simply didn&#x27;t work. (The work-around, which works for many of the complaints related to the parser, is to break the code up into separate scripts. If the codice_83 is moved to a separate script, piping works because scripts are run by forking a new copy of csh that does inherit the correct stdio handles. It&#x27;s also possible to break codes in a single file. An example is given below on how to break codes in a single file.)

Another example is the unwelcome behavior in the following fragments. Both of these appear to mean, &quot;If &#x27;myfile&#x27; does not exist, create it by writing &#x27;mytext&#x27; into it.&quot; But the version on the right always creates an empty file because the C shell&#x27;s order of evaluation is to look for and evaluate I/O redirection operators on each command line as it reads it, before examining the rest of the line to see whether it contains a control structure.

The implementation is also criticized for its notoriously poor error messages, e.g., &quot;0: Event not found.&quot;, which yields no useful information about the problem.

However, by practicing, it&#x27;s possible to overcome those deficiencies (thus instructing the programmer to take better and safer approaches on implementing a script).

The &quot;0: Event not found.&quot; error implies there aren&#x27;t saved commands in the history. The history may not work properly in scripts, but having a pre-set of commands in a variable serves as workaround.

#!/bin/csh -f
set cmdlist = ( &#x27;date # 1&#x27;\
&#x27;uname # 2&#x27;\
&#x27;tty # 3&#x27;\
&#x27;id # 4&#x27; )
echo -n &#x27;Enter a number to execute a command from the history: &#x27;
set cmdexec = &quot;$&lt;&quot;
( exit ( ! ( &quot;$cmdexec&quot; &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; \
&quot;$cmdexec&quot; &lt;= &quot;$#cmdlist&quot; ) ) ) &gt;&amp; /dev/null
if ( &quot;$status&quot; ) then
 echo &#x27;Invalid event number.&#x27;
 foreach cmd ( $cmdlist:q )
 echo &quot;$cmd&quot;
 end
 exit -1
endif
eval &quot;$cmdlist[$cmdexec]&quot;
Prefer breaking codes by recursing the script as workaround for functions.

#!/bin/csh -f
if ( ! &quot;$?main&quot; ) then
 if ( ! &quot;$?0&quot; ) then
 echo &#x27;You must run this script by explicitly calling its file.&#x27;
 exit -1
 endif
 alias function &#x27;set argv = ( \!* ) ; source &quot;$main&quot;&#x27;
 set main = &quot;$0&quot;
 set ret = &quot;`function myfunc`&quot;
 echo &quot;$ret&quot;
 exit
endif

goto &quot;$1&quot; ; shift

myfunc:
function myfunc2
echo &quot;A function.&quot;
exit

myfunc2:
echo &quot;Another function.&quot;
exit
== Influence ==

The C shell was extremely successful in introducing a large number of innovations including the history mechanism, aliases, tilde notation, interactive filename completion, an expression grammar built into the shell, and more, that have since been copied by other Unix shells. But in contrast to sh, which has spawned a large number of independently developed clones, including ksh and bash, only two csh clones are known. (Since tcsh was based on the csh code originally written by Bill Joy, it is not considered a clone.)

In 1986, Allen Holub wrote &quot;On Command: Writing a Unix-Like Shell for MS-DOS&quot;, a book describing a program he had written called &quot;SH&quot; but which in fact copied the language design and features of csh, not sh. Companion diskettes containing full source for SH and for a basic set of Unix-like utilities (cat, cp, grep, etc.) were available for $25 and $30, respectively, from the publisher. The control structures, expression grammar, history mechanism and other features in Holub&#x27;s SH were identical to those of the C shell.

In 1988, Hamilton Laboratories began shipping Hamilton C shell for OS/2. It included both a csh clone and a set of Unix-like utilities. In 1992, Hamilton C shell was released for Windows NT. The Windows version continues to be actively supported but the OS/2 version was discontinued in 2003. An early 1990 quick reference described the intent as &quot;full compliance with the entire C shell language (except job control)&quot; but with improvements to the language design and adaptation to the differences between Unix and a PC. The most important improvement was a top-down parser that allowed control structures to be nested or piped, something the original C shell could not support, given its ad hoc parser. Hamilton also added new language features including built-in and user-defined procedures, block-structured local variables and floating point arithmetic. Adaptation to a PC included support for the filename and other conventions on a PC and the use of threads instead of forks (which were not available under either OS/2 or Windows) to achieve parallelism, e.g., in setting up a pipeline.

<text>Marama is a Polynesian deity of varying representation and importance depending on the society or tribe being discussed. 

To the Maori people, Marama is the moon, a male deity who married Hina, the daughter of Tangaroa. However, the moon is also considered to be the husband of all women due to the effect of the moon on women every month. In the Gambier Islands, Marama is also considered to be the moon, however in Samoa and Tahiti, Marama is considered to be the deity of Light, highlighting how different mythology can be, especially across the vast expanse of Oceania. In Samoa, Marama is also considered to be the founder and patron of woodworkers and carpenters. 

== Genealogy ==
Little is known about Marama, many mentions of him are only to explain the genealogy of other more prominent gods of the time. The genealogy is as follows: First there is the Supreme Being, Io, from Io comes Marama and from Marama is Po. Finally, from Po, is Rangi and Papa, Heaven Father and Earth Mother, from which all other gods were descended.

<doc id="95838" wikidata="Q1642345" url="?curid=95838" title="Orkneyinga saga">
<text>The Orkneyinga saga (Old Norse: ; also called the History of the Earls of Orkney and Jarls&#x27; Saga) is a narrative of the history of the Orkney and Shetland islands and their relationship with other local polities, particularly Norway and Scotland. The saga has &quot;no parallel in the social and literary record of Scotland&quot; and is &quot;the only medieval chronicle to have Orkney as the central place of action&quot;. The main focus of the work is the line of &quot;jarls&quot; who ruled the Earldom of Orkney, which constituted the &quot;Norðreyjar&quot; or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland and there are frequent references to both archipelagoes throughout.

The narrative commences with a brief mythical ancestry tale and then proceeds to outline the Norse take-over of the &quot;Norðreyjar&quot; by Harald Fairhair – the take-over is not in doubt although the role of the king is no longer accepted by historians as a likelihood. The saga then outlines, with varying degrees of detail, the lives and times of the many &quot;jarls&quot; who ruled the islands between the 9th and 13th centuries. The extent to which the earlier sections in particular can be considered genuine history rather than fiction has been much debated by scholars.

There are several recurring themes in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, including strife between brothers, relationships between the jarls and the Norwegian crown, and raiding in the &quot;Suðreyjar&quot; – the Hebrides and elsewhere. In part, the saga&#x27;s purpose was to provide a history of the islands and enable its readers to &quot;understand themselves through a knowledge of their origins&quot; but even where its historical accuracy is lacking it provides modern scholars with insights into the motives of the writers and the politics of 13th century Orkney.

==Development and versions==

The original text of this Norse saga was written in the late twelfth century. It no longer exists. A new version was written in the early thirteenth century (three centuries after some of the earliest events it records) by an unknown Icelandic author who was probably associated with the cultural centre at Oddi. &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; belongs to the genre of &quot;Kings&#x27; Sagas&quot; within Icelandic saga literature, a group of histories of the kings of Norway, the best known of which is &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, written by Snorri Sturluson. Indeed, Snorri used &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; as one of his sources for &quot;Heimskringla&quot; which was compiled around 1230 (and then &quot;Heimskringla&quot; became in turn a source for later versions of the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;).

As was generally the case with Icelandic language writing of this period, the aims of the saga were to provide a sense of social continuity through the telling of history combined with an entertaining narrative drive. The saga is thought to have been compiled from a number of sources, combining family pedigrees, praise poetry and oral legends with historical facts. In the case of the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; the document outlines the lives of the earls of Orkney and how they came about their earldom. Woolf (2007) suggests that the task that the Icelandic compiler was faced with was not dissimilar to trying to write a &quot;history of the Second World War on the basis of Hollywood movies&quot;. He also notes that a problem with medieval Icelandic historiography in general is the difficulty of fixing of a clear chronology based on stories created in a largely illiterate society in which &quot;AD dating was probably unknown&quot;.

As the narrative approaches the period closer to the time it was written down, some historians have greater confidence in its accuracy. For example, there are significant family connections between Snorri Sturluson and Earl Harald Maddadsson (d. 1206) and the original saga document was probably written down at about the time of Harald&#x27;s death.

Gudbrand Vigfússon (1887) identified several different components to the saga, which may have had different authors and date from different periods. These are:
*&quot;Fundinn Noregr&quot; chapters 1–3
*&quot;Iarla Sogur&quot; chapters 4–38 (of which the sections regarding Earl Einarr are the oldest texts in the saga as a whole)
*&quot;St Magnus saga&quot; chapters 39–55
*&quot;Iarteina-bok&quot; (Magnus&#x27;s &quot;Miracle book&quot;) chapter 60
*&quot;The History of Earl Rognwald and Swain Asleifsson&quot; chapters 56–59 and 61–118.

A Danish translation dating to 1570 indicates that the original version of the saga ended with the death of Sweyn Asleifsson, who (according to the saga) was killed fighting in Dublin in 1171. Various additions were then added circa 1234-5 when a grandson of Asleifsson and a lawmaker called Hrafn visited Iceland. The oldest complete text is found in the late 14th century &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot; but the first translation into English did not appear until 1873.

==Narrative==
The first three chapters of the saga are a brief folk legend that sets the scene for later events. It commences with characters associated with the elements – Snaer (snow), Logi (flame), Kari (storm) and Frosti (frost) and also gives a unique explanation for how Norway came to be named as such, involving Snaer&#x27;s grandson Nór. There is also a reference to claiming land by dragging a boat over a neck of land (reprised in chapter 41 when Magnus Barefoot uses the same trick) and the division of the land between Nór and his brother Gór, which is a recurring theme in the saga. This legend also gives the Orkney &quot;jarls&quot; an origin involving a giant and king called Fornjót who lived in the far north. This clearly distinguishes them from the Norwegian kings as described in the &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and may have been intended to give the &quot;jarls&quot; a more senior and more Nordic ancestry.

Having dealt with the mythical ancestry of the earls, the saga then moves on to topics that are apparently intended as genuine history.

===Harald Fairhair and the voyage to the west===
The next few chapters deal with the creation of the Earldom of Orkney; they are brief and contain much less detail than the later events the saga describes. The saga states that Rognvald Eysteinsson Earl Rognvald retains the rule of Møre by the King of Norway, Harald Fairhair. Earl Rognvald accompanied the king on an expedition where they conquer the islands of Shetland, called Hjaltland, and Orkney, before they continued on to Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man. During this campaign Rognvald&#x27;s son Ivarr was killed and in compensation Harald granted Earl Rognvald to rule over Orkney and Shetland. Rognvald Earl thereafter returned to Norway, giving these islands to his brother Sigurd Eysteinsson. Sigurd had been the forecastleman on Harald&#x27;s ship and after sailing back east the king &quot;gave Sigurd the title of earl&quot;.

Sigurd &quot;the Mighty&quot; then died in a curious fashion, following a battle with Máel Brigte of Moray. Sigurd&#x27;s son Gurthorm ruled for a single winter after this and died childless. Rognvald&#x27;s son Hallad then inherited the title. However, unable to constrain Danish raids on Orkney, he gave up the earldom and returned to Norway, which &quot;everyone thought was a huge joke.&quot; 

First written down in the early 13th century, the saga is informed by the Norwegian politics of the day. Once, historians could write that no-one denied the reality of Harald Fairhair&#x27;s expeditions to the west (recounted in detail in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;), but this is no longer the case. Thomson (2008) writes that Harald&#x27;s &quot;great voyage is so thoroughly ingrained in popular and scholarly history, both ancient and modern, that it comes as a bit of a shock to realise that it might not be true.&quot; The Norwegian contest with the Kings of Scots over the Hebrides and the Isle of Man in the mid 13th century is the backdrop to the saga writer&#x27;s intentions and in part at least the sagas aim to legitimise Norwegian claims to both the Northern Isles and the Kingdom of the Isles in the west.

It may be that the saga writers drew on a genuine tradition of a voyage by Harald to the west, or that they simply invented it wholesale for political purposes, but it is possible that there are elements included in the narrative that are drawn from the much later expeditions undertaken by Magnus Barefoot. The situation faced by Earl Harald Maddadsson of Orkney in 1195, shortly before the time that the sagas were first written down, when he was forced to submit himself to royal authority after an ill-judged intervention in Norwegian affairs would have made legendary material of this nature of considerable interest in Orkney at the time. Nonetheless, the view that the Orkney earldom was created by &quot;members of the Møre family&quot; continues to receive academic support.

===Torf-Einarr===
Hallad&#x27;s failure led to Rognvald flying into a rage and summoning his sons Thorir and Hrollaug. He asked which of them wanted the islands but Thorir said the decision was up to the earl himself. Rognvald predicted that Thorir&#x27;s path would keep him in Norway and that Hrollaug was destined seek his fortune in Iceland. Einarr, the youngest of his natural sons, then came forward and offered to go to the islands. Rognvald said: &quot;Considering the kind of mother you have, slave-born on each side of her family, you are not likely to make much of a ruler. But I agree, the sooner you leave and the later you return the happier I&#x27;ll be.&quot; Despite his father&#x27;s misgivings, on arrival on the islands, Einarr fought and defeated two Danish warlords who had taken residence there. Einarr then established himself as earl and founded a dynasty which retained control of the islands for centuries after his death.
The scene in which Einarr&#x27;s father scorns him is a literary device which often figures in Old Norse literature. The dialogue between the father and his sons has been interpreted as being about Rognvald&#x27;s desire to cement his own position as Earl of Møre and an allusion to the early history of Iceland, where the saga was written. Thorir is a compliant son who Rognvald is happy to keep at home. Hrolluag is portrayed as a man of peace who will go to Iceland. Einarr is aggressive and a threat to his father&#x27;s position so can be spared for the dangers of Orkney. (In the &quot;Landnámabók&quot; version the equally aggressive brother Hrolfr is also present, and his destiny is anticipated to be in conveniently far-away Normandy.)
Einarr is also provided with various characteristics associated with Odin. Both have but one eye and the death of an opponent at Einarr&#x27;s hands is offered to the god—an act that contains a hint of Odin&#x27;s own sacrifice to himself in the Hávamál. Einarr is a man of action who is self-made, and he is a successful warrior who (unlike his brothers) avenges his father&#x27;s death. He leads a dramatic and memomorable life and emerges as &quot;ancient, powerful and mysterious—but as a literary figure rather than a real person&quot;. He is also a whose appearance at the commencement of the saga contrasts with the later martyrdom of his descendant St Magnus. That event marks a &quot;moral high-point&quot; of the story.

===Sigurd the Stout===
The death of Earl Sigurd Hlodvirsson (980–1014) is the subject of earliest known contemporary reference to the earldom of Orkney. The 12th-century Irish source, the &quot;Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh&quot;, records the events of the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. The &quot;foreigners and Leinstermen&quot; were led by Brodir of the Isle of Man and Sigurd, and the battle lasted all day, but the Irishmen ultimately drove back their enemies into the sea. His death is corroborated by the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, which record that amongst the dead was &quot;Siuchraid son of Loduir, iarla Innsi Orcc&quot; (i.e. of Sigurd, son of Hlodvir, Earl of Orkney).

According to the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, the Northern Isles had been Christianised by King Olaf Tryggvasson in 995 when he stopped at South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway. The King summoned &quot;jarl&quot; Sigurd and said &quot;I order you and all your subjects to be baptised. If you refuse, I&#x27;ll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel.&quot; Unsurprisingly, Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke. However, when the sagas were written down Orkney had been Christian for 200 years or more and the conversion tale itself has been described as &quot;blatantly unhistorical&quot;. Some have argued that when the Norse arrived in the Northern Isles they would have found organised Christianity already thriving there, although there is no mention of this at all in the sagas.

===Earl Thorfinn===
Virtually nothing about Thorfinn Sigurdsson&#x27;s life is corroborated from contemporary sources and the saga writer seems to have obtained most of his material from the poem &quot;Þórfinnsdrápa&quot;, which was written by his court poet Arnór immediately following his death.

The &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; says that a dispute between Thorfinn and Karl Hundason began when the latter became &quot;King of Scots&quot; and claimed Caithness, his forces successfully moving north and basing themselves in Thurso. In the war which followed, Thorfinn defeated Karl in a sea-battle off Deerness at the east end of the Orkney Mainland. Then Karl&#x27;s nephew Mutatan or Muddan, appointed to rule Caithness for him, was killed in Caithness by Thorkel Fosterer. Finally, a great battle at &quot;Torfness&quot; (probably Tarbat Ness on the south side of the Dornoch Firth) ended with Karl either being killed or forced to flee. Thorfinn, the saga says, then marched south through Scotland as far as Fife, burning and plundering as he passed. As a result of his military exploits Thorfinn became Mormaer of Caithness and during the first twenty years of his long earldom he was often based there. He was thus a vassal of both the King of Norway and the King of Scots, a status and title that was held by many of his successors. Thorfinn also became King of the Isles from 1035, which title was only held amongst the earls of Orkney by Sigurd Eysteinsson before him, and after him possibly by Einar Sigurdsson and for a brief period by Sigurd Magnusson as the under-age son of Magnus Barefoot.

===St Magnus===
Magnus Erlendsson, Thorfinn&#x27;s grandson, had a reputation for piety and gentleness, which the Norwegians viewed as cowardice. Having been taken hostage by King Magnus Barefoot, he refused to fight in a Viking raid in Anglesey because of his religious convictions, and instead stayed on board the ship during the Battle of Menai Straits, singing psalms. His brother Erling died while campaigning with King Magnus, either at that same battle or in Ulster.

Magnus was obliged to take refuge in Scotland, but returned to Orkney in 1105 and disputed the succession with his cousin Haakon Paulsson. Having failed to reach an agreement, he sought help from King Eystein I of Norway, who granted him the earldom of Orkney and he ruled jointly and amicably with Haakon until 1114. Eventually however, the followers of the two earls fell out, and the sides met at an assembly on the Orkney mainland in 1117. Peace was negotiated and the Earls arranged to meet each other to formalise this at Easter on the island of Egilsay, each bringing only two ships. Magnus arrived with his two, but then Haakon treacherously turned up with eight ships.

Magnus took refuge in the island&#x27;s church overnight, but the following day he was captured and an angry Haakon made his cook Lifolf kill Magnus by striking him on the head with an axe. It was said that Magnus first prayed for the souls of his executioners. Sometime later William the Old, Bishop of Orkney, was struck blind in his church, but subsequently had his sight restored after praying at the grave of Magnus. He also later sanctified the murdered Earl. St Magnus Church, Egilsay, was constructed on the island shortly afterwards, at or near the supposed site of the murder.

Magnus&#x27;s nephew, Rögnvald Kali Kolsson, laid claim to the Earldom of Orkney, and was advised by his father Kol to promise the islanders to &quot;build a stone minster at Kirkwall&quot; in memory of his uncle the Holy Earl, and this became St Magnus Cathedral. When the cathedral, begun in 1137, was ready for consecration the relics of St Magnus were transferred there.

===Sweyn Asleifsson and Earl Rögnavald===

As this part of the saga was written only a few decades after Asleifsson&#x27;s death it is reasonable to suppose these chapters more accurately reflect the events they describe than the histories of earlier times. Asleifsson is depicted as the quintessential Viking, a freebooter whose activities include drunkenness, murder and plundering and whose support is crucial to the politics of the Orkney earldom. Although he was not an earl his activities take up fully one quarter of the saga and the oldest version ends with his death.

His tale is closely bound up with that of Earl Rögnvald, a more rounded character who is also a troubadour and, like his uncle Magnus, ultimately a saint, and it may be that the saga writers were seeking to portray them as exemplars of the Viking lifestyle. However, there may also be a more complex moral to the story. Although Ásleifsson&#x27;s dying words are &quot;Be it known to all men... that I belong to the bodyguard of Saint Rögnvald the Earl&quot;, he also blackmailed Rögnvald and caused him a great deal of trouble. It is possible that the saga intends to cast Rögnvald as a weak leader who was unable control his nobles.

Another interpretation of the narrative is that rather than seeing these two men as protagonist and antagonist that together they live in a golden age where the earl is a cultured ruler and &quot;primus inter pares&quot; but who owes his position in part to his band of &quot;worthy warriors&quot; and is by no means a despot who rules by divine right. In this case the whole story may be seen as a reaction to the Norwegian royal propaganda of the age that sought to promote the central authority of the crown.

If the height of the earls&#x27; military strength was during the 11th century time of Thorfinn &quot;the Mighty&quot;, the reign of Earl Rögnvald Kali Kolson marks the 12th century cultural high point of the saga.

===Later Earls===
Earl Harald &quot;the Old&quot; Maddadsson (c. 1134 – 1206) ruled jointly with Earl Rognvald for part of his long tenure. When King Eystein Haraldsson undertook a raiding expedition from Norway against Orkney he encountered Harald near Thurso and captured him. Harald was freed in return for a ransom in gold and by giving his oath to Eystein. Eystein then went on to raid the coasts of Scotland and England.

Possibly as a result of Eystein&#x27;s activities, King David I granted half of Caithness to Harald&#x27;s cousin, Erlend Haraldsson. The result was a political struggle which ended with Erlend&#x27;s murder in 1154. Sweyn Asleifsson was again heavily involved in this dynastic conflict. In 1153 King David died and was succeeded by his young grandson, Malcolm IV. King Eystein too died in a war with his brothers Ingi and Sigurd. As a result, by 1158 Harald Maddadsson was undisputed Earl of Orkney, with neither the King of Scots nor the King of Norway in a position to contest his power.

The final, brief chapters of the later version of the saga depict the lives of Harald&#x27;s four successors who ruled until the murder of Jon Haraldsson in 1231, bringing the line of specifically Norse earls of Orkney to an end although Orkney and Shetland remained part of Norway until the 15th century.

==History or fable?==

There is clearly doubt about the historicity of many of the claims in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; and the extent to which euhemerism may be an appropriate approach. Just as the backdrop to the supposed great expedition to the west undertaken by King Harald Fairhair that led to the founding of the Orkney earldom was the mid-13th century Norwegian contest with the Kings of Scots over the Hebrides, so also events that have been included in the saga as embellishments to the life of Earl Thorfinn have a number of parallels with the life of Harald Maddadsson. Woolf (2007) speculates that aspects of Thorfinn&#x27;s story may have been included to legitimise the latter&#x27;s adventures.

Early in the narrative in particular, there are examples of obviously fictional elements such as Earl Sigurd&#x27;s raven banner and also in some later events such as the effects of the poisoned shirt that supposedly killed Earl Harald Haakonsson. Furthermore, there is the regular use of standard Norse dramatic sitations. For example, the story of the killing of Rognvald Brusason by Earl Thorfinn &quot;is saga-fiction, and it contains some stock-episodes which are repeated elsewhere in the saga&quot;. Another example of the saga writer&#x27;s fictional devices is found in the tale of Haakon Paulsson&#x27;s travels through Scandinavia where he meets a fortune teller. The sooth-sayer&#x27;s predictions are in effect a &quot;table of contents&quot; for his later travails with his cousin Magnus and an example of &quot;the frequent need to disentangle the historical Magnus from the saga&#x27;s story-telling techniques&quot;.

However, there are also examples of events depicted in the saga that have been thought of as essentially fictional, but have later been shown to have some basis in fact. For example, towards the end of his reign as earl, Sigurd Eysteinsson is said to have challenged a native ruler, Máel Brigte the Bucktoothed, to a 40-man-a-side battle. Treacherously, Sigurd brought 80 men to the fight and Máel Brigte was defeated and beheaded. Sigurd strapped the head to his saddle as a trophy, but as Sigurd rode home, Máel Brigte&#x27;s buck-tooth scratched his leg. The leg became inflamed and infected, and as a result Sigurd died. He was buried in a tumulus known as Sigurd&#x27;s Howe, or &quot;Sigurðar-haugr&quot;. The location of Sigurd&#x27;s Howe is most probably modern-day Sidera or Cyderhall near Dornoch, which discovery was not made until the late 19th century. Another example concerns a King of Scots, apparently named Karl Hundason.

===Who was Karl Hundason?===
The identity of Karl Hundason, unknown to Scots and Irish sources, has long been a matter of dispute. His existence rests solely on the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, and more particularly on those elements of &quot;Þórfinnsdrápa&quot; which are preserved within it.

Robertson (1862) proposed that Hundason should be identified with Duncan I. William Forbes Skene suggested that Karl (or Kali) Hundason should be identified with &quot;Malcolm MacKenneth&quot;, a son of Kenneth III. Another candidate is MacBeth whose father may be called &quot;jarl Hundi&quot; in &quot;Njál&#x27;s saga&quot;. Woolf (2007) proposes that Hundason, rather that being some hitherto unknown Scots king, was the son of Thorfinn&#x27;s brother Hundi. However, Thomson (2008) notes that both the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; and &quot;St Olaf&#x27;s saga&quot; suggest Hundi only lived &quot;a short while&quot; and was unlikely to have had a son himself. Anderson (1990) suggested that this is &quot;a fabulous story&quot; and concluded that &quot;[n]o solution to the riddle seems to be justified&quot;.

Muir (2005) points out that a literal translation of &quot;Karl Hundisson&quot; is &quot;peasant son-of-a-dog&quot;, an insult that would have been obvious to Norse-speakers hearing the saga and that &quot;we can assume this wasn&#x27;t his real name&quot;. The implication is that there is no purpose in seeking phonetic parallels with known Scots personages. Thomson points out that both &quot;Karl&quot; and Hundi&quot; are names used in other contexts without disparaging intentions although the combination is otherwise unknown.

Thomson also notes that the war with Hundasson seem to have taken place between 1029 and 1035 and that the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; record the violent death of Gillacomgain, son of Mael Brigte and Mormaer of Moray in 1032. He too is thus a candidate for Thorfinn&#x27;s Scots foe—and the manner of his death by fire bears comparison with Arnór&#x27;s poetic description of the aftermath of the battle at Torfness.

Whoever Karl son of Hundi may have been, it appears that the saga is reporting a local conflict with a Scots ruler of Moray or Ross:[T]he whole narrative is consistent with the idea that the struggle of Thorfinn and Karl is a continuation of that which had been waged since the ninth century by the Orkney earls, notably Sigurd Rognvald&#x27;s son, Ljot, and Sigurd the Stout, against the princes or &quot;mormaers&quot; of Moray, Sutherland, Ross, and Argyll, and that, in fine, Malcolm and Karl were &quot;mormaers&quot; of one of these four provinces.

It is therefore entirely possible that Thorfinn&#x27;s campaign was not fought against the Scottish crown as such but that rather the Scots may have been his allies in a struggle they both had against the power of Moray.

==Themes==

===Gender===
It is evident that the main characters of the saga are the exclusively male jarls and kings and their male supporters and antagonists. Nonetheless, it is believed that women enjoyed a relatively high status during the Viking Age, possibly due to the high degree of mobility in society and they regularly appear in supporting roles. Amongst them are Gunnhild &quot;Mother of Kings&quot; Gormsdóttir; Ingibiorg &quot;the Earls&#x27;-mother&quot; Finnsdottir, wife of Earl Thorfinn; Frakokk, whose poisoned shirt was involved in the death of her nephew Earl Harald Haakonsson; Helga Moddansdottir, sister of Frakkok and mother of Ingibjörg Hakonsdóttir who married King Olaf Godredsson; and Gunnhild, sister of Magnus Erlendsson and mother of Earl Rognvald. On the other hand, the idea of &quot;courtly love&quot; plays a much more prominent part in the literature of continental Europe for the same period than in the sagas in general.

===Orkney and Norway===
Woolf (2007) argues that the &quot;saga’s main theme, in so far as it can be said to have one, seems to have been to tie in the history of the earldom with that of the kings of Norway and to establish clearly the history of the relationships between the two polities.&quot; Crawford (1987) observes several sub-themes: &quot;of submission and of overlordship; the problem of dual allegiance and the threat of the earls looking to the kings of Scots as an alternative source of support; the Norwegian kings&#x27; use of hostages; and their general aim of attempting to turn the Orkney earls into royal officials bound to them by oaths of homage, and returning tribute to them on a regular basis.&quot;

An example is the passing of the title of Earl of Orkney from Rognvald Eysteinsson, who received it from the Norwegian crown, to his brother Sigurd. The notion that Rognvald could hand over his title in this way has been interpreted in various ways. It may be that Rognvald considered the gift from the king as a mixed blessing, but this is an instance in which the writer of the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; attempts to reconcile the conflicting themes of independence from Norway (Rognvald gifts the islands to Sigurd) and dependence on royal authority (King Harald formalises the process by confirming Sigurd as earl). Beuermann (2011) speculates that Rognvald&#x27;s transfer of power to his brother may have been an attempt by the saga writers to imply that the Orkney earldom had more independence from Norway than that of Rognvald&#x27;s earldom of Møre and that the earl&#x27;s holdings in Caithness may have allowed for an even greater degree of freedom of action. Such implications are more likely to be rooted in the writer&#x27;s interest in emphasising Orcadian independence at the time of writing rather than the 9th/10th century events they purport to describe.

Similarly, the story of Torf-Einar in the next generation touches on this theme. The writer of the saga established Einarr&#x27;s status in two contradictory ways. Although in the &quot;Historia Norvegia&quot; Rognvald of Møre&#x27;s family are described as &quot;pirates&quot; the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; provides them with a legally established earldom instated by the king. On the other hand, Einarr success is largely down to his own efforts and he negotiates with King Harald rather than offers blind obedience. The author is thus able to emphasise both the legitimacy and independence of his house.

===Kinstrife===
Joint earldoms were a frequent feature of the Norse earldom and Thomson (2008) identifies a different intention at the heart of the saga. This joint rulership was &quot;inherently unstable and usually ended in violence&quot;. He identifies these family feuds as being the main theme, culminating in the martyrdom of St Magnus c.1115, and that the writer is emphasising the doom of &quot;kin-slaying&quot;. Examples include the fratricidal strife that engulfed the sons of Earl Thorfinn in which they were abetted by Ragnhild Eriksdotter, the deaths of Einar Sigurdsson and his nephew Rognvald Brusason at the hands of Thorkel Fosterer, the henchman of Thorfinn as well as the homicidal dispute between the cousins Haakon Paulsson and Magnus Erlendsson itself that led to the latter&#x27;s canonisation. Indeed, the rivalry between the two families that Paul and Erlend founded were still alive four generations later when the &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; was written down.

Although the saga frequently mentions placenames it is largely silent on the subject of how the joint earldoms functioned on a geographical basis. It is possible that Brusi Sigurdsson&#x27;s share, described as the &quot;northernmost part of the isles&quot;, was those islands lying north of the Orkney mainland, that his brother Einar &quot;Wry-mouth&quot; Sigurdsson&#x27;s was originally the east Mainland and the south isles and that Sumarlidi Sigurdsson&#x27;s was the west Mainland. However, it is also possible that Brusi&#x27;s share was Shetland, which formed part of the earldom throughout the Norse period. This possibility is supported by a later reference to his son Rognvald as &quot;Lord of the Shetlanders&quot; and Thompson (2008) is in &quot;no doubt &quot; that Shetland was in Brusi&#x27;s possession. It is likely that Fair Isle marked the boundary between these shares both then and during later joint earldoms.

===Religion and morality===

The accuracy with which the saga addresses the conversion of Orkney and Shetland to Christianity has been touched on above and the weight of archaeological evidence suggests that Christian burial was already widespread in Orkney by Sigurd Hlodvirsson&#x27;s time. The intention may have been to disown the influence of indigenous elements of Orcadian and Shetland culture (such as the existence of this religion prior to the arrival of the Norse) and emphasise that positive cultural developments came from Scandinavia, whilst at the same time critiquing the unduly blunt method of Norwegian interference in this case.

The inclusion of the tale of the raven banner in the saga material may convey the idea of a revival of heathenism in Orcadian society and a reaction to Norwegian attempts to control the islands. However, in the &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; there is a vivid contrast between Sigurd&#x27;s death clutching the raven banner and the later career of his son Thorfinn, who is credited with several achievements in bringing Orkney into mainstream Christendom. Taken as a whole the intention may be to draw attention to this transition.

Rögnvald Kali Kolsson&#x27;s pilgrimage to Jerusalem has a different flavour from the politicking and violence that permeates much of the rest of the saga. There are romantic touches and the earl&#x27;s poetry is emphasised. There is a case for regarding this episode as the &quot;central quest&quot; of the saga and the poetry emphasises some of the contradictions at the heart of the medieval Orcadian world. Society is both pagan and Christian, violence goes hand-in-hand with maganimity, kinstrife is frequent yet &quot;the bonds of sworn friendship cannot be broken&quot;.

===Other elements===
Another recurring theme in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; is raiding in the Hebrides, which is touched on during the saga&#x27;s coverage of Rognvald Eysteinsson&#x27;s life and times in the earliest part of the story and on several other occasions up to the last chapters and Sweyn Asleifsson&#x27;s exploits. Remarkably, neither the &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; nor any other Kings&#x27; Sagas refers to the Irish Sea campaign by Magnus Haraldsson in 1058, which is the first such event attested in contemporary sources in the British Isles. The authors of the sagas may have believed these events were easily confused with Magnus Barefoot&#x27;s later invasion and that as the earlier Magnus had no royal descendants at the time the stories were committed to writing no-one of importance would lose face by omitting them. Woolf (2007) suggests this shortcoming in the historical record &quot;serves as a warning&quot; about the saga&#x27;s reliability in general.

At the time the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; was first written down Haakon Paulsson&#x27;s grandson, Harald Maddadsson, was Earl of Orkney and the writer clearly had some difficulty in portraying the kin-slaying of Magnus Erlendsson. Thomson (2008) concludes that the &quot;assembly&quot; that sentenced Magnus was either invented or heavily emphasised in order to &quot;divert some of the blame from Hakon&quot;. Furthermore, in reporting on Earl Haakon&#x27;s death the saga reports that this was &quot;felt to be a great loss, his later years having been very peaceful&quot;. Commenting on the complex relationship between history and invention in the saga Joseph Anderson wrote:When great events and mighty deeds were preserved for posterity by oral recitation alone, it was necessary that the memory should be enabled to retain its hold of the elements of the story by some extraneous artistic aid, and therefore they were welded by the wordsmith’s rhymes into a compact and homogenous &quot;lay&quot;. Thus, worked into the poetical setting (as the jeweler mounts his gems to enhance their value and ensure their preservation), they passed as heirlooms from generation to generation, floating on the oral tradition of the people&quot;.

There are therefore many facets to this saga and, in part at least, its purpose was to &quot;explore such social and psychological tensions as these in the history of the people of Orkney, and to help them understand themselves through a knowledge of their origins&quot;.

==Modern significance==
The saga is not only of importance to scholars attempting to understand the Viking Age in the islands and their neighbouring lands, it is also plays a significant part in the modern culture of the Northern Isles. The vivid stories of life in Scandinavian Scotland invite the &quot;people of Orkney and Shetland to recognise themselves as the inheritors and custodians of a dual culture, both Norse and Scottish&quot;.

==Popular culture==
&quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; served as inspiration for several modern novels, including Eric Linklater&#x27;s &quot;The Men of Ness&quot; (1932), George Mackay Brown&#x27;s &quot;Magnus&quot; (1973), and Linnea Hartsuyker&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Wolf Saga&quot;, a trilogy consisting of &quot;The Half-Drowned King&quot; (2017), &quot;The Sea Queen&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Golden Wolf&quot; (2019).

<text>Greenwich ( , , ) is an area in south-east London, England, within the ceremonial county of Greater London, east-south-east of Charing Cross.

Greenwich is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. The town became the site of a royal palace, the Palace of Placentia, from the 15th century and was the birthplace of many Tudors, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was demolished, eventually being replaced by the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors, designed by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor. These buildings became the Royal Naval College in 1873, and they remained a military education establishment until 1998, when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation. The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public; other buildings are used by the University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance.

The town became a popular resort in the 18th century, and many grand houses were built there, such as Vanbrugh Castle (1717) established on Maze Hill, next to the park. From the Georgian period estates of houses were constructed above the town centre. The maritime connections of Greenwich were celebrated in the 20th century, with the siting of the historic vessels &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; and &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; next to the river front, and the National Maritime Museum in the former buildings of the Royal Hospital School in 1934.

Historically an ancient parish in the Blackheath Hundred of Kent, the town formed part of the growing conurbation of London in the 19th century. When the County of London, an administrative area designed to replace the Metropolitan Board of Works, was formed in 1889, the parish merged with those of Charlton-next-Woolwich, Deptford St Nicholas and Kidbrooke to create the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich. When local government in London was again reformed in 1965, it merged with most of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich, creating what is now the Royal Borough of Greenwich, a local authority district of Greater London.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The place-name &#x27;Greenwich&#x27; is first attested in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 918, where it appears as &quot;Gronewic&quot;. It is recorded as &quot;Grenewic&quot; in 964, and as &quot;Grenawic&quot; in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 1013. It is &quot;Grenviz&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, and &quot;Grenewych&quot; in the &quot;Taxatio Ecclesiastica&quot; of 1291. The name means &#x27;green &quot;wic&quot;&#x27;, indicating that Greenwich was what is known as a -wich town or emporium, from the Latin &#x27;vicus&#x27;.

The settlement later became known as &quot;East Greenwich&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;West Greenwich&quot; or &quot;Deptford Strond&quot;, the part of Deptford adjacent to the River Thames, but the use of &quot;East Greenwich&quot; to mean the whole of the town of Greenwich died out in the 19th century. However, Greenwich was divided into the registration subdistricts of &quot;Greenwich East&quot; and &quot;Greenwich West&quot; from the beginning of civil registration in 1837, the boundary running down what is now Greenwich Church Street and Croom&#x27;s Hill, although more modern references to &quot;&quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot;&quot; Greenwich probably refer to the areas east and west of the Royal Naval College and National Maritime Museum corresponding with the West Greenwich council ward. An article in &quot;The Times&quot; of 13 October 1967 stated:

&quot;East Greenwich&quot;, gateway to the Blackwall Tunnel, remains solidly working class, the manpower for one eighth of London&#x27;s heavy industry. &quot;West Greenwich&quot; is a hybrid: the spirit of Nelson, the &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;, the Maritime Museum, an industrial waterfront and a number of elegant houses, ripe for development.
====Manor of East Greenwich====
Royal charters granted to English colonists in North America, as well as in Company Bombay and St Helena, often used the name of the manor of East Greenwich for describing the tenure (from the Latin verb &quot;teneo&quot;, hold) as that of free socage. New England charters provided that the grantees should hold their lands &quot;as of his Majesty&#x27;s manor of East Greenwich&quot;. This was in relation to the principle of land tenure under English law, that the ruling monarch (king or queen) was paramount lord of all the soil in the &quot;terra regis&quot;, while all others held their lands, directly or indirectly, under the monarch. Land outside the physical boundaries of England, as in America, was treated as belonging constructively to one of the existing royal manors, and from Tudor times grants frequently used the name of the manor of East Greenwich, but some 17th-century grants named the castle of Windsor. Places in North America that have taken the name &quot;East Greenwich&quot; include a township in Gloucester County, New Jersey, a hamlet in Washington County, New York, and a town in Kent County, Rhode Island. Greenwich, Connecticut was also named after Greenwich.

===Early settlement===

Tumuli to the south-west of Flamsteed House, in Greenwich Park, are thought to be early Bronze Age barrows re-used by the Saxons in the 6th century as burial grounds. To the east between the Vanbrugh and Maze Hill Gates is the site of a Roman villa or temple. A small area of red paving tesserae protected by railings marks the spot. It was excavated in 1902, and 300 coins were found dating from the emperors Claudius and Honorius to the 5th century. This was excavated by the Channel 4 television programme &quot;Time Team&quot; in 1999, broadcast in 2000, and further investigations were made by the same group in 2003.

The Roman road from London to Dover, Watling Street, crossed the high ground to the south of Greenwich, through Blackheath. This followed the line of an earlier Celtic route from Canterbury to St Albans. As late as Henry V, Greenwich was only a fishing town, with a safe anchorage in the river.

===Viking===
During the reign of Ethelred the Unready, the Danish fleet anchored in the River Thames off Greenwich for over three years, and the army encamped on the hill above. From here they attacked Kent and, in the year 1012, took the city of Canterbury, making Archbishop Alphege their prisoner for seven months in their camp at Greenwich, at that time within the county of Kent. They stoned him to death for his refusal to allow his ransom (3,000 pieces of silver) to be paid; and kept his body, until the blossoming of a stick that had been immersed in his blood. For this miracle his body was released to his followers, he achieved sainthood for his martyrdom and, in the 12th century, the parish church was dedicated to him. The present church on the site west of the town centre is St Alfege&#x27;s Church, designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor in 1714 and completed in 1718.

===Norman===
The Domesday Book of 1086 records the manor of &quot;Grenviz&quot; in the hundred of &quot;Grenviz&quot; as held by Bishop Odo of Bayeux; his lands were seized by the crown in 1082. The name of the hundred was changed to Blackheath when the site of the hundred court was moved there in the 12th century. There has been a royal palace or hunting lodge here since before 1300, when Edward I is known to have made offerings at the chapel of the Virgin Mary.

===Plantagenet===
Subsequent monarchs were regular visitors, with Henry IV making his will here, and Henry V granting the manor, for life, to Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, who died at Greenwich in 1426. The palace was created by Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, Henry V&#x27;s younger brother and regent to his son Henry VI in 1447; he enclosed the park and erected a tower (Greenwich Castle) on the hill now occupied by the Royal Observatory. The Thames-side palace was renamed the Palace of Placentia or Pleasaunce by Henry VI&#x27;s consort Margaret of Anjou after Humphrey&#x27;s death. The palace was completed and further enlarged by Edward IV, and in 1466 it was granted to his queen, Elizabeth. Edward IV had previously been given permission by the Pope to establish a Franciscan friary of Observant Friars in Greenwich, this was done in 1485, two years after his death; the first Observant House in England, it was located on land adjacent to the palace. After rejecting papal authority in 1534, the Franciscan Observants were suppressed; refounded as Franciscan Conventual, the friary was dissolved in 1538, then re-established in 1555 for Observants, before the friars were finally expelled in 1559 and the friary was demolished in 1662.

Ultimately it was because the palace and its grounds were a royal possession (with a useful hill) that it was chosen as the site for Charles II&#x27;s Royal Observatory, from which stemmed Greenwich&#x27;s subsequent global role as originator of the modern Prime Meridian.

=== Tudor ===
The palace was the principal residence of Henry VII whose sons Henry (later Henry VIII) and Edmund Tudor were born here, and baptised in St Alphege&#x27;s. Henry favoured Greenwich over nearby Eltham Palace, the former principal royal palace in south London, which was not on the River Thames and so was less accessible. Henry extended Greenwich Palace and it became his principal London seat until Whitehall Palace was built in the 1530s. Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves at Greenwich, and both of his daughters, Mary (18 February 1516) and Elizabeth (7 September 1533), were born at Greenwich. His son Edward VI also died there at age 15.

The palace of Placentia, in turn, became Elizabeth&#x27;s favourite summer residence. Both she and her sister Mary used the palace extensively, and Elizabeth&#x27;s Council planned the Spanish Armada campaign there in 1588.

=== Stuart ===

James I carried out the final remodelling work on Greenwich Palace, granting the manor to his wife Queen Anne of Denmark. In 1616 Anne commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build the surviving Queen&#x27;s House as the final addition to the palace.

Charles I granted the manor to his wife Queen Henrietta Maria, for whom Inigo Jones completed the Queen&#x27;s House. During the English Civil War, the palace was used as a biscuit factory and prisoner-of-war camp. Then, in the Interregnum, the palace and park were seized to become a &#x27;mansion&#x27; for the Lord Protector.

By the time of the Restoration, the Palace of Placentia had fallen into disuse and was pulled down. New buildings began to be established as a grand palace for Charles II, but only the King Charles block was completed. Charles II also redesigned and replanted Greenwich Park and founded and built the Royal Observatory.

Prince James (later King James II &amp; VII), as Duke of York and Lord High Admiral until 1673, was often at Greenwich with his brother Charles and, according to Samuel Pepys, he proposed the idea of creating a Royal Naval Hospital. This was eventually established at Greenwich by his daughter Mary II, who in 1692–1693 commissioned Christopher Wren to design the Royal Hospital for Seamen (now the Old Royal Naval College). The work was begun under her widower William III in 1696 and completed by Hawksmoor. Queen Anne and Prince George of Denmark continued to patronise the project.

=== Hanoverian ===

George I landed at Greenwich from Hanover on his accession in 1714. His successor George II granted the Royal Hospital for Seamen the forfeited estates of the Jacobite Earl of Derwentwater, which allowed the building to be completed by 1751.

In 1805, George III granted the Queen&#x27;s House to the Royal Naval Asylum (an orphanage school), which amalgamated in 1821–1825 with the Greenwich Hospital School. Extended with the buildings that now house the National Maritime Museum, it was renamed the Royal Hospital School by Queen Victoria in 1892.

George IV donated nearly 40 paintings to the hospital in 1824, at a stroke creating a gallery in the Painted Hall. These now form the Greenwich Hospital Collection at the National Maritime Museum. Subsequently, William IV and Queen Adelaide were both regular donors and visitors to the gallery.

===Victorian and Edwardian ===

Queen Victoria rarely visited Greenwich, but in 1845 her husband Prince Albert personally bought Nelson&#x27;s Trafalgar coat for the Naval Gallery.

In 1838 the London and Greenwich Railway (L&amp;GR) completed the first steam railway in London. It started at London Bridge and had its terminus at London Street (now Greenwich High Road). It was also the first to be built specifically for passengers, and the first elevated railway, having 878 arches over its almost four mile stretch. South of the railway&#x27;s viaduct over Deptford Creek is a Victorian pumping station constructed in 1864 as part of Joseph Bazalgette&#x27;s London sewerage system (the Southern Outfall Sewer flows under Greenwich town centre).

In 1853 the local Scottish Presbyterian community built a church, St Mark&#x27;s, nearby which was extended twice in the 1860s during the ministry of Adolph Saphir, eventually accommodating 1,000 worshippers.

In 1864 opposite the railway terminus, theatrical entrepreneur Sefton Parry built the thousand-seater New Greenwich Theatre. William Morton was one of its more successful managers. The theatre was demolished in 1937 to make way for a new Town Hall, now a listed building under new ownership and renamed Meridian House.
Greenwich Station is at the northern apex of the Ashburnham Triangle, a residential estate developed by the Ashburnham family, mainly between 1830 and 1870, on land previously developed as market gardens. It is now a designated conservation area. The present Greenwich Theatre, further to the east, on Croom&#x27;s Hill, was constructed inside the shell of a Victorian music hall. Beginning life in 1855 as an annexe to the Rose and Crown, the music hall was rebuilt in 1871 by Charles Crowder and subsequently operated under many names. Further south on Croom&#x27;s Hill, the Roman Catholic church of Our Ladye Star of the Sea was opened in 1851.

The meridian was established in 1851.

=== Modern and the present ===
George V and his wife Queen Mary both supported the creation of the National Maritime Museum, and Mary presented the museum with many items.

Prince Albert, Duke of York (later George VI), laid the foundation stone of the new Royal Hospital School when it moved out to Holbrook, Suffolk. In 1937 his first public act as king, three weeks before his coronation, was to open the National Maritime Museum in the buildings vacated by the school. The king was accompanied by his mother Queen Mary, his wife Queen Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) and Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II.)

Princess Elizabeth and her consort Prince Philip, who had been ennobled Duke of Edinburgh and Baron Greenwich on marriage in 1947, made their first public and official visit to Greenwich in 1948 to receive the Freedom of the Borough for Philip. In the same year, he became a trustee of the National Maritime Museum. Prince Philip was a trustee for 52 years until 2000, when he became its first patron. The Duke of Edinburgh was also a patron of the &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; (which was opened by the Queen in 1957) from 1952.

During the Silver Jubilee of 1977, the Queen embarked at Greenwich for the Jubilee River Pageant. In 1987, she was aboard the P&amp;O ship &quot;Pacific Princess&quot; when it moored alongside the Old Royal Naval College for the company&#x27;s 150th-anniversary celebrations.

To mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, on 3 February 2012 the Borough of Greenwich became the fourth London Borough to have Royal Borough status, the others being the Kingston upon Thames, the Kensington and Chelsea and the Windsor and Maidenhead. The status was granted in recognition of the borough&#x27;s historic links with the monarchy, the location of the Prime Meridian and its being a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Governance==

Greenwich is covered by the Greenwich West and Peninsula wards of the London Borough of Greenwich, which was formed in 1965 by merging the former Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich with that part of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich which lay south of the River Thames. Along with Blackheath Westcombe, Charlton, Glyndon, Woolwich Riverside, and Woolwich Common, it elects a Member of Parliament (MP) for Greenwich and Woolwich; Matthew Pennycook was elected as its MP in 2015 and later elections.

==Geography==

===Geography of Greenwich===
The town of Greenwich is built on a broad platform to the south of the outside of a broad meander in the River Thames, with a safe deep water anchorage lying in the river. To the south, the land rises steeply, through Greenwich Park to the town of Blackheath. The higher areas consist of a sedimentary layer of gravelly soils, known as the &quot;Blackheath Beds&quot;, that spread through much of the south-east over a chalk outcrop—with sands, loam and seams of clay at the lower levels by the river.

Greenwich is bordered by Deptford Creek and Deptford to the west; the residential area of Westcombe Park to the east; the River Thames to the north; and the A2 and Blackheath to the south. The Greenwich Peninsula, northeast of the town centre and also known as North Greenwich, forms the main projection of the town.

===Climate===
This data was collected between 2005 and 2015 at the weather station in Greenwich:

Historically, the record high is on 9 August 1911. This was the record for London until 2003, though it was disregarded due to non-standard instruments.

Greenwich has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with warm summers and cool winters.

==Sites of interest==
===Riverfront===

The &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; (a clipper ship) has been preserved in a dry dock by the river. A major fire in May 2007 destroyed a part of the ship, although much had already been removed for restoration. Nearby for many years was also displayed &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot;, the yacht sailed by Sir Francis Chichester in his single-handed, 226-day circumnavigation of the globe during 1966–67. In 2004, &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; was removed from Greenwich, and after restoration work completed a second circumnavigation in May 2007. On the riverside in front of the north-west corner of the hospital is an obelisk erected in memory of Arctic explorer Joseph René Bellot.

Near the Cutty Sark site, a circular building contains the entrance to the Greenwich foot tunnel, opened on 4 August 1902. This connects Greenwich to the Isle of Dogs on the northern side of the River Thames. The north exit of the tunnel is at Island Gardens, from where the famous view of Greenwich Hospital painted by Canaletto can be seen.

Rowing has been part of life on the river at Greenwich for hundreds of years and the first Greenwich Regatta was held in 1785. The annual Great River Race along the Thames Tideway finishes at the Cutty Sark. The nearby Trafalgar Rowing Centre in Crane Street is home to Curlew and Globe rowing clubs.

The Old Royal Naval College is Sir Christopher Wren&#x27;s domed masterpiece at the centre of the heritage site. The site is administered by the Greenwich Foundation and several of the buildings are let to the University of Greenwich and one, the King Charles block, to Trinity College of Music. Within the complex is the former college dining room, the Painted Hall, this was painted by James Thornhill, and the Chapel of St Peter and St Paul, with an interior designed by James &#x27;Athenian&#x27; Stuart. The Naval College had a training reactor, the JASON reactor, within the King William building that was operational between 1962 and 1996. The reactor was decommissioned and removed in 1999.
To the east of the Naval College is the Trinity Hospital almshouse, founded in 1613, the oldest surviving building in the town centre. This is next to the massive brick walls and the landing stage of Greenwich Power Station. Built between 1902 and 1910 as a coal-fired station to supply power to London&#x27;s tram system, and later the London underground, it is now oil- and gas-powered and serves as a backup station for London Underground. East Greenwich also has a small park, East Greenwich Pleasaunce, which was formerly the burial ground of Greenwich Hospital.

The O2 (formerly the Millennium Dome) was built on part of the site of East Greenwich Gas Works, a disused British Gas site on the Greenwich Peninsula. It is next to North Greenwich Underground station, about north east from the Greenwich town centre, north west of Charlton. Pear Tree Wharf was associated with the gas works, being used to unload coal for the manufacturing of town gas, and is now home to the Greenwich Yacht Club. The Greenwich Millennium Village is a modern urban regeneration development to the south of the Dome. Enderby&#x27;s Wharf is a site associated with submarine cable manufacture for over 150 years.

===Greenwich Park===

South of the former Naval College is the National Maritime Museum housed in buildings forming another symmetrical group and grand arcade incorporating the Queen&#x27;s House, designed by Inigo Jones. Continuing to the south, Greenwich Park is a Royal Park of , laid out in the 17th century and formed from the hunting grounds of the Royal Palace of Placentia.

The park rises towards Blackheath and at the top of this hill is a statue of James Wolfe, commander of the British expedition to capture Quebec. Nearby a major group of buildings within the park includes the former Royal Observatory, Greenwich; the Prime Meridian passes through this building.

Greenwich Mean Time was at one time based on the time observations made at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, before being superseded by the closely related Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). While there is no longer a working astronomical observatory at Greenwich, a ball still drops daily to mark the exact moment of 1 p.m., and there is a museum of astronomical and navigational tools, particularly John Harrison&#x27;s marine chronometers.

The Ranger&#x27;s House lies at the Blackheath end of the park and houses the Wernher Collection of art, and many fine houses, including Vanbrugh&#x27;s house lie on Maze Hill, on the western edge of the park.

===Town centre===

Around the covered Greenwich Market, Georgian and Victorian architecture dominates in the town centre which spreads to the west of the park and Royal Naval College. Up the hill from the centre, there are many streets of Georgian houses, including the Fan Museum, on Croom&#x27;s Hill. Nearby, at the junction of Croom&#x27;s Hill with Nevada Street, is Greenwich Theatre; at the eastern end of Nevada Street is the Greenwich Tavern. To the west, the arthouse Greenwich Cinema is on Greenwich High Road, while the nearby Greenwich Playhouse closed in 2012.

====Market====

There has been a market at Greenwich since the 14th century, but the history of the present market dates from 1700 when a charter to run two markets, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, was assigned by Lord Romney (Henry, Earl of Romney) to the Commissioners of Greenwich Hospital for 1000 years.

The market is part of &quot;the island site&quot;, bounded by College Approach, Greenwich Church Street, King William Walk and Nelson Road, near the National Maritime Museum and the Royal Observatory. The buildings surrounding the market are Grade 2 listed and were established in 1827–1833 under the direction of Joseph Kay. A market roof was added in 1902–1908 (and replaced in 2016). Later significant development occurred in 1958–1960 and during the 1980s.

The landowner, Greenwich Hospital, enhanced the market between 2014 and early 2016. Following the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 the rents for several of the market stalls were increased by up to 60% as Greenwich Hospital&#x27;s managing agent Knight Frank said it was losing money with fewer stalls operating and only four days of trading a week.

===Millennium Leisure Park===

About east of Greenwich town centre, the Millennium Leisure Park is an out-of-town retail park on Bugsby&#x27;s Way in east Greenwich. It consists of retail outlets (IKEA and B&amp;Q), restaurants and an Odeon cinema. The IKEA store here opened in 2019 as the retailer&#x27;s fourth main store in London, following stores in Wembley (1988), Croydon (1992) and Tottenham (2005); the Greenwich store is the first in Inner London.

Greenwich Shopping Park is about further east, in Charlton.

==Greenwich Mean Time==
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is a term originally referring to mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, which overlooks the River Thames from a hill in Greenwich Park. GMT is commonly used in practice to refer to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when this is viewed as a time zone, especially by bodies connected with the United Kingdom, such as the BBC World Service, the Royal Navy, the Met Office and others, although strictly UTC is an atomic time scale which only approximates GMT with a tolerance of 0.9 second. It is also used to refer to Universal Time (UT), which is a standard astronomical concept used in many technical fields and is often referred to by the military in the phrase Zulu time.

As the United Kingdom grew into an advanced maritime nation, British mariners kept at least one chronometer on GMT in order to calculate their longitude from the Greenwich meridian, which was by convention considered to have longitude zero degrees (this convention was internationally adopted in the International Meridian Conference of 1884). The synchronization of the chronometer on GMT did not affect shipboard time itself, which was still solar time. But this practice, combined with mariners from other nations drawing from Nevil Maskelyne&#x27;s method of lunar distances based on observations at Greenwich, eventually led to GMT being used worldwide as a reference time independent of location. Most time zones were based upon this reference as a number of hours and half-hours &quot;ahead of GMT&quot; or &quot;behind GMT&quot;.

In recognition of the suburb&#x27;s astronomical links, Asteroid 2830 has been named &#x27;Greenwich&#x27;.

==World Heritage Site==

In 1997 Maritime Greenwich was added to the list of World Heritage Sites, for the concentration and quality of buildings of historic and architectural interest. These can be divided into the group of buildings along the riverfront, Greenwich Park and the Georgian and Victorian town centre.

==Discover Greenwich Visitor Centre==

The Discover Greenwich Visitor Centre provides an introduction to the history and attractions in the Greenwich World Heritage Site. It is in The Pepys Building near to the &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; within the grounds of the Old Royal Naval College (formerly Greenwich Hospital); the building began life as an engineering laboratory for the college. The centre opened in March 2010, and admission is free.

The Centre explains the history of Greenwich as a royal residence and a maritime centre. Exhibits include:
* The history of the Palace of Placentia.
* Models of Christopher Wren&#x27;s original designs for Greenwich Hospital.
* Six of the carved heads originally intended to decorate the exterior of the college&#x27;s Painted Hall.
* Exhibition displays about Maritime Greenwich and its connections with the sea and exploration.
* &quot;By Wisdom as much as War&quot; – an exhibition about the history of the Royal Naval College during the years it occupied Greenwich Hospital (1873–1998).

==Education==
The University of Greenwich main campus occupies most of the grand, landmark riverside vista buildings of the former Royal Naval College. The university has other campuses at Avery Hill in Eltham and at Medway. The Greenwich campus also houses the Trinity College of Music.

Ravensbourne University London is located on the Greenwich Peninsula and offers courses related to art and design. Its campus was designed by architect Farshid Moussavi. 

Secondary schools in the area include The John Roan School, founded 1677, and St Ursula&#x27;s Convent School, established 1850.

<text>In Hawaiian religion, Lua-o-Milu is the land of the dead, ruled by Milu. Entrance to Lua-o-Milu is from the top of a valley wall or sea cliff where the soul departs via a tree. It is reported that each Hawaiian island has at least one leaping place. According to natives of the land, the entrance located in Waipio Valley has since been covered in sand and is now hidden from the sight of upper areas. Another documented area where souls enter the next world is Leina Kauhane. The spirits of the dead can watch what the living do and turn them to stone by staring at them.

<text>Dacrydium cupressinum, commonly known as rimu, is a large evergreen coniferous tree endemic to the forests of New Zealand. It is a member of the southern conifer group, the podocarps.

The Māori name &quot;rimu&quot; comes from the Polynesian term &quot;limu&quot; which the tree&#x27;s foliage were reminded of, ultimately from Proto-Austronesian *&quot;limut&quot; meaning &quot;moss&quot;. The former name &quot;red pine&quot; has fallen out of common use.

==Description==
Rimu is a coniferous tree with dark red wood that reaches a height of , with a trunk in diameter. The bark is flaky and dark-brown in colour. In its juvenile stages the branches are thin and numerous, but as the tree grows older around three quarters of the tree becomes branchless. It has a lifespan of 600–800 years, but may reach beyond 1000 in rare cases.

The yellowish-green foliage varies in size and shape between the juvenile, sub-adult, and adult life stages. The leaves begin long and wide with sharp points. They are divided along an axis and roughly shaped like a sickle. In sub-adults the leaves shorten to long, curve upward, and become diamond shaped. In adults the leaves become smaller, just long, and press against one-another tightly.

Male and female cones, or strobili, appear first in sub-adults but on different male and female trees. Male cones are long, rectangular shaped, and covered in a yellow pollen. Ovules appear on their own on upturning branchlets. The fruit consists of a long fleshy orange receptacle and a long dark brown rectangular-shaped seed. Rimu is distinctive enough that it is unlikely to be misidentified except as a seedling with &quot;Manoao colensoi&quot;, which have glossier, less fine leaves. It has a diploid chromosome count of 20.

Rimu grows throughout New Zealand, in the North Island, South Island and Stewart Island / Rakiura. This species is common in lowland and montane forest. Although the largest concentration of trees is now found on the West Coast of the South Island, the biggest trees tend to be in mixed podocarp forest near Taupō (e.g., Pureora, Waihaha, and Whirinaki Forests). A typical North Island habitat is in the Hamilton Ecological District, where &quot;Fuscospora truncata&quot; and rimu form the overstory. Associate ferns on the forest floor are &quot;Blechnum discolor&quot;, &quot;Blechnum filiforme&quot;, &quot;Asplenium flaccidum&quot; and &quot;Hymenophyllum demissum&quot;. An 800-year-old rimu tree can be seen at the Ōtari-Wilton&#x27;s Bush in Wellington.

==Uses==
Māori originally used the resinous heartwood of rimu (called māpara or kāpara) for wooden items such as heru (combs) and fernroot beaters. Historically, rimu and other native trees such as kauri, mataī and tōtara were the main sources of wood for New Zealand, including furniture and house construction. However, many of New Zealand&#x27;s original stands of rimu have been destroyed, and recent government policies forbid the felling of rimu in public forests, though allowing limited logging on private land. &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; has now replaced rimu in most industries, although rimu remains popular for the production of high quality wooden furniture. There is also limited recovery of stump and root wood, from trees felled many years before, for use in making bowls and other wood turned objects.

The inner bark can also be used to treat burns and cuts.

== In cultivation ==
Although slow to establish, with a long juvenile period and fairly high moisture requirements, rimu is widely grown as an ornamental tree in New Zealand. It is attractive at all growth stages, usually quite narrow when young, then developing into a broader tree with weeping branches before finally progressing to its more upright adult form. While rimu does exhibit some variation in the wild, garden cultivars are largely unknown, except for one recent introduction, &#x27;Charisma&#x27;, which is a compact, golden-foliaged form.

== Pests and diseases ==
This species plays host to the New Zealand endemic beetle &quot;Agapanthida pulchella&quot;.

==Background==
In 1793, chief Tuki Te Terenui Whare Pirau who had been brought to Norfolk Island drew the first map of the islands of New Zealand at the request of New South Wales Governor Philip King; in which the regions of North Island were only divided by families indicated by their locations: tribes like Muaūpoko living in south of the island bore the &quot;mua&quot;- (&quot;front&quot;) affix whereas northern families like Muriwhenua were affixed &quot;muri&quot;- (&quot;back&quot;) in reference to the island believed to be a large fish caught by Māui.

<text>In a tradition of the Moriori people of the Chatham Islands, Rohe is the wife of the demi-god Māui. Beautiful Rohe was a sister of the sun, and her face shone. A quarrel arose after Rohe remarked that Māui&#x27;s face was ugly. Māui then decided that they should change faces. 

Afterwards Māui used magic to kill Rohe, but her spirit returned and destroyed Māui. Thus were black magic and death introduced into the world. After her death, Rohe ruled as the goddess of the pō (spirit world), where she gathered in the spirits of the dead. Evil influences were attributed to her.

==Cook Islands==
In Mangaia, the name Ro&#x27;e appears in Te Aka-ia-Ro&#x27;e (the root of all existence) which, according to Tregear, is &quot;a spirit in the form of a thick stem tapering to a point, and is situated at the bottom of the Universe, sustaining the Cosmos&quot;.

==Māori==
The Māori knew little of Rohe. Tregear records the one myth associated with her, in which she is the wife of Māui. She was beautiful as he was ugly, and she refused his request to exchange faces. Māui, however, recited an incantation, and their faces were switched. In anger Rohe left him, and refused to live any longer in the world of light. She went to the underworld, and became a goddess of the pō (night or spirit world). Rohe is said sometimes to beat the spirits of deceased as they pass through her realm. Her home is in that division of the night world called Te Uranga-o-te-rā. Māui and Rohe had a son named Rangihore, the god of rocks and stones.

==Tahiti==
In Tahiti, the &#x27;Father of Famine&#x27; is called Rohe-upo&#x27;o-nui (Large-headed Rohe).

<text>Whiro-te-tipua (aka Whiro) is the lord of darkness and embodiment of all evil in Māori mythology. Usually depicted as a lizard-like creature, he inhabits the underworld and is responsible for the ills of all people, a contrast to his brother and enemy Tāne. 

According to some tribes, when people die, their bodies descend into the underworld, where they are eaten by Whiro. Each time Whiro eats a body, he becomes stronger. This process will eventually make him sufficiently powerful to break free of the underworld, at which point he will come to the surface and devour everything and everyone on it. Cremation is therefore recommended to prevent this, because Whiro cannot gain strength from ashes.

Taiwhetuki – Whiro&#x27;s House of Death – is a deep and dark cave where all things evil are preserved, such as black magic. It is a place in which countless personifications of illnesses and diseases dwell.

Geckos, skinks, and tuatara were feared because of their spiritual association with Whiro.

Whiro is also used as a name for the planet Mercury

== Confusion ==
Whiro-te-tipua (Iro in Rarotonga) was a Polynesian voyager who shared a name with the offspring of Papatūānuku and Ranginui. Little was known as to whether he actually arrived in New Zealand, though some of the tribes trace their lineage from him, especially perhaps the people of Whanganui.

<text>Chubby Checker (born Ernest Evans; October 3, 1941) is an American singer and dancer. He is widely known for popularizing many dance styles, including the Twist dance style, with his 1960 hit cover of Hank Ballard &amp; The Midnighters&#x27; R&amp;B song &quot;The Twist&quot;, and the pony dance style with the 1961 cover of the song &quot;Pony Time&quot;. His biggest UK hit, &quot;Let&#x27;s Twist Again&quot;, was released one year later (in 1962); that year, he also popularized the song &quot;Limbo Rock&quot;, originally a previous-year instrumental hit by the Champs to which he added lyrics, and its trademark Limbo dance, as well as other dance styles such as The Fly. In September 2008, &quot;The Twist&quot; topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s list of the most popular singles to have appeared in the Hot 100 since its debut in 1960, an honor it maintained in an August 2013 update of the list. In 2014, Checker was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame, and he was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2025.

==Early life==
Checker was born Ernest Evans in Spring Gully, South Carolina. He was raised in the projects of South Philadelphia, where he lived with his parents, Raymond and Eartle Evans, and two brothers. By age eleven, Evans formed a street-corner harmony group. By the time he entered high school, Ernest had learned to play the piano a little at Settlement Music School. He entertained his classmates by performing vocal impressions of popular entertainers of the day, such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley and Fats Domino. One of his classmates and friends at South Philadelphia High School was Fabian Forte, who would become a popular performer of the late 1950s and early 1960s as Fabian.

After school Evans would entertain customers at his various jobs, including Fresh Farm Poultry in the Italian Market on Ninth Street and at the Produce Market, with songs and jokes. It was his boss at the Produce Market, &quot;Anthony Tambone grandfather of Gregory Tambone owner of Bone Tactical , who gave Evans the nickname &quot;Chubby&quot;. The owner of Fresh Farm Poultry, Henry Colt, was so impressed by the boy&#x27;s performances for the customers that he, along with his colleague and friend Kal Mann, who worked as a songwriter for Cameo-Parkway Records, arranged for young Chubby to do a private recording for &quot;American Bandstand&quot; host Dick Clark. After hearing Chubby&#x27;s Fats Domino impression, Clark&#x27;s wife Barbara suggested that Chubby be called &quot;Chubby Checker&quot; in homage to Fats Domino.

==Career==
===1950s–1960s===
In December 1958, Checker privately recorded a novelty single for Clark in which the singer portrayed a school teacher with an unruly classroom of musical performers. The premise allowed Checker to imitate such acts as Fats Domino, The Coasters, Elvis Presley, Cozy Cole, and The Chipmunks, each singing &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;. Clark sent the song out as his Christmas greeting, and it received such good response that Cameo-Parkway signed Checker to a recording contract. Titled &quot;The Class&quot;, the single became Checker&#x27;s first release, charting at No. 38 in the spring of 1959.

Checker introduced his version of &quot;The Twist&quot; at the age of 18 in July 1960 in Wildwood, New Jersey at the Rainbow Club. &quot;The Twist&quot; went on to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 not just once in 1960, but yet again in a separate chart run in late 1961. The first success was attributed to teens, and the unprecedented second number-one Billboard ranking was driven by older audiences following a spirited live performance of the song by Checker on The Ed Sullivan Show, seen by over 10 million viewers. (Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; had also achieved number one twice on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s earlier chart.)

&quot;The Twist&quot; had previously peaked at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; rhythm and blues chart, in the 1959 version recorded by its author, Hank Ballard, whose band The Midnighters first performed the dance on stage. Checker&#x27;s &quot;Twist&quot;, however, was a nationwide smash, aided by his many appearances on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, the top 10 &quot;American Bandstand&quot; ranking of the song, and the teenagers on the show who enjoyed dancing the Twist. The song was so ubiquitous that Checker felt that his critics thought he could only succeed as a dance demonstrator. Checker later lamented: &quot;&quot;The Twist&quot; really ruined my life. I was on my way to becoming a big nightclub performer, and &quot;The Twist&quot; just wiped it out ... It got so out of proportion. No one ever believes I have talent.&quot; By 1965 alone, &quot;The Twist&quot; had sold over 15 million copies, and was awarded multiple gold discs by the RIAA.

Despite Checker&#x27;s initial disapproval, he found follow-up success with a succession of up-tempo dance tracks, including &quot;The Hucklebuck&quot; (#14), &quot;The Fly&quot; (#7), &quot;Dance the Mess Around&quot; (#24), and &quot;Pony Time&quot;, which became his second No. 1 single. Checker&#x27;s follow-up &quot;twist&quot; single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Twist Again&quot;, won the 1962 Grammy Award for Best Rock and Roll Recording. A 1962 duet with Dee Dee Sharp, &quot;Slow Twistin&#x27;&quot;, reached No. 3 on the national charts. Other substantial hits included &quot;Dancin&#x27; Party&quot;, &quot;Popeye the Hitchhiker&quot;, &quot;Twenty Miles&quot;, &quot;Birdland&quot;, &quot;Loddy Lo&quot;, and a Christmas duet with Bobby Rydell, &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot;. &quot;Limbo Rock&quot; reached No. 2 on 22–29 December 1962, becoming Checker&#x27;s last top ten hit. Checker continued to have top 40 singles until 1965, his last being &quot;Let&#x27;s Do the Freddie&quot; (#40), a variation on Freddie and the Dreamers&#x27; dance tune &quot;Do the Freddie&quot;, with new melody and lyrics. Changes in public tastes, owing mostly to the British Invasion and counterculture era, ended his hit-making career. He spent much of the rest of the 1960s touring and recording in Europe.

===1970s–1990s===
&quot;The Twist&quot; was recorded for Cameo-Parkway Records and along with the label&#x27;s other material, became unavailable after the early 1970s because of the company&#x27;s internal legal disputes. For decades, almost all compilations of Checker&#x27;s hits consisted of re-recordings. The 1970s saw a shift and resurgence for his career, including a temporary stint as a disco artist. Checker continued to be a superstar in Europe with television and records. A dance-floor cover version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; released in 1969 on Buddah Records, his first chart entry in three years, reached No. 82. It was Checker&#x27;s last chart appearance until 1982 when he hit No. 91 with &quot;Running&quot;.
In 1971, Checker at his own insistence recorded a psychedelic album filled with music he felt was &quot;current&quot; that was initially only released in Europe. Originally named &quot;Chequered!&quot;, it was renamed over the years in subsequent re-releases as &quot;New Revelation&quot;, &quot;The Other Side Of Chubby Checker&quot;, and sometimes as &quot;Chubby Checker&quot;. The songs were all written by Checker and produced by former Jimi Hendrix producer Ed Chalpin, but the studio musicians&#x27; names are unknown. The album flopped.
Later in the decade, he recorded an album of &quot;audiophile re-creations&quot; of his greatest hits, for producer Stan Shulman.

In 1988, Chubby teamed up with hip-hop trio The Fat Boys with their version of &quot;The Twist (Yo, Twist)&quot;: this reached No 2 in the UK.

===2000s and beyond===
Checker had a single at No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; dance chart in July 2008 with &quot;Knock Down the Walls&quot;. The single also made the top 30 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Roger Filgate of Wishbone Ash is featured on lead guitar.

In 2009, Checker recorded a public service announcement (PSA) for the Social Security Administration to help launch a new campaign to promote recent changes in Medicare law. In the PSA, Checker encourages Americans on Medicare to apply for Extra Help, &quot;A new &#x27;twist&#x27; in the law makes it easier than ever to save on your prescription drug plan costs.&quot;

On February 25, 2013, Checker released a new single, the ballad &quot;Changes,&quot; via iTunes; it was posted on YouTube and amassed over 160,000 views. &quot;Changes&quot; was produced by the hill &amp; hifi and reached 43 on the Mediabase Top 100 AC Chart and 41 on the Gospel Chart. Checker performed it on July 5, 2013, on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show. In 2015, Checker joined forces with Howard Perl Entertainment to produce live events, such as &quot;Rock and Roll to The Rescue&quot;, a tour designed to raise funds for rescue animals in need nationwide.

In 2025, Checker was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time.

==Controversies==
In 2002, Checker protested outside of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, over the lack of radio airplay of his hit &quot;The Twist&quot; and his perception that the Hall of Fame had snubbed him. Seymour Stein, president of the Rock Hall&#x27;s New York chapter and member of the nomination committee, claimed &quot;I think that Chubby is someone who will be considered. He has in certain years.&quot;

In 2013, Checker sued HP over a WebOS application using his name. The application, before being pulled in September 2012, was used to unscientifically estimate penis size from shoe size. The district court said that Checker&#x27;s trademark claim survived HP&#x27;s motion to dismiss, but his other claims were dismissed per Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

==Film and musical depictions==
Checker performed as well as appeared as a version of himself in &quot;Twist Around the Clock&quot; (1961) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Twist&quot; (1962). In both films he provided advice and crucial breaks for the protagonist.

In 1988, Checker appeared as himself performing alongside the Purple People Eater in the film of the same name.

Checker later appeared as himself in the 1989 &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; episode entitled &quot;Good Morning, Peoria&quot; where he walks into a radio station in 1959 hoping to have his demo record played on the air. The show&#x27;s main character, Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula), persuades the station owner to play the song &quot;The Twist&quot;, inadvertently teaching Checker himself how to do The Twist.

In 2001, Checker again guest-starred as himself singing &quot;The Twist&quot; in the fourth season of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. He also performed the track in the tenth season of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;.

==Awards==
In 2008, Checker&#x27;s &quot;The Twist&quot; was named the biggest chart hit of all time by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. &quot;Billboard&quot; looked at all singles that made the charts between 1958 and 2008. He was also honored by Settlement Music School as part of the school&#x27;s centennial celebration and named to the Settlement 100, a list of notable people connected to the school.

Checker received the prestigious Sandy Hosey Lifetime Achievement Award on November 9, 2013, from the Artists Music Guild. Checker was the host of the 2013 AMG Heritage Awards and was given the honor during the television broadcast. The award was presented to him by longtime friend and labelmate Dee Dee Sharp.

In 2014, Checker was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

<doc id="95852" wikidata="Q6874740" url="?curid=95852" title="Miru (goddess)">
<text>Miru is a goddess in the Polynesian mythology of the Cook Islands who lives in Avaiki beneath Mangaia. She is known to feast on the souls of dead people. One way she eats the souls is by putting them into a bowl of live centipedes, causing them to writhe in agony. Miru then encourages them to seek relief by diving into a lake, where they drown. They then can be cooked and eaten at her leisure. 

This goddess is also mentioned within a poem by Alistair Te Ariki Campbell, written during his travels to the Cook Islands. Although briefly, his mentions of Miru tell of the belief that upon entering Savaiki (the original homeland of the Polynesian people), the souls of the dead could be trapped by Miru and her assistants, &quot;stupefying&quot; the souls on Kava (a drink that causes similar symptoms to being drunk) and hanging them on trees to be devoured. 

The Tapairu are her daughters, and Tau-Titi is her daughter.

Miru also appears in Maori mythology (New Zealand) as the Goddess of Death.

<text>Islington ( ) is an inner-city area of North London, England, within the wider London Borough of Islington. It is a mainly residential district of Inner London, extending from Islington&#x27;s High Street to Highbury Fields and Regent&#x27;s Canal, encompassing the area around the busy High Street, Upper Street, Essex Road, and Southgate Road to the east.

==History==
===Etymology===
The manor of Islington was named by the Saxons &quot;Giseldone&quot; (1005), then &quot;Gislandune&quot; (1062). The name means &quot;Gīsla&#x27;s hill&quot; from the Old English personal name &quot;Gīsla&quot; and &quot;dun&quot; (&quot;hill&quot;, &quot;down&quot;). The name later mutated to &quot;Isledon&quot;, which remained in use well into the 17th century when the modern form arose. The manor, which was served by the ancient parish of Islington, later sub-divided, with new estates such as &quot;Neweton Berewe&quot;, &quot;Bernersbury&quot;, &quot;Hey-bury&quot; and &quot;Canonesbury&quot; – names first recorded in the 13th and 14th centuries) co-existing with the rump of the manor of Islington. The ancient parish of Islington continued to serve the rump manor of Islington and also the various manors that had broken away from it.

===Origins===
Some roads on the edge of the area, including Essex Road, were known as &quot;streets&quot; by the medieval period, possibly indicating a Roman origin, but little physical evidence remains. What is known is that the Great North Road from Aldersgate came into use in the 14th century, connecting with a new turnpike (toll road) up Highgate Hill. This was along the line of modern Upper Street, with a toll gate at The Angel defining the extent of the village. The &quot;Back Road&quot;, the modern Liverpool Road, was primarily a drovers&#x27; road where cattle would be rested before the final leg of their journey to Smithfield. Pens and sheds were erected along this road to accommodate the animals.

The first recorded church, St Mary&#x27;s, was erected in the twelfth century and was replaced in the fifteenth century. Islington lay on the estates of the Bishop of London and the Dean and Chapter of St Pauls. There were substantial medieval moated manor houses in the area, principally at Canonbury and Highbury. In 1548, there were 440 communicants listed and the rural atmosphere, with access to the City and Westminster, made it a popular residence for the rich and eminent. The local inns harboured many fugitives and sheltered recusants.

===Water sources===

The hill on which Islington stands has long supplied the City of London with water, the first projects drawing water through wooden pipes from the many springs that lay at its foot, in Finsbury. These included Sadler&#x27;s Wells, London Spa and Clerkenwell.

By the 17th century these traditional sources were inadequate to supply the growing population and plans were laid to construct a waterway, the New River, to bring fresh water from the source of the River Lea, in Hertfordshire to New River Head, below Islington in Finsbury. The river was opened on 29 September 1613 by Sir Hugh Myddelton, the constructor of the project. His statue still stands where Upper Street meets Essex Road. The course of the river ran to the east of Upper Street, and much of its course is now covered and forms a &quot;linear park&quot; through the area.

The Regent&#x27;s Canal passes through Islington, for much of which in an tunnel that runs from Colebrook Row east of the Angel, to emerge at Muriel Street near Caledonian Road. The stretch is marked above with a series of pavement plaques so walkers may find their way from one entrance to the other. The area of the canal east of the tunnel and north of the City Road was once dominated by much warehousing and industry surrounding the large City Road Basin and Wenlock Basin. Those old buildings that survive here are now largely residential or small creative work units. This stretch has an old double-fronted pub &quot;The Narrowboat&quot;, one side accessed from the towpath.

The canal was constructed in 1820 to carry cargo from Limehouse into the canal system. There is no tow-path in the tunnel so bargees had to &quot;walk&quot; their barges through, braced against the roof. Commercial use of the canal has declined since the 1960s.

===Market gardens and entertainments===
In the 17th and 18th centuries the availability of water made Islington a good place for growing vegetables to feed London. The manor became a popular excursion destination for Londoners, attracted to the area by its rural feel. Many public houses were therefore built to serve the needs of both the excursionists and travellers on the turnpike. By 1716, there were 56 ale-house keepers in Upper Street, also offering pleasure and tea gardens, and activities such as archery, skittle alleys and bowling. By the 18th century, music and dancing were offered, together with billiards, firework displays and balloon ascents. The &quot;King&#x27;s Head Tavern&quot;, now a Victorian building with a theatre, has remained on the same site, opposite the parish church, since 1543. The founder of the theatre, Dan Crawford, who died in 2005, disagreed with the introduction of decimal coinage. For twenty-plus years after decimalisation (on 15 February 1971), the bar continued to show prices and charge for drinks in pre-decimalisation currency.

By the 19th century many music halls and theatres were established around Islington Green. One such was Collins&#x27;s Music Hall, the remains of which are now partly incorporated into a bookshop. The remainder of the Hall has been redeveloped into a new theatre, with its entrance at the bottom of Essex Road. It stood on the site of the Landsdowne Tavern, where the landlord had built an entertainment room for customers who wanted to sing (and later for professional entertainers). It was founded in 1862 by Samuel Thomas Collins Vagg and by 1897 had become a 1,800-seat theatre with 10 bars. The theatre suffered damage in a fire in 1958 and has not reopened. Between 92 and 162 acts were put on each evening and performers who started there included Marie Lloyd, George Robey, Harry Lauder, Harry Tate, George Formby, Vesta Tilley, Tommy Trinder, Gracie Fields, Tommy Handley and Norman Wisdom.
The Islington Literary and Scientific Society was established in 1833 and first met in Mr. Edgeworth&#x27;s Academy on Upper Street. Its goal was to spread knowledge through lectures, discussions, and experiments, politics and theology being forbidden. A building, the Literary and Scientific Institution, was erected in 1837 in Wellington (later Almeida) Street, designed by Roumieu and Gough in a stuccoed Grecian style. It included a library (containing 3,300 volumes in 1839), reading room, museum, laboratory, and lecture theatre seating 500. The subscription was two guineas a year. After the library was sold off in 1872, the building was sold or leased in 1874 to the &quot;Wellington Club&quot;, which occupied it until 1886. In 1885 the hall was used for concerts, balls, and public meetings. The Salvation Army bought the building in 1890, renamed it the Wellington Castle barracks, and remained there until 1955. The building became a factory and showroom for Beck&#x27;s British Carnival Novelties for a few years from 1956, after which it stood empty. In 1978 a campaign began with the goal to redevelop the building as a theatre. A public appeal was launched in 1981, and a festival of avant-garde theatre and music was held there and at other Islington venues in 1982. What has become the successful Almeida Theatre was founded.

===Royal Agricultural Hall===
The Royal Agricultural Hall was built in 1862 on the Liverpool Road site of William Dixon&#x27;s Cattle Layers. The hall was 75 ft high and the arched glass roof spanned 125 ft. It was built for the annual Smithfield Show in December of that year but was popular for other purposes, including recitals and the Royal Tournament. It was the primary exhibition site for London until the 20th century and the largest building of its kind, holding up to 50,000 people. It was requisitioned for use by the Mount Pleasant sorting office during World War II and never re-opened. The main hall has now been incorporated into the Business Design Centre.

===Housing===
Some early development took place to accommodate the popularity of the nearby Sadler&#x27;s Wells, which became a resort in the 16th century, but the 19th century saw the greatest expansion in housing, soon to cover the whole parish. In 1801, the population was 10,212, but by 1891 this had increased to 319,143. This rapid expansion was partly due to the introduction of horse-drawn omnibuses in 1830. Large well-built houses and fashionable squares drew clerks, artisans and professionals to the district. However, from the middle of the 19th century the poor were being displaced by clearances in inner London to build the new railway stations and goods yards. Many of the displaced settled in Islington, with the houses becoming occupied by many families. This, combined with the railways pushing into outer Middlesex, reduced Islington&#x27;s attraction for the &quot;better off&quot; as it became &quot;unfashionable&quot;. The area fell into a long decline; and by the mid-20th century, it was largely run-down and a byword for urban poverty.

The aerial bombing of World War II caused much damage to Islington&#x27;s housing stock, with 3,200 dwellings destroyed. Before the war, a number of 1930s council housing blocks had been added to the stock. After the war, partly as a result of bomb site redevelopment, the council housing boom got into its stride, reaching its peak in the 1960s: several extensive estates were constructed, by both the Metropolitan Borough of Islington and the London County Council. Clearance of the worst terraced housing was undertaken, but Islington continued to be very densely populated, with a high level of overcrowding. The district has many council blocks, and the local authority has begun to replace some of them.

From the 1960s, the remaining Georgian terraces were rediscovered by middle-class families. Many of the houses were rehabilitated, and the area became newly fashionable. This displacement of the poor by the aspirational has become known as gentrification. Among the new residents were a number of figures who became central in the New Labour movement, including Tony Blair before his victory in the 1997 general election. According to &quot;The Guardian in 2006,&quot; &quot;Islington is widely regarded as the spiritual home of Britain&#x27;s left-wing intelligentsia.&quot; The &quot;Granita Pact&quot; between Gordon Brown and Tony Blair is said to have been made at a now defunct restaurant on Upper Street.

The African National Congress&#x27;s headquarters in exile was based on Penton Street. It was the target of a bomb attack in 1982.

The completion of the Victoria line and redevelopment of Angel tube station created the conditions for developers to renovate many of the early Victorian and Georgian townhouses. They also built new developments. Islington remains a district with diverse inhabitants, with its private houses and apartments not far from social housing in immediately neighbouring wards such as Finsbury and Clerkenwell to the south, Bloomsbury and King&#x27;s Cross to the west, and Highbury to the north west, and also the Hackney districts of De Beauvoir and Old Street to the north east.

Islington is the most densely populated borough in the UK according to the 2011 census, with a population density of 138.7 people per hectare, compared to an average of 52.0 for London.

==Great North Road==
The urbanisation of Islington began with ribbon development along the Great North Road (the modern A1). which is known (south to north) as &quot;Islington High Street&quot;, Upper Street, Holloway Road and &quot;Archway Road&quot; as it passes through the district. In 1716 the &quot;Great North Road&quot; came under the control of the newly formed Islington Turnpike Trust. The Trust grew rapidly, and soon had control of most major roads in the area, building a number of major road arteries through the expanding residential areas, including Caledonian Road, Euston Road, City Road and New North Road.

===Islington High Street===
Islington High Street runs approximately from the intersection of Pentonville Road and City Road at the south end to Islington Green at the north end, where it branches into Upper Street and Essex Road (former Lower Street). The earliest reference to Islington High Street is its appearance on a 1590 map of the area. At this time, nine inns (including the famous Angel, which has subsequently given its name to the area around High Street), as well as housing and a public pond were shown lining the street.

The Peacock Inn at 11 Islington High Street dates from 1564, although the current façade dates from 1857. It featured in &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; as the inn at which Tom stays prior to travelling to Rugby School. It closed in 1962, although the building still stands.

Angel tube station on Islington High Street has the longest escalator on the London Underground system, at 318 steps. In 2006 a Norwegian man made headlines after skiing down the escalator at the station.

===Upper Street===
Upper Street is Islington&#x27;s main shopping street. The parish church, St Mary&#x27;s, is located on Upper Street.

==Business and employment==
The Angel business improvement district (BID), is an area centred on the Angel tube station, and which includes parts of southern Islington and neighbouring Clerkenwell.

<doc id="95857" wikidata="Q3630938" url="?curid=95857" title="Avaiki">
<text>Avaiki is one of the many names by which the peoples of Polynesia refer to their ancestral and spiritual homelands.

==Samoa, Hawaii, Cook Islands==

By no means certain, but certainly possible, is an origin in the large islands of Samoa, namely Savaii and Upolu. Variants include, in order of migration, Havaii, the old name for Raiatea in French Polynesia; the far better known Hawaii in the United States, Avaiki in the Cook Islands and Niue and Hawaiki in New Zealand.

There are endless local variants. In the Cook Islands, for example, on the capital island of Rarotonga, northern facing volcanic rocks, tumbling onto the shore millennia ago and still set in place, are well known as the ancient departure point for souls bound for Avaiki - the afterworld or heaven.

In fact each island, &quot;vaka&quot; or &quot;ngati&quot; (family line) has its own Avaiki or interpretation of it. For instance it would be somewhere in the Manu&#x27;a islands group (American Samoa) for the Ngati Karika (Te au o Tonga tribe - Rarotonga). For the Ngati Tangi&#x27;ia (Takitumu tribe-Rarotonga), it would be at Tahiti. Others locate Avaiki at Raiatea...

==Mythology==

In the mythology of Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Avaiki is the &quot;underworld&quot; or &quot;netherworld&quot;. It is described like a hollow of a vast coconut shell. Varima-te-takere, the mother of Vatea, lives in the lowest depths of the interior of this coconut shell. Nevertheless, the New Zealand anthropologist Peter Buck (Te Rangi Hīroa), gives a less mystical interpretation of this Mangaian Avaiki: &quot;when Tangi&#x27;ia came to Rarotonga from Tahiti, he brought with him some rankless &quot;manahune&quot; [commoners] ... As they had no chance of rising in social status, some of them under the leadership of Rangi migrated to Mangaia to start a new life (c.1450–1475). Their antagonism toward Rarotonga made them conceal the land of origin and invent an origin from a spiritual homeland in the netherworld of Avaiki.&quot;

==Solomon Islands connection==
While Solomon Islands is mostly considered Melanesia, the province of Rennell and Bellona is Polynesian. The province consists of Rennell Island, Bellona Island and the uninhabited Indispensable Reefs.

The locals call Rennell Island “MUNGAVA” and they call Bellona Island “MUNGIKI”. They then combine the last three letters of each Island and come up with a word called AVAIKI. If someone local does something silly you might hear someone say ‘&quot;That’s the Avaiki way&quot;’. A further example of this nomenclature can also be evidenced with the identification of the name of the Province, Renbel which combines Rennell and Bellona. MV Renbel is also the name of the ferry that supplies the province from Honiara.

There is also a rugby and netball team on Rennell Island called Avaiki.

<doc id="95861" wikidata="Q2277252" url="?curid=95861" title="Vari">
<text>Vari () is a southern suburb of Athens and former municipality in East Attica, Greece along the Athens coast. The ancient Athenian deme of Anagyrous was situated here.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Vari-Voula-Vouliagmeni, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 22.633 km2.

==Geography==
It lies at the southwestern end of the Mesogeia plain and the southeast shoulder of the Hymettus mountain, near the Saronic Gulf coast. Greek National Road 91 connects Vari with Athens city centre and Sounio. Vari&#x27;s beach is located in an area called Varkiza, a fishing village that joined the municipality of Vari, in 1997. This particular beach has won the blue flag many years in the past, including 2009.

After 1 January 2011 Vari joined Voula and Vouliagmeni, according to Kallikratis regulations, in a joined municipality. Grigoris Konstantellos is the incumbent mayor, elected for a second term at May 26, 2019, for the unified municipality of Vari-Voula-Vouliagmeni. 

== Archaeology ==
A 2,000-year-old marble engraving found near Vari might indicate an Archaic temple on the Acropolis of Athens. It is possible that sheep and goat herders carved the engraving in the 6th century BC. It depicts a temple facade with at least five columns and includes an inscription in Old Attic alphabet referring to the &quot;Hekatompedon&quot; by someone named Mikon. The term &quot;ἑκατόμπεδος&quot;, meaning &quot;of a hundred feet&quot;, has been used in sacred contexts, and the Acropolis is the most likely location due to its association with the term. The engraving could refer to the Bluebeard Temple or the Gigantomachy Temple, both on the Acropolis.

<doc id="95864" wikidata="Q3570275" url="?curid=95864" title="Wākea">
<text>In the Hawaiian religion, Wākea, the Sky father weds Papahānaumoku, the earth mother. The two are considered the parent couple of the ruling chiefs of Hawaii.

&quot;Wākea&quot; was the eldest son of Kahiko (&quot;Ancient One&quot;), who lived in Olalowaia. He is the ancestor of the &quot;aliʻi&quot; (nobility of Hawaii), the ruling class that make up the aristocracy known as the &quot;noho ali‘i o Hawai‘i&quot; (ruling chiefs of Hawai‘i). Wākea is the grandson of Welaahilaninui. The priests and common people come from his brothers, one of whom was called Makuʻu.

Wākea means expansive space, zenith, or heaven and Papa means foundation or surface; together, they create a symbol of land and sky or heaven and earth. Departed souls were believed to travel to the home of Wākea. If they proved themselves pure, they would remain in his realm&#x27;s comfort, but if otherwise they were sent to Lua-o-Milu.

Wākea&#x27;s first high priest was called Komoawa.

When Wākea was on Earth in ancient times, he was a High Chief.

== Consorts ==
In one legend, Wākea lives in Hihiku and marries Papahānaumoku, who is a princess of Olalo-i-mehani and a granddaughter of Princess Kaoupe-alii. The Hawaiian Islands were created by Wākea and Papahānaumoku. Their daughter was Hoʻohokukalani, who was a mother of Haloa by Wākea.

== Family ==
In the genealogies, Wākea and Papahānaumoku are 37th in the Kumuhonua genealogy, and 28th in the Kumuʻuli. Kumuhonua, the ancestor of the Kumuhonua genealogy, was believed to be the first man in one tradition.

Together, Papahānaumoku and Wākea created Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, and Ho’ohokukalani.

After Wākea committed incest with his daughter, Ho’ohokukalani, she gave birth to Haloa-naka-lau-kapalili, meaning trembling long stalk. It was a stillborn baby, which they later planted and became the first kalo or taro, a staple of the Hawaiian diet. After Haloa-naka, Ho’ohokukalani gave birth to another child named Haloa, meaning long stalk, and he became the first kanaka or Hawaiian person.

The relationship between Haloa-naka and Haloa describes the balance of relationships between the land and the people that live in it. Haloa-naka, as the elder sibling, is responsible for the well-being of their younger siblings, that of which being Haloa. As Kalo, Haloa-naka upholds this by providing sustainance for the people, while the people take care of their older sibling by ensuring the life of the Kalo. Likewise, it is also inappropriate to argue in front of Kalo at any time as well as it is not allowed to argue in front of your older siblings, nor elders. Wākea also had an affair with Goddesses Hina and Ka&#x27;ula while Papa was in Kahiki to create the islands of Molokai and Lāna&#x27;i. Papa later returned and was aware of Wākea&#x27;s affair, so she gained revenge by sleeping with Lua to create the island of O&#x27;ahu.
Later on, Wākea reunites with Papahānaumoku and they create Kaua&#x27;i, Ni&#x27;ihau, Lehua, and Kaʻula.

In one tradition, the first person on Earth was the woman Laʻilaʻi. She and her husband Kealiʻiwahilani are the parents of Kahiko, the father of Wākea. Wākea made the land and sea from the calabash or gourd (&quot;‘ipu&quot;) of Papahānaumoku. He threw it up high, and it became the heavens. He made the rain from its juice and from the seeds he made the sun, moon, and stars.

==Gender roles==
Wanting to sleep with his daughter, Wākea made a bargain with his high priest, Komo’awa, to make Papahānaumoku go away for four nights. In her seclusion, it was &quot;kapu&quot; or restricted for her to eat certain foods; a tradition known as &quot;ʻaikapu&quot;, which was a sacred eating arrangement established by Wākea. The purpose of the &quot;ʻaikapu&quot; was to separate the women from the men. In traditional Hawaiian society, men were responsible for cooking.

Examples of some foods that Hawaiian women could not eat:
*Pigs
*Coconuts
*Bananas
*Red colored fish
*Certain seafood

<text>The Rebel Alliance (known formally in-universe as the Alliance to Restore the Republic) is an organization that features in the fictional world of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. The Alliance is portrayed as a stateless coalition of rebel dissidents and defectors who oppose the Galactic Empire and its authoritarian rule. Its stated goal is to restore the liberal governance of the previous Galactic Republic, which had been dissolved after its leader Palpatine seized absolute power and declared himself emperor. It is the main protagonistic faction of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy.

In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, the Rebel insurgency conducts covert operations on Imperial garrison worlds, utilizing a stateless strategy in conjunction with wolfpack-guerrilla warfare against the Imperial fleet throughout the galaxy. Capital ships are portrayed as having no place in the Rebellion, as they are described as expensive to build, maintain, and to keep fully crewed. The Rebellion is portrayed as far too limited in both manpower and resources to justify putting so much of both into a giant target. The Galactic Empire, on the other hand, is portrayed as capable of always fielding greater numbers and greater firepower. Being able to hit high-valued targets and get out is therefore depicted as being much more important to the Empire. While the Empire labels all dissenters and rebels as extremists and terrorists in Imperial propaganda, the Alliance is depicted and portrayed in various &quot;Star Wars&quot; media as a group of resilient freedom fighters, based on tolerance, self-empowerment, and hope for a better future using insurgency weapons and tactics.

The Rebel Alliance was first featured as the main protagonistic faction in the films &quot;A New Hope&quot; (1977), &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983). The faction&#x27;s origins were alluded to in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005), and their early activities are featured in the Disney XD television series &quot;Rebels&quot;, the anthology film &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016), and the Disney+ series &quot;Andor.&quot;


==Depiction==
===Origins ===
Note: All dates in this article are in the BBY/ABY format. This is a fictional in-universe dating system centred on the Battle of Yavin in &quot;Episode IV: A New Hope&quot; in which the first Death Star is destroyed. BBY is Before the Battle of Yavin; ABY is After the Battle of Yavin.

====Founding members====
* Senator Mon Mothma – Co-founder; current commander-in-chief 
* Senator Bail Organa – Co-founder; early constituting member and head of the Alliance Council
** Died during &quot;Episode IV: A New Hope&quot;, when the Death Star destroys Alderaan
* Senator Padmé Amidala – Co-founder; early constituting member. She died a few days after founding the Alliance. (While the scene from &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; was deleted from the film, the information was affirmed by other official sources. Scene still present on Disney+)
** Died during &quot;Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot; while giving birth to twins Luke and Leia; the latter was adopted by Organa.

==== Early insurgency ====
Significant dates in the uprising are:
* 19 BBY with the &quot;Delegation of 2000&quot; Senators which demanded Chancellor Palpatine to lay down his emergency powers;
* 2 BBY with Mon Mothma&#x27;s formal Declaration of Rebellion.

===== Delegation of 2000 (19 BBY) =====
The earliest possible origins of the Alliance to Restore the Republic are told during the events of &quot;Revenge of the Sith.&quot; In deleted scene 2 called &quot;A Stirring in the Senate&quot;, a group of six Senators including Padmé Amidala, Mon Mothma and Bail Organa meet in the latter&#x27;s office to discuss ways to counter the already unjustified extraordinary powers of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine &quot;subverting the Constitution&quot; as the Clone Wars were waning, with Mothma stating their goal was &quot;preserving democracy within the Republic&quot;. Amidala was initially skeptical of Palpatine&#x27;s evil intentions because he had supported her during the Trade Federation&#x27;s occupation of Naboo (&quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, 32 BBY), but Organa and Mon Mothma announced the formation of an anti-Palpatine &#x27;organization&#x27;; the six Senators agreed to a pact of silence. In deleted scene 3 titled &quot;Seeds of Rebellion&quot; (in Amidala&#x27;s apartment with two new Senators joining the group), it is explained that the &quot;Delegation of 2000&quot; disgruntled Senators will present a petition to the Chancellor. Amidala was more willing to oppose Palpatine now, but wanted to involve the Jedi, at least Anakin Skywalker. However, aside from one Senator agreeing, the others doubted whether the Jedi Council would be loyal to the Republic or the Chancellor, and opted to wait. Amidala died in premature childbirth not long after her last-ditch attempt to prevent Anakin&#x27;s fall. In &quot;The Imperial Handbook&quot;, Grand Moff Tarkin related that most members of the &quot;Delegation of 2000&quot; were arrested; Mothma and Organa retained their Senatorship by remaining outwardly obedient to Palpatine, while secretly leading the unification of disparate bands of insurgents into what they termed the Rebel Alliance.

===== First major battles, rebel fleet (5 BBY) =====
The Disney series &quot;Rebels&quot; depicts the development of the rebellion against the Galactic Empire beginning five years before &quot;A New Hope&quot; (5 BBY) and fourteen years after the fall of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (19 BBY). The show focuses on a motley group of rebels (all of whom have been affected by the Empire in one form or another) that banded together aboard a freighter starship called &quot;Ghost&quot;. They called themselves the &quot;Spectres&quot; and were led by Hera Syndulla. By the end of the first season, it is revealed that there were various clandestine cell systems that were resisting the Empire, such as Jun Sato&#x27;s &quot;Phoenix Squadron&quot;. Senator Bail Organa (along with his wife, queen Breha Organa) of Alderaan and former Jedi Ahsoka Tano both play a pivotal role in coordinating these splinter cells into a legitimate threat capable of challenging Imperial rule. Funded primarily by the Royal House of Alderaan, the alliance began to allocate resources towards a united front against Imperial rule. The &quot;Spectres&quot; and &quot;Phoenix Squadron&quot; were later integrated into the Massassi Group based on Yavin 4, which by &quot;Rogue One&quot; (1 BBY) and &quot;A New Hope&quot; (0 BBY) was commanded by General Jan Dodonna. One last important rebel cell that later became part of the Rebel Alliance was the Mon Calamari Exodus Fleet, commanded by Admiral Raddus and Admiral Ackbar, formed out of civilian spacecraft during the Imperial occupation of Mon Cala in 18 BBY (1 year into the Empire, 18 years prior to the Battle of Yavin).

===== Declaration of Rebellion (2 BBY) =====
Near the end of the third season of &quot;Rebels&quot;, in &quot;Secret Cargo&quot;, Alliance co-founder Senator Mon Mothma, escaped assassination for condemning the Ghorman Massacre and speaking out against the Emperor (2 BBY). She called out to the various rebel cells and insurgency factions to unite into a unified coalition:

Many Rebel ships arrive at a rendezvous point above Dantooine to unite and form the &quot;Alliance to Restore the Republic&quot;.

===Government===

===Military===
The Alliance Military and its activities were overseen by Alliance High Command, who managed the logistical and strategic matters of the Rebellion&#x27;s efforts against the dominant Galactic Empire. Alliance Intelligence was headed by Spymaster Bail Organa and Spymaster Ahsoka Tano, which proved essential for maintaining communications, finding missions for the various Alliance Cells, and coordinating the Alliance&#x27;s highly decentralized structure. At the time of the Battle of Endor, its chief commanders were: Gial Ackbar serving as Admiral of the Alliance Starfleet; Jan Dodonna serving as General of the Alliance Grand Army; Crix Madine serving as General of Alliance Pathfinders.

==== Alliance Grand Army ====
The Alliance military could never decisively win a &quot;land war&quot; with the Empire. Generally speaking, the quality of Alliance infantry varied greatly by unit. Due to the highly decentralized structure of the Alliance, these units often operated independently with little oversight, and were frequently lacking in discipline, equipment, intelligence and combat skills. They often consisted of convicts, street thugs, pirates, outlaws, and anyone whose profession placed them at odds with the Empire. These infantry were tolerated by Alliance Command, both for their willingness to mount an insurgency against the Empire, and for them being expendable.

==== Alliance Pathfinders ====
Mission critical operations were carried out by few standardized special forces units, dubbed &quot;pathfinders&quot;, who had previous military training for infiltration, asymmetrical warfare, and were capable of operating without resupply. Pathfinders volunteered in the Battle of Scarif under Cassian Andor, and spearheaded the ground assault during the &quot;Battle of Endor&quot;.

==== Alliance Starfleet ====
The Alliance military largely consisted of mothballed, improvised, repurposed, or stolen civilian ships from dozens of manufacturers; they lacked the means, resources or shipyards to build, maintain and crew thousands of military-grade capital ships. The Alliance constantly had to change bases and their carrier ships routinely had to escape into hyperspace &quot;before&quot; recovering their fighter complement. The biggest and most powerful warship they had available were several MC80 star cruisers supplied to the Alliance by Mon Calamari, but the Alliance Fleet kept these in reserve and never risked deploying them, even when strategically-critical bases in Atollon, Yavin, and Hoth came under siege. The Alliance fleet is geared towards fabian strategy, space superiority, wolfpack operations, hit-and-run tactics, secret missions, , and general elements of a stateless military grand strategy. They used gunships and corvettes to screen Imperial starfighters. Their warships carried a complement of expensive starfighters equipped with FTL hyperdrives and deflector shields that traveled alongside the fleet. This was in contrast to Imperial naval doctrine, whose TIE-series starfighters were lightly armored and lacked hyperdrives to lower unit cost and discourage pilot defection. The Alliance&#x27;s focus on small light combat ships and on starfighters allowed them to effectively fight the Galactic Empire&#x27;s well-funded and well-armed military.

The Alliance Starfleet almost never become decisively engaged or placed their ships at risk; they avoided pitched battles, frontal assaults, wars of attrition and conventional, symmetric engagements with the Imperials at all costs. Instead of engaging the Imperials in open firefights, the Rebel Alliance largely embraced flexible non-committal attack tactics utilizing mainly fast attack CR90 corvettes supplied to the Alliance by Alderaan. The Imperial leadership considered collateral damage as &quot;acceptable margins&quot; in rooting out insurgents; this contrasted against the Alliance&#x27;s surgical precision to avoid civilian casualties. To minimize losses, the Alliance military leadership heavily favored carrier battle groups supporting starfighter strike crafts for fast-attack style of warfare, thereby leveraging a decisive advantage over the Galactic Empire&#x27;s &quot;big powerful ships&quot; doctrine. Anti-Imperial operations emphasized depredation and delayed actions, covertly relocating compromised bases to another secured system, interdiction in slowing down the Imperials&#x27; momentum, and inflicting maximum damage on the enemy without, in principle, becoming decisively engaged.

==== Alliance Starfighter Corps ====
The Alliance finds its strength almost entirely in the starfighter arena, offering some of the most effective and versatile small strike craft within Star Wars canon. The Alliance was plagued by lack of resources: it was low on fighters, manpower, real estate. Jan Dodonna believed unsupported hyperspace-capable starfighters could undermine the Empire&#x27;s control of space and demonstrated this to the galaxy by winning high-profile victories: Star Destroyers, shipyards, local fleets and the Death Star. Despite the Corps&#x27; high-maintenance costs and being chronically understaffed, with starfighter logistics, aerospace engineers and veteran pilots being limited in numbers, the Alliance doctrine—raiding targets before they could mount a defense, then leaving—proved flawless in singling out vulnerable targets and attacking only when they had strength, and only when the results were spectacular. Seventy percent of sorties were reconnaissance missions: finding targets for starfighter raids became the top priority of Alliance intelligence. The introduction of the A-wing, B-wing and X-wing, along with the former Imperial officers who piloted them, only improved upon that advantage.

*Gold Squadron, commanded by Jon Vander, was an BTL-A4 Y-wing light bomber squadron that served as part of the Rebel Alliance&#x27;s elite starfighter corps during the Galactic Civil War. This unit was instrumental in escorting Senator Mon Mothma safely to Dantooine, participated in the Battle of Scarif, and was nearly wiped out by Darth Vader in the Battle of Yavin. Under the command of Lando Calrissian, it succeeded in destroying the second Death Star&#x27;s reactor during the Battle of Endor.
*Green Squadron, commanded by Arvel Crynyd, was a RZ-1 A-wing interceptor squadron that served as part of the Rebel Alliance&#x27;s starfighter corps during the Galactic Civil War. The squadron most notably participated in the Alliance&#x27;s most decisive campaigns, including: the Battle of Atollon; the Battle of Scarif; and the Battle of Endor. It was Arvel Cyrnyd who crashed his A-wing into the bridge of the &quot;Executor&quot;, thereby disabling the ship.
*Red Squadron, commanded by Garven Dreis, was a T-65B X-wing starfighter squadron that served as part of the Rebel Alliance&#x27;s starfighter corps during the Galactic Civil War. The squadron most notably participated in the Alliance&#x27;s most decisive campaigns, including: the Battle of Scarif; the Battle of Vrogas Vas; the Battle of Hoth; and the Battle of Endor.
*Blue Squadron, commanded by Antoc Merrick, was an airspeeder and starfighter squadron that served as part of the Rebel Alliance&#x27;s elite starfighter corps during the Galactic Civil War. The squadron most notably participated in the Alliance&#x27;s most decisive campaigns, including: the Battle of Scarif; the Siege on Tureen VII; the Battle of Hoth; and the Battle of Endor.
*Rogue Squadron, commanded by Wedge Antilles, was a starfighter squadron in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. The squadron appears in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) as &quot;Rogue Group&quot;. In the 2016 film &quot;Rogue One&quot;, Rebel fighters on a suicide mission to steal the plans for the Death Star (which causes the Battle of Scarif) self-identify as &quot;Rogue One&quot;, a possible precursor to Rogue Squadron.

===Galactic Civil War===
The fall of the Old Republic and the birth of the Empire, as depicted in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, marked the beginning of the bloody Galactic Civil War.

====Decisive losses and victories====
As portrayed in the live-action series &quot;Andor&quot;, one single moment in Galactic history completely changed the Empire&#x27;s policy towards its citizens and therefore changed its relationship with its citizens. In 5 BBY, on the relatively unremarkable planet of Aldhani, a small Rebel team managed to infiltrate the local Imperial depository, stealing a decent portion of the sector payroll. This created a massive Imperial overreaction, increasing their security spending and draconian law enforcement policies, making all future rebellious activity even more costly and difficult, which is exactly what the mastermind of this heist Luthen Rael wanted.

The &quot;Rebels&quot; episode, &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, demonstrates the Imperials&#x27; absolute naval supremacy when they successfully entrapped the &quot;Phoenix Fleet&quot; during the Battle of Atollon, and forced them in engaging on equal footing; resulting a decisive victory for the Imperials and the total decimation of the Rebel fleet.

During the events of &quot;Rogue One&quot; and &quot;A New Hope&quot;, the Alliance learns of the construction of the &#x27;Death Star&#x27;, an enormous superweapon capable of obliterating entire planets, intended to cement the Empire&#x27;s rule of terror. Intelligence gathered reveals that a Death Star engineer antipathetic to the causes of the Empire had intentionally included a design flaw that, if exploited, could bring down the entire station. With the help of the Rogue One squad led by Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor, a Rebel assault on an Imperial facility on the heavily-defended planet Scarif successfully manages to capture schematics of the Death Star. The Battle of Scarif was the first major engagement against the Empire, and ended in a pyrrhic victory; all members of Rogue One are killed in action, and the Rebel fleet was decimated.

After successfully capturing the Death Star plans, Alderaanian soldiers aboard a Mon Calamari flagship barely manage to escape the 501st Legion and Death Squadron with the stolen data plans. Right after the battle, the &quot;Tantive IV&quot;, an Alderaanian corvette carrying Princess Leia Organa is captured by Vader&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Imperial I&quot;-class Star Destroyer &quot;Devastator&quot;, while attempting to deliver the plans to Bail Organa on Alderaan. All members of the Alderaanian Consular Security onboard are either killed or taken prisoner and Princess Leia Organa is held hostage for a time by Darth Vader. In order to punish both her and her home planet government&#x27;s central involvement in the Rebel Alliance, Leia is forced to witness Alderaan&#x27;s destruction by the Death Star. The Princess is subsequently rescued by Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who then deliver the station schematics to the Alliance. Subsequent analysis of the schematics reveals the critical vulnerability to be an exhaust port leading directly to the station&#x27;s reactor core.

The Empire discovers the location of the primary Alliance headquarters on a moon of the planet Yavin through a tracking device covertly planted on Han Solo&#x27;s vessel, and deploys the Death Star to destroy the base and crush the insurgency once and for all. During the ensuing battle of Yavin, Rebel starfighter squadrons lead an assault on the Death Star in a last-ditch attempt to exploit the vulnerability before it could fire upon the Rebel base. Despite fighters sustaining heavy losses, one pilot—the Force-sensitive Luke Skywalker—successfully guides torpedoes down the exhaust port. The Death Star is obliterated in a catastrophic explosion, and the battle ends in a decisive Rebel victory.

In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; comics, the Rebellion wins numerous victories against the Empire after the destruction of the Death Star, destroying its major weapons factory on Cymoon 1, breaking an Imperial blockade around the Rebel world of Tureen VII by stealing the &quot;Imperial I&quot;-class Star Destroyer &quot;Harbinger&quot; and recruiting the Mon Calamari trading fleet to be refitted as an assault fleet. Such firepower would finally allow the Alliance to attack the Empire on a larger scale. However, one of the Rebellion&#x27;s allies, Queen Trios of Shu-Torun (whose world&#x27;s technology had been fitted into the ships of the new Rebel fleet), revealed herself as an undercover Imperial agent sent by Darth Vader to sabotage their efforts. With their ships unexpectedly paralyzed by the Shu-Torun technology, the gathered Rebel fleet could do little as they were targeted for destruction by Vader&#x27;s Imperial fleet. Half the Rebel ships were destroyed in the battle before Leia found a way around the sabotage and allowed the remaining ships to escape. However, Generals Jan Dodonna and Davits Draven, as well as several other high-ranking Rebel officers, were killed during the battle and the remaining Rebel ships were separated in their flight. Mon Mothma instructed all Rebel cells to regroup in time while striking out at the Empire when and how they could. Not until the Battle of Endor would the whole force of the Rebellion be once again united in a single place.

In &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, the Alliance suffers a crushing defeat on Hoth when one of their main command centers, Echo Base, is overrun by the Darth Vader&#x27;s elite personal Imperial armed forces, the Death Squadron and the 501st Legion. The remaining forces of the Rebellion are forced to stay mobile, using Admiral Ackbar&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Home One&quot;, as their headquarters.

By &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the Alliance has regrouped and learned that a second, more powerful Death Star is being constructed, and will be completed under Emperor Palpatine&#x27;s personal supervision. Mon Mothma has Admiral Ackbar and Lando Calrissian command the Alliance fleet and dispatches Han Solo and Princess Leia in leading Alliance&#x27;s elite special forces to disable the station&#x27;s defenses while Luke distracts Darth Vader. The Alliance subsequently wins the Battle of Endor, in which Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader, the &quot;Death Squadron&quot;-Imperial armada, and much of the Imperial hierarchy are killed in action. The loss of the second Death Star and other invaluable Imperial naval assets, along with the deaths of Imperial leaders aboard, marked the beginning of the end of Imperial rule over the galaxy.

=== Successor ===
Following their victory at the Battle of Endor, a provisional New Republic was officially formed by Alliance members. This, combined with the Imperial power vacuum, political infighting, and &quot;Operation Cinder&quot;—Palpatine&#x27;s scorched earth contingency plan—encouraged thousands of inhabited planets to either declare independence from the collapsing Empire or defect to the Alliance.

The New Republic found itself with no shortage of recruits and resources: the declining popularity of the Empire pushed many long time Imperial loyalists to the Rebel cause, including those of Inferno Squadron, who after Operation Cinder, which saw the destruction of countless Imperial worlds, opened the eyes of many to the atrocities of the Empire. Even the most dedicated Imperials such as Inferno Squadron commander Iden Versio were moved to defect after the witnessing the destruction of her homeworld Vardos. Finally realizing the Empire&#x27;s propaganda had deceived them, many Imperials began to feel shame over their actions, in particular over the destruction of Alderaan.

Despite fact that the New Republic was now winning the war, had a lot more resources than before—and a lot more recruits—the New Republic was suffering from logistic nightmares. The decentralized structure that served them well became a liability; described as &quot;a ragtag force strategically ill-fed and cobbled together of incompatible ships and squadrons&quot;. The Alliance fleet shifted military doctrine; the guerrilla warfare aspect of the grand strategy was de-emphasized, and conventional forces took over the primary prosecution of the war. Once the New Republic became powerful enough, the Alliance fleet was reorganized into the New Republic Military, charged with the defense of the New Republic.

About a year after the Battle of Endor, the Rebellion defeated Imperial forces during the Battle of Jakku, formally established the New Republic government, and suspends offensive operations. Thus, the Galactic Civil War came to a close. Three decades later, by the time of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, the New Republic backed the Resistance army, a successor of the Alliance, to stand against the First Order, a new military power formed by hardline remnants from the Empire.

===&quot;Legends&quot;===

After Disney&#x27;s acquisition of the franchise, Lucasfilm announced in 2014 that previous works outside the theatrical films and &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; would no longer be considered canon, but began to be republished under the &quot;Legends&quot; banner.

*According to &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot;, the Cantham House Meetings of Coruscant, including the participation of Senators Mon Mothma and Bail Organa, take place with the purpose of discussing the formation of a Galactic Alliance in opposition to Palpatine&#x27;s Galactic Empire. In addition, the RPG tells that although throughout the galaxy many sectors are already fighting against Imperial interests, resistance is relatively quiet until the incident on the planet Ghorman, which takes place 18 years before the Battle of Yavin. The incident begins when an Imperial military cruiser commanded by Captain Wilhuff Tarkin is blocked by peaceful anti-Empire protesters who refuse to move off the ship&#x27;s landing pad. With implied permission from the Emperor, Tarkin lands the ship anyway, injuring and killing many, an incident that history would record as the Ghorman Massacre. The myriad of civilizations which are fighting the Empire continue to grow in number and progressively coalesce into a ragtag organization known as the Resistance. They intend upon removing the evil Emperor, but the growing ruthlessness of the Imperial state forces them into secrecy, as they are initially unable to undermine the Empire&#x27;s regime. The RPG tells that part of the strategy of the Rebel Alliance is the &quot;Doctrine of Space Denial&quot;, wherein the Rebellion would attack Imperial shipping frigates in hit and run raids, both to disrupt Imperial supplies and operations, and also to loot desperately needed materials. These Rebel starfighters were equipped with hyperdrive capability along prearranged routes which would allow this kind of harassment and escape before the Empire may react.
*The video game &quot;The Force Unleashed&quot; presents a differing view of the Alliance&#x27;s beginnings, hinting that the Emperor actually secretly pushed for its formation. Palpatine clandestinely bids for the creation of another opposing force, intent on starting yet another war in order to consolidate his power with the fledgling Empire, just as he had done earlier with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Emperor orders his apprentice Darth Vader to use his own secret apprentice, Galen Marek (called &quot;Starkiller&quot;), as a pawn to gather together the Empire&#x27;s enemies, manipulating him into believing that the intention is to start a rebellion. Vader quickly realizes that this is obviously a ploy by Palpatine in order to lure any significant rebels into a trap; however, it is unclear whether Vader (or the Emperor) had intended for the Rebellion to survive. At the supposedly secret meeting known as the Corellian Treaty, Mon Mothma, Bail Organa, Garm Bel Iblis, Jedi-General Rahm Kota, and others meet to formally create the Rebellion against the Empire. However, the proceedings are ambushed by Vader under orders from the Emperor, whom had actually secretly orchestrated the Treaty himself in order to gather all the Rebel leaders together and eliminate them. Starkiller, now aligned with the Rebellion after two betrayals by his former master, manages to save the principal founders from the Empire, though at the cost of his own life. Regrouping on Kashyyyk, the Senators formally proclaim an open &quot;Declaration of Rebellion&quot;, which states the grievances of the Empire against the Alliance to Restore the Republic and concludes with an open threat to depose the Emperor. This marks the formal &quot;founding&quot; of the Rebel Alliance, and Galen Marek&#x27;s family crest is chosen by Leia as its official symbol. Thus, the Rebel Alliance is effectively founded by Darth Vader himself, and, by extension, Emperor Palpatine, though it is clear neither had imagined that the Alliance would actually ever become a serious threat. The Galactic Civil War consequently ensues, during which the Rebellion confronts the Empire many times throughout the galaxy.
*&quot;Empire at War&quot; depicts various allies contributing secretly to the Alliance, slowly making the united Rebel Force more powerful. The most notable equipment contributions include the defection of the Incom Corporation staff and all relevant material involved in the development of an advanced spacefighter, the X-wing.
*A &quot;Declaration of Rebellion&quot; was depicted in the 1990 book &quot;The Star Wars Rebel Alliance Sourcebook&quot;.
*After its victory on Endor, the Rebellion was temporarily stationed there and renamed the &quot;Alliance of Free Planets&quot;.

<doc id="95871" wikidata="Q16597" url="?curid=95871" title="Jiang Zemin">
<text>Jiang Zemin (17 August 1926 – 30 November 2022) was a Chinese politician who served as general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 1989 to 2002, as chairman of the Central Military Commission from 1989 to 2004, and as president of China from 1993 to 2003. Jiang was the third paramount leader of China from 1989 to 2002. He was the core leader of the third generation of Chinese leadership, one of four core leaders alongside Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Xi Jinping.

Born in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Jiang joined the CCP while he was in college. After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, he received training at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow in the 1950s, later returning to Shanghai in 1962 to serve in various institutes, later being sent between 1970 and 1972 to Romania as part of an expert team to establish machinery manufacturing plants in the country. After 1979, he was appointed as the vice chair of two commissions by vice premier Gu Mu to oversee the newly established special economic zones (SEZs). He became the vice minister of the newly established Ministry of Electronics Industry and a member of the CCP Central Committee in 1982.

Jiang was appointed as the mayor of Shanghai in 1985, later being promoted to its Communist Party secretary, as well as a member of the CCP Politburo, in 1987. Jiang came to power unexpectedly as a compromise candidate following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, when he replaced Zhao Ziyang as CCP general secretary after Zhao was ousted for his support for the student movement. As the involvement of the Eight Elders in Chinese politics steadily declined, Jiang consolidated his hold on power to become the &quot;paramount leader&quot; in the country during the 1990s. Urged by Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s southern tour in 1992, Jiang officially introduced the term socialist market economy in his speech during the 14th CCP National Congress held later that year, which accelerated opening up and reform.

Under Jiang&#x27;s leadership, China experienced substantial economic growth with the continuation of market reforms. The returning of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 and of Macau from Portugal in 1999, and entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, were landmark moments of his era. China also witnessed improved relations with the outside world, while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the state. Jiang faced criticism over human rights abuses, including the crackdown on the Falun Gong movement. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the Three Represents, were written into the CCP constitution in 2002. Jiang gradually vacated his official leadership titles from 2002 to 2005, being succeeded in these roles by Hu Jintao, although he and his political faction continued to influence affairs until much later. In 2022, Jiang died at the age of 96 in Shanghai; he was accorded a state funeral.

== Early life ==

Jiang Zemin was born in the city of Yangzhou, Jiangsu, on 17 August 1926. His ancestral home was the Jiangcun Village () in Jingde County, Anhui. This was also the hometown of a number of prominent figures in Chinese academic and intellectual establishments. Jiang grew up during the years of Japanese occupation. His uncle and foster father, Jiang Shangqing, died fighting the Japanese and was considered in Jiang Zemin&#x27;s time to be a national hero. After Shangqing&#x27;s death, Zemin became his male heir.

Jiang attended the Department of Electrical Engineering at the National Central University in Japanese-occupied Nanjing before transferring to National Chiao Tung University (now Shanghai Jiao Tong University). He graduated there in 1947 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering. Jiang joined the Chinese Communist Party when he was in college. After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Jiang received his training at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow in the 1950s. He also worked for Changchun&#x27;s First Automobile Works. As Jiang became increasingly involved in the Communist Party, his main work shifted from the technical side of engineering to administrative and political tasks.

== Early career ==

In 1962, he returned to Shanghai and became the deputy director of the Shanghai Electric Research Institute. In 1966, he was appointed as the director and deputy party secretary of a thermal engineering research institute in Wuhan, which was established by the First Ministry of Machine Building. When the Cultural Revolution began in the same year, he did not suffer greatly during the turmoil, but was pulled down from his position as director of the institute and was sent to a May Seventh Cadre School. In 1970, after leaving the cadre school, he became the deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the ministry and was sent to the Socialist Republic of Romania, where he served as head of the expert team to establish fifteen machinery manufacturing plants in the country. After the completion of his mission in 1972, he returned to China.

In 1979, following a thawing of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, Deng Xiaoping decided to encourage special economic zones (SEZs) as part of his Four Modernizations. China&#x27;s State Council established two ministerial commissions to increase trade and foreign investment. The commissions were headed by vice premier Gu Mu, who appointed Jiang as vice chairman of both commissions, a position equivalent to vice minister. Jiang&#x27;s role was to ensure these SEZs increased economic prosperity without becoming &quot;conduits&quot; for foreign ideology. In 1980, Jiang headed a delegation which toured other SEZs in twelve countries; upon his return, he issued a radical report which recommended allowing local authorities to issue tax breaks and land leases, and increasing the power of foreign joint ventures. The report initially &quot;caused consternation&quot; among party leaders, but his pragmatic and empirical presentation appealed to Deng Xiaoping. His proposals were approved at the National People&#x27;s Congress, cementing Jiang as an &quot;early implementer&quot; of Deng Xiaoping Theory.

In March 1982, he was pushed out as vice chairman of two commissions. After pressure from premier Gu and Shanghai mayor Wang Daohan, &quot;ardent reformist&quot; Zhao Ziyang appointed Jiang as the first vice minister and party secretary of the newly established Ministry of Electronics Industry.

At the 12th Party Congress held in September 1982, Jiang became a member of the Central Committee of the CCP, which determines policy and elects the members of the Politburo.

== Career in Shanghai ==
In 1985, a political reshuffle took place in Shanghai. Party Secretary Chen Guodong and Mayor Wang Daohan were both removed due to age issues. Instead, Rui Xingwen became the new Party Secretary of Shanghai, and Jiang became new mayor of Shanghai. Jiang received mixed reviews as mayor. Many of his critics dismissed him as a &quot;flower pot&quot;, a Chinese term for someone who only seems useful, but actually gets nothing done. Many credited Shanghai&#x27;s growth during the period to Zhu Rongji. Jiang was an ardent believer, during this period, in Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s economic reforms. In an attempt to curb student discontent in 1986, Jiang recited the Gettysburg Address in English in front of a group of student protesters.

At the 13th National Congress of the CCP held in October 1987, Jiang was promoted from mayor to Shanghai party secretary, the most powerful position in the city, reporting directly to the central government. He also joined the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with customs for party secretaries of major cities.

=== Tiananmen Square protests and massacre ===
In April 1989, former general secretary Hu Yaobang died; he had previously been forced to resign in January 1987 and accused of supporting &quot;bourgeois liberalization&quot;. His death catalyzed the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, leading to an ideological crisis between &quot;liberals&quot; (who supported aggressive reforms) and &quot;conservatives&quot; (who favored slower change). After the Shanghai-based &quot;World Economic Herald&quot; tried to publish a eulogy rehabilitating Hu and praising his reformist stance, Jiang took control of the newspaper&#x27;s editorial board. As the protests continued to grow, the Party imposed martial law and deployed troops in Beijing in May. In Shanghai, 100,000 protestors marched in the streets, and 450 students went on a hunger strike. After the third day, Jiang personally met with them to assure them that the Party shared their goals, and to promise future dialogue. He simultaneously sent a telegram to the Central Committee firmly supporting their martial law declaration.

His careful public appeals were well received by both pro-democracy students and socialist party elders. On 20 May 1989, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping decided to appoint Jiang as the new general secretary, replacing Zhao Ziyang, who had supported the protestors. Jiang was selected as a compromise candidate over Tianjin&#x27;s Li Ruihuan, premier Li Peng, elders Li Xiannian, Chen Yun, and the retired elders to become the new general secretary. Before that, he had been considered to be an unlikely candidate.

== Rise to power ==
Jiang was appointed as general secretary at the fourth plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee on 24 June 1989 with a fairly small power base inside the party, and thus, very little actual power. His most reliable allies were the powerful party elders Chen Yun and Li Xiannian. He was believed to be simply a transitional figure until a more stable successor government to Deng could be put in place. Other prominent Party and military figures like President Yang Shangkun and his brother Yang Baibing were believed to be planning a coup.

At the first meeting of the new CCP Politburo Standing Committee, after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, Jiang criticized the previous period as &quot;hard on the economy, soft on politics&quot; and advocated increasing political thought work. Anne-Marie Brady wrote that &quot;Jiang Zemin was a long time political cadre with a nose for ideological work and its importance. This meeting marked the beginning of a new era in propaganda and political thought work in China.&quot; Soon after, the Central Propaganda Department was given more resources and power, &quot;including the power to go in to the propaganda-related work units and cleanse the ranks of those who had been supportive of the democracy movement.&quot;

The Politburo also issued a list of &quot;seven things&quot; regarding &quot;matters of universal concern to the masses&quot;, with party corruption as the top priority. Jiang was also appointed as the chairman of the Central Military Commission on 9 November 1989, succeeding Deng, and president of the PRC on 27 March 1993; this marked the start of the arrangement in which the paramount leader of China simultaneously serves as Party leader, president and chair of the CMC.

== Leadership ==
In the first few years, Jiang depended on the support of Deng Xiaoping to remain in power, which forced Jiang into an &quot;ultranationalist stance&quot; towards Taiwan and the US. Jiang had supported Deng&#x27;s calls against &quot;bourgeois liberalization&quot;, but while Jiang was seen as a &quot;thoughtful reformer&quot;, he &quot;[skewed] to the more conservative views of the elders and his Politburo colleagues&quot;. Deng was far more supportive of reforms, saying that &quot;deviating to the Left is an even greater danger&quot; than deviating to the right.

Deng grew critical of Jiang&#x27;s leadership in 1992. During Deng&#x27;s southern tour, he subtly suggested that the pace of reform was not fast enough. Jiang grew ever more cautious, and rallied behind Deng&#x27;s reforms completely. Jiang coined the new &quot;socialist market economy&quot; to move China&#x27;s centrally-planned socialist economy into essentially a government-regulated market economy. It was a huge step to take in the realization of Deng&#x27;s &quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot;. At the same time, Jiang elevated many of his supporters from Shanghai to high government positions, after regaining Deng&#x27;s confidence. He abolished the outdated Central Advisory Commission in 1992, an advisory body composed of revolutionary party elders.

=== Economic development ===
In the early 1990s, post-Tiananmen economic reforms by Vice Premier and later Premier Zhu Rongji with Jiang&#x27;s support had stabilized and the country was on a consistent growth trajectory. At the same time, China faced myriad economic and social problems. At Deng&#x27;s state funeral in 1997, Jiang delivered the elder statesman&#x27;s eulogy. Jiang had inherited a China rampant with political corruption, and regional economies growing too rapidly for the stability of the entire country. Deng&#x27;s policy that &quot;some areas can get rich before others&quot; led to an opening wealth gap between coastal regions and the interior provinces.

Jiang and Zhu initiated major reforms to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) during their tenure. Per the concept of grasping the large, letting go of the small, a number of heavy industries were deregulated and many small- and medium-sized SOEs were closed down or privatized, initially removing as many as 40 million jobs from SOEs. Jiang also oversaw the breaking of the iron rice bowl, allowing China to join the World Trade Organization in 2001. As a result of the reforms, unemployment rates skyrocketed, rising as high as 40% in some urban areas, and stock markets fluctuated greatly. The scale of rural migration into urban areas was unprecedented anywhere, and little was being done to address an ever-increasing urban-rural wealth gap. Official reports put the figure on the percentage of China&#x27;s GDP being moved and abused by corrupt officials at 10%.

Jiang&#x27;s biggest aim in the economy was stability, and he believed that a stable government with highly centralized power would be a prerequisite, choosing to postpone political reform, which in many facets of governance exacerbated the ongoing problems. After the coastal regions and SEZs were sufficiently developed, Jiang worked to reduce geographic disparities by encouraging richer cities to &quot;provide financial, technological, and managerial assistance to the poorer, western ones.&quot; Jiang put forward the plan for China&#x27;s western development. Construction of various infrastructure projects such as the Qinghai–Tibet railway and the Three Gorges Dam began under Jiang&#x27;s leadership. 

Jiang launched the Going Global policy in 1999, a national strategy which sought to develop national champion firms, increase foreign demand for Chinese goods and services, and secure energy and resources. This policy greatly expanded Chinese investment and influence in the global South, particularly in Africa and Asia.

During Jiang&#x27;s tenure, China adopted policies to expand its trade and economic relations with other countries through the Maritime Commerce Law (1993), Anti-Subsidy Rules (1997), and 2001 revisions to the Foreign Investment Law.

=== Foreign policy ===

Under Jiang&#x27;s leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping. China&#x27;s international behavior was generally both pragmatic and predictable. During Jiang&#x27;s presidency, serious flare-ups between China and the United States occurred. Nonetheless, Jiang&#x27;s foreign policy was for the most part passive and non-confrontational. Foreign policy under Jiang inherited from that of Deng Xiaoping, that is, &quot;taoguang yanghui&quot;, or &quot;hide one&#x27;s talent and bide one&#x27;s time&quot;, which emphasized the use of cooperative rhetoric and the avoidance of controversy.

In July 1993, the United States Navy stopped a Chinese container ship, the &quot;Yinhe&quot;, based on the incorrect suspicion that it was carrying chemical weapon precursors bound for Iran. Although China denied the allegation, the United States cut off the &quot;Yinhe&quot;″s GPS, causing it to lose direction and anchor on the high seas for twenty-four days until it acceded to an inspection. There were no chemical precursors on the ship. Although China sought a formal apology, the United States refused to apologize and refused to pay compensation. Despite the humiliation of the &quot;Yinhe&quot; incident, Jiang took a stance of goodwill towards the United States and adopted the &quot;sixteen-characters formula&quot; for working with the United States: &quot;enhancing confidence, reducing troubles, expanding cooperation, and avoiding confrontation.&quot;

Jiang oversaw a series of missile tests in the waters surrounding Taiwan in 1996 in protest to the Republic of China government under President Lee Teng-hui, who had been seen as moving its foreign policy away from the One-China policy. The United States sent two carrier groups to the vicinity of Taiwan, and the PRC de-escalated. As a result of the United States response, Jiang ordered the People&#x27;s Liberation Army to begin a ten-year modernization program.

Jiang went on a state visit to the United States in 1997, drawing various crowds in protest from the Tibet Independence Movement to supporters of the Chinese democracy movement. He made a speech at Harvard University, part of it in English, but could not escape questions on democracy and freedom. In the official summit meeting with president Bill Clinton, the tone was relaxed as they sought common ground while largely ignoring areas of disagreement. Clinton would visit China in June 1998, and vowed that China and the United States were partners in the world, and not adversaries.

After the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, Jiang seemed to have put up a harsh stance for show at home, but in reality only performed symbolic gestures of protest, and no solid action. Jiang deemed the United States-China bilateral relation too important to be harmed in the emotion of the moment and sought to soothe the Chinese public&#x27;s outrage.

The Hainan island incident was another tense event in the China-United States relations which occurred during Jiang&#x27;s presidency. On April 1, 2001, a United States US EP-3 surveillance aircraft collided mid-air with a Chinese Shenyang J-8 jet fighter over the South China Sea. China sought a formal apology, and accepted United States Secretary of State Colin Powell&#x27;s expression of &quot;very sorry&quot; as sufficient. The incident nonetheless created negative feelings towards the United States by the Chinese public and increased public feelings of Chinese nationalism.

A personal friend of former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien, Jiang strengthened China&#x27;s economic stature abroad, attempting to establish cordial relations with countries whose trade is largely confined to the American economic sphere.

=== Media depiction ===

The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; and CCTV&#x27;s 7 pm &quot;Xinwen Lianbo&quot; each had Jiang-related events as the front-page or top stories, a fact that remained until Hu Jintao&#x27;s media administrative changes in 2006. Jiang appeared casual in front of Western media, and gave an unprecedented interview with Mike Wallace of CBS in 2000 at Beidaihe. He would often use foreign languages in front of the camera; once, he gave a 40-minute speech entirely in Russian. In an encounter with Hong Kong reporter Sharon Cheung in 2000 regarding the central government&#x27;s apparent &quot;imperial order&quot; of supporting Tung Chee-hwa to seek a second term as Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Jiang scolded the Hong Kong journalists as &quot;too simple, sometimes naive&quot; in English.

=== Three Represents ===
On 25 February 2000, Jiang introduced the theory of Three Represents, which was later enshrined in both Party and State constitutions as an &quot;important thought&quot;, following in the footsteps of Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory. Officially termed as the latest development of socialism with Chinese characters under Jiang&#x27;s tenure, the Three Represents justified the incorporation of the new capitalist business class into the party, and changed the founding ideology of the CCP from protecting the interests of the peasantry and workers to that of the &quot;overwhelming majority of the people&quot;, a euphemism aimed at placating the growing entrepreneurial class. Conservative critics within the party, such as hardline leftist Deng Liqun, denounced this as betrayal of &quot;true&quot; communist ideology.

Before he transferred power to a younger generation of leaders, Jiang had his theory of Three Represents written into the Party&#x27;s constitution, alongside Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory at the 16th CCP Congress in 2002.

=== Crackdown on Falun Gong ===

In June 1999, Jiang established an extralegal department, the 610 Office, to crack down on Falun Gong. Cook and Lemish state this was because Jiang was worried that the popular new religious movement was &quot;quietly infiltrating the CCP and state apparatus.&quot; On 20 July, security forces arrested thousands of Falun Gong organizers they identified as leaders. The persecution that followed was characterized as a nationwide campaign of propaganda, as well as the large-scale arbitrary imprisonment and coercive reeducation of Falun Gong organizers, sometimes resulting in death due to mistreatment in detention.

== Retirement ==
In the run-up to the 16th National Congress of the CCP, Hu Jintao had &quot;almost unanimous support&quot; to become the new CCP general secretary. To maintain China&#x27;s image as a stable and respected country, Jiang and Hu emphasized their unity, striving to make this transition the first &quot;smooth and harmonious&quot; one in the PRC&#x27;s history. Jiang stepped down as general secretary and left the Politburo Standing Committee, but retained the chairmanship of the Central Military Commission, which controlled the army and the nation&#x27;s foreign policy. Jiang would continue counselling Hu from &quot;behind the curtain&quot;, and it was formally agreed that Jiang would be &quot;consulted on all matters of state importance&quot;. Both men also reached a &quot;tacit understanding&quot; that Hu would not be considered a &quot;core&quot; leader like Jiang, Deng and Mao.

At the 16th Party Congress, the majority of new members for Standing Committee were considered part of Jiang&#x27;s so-called &quot;Shanghai clique&quot;, the most prominent being vice president Zeng Qinghong, who had served as Jiang&#x27;s chief of staff for many years, and vice premier Huang Ju, a former party secretary of Shanghai.

After Hu succeeded Jiang as general secretary, the latter continued to &quot;[dominate] public life&quot; for several years. The &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; announced that &quot;a new era has begun in China. But it is not that of Vice President Hu Jintao [...] Rather, it is a new era of President Jiang Zemin, who has just stepped down as the Party&#x27;s general secretary.&quot; Early in the 2003 SARS crisis, Jiang remained conspicuously silent, and observers were divided over whether it signified his waning influence, or respect for Hu. It has been argued that the institutional arrangements created by the 16th Congress left Jiang in a position where he could not exercise much influence.

Although Jiang retained the chairmanship of the CMC, most members of the commission were professional military men. &quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Army Daily&quot;, a publication thought to represent the views of the CMC majority, printed an article on 11 March 2003 which quotes two army delegates as saying, &quot;Having one center is called &#x27;loyalty&#x27;, while having two centers will result in &#x27;problems. This was interpreted as a criticism of Jiang&#x27;s attempt to exercise dual leadership with Hu on the model of Deng Xiaoping.

On 19 September 2004, after the 4th Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee, Jiang, at the age of 78, relinquished his post as chairman of the party&#x27;s Central Military Commission, his last post in the party. Six months later in March 2005, Jiang resigned his last significant post, chairman of the Central Military Commission of the state, which marked the end of Jiang&#x27;s political career. This followed weeks of speculation that forces inside the party were pressing Jiang to step aside. Jiang&#x27;s term was supposed to have lasted until 2007. Hu also succeeded Jiang as the CMC chairman, but, in an apparent political defeat for Jiang, General Xu Caihou, and not Zeng Qinghong was appointed to succeed Hu as vice chairman, as was initially speculated. This power transition formally marked the end of Jiang&#x27;s era in China, which roughly lasted from 1989 to 2004.

In 2008, Jiang published an academic article on China&#x27;s clean energy resources and another on China&#x27;s information technology development.

=== Official appearances after retirement ===
Jiang continued to make official appearances after giving up his last title in 2005. In China&#x27;s strictly defined protocol sequence, Jiang&#x27;s name always appeared immediately after Hu Jintao&#x27;s and in front of the remaining sitting members of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee. In 2007, Jiang was seen with Hu Jintao on stage at a ceremony celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, and toured the Military Museum of the Chinese People&#x27;s Revolution with Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and other former senior officials. On 8 August 2008, Jiang appeared at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. He also stood beside Hu Jintao during the mass parade celebrating the 60th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in October 2009.

Beginning in July 2011, false reports of Jiang&#x27;s death began circulating on the news media outside of mainland China and on the internet. While Jiang may indeed have been ill and receiving treatment, the rumors were denied by official sources. On 9 October 2011, Jiang made his first public appearance since his premature obituary in Beijing at a celebration to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution. Jiang reappeared at the 18th Party Congress in October 2012, and took part in the 65th Anniversary banquet of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in October 2014. At the banquet he sat next to Xi Jinping, who had then succeeded Hu Jintao as CCP general secretary. In September 2015, Jiang attended the parade celebrating 70 years since end of World War II; there, Jiang again sat next to Xi Jinping and Hu Jintao. He appeared on 29 May 2017 at Shanghai Technology University.

After Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, Jiang&#x27;s position in the protocol sequence of leaders retreated; while he was often seated next to Xi Jinping at official events, his name was often reported after all standing members of the Communist Party&#x27;s Politburo. Jiang reappeared at the 19th Party Congress on 18 October 2017. He appeared on 29 July 2019 at the funeral of former premier Li Peng. He also attended the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China mass parade in October 2019, marking his last public appearance prior to his death. He did not attend the 20th Party Congress in October 2022.

== Family and personal life ==
Jiang married Wang Yeping, also a native of Yangzhou, in 1949. She was his cousin, as Jiang&#x27;s adoptive mother was Wang&#x27;s aunt. Wang graduated from Shanghai International Studies University. They had two sons together, Jiang Mianheng and Jiang Miankang. Jiang Mianheng went on to be an academic and businessman, working within the Chinese space program, and founded Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation.

It is believed that Jiang had a long-running friendship with the singer Song Zuying, Chen Zhili, and others. Following the rise of Xi Jinping, Song and other Jiang loyalists, including her brother Song Zuyu, fell under investigation for corruption.

Jiang had a passable command of several foreign languages, including English and Russian. Jiang remains the only paramount leader of China known to be able to speak in English. He enjoyed engaging foreign visitors in small talk on arts and literature in their native language, in addition to singing foreign songs in their original languages. In 1987, he sang &quot;When We Were Young&quot; and danced with Dianne Feinstein, who was mayor of San Francisco at the time. Jiang also played the ukulele during his 1997 visit to Hawai&#x27;i.

== Death ==
Jiang died on 30 November 2022, at the age of 96, in Shanghai. According to the Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency, he died at 12:13 pm from leukemia and multiple organ failures. On the day of Jiang&#x27;s death, the government released a notice that the national flags would be flown half-staff in key locations of Beijing and diplomatic missions abroad. Foreigners were not invited to attend official mourning activities.

Jiang&#x27;s body was cremated at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery and his ashes were scattered near the mouth of the Yangtze River.

== Legacy ==

The policies of his successors, Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, have widely been seen as efforts to address perceived imbalances and move away from a sole focus on economic growth toward a broader view of development which incorporates non-economic factors such as health and the environment.

Domestically, Jiang&#x27;s legacy and reputation is mixed. While some people attributed the period of relative stability and growth in the 1990s to Jiang&#x27;s term, others argue that Jiang did little to correct systemic imbalance and an accumulation of problems which resulted from years of breakneck-pace economic reforms, leaving the next administration facing innumerable challenges, some of which may have been too late to solve.

The fact that Jiang rose to power as the direct beneficiary of the political aftermath of Tiananmen has shaped the perception of his rule. Following the Tiananmen protests, Jiang threw his support behind elder Chen Yun&#x27;s conservative economic policies, but subsequently changed his allegiance to Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s reform-oriented agenda following the latter&#x27;s &quot;Southern Tour&quot;. This shift was not only seen as the exercise of a political opportunist, it also sowed confusion among party loyalists in regards to what direction the party was headed or what the party truly believed in. While continued economic reforms resulted in an explosion of wealth around the country, it also led to the formation of special interest groups in many sectors of the economy, and the exercise of state power without any meaningful oversight. This opened the way for the sub-optimal distribution of the fruits of growth, and an expanding culture of corruption among bureaucrats and party officials.

Historian and former Xinhua journalist Yang Jisheng wrote that Jiang might well have been given a positive historical assessment had it not been for his decision to &#x27;overstay his welcome&#x27; by remaining in the Central Military Commission post after Hu had formally assumed the party leadership. Moreover, Jiang took credit for all the gains made during the 13 years &quot;between 1989 and 2002&quot;, which not only evoked the memories of Jiang being a beneficiary of Tiananmen, but also neglected the economic foundations laid by Deng, whose authority was still paramount until the mid-1990s. Additionally, Jiang was also criticized for his insistence on writing the &quot;Three Represents&quot; into the party and state constitutions (see below), which Yang called Jiang&#x27;s attempt at &quot;self-deification&quot;, i.e., that he saw himself as a visionary along the same lines as Deng and Mao. Yang contended, &quot;The &#x27;Three Represents&#x27; is just common sense. It is not a proper theoretical framework. It&#x27;s what any ruler would tell the people to justify the continued rule of the governing party.&quot;

Jiang did not specialize in economics, and in 1997 handed most of the economic governance of the country to premier Zhu Rongji and remained in office through the Asian financial crisis. Under their joint leadership, Mainland China sustained an average of 8% GDP growth annually, achieving the highest rate of per capita economic growth in major world economies, raising eyebrows around the world with its astonishing speed. This was mostly achieved by continuing the process of a transition to a market economy. Additionally, he helped increase China&#x27;s international standing with China joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 and Beijing winning the bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Some have also associated Jiang with the widespread corruption and cronyism that had become a notable feature of the Communist power apparatus since Jiang&#x27;s years in power. In the military, the two vice-chairmen who sat atop the Central Military Commission hierarchy – nominally as assistants to then chairman Hu Jintao – Vice Chairmen Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, were said to have obstructed Hu Jintao&#x27;s exercise of power in the military. Xu and Guo were characterized as &quot;Jiang&#x27;s proxies in the military&quot;. Eventually, both men were reported to have taken massive bribes, and both fell under the axe of the anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping.

At the same time, many biographers of Jiang have noted his government resembled an oligarchy as opposed to an autocratic dictatorship. Many of the policies of his era had been attributed to others in government, notably premier Zhu Rongji. Jiang was also characterized as a leader who was mindful to seek the opinion of his close advisers. Jiang is often credited with the improvement in foreign relations during his term, but at the same time many Chinese have criticized him for being too conciliatory towards the United States and Russia. The issue of Chinese unification between the mainland and Taiwan gained ground during Jiang&#x27;s term.

<doc id="95873" wikidata="Q1452" url="?curid=95873" title="Basilicata">
<text>Basilicata (, ; ), also known by its ancient name Lucania (, , ), is an administrative region in Southern Italy, bordering on Campania to the west, Apulia to the north and east, and Calabria to the south. It has two coastlines: a 30-kilometre stretch on the Tyrrhenian Sea between Campania and Calabria, and a longer coastline along the Gulf of Taranto between Calabria and Apulia. The region can be thought of as the &quot;arch&quot; of the &quot;boot&quot; of Italy, with Calabria functioning as the &quot;toe&quot; and Apulia the &quot;heel&quot;.

The region covers about . In 2021, the population was slightly over 540,000. The regional capital is Potenza. The region comprises two provinces: Potenza and Matera. Its inhabitants are generally known as Lucanians (), and to a lesser extent as or by other very rare terms.

In ancient times part of its territory belonged to Magna Graecia, subject to coastal Greek colonies (including Sybaris). Later the region was conquered by the ancient Romans. It was then conquered by the Byzantines, and then by the Normans around the year 1000 with the Hauteville family. Their presence explains the persistence of the Gallo-Italic linguistic enclaves of Basilicata. The area was later dominated by the Aragonese and by the Spanish. Subsequently, it became part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, before annexation to the unified Kingdom of Italy (proclaimed in 1861) after the 1860 Expedition of the Thousand.

==Etymology==
The name probably derives from &quot;basilikos&quot; (), which refers to the &quot;basileus&quot;, the Byzantine emperors, who ruled the region for 200 years, from 536/552 to 571/590 and from 879 to 1059. Others argue that the name may refer to the Basilica of Acerenza, which held judicial power in the Middle Ages.

During the ancient Greek and Roman eras, Basilicata was known as Lucania. This was possibly derived from &quot;leukos&quot; (Greek: λευκός), meaning &quot;white&quot;, from &quot;lykos&quot; (Greek: λύκος), meaning &quot;wolf&quot;, or from Latin &quot;lūcus&quot;, meaning &quot;sacred wood&quot;. More probably, the name Lucania derived, like the forename (&quot;praenomen&quot;) Lucius, from the Latin word &quot;Lux&quot; (gen. &quot;lucis&quot;), meaning &quot;light&quot; (from PIE &quot;*leuk-&quot;, &quot;brightness&quot;, also the root of the Latin verb &quot;lucere&quot;, &quot;to shine&quot;), which is a cognate of the name Lucas. Another proposed etymology is a derivation from the Etruscan word &quot;Lauchum&quot; (or &quot;Lauchme&quot;), meaning &quot;king&quot;, which passed into Latin as &quot;Lucumo&quot;.

==Geography==
Basilicata covers an extensive part of the southern Apennine Mountains, between the Ofanto river in the north and the Pollino massif in the south. It is bordered on the east by a large part of the Bradano river depression, which is traversed by numerous streams and declines to the southeastern coastal plains on the Ionian Sea. The region also has a short coastline to the southwest on the Tyrrhenian Sea side of the peninsula.

Basilicata is the most mountainous region in the south of Italy, with 47% of its area of covered by mountains. Of the remaining area, 45% is hilly, and 8% is made up of plains. Notable mountains and ranges include the Pollino massif, the Dolomiti lucane, Monte Vulture, Monte Alpi, Monte Carmine, Monti Li Foj and Toppa Pizzuta.

Geological features of the region include the volcanic formations of Monte Vulture, and the seismic faults in the Melfi and Potenza areas in the north, and around Pollino in the south. Much of the region was devastated in the 1857 Basilicata earthquake. More recently, the 1980 Irpinia earthquake destroyed many towns in the northwest of the region.

The mountainous terrain combined with weak rock and soil types makes landslides prevalent. The lithological structure of the substratum and its chaotic tectonic deformation predispose the slope to landslides, and this problem is compounded by the lack of forested land. In common with many another Mediterranean region, Basilicata was once rich in forests, but they were largely felled and made barren during the time of Roman rule.

The variable climate is influenced by three coastlines (Adriatic, Ionian and Tyrrhenian) and the complexity of the region&#x27;s physical features. In general, the climate is continental in the mountains and Mediterranean along the coasts.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The first traces of human presence in Basilicata date to the late Paleolithic, with findings of &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. Late Cenozoic fossils, found at Venosa and other locations, include elephants, rhinoceros and species now extinct such as a saber-toothed cat of the genus &quot;Machairodus&quot;. Examples of rock art from the Mesolithic have been discovered near Filiano. From the fifth millennium, people stopped living in caves and built settlements of huts up to the rivers leading to the interior (Tolve, Tricarico, Aliano, Melfi, Metaponto). In this period, anatomically modern humans lived by cultivating cereals and animal husbandry (Bovinae and Caprinae). Chalcolithic sites include the grottoes of Latronico and the funerary findings of the Cervaro grotto near Lagonegro.

The first known stable market center of the Apennine culture on the sea, consisting of huts on the promontory of , near to Maratea, dates to the Bronze Age. The first indigenous Iron Age communities lived in large villages in plateaus located at the borders of the plains and the rivers, in places fitting their breeding and agricultural activities. Such settlements include that of Tursi, known at the time as Anglona, located between the fertile valleys of Agri and Sinni, of Siris and, on the coast of the Ionian Sea, of Incoronata-San Teodoro. The first presence of Greek colonists, coming from the Greek islands and Anatolia, date from the late eighth century BC.

There are virtually no traces of survival of the 11th–8th century BC archaeological sites of the settlements (aside from a necropolis at Castelluccio on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea): this was perhaps caused by the increasing presence of Greek colonies, which changed the balance of the trades.

===Ancient history===

In ancient historical times, the region was originally known as Lucania, named for the Lucani, an Oscan-speaking population from central Italy.

Starting from the late eighth century BC, the Greeks established a settlement first at Siris, founded by fugitives from Colophon. Then with the foundation of Metaponto from Achaean colonists, they started the conquest of the whole Ionian coast. There were also indigenous Oenotrian foundations on the coast, which exploited the nearby presence of Greek settlements, such as Velia and Pyxous, for their maritime trades. The region became one of the centers of Magna Graecia, with the foundation along its coasts of many Greek city-states (póleis).

The first contacts between the Lucanians and the Romans date from the latter half of the fourth century BC. After the conquest of Taranto in 272, Roman rule was extended to the whole region: the Appian Way reached Brindisi and the colonies of Potentia (modern Potenza) and Grumentum were founded.

===Middle Ages===

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Basilicata fell to Germanic rule, which ended in the mid-6th century when the Byzantines reconquered it from the Ostrogoths between 536 and 552 during the apocalyptic Byzantine-Gothic war under the leadership of Byzantine generals Belisarius and Narses. The region, deeply Christianized since as early as the 5th century, became part of the Lombard Duchy of Benevento founded by the invading Lombards between 571 and 590.

In the following centuries, Saracen raids led part of the population to move from the plain and coastal settlements to more protected centers located on hills. The towns of Tricarico and Tursi were under Muslim rule for a short period: later the &quot;Saracen&quot; population would be expelled. The region was conquered once more for Byzantium from the Saracens and the Lombards in the late 9th century, with the campaigns of Nikephoros Phokas the Elder and his successors, and became part of the theme of Longobardia. In 968 the &quot;theme&quot; of Lucania was established, with the capital at Tursikon (Tursi).

In the 11th century, Basilicata, together with the rest of much of southern Italy, was conquered by the Normans. Melfi became the first capital of the County of Apulia (later County of Apulia and Calabria) in 1043, where Robert Guiscard was named &quot;Duke&quot; by Pope Nicholas II. Inherited by the Hohenstaufen, Frederick II reorganized the administrative structure of his predecessors and the Justiciarate of Basilicata, whose borders coincided almost entirely with the actual region, was created. In Melfi, the Emperor promulgated the &quot;Liber Augustalis&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Constitutions of Melfi&quot;), code of laws for the Kingdom of Sicily. The Swabians were ousted in the 13th century by the Capetian House of Anjou. Since then, Basilicata began to lose importance and was marked by an irreversible socio-political decline.

===Modern and contemporary times===

In 1485, Basilicata was the seat of plotters against King Ferdinand I of Naples, the so-called &quot;conspiracy of the Barons&quot;, which included the Sanseverino of Tricarico, the Caracciolo of Melfi, the Gesualdo of Caggiano, the of Altamura and Venosa and other anti-Aragonese families. Later, Charles V stripped most of the barons of their lands, replacing them with the Carafa, Revertera, Pignatelli and Colonna among others. After the formation of the Neapolitan Republic (1647), Basilicata also rebelled, but the revolt was suppressed. In 1663 a new province was created in Basilicata with its capital in Matera.

The region came under the dominion of the House of Bourbon in 1735. Basilicata autonomously declared its annexation to the Kingdom of Italy on August 18, 1860, with the Potenza insurrection. It was during this period that the state confiscated and sold off vast tracts of Basilicata&#x27;s territory formerly owned by the Catholic Church. As the new owners were a handful of wealthy aristocratic families, the average citizen did not see any immediate economic and social improvements after unification, and poverty continued unabated.

This gave rise to the phenomenon of brigandage, which actually turned into a civil war in the form of a guerrilla fighting, whereby the Bourbon in exile and the Church encouraged the peasants to rise up against the Kingdom of Italy. This strong opposition movement continued for many years. The revolt in Basilicata was led by Carmine Crocco, who was the most important chief in the region and the most impressive band leader in southern Italy.

It was only really after World War II that things slowly began to improve thanks to land reform. In 1952, the inhabitants of the Sassi di Matera were rehoused by the state, but many of Basilicata&#x27;s population had emigrated or were in the process of emigrating, which led to a demographic crisis from which it is still recovering.

==Demographics==

Although Basilicata has never had a large population, there have nevertheless been quite considerable fluctuations in the demographic pattern of the region. In 1881, there were 539,258 inhabitants but by 1911 the population had decreased by 11% to 485,911, mainly as a result of emigration overseas. There was a slow increase in the population until World War II, after which there was a resurgence of emigration to other countries in Europe, which continued until 1971 and the start of another period of steady increase until 1993 (611,000 inhabitants). Since the 1990s the population has been declining again, as a result of low birth rates and high emigration, especially towards northern Italy, the UK, Germany and Switzerland. As of 2024, the population was 533,636, a 12.7% decrease since 1993.

The population density is very low compared to that of Italy as a whole: 59.1 inhabitants per km2 compared to 200.4 nationwide in 2010. There is not a great difference between the population densities of the provinces of Matera and Potenza.

Religion, particularly Roman Catholicism still maintains a solid role in the culture and everyday lives of people in Basilicata. Italian National Statistical Institute (ISTAT) in 2018 found that 24.9% of the population went weekly to church, synagogue, mosque, temple or other place of worship, with the share of practicing believers higher in Basilicata (27.9%)

==Government and politics==
==Administrative divisions==

Basilicata is divided into two provinces:

==Economy==

Cultivation consists mainly of sowables (especially wheat), which represent 46% of the total land. Potatoes and maize are produced in the mountain areas. Olives and wine production is relatively small with about under cultivation. The terrain is mountainous and hilly with poor transportation routes that hinders harvesting. Most oils are sold unbranded and only 3% is exported. The main olive cultivars are Ogliarola del Vulture, Ogliarola del Bradano, Majatica di Ferrandina and Farasana with only Ogliarola del Vulture having the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). Other varieties are the Arnasca, Ascolana, Augellina, Cellina, Frantoio, Leccino, Majatica, Nostrale, Ogliarola (Ogliarola Barese), Palmarola or Fasolina, Rapolese di Lavello, and Sargano (Sargano di Fermo and Sargano di San Benedetto).

Among industrial activities, the manufacturing sector contributes to the gross value added of the secondary sector with 64% of the total, while the building sector contributes 24%. Within the services sector, the main activities in terms of gross value added are business activities, distributive trade, education and public administration. In the last few years, new productive sectors have developed: manufacturing, automotive, and especially oil extraction. In 2009, Eni employed 230 people in this area (of whom over 50% were from Basilicata), and about 1,800 were employed in activities directly generated by Eni&#x27;s operations, distributed in 80 companies of which over 50% were from Basilicata. The region produced about , meeting 11 percent of Italy&#x27;s domestic oil demand.

FIAT plant in Melfi has 7,200 employees and manufactured 229,848 Jeep Renegade, Jeep Compass and Fiat 500X in 2020.

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 12.6 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 0.7% of Italy&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 22,200 euros or 74% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 95% of the EU average.

The unemployment rate stood at 8.6% in 2020, the lowest rate in South Italy.

==Tourism==
Difficult accessibility and lack of extended promotion make Basilicata one of the most remote and least visited regions of Italy. However, tourism is slowly growing since the early 2000s. Matera, once dubbed &quot;national disgrace&quot; by prime minister Alcide De Gasperi who urged to take strict development measures due to its extreme poverty, is now Basilicata&#x27;s main attraction and has gained fame worldwide for its historical center, the Sassi, designated in 1993 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2019, Matera was designated as the European Capital of Culture.

Seaside tourism is mainly concentrated in Maratea, nicknamed &quot;The Pearl of Tyrrhenian Sea&quot;, but also the Ionian coast (Policoro, Pisticci, Bernalda, Nova Siri) is fairly developed. Naturalistic attractions include Pollino, that hosts the largest national park in Italy, Dolomiti lucane and Vulture. &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked Basilicata third in its list of &quot;52 Places to Go in 2018&quot;, describing it as &quot;Italy&#x27;s best-kept secret&quot;.
===Archeological sites===

Basilicata has a variety of archeological sites containing traces of Prehistoric, Greek, Roman and Jewish heritage:
*Civita, Tricarico
*Grumentum
*Heraclea
*Metapontum
*Jewish catacombs of Venosa
*Notarchirico
*Petre de la Mola
*Serra di Vaglio

===Religious buildings===
Basilicata hosts a series of religious structures. The Abbey of Santissima Trinità, Venosa, is one of the most representative, which includes marks of Roman, early Christian, Romanesque, Lombard and Norman origin. It was chosen by Robert Guiscard as the Hauteville family&#x27;s burial (and he himself will be later buried there too). Other relevant religious buildings are:
*Acerenza Cathedral
*Irsina Cathedral
*Matera Cathedral
*Melfi Cathedral
*Pierno Abbey, San Fele
*Potenza Cathedral

===Castles===

Of many castles that existed in the region, mostly isolated towers and ruins have survived. The Melfi castle is perhaps the most iconic, where important events from the Middle Age took place, such as the five councils between the Normans and the Catholic Church and the constitutions of Melfi promulgated by Frederick II. The Malconsiglio castle, Miglionico, hosted the conspiracy of the Barons against Ferrante of Aragon.
Among the other best preserved castles of the region are:
*Bernalda castle
*Lagopesole castle
*Laurenzana Castle
*Muro Lucano castle
*Tramontano Castle
*Venosa castle

===Other sights===
Basilicata has many small and picturesque villages, nine of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities. 

However, they have to face depopulation problems, while others such as Craco and Campomaggiore saw their old sites abandoned due to natural disasters. Nonetheless, filmmakers, writers and musicians have contributed to give a boost to the rebirth of Craco, making it one of the most popular ghost towns in the world.

Other historical and distinctive villages are:
*Accettura
*Acerenza
*Aliano 
*Castelmezzano 
*Guardia Perticara 
*Pietrapertosa
*Rivello
*Rotondella
*Satriano di Lucania
*Valsinni 
*Viggianello

==Culture==

===Art===

Cave paintings were found in the Tuppo dei Sassi site (or Ranaldi shelter, after its discoverer Francesco Ranaldi, archaeologist and museum director), a prehistoric site in the Filiano territory, considered the oldest artistic trace in Basilicata. During the Greek colonisation era, artists like the Pisticci Painter and the Amykos Painter operated in the area of Metaponto around the 5th century BC. Metaponto is one of the largest and earliest Greek centres of vase painting in Italy; the Lucanian vase painting began around 430 BC, with the works of the Pisticci Painter. In the Armento area the Kritonios Crown and the Armento Rider were found, now exposed in Munich and London respectively.

The Jewish catacombs of Venosa are cited among the most significant signs of the Jewish presence in southern Italy. Around the 7th century, basilian monks settled in Basilicata, leaving a high concentration of rupestrian churches (155 ascertained today), in Matera, Pollino and the Agri and Sinni Valleys. Frescoes from the Angevin period can be found in the Abbey of the Santissima Trinità of Venosa, the Rupestrian churches of S. Mary of the Valley in Matera, S. Antuono in Oppido Lucano, S. Lucia in Rapolla and S. Margherita in Melfi.

The stone Nativity scene by Altobello Persio (1534) in the Matera Cathedral is an early example of Renaissance art in the region. Later Basilicata saw the imported and imitated art phenomenon with artists such as Giovanni Bellini and Cima da Conegliano, and Flemish painting by Dirck Hendricksz, Guglielmo Borremans, Aert Mijtens among the others. Local painters such as Giovanni De Gregorio, Andrea Miglionico and Carlo Sellitto had a Neapolitan school background. An alleged portrait of Leonardo da Vinci, dating back to the 1500s, was discovered in 2008, today exhibited in the Museo delle Antiche genti di Lucania, Vaglio.

Some artists from the 19th century include Vincenzo Marinelli, Giacomo Di Chirico and Michele Tedesco. Several contemporary artists gained fame outside Italy, among them are worth to mention Marino Di Teana, Eugenio Santoro and Joseph Stella, sometimes cited as the first futurist painter in America. During his exile under the fascist regime, Carlo Levi, a painting passionate, left many works, today exposed in Matera.

===Music===
Although Basilicata hosted classical composers such as Carlo Gesualdo and Egidio Romualdo Duni, the region is primarily identified in popular music, which reflects the humble living conditions of its inhabitants. The &quot;arpa viggianese&quot; (commonly known as &quot;arpicedda&quot;) is a typical harp from Viggiano of average size, with a thin and light structure that makes it easier to carry; it was the distinctive instrument of street musicians from the Val d&#x27;Agri area in the past centuries, who wandered around the world and many of whom were admitted to symphony orchestras. Today, Viggiano is remembered as the &quot;City of Harp and Music&quot;. Other traditional instruments are cupa cupa, zampogna and ciaramella.

During the emigration wave of the late 19th century, some composers gained recognition in North America: Leonardo De Lorenzo, flautist of several American philharmonic orchestras and professor at the Eastman School of Music, regarded as one of the most eminent flute pedagogues of the 1900s; Carlo Curti, who helped to popularize the mandolin in the United States and Mexico, and founder of the &quot;Orquestra Típica Mexicana&quot;, considered the &quot;predecessor of the Mariachi bands&quot;. Comedy duo Lyons and Yosco became popular for their million-selling ragtime piece &quot;Spaghetti Rag&quot;.

Modern pop artists such as Mango and Arisa achieved great success in the Italian music scene. Since the mid-1990s, Basilicata hosts the Agglutination Metal Festival, one of the most long-lived heavy metal events in Europe.

===Cinema===
Since the post–World War II era, Basilicata has become a set for many national and international film productions. Matera is the most coveted film location, especially for biblical-themed movies, being often compared with the ancient Jerusalem. Other locations include the ghost town of Craco, Melfi and Maratea. The region hosted, among the others, the filming of &quot;Il Demonio&quot; (1963), &quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot; (1964), &quot;Christ Stopped at Eboli&quot; (1979), &quot;I&#x27;m Not Scared&quot; (2003), &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004), &quot;The Omen&quot; (2006), &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; (2008), &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2017), &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021).

Some actors and film directors are from Basilicata, most notably Robert G. Vignola, a prominent figure of the silent era, Pasquale Festa Campanile, associated with the &quot;commedia all&#x27;italiana&quot; genre, Ruggero Deodato, known for his horror films such as the controversial &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;. Tanio Boccia, Rocco Papaleo, Antonio Gerardi, Antonio Petrocelli, Alessandra Di Sanzo are other notable personalities in the Italian movie industry.

===Cuisine===
The local cuisine is mostly based on pork and sheep meat, legumes, cereals, vegetables and tubers. It is commonly referred to as , deeply anchored in peasant traditions. Bread crumb is considered a poor-man&#x27;s cheese substitute, sprinkled over pasta dishes and used as a seasoning for meat and vegetables. Horseradish is often used as a spice and condiment, which is referred to as &quot;poor man&#x27;s truffle&quot;. The peperone crusco (PAT) is a specialty of the regional cuisine, sometimes labeled as &quot;the red gold of Basilicata&quot;. It is the dried form of the peperone di Senise (PGI), one of the most popular Italian pepper varieties. Traditional recipes include pasta dishes like &quot;pasta con i peperoni cruschi&quot; and &quot;tumact me tulez&quot;, and main courses such as &quot;rafanata&quot;, &quot;acquasale&quot;. &quot;Pastizz&quot; and &quot;falagone&quot; are common street foods.

Basilicata is best known for the Lucanica di Picerno (PGI) pork sausage that derives from lucanica, an ancient recipe originated before the Roman empire. Pane di Matera (PGI) is a type of bread recognizable for its intense flavour and conical shape, as well as long preservation. Other principal products are cheeses like pecorino di Filiano (PDO), canestrato di Moliterno (PGI), padraccio (PAT) and treccia dura (PAT); vegetables like melanzana rossa di Rotonda (PDO); and legumes like fagiolo di Sarconi (PGI) and fagiolo bianco di Rotonda (PDO). The region is also known for its naturally sparkling mineral water that springs from the streams of Mount Vulture. Alcoholic beverages include Aglianico del Vulture, considered one of Italy&#x27;s top red wines, and Amaro Lucano liqueur.

<text>Ferndale is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit on the Woodward Corridor, Ferndale borders Detroit to the north, roughly northwest of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 19,190.

Ferndale is well-known for its downtown, as well as its position as the hub of the LGBTQ+ community in Metro Detroit, and a center of progressive politics.

== History ==
Native Americans were original inhabitants of the area now known as the City of Ferndale. In the 1800s farmers began cultivating the land. After the invention of the automobile and the development of the automotive assembly line, the population of Ferndale increased rapidly.

Ferndale was incorporated into a village in 1918. It was then incorporated into a city on March 7, 1927, by vote of the citizens of the village. It became a bedroom community for Detroit workers, with most of its growth in housing from 1920 to 1951. Through the early 1950s there were trolley (interurban railroad) lines in the median strip of Woodward Avenue from downtown Detroit to Pontiac. These helped the northern suburbs of Detroit grow as bedroom communities as people could take the trolley to shop or work in Detroit.

In the 1970s, the Ferndale suburban community emerged as a place for families to raise children during the &quot;Baby Boom&quot; era, with its elementary schools, a downtown, city parks, active churches and civic groups. Ferndale High was completed in 1958.

Ferndale&#x27;s downtown shopping area, 9 Mile Road, featured many busy, popular stores in the 1940s to 1960s, but later went into decline, and many businesses closed. In recent decades, the downtown area has revitalized. Ferndale&#x27;s downtown is formed by two major thoroughfares, Nine Mile Road and Woodward Avenue. Circa 1997 the city made the downtown more pedestrian-friendly by narrowing West Nine Mile Road, the heart of the downtown, to one lane in each direction and adding on-street parking. The result has been a return of pedestrian traffic and an influx of new stores and restaurants. The city has continued to make itself more accessible to people by reducing traffic lanes on Hilton Road and Pinecrest Road, two major local north/south streets, and adding bicycle lanes.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Ferndale is adjacent to the cities of Detroit to the south, Oak Park to the west, Hazel Park to the east, Pleasant Ridge to the north, Royal Oak Township to the southwest, and Royal Oak to the north.

Ferndale is bordered to the south by 8 Mile Road, to the north (west of Woodward Avenue) by Oakridge Street, and (east of Woodward Avenue) by 10 Mile Road and I-696. To the west it is bordered by Republic Street (south of Nine Mile Road), and Hyland Street (north of Nine Mile). To the east it is bordered by West End, Pilgrim Street, and Lennox Street.

== Government ==
Ferndale utilizes the council-manager form of government, and is governed by a city council consisting of a mayor and four council members. The city council appoints a city manager, who manages the day-to-day operations of the city. The current mayor of Ferndale is Raylon Leaks-May. Current city council members are Greg Pawlica, Laura Mikulski, Rolanda Kelley and Donnie Johnson. The current city manager is Joseph Gacioch.

<text>The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is a nonprofit public utility created in November 1934 by the Texas Legislature. LCRA&#x27;s mission is to enhance the lives of the Texans it serves through water stewardship, energy and community service. LCRA provides public power, manages the lower Colorado River, builds and operates transmission lines, owns public parks, and offers community services.

LCRA does not receive state appropriations or have the ability to levy taxes. Instead, LCRA is funded by revenue it generates, the vast majority of which comes from producing and transmitting electricity. A very small portion of LCRA&#x27;s revenue comes from selling water.

==Power generation portfolio==
===Coal===
The Fayette Power Project is a three-unit coal-fired power plant in Fayette County that provides 1,625 megawatts (MW). (Austin Energy co-owns two of the units and the power they produce.) Lake Fayette is the cooling pond for the project. LCRA uses coal from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming as fuel.

===Natural gas===
The Sim Gideon Power Plant is a three-unit natural gas-fired plant in Bastrop County that provides 608 megawatts. The Lost Pines 1 Power Project (owned and operated by GenTex Power Corporation, an LCRA affiliate) is a natural gas-fired combined-cycle plant adjacent to the Sim Gideon plant, and the two form the Lost Pines Power Park. The Lost Pines 1 Power Project can generate up to 511 megawatts. Lake Bastrop is the cooling pond for the Lost Pines Power Park.

LCRA broke ground on a new Thomas C. Ferguson Power Plant in April 2012, about 100 yards from the site of the original Ferguson plant on Lake LBJ. The plant began operating in 2014. The old plant was decommissioned. The Ferguson facility is a natural gas-fired, combined cycle plant in Horseshoe Bay capable of producing 540 megawatts. Ferguson is among the most environmentally responsible power plants in Texas, producing 30 to 40 percent fewer emissions per unit of power than the unit it replaced. It uses about 35 percent less fuel per megawatt-hour and about one-third of the water used at a typical steam plant per unit of power.

The Winchester Power Park in Fayette County provides about 176 megawatts for use primarily during peak-demand periods.

The LCRA buys natural gas on the open market and stores it at the Hilbig Gas Storage Facility, an underground reservoir near Rockne, Texas. The facility can hold up to 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas.

===Hydroelectric===
LCRA operates six hydroelectric dams along the Colorado River in Central Texas that provide a source of renewable energy and form six lakes collectively known as the Texas Highland Lakes:

*Buchanan Dam (54.9 MW) - forms Lake Buchanan
*Inks Dam (13.8 MW) - forms Inks Lake
*Wirtz Dam (60 MW) - forms Lake LBJ, which also serves as a cooling pond for the Thomas C. Ferguson Power Plant
*Max Starcke Dam (41.4 MW) - forms Lake Marble Falls
*Mansfield Dam (108 MW) - forms Lake Travis
*Tom Miller Dam (17 MW) - forms Lake Austin

In keeping with its state-approved Water Management Plan, LCRA generates electricity from the dams only as it releases water for other reasons, or when ordered to do so by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

===Wind===
LCRA purchases 51 megawatts of wind power capacity from the Indian Mesa Wind Energy Center in West Texas and 200 megawatts from the Papalote Creek II Wind Farm near the Texas Gulf Coast.

===Transmission===
LCRA distributes electricity to its wholesale electric customers - mostly municipal utilities and electric cooperatives - and supports the statewide electric transmission network through more than 5,100 miles of transmission lines and more than 380 substations, which are owned by LCRA Transmission Services Corporation, a nonprofit corporation owned by LCRA.

== Water ==
LCRA manages the Highland Lakes and the lower Colorado River, a 600 mi stretch of the Texas Colorado River, as a system to supply water for more than 1 million people as well as businesses, industries, the environment and agriculture in the lower Colorado River basin.

LCRA has the rights to more than 2.1 million acre-feet of water per year based mostly on surface water permits issued by the state of Texas.

==Parks and community services==

LCRA owns more than 40 public parks, recreation areas and river access sites along the Highland Lakes and lower Colorado River. LCRA&#x27;s McKinney Roughs Nature Park and Matagorda Bay Nature Parks have natural science centers that offer outdoor educational and recreational programs for youths and adults.

LCRA offers a wide range of conservation programs for water users within its river basin. It also operates an environmental laboratory, monitors the water quality of the lower Colorado River, and regulates on-site sewage systems to limit pollution and help protect the health of those enjoying the Highland Lakes.

LCRA&#x27;s community services programs include the Community Development Partnership Program, which has awarded almost $42 million in matching grants for 1,491 community development projects since 1995.

==History==
In November 1934, the Texas Legislature authorized the formation of the Lower Colorado River Authority to complete Buchanan Dam, where construction had been idled in 1932 following the financial collapse and bankruptcy of the Samuel Insull-controlled public utility holding company. LCRA began operations in February 1935.

LCRA completed Buchanan Dam and a companion project, Inks Dam, in 1938—the first of six dams that form the reservoirs known as the Highland Lakes. LCRA completed the chain of lakes and dams in 1951. LCRA manages the chain to protect basin residents from the worst effects of Hill Country floods and provide the lower Colorado River basin with a reliable water supply.

With the encouragement of congressman, Lyndon B. Johnson, LCRA used the hydroelectric power from its dams in 1936 to launch a public power program that served communities and electric cooperatives in Central and South Texas.

For nearly three decades, hydroelectric generation was LCRA&#x27;s primary power source. Growing demand for electricity led LCRA to build natural gas and coal-fired power plants. LCRA added to its generation portfolio with the Sim Gideon Power Plant and original Thomas C. Ferguson Power Plant in the 1960s and 1970s, the Fayette Power Project in the 1970s and 1980s, the Lost Pines 1 Power Project in 2001 and the Winchester Power Project in 2010.

In 1995, LCRA became the first electric utility in Texas to provide wind-generated electricity to its customers from the Texas Wind Power Project, the first such project in the state. LCRA continues to evaluate additional renewable energy options that complement its existing generation portfolio.

LCRA&#x27;s water and community services operations have grown through the years. LCRA began programs in the 1970s and 1980s to control water pollution and monitor water quality. It expanded its parks operations beginning in the 1990s to increase public access to the Highland Lakes and lower Colorado River. LCRA also worked with communities in its service area on projects designed to boost communities&#x27; economic development and improve their local quality of life.

<doc id="95881" wikidata="Q29053369" url="?curid=95881" title="Esperanto orthography">
<text>Esperanto is written in a Latin-script alphabet of twenty-eight letters, with upper and lower case. This is supplemented by punctuation marks and by various logograms, such as the digits 0–9, currency signs such as $ € ¥ £ ₷, and mathematical symbols. The creator of Esperanto, L. L. Zamenhof, declared a principle of &quot;one letter, one sound&quot;, though this is a general rather than strict guideline.

Twenty-two of the letters are identical in form to letters of the English alphabet (&quot;q, w, x,&quot; and &quot;y&quot; being omitted). The remaining six have diacritical marks: &quot;ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ,&quot; and &quot;ŭ&quot; – that is, &quot;c, g, h, j,&quot; and &quot;s circumflex,&quot; and &quot;u breve.&quot;

== Standard alphabet ==
Standard Esperanto orthography uses the Latin script.

=== Sound values ===

The letters have approximately the sound values of the , with the exception of &quot;c&quot; and the letters with diacritics: &quot;ĉ&quot; , &quot;ĝ&quot; , &quot;ĥ&quot; , &quot;ĵ&quot; , &quot;ŝ&quot; , &quot;ŭ&quot; . &quot;J&quot; transcribes two allophonic sounds, consonantal (the English &quot;y&quot; sound, as in &quot;you&quot;) and vocalic .

There is a nearly one-to-one correspondence of letter to sound. For those who consider to be a phoneme, Esperanto contains one consonantal digraph, . Beside the dual use of , allophony is found in place assimilation of and , the latter of which for example is frequently pronounced before &quot;g&quot; and &quot;k&quot;.

Phonemic change is perhaps limited to voicing assimilation, as in the sequence &quot;kz&quot; of &quot;ekzemplo&quot;, (&#x27;(an) example&#x27;) which is frequently pronounced . In Zamenhof&#x27;s writing, obstruents with different voicing do not meet in compound words, but rather are separated by an epenthetic vowel such as &quot;o&quot;, to avoid this effect.

Non-Esperantized names are given an Esperanto approximation of their original pronunciation, at least by speakers without command of the original language. Hard is read as &quot;k&quot;, as &quot;kv&quot;, as &quot;v&quot;, as &quot;ks&quot;, and as &quot;j&quot; if a consonant, or as &quot;i&quot; if a vowel. The English digraph is read as &quot;t&quot;. When there is no close equivalent, the difficult sounds may be given the Esperanto values of the letters in the orthography or roman transcription, accommodating the constraints of Esperanto phonology. So, for example, &quot;Winchester&quot; (the English city) is pronounced (and may be spelled) &quot;Vinĉester&quot; , as Esperanto &quot;ŭ&quot; does not occur at the beginning of ordinary words. &quot;Changzhou&quot; generally becomes &quot;Ĉanĝo&quot; , as Esperanto has no &quot;ng&quot; or &quot;ou&quot; sound. There are no strict rules, however; speakers may try for greater fidelity, for example by pronouncing the &quot;g&quot; and &quot;u&quot; in &quot;Changzhou&quot;: &quot;Ĉangĝoŭ&quot; (despite there being no &quot;g&quot; sound in the Chinese pronunciation). The original stress may be kept, if it is known.

=== Origin ===

The script resembles Western Slavic Latin alphabets but uses circumflexes instead of carons for the letters &quot;ĉ&quot;, &quot;ĝ&quot;, &quot;ĥ&quot;, &quot;ĵ&quot;, and &quot;ŝ&quot;. Also, the non-Slavic bases of the letters &quot;ĝ&quot; and &quot;ĵ&quot;, rather than Slavic &quot;dž&quot; and &quot;ž&quot;, help preserve the printed appearance of Latinate and Germanic vocabulary such as &quot;ĝenerala&quot; &quot;general&quot; (adjective) and &quot;ĵurnalo&quot; &quot;journal&quot;. The letter &quot;v&quot; stands for either &quot;v&quot; or &quot;w&quot; of other languages. The letter &quot;ŭ&quot; of the diphthongs &quot;aŭ&quot; and &quot;eŭ&quot; resemble the Belarusian Łacinka alphabet.

Zamenhof took advantage of the fact that typewriters for the French language (which, in his lifetime, served as an international &quot;lingua franca&quot; for educated people) possess a dead key for the circumflex diacritic: thus, anyone who could avail himself of a French typewriter could type &quot;ĉ ĝ ĥ ĵ ŝ&quot; and their uppercase counterparts with no problem. French typewriters also include the letter , which Francophone Esperantists have long used as a substitute for Esperanto &quot;ŭ&quot;. With the advent of personal computers, French-language keyboards still possess a dead-key ^, but whether it can be used to type Esperanto consonants may depend on the underlying software. Zamenhof&#x27;s choice of accented letters was familiar to the speakers of some Slavic languages, for instance, Czech and Slovak, where the sounds of Esperanto &quot;ĉ&quot; and &quot;ŝ&quot; are represented by the letters &quot;č&quot; and &quot;š&quot;, respectively; and Belarusian, because Esperanto &quot;ŭ&quot; bears the same relation to &quot;u&quot; as Belarusian Cyrillic &quot;ў&quot; bears to &quot;у&quot;.

Geographic names may diverge from English spelling, especially for the letters &quot;x&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;qu&quot; and &quot;gu&quot;, as in &quot;Vaŝintono&quot; &quot;Washington, D.C.&quot;, &quot;Meksiko&quot; &quot;Mexico City&quot;, and &quot;Gvatemalo&quot; &quot;Guatemala&quot;. Other spelling differences appear when Esperanto words are based on the pronunciation rather than the spelling of English place names, such as &quot;Brajtono&quot; for Brighton.

=== Variations ===
Since all letters with diacritics are unique, they are often simplified in handwriting. The most common diacritic to be simplified is the circumflex, which often appears more like a macron or acute accent (e.g. &quot;ḡ&quot; or &quot;ǵ&quot; instead of &quot;ĝ&quot;).

=== Names of the letters of the alphabet ===
Zamenhof simply tacked an &quot;-o&quot; onto each consonant to create the name of the letter, with the vowels representing themselves: &quot;a, bo, co, ĉo, do, e, fo,&quot; etc. The diacritics are frequently mentioned overtly. For instance, &quot;ĉ&quot; may be called &quot;ĉo ĉapela&quot; or &quot;co ĉapela,&quot; from &quot;ĉapelo&quot; (a hat), and &quot;ŭ&quot; may be called &quot;ŭo luneta&quot; or &quot;u luneta,&quot; from &quot;luno&quot; (a moon) plus the diminutive &quot;-et-.&quot; This is the only system that is widely accepted and in practical use.

The letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet not found in the Esperanto alphabet have distinct names, much as letters of the Greek alphabet do. , , are &quot;kuo, ikso, ipsilono&quot;; has been called &quot;duobla vo&quot; (double V), &quot;vavo&quot; (using Waringhien&#x27;s name of &quot;va&quot; below), &quot;vuo&quot; (proposed by Sergio Pokrovskij), &quot;germana vo&quot; (German V), and &quot;ĝermana vo&quot; (Germanic V).

However, while this is fine for initialisms such as &quot;ktp&quot; [kotopo] for &quot;etc.,&quot; it can be problematic when spelling out names. For example, several consonantal distinctions are difficult for many nationalities, who normally rely on the fact that Esperanto seldom uses these sounds to distinguish words (that is, they do not form many minimal pairs). Thus the pairs of letter names &quot;ĵo–ĝo, ĥo–ho&quot; (or &quot;ĥo–ko), co–ĉo&quot; (or &quot;co–so, co–to), lo–ro&quot;, and &quot;ŭo–vo&quot; (or &quot;vo–bo&quot;) are problematic. In addition, over a noisy telephone connection, it quickly becomes apparent that voicing distinctions can be difficult to make out: noise confounds the pairs &quot;po–bo, to–do, ĉo–ĝo, ko–go, fo–vo, so–zo, ŝo–ĵo,&quot; as well as the nasals &quot;mo–no.&quot;

There have been several proposals to resolve this problem. Gaston Waringhien proposed changing the vowel of voiced obstruents to &quot;a&quot;, so that at least voicing is not problematic. Also changed to &quot;a&quot; are &quot;h, n, r&quot;, distinguishing them from &quot;ĥ, m, l&quot;. The result is perhaps the most common alternative in use:

::&quot;a, ba, co, ĉo, da, e, fo, ga, ĝa, ha, ĥo, i, jo, ĵa, ko, lo, mo, na, o, po, ra, so, ŝo, to, u, ŭo, va, za&quot;
However, this still requires overt mention of the diacritics, and even so does not reliably distinguish &quot;ba–va, co–so, ĉo–ŝo,&quot; or &quot;ĝa–ĵa&quot;.

The proposal closest to international norms (and thus the easiest to remember) that clarifies all the above distinctions is a modification of a proposal by Kálmán Kalocsay. As with Zamenhof, vowels stand for themselves, but it follows the international standard of placing vowel &quot;e&quot; after a consonant by default &quot;(be, ce, de, ge),&quot; but before sonorants &quot;(el, en)&quot; and voiceless fricatives &quot;(ef, es).&quot; The vowel &quot;a&quot; is used for and the voiceless plosives , , , after the international names &quot;ha&quot; for and &quot;ka&quot; for ; the French name &quot;ĵi&quot; is used for , the Greek name &quot;ĥi (chi)&quot; for , and the English name &quot;ar&quot; for . The letter has the &quot;i&quot; vowel of &quot;ĵi,&quot; distinguishing it from , but the other voiced fricative, , does not, to avoid the problem of it palatalizing and being confused with &quot;ĵi.&quot; The diphthong offglide is named &quot;eŭ,&quot; the only real possibility given Esperanto phonotactics besides &quot;aŭ,&quot; which, as the word for &quot;or&quot;, could cause confusion. The letter is called &quot;om&quot; to distinguish it from ; the vowel &quot;o&quot; alliterates well in the alphabetical sequence &quot;el, om, en, o, pa.&quot; There are other patterns to the vowels in the ABC rhyme: The lines start with &quot;a i a i&quot; and finish with &quot;a a e e.&quot; The letters with diacritics are placed at the end of the rhyme, taking the place of &quot;w, x, y&quot; in other Latin alphabets, so as not to disrupt the pattern of letters many people learned as children. All this makes the system more easily memorized than competing proposals. The modified Kalocsay abecedary is:

:::::&quot;a, be, ce, de, e, ef, ge, ha,&quot;
:::::&quot;i, je, ka, el, om, en, o, pa,&quot;
:::::&quot;ar, es, ta, u, vi, ĉa, ĝe,&quot;
:::::&quot;ĥi kaj ĵi, eŝ, eŭ kaj ze,&quot;
:::::&quot;plus ku&#x27;, ikso, ipsilono,&quot;
:::::&quot;jen la abece-kolono.&quot;

&quot;(kaj&quot; means &quot;and&quot;. The last line reads: &quot;here is the ABC column)&quot;

Where letters are still confused, such as &quot;es&quot; vs &quot;eŝ&quot; or &quot;a&quot; vs &quot;ha,&quot; mention can be made of the diacritic &quot;(eŝ ĉapela),&quot; or to the manner of articulation of the sound &quot;(ha brueta&quot; &quot;breathy aitch&quot;). Quite commonly, however, people will use the &quot;aitch as in house&quot; strategy used in English.

=== Spelling alphabets ===
Another strategy is to use a spelling alphabet (&quot;literuma alfabeto&quot;), which substitutes ordinary words for letters. The following words are sometimes seen:

From a German–Esperanto dictionary by Erich-Dieter Krause:

:&quot;Asfalto, Barbaro, Centimetro, Ĉefo, Doktoro, Elemento, Fabriko, Gumo, Ĝirafo, Hotelo, Ĥaoso, Insekto, Jubileo, Ĵurnalo, Kilogramo, Legendo, Maŝino, Naturo, Oktobro, Papero, Kuo, Rekordo, Salato, Ŝilingo, Triumfo, Universo, Universo-hoketo, Vulkano, Ĝermana vo, Ikso, Ipsilono, Zinko&quot;

A proposal by Simon Edward Adrian Payne in &quot;Monato&quot;:

A proposal by Gerrit François Makkink, in which most words are tetrasyllabic so that the syllable beginning with the letter in question receives secondary stress (though only in &quot;Varsovio&quot; do both stressed syllables begin with the letter):
:&quot;Akademio, bondeziro, centjariĝo, Ĉe-metodo, delegito, Esperanto, Fundamento, gramatiko, ĝisrevido, harmonio, ĥorkantado, internacia, jubileo, ĵurnalisto, kalendaro, Ludoviko, modernigo, necesejo, okupita, propagando, kuo, redaktoro, sekretario, ŝatokupo, telefono, universala, u-supersigno, Varsovio, vuo, ikso, ipsilono, Zamenhofo&quot;

The International League of Esperantist Radio Amateurs (ILERA) uses the following adaptation of the International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet (ICAO and NATO &quot;phonetic&quot; alphabet):
:&quot;alfa, bravo, carli, delta, eko, fokstrot, golf, hotel, india, juliet, kilo, lima, majk, november, oskar, papa, kebek, romeo, siera, tango, uniform, viktor, ŭiski&quot; ~ &quot;viski, eksrej, janki, zulu&quot;

ILERA also modifies the numerals &quot;ses&quot; &#x27;6&#x27; and &quot;sep&quot; &#x27;7&#x27; to &quot;sis&quot; and &quot;sepen&quot; to make them more distinct, and uses the nominal form &quot;nulo&quot; for zero.

=== ASCII transliteration ===

There are two common conventions for inputting and typesetting Esperanto in the ISO basic Latin alphabet when proper orthography is inconvenient. Zamenhof had suggested replacing the circumflex letters with digraphs in &quot;h&quot;, the so-called &quot;h-system&quot;, thus: &quot;ch, gh, hh, jh, sh&quot; for &quot;ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ&quot; and &quot;u&quot; for &quot;ŭ&quot;, with an apostrophe or hyphen to disambiguate actual sequences of these letters (e.g. &quot;ses-hora&quot;). With the advent of computer word-processing, the so-called &quot;x-system&quot;, with digraphs in &quot;x&quot; for all diacritics, has become equally popular: &quot;cx, gx, hx, jx, sx, ux&quot;. The words &quot;ŝanĝi&quot; &quot;to change&quot; and &quot;ĵaŭde&quot; &quot;on Thursday&quot; are written &quot;shanghi&quot;, &quot;jhaude&quot; and &quot;sxangxi&quot;, &quot;jxauxde&quot;, respectively, in the two systems. The h-system has a more conventional appearance, but because the letter &quot;x&quot; does not occur in Esperanto, it is fairly straightforward to automatically convert text written in the x-system into standard orthography; it also produces better results with alphabetic sorting.

== Punctuation ==
As with most languages, punctuation is not completely standardized, but in Esperanto there is the additional complication of multiple competing national traditions.

Commas are frequently used to introduce subordinate clauses (that is, before &quot;ke&quot; &quot;that&quot; or the &quot;ki-&quot; correlatives):
:&quot;Mi ne scias, kiel fari tion.&quot; (I don&#x27;t know how to do that.)
The comma is also used for the decimal point, while thousands are separated by non-breaking spaces: &quot;,&quot; or sometimes by apostrophes: &quot;Li enspezis $3&#x27;300&#x27;000.&quot;

The question mark (?) and the exclamation mark (!) are used at the end of a clause and may be internal to a sentence. Question words generally come at the beginning of a question, obviating the need for Spanish-style inverted question marks.

Periods may be used to indicate initialisms: &quot;k.t.p.&quot; or &quot;ktp&quot; for &quot;kaj tiel plu&quot; (et cetera), but not abbreviations that retain the grammatical suffixes. Instead, a hyphen optionally replaces the missing letters: &quot;D-ro&quot; or &quot;Dro&quot; for &quot;Doktoro&quot; (Dr). With ordinal numerals, the adjectival &quot;a&quot; and accusative &quot;n&quot; may be superscripted: &quot;13a&quot; or &quot;13a&quot; (13th). The abbreviation &quot;k&quot; is used without a period for &quot;kaj&quot; (and); the ampersand (&amp;) is not found. Roman numerals are also avoided.

The hyphen is also occasionally used to clarify compounds, and to join grammatical suffixes to proper names that haven&#x27;t been Esperantized or don&#x27;t have a nominal &quot;-o&quot; suffix, such as the accusative on &quot;Kalocsay-n&quot; or &quot;Kálmán-on.&quot; The proximate particle &quot;ĉi&quot; used with correlatives, such as &quot;ĉi tiu&quot; &#x27;this one&#x27; and &quot;ĉi tie&quot; &#x27;here&#x27;, may be poetically used with nouns and verbs as well &quot;(ĉi jaro&quot; &#x27;this year&#x27;, &quot;esti ĉi&quot; &#x27;to be here&#x27;), but if these phrases are then changed to adjectives or adverbs, a hyphen is used: &quot;ĉi-jare&quot; &#x27;this year&#x27;, &quot;ĉi-landa birdo&quot; &#x27;a bird of this land&#x27;.

Quotation marks show the greatest variety of any punctuation. The use of Esperanto quotation marks was never stated in Zamenhof&#x27;s work; it was assumed that a printer would use whatever was available, usually the national standard of the printer&#x27;s country. Em dashes (—...), guillemets ( or reversed ), double quote marks ( and German-style ) and more are all found. Since the age of word-processing, however, American-style quotation marks are the most widespread. Quotations may be introduced with either a comma or a colon.

Time and date format is not standardized among Esperantists, but internationally unambiguous formats such as 1970-01-01 (ISO) or 1-jan-1970 are preferred when the date is not spelled out in full (&quot;la 1-a de januaro 1970&quot;).

=== Capitalization ===
Capitalization is used for the first word of a sentence and for proper names when used as nouns. Names of months, days of the week, ethnicities, languages, and the adjectival forms of proper names are not typically capitalized &quot;(anglo&quot; &quot;an Englishman&quot;, &quot;angla&quot; &quot;English&quot;, &quot;usona&quot; &quot;US American&quot;), though national norms may override such generalizations. Titles are more variable: both the Romance style of capitalizing only the first word of the title and the English style of capitalizing all lexical words are found.

All capitals or small capitals are used for acronyms and initialisms of proper names, like &quot;TEJO,&quot; but not common expressions like &quot;ktp&quot; (etc.). Small capitals are also a common convention for family names, to avoid the confusion of varying national naming conventions: Kálmán, Leslie Kwok-wing.

Camel case, with or without a hyphen, may occur when a prefix is added to a proper noun: &quot;la geZamenhofoj&quot; (the Zamenhofs), &quot;pra-Esperanto&quot; (Proto-Esperanto). It is also used for Russian-style syllabic acronyms, such as the name &quot;ReVo&quot; for &quot;Reta Vortaro&quot; (&quot;Internet Dictionary&quot;), which is homonymous with &quot;revo&quot; (dream). Occasionally mixed capitalization will be used for orthographic puns, such as &quot;espERAnto,&quot; which stands for the &quot;esperanta radikala asocio&quot; (Radical Esperanto Association).

Zamenhof contrasted informal &quot;ci&quot; with formal, and capitalized, &quot;Vi&quot; as the second-person singular pronouns. However, lower-case &quot;vi&quot; is now used as the second-person pronoun regardless of number.

== Spesmilo symbol ==
Unique to the Esperanto script is the &quot;spesmilo&quot; (1000 specie) sign, , an &quot;Sm&quot; monogram for an obsolete international unit of auxiliary Esperanto currency used by a few British and Swiss banks before World War I. It is often transcribed as &quot;Sm&quot;, usually italic.

== Braille, fingerspelling, and Morse code ==

Esperanto versions of braille and Morse code include the six diacritic letters.

An Esperanto braille magazine, &quot;Aŭroro,&quot; has been published since 1920.

In Morse code, a dot is added to C and J to derive Ĉ and Ĵ, a dash–dot is added to G and S to derive Ĝ and Ŝ, a dash is added to U to derive Ǔ, and the four dots of H are changed to four dashes for Ĥ. However, users often substitute these novel letters with digraphs &quot;ch, gh, jh, sh&quot; etc.

There is a proposed manual alphabet as part of the &quot;Signuno&quot; project. Signuno, as a signed variant of Esperanto, is itself a manual logographic Esperanto orthography. The majority of letters of the manual alphabet resemble those of the American manual alphabet, but also of the French manual alphabet and others. The diacritic letters Ĉ, Ĝ, Ĥ, Ĵ, Ŝ, Ŭ have their own signs, and J and Z are distinct from other alphabets, as none of the Signuno letters involve motion.
Digits are formed by extending the fingers from the index to the pinkie for 1 to 4, from the pinkie to the thumb (keeping the middle finger down) for 6 to 9, and from the thumb to index for 11 and 12; the last two are used for months and hours. Zero is represented by the fist, 5 by the whole hand extended, and 10 as the letter X.

== Other scripts ==

The Shavian alphabet, which was designed for English, was modified for use with Esperanto by John Wesley Starling. Though not widely used, at least one booklet has been published with sample Shavian texts. Not all letters are equivalent to their English values, and special forms of the letters and have been added for the accusative case ending and verbal inflections; the grammatical endings and the words &quot;la&quot; &#x27;the&#x27;, &quot;aŭ&quot; &#x27;or&#x27; and &quot;kaj&quot; &#x27;and&#x27; are written as ligatures.

The vowels necessarily differ from English. Esperanto &quot;a e i o u&quot; take the letters for English , with more regard to graphic symmetry than phonetic faithfulness in the cases of &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot;. &quot;C&quot; takes the letter for , the Castilian value of &quot;c&quot; before &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;ĥ&quot; that for , the inverse of the letter for . The most divergent letters are those for &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, which are in English, but which are graphically better suited to be distinct letters than English Shavian .

The US television series &quot;Resident Alien&quot; uses an invented script that does not distinguish &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, and ignores diacritics, to transcribe Esperanto as the alien language. It is written right to left.
The Cyrillic script has also been adapted to write Esperanto.
The 2017 Japanese-language visual novel &quot;The Expression Amrilato&quot; and its 2021 sequel &quot;Distant Memoraĵo&quot; feature a language named &quot;Juliamo&quot; that is actually Esperanto in a modified Latin alphabet.

== Computer input ==

The Esperanto alphabet is part of the Latin-3 and Unicode character sets, and is included in WGL4.
The code points and HTML entities for the Esperanto characters with diacritics and the spesmilo sign are:

<text>Jesus Ernesto Gonzales Jr (born October 3, 1984) is a Mexican-American former professional boxer. Gonzales was the NABF and IBF North American Super Middleweight Champion. Gonzales was considered by boxing critics to be one of the top amateur medal contenders for the United States in the 2004 Summer Olympics.

==Amateur career==
Gonzales&#x27; decorated amateur career includes wins over 2004 Olympic Gold Medalist and later WBA World Super Middleweight Champion Andre Ward; WBO Light Middleweight Champion Alfredo Angulo; IBA Intercontinental Light Middleweight champion Sechew Powell; and an astonishing four wins over former WBC Welterweight Champion Andre Berto.

In addition, Gonzales won the National Boxing Championship in the middleweight division in 2002, including the Outstanding Boxer Award.

==Professional career==
Widely considered to be America&#x27;s top medal contender for the 2004 Olympic Games, Gonzales stunned fans on June 12, 2003 when he decided to bypass the games and turn pro at the age of 18. Signing to Top Rank under promoter Bob Arum for $30,000, with another $30,000 from manager Cameron Dunkin. Gonzales was touted as the next Oscar De La Hoya. Over the next two years Gonzales fought 17 fights including two of the fastest knockouts in the history of boxing: 16 seconds over Josh Peters and a 17 seconds over Bobby Green while climbing to a 17-0 record.

Against the advice of his trainer/father on September 17, 2005 Gonzales became one of the youngest fighters ever (age 20) to fight for the Vacant IBC Middleweight Title. Gonzales suffered an eighth round knockout by former IBC Middleweight Champion José Luis Zertuche.

After this crucial fight, Top Rank&#x27;s Peter McKinn climbed into the ring and had a short conversation with Jesus&#x27; trainer/father Ernie Gonzales Sr. That conversation ended with Ernie Gonzales Sr. delivering a left hook to the side of McKinn&#x27;s face.

Jesus was unable to get a fight for nearly a year but had vowed to avenge his loss. He finally got the opportunity August 18, 2005 against Fernando Vela. Six victories later, Jesús found himself fighting for the Interim WBC Continental Americas Light Middleweight title on May 1, 2008. With a 12 round unanimous decision, Jesus became the WBC Continental Americas Light Middleweight Champion at the age of 22 with a record of 24-1.

Several weeks later, Jesus signed his second contract with Star Boxing in New York. With Star holding the rights to Jesus over his head and refusing to pay him, Jesus was forced into a two-year hiatus. For the second time in his career, his climb to the top was shattered over a bad contract and Jesus was forced to resign his WBC Continental Americas Light Middleweight title because of non-defense. Crushed and struggling to support his son, Jesús was forced to take a security job at a local high school to make ends meet.

Gonzales was discovered by Fan Base promotions while they were on a trip to Arizona to train one of their prized Canadian fighters. He was at a local gym tearing up the speed bag and Fan Base immediately noticed his outstanding talent. Fan Base put up the money and legal team to release Gonzales from his Star contract and immediately got him a fight in Canada against top Canadian contender Jason Naugler. After TKO’ing Naugler in the second round, Jesús was granted an opportunity to fight for the IBF N. American Super Middleweight Title in his hometown of Phoenix, Arizona.

In March 2011, Jesus defeated Dhafir Smith in a unanimous decision to become the IBF North American Super Middleweight Champion. He was only 26 years old then and vowed not to stop until he achieved a World Title.

===NABF Super Middleweight Championship===
Jesus became the new NABF Super Middleweight Champion, by beating tough veteran Francisco Sierra on July 8, 2011 at US Airways Center in Phoenix, Arizona. This bout was televised on ESPN2. In the fight there were two knockdowns, one by each fighter. Gonzales was named the winner by unanimous decision after 12 rounds.

===IBF Inter-Continental Super Middleweight Championship===

In 2012, Adonis Stevenson brutally knocked out González in the first round with his signature straight left hand. The knock out was a candidate for KO of the year by Ring Magazine. Prior to the fight, González famously had exposed Stevenson&#x27;s criminal past. This would turn out to be González last ever fight.

<doc id="95888" wikidata="Q900947" url="?curid=95888" title="James Smithson">
<text>James Smithson (c. 1765 – 27 June 1829) was a British chemist and mineralogist. He published numerous scientific papers for the Royal Society during the early 1800s as well as defining calamine, which would eventually be renamed after him as &quot;smithsonite&quot;. He was the founding donor of the Smithsonian Institution, which also bears his name.

Born in Paris, France, as the illegitimate child of Elizabeth Hungerford Keate Macie and Hugh Percy (born Hugh Smithson), the 1st Duke of Northumberland, he was given the French name Jacques-Louis Macie. His birth date was not recorded and the exact location of his birth is unknown; it is possibly in the Pentemont Abbey. Shortly after his birth he naturalized to Britain where his name was anglicized to James Louis Macie. He adopted his father&#x27;s original surname of Smithson in 1800, following his mother&#x27;s death. He attended university at Pembroke College, Oxford in 1782, eventually graduating with a Master of Arts in 1786. As a student he participated in a geological expedition to Scotland and studied chemistry and mineralogy. Highly regarded for his blowpipe analysis and his ability to work in miniature, Smithson spent much of his life traveling extensively throughout Europe; he published some 27 papers in his life.

Smithson never married and had no children; therefore, when he wrote his will, he left his estate to his nephew, or his nephew&#x27;s family if his nephew died before Smithson. If his nephew were to die without heirs, however, Smithson&#x27;s will stipulated that his estate be used &quot;to found in Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men&quot;. He died in Genoa, Italy, on 27 June 1829, aged 64. Six years later, in 1835, his nephew died without heir, setting in motion the bequest to the United States. In this way Smithson became the patron of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., despite having never visited the United States.

==Early life==
James Smithson was born in c. 1765 to Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland and Elizabeth Hungerford Keate Macie. His mother was the widow of John Macie, a wealthy man from Weston, Bath. An illegitimate child, Smithson was born in secret in Paris, resulting in his birth name being the Francophone Jacques-Louis Macie (later altered to James Louis Macie). In 1801 when he was about 36, after the death of his again-widowed mother, he changed his last name to Smithson, the original surname of his biological father. (Baronet Hugh Smithson had changed his surname to Percy when he married Lady Elizabeth Seymour, already a baroness and indirect heiress of the Percy family, one of the leading landowning families of England).

James was educated and eventually naturalised in England. He enrolled at Pembroke College, Oxford in 1782 and graduated in 1786 with an MA. The poet George Keate was a first cousin once removed, on his mother&#x27;s side.

Smithson was nomadic in his lifestyle, travelling throughout Europe. As a student, in 1784, he participated in a geological expedition with Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond, William Thornton and Paolo Andreani to Scotland and especially the Hebrides. He was in Paris during the French Revolution. In August 1807 Smithson became a prisoner of war while in Tönning during the Napoleonic Wars. He arranged a transfer to Hamburg, where he was again imprisoned, now by the French. The following year, Smithson wrote to Sir Joseph Banks and asked him to use his influence to gain release; Banks succeeded and Smithson returned to England. He never married or had children.

In 1766, his mother had inherited from the Hungerford family of Studley, where her brother had lived up until his death. His controversial legal step-father John Marshe Dickinson (aka Dickenson) of Dunstable died in 1771. Smithson&#x27;s wealth stemmed from the splitting of his mother&#x27;s estate with his half-brother, Col. Henry Louis Dickenson.

==Scientific work==
Smithson&#x27;s research work was eclectic. He studied subjects ranging from coffee making to the use of calamine, eventually renamed smithsonite, in making brass. He also studied the chemistry of human tears, snake venom and other natural occurrences. Smithson would publish twenty-seven papers. He was nominated to the Royal Society of London by Henry Cavendish and was made a fellow on 26 April 1787. Smithson socialised and worked with scientists Joseph Priestley, Sir Joseph Banks, Antoine Lavoisier, and Richard Kirwan.

His first paper was presented at the Royal Society on 7 July 1791, &quot;An Account of Some Chemical Experiments on Tabasheer&quot;. Tabasheer is a substance used in traditional Indian medicine and derived from material collected inside bamboo culms. The samples that Macie analysed had been sent by Patrick Russell, physician-naturalist in India.

In 1802 he read his second paper, &quot;A Chemical Analysis of Some Calamines,&quot; at the Royal Society. It was published in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London&quot; and was the documented instance of his new name, James Smithson. In the paper, Smithson challenges the idea that the mineral calamine is an oxide of zinc. His discoveries made calamine a &quot;true mineral&quot;.

He explored and examined Kirkdale Cave; his findings, published in 1824, successfully challenged previous beliefs that the fossils within the formations at the cave were from the Great Flood.

Smithson is credited with first using the word &quot;silicates&quot;; Smithson&#x27;s bank records at C. Hoare &amp; Co show extensive and regular income derived from Apsley Pellatt, which suggests that Smithson had a strong financial or scientific relationship with the Blackfriars glass maker.

==Later life and death==
Smithson died in Genoa, Italy on 27 June 1829. He was buried in a Protestant cemetery overlooking Sampierdarena. In his will written in 1826, Smithson left his fortune to the son of his brother – that is, his nephew, Henry James Dickenson. Dickenson had to change his surname to Hungerford as a condition of receiving the inheritance. In the will Smithson stated that Henry James Hungerford, or Hungerford&#x27;s children, would receive his inheritance, and that if his nephew did not live, and had no children to receive the fortune, it would be donated to the United States to establish an educational institution to be called the Smithsonian Institution.

Henry Hungerford died on 5 June 1835, unmarried and leaving behind no children, and the United States was the recipient. In his will, Smithson explained the Smithsonian mission:

I then bequeath the whole of my property, . . . to the United States of America, to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an Establishment for the increase &amp; diffusion of knowledge among men.

==Legacy and the Smithsonian==
Later in the year of his death the United States government was informed about the bequest when Aaron Vail wrote to Secretary of State John Forsyth. This information was then passed onto President Andrew Jackson who then informed Congress; a committee was organized, and after much debate the Smithsonian Institution was established by legislation. In 1836 President Jackson sent Richard Rush, former Treasury Secretary, to England as Commissioner to proceed in Chancery Court to secure the funds. In 1838 he was successful and returned, accompanied by 104,960 gold sovereigns (in eleven crates) and Smithson&#x27;s personal items, scientific notes, minerals, and library. The gold was transferred to the treasury in Philadelphia and was reminted into $508,318.46. The final funds from Smithson were received in 1864 from Marie de la Batut, Smithson&#x27;s nephew&#x27;s mother. This final amount totalled $54,165.38.

On 24 February 1847 the Board of Regents, which oversaw the creation of the Smithsonian, approved the seal for the institution. The seal, based on an engraving by Pierre Joseph Tiolier, was manufactured by Edward Stabler and designed by Robert Dale Owen. Although Smithson&#x27;s papers and collection of minerals were destroyed in a fire in 1865, his collection of 213 books remains intact at the Smithsonian. The Board of Regents acquired a portrait of Smithson dressed in Oxford University student attire, painted by James Roberts, that is now on display in the crypt at the Smithsonian Castle. An additional portrait, a miniature, and the original draft of Smithson&#x27;s will were acquired in 1877; they now reside in the National Portrait Gallery and Smithsonian Institution Archives, respectively. Additional items were acquired from Smithson&#x27;s relatives in 1878.

The circumstances of his birth seem to have created in him a desire for posthumous fame, although he had established quite a reputation in the scientific community and lived proud of his descent. Smithson once wrote:
The best blood of England flows in my veins. On my father&#x27;s side I am a Northumberland, on my mother&#x27;s I am related to kings; but this avails me not. My name shall live in the memory of man when the titles of the Northumberlands and the Percys are extinct and forgotten.

===Relocation of Smithson&#x27;s remains to Washington===

Smithson was buried in Sampierdarena, Genoa, Italy. The United States consul in Genoa was asked to maintain the grave site, with sponsorship for its maintenance coming from the Smithsonian Institution. Smithsonian Secretary Samuel P. Langley visited the site, contributing further money to maintain it and requested a plaque be designed for the grave site. Three plaques were created by William Ordway Partridge. One was placed at the grave site, a second at a Protestant chapel in Genoa, and the last was gifted to Pembroke College, Oxford. Only one of the plaques exists today. The plaque at the grave site was stolen and then replaced with a marble version. During World War II, the Protestant chapel was destroyed and the plaque was looted. A copy was eventually placed at the site in 1963.

The cemetery where Smithson rested was going to be moved in 1905, for the expansion of an adjacent quarry. In response, Alexander Graham Bell, then a regent of the Smithsonian, proposed that Smithson&#x27;s remains be moved to the Smithsonian Institution Building; in 1903, he and his wife, Mabel Gardiner Hubbard, traveled to Genoa to exhume the body. A steamship departed Genoa on 7 January 1904 with the remains and arrived in Hoboken, New Jersey on 20 January, where they were transferred to the for the trip to Washington.

On 25 January a ceremony was held in Washington, D.C., and the body was escorted by the United States Cavalry to the Castle. When handing over the remains to the Smithsonian, Bell stated: &quot;And now... my mission is ended and I deliver into your hands ... the remains of this great benefactor of the United States.” The coffin then lay in state in the Board of Regents&#x27; room, where objects from Smithson&#x27;s personal collection were on display.

===Memorial===

After the arrival of Smithson&#x27;s remains, the Board of Regents asked Congress to fund a memorial. Artists and architects were solicited to create proposals for the monument. Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Louis Saint-Gaudens, Gutzon Borglum, Totten &amp; Rogers, Henry Bacon, and Hornblower &amp; Marshall were some of the many artists and architectural firms who submitted proposals. The proposals varied in design, from elaborate monumental tombs that, if built, would have been bigger than the Lincoln Memorial, to smaller monuments just outside the Smithsonian Castle. Congress decided not to fund the memorial. To accommodate the fact that the Smithsonian would have to fund the memorial, they used the design of Gutzon Borglum, which suggested a remodel of the south tower room of the Smithsonian Castle to house the memorial surrounded by four Corinthian columns and a vaulted ceiling. Instead of the tower room, a smaller room (at the time it was the janitor&#x27;s closet) at the north entrance would house an Italian-style sarcophagus.

On 8 December 1904 the Italian crypt was shipped, in sixteen crates from Italy. It travelled on the same ship that the remains of Smithson travelled on. Architecture firm Hornblower &amp; Marshall designed the mortuary chapel, which included marble laurel wreaths and a neo-classical design. Smithson was entombed on 6 March 1905. His casket, which had been held in the Regent&#x27;s Room, was placed into the ground underneath the crypt. This chapel was to serve as a temporary space for Smithson&#x27;s remains until Congress approved a larger memorial. However, that never happened, and the remains of Smithson still lie there today.

Originally established in 1851 as Wahkaw County, the Iowa Legislature in 1853 changed the name to Woodbury County in honor of Levi Woodbury (1789–1851), a senator and governor of New Hampshire who served as a Supreme Court justice from 1844 until his death.

The first county seat of Wahkaw County was the now-extinct village of Thompsonville; when the Legislature changed the county name to Woodbury, the new county seat became Sergeant&#x27;s Bluff (now Sergeant Bluff). The county seat was moved to Sioux City in 1856.

The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska (Ho-Chunk) owns reservation land in Woodbury County.

== History ==
&quot;When the first white settlers came into the county, and for some years thereafter, roving bands of Winnebago Indians made their temporary home within the limits of the county. At times there would be as many as one hundred living along the Lime Creek valley or about Coon Grove, and at other times there would be but a mere handful ... During the summer seasons they would cache their cooking utensils, leave their tepees standing and go northward into Minnesota to hunt and trap. At that time the Winnebago agency was located about forty miles north of Forest City.&quot; The Winnebago were removed after the Dakota War of 1862.

Initial settlement was in the wooded eastern third of the county, with prairie and marshy areas in the west being settled after 1880. Early teachers in Winnebago County were required to be able to converse in the language of their pupils. Many of the county&#x27;s pioneers were of Norwegian descent.

The oldest standing structure in the county is Trinity Church, built in 1874.

In 1938, the Winnebago Rural Electric Cooperative was established. The first section of lines was energized on January 3, 1940.

A 1951 movie by the Rural Electrification Administration featured local residents describing the struggles for adequate phone service in Winnebago County, prior to the federal loan which enabled the Winnebago Cooperative Telephone Association to convert the area to modern dial service.

The Winnebago Industries RV manufacturing company was founded in Forest City in 1958.

The Winnebago Historical Society is located in the Mansion Museum in Forest City.

<text>Wayne County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,497, making it the sixth-least populous county in Iowa. The county seat is Corydon.

==History==
Wayne County was formed in 1846 but was still attached to other counties for governmental purposes. It was named after General Anthony Wayne.

Its southern border with Missouri was uncertain until the states got a decision from the US Supreme Court in 1848 which held the 1816 Sullivan line (re-marked in 1850), originally run as the northern boundary of an Osage Indian cession. This line is not a true east–west line so the county does not have an exactly rectangular shape.

There had been settlement in this county as early as 1841 by persons thinking they were in Missouri, but the first settlers intending to be in Iowa came about 1848. Its government was organized and the county seat selected in 1851.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.

<text>Washington County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 22,565. The county seat is Washington. Washington County is included in the Iowa City Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Washington County was originally formed in 1838 as Slaughter County in honor of William B. Slaughter, the secretary of Wisconsin Territory. The county, still named Slaughter County, became part of Iowa Territory on July 4, 1838, when it was organized. To honor George Washington, the county opted to change its name on January 25, 1839. The first White American colonizers arrived in Washington County in 1835, and began establishing individual domiciles in 1836. A settlement, Astoria, was built in the present township of Oregon; it became the first county seat and housed the first court house. The county seat was moved to the city of Washington in 1839.

The first religious society, organized by Reverend J.L. Kirkpatrick, a Methodist minister was created in 1839. The first newspaper was established in 1853; it was published for two years. In 1856 another newspaper started up; it has continued to the present. The major waterways through Washington County are the Skunk and English Rivers, and Crooked Creek. Timber is found in abundance around these waterways, which has allowed a timber industry to grow up. In 1855 Washington hosted the county&#x27;s first bank. The county population swelled after 1858, when a railway line belonging to the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad was laid there.

<doc id="95910" wikidata="Q37600" url="?curid=95910" title="Bichon Frisé">
<text>The Bichon Frisé or Bichon à Poil Frisé is a Franco-Belgian breed of small toy dog of bichon type. It was recognised by the Société Centrale Canine in 1933 and by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1959. 

==Etymology==

The French word comes from Middle French (&#x27;small dog&#x27;), a diminutive of Old French (&#x27;female dog&#x27;, cognate with English &quot;bitch&quot;), from Old English , and related to other Germanic words with the same meaning, including Old Norse , and German . Some speculate the origin of to be the result of the apheresis, or shortening, of the word (&#x27;small poodle&#x27;), a derivative of (&#x27;shaggy dog&#x27;); however, this is likely impossible, since the word (attested 1588) is older than (attested 1694). While the English name for the breed, &quot;Bichon Frise&quot;, is derived from the French meaning &#x27;curly haired small dog&#x27;.

==History==
The dogs found early success in Spain and it is generally believed that Spanish seamen introduced the early breed to Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Their association with European nobility began in the 13th century, entering the royal courts of Spain, Italy and France. In the 14th century, Italian sailors rediscovered the dogs on their voyages and are credited with returning them to continental Europe.

The Bichon à Poil Frisé was recognised by the Société Centrale Canine in 1933. It was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in October 1959.

Some of the dogs were brought to the United States in 1955 and to the United Kingdom in 1973.

== Appearance ==

The Bichon Frisé is a small dog, standing at the withers and weighing approximately , the weight varying in proportion to the height. The skull is rather flat, but may appear rounded; the muzzle tapers only slightly, and constitutes two-fifths of the length of the head. The nose is black, the eyes dark and round.

The coat is loosely curled in spirals or corkscrews, with a thick soft undercoat. It is always pure white; only in dogs under a year old may it be slightly tinged with beige, this extending over no more than 10% of the area of the body. The head and legs are proportionate in size to the body.

==Health==

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.5 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

An American study looking at immune-mediated hemolytic anemia found a predisposition to the condition in the Bichon Frise, with 9% of cases belonging to the breed despite being 2% of the control population.

A study in the UK found the Bichon Frise to be predisposed to gall bladder disease (excluding gall bladder mucocele). The Bichon Frise was found to be 9.26 times more likely to acquire a non-mucocele gall bladder disease than other dogs.

<text>Oligoclonal bands (OCBs) are bands of immunoglobulins that are seen when a patient&#x27;s blood serum, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is analyzed. They are used in the diagnosis of various neurological and blood diseases. Oligoclonal bands are present in the CSF of more than 95% of patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis.

Two methods of analysis are possible: (a) protein electrophoresis, a method of analyzing the composition of fluids, also known as &quot;SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis)/Coomassie blue staining&quot;, and (b) the combination of isoelectric focusing/silver staining. The latter is more sensitive.

For the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, a sample is first collected via lumbar puncture (LP). Normally it is assumed that all the proteins that appear in the CSF, but are not present in the serum, are produced intrathecally (inside the central nervous system). Therefore, it is normal to subtract bands in serum from bands in CSF when investigating CNS diseases. A sample of blood serum is usually obtained from a clotted blood sample taken around the time of the LP.

==Oligoclonal bands in multiple sclerosis==

OCBs are especially important for multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, normally only OCBs made of immunoglobulin G antibodies are considered, though sometimes other proteins can be taken into account, like lipid-specific immunoglobulin M. The presence of these IgM OCBs is associated with a more severe course.

Typically for an OCB analysis, the CSF is concentrated and the serum is diluted. After this dilution/concentration prealbumin appears as higher on CSF. Albumin is typically the dominant band on both fluids. Transferrin is another prominent protein on CSF column because its small molecular size easily increases its filtration in to CSF. CSF has a relatively higher concentration of prealbumin than does serum. As expected large molecular proteins are absent in CSF column. After all these bands are localized, OCBs should be assessed in the γ region which normally hosts small group of polyclonal immunoglobulins.

New techniques like &quot;capillary isoelectric focusing immunoassay&quot; are able to detect IgG OCBs in more than 95% of multiple sclerosis patients.

Even more than 12 OCBs can appear in MS. Each one of them represent antibody proteins (or protein fragments) secreted by plasma cells, although why exactly these bands are present, and which proteins these bands represent, has not yet been fully elucidated. The target antigens for these antibodies are not easy to find because it requires to isolate a single kind of protein in each band, though new techniques are able to do so.

In 40% of MS patients with OCBs, antibodies specific to the viruses HHV-6 and EBV have been found.

HHV-6 specific OCBs have also been found in other demyelinating diseases. A lytic protein of HHV-6A virus was identified as the target of HHV-6 specific oligoclonal bands.

Though early theories assumed that the OCBs were somehow pathogenic autoantigens, recent research has shown that the IgG present in the OCBs are antibodies against debris, and therefore, OCBs seem to be just a secondary effect of MS. Nevertheless, OCBs remain useful as a biomarker.

===Diagnostic value in MS===

Oligoclonal bands are an important indicator in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Up to 95% of all patients with multiple sclerosis have permanently observable oligoclonal bands at least for those with European ancestry. The last available reports in 2017 were pointing to a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 87% for differential diagnosis versus MS mimickers (specificity respect unselected population should be equal or higher).

Other application for OCBs is as a tool to classify patients. It is known since long ago that OCB negative MS patients have a slower evolution. Some reports point that the underlying condition that causes the MS lesions in these patients is different. There are four pathological patterns of damage, and in the majority of patients with pattern II and III brain lesions oligoclonal bands are absent or only transiently present.

===Heterogeneity===

It has been reported that oligoclonal bands are nearly absent in patients with pattern II and pattern III lesion types.

Six groups of patients are usually separated, based on OCBs:

*type 1, no bands in CSF and serum; 
*type 2, oligoclonal IgG bands in CSF, 
*type 3, oligoclonal bands in CSF and serum with additional bands in CSF; 
*type 4, identical oligoclonal bands in CSF and serum, 
*type 5, monoclonal bands in CSF and serum, 
*type 6, presence of a single band limited to the CSF.

Type 2 and 3 indicate intrathecal synthesis, and the rest are considered as negative results (No MS).

===Alternatives===

The main importance of oligoclonal bands was to demonstrate the production of intrathecal immunoglobins (IgGs) for establishing a MS diagnosis. Currently alternative methods for detection of this intrathecal synthesis have been published, and therefore it has lost some of its importance in this area.

A specially interesting method are free light chains (FLC), specially the kappa-FLCs (kFLCs). Several authors have reported that the nephelometric and ELISA FLCs determination is comparable with OCBs as markers of IgG synthesis, and kFLCs behave even better than oligoclonal bands.

Another alternative to oligoclonal bands for MS diagnosis is the MRZ-reaction (MRZR), a polyspecific antiviral immune response against the viruses of measles, rubella and zoster found in 1992.

In some reports the MRZR showed a lower sensitivity than OCB (70% vs. 100%), but a higher specificity (92% vs. 69%) for MS.

==Bands in other diseases==

The presence of one band (a monoclonal band) may be considered serious, such as lymphoproliferative disease, or may simply be normal—it must be interpreted in the context of each specific patient. More bands may reflect the presence of a disease.

===Diseases associated===
