<text>Eric Frank Russell (January 6, 1905 – February 28, 1978) was a British writer best known for his science fiction novels and short stories. Much of his work was first published in the United States, in John W. Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and other pulp magazines. Russell also wrote horror fiction for &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and non-fiction articles on Fortean topics. Up to 1955 several of his stories were published under pseudonyms, at least Duncan H. Munro and Niall(e) Wilde.

== Biography ==
Russell was born in 1905 near Sandhurst in Berkshire, where his father was an instructor at the Royal Military College. Russell became a fan of science fiction and in 1934, while living near Liverpool, he saw a letter in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; from Leslie J. Johnson, another reader from the same area. Russell met with Johnson, who encouraged him to embark on a writing career. Together, the two men wrote a novella, &quot;Seeker of Tomorrow&quot;, that was published by F. Orlin Tremaine in the July 1937 number of &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;. Both Russell and Johnson became members of the British Interplanetary Society.

Russell&#x27;s first novel was &quot;Sinister Barrier&quot;, cover story for the inaugural, May 1939 issue of &quot;Unknown&quot;—&quot;Astounding&quot;s sister magazine devoted to fantasy. It is explicitly a Fortean tale, based on Charles Fort&#x27;s famous speculation &quot;I think we&#x27;re property&quot;, Russell explains in the foreword. An often-repeated legend has it that Campbell, on receiving the manuscript for &quot;Sinister Barrier&quot;, created &quot;Unknown&quot; primarily as a vehicle for the short novel (pp. 9–94). There is no real evidence for this, despite a statement to that effect in the first volume of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;In Memory Yet Green&quot;.

His second novel, &quot;Dreadful Sanctuary&quot; (serialized in &quot;Astounding&quot; during 1948) is an early example of conspiracy fiction, in which a paranoid delusion of global proportions is perpetuated by a small but powerful secret society.

There are two incompatible accounts of Russell&#x27;s military service during World War II. The official, well-documented version is that he served with the Royal Air Force, with whom he saw active service in Europe as a member of a Mobile Signals Unit. However, in the introduction to the 1986 Del Rey Books edition of Russell&#x27;s novel &quot;Wasp&quot;, Jack L. Chalker states that Russell was too old for active service, and instead worked for Military Intelligence in London, where he &quot;spent the war dreaming up nasty tricks to play against the Germans and Japanese&quot;, including Operation Mincemeat. Russell&#x27;s biographer John L. Ingham states however that &quot;there is nothing, absolutely nothing, in his R.A.F. record to show that he was anything more than a wireless mechanic and radio operator&quot;.

Russell took up writing full-time in the late 1940s. He became an active member of British science fiction fandom and the British representative of the Fortean Society. He won the first annual Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1955 recognizing his humorous &quot;Allamagoosa&quot; as the year&#x27;s best science fiction.

The 1962 novel &quot;The Great Explosion&quot; won a Prometheus Hall of Fame Award in 1985—the third naming of two works to the libertarian science fiction hall of fame. The 1957 novel &quot;Wasp&quot; has been a finalist for the honor, which is now limited to one work per year.

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Russell in 2000, its fifth class of two deceased and two living writers.

&quot;Into Your Tent&quot;, a thorough and detailed biography of Russell by John L. Ingham, was published in 2010 by Plantech (UK).

==Writings==
Russell&#x27;s full-length fiction includes the following:
* &quot;Sinister Barrier&quot; (1939)
* &quot;Dreadful Sanctuary&quot; (1948)
* &quot;Sentinels From Space&quot; (1953), based on the earlier magazine story &quot;The Star Watchers&quot; (1951)
* &quot;Three to Conquer&quot; (1956), based on the earlier magazine serial &quot;Call Him Dead&quot; (1955)
* &quot;Men, Martians and Machines&quot; (1955), containing four related novellas
* &quot;Wasp&quot; (1958)
* &quot;Next of Kin&quot; (1959), published earlier as &quot;The Space Willies&quot; (1958)
* &quot;The Great Explosion&quot; (1962)
* &quot;With a Strange Device&quot; (1964), also published as &quot;The Mindwarpers&quot;.

Russell also wrote a large number of shorter works, many of which have been reprinted in collections such as &quot;Deep Space&quot; (1954), &quot;Six Worlds Yonder&quot; (1958), &quot;Far Stars&quot; (1961), &quot;Dark Tides&quot; (1962) and &quot;Somewhere a Voice&quot; (1965). His short story &quot;Allamagoosa&quot; (1955) won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story.

Russell wrote numerous non-fiction essays on Fortean themes, some of which were collected in a compendium of Forteana entitled &quot;Great World Mysteries&quot; (1957). His second non-fiction book was &quot;The Rabble Rousers&quot; (1963), a sardonic look at human folly including the Dreyfus affair and the Florida land boom. He also wrote &quot;Lern Yerself Scouse: The ABZ of Scouse&quot; (1966) under the pseudonym &quot;Linacre Lane&quot;.

Two omnibus collections of Russell&#x27;s science fiction are available from NESFA Press: &quot;Major Ingredients&quot; (2000), containing 30 of his short stories, and &quot;Entities&quot; (2001) containing five novels. John Pelan&#x27;s Midnight House published &quot;Dark Tides&quot;, a collection of Russell&#x27;s horror and weird fiction, in 2006.

The 1995 novel &quot;Design for Great-Day&quot;, published as by Alan Dean Foster and Eric Frank Russell, is an expansion by Foster of a 1953 short story of the same name by Russell.

==Writing style and themes==
Russell had an easy-going, colloquial writing style that was influenced in part by American &quot;hard-boiled&quot; detective fiction of the kind popularized by &quot;Black Mask&quot; magazine. Although British, Russell wrote predominantly for an American audience, and was often assumed to be American by readers.

Much of Russell&#x27;s science fiction is based on what might be described as Fortean themes, with &quot;Sinister Barrier&quot; and &quot;Dreadful Sanctuary&quot; the most notable examples. Another common theme is the single resourceful human pitted against a ponderous alien bureaucracy, as in the novels &quot;Wasp&quot; and &quot;Next of Kin&quot;, as well as several shorter works.

Russell is sometimes categorized as a humorous writer, and Brian Aldiss describes him as John W. Campbell&#x27;s &quot;licensed jester&quot;. However, Russell&#x27;s humour generally has a satirical edge, often aimed at authority and bureaucracy in its various forms. On other occasions, for example in the short stories &quot;Somewhere a Voice&quot; and &quot;The Army Comes to Venus&quot;, his work has a deeper and more serious tone, in which the spiritual aspects of humanity&#x27;s endeavours and aspirations shine through.

==Critical reception==
Scott Connors, reviewing Russell&#x27;s book &quot;Darker Tides&quot;, stated that &quot;Russell&#x27;s prose displays a rare sense of irony and wit...and does the reader the compliment of presenting the story in an indirect fashion so that he has an investment in the tale.&quot; Carl Sagan wrote that Russell&#x27;s stories were examples of &quot;desperately need[ed] exploration of alternative futures, both experimental and conceptual&quot;.

==Cultural influences==

Russell&#x27;s short story &quot;Jay Score&quot; (1941) is unusual amongst the pulp fiction of its time in presenting a black character, the ship&#x27;s doctor, without any racial stereotyping. Indeed, this story and its sequels (collected in &quot;Men, Martians and Machines&quot;) may be considered an early example of the science fiction subgenre in which a spaceship is crewed by a multi-ethnic, mixed human/non-human, complement (cf. the much later &quot;Star Trek&quot;).

In 1970, Russell was paid £4689 by the Beatles&#x27; company Apple Corps for the motion picture rights to his novel &quot;Wasp&quot;, the contract being signed on behalf of Apple by Ringo Starr. The film was never made, but it remained one of the most lucrative deals Russell ever made.

<doc id="105658" wikidata="Q55506489" url="?curid=105658" title="Pyrophosphate">
<text>In chemistry, pyrophosphates are phosphorus oxyanions that contain two phosphorus atoms in a linkage. A number of pyrophosphate salts exist, such as disodium pyrophosphate () and tetrasodium pyrophosphate (), among others. Often pyrophosphates are called diphosphates. The parent pyrophosphates are derived from partial or complete neutralization of pyrophosphoric acid. The pyrophosphate bond is also sometimes referred to as a phosphoanhydride bond, a naming convention which emphasizes the loss of water that occurs when two phosphates form a new bond, and which mirrors the nomenclature for anhydrides of carboxylic acids. Pyrophosphates are found in ATP and other nucleotide triphosphates, which are important in biochemistry. The term pyrophosphate is also the name of esters formed by the condensation of a phosphorylated biological compound with inorganic phosphate, as for dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. This bond is also referred to as a high-energy phosphate bond.

==Acidity==
Pyrophosphoric acid is a tetraprotic acid, with four distinct p&quot;K&quot;a&#x27;s:
:, p&quot;K&quot;a1 = 0.85
:, p&quot;K&quot;a2 = 1.96 
:, p&quot;K&quot;a3 = 6.60
:, p&quot;K&quot;a4 = 9.41 
The pKa&#x27;s occur in two distinct ranges because deprotonations occur on separate phosphate groups. For comparison with the p&quot;K&quot;a&#x27;s for phosphoric acid are 2.14, 7.20, and 12.37.

At physiological pH&#x27;s, pyrophosphate exists as a mixture of doubly and singly protonated forms.

==Preparation==
Disodium pyrophosphate is prepared by thermal condensation of sodium dihydrogen phosphate or by partial deprotonation of pyrophosphoric acid.

Pyrophosphates are generally white or colorless. The alkali metal salts are water-soluble. They are good complexing agents for metal ions (such as calcium and many transition metals) and have many uses in industrial chemistry. Pyrophosphate is the first member of an entire series of polyphosphates.

== In biochemistry ==
The anion is abbreviated PPi, standing for &quot;inorganic pyrophosphate&quot;. It is formed by the hydrolysis of ATP into AMP in cells.
:ATP → AMP + PPi

For example, when a nucleotide is incorporated into a growing DNA or RNA strand by a polymerase, pyrophosphate (PPi) is released. Pyrophosphorolysis is the reverse of the polymerization reaction in which pyrophosphate reacts with the 3′-nucleosidemonophosphate (NMP or dNMP), which is removed from the oligonucleotide to release the corresponding triphosphate (dNTP from DNA, or NTP from RNA).

The pyrophosphate anion has the structure , and is an acid anhydride of phosphate. It is unstable in aqueous solution and hydrolyzes into inorganic phosphate:
or in biologists&#x27; shorthand notation:

In the absence of enzymic catalysis, hydrolysis reactions of simple polyphosphates such as pyrophosphate, linear triphosphate, ADP, and ATP normally proceed extremely slowly in all but highly acidic media.

(The reverse of this reaction is a method of preparing pyrophosphates by heating phosphates.)

This hydrolysis to inorganic phosphate effectively renders the cleavage of ATP to AMP and PPi irreversible, and biochemical reactions coupled to this hydrolysis are irreversible as well.

PPi occurs in synovial fluid, blood plasma, and urine at levels sufficient to block calcification and may be a natural inhibitor of hydroxyapatite formation in extracellular fluid (ECF). Cells may channel intracellular PPi into ECF. ANK is a nonenzymatic plasma-membrane PPi channel that supports extracellular PPi levels. Defective function of the membrane PPi channel ANK is associated with low extracellular PPi and elevated intracellular PPi. Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (ENPP) may function to raise extracellular PPi.

From the standpoint of high energy phosphate accounting, the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and PPi requires two high-energy phosphates, as to reconstitute AMP into ATP requires two phosphorylation reactions.
:AMP + ATP → 2 ADP
:2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 ATP

The plasma concentration of inorganic pyrophosphate has a reference range of 0.58–3.78 μM (95% prediction interval).

===Terpenes===
Isopentenyl pyrophosphate converts to geranyl pyrophosphate, the precursor to tens of thousands of terpeness and terpenoids. 
==As a food additive==

Various diphosphates are used as emulsifiers, stabilisers, acidity regulators, raising agents, sequestrants, and water retention agents in food processing. They are classified in the E number scheme under E450:

*E450(a): &quot;di&quot;sodium dihydrogen diphosphate; &quot;tri&quot;sodium diphosphate; &quot;tetra&quot;sodium diphosphate (TSPP); tetrapotassium diphosphate
*E450(b): &quot;penta&quot;sodium and &quot;penta&quot;potassium triphosphate
*E450(c): sodium and potassium polyphosphates

In particular, various formulations of diphosphates are used to stabilize whipped cream.

<text>Upwelling is an oceanographic phenomenon that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water from deep water towards the ocean surface. It replaces the warmer and usually nutrient-depleted surface water. The nutrient-rich upwelled water stimulates the growth and reproduction of primary producers such as phytoplankton. The biomass of phytoplankton and the presence of cool water in those regions allow upwelling zones to be identified by cool sea surface temperatures (SST) and high concentrations of chlorophyll a.

The increased availability of nutrients in upwelling regions results in high levels of primary production and thus fishery production. Approximately 25% of the total global marine fish catches come from five upwellings, which occupy only 5% of the total ocean area. Upwellings that are driven by coastal currents or diverging open ocean have the greatest impact on nutrient-enriched waters and global fishery yields.

==Mechanisms==
The three main drivers that work together to cause upwelling are wind, Coriolis effect, and Ekman transport. They operate differently for different types of upwelling, but the general effects are the same. In the overall process of upwelling, winds blow across the sea surface at a particular direction, which causes a wind-water interaction. As a result of the wind, the water has transported a net of 90 degrees from the direction of the wind due to Coriolis forces and Ekman transport. Ekman transport causes the surface layer of water to move at about a 45-degree angle from the direction of the wind, and the friction between that layer and the layer beneath it causes the successive layers to move in the same direction. This results in a spiral of water moving down the water column. Then, it is the Coriolis forces that dictate which way the water will move; in the Northern hemisphere, the water is transported to the right of the direction of the wind. In the Southern Hemisphere, the water is transported to the left of the wind. If this net movement of water is divergent, then upwelling of deep water occurs to replace the water that was lost.

==Types==
The major upwellings in the ocean are associated with the divergence of currents that bring deeper, colder, nutrient rich waters to the surface. There are at least five types of upwelling: coastal upwelling, large-scale wind-driven upwelling in the ocean interior, upwelling associated with eddies, topographically-associated upwelling, and broad-diffusive upwelling in the ocean interior.

=== Coastal ===
Coastal upwelling is the best known type of upwelling, and the most closely related to human activities as it supports some of the most productive fisheries in the world. Coastal upwelling will occur if the wind direction is parallel to the coastline and generates wind-driven currents. The wind-driven currents are diverted to the right of the winds in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere due to the Coriolis effect. The result is a net movement of surface water at right angles to the direction of the wind, known as the Ekman transport (See also Ekman Spiral). When Ekman transport is occurring away from the coast, surface waters moving away are replaced by deeper, colder, and denser water. Normally, this upwelling process occurs at a rate of about 5–10 meters per day, but the rate and proximity of upwelling to the coast can be changed due to the strength and distance of the wind.

Deep waters are rich in nutrients, including nitrate, phosphate and silicic acid, themselves the result of decomposition of sinking organic matter (dead/detrital plankton) from surface waters. When brought to the surface, these nutrients are utilized by phytoplankton, along with dissolved CO2 (carbon dioxide) and light energy from the sun, to produce organic compounds, through the process of photosynthesis. Upwelling regions therefore result in very high levels of primary production (the amount of carbon fixed by phytoplankton) in comparison to other areas of the ocean. They account for about 50% of global marine productivity. High primary production propagates up the food chain because phytoplankton are at the base of the oceanic food chain.

The food chain follows the course of:

* Phytoplankton → Zooplankton → Predatory zooplankton → Filter feeders → Predatory fish → Marine birds, marine mammals

Coastal upwelling exists year-round in some regions, known as &quot;major coastal upwelling systems&quot;, and only in certain months of the year in other regions, known as &quot;seasonal coastal upwelling systems&quot;. Many of these upwelling systems are associated with relatively high carbon productivity and hence are classified as Large Marine Ecosystems.

Worldwide, there are five major coastal currents associated with upwelling areas: the Canary Current (off Northwest Africa), the Benguela Current (off southern Africa), the California Current (off California and Oregon), the Humboldt Current (off Peru and Chile), and the Somali Current (off Somalia and Oman). All of these currents support major fisheries. The four major eastern boundary currents in which coastal upwelling primarily occurs are the Canary Current, Benguela Current, California Current, and Humboldt Current. The Benguela Current is the eastern boundary of the South Atlantic subtropical gyre and can be divided into a northern and southern sub-system with upwelling occurring in both areas. The subsystems are divided by an area of permanent upwelling off of Luderitz, which is the strongest upwelling zone in the world. The California Current System (CCS) is an eastern boundary current of the North Pacific that is also characterized by a north and south split. The split in this system occurs at Point Conception, California due to weak upwelling in the South and strong upwelling in the north. The Canary Current is an eastern boundary current of the North Atlantic Gyre and is also separated due to the presence of the Canary Islands. Finally, the Humboldt Current or the Peru Current flows west along the coast of South America from Peru to Chile and extends up to 1,000 kilometers offshore. These four eastern boundary currents comprise the majority of coastal upwelling zones in the oceans.

==== Equatorial ====
Upwelling at the equator is associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which actually moves, and consequently, is often located just north or south of the equator. Easterly (westward) trade winds blow from the Northeast and Southeast and converge along the equator blowing West to form the ITCZ. Although there are no Coriolis forces present along the equator, upwelling still occurs just north and south of the equator. This results in a divergence, with denser, nutrient-rich water being upwelled from below, and results in the remarkable fact that the equatorial region in the Pacific can be detected from space as a broad line of high phytoplankton concentration.

==== Southern Ocean ====

Large-scale upwelling is also found in the Southern Ocean. Here, strong westerly (eastward) winds blow around Antarctica, driving a significant flow of water northwards. This is actually a type of coastal upwelling. Since there are no continents in a band of open latitudes between South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, some of this water is drawn up from great depths. In many numerical models and observational syntheses, the Southern Ocean upwelling represents the primary means by which deep dense water is brought to the surface. In some regions of Antarctica, wind-driven upwelling near the coast pulls relatively warm Circumpolar deep water onto the continental shelf, where it can enhance ice shelf melt and influence ice sheet stability. Shallower, wind-driven upwelling is also found in off the west coasts of North and South America, northwest and southwest Africa, and southwest and south Australia, all associated with oceanic subtropical high pressure circulations (see coastal upwelling above).

Some models of the ocean circulation suggest that broad-scale upwelling occurs in the tropics, as pressure driven flows converge water toward the low latitudes where it is diffusively warmed from above. The required diffusion coefficients, however, appear to be larger than are observed in the real ocean. Nonetheless, some diffusive upwelling does probably occur.

====Other sources====
* Local and intermittent upwellings may occur when offshore islands, ridges, or seamounts cause a deflection of deep currents, providing a nutrient rich area in otherwise low productivity ocean areas. Examples include upwellings around the Galapagos Islands and the Seychelles Islands, which have major pelagic fisheries.
* Upwelling could occur anywhere as long as there is an adequate shear in the horizontal wind field. For example when a tropical cyclone transits an area, usually when moving at speeds of less than 5 mph (8 km/h). The cyclonic winds cause a divergence in the surface water in the Ekman layer, that turn requires upwelling of deeper water to maintain continuity.
* Artificial upwelling is produced by devices that use ocean wave energy or ocean thermal energy conversion to pump water to the surface. Ocean wind turbines are also known to produce upwellings. Ocean wave devices have been shown to produce plankton blooms.

==Variations==
Upwelling intensity depends on wind strength and seasonal variability, as well as the vertical structure of the water, variations in the bottom bathymetry, and instabilities in the currents.

In some areas, upwelling is a seasonal event leading to periodic bursts of productivity similar to spring blooms in coastal waters. Wind-induced upwelling is generated by temperature differences between the warm, light air above the land and the cooler denser air over the sea. In temperate latitudes, the temperature contrast is greatly seasonably variable, creating periods of strong upwelling in the spring and summer, to weak or no upwelling in the winter. For example, off the coast of Oregon, there are four or five strong upwelling events separated by periods of little to no upwelling during the six-month season of upwelling. In contrast, tropical latitudes have a more constant temperature contrast, creating constant upwelling throughout the year. The Peruvian upwelling, for instance, occurs throughout most of the year, resulting in one of the world&#x27;s largest marine fisheries for sardines and anchovies.

In anomalous years when the trade winds weaken or reverse, the water that is upwelled is much warmer and low in nutrients, resulting in a sharp reduction in the biomass and phytoplankton productivity. This event is known as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. The Peruvian upwelling system is particularly vulnerable to ENSO events, and can cause extreme interannual variability in productivity.

Changes in bathymetry can affect the strength of an upwelling. For example, a submarine ridge that extends out from the coast will produce more favorable upwelling conditions than neighboring regions. Upwelling typically begins at such ridges and remains strongest at the ridge even after developing in other locations.

==High productivity==

The most productive and fertile ocean areas, upwelling regions are important sources of marine productivity. They attract hundreds of species throughout the trophic levels; these systems&#x27; diversity has been a focal point for marine research. While studying the trophic levels and patterns typical of upwelling regions, researchers have discovered that upwelling systems exhibit a wasp-waist richness pattern. In this type of pattern, the high and low trophic levels are well-represented by high species diversity. However, the intermediate trophic level is only represented by one or two species. This trophic layer, which consists of small, pelagic fish usually makes up about only three to four percent of the species diversity of all fish species present. The lower trophic layers are very well-represented with about 500 species of copepods, 2500 species of gastropods, and 2500 species of crustaceans on average. At the apex and near-apex trophic levels, there are usually about 100 species of marine mammals and about 50 species of marine birds. The vital intermediate trophic species however are small pelagic fish that usually feed on phytoplankton. In most upwelling systems, these species are either anchovies or sardines, and usually only one is present, although two or three species may be present occasionally. These fish are an important food source for predators, such as large pelagic fish, marine mammals, and marine birds. Although they are not at the base of the trophic pyramid, they are the vital species that connect the entire marine ecosystem and keep the productivity of upwelling zones so high

==Threats to upwelling ecosystems==

A major threat to both this crucial intermediate trophic level and the entire upwelling trophic ecosystem is the problem of commercial fishing. Since upwelling regions are the most productive and species rich areas in the world, they attract a high number of commercial fishers and fisheries. On one hand, this is another benefit of the upwelling process as it serves as a viable source of food and income for so many people and nations besides marine animals. However, just as in any ecosystem, the consequences of over-fishing from a population could be detrimental to that population and the ecosystem as a whole. In upwelling ecosystems, every species present plays a vital role in the functioning of that ecosystem. If one species is significantly depleted, that will have an effect throughout the rest of the trophic levels. For example, if a popular prey species is targeted by fisheries, fishermen may collect hundreds of thousands of individuals of this species just by casting their nets into the upwelling waters. As these fish are depleted, the food source for those who preyed on these fish is depleted. Therefore, the predators of the targeted fish will begin to die off, and there will not be as many of them to feed the predators above them. This system continues throughout the entire food chain, resulting in a possible collapse of the ecosystem. It is possible that the ecosystem may be restored over time, but not all species can recover from events such as these. Even if the species can adapt, there may be a delay in the reconstruction of this upwelling community.

The possibility of such an ecosystem collapse is the very danger of fisheries in upwelling regions. Fisheries may target a variety of different species, and therefore they are a direct threat to many species in the ecosystem, however they pose the highest threat to the intermediate pelagic fish. Since these fish form the crux of the entire trophic process of upwelling ecosystems, they are highly represented throughout the ecosystem (even if there is only one species present). Unfortunately, these fish tend to be the most popular targets of fisheries as about 64 percent of their entire catch consists of pelagic fish. Among those, the six main species that usually form the intermediate trophic layer represent over half of the catch.

Besides directly causing the collapse of the ecosystem due to their absence, this can create problems in the ecosystem through a variety of other methods as well. The animals higher in the trophic levels may not completely starve to death and die off, but the decreased food supply could still hurt the populations. If animals do not get enough food, it will decrease their reproductive viability meaning that they will not breed as often or as successfully as usual. This can lead to a decreasing population, especially in species that do not breed often under normal circumstances or become reproductively mature late in life. Another problem is that the decrease in the population of a species due to fisheries can lead to a decrease in genetic diversity, resulting in a decrease in biodiversity of a species. If the species diversity is decreased significantly, this could cause problems for the species in an environment that is so variable and quick-changing; they may not be able to adapt, which could result in a collapse of the population or ecosystem.

Another threat to the productivity and ecosystems of upwelling regions is El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system, or more specifically El Niño events. During the normal period and La Niña events, the easterly trade winds are still strong, which continues to drive the process of upwelling. However, during El Niño events, trade winds are weaker, causing decreased upwelling in the equatorial regions as the divergence of water north and south of the equator is not as strong or as prevalent. The coastal upwelling zones diminish as well since they are wind driven systems, and the wind is no longer a very strong driving force in these areas. As a result, global upwelling drastically decreases, causing a decrease in productivity as the waters are no longer receiving nutrient-rich water. Without these nutrients, the rest of the trophic pyramid cannot be sustained, and the rich upwelling ecosystem will collapse.

==Effect on climate==
Coastal upwelling has a major influence over the affected region&#x27;s local climate. This effect is magnified if the ocean current is already cool. As the cold, nutrient-rich water moves upwards and the sea surface temperature gets cooler, the air immediately above it also cools down and is likely to condensate, forming sea fog and stratus clouds. This also inhibits the formation of higher altitude clouds, showers and thunderstorms and results in rainfall over the ocean leaving the land dry. In year-round upwelling systems (like that of the western coasts of Southern Africa and South America), temperatures are generally cooler and precipitation scarce. Seasonal upwelling systems are often paired with seasonal downwelling systems (like that of the western coasts of the United States and Iberian Peninsula), resulting in cooler, drier than average summers and milder, wetter than average winters. Permanent upwelling locations typically have semi-arid/desert climates while seasonal upwelling locations usually have Mediterranean/semi-arid climates, oceanic in some cases. Some worldwide cities affected by strong upwelling regimes include: San Francisco, Antofagasta, Sines, Essaouira, Walvis Bay, Curaçao among others.

<text>Rudolph Cornelius Wiedoeft (January 3, 1893 – February 18, 1940) was an American saxophonist whose compositions and solos on recordings helped popularize the instrument.

==Biography==
Born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of German immigrants, at a young age Wiedoeft started playing with his family orchestra, first using a violin, then a clarinet. He relocated to New York City and, after a series of successful clarinet recordings with his Frisco Jass Band, switched to saxophone, then still an unusual instrument. He became known as a virtuoso saxophonist during the 1910s, made more than 300 recordings for many different record companies, and did much to popularize the saxophone as an instrument in both the U.S. and overseas. His main instrument was the C melody saxophone, a variety which was immensely popular from the 1910s until about 1930. He also played and recorded sometimes using E-flat alto and B-flat soprano saxophones as well.

His style was noted for very rapid runs of well-articulated notes in between long legato phrases in a ragtime influenced style. The rapidly articulated notes were made possible by the advanced techniques of double-tonguing and triple-tonguing, similar to those used by brass (trumpet, trombone, etc.) players and flutists. He was also known for his style of vibrato, which was very wide during the later years of his playing. During his earlier years, Wiedoeft&#x27;s use of vibrato was quite spare. Wiedoeft employed several other &#x27;sound effects,&#x27; such as slap tonguing and &quot;laughing&quot; (altering/bending the pitch of the note) through his horn, and alongside his very distinguishable vibrato, became a part of his musical repertoire. While he incorporated some elements of early jazz into his playing, he remained stylistically a pre-jazz artist. Some of his original compositions were successes, notably &quot;Valse Erica&quot;, &quot;Valse Llewellyn&quot;, &quot;Saxema&quot;, &quot;Saxophobia&quot;, and &quot;Sax-o-Phun&quot;.

He remained a very popular entertainer into the 1920s and performed regularly by radio, but his style started to sound more and more dated to the public as his career continued into the 1930s. He worked for a while in Rudy Vallee&#x27;s band, then for a while in France. From the mid-1930s on, he essentially stopped playing and was involved in several mining investments that were not successful.

Rudy and his wife Mary Wiedoeft had a difficult relationship partially due to difficulties of maintaining their rather flamboyant lifestyle and alcohol abuse. During 1937, he was nearly killed when he was stabbed by his wife. The couple reconciled, however, and during the same year, Rudy made his last radio performance.

He died in Flushing, New York, on February 18, 1940, from cirrhosis of the liver.

==Legacy==
Before 1920, the Holton Instrument Company adapted features from existing production model saxophones and marketed them as the &quot;Rudy Wiedoeft Model&quot;. However, it is doubtful Wiedoeft actually performed with such instruments.

Several of Wiedoeft&#x27;s siblings also became professional musicians, the most famous being West coast bandleader Herb Wiedoeft (1886–1928).

<doc id="105669" wikidata="Q5685056" url="?curid=105669" title="Chenega, Alaska">
<text>Chenega (; Alutiiq: ) is a census-designated place (CDP) on Evans Island in the Chugach Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. Located in Prince William Sound, the CDP consists of the Chugach Alutiiq village of Chenega Bay, which was established only after the Good Friday earthquake destroyed the original community on Chenega Island to the north. As of the 2020 census, the population of the CDP was 59, largely Alaska Natives; as of 2021, the population of Chenega is estimated at 49. Chenega Bay is in the Chugach School District and has one school, Chenega Bay Community School, serving approximately 16 students from preschool through high school.

==History==

=== Original Chenega ===
The original village of Chenega, located on Chenega Island, was inhabited by the Chenega tribe, a subgroup of the Chugach Alutiiq. The name Chenega derives from &quot;Beneath the Mountain&quot;. The village was a fishing village that was settled before Russian arrival in the area. A post office operated there from 1946 until the destruction of the town in 1964.

=== Destruction of Chenega ===
The original village of Chenega was destroyed in 1964 by a tsunami from the Good Friday earthquake, which killed 26 residents, a third of the 68 people who lived there at the time, and leveled all the buildings in the town except for the school and a singular house. Immediately following the tsunami, survivors were taken to Cordova, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs later permanently resettled them at Tatitlek.

=== Construction of Chenega Bay ===
After the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was passed, former residents of Chenega formed the Chenega Corporation, which acquired the right to select 76,093 acres of land near the site of the old Chenega Village Township. In 1977, following research into the landscape and the needs of villagers, a new town location was chosen at Crab Bay on Evans Island. Following the acquisition of funding for infrastructure, the new village, named Chenega Bay, was first occupied in 1984.

Former and current Chenega residents gathered each Good Friday to remember the dead of Chenega. On the 25th Good Friday after the earthquake, in 1989, the oil tanker &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; ran aground in Prince William Sound, causing an oil spill that again devastated Chenega and other places around the area economically.

==Geography==
Chenega is located at (60.066327, -148.010991). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (1.17%) is water. The village location is isolated, only accessible by boat or by plane.

It returned in 1900 as Chenega. It did not appear on the 1910 &amp; 1920 censuses. It appeared as &quot;Chanega&quot; in 1930 &amp; 1940 and lastly as Chenega in 1950 and 1960. It was largely destroyed in the Good Friday Earthquake of 1964 and its residents relocated. The old village has not been reported on the census since. Some buildings remain as of 2019.

<text>Chisana (also Shushanna) (Tsetsaan&#x27; Na in Ahtna) is a census-designated place (CDP) in the Copper River Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. As of the 2010 Census, the population of the CDP was 0. The English name Chisana derives from the Ahtna Athabascan name Tsetsaan&#x27; Na, meaning literally &#x27;copper river&#x27; (not to be confused with the river known in English as the Copper River). The Chisana River joins the Nabesna River just north of Northway Junction, Alaska, to form the Tanana River, a major tributary of the Yukon River. The Chisana Airport consists of a turf and gravel runway which is largely serviced by flights from Tok, Alaska.

In 1985, the community was listed as Chisana Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.&lt;br&gt;
In 1998 the Chisana Historic Mining Landscape historic district, comprising the community and a wide area located partly in Copper River Census Area and partly in Southeast Fairbanks Census Area, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which of it is land and of it is water. The total area is 0.10% water.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Chisana has a subarctic climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfc&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Chisana was on June 19–20, 2004, while the coldest temperature recorded was on January 7, 2013.

==Demographics==

Chisana first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated community. It appeared twice more in 1930 and 1940. It would not appear again until 2000, when it was made a census-designated place (CDP). However, in both 2000 and 2010, it reported no residents.

==History==

Athabascans have lived in the area around Chitina for centuries as evidenced by the archaeological sites south and east of Chitina. Before 1900, Chitina was the site of large village whose population was slowly decimated by the influx of people, disease and conflicts.

Copper ore was discovered in about 1900 along the northern edge of the Chitina River valley. This brought a rush of prospectors and homesteaders to the area.

Stephen Birch homesteaded the site in 1908. The Copper River and Northwestern Railway enabled Chitina to develop into a thriving community by 1914. It had a general store, a clothing store, a meat market, stables, a tinsmith, five hotels, several rooming houses, a pool hall, bars, restaurants, dance halls and a movie theater. From 1933 until the closure of the mines in 1938, the general store was managed by Otto Moses of Des Moines, Washington, recruited by O.A. Nelson.

The mines closed in 1938 and the remaining support activities moved to what is now the Glennallen area. Chitina became a virtual ghost town. Otto Adrian Nelson, a surveying engineer for the Kennecott Mines, eventually bought up much of the town. He built a unique hydroelectric system that supplied electric power to all his buildings. He also supplied much of the town center with hot and cold running water.

Current activity in Chitina revolves around the dipnet fishing for salmon that occurs every summer. Alaskans are allowed to dip a large number of salmon during their spawning runs and Chitina is an accessible and popular place for this activity.

In late 1977, jeweler Art Koeninger purchased the Chitina Tin Shop with the intention of turning it into a residence. In 1979, the site, formerly known as Fred&#x27;s Place and Schaupp&#x27;s, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and has won two historic preservation grants. It currently houses the Spirit Mountain Artworks.

<text>Copper Center (&quot;Tl’aticae’e&quot; in Ahtna) is a census-designated place (CDP) on the Copper River in Copper River Census Area, Alaska, United States. By road, it is northeast of Anchorage. At the 2020 census the population was 338, up from 328 in 2000.

==History==
Copper Center developed where the Valdez Glacier trail reached the Copper River. Andrew Holman was its first resident, establishing a temporary roadhouse near the site in July 1898 to provide shelter for prospectors on their way to the Klondike. He initially erected two tents: one served as Hotel Holman and the other as a makeshift post office. By winter 1899, Holman had replaced his tents with a substantial cabin. Leaving Dick Worthman to run the roadhouse, Holman pioneered the first mail route from Valdez to Eagle.

During the height of the Klondike stampede prospectors set up tent camps along both the Copper and Klutina rivers, but the first cabins were built on a site one half mile west of the Copper. Another camp sprang up at what was called Copper Ferry, where a ferry crossed the river. The area got a boost as a goldfield service center in June 1898, when B. F. Millard brushed a trail from there to the mouth of the Slana River via the foothills of Mt. Drum.

The east bank site of Old Copper Center apparently was settled in 1901 1902 by prospectors intent on investigating mineral prospects on that side of the river. Its days as a mining center were short lived, but it did draw a Native population and existed for many years as a village.
Copper Center rapidly became the primary supply center for prospectors and travelers in the Copper River basin. A telegraph station and the trail&#x27;s first official post office opened in 1901, with Ringwald Blix serving as the community&#x27;s first postmaster. The next year, John McCrary staked a homestead about a mile north of the Klutina River crossing. Before long, McCrary opened a hotel as well, the first frame roadhouse between Valdez and Fairbanks. Much of McCrary&#x27;s property remains in the family&#x27;s hands.

By 1910 American settlers had established over fifty homesteads in the vicinity. The community now received tri-weekly mail delivery in the winter and weekly service in the summer. It also contained the only telegraph station between Valdez and Fairbanks where money could be sent or received by wire.

Florence &quot;Ma&quot; Barnes acquired Hotel Holman in 1922, and renamed it the Copper Center Roadhouse and Trading Post. The original building burned in 1932 and was replaced by the southernmost portion of the current one. When Barnes died in 1948, she left her entire estate to a Valdez orphanage. Later that year, it sold George Ashby the property. Although Ashby died in 1979, his family continued to operate the roadhouse. The replacement roadhouse itself burned on May 20, 2012. The family says they intend to rebuild.

==Geography==
Copper Center is located at (61.965305, -145.318280), on the Richardson Highway (Alaska Route 4), on the west bank of the Copper River, at the confluence with the Klutina River. It is about 16 miles southeast of Glennallen, which is on the Glenn Highway (part of Alaska Route 1) just west of Route 4. Copper Center is about 100 miles north of Valdez.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

==Climate==
Copper Center has a dry-summer subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dsc). Proximity to the ocean allows moderated temperatures enough that record lows aren&#x27;t all that extreme, save for December, January, and February. While there is minimal seasonal lag when it comes to averages, it is present with regard to record temperatures. November&#x27;s record low is especially mild.

<doc id="105677" wikidata="Q79607" url="?curid=105677" title="Cordova, Alaska">
<text>Cordova ( ) is a city in Chugach Census Area, Alaska, United States. It lies near the mouth of the Copper River, at the head of Orca Inlet on the east side of Prince William Sound. The population was 2,609 at the 2020 census, up from 2,239 in 2010.

Cordova was named &quot;Puerto Córdoba&quot; by Spanish explorer Salvador Fidalgo in 1790. No roads connect Cordova to other Alaskan communities, so a plane or ferry is required to travel there. In the Exxon Valdez oil spill of March 1989, an oil tanker ran aground northwest of Cordova, heavily damaging ecology and fishing. It was cleaned up shortly after, but there are lingering effects, such as a lowered population of some birds.

==History==

In 1790, the inlet in front of the current Cordova townsite was named Puerto Cordova by Spanish explorer Salvador Fidalgo. The city of Cordova was named after it, although the inlet itself was later renamed the Orca Inlet. Cordova proper was founded as a result of the discovery of high-grade copper ore at Kennecott, north of Cordova. A group of surveyors from Valdez laid out a town site and Michael James Heney purchased half the land for the terminus of the Copper River and Northwestern Railway after determining that the neighboring town of Katalla was a poor harbor. Heney and his crew held a brief ceremony to organize the town on March 26, 1906. A week later, crews arrived to begin work on the railroad. The first lots in the new town site, making up the heart of present-day Cordova, were sold at auction in May 1908. As the railroad grew, so did the town. Eventually schools, businesses, a hospital, and utilities were established. After the railroad was completed, Cordova became the transportation hub for the ore coming out of Kennecott. From 1911 to 1938, more than 200 million tons of copper ore were transported through Cordova.

The area around Cordova was historically home to the Eyak, with a population of Chugach to the west, and occasional visits from Ahtna and Tlingit people for trade or battle. The last fluent Eyak speaker Marie Smith Jones died in 2008, but the native people, as well as their traditions and lifestyle, continue to thrive in the region. 
Cordova was also once the home of a booming razor clam industry. Between 1916 and the late 1950s, it was known as the &quot;Razor Clam Capital of the World&quot;. Commercial harvest in the area reached as high as 3.5 million pounds. Returns began declining in the late 1950s, presumably due to overharvesting and a large die-off in 1958. The 1964 Good Friday earthquake effectively obliterated the industry; in some areas, the ground was thrust up by as much as six feet, exposing the already depleted clam beds. There has been no commercial harvest in the area since 1988 with the exception of a brief harvest in 1993.
In March 1989 the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef north of Cordova causing one of the most devastating environmental disasters in North America. The Exxon Valdez oil spill severely affected the area&#x27;s salmon and herring populations leading to a recession of the local fishing-reliant economy as well as a disruption to the area&#x27;s ecology. After many years of litigation, 450 million dollars were awarded for compensatory and punitive damages.

==Demographics==
Cordova first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as an incorporated city. It incorporated the year before in 1909.

===Climate===
Cordova has a maritime-influenced subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) bordering on both a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) and a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;), characterised by cool to mild, rainy summers and moderately cold, snowy winters. Precipitation is very heavy year round. The cool temperatures and heavy rainfall are caused by orographic lift. Westerly winds coming off the North Pacific Ocean are forced upwards by the Chugach Mountains which causes the air mass to cool and creates clouds and precipitation.

Yearly average precipitation is , with 125 rainy days out of the year. Snow falls mostly from December to March, and an average of falls yearly. Winter temperatures reach lows of and the warmest summer temperatures are around .

Most official climate data is recorded at the airport, which is 11 miles from the settlement. Temperatures and precipitation vary drastically between the city and the airport, and precipitation at the city is commonly twice that of the airport.

==Economy==
Commercial fishing is the main industry in Cordova. Half of all households in Cordova have at least one person involved in commercial fishing or processing. The fishing fleet mainly fishes the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta area. There are various fisheries in the area, the most economically important of which is the salmon fishery.
All Pacific salmon species except for the cherry salmon are caught. Fishermen use either a purse seine, drift gillnet, or set gillnet to catch the fish. All fisheries are regulated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The fisheries in Alaska have a limited entry permit system. The first fish processing plant near Cordova opened in 1887. In 2009 there were 159 purse seine, 511 drift gillnet, and 27 set gillnet permits fished in the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta area.

==Arts and culture==
Various festivals and celebrations take place throughout the year. The Copper River Delta Shorebird Festival, hosted by the Cordova Chamber of Commerce, takes place each year in early May. Millions of migrating shorebirds stop in the area to rest and feed before finishing their journey north. The most numerous species are the western sandpiper, least sandpiper, and dunlin. This is a popular time for avid and casual bird watchers to visit. Activities, workshops, and bird watching tours are held throughout the week.

The Cordova Iceworm Festival takes place each February. Activities include a parade, talent show, royal crowning ceremony, and various competitions such as an oyster shucking contest, ping pong tournament, and a survival suit race.

Copper River Wild Salmon Festival takes place in July at the Mt. Eyak ski area and includes various events. Salmon Jam Music Festival serves as one of the main events and a fund raiser for Cordova Arts, where local musicians perform followed by professional acts and takes place over the course of Friday and Saturday nights. Taste of Cordova, a wild food and Copper River salmon cook off, usually starts the events. Entries are made with a variety of wild, locally harvested foods and are judged by a panel of guest chefs and food writers. The Alaska Salmon Runs start Saturday morning and include a marathon, half marathon, 10k, 5k, and a 1-mile race on the Copper River Highway. Small Fry activities are educational events for children and families that take place during the races.

<text>Glennallen (&quot;Ciisik’e Na’ &quot; in Ahtna) is a census-designated place (CDP) in the Copper River Census Area in the Unorganized Borough of the U.S. state of Alaska. As of the 2020 census, the population of the CDP was 439, down from 483 in 2010. It is the most populated community in the census area.

==Geography and climate ==

=== Location ===
Glennallen is located at (62.109170, -145.54639; Sec. 23, T004N, R002W, Copper River Meridian), in the Chitina Recording District and Game Management Unit 13.

It lies along the Glenn Highway at its junction with the Richardson Highway, 189 road miles (304 km) east of Anchorage. It is just outside the western boundary of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (0.66%) is water.

=== Climate ===
Glennallen features a dry-summer subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dsc) The city is located in the continental climate zone, with long, cold winters, and relatively warm summers.

==History and culture==
In earlier times, the Ahtna Alaska Natives roamed the Copper River Valley in search of fish and game, both of which are usually plentiful there. Ahtna now live in several communities around Glennallen. In 1899, the U.S. Army built a pack trail for summer use between the port of Valdez and Eagle, which passed through the Copper River Valley. In the early 20th century, the trail was widened and became the Richardson Highway.

During World War II, the United States built a series of military bases in Alaska, primarily for the purpose of supplying aircraft and other war materiel to Russia by way of Alaska and the Russian Far East as part of the Lend-lease program. This made it difficult for the Germans to the west and the Japanese to the south of Russia to interfere with the supply operation. As part of this operation, highways were built to supply the bases. The major highway project of this effort was the Alaska Highway from Dawson Creek, British Columbia, Canada to the existing Richardson Highway at Delta Junction, Alaska and thus to Fairbanks via the Richardson Highway. Another project was the Glenn Highway, which connected Anchorage, Alaska&#x27;s largest city, with the Richardson Highway, and thus with the rest of Alaska, Canada, and the then-48 United States. 

Construction for the Glenn Highway began at a camp on the Richardson Highway in the Copper River Valley named Glennallen after two U.S. Army explorers of the late 19th century: Capt. Edwin Forbes Glenn and Lt. Henry T. Allen. The highway was completed in 1945. Glennallen developed as a small community around the site of the camp. It became a commercial center for motor traffic along the Glenn and Richardson highways. It is one of the few communities in the region that was not built on the site of a Native village.

During the 1950s and 1960s, another highway, the Tok Cut-Off, was constructed from a point 15 miles north of Glennallen to the community of Tok, 135 miles east on the Alaska Highway. This enhanced Glennallen as a commercial center. Also, in 1956, a Jesuit school, Copper Valley School, was opened. This facility increased the population considerably by bringing to the region a number of staff and students from Holy Cross Mission in western Alaska. In 1961 &quot;Glenallen&quot; was officially renamed &quot;Glennallen&quot; by the US Postal Service, adding the extra &#x27;n&#x27;. 

Glennallen&#x27;s economy grew with the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System from 1975–1977 and the continuing service needs of the pipeline. The economy of the area was negatively impacted by the construction of the George Parks Highway, which connected Anchorage to Denali National Park and Fairbanks along the Alaska Railroad route, bypassing Glennallen.

Glennallen Heights utilizes two wells to serve a piped system, and a local private business delivers water by truck to fill home water tanks. The majority of downtown is connected to a piped sewage system operated by The Glennallen Improvement Corp. The sewage system serves 52 homes and businesses, and is being expanded to the Alaska Bible College and the Glennallen Heights subdivision. Most residences have individual septic tank systems, but permafrost and high water tables cause drainage failures.

<text>McCarthy is a census-designated place (CDP) in Copper River Census Area, Alaska, United States. It is in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. The population was 107 at the 2020 census, up from 28 in 2010.

== Geography and location ==
McCarthy is northeast of Cordova at the foot of the Wrangell Mountains. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP of McCarthy has a total area of . None of the area is covered with water. It is connected to the outside world via the McCarthy Road spur of the Edgerton Highway from Chitina, and must be passed through to reach Kennecott, which is also within the McCarthy CDP. Historically, from the end of the road one had to cross the Kennecott River and then a smaller stream using manually propelled ropeways, but a footbridge was built in 1997. Visitors can walk to McCarthy in about 15 minutes, although shuttle vans and buses are available during the tourist season from the bridge to both McCarthy and Kennecott. A private service bridge for vehicle traffic was constructed in 2004 downstream from the footbridge, but use is only available to residents, businesses, and the National Park Service for an annual fee.

== Climate ==
McCarthy has a subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dsc&quot;).

== Demographics ==

McCarthy first reported on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. With the closure of the post office in 1943, it did not report on the census from 1950 to 1980, though it unofficially returned 22 residents in 1980. It returned again beginning in 1990 when it was made a census-designated place (CDP).

As of the census of 2000, there were 42 people, 26 households, and 6 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 47 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 100.00% White.

There were 26 households, out of which 15.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 15.4% were married couples living together, 3.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 73.1% were non-families. 53.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.62 and the average family size was 2.14.

Drawn by an increase in tourism since the founding of Wrangell St. Elias National Park and Preserve, a significant portion of McCarthy&#x27;s summer population resides elsewhere in the winter. This results in them not being counted during the censuses.

In the CDP, the age distribution of the population shows 9.5% under the age of 18, 9.5% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 47.6% from 45 to 64, and 4.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46 years. For every 100 females, there were 147.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 153.3 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $17,188, and the median income for a family was $20,000. The per capita income for the CDP was $16,045. There were no families and 15.2% of the population living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and none of those over 65.

== History ==
For centuries, Athabascans hunted in the area of McCarthy. Chief Nikolai and his band of Athabaskan Natives had a summer camp at Dan Creek, 15 miles east of McCarthy, where they collected copper nuggets from Dan Creek. Their permanent camp was on the Copper River at the village of Taral near Chitina where they fished for salmon.

Copper was discovered between the Kennicott Glacier and McCarthy Creek in 1900, after which Kennicott Mine, Kennecott Mining Company, and company town of Kennecott were created. Due to a clerical error, the corporation and town used the spelling of &quot;Kennecott&quot; instead of &quot;Kennicott&quot;, named for Kennicott Glacier in the valley below the town. The glacier was named after Robert Kennicott, a naturalist who explored in Alaska in the mid-1800s.

Partly because alcoholic beverages and prostitution were forbidden in Kennecott, McCarthy grew as an area to provide illicit services not available in the company town. It grew quickly into a major town with a gymnasium, a hospital, a school, a bar and a brothel. The Copper River and Northwestern Railway reached McCarthy in 1911.
In 1938, the copper deposits were mostly gone and the town was mostly abandoned. The railroad discontinued service that year. Over its 30-year operation, U.S. $200 million in ore was extracted from the mine, making it the richest concentration of copper ore in the world.

The population of McCarthy and Kennecott fell to almost zero until the 1970s, when the area began to draw young people from the many who came to Alaska in the &#x27;70s for adventure and the big money of the Trans Alaska Pipeline project. In the &#x27;80s, after the area was designated Wrangell-St. Elias National Park (1980), it began to draw some adventurous tourists to the new national park. The few people that lived there began to provide a variety of tourist services. There has always been at least one family living in the McCarthy area since 1953.

The old mine buildings, artifacts, and colorful history attract visitors during the summer months. The Kennecott and McCarthy area ranks as one of the United States&#x27; most endangered landmarks by the National Trust for Historic Places. Emergency stabilization of the old buildings has been done and more will be required.

In 2014, the TV show &quot;Edge of Alaska&quot; premiered on Discovery Channel. The show has caused controversy though, as many town residents feel the town is portrayed in a bad light due to the troublesome incidents that have occurred there.

=== 1983 shooting ===
In an attempt to disrupt the Alaska pipeline, 39-year-old Louis D. Hastings, armed with a .223-caliber Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic rifle, murdered six of the 22 citizens of McCarthy on March 1, 1983. The victims were Maxine Edwards, Harley King, Les and Flo Hegland, Tim Nash and Amy Lou Ashenden Nash. He also wounded two people. In July 1984, Hastings was sentenced to 634 years in prison.

This case, and the town of McCarthy, were showcased on the Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Alaska Ice Cold Killers&quot; episode &quot;Frozen Terror&quot;.

==History==
===Murder of Mandy Lemaire===
On August 22, 1991, 11-year-old Tazlina resident Mandy Lemaire was reported missing by her parents, triggering a massive search by law enforcement and townspeople. Ten days later, a volunteer searcher found Lemaire&#x27;s body in a wooded area. Authorities suspected 61-year-old retiree Charles Smithart of the murder when another local man, Dave DeForest, told police he had observed Smithart driving near Mandy&#x27;s house on the day she went missing. Police and forensic investigators found considerable trace evidence in Smithart&#x27;s truck that suggested Mandy&#x27;s presence in the vehicle, and learned from Smithart&#x27;s eldest daughter that he had raped her and her sisters when they were Lemaire&#x27;s age.

In 1993, Smithart was tried for and convicted of first-degree kidnapping, first-degree sexual battery on a minor, and first-degree murder. He was sentenced to serve 114 years in prison. In 1999, the Alaska Supreme Court overturned Smithart&#x27;s conviction, ruling that the lower court improperly denied his defense counsel the right to assert that prosecution witness Dave DeForest had committed the crime. All charges were automatically dismissed in 2000, after Smithart died of lung cancer in prison, awaiting a retrial.

Tazlina and the Lemaire murder were featured on the true-crime television series &quot;Forensic Files&quot;, in the season 8 episode &quot;Sphere of Influence&quot;. The television network &quot;Investigation Discovery&quot; aired two shows about the murder; the series &quot;Ice Cold Killers&quot;, episode titled &quot;Fear Thy Neighbor&quot; aired in 2014; and the special &quot;Vanished in Alaska&quot; in 2018.

<text>Tonsina is a census-designated place (CDP) in Copper River Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2020 census the population was 55, down from 78 in 2010.

Tonsina is part of the Copper River Valley area. The centerpiece of Tonsina valley is the Tonsina River Lodge. This roadhouse alongside the Richardson Highway consists of a bar, restaurant, gas station, convenience and liquor store, laundromat and showers. There is also a camping area, RV park and motel. A main attraction of the roadhouse is the historic hotel.

The Tonsina River Lodge is a rambling, shambling, gravel-covered spread, with weatherbeaten buildings. The historic hotel is an orange, three story Army barracks with a red tin roof. It once was a brothel. The lodge is at the end of an airplane runway. The lodge sits in the foothills of several towering, snow-capped mountain ranges, next to a stream. In 2006, the flooding from the stream took out the two-lane concrete bridge that crosses the stream. Connecting Valdez to Anchorage, the Richardson Highway bridge was repaired in two weeks.

<text>Valdez ( ; Alutiiq: ) is a city in the Chugach Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. According to the 2020 US Census, the population of the city is 3,985, up from 3,976 in 2010. It is the third most populated city in Alaska&#x27;s Unorganized Borough.

The city was named in 1790 after the Spanish Navy Minister Antonio Valdés y Fernández Bazán. A former Gold Rush town, it is located at the head of Port Valdez on the eastern side of Prince William Sound. The city was incorporated in 1901, but did not flourish until after the road link to Fairbanks was constructed in 1910. It suffered catastrophic damage during the 1964 Alaska earthquake, and is located near the site of the disastrous 1989 &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil tanker spill. Today, it is one of the most important ports in Alaska, a commercial fishing port as well as a freight terminal. Valdez is also the terminus for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.

==History==
=== Spanish beginnings ===
The port of Valdez was named in 1790 by the Spanish explorer Salvador Fidalgo after the Spanish naval officer Antonio Valdés y Fernández Bazán.

In 1790, within the framework of the expeditions of Spain in the Pacific Northwest, under the direction of Juan Vicente de Güemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, then viceroy of New Spain, Salvador Fidalgo was sent to San Lorenzo de Nootka where they founded the Fort of Saint Michael (Nutka). On May 5, 1790, Fidalgo sailed with the San Carlos de Nutka towards Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet, off the coast of Alaska, and a few weeks later, he anchored off present-day Cordova, Alaska. The expedition found no signs of a Russian presence and traded with natives in the area. On June 3 they disembarked on the coast of present-day Orca Inlet, and, in a solemn ceremony, Fidalgo erected a large wooden cross and reaffirmed Spanish sovereignty over the territory, naming it &quot;Puerto Córdova.&quot; Fidalgo continued along the Alaskan coast, until he reached Point Gravina on June 10, where he celebrated another act of reaffirmation of Spanish sovereignty. On June 15, they discovered a port, which they named Puerto Valdés, in honor of Antonio Valdés y Fernández Bazán, then &quot;Secretary of State of the Universal Office of the Navy and the Indies&quot; (a position equivalent to Minister for the affairs of the Spanish Navy and the four Spanish Viceroyalties of the Americas, including the Captaincy General of the Philippines).

In the Nootka Conventions, which followed the Nootka crisis, Spain granted Great Britain access rights to the Pacific Northwest, although it did not establish the boundary with Spanish California, nor did it cede Spanish rights in the area. Spain later relinquished any remaining claim to territory north of the 42nd parallel to the United States as part of the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819.

=== Mining town ===
A scam to lure prospectors off the Klondike Gold Rush trail led to a town being developed there in 1898. Some steamship companies promoted the Valdez Glacier Trail as a better route for miners to reach the Klondike gold fields and discover new ones in the Copper River country of interior Alaska than that from Skagway. The prospectors who believed the promotion found that they had been deceived. The glacier trail was twice as long and steep as reported, and many men died attempting the crossing, in part by contracting scurvy during the long cold winter without adequate supplies. The town did not flourish until after the construction of the Richardson Highway in 1910, which connected Valdez and Fairbanks. With a new road and its ice-free port, Valdez became permanently established as the first overland supply route into the interior of Alaska. The highway was open in summer-only until 1950, when it started operating as a year-round route.
In 1907, a shootout between two rival railroad companies ended Valdez&#x27;s hope of becoming the railroad link from tidewater to the Kennicott Copper Mine. The mine, located in the heart of the Wrangell-St. Elias Mountains, was one of the richest copper ore deposits on the continent. The exact location of the right-of-way dispute, in which one man was killed and several injured, is located at the southern entrance of Keystone Canyon on the Valdez side. A half-completed tunnel in the canyon marks the end of railroad days in Valdez. A rail line to Kennicott was later established from the coastal city of Cordova.

===Good Friday earthquake===
The city of Valdez was badly shaken and damaged in the 1964 Good Friday earthquake. Soil liquefaction of the glacial silt that formed the city&#x27;s foundation led to a massive underwater landslide, which caused a section of the city&#x27;s shoreline to break off and sink into the sea. The underwater soil displacement caused a local tsunami high that traveled westward, away from the city and down Valdez Bay. 32 men, women, and children were on the city&#x27;s main freight dock to help with and watch the unloading of the SS &quot;Chena,&quot; a supply ship that came to Valdez regularly. All 32 people died as the dock collapsed into the ocean with the violent landslide. There were no deaths in the town.

Residents continued to live there for an additional three years while a new site was being prepared on more stable ground away. The new construction was supervised by the Army Corps of Engineers. They transported 54 houses and buildings by truck to the new site, to re-establish the new city at its present location. The original town site was dismantled, abandoned and eventually burned down.

In the early 1900s, city leaders George Cheever Hazelet and Andrew Jackson Meals dreamed of moving the original site of Valdez to higher, more stable ground. Long after they were gone, their vision was finally realized. The 1964 earthquake was the defining moment. What is now known as &quot;Old Town&quot; was devastated. The descendants of both men responded by revitalizing the old partnership of 1898. They formed The Port Valdez Company to donate 115 acres of land, where the failed &quot;Hazeletville&quot; development once stood, so the City of Valdez could rebuild and thrive again.
===Trans-Alaska pipeline===
From 1975 to 1977, the Trans-Alaska pipeline was built to carry oil from the Prudhoe Bay oil fields in northern Alaska to a terminal in Valdez, the nearest ice-free port. Oil is loaded onto tanker ships for transport. The construction and operation of the pipeline and terminal boosted the economy of Valdez. The first tanker to be loaded with pipeline oil was the &quot;ARCO Juneau&quot; in early August 1977, bound for the Cherry Point Refinery in 

The 1989 &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill occurred as the oil tanker &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; was leaving the terminal at Valdez full of oil. The spill occurred at Bligh Reef, about from Valdez. Although the oil did not reach Valdez, it devastated much of the marine life in the surrounding area. The clean-up of the oil caused a short-term boost to the economy of Valdez.

===2014 avalanches===
On January 24, 2014, a major avalanche occurred just outside Valdez at Mile 16 near Keystone Canyon, prompting the closure of the only highway in or out of town. On January 25, Alaska DOT triggered another massive slide that further choked the roadway. Due to weather conditions at the time, the avalanche dammed the Lowe River, creating a half-mile-long lake that stalled snow removal efforts for nearly a week. The blockage was dubbed the &quot;Damalanche&quot; by local city officials after a name coined by local resident, Joshua Buffington. News of this event spread to media outlets nationwide. Once the water receded, crews worked around the clock to clear about 200,000 cubic yards of snow in five days. No one was injured during this incident.


==Geography==

Valdez is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , comprising 19.88%, is water.

Valdez is located near the head of a deep fjord in the Prince William Sound in Alaska. It is surrounded by the Chugach Mountains, which are heavily glaciated; nearby Shoup Glacier, which feeds Shoup Bay, served as a source of ice for residents of the town at the turn of the 20th century. Valdez is the northernmost port in North America that is ice-free year-round. The northernmost point of the coastal Pacific temperate rain forest is in Valdez, on Blueberry Hill. The only road access is via the Richardson Highway, which traverses Thompson Pass and Keystone Canyon to end at Valdez.

===Climate===
Despite the presence of temperate rainforest, Valdez under the Köppen climate classification has a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;): its winters, though much warmer than most climates of this type, are not sufficiently mild, as those of, say, Ketchikan, Kodiak, or even nearby Cordova are, to fit into the oceanic or subpolar oceanic climate category.

According to the Weather Channel and NOAA, Valdez is the snowiest city in the United States, with an average of over per year. There have been more than of snow in five separate months (not all in the same year).


==Demographics==
Valdez first appeared on the 1900 U.S. Census as the unincorporated village of &quot;Valdes.&quot; It formally incorporated as Valdez in 1901, and has reported in every successive census. The original townsite was relocated in 1967 from the east side to the north side of Port Valdez after the 1964 Good Friday Earthquake, but still lays within the present city limits.

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 3,985 people living in Valdez. The racial makeup of the city was 75.7% White, 0.8% Black, 7.8% Native American or Alaska Native, 2.6% Asian, 0.8% Pacific Islander, 2.0% from some other race, and 10.3% from two or more races. 6.8% were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 1,758 housing units in the city, with 1,610 total households. The median age was 40 years. The median income for a household was $99,151 and the median income for a family was $102,832. 4.4% of the population was below the poverty line, including 7.6% of those under age 18 and 3.8% of those over 65.

As of the 2010 census, there were 3,976 people. The racial makeup was 78.6% White, 0.6% Black, 7.6% Native American or Alaska Native, 1.9% Asian, 0.8% Pacific Islander and 5.8% from two or more races. 4.7% were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

==Economy==
Valdez is a fishing port, both for commercial and sport fishing. Freight moves through Valdez bound for the interior of Alaska. Sightseeing of the marine life and glaciers, together with both deep-sea fishing, and heli skiing support a tourist industry in Valdez. The oil from the Trans-Alaska pipeline is loaded onto ships at the Valdez oil terminal.

Alyeska Pipeline Service Company is one of the biggest employers in Valdez.

Valdez is connected to the interior of Alaska by the Richardson Highway, and is a port of call in the Alaska Marine Highway ferry system. Just north of Valdez on the highway is Thompson Pass, which has spectacular waterfalls and glaciers next to the highway. Thompson Pass is also known for treacherous driving conditions during the winter.

The Valdez Airport, also known as Pioneer Field, has regular scheduled service with Ravn Alaska.

Valdez hosted the World Extreme Skiing Championship (WESC) in the early 1990s.

==Media and culture==
Despite its small size, Valdez was at one time home to two weekly newspapers, the &quot;Valdez Star&quot; and the &quot;Valdez Vanguard&quot;. In 2004, the &quot;Star&quot; bought out the &quot;Vanguard&quot;.

Valdez is also home to radio broadcasters KCHU, KVAK, and KVAK-FM.

Valdez is also home to the Last Frontier Theatre Conference, hosted by the Prince William Sound College. The annual conference attracts playwrights and actors from around the United States.

&quot;On Deadly Ground&quot; (1994) was filmed near Worthington Glacier, as well as the Valdez Civic Center and Valdez Airport, and outside Valdez on Thompson Pass in the Chugach Mountains.

==Oil terminal==
The Valdez Marine Terminal is an oil port in Valdez, at the southern end of the Alaska Pipeline. The terminal was the point of departure for the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; just prior to the oil spill.

There are 14 active aboveground crude oil storage tanks at the terminal, and an average of three to five oil tankers depart from the terminal each week. Since the pipeline became operational in 1976, more than 19,000 tankers full of oil have left the terminal.

The terminal has 2 operational loading berths.

<text>Whittier is a city at the head of the Passage Canal in the U.S. state of Alaska, about southeast of Anchorage. The city is within the Chugach Census Area, one of the two entities established in 2019 when the former Valdez–Cordova Census Area was dissolved.

The town&#x27;s population was 272 at the 2020 census, having increased from 220 in 2010. Almost all of its residents live in the Begich Towers Condominium, earning it the nickname of a &quot;town under one roof&quot;.

Whittier has an extremely wet climate, receiving an average of of precipitation per year. It is a port for the Alaska Marine Highway.

==History==
The region occupied by Whittier was once part of the portage route of the Chugach people native to Prince William Sound. Later, the passage was used by Russian and American explorers, and by prospecting miners during the Klondike Gold Rush. The nearby Whittier Glacier was named for American poet John Greenleaf Whittier in 1915, and the town eventually took the name as well.

During World War II, the United States Army constructed a military facility, complete with port and railroad, near Whittier Glacier and named the facility Camp Sullivan. The spur of the Alaska Railroad to Camp Sullivan was completed in 1943, and the port became the entrance for United States soldiers into Alaska.

The two buildings that dominate the town were built after World War II. The 14-story Hodge Building (renamed Begich Towers) was completed in 1957 and contains 150 two-and-three-bedroom apartments plus bachelor efficiency units. Dependent families and Civil Service employees were moved into this high-rise. The Whittier School was connected by a tunnel at the base of the west tower so students could safely access school on days with bad weather. The building was named in honor of Colonel Walter William Hodge, who was a civil engineer and the commanding officer of 93rd Engineer Regiment on the Alcan Highway.

The other main structure in town, the Buckner Building, was completed in 1953, and was called the &quot;city under one roof&quot;. The Buckner Building was eventually abandoned. Buckner and Begich Towers were at one time the largest buildings in Alaska. The Begich Towers building became a condominium and, along with the two-story private residence known as Whittier Manor, houses a majority of the town&#x27;s residents.

The port at Whittier was an active Army facility until 1960. In 1962, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed a petroleum products terminal, a pumping station and a , pipeline to Anchorage in Whittier.

On March 27, 1964, Whittier suffered over $10 million worth of damage in what became known as the Good Friday earthquake. As of 2022, the earthquake remains the largest U.S. earthquake, measuring 9.2 on the moment magnitude scale, and having caused tsunamis along the West Coast of the U.S. The tsunami that hit Whittier reached a height of and killed 13 people.

Whittier was incorporated in 1969 and eventually became a port of call for cruise ships. It is utilized by local operations and about 100-passenger mid-sized cruise ships. When the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel opened to public access in 2000, it became the first highway to connect Whittier to Anchorage and inner Alaska—previously, the only ways to reach the town had been rail, boat and plane.

After the tunnel expanded access to Whittier, it began to be visited by larger cruise lines. It is the embarkation/debarkation point of one-way cruises from Anchorage to Vancouver by Princess Tours. Whittier is also popular with tourists, photographers, outdoor enthusiasts, paddlers, hikers, sport fishermen, and hunters because of its abundance of wildlife and natural beauty. Whittier is located within the Chugach National Forest, the second-largest national forest in the U.S.

==Facilities, utilities, and healthcare==
The City operates the water and piped sewer system and the central watering point. Approximately 90% of homes are connected. There is a sewage lagoon available for individuals to dump their honey buckets.

The City Council is the policy-making body for the utility. Water is derived from the Alakanuk Slough; it is treated, stored in a tank, and piped to most of the community. In 1998, 83 homes, the school and teachers&#x27; housing were connected to a new piped system. New facilities include a water treatment plant, heated 300,000-gal. water storage tank, vacuum sewage plant, sewage lagoon, Arctic piping, and household plumbing.

A new subdivision is currently underway, and nine homes will be connected to the piped utilities. The city has funding from DEC for service connections to 20 homes. Ten homes have been moved from the erosion zone on the river bank and are ready for service. The city is planning to move an additional 10 homes.

AVCP is building a 9-home subdivision, including water and sewer mains and service connections, for occupancy in 2002. The city completed a feasibility study for service area 7, which is the area across the river, and would like to obtain funding to make this expansion. The landfill is reported as inactive.

Electricity is provided by AVEC. Local hospitals or health clinics include Alakanuk Health Clinic and Pearl E. Johnson Sub-Regional Clinic in Emmonak. Alakanuk Health Clinic is a Primary Health Care facility. Alakanuk is classified as an isolated village, located in EMS Region 7A in the Yukon/Kuskokwim Region. Emergency Services have coastal and air access. Emergency service is provided by a health aide.

The sale, importation and possession of alcohol are banned in the village.

==Education==
K-12 students are zoned for Alakanuk School.

==Economy and Transportation==
Alakanuk experiences a seasonal economy. 76 residents hold commercial fishing permits. Many have gill net permits, and set net fishermen sell their salmon to Seattle fish buyers. Poor fish returns since 1998 have significantly affected the community.

Government employment and retail businesses provide limited year-round employment. Salmon, beluga whale, seal, moose and rabbit provide food sources. Some residents trap. Many residents travel to Emmonak to shop and attend social events and basketball tournaments.

Alakanuk Airport, a State-owned 2,200&#x27; long by 55&#x27; wide gravel airstrip, is available for air transport. However, an airport relocation project is underway due to erosion. Grant Aviation, Hageland Aviation and Tanana Air Service offer passenger flight service. Alakanuk is easily accessible from the Yukon River and Bering Sea by barge and riverboat. Most passengers and mail arrive by air.

There are no roads connecting Alakanuk with other population centers in the region, but ice roads are used in winter. Snow machines and boats are used for local travel.

<text>Chevak (&quot;Cevʼaq &quot;, which means &quot;cut-through channel&quot; in Chevak Cup’ik) is a city in Kusilvak Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2020 census the population was 951, up from 938 in 2010.

There is a tri-language system in Chevak; English, Cup’ik, and a mixture of the two languages. The people in Chevak speak a dialect of Central Yup&#x27;ik, Cup&#x27;ik (pr. Chew-pick), and identify themselves as Cup&#x27;ik people rather than Yup&#x27;ik. This unique identity has allowed them to form a single-site school district, the Kashunamiut School District, rather than joining a neighboring Yup&#x27;ik school district. The Cup&#x27;ik dialect is distinguished from Yup&#x27;ik by the change of &quot;y&quot; sounds into &quot;ch&quot; sounds, represented by the letter &quot;c&quot;, and by some words that are completely different from Yup&#x27;ik words.

==Geography==
Chevak is located at (61.527673, -165.578702) in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region of southwest Alaska, approximately 6 miles from the Bering Sea coastline, 18 miles east of Hooper Bay and 26 miles south of Scammon Bay.

In addition, electrical power is supplied by four diesel generators capable of supplying up to a combined 1828 kilowatts of electricity year-round, with the tank farm storing up to 302,000 gallons of diesel fuel. This, in addition to the 400 kilowatts generated by the wind turbines, gives Chevak’s electrical grid a total capacity of 2228 kilowatts.

As of 2022, all buildings in Chevak have running water and piped sewage, supported by a central water treatment facility built in 1984, and a central wastewater treatment plant built in 2001. An outage, due to the old school fire in 2021, affected service to the eastern half of Chevak, with many residents forced to resort back to honey buckets as toilets.

==Old Chevak (1940)==

Chevak first appeared on the 1940 U.S. Census as an unincorporated native village. At the time it was located above the junction of the Keoklevik &amp; Kashunuk Rivers at an altitude of 7 feet. In the 1940s, residents relocated 9 miles northwest to a new village due to flooding from high storm tides. The old site became Old Chevak and was abandoned and did not report again on the census.

==New Chevak (1950)==
The new Chevak appeared on the 1950 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village, relocated from its original site 9 miles away on higher ground. It formally incorporated as a city in 1967.

The current Chevak school was built in 2005, and currently serves approximately 360 students via approximately 60 staff. In 2021, the old school, shut down for renovations and removal of toxins such as asbestos, was destroyed in a fire. The old school was planned to be turned into a community center, before its destruction. Two individuals went missing at the time of the fire, which resulted in the Alaska State Troopers launching an investigation. The cause of the fire is still unknown. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation is providing 2.5 million dollars in funds towards the cleanup effort and removal of debris from the destroyed school.

==Demographics==

The predecessor village to Marshall first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as the Inuit village of &quot;Ooglovia.&quot; It was also known as Uglovaia. It would not appear again on the census. Marshall first appeared on the 1940 U.S. Census as the unincorporated village of Fortuna Ledge. In 1950, the name was changed to Marshall. It continued to return as Marshall in 1960 and 1970, but in the latter year incorporated as the city of Fortuna Ledge. It reported as Fortuna Ledge on the 1980 census, but the city reverted to the name of Marshall in 1984. It has continued to report as Marshall since the 1990 census.

As of the census of 2000, there were 349 people, 91 households, and 73 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 104 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 2.01% White, 95.99% Alaska Native or Native American, and 2.01% from two or more races. 0.29% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 91 households, out of which 59.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.4% were married couples living together, 22.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 18.7% were non-families. 15.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 1.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The median income for a household in the city was $32,917, and the median income for a family was $37,750. Males had a median income of $25,469 versus $37,917 for females. The per capita income for the city was $9,597. About 20.8% of families and 28.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 32.7% of those under age 18 and 20.0% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
Marshall&#x27;s previous name, changed in 1984, from Fortuna Ledge, was a mining village in the 1800s and early 1900s, with mining operations in Wilson Creek, just down river from the Ledge. With that, many Alaska Natives were moved from other villages, as far away as Unalakleet, Ohogamuit and Takchak. With that, there are two main Native groups, the Yupik descendants, hailing from both Takchak and Ohogamuit, and the Inupiaq descendants, hailing from Unalakleet. Along with those of Native descent, Marshall hosts a population of people of Russian descendant mixed with Inupiaqs and has become a Yup&#x27;ik/Inupiaq/Russian community. Marshall was reportedly named for Vice-president Thomas Riley Marshall, who served from 1913 to 1921.

==Education==
K-12 students attend Marshall School, operated by the Lower Yukon School District.

<doc id="105706" wikidata="Q5365852" url="?curid=105706" title="High-energy phosphate">
<text>High-energy phosphate can mean one of two things:

* The phosphate-phosphate (phosphoanhydride/phosphoric anhydride/macroergic/phosphagen) bonds formed when compounds such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are created.
* The compounds that contain these bonds, which include the nucleoside diphosphates and nucleoside triphosphates, and the high-energy storage compounds of the muscle, the phosphagens. When people speak of a high-energy phosphate pool, they speak of the total concentration of these compounds with these high-energy bonds.

==Description==
High-energy phosphate bonds are usually pyrophosphate bonds, acid anhydride linkages formed by taking phosphoric acid derivatives and dehydrating them. As a consequence, the hydrolysis of these bonds is exergonic under physiological conditions, releasing Gibbs free energy.

Except for PPi → 2 Pi, these reactions are, in general, not allowed to go uncontrolled in the human cell but are instead coupled to other processes needing energy to drive them to completion. Thus, high-energy phosphate reactions can:
* provide energy to cellular processes, allowing them to run
* couple processes to a particular nucleoside, allowing for regulatory control of the process
* drive a reaction out of equilibrium (drive it &quot;to the right&quot;) by promoting one direction of the reaction faster than the equilibrium can relax.

The one exception is of value because it allows a single hydrolysis, ATP + H2O → AMP + PPi, to effectively supply the energy of hydrolysis of two high-energy bonds, with the hydrolysis of PPi being allowed to go to completion in a separate reaction. The AMP is regenerated to ATP in two steps, with the equilibrium reaction ATP + AMP ↔ 2ADP, followed by regeneration of ATP by the usual means, oxidative phosphorylation or other energy-producing pathways such as glycolysis.

Often, high-energy phosphate bonds are denoted by the character &#x27;~&#x27;. In this &quot;squiggle&quot; notation, ATP becomes A-P~P~P. The squiggle notation was invented by Fritz Albert Lipmann, who first proposed ATP as the main energy transfer molecule of the cell, in 1941. Lipmann&#x27;s notation emphasizes the special nature of these bonds. Stryer states: 

The term &#x27;high energy&#x27; with respect to these bonds can be misleading because the negative free energy change is not due directly to the breaking of the bonds themselves. The breaking of these bonds, like the breaking of most bonds, is endergonic and consumes energy rather than releasing it. The negative free energy change comes instead from the fact that the bonds formed after hydrolysis - or the phosphorylation of a residue by ATP - are lower in energy than the bonds present before hydrolysis. (This includes &quot;all&quot; of the bonds involved in the reaction, not just the phosphate bonds themselves). This effect is due to a number of factors including increased resonance stabilization and solvation of the products relative to the reactants, and destabilization of the reactants due to electrostatic repulsion between neighboring phosphorus atoms.

<doc id="105709" wikidata="Q498002" url="?curid=105709" title="Aerial tramway">
<text>An aerial tramway, aerial tram, sky tram, cable car or aerial cablecar, aerial cableway, telepherique (French), or Seilbahn (German) is a type of aerial lift which uses one or two stationary cables for support, with a third moving cable providing propulsion. With this form of lift, the grip of an aerial tramway cabin is fixed onto the propulsion cable and cannot be decoupled from it during operation. Aerial tramways usually provide lower line capacities and longer wait times than gondola lifts.

== Terminology ==
&quot;Cable car&quot; is the usual term in British English, where &quot;tramway&quot; generally refers to a railed street tramway. In American English, &quot;cable car&quot; may additionally refer to a cable-pulled street tramway with detachable vehicles (e.g., San Francisco&#x27;s cable cars). Consequently careful phrasing is necessary to prevent confusion.

It is also sometimes called a &quot;ropeway&quot; or even incorrectly referred to as a gondola lift. A gondola lift has cabins suspended from a continuously circulating cable whereas aerial trams simply shuttle back and forth on cables. In Japan, the two are considered as the same category of vehicle and called &quot;ropeway&quot;, while the term &quot;cable car&quot; refers to both ground-level cable cars and funiculars. An aerial railway where the vehicles are suspended from a fixed track as opposed to a cable is known as a suspension railway.

== Overview ==
An aerial tramway consists of one or two fixed cables (called &quot;track cables&quot;), one loop of cable (called a &quot;haulage rope&quot;), and one or two passenger or cargo cabins. The fixed cables provide support for the cabins while the haulage rope, by means of a grip, is solidly connected to the truck (the wheel set that rolls on the track cables). An electric motor drives the haulage rope which provides propulsion. Aerial tramways are constructed as &quot;reversible systems&quot;; vehicles shuttling back and forth between two end terminals and propelled by a cable loop which stops and reverses direction when the cabins arrive at the end stations. Aerial tramways differ from gondola lifts in that gondola lifts are considered &quot;continuous systems&quot; (cabins attached onto a &quot;circulating&quot; haul cable that moves continuously).

Two-car tramways use a &quot;jig-back&quot; system: a large electric motor is located at the bottom of the tramway so that it effectively pulls one cabin down, using that cabin&#x27;s weight to help pull the other cabin up. A similar system of cables is used in a funicular railway. The two passenger or cargo cabins, which carry from 4 to over 150 people, are situated at opposite ends of the loops of cable. Thus, while one is coming up, the other is going down the mountain, and they pass each other midway on the cable span.

Some aerial trams have only one cabin, which lends itself better to systems with small elevation changes along the cable run.

== History ==
The first design of an aerial lift was by Croatian polymath Fausto Veranzio, and the first operational aerial tram was built in 1644 by Adam Wybe in Gdańsk, Poland. It was moved by horses and used to move soil over the river to build defences. It is called the first known cable lift in European history and precedes the invention of steel cables. It is not known how long this lift was used. Germany installed the second cable lift 230 years later, now using iron wire cable.

=== In mining ===

Aerial tramways are sometimes used in mountainous regions to carry ore from a mine located high on the mountain to an ore mill located at a lower elevation. Ore tramways were common in the early 20th century at the mines in North and South America. One can still be seen in the San Juan Mountains of the US state of Colorado. Another famous use of aerial tramways was at the Kennecott Copper mine in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, Alaska.

Other firms entered the mining tramway business, including Otto, Leschen, Breco Ropeways Ltd., Ceretti and Tanfani, and Riblet. A major British contributor was Bullivant, which became a constituent of British Ropes in 1924.

=== Moving people ===

In the beginning of the 20th century, the rise of the middle class and the leisure industry allowed for investment in sight-seeing transport. Prior to 1893, a combined goods and passenger carrying cableway was installed at Gibraltar. Initially, its passengers were military personnel. An 1893 industry publication said of a two-mile system in Hong Kong that it &quot;is the only wire tramway which has been erected exclusively for the carriage of individuals&quot; (albeit workmen). After the pioneer cable car suitable for public transport on Mount Ulia in 1907 (San Sebastián, Spain) by Leonardo Torres Quevedo and the Wetterhorn Elevator (Grindelwald, Switzerland) in 1908, others to the top of high peaks in the Alps of Austria, Germany and Switzerland resulted. They were much less expensive to build than the earlier rack railway.

One of the first aerial trams was at Chamonix, while others in Switzerland, and Garmisch soon followed. From this, it was a natural transposition to build ski lifts and chairlifts. The first cable car in North America was at Cannon Mountain in Franconia, New Hampshire in 1938.

Many aerial tramways were built by Von Roll Ltd. of Switzerland, later acquired by Austrian lift manufacturer Doppelmayr. Other German, Swiss, and Austrian firms played an important role in the cable car business: Bleichert, Heckel, Pohlig, PHB (Pohlig-Heckel-Bleichert), Garaventa and Waagner-Biró. Now there are three groups dominating the world market: Doppelmayr Garaventa Group, Leitner Group, and Poma, the last two being owned by one person.

Some aerial tramways have their own propulsion, such as the Lasso Mule or the Josef Mountain Aerial Tramway near Merano, Italy.

=== Urban transport ===
While typically used for ski resorts, aerial tramways have come into use in the urban environment. The 1976 Roosevelt Island Tramway in New York City, the 2022 Rakavlit cable car in Haifa, Israel and the 2006 Portland Aerial Tram are examples where this technology has been successfully adapted for public transport.

=== Telpherage ===
The telpherage concept was first publicised in 1883 and several experimental lines were constructed. It was designed to compete not with railways, but with horses and carts.

The first commercial telpherage line was in Glynde, which is in Sussex, England. It was built to connect a newly opened clay pit to the local railway station and opened in 1885.

=== Double deckers ===
There are aerial tramways with double deck cabins. The Vanoise Express cable car carries 200 people in each cabin at a height of over the Ponturin gorge in France. The Shinhotaka Ropeway carries 121 people in each cabin at Mount Hotaka in Japan. The CabriO cable car to the summit of the Stanserhorn in Switzerland carries 60 persons, with the upper floor accommodating 30 people in the open air.

== List of accidents ==
Despite the introduction of various safety measures (back-up power generators, evacuation plans, etc.) there have been several serious incidents on aerial tramways, some fatal.
* August 29, 1961: A military plane split the hauling cable of the Vallée Blanche Aerial Tramway on the Aiguille du Midi in the Mont Blanc massif: six people killed.
* July 9, 1974: Ulriksbanen is an aerial tramway in Bergen, Norway, operated by a tow rope, which hauls it, and a carrying rope. On July 9, 1974, as the carriage reached its destination at the top station and just as the carriage operator was about to open the doors, the tow rope broke. The carriage operator was thrown into the back of the vehicle, preventing him from reaching the emergency brake. The carriage began whizzing down the still intact carrying rope, gathering speed quickly and approaching the first vertical mast about 70meters away. Because the tow rope was broken, it was no longer taut at the point where it crossed over the the carriage crossed the mast, the broken tow rope jammed up and caused the carriage to jump off the carrying rope and begin to free-fall straight down towards the ground 15meters below. The carriage crashed to the ground on a downslope, causing the carriage to careen down the mountainside a further 30meters before it was crushed up against some boulders, finally coming to a stop. Four of the eight occupants were killed.
* March 9, 1976: In the Italian Dolomites at Cavalese, a cab fell after a rope broke, killing 43. &quot;(See 1976 Cavalese cable car crash)&quot;
* April 15, 1978: In a storm, two carrying ropes of the Squaw Valley Aerial Tramway in California fell from the aerial tramway support tower. One of the ropes partly destroyed the cabin. Four were killed, 32 injured.

==History==
===Prior to Alaska Purchase===
The region of Kake has been inhabited by the Tlingit indigenous people for thousands of years.

The Tlingit of the Kake region gained a reputation among early European and American explorers of being strong and powerful. Some conflicts with early explorers have been documented by historians. Some scholars believe the first explorer to enter Tlingit lands was the Briton Francis Drake, who traveled to the area near present-day Kake in 1579, although other scholars dispute this theory.

In the early 19th century Kake was visited by American maritime fur traders seeking sea otter skins, such as the ship &quot;Atahualpa&quot; in 1805 and &quot;Otter&quot; in 1811. Kake was also visited by the Russian Golovin Expedition in 1818. Mikhail Tikhanov, an artist with the expedition, painted a watercolor of the Tlingit chief Kotlean.

===After Alaska Purchase===

In the February 1869 Kake War the destroyed three deserted villages and two forts near present-day Kake. Prior to the conflict, two white trappers were killed by the Kake in retribution for the death of two Kake departing Sitka. Sitka was the site of a standoff between the Army and some Tlingits who refused to surrender Chief Colchika, who was involved in an altercation in Fort Sitka. While no Kake died in the destruction of the villages, except perhaps for a single old woman, some died over the winter due to the loss of winter stores, canoes, and shelter led to the death. The villages were not rebuilt, and their inhabitants dispersed to other villages or remained in the vicinity, eventually rebuilding the present day Kake.

On September 25, 2024, the U.S. Navy formally apologized to the people of Kake for the destruction of the village.

Kake is the site of a 128-foot totem pole, one of the world&#x27;s largest, carved in 1967 for the Alaska Purchase centennial.

==Government==
A first-class city, Kake has a mayor-council form of government which is composed of a mayor and six council members. The city also has a city manager.

==Education==
The Kake City School District operates the city&#x27;s school.

<text>Petersburg is a census-designated place (CDP) in and essentially the borough seat of Petersburg Borough, Alaska, United States. The population was 3,043 at the 2020 census, up from 2,948 in 2010.

The borough encompasses Petersburg and Kupreanof, plus mostly uninhabited areas stretching to the Canadian–American border and the southern boundary of the City and Borough of Juneau. While the city of Petersburg ceased to exist as a separate administrative entity (the borough assembly created a service area to assume operation of the former city&#x27;s services), the tiny city of Kupreanof remains separate within the borough.

==History==

Tlingits from Kupreanof Island had long used a summer fish camp at the north end of Mitkof Island. Earlier cultures of indigenous people also used the island: remnants of fish traps and some petroglyphs have been carbon-dated back some 10,000 years.

European explorers to Mitkof Island encountered the Tlingit. In the nineteenth century, Peter Buschmann, a Norwegian immigrant, settled here, building a cannery, sawmill, docks and early structures. The settlement was named Petersburg after him, and it flourished as a fishing port. Icebergs from the nearby LeConte Glacier provided a source for cooling fish.
Petersburg originally incorporated as a town on April 2, 1910. The town had attracted mostly immigrants of Scandinavian origin, thus giving Petersburg the nickname &quot;Little Norway&quot;. The Sons of Norway hall was built on one of the piers. Three other canneries were built and the four have operated continuously since. With the establishment of the cannery, Alaskan Natives, including Chief John Lott, began to work there and live year-round at the site.

The 1939 Slattery Report on Alaskan development identified the region as one of the areas where new settlements would be established through Jewish immigration. This plan was never implemented.
Fisheries were the mainstay of the economy. In 1965, Petersburg fishermen founded Icicle Seafoods. Fishermen Gordon Jensen and Magnus Martens teamed up with managers Tom Thompson and Bob Thorstenson, Sr. to organize a group of fishermen to purchase the Pacific American Fisheries (PAF) plant (the original Buschmann cannery) at a time when the seafood industry seemed in decline. PAF was traded on the NYSE and had been one of the largest processors in Alaska for a half century. The shareholders, including Board members Fred File, Fred Haltiner, Jr., Robin Leekley, Jeff Pfundt, Aril Mathisen, Bud Samuelson and many others (Hofstads, Otness, and Petersons to name a few) began their work to create, improve and institute the fisheries that sustain Petersburg and many other coastal communities in Alaska today. The company was originally known as PFI but in 1977 changed its name officially to Icicle Seafoods.


Petersburg incorporated as a borough in January 2013, encompassing Petersburg and Kupreanof, plus mostly uninhabited areas stretching to the Canada–US border and the southern boundary of the City and Borough of Juneau. While the City of Petersburg ceased to exist as a separate entity (the borough assembly created a service area to assume operation of the former city&#x27;s services), the tiny city of Kupreanof remains separate within the borough.

==Geography==
Petersburg is located on the north end of Mitkof Island, where the Wrangell Narrows meets Frederick Sound. Petersburg is halfway between Juneau, to the north, and Ketchikan, to the south.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (4.74%) is water.

Mitkof Island is largely covered by low mountains. The lowlands are mainly made up of muskeg, a type of soil made up of plants in various states of decomposition. It is approximately 20 miles from its north end to its south. The western side of the island borders the Wrangell Narrows, one of the six listed in Southeast Alaska. The Narrows provides a somewhat protected waterway for boats, and opens on the south end of the island into Sumner Straits. Mitkof Island has many creeks that empty into the Narrows, including Blind Slough, Falls Creek, Twin Creeks, and Spirit Creek.

According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the town is the 15th-most lucrative fisheries port in the United States by volume. In 2011, 101 million pounds of fish and shellfish passed through Petersburg, with a dockside value of $65 million. That year Petersburg ranked as 13th in the nation in terms of the value of its catches.

===Climate===
The climate of Petersburg is oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;), closely bordering a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;) and subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;). On January 16, 1981, Petersburg registered a daily maximum temperature of , the highest ever recorded in the month of January in Alaska. Eleven years later, on February 27, 1992, a high of was observed, also setting a monthly state record high.

==Demographics==

Petersburg first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census and incorporated that same year. In 2013, upon the creation of the Borough of Petersburg, it became a census-designated place (CDP).

==Economy==

===Commercial fishing===
For a brief time during a peak period of the commercial fishing industry, Petersburg was rumored to have the highest per-capita income for a working town in the U.S.

Commercial fishing is the dominant economic driver of Petersburg&#x27;s economy. The top producers harvest well over a million dollars of seafood each and every year. While there is a vibrant salmon troll and gillnet fleet, as well as participants in the dungeness crab and dive fisheries, the main producers in Petersburg are the 58-foot limit &#x27;seiners&#x27;. These 58-footers harvest salmon, halibut, black cod, king, tanner crab, and herring. Many of them travel west to trawl, longline and pot cod in the western Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea.

Currently making a comeback in the worldwide salmon markets, the 58-foot fleet now boasts crew jobs that can approach six figures. The sustainability of all commercially harvested resources has been a trademark of the fisheries participated in by Petersburg fishermen. Petersburg Vessel Owners Association, resurrected by Gordon Jensen in the 1980s, is the lead association that ensures that all seafood harvested by the Petersburg fleet is done so in a sustainable manner, consistent with the conservation principles embodied in the state of Alaska constitution.

Petersburg also maintains a large contingent of Bristol Bay fishermen. Over 75 Petersburg residents travel each summer to fish commercially on around 35 Bristol Bay vessels in Naknek, Dillingham and King Salmon.

===Tourism===
Small cruise-ships (up to 250 passengers) and private yachts visit from May through September.

Generally four days of festivities are planned, with the major events occurring early in the weekend. &quot;Little Norway&quot; celebrates May 17 with a longer and more enthusiastic celebration than any known Norwegian-American settlement or community. Recently Petersburg residents have traveled to Norway and have found that their American celebration of Norwegian Constitution day (Norwegian: &quot;grunnlovsdag&quot;) is longer than that in Norway, where they celebrate only on May 17.
* The Petersburg Marine Mammal Center is located here. It is a teaching center and supports research into new discoveries.
* Established in 1968, the &quot;Clausen Memorial Museum&quot; is dedicated to preserving the history, and telling the story of those who have lived and worked in Petersburg and the surrounding area.

Its Tlingit name is (&quot;Ḵaachx̱ans Little Lake&quot; with &quot;áa-kʼw&quot; &#x27;lake-diminutive&#x27;). The Tlingit people living in the Wrangell area, who were there centuries before Europeans, call themselves the after the nearby Stikine River. Alternately they use the autonym , where the meaning of is unknown.

The central (urban) part of Wrangell is located at , in the northwest corner of Wrangell Island. The borough also encompasses the entire eastern half of the former Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area, in addition to the area around Meyers Chuck, which was formerly in the Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area. It includes Thoms Place, a former census-designated place on Wrangell Island.

==History==
Tlingit people and their ancestors have inhabited this island for thousands of years. According to &quot;Naanyaa.aayí&quot; clan traditions, Tlingit people migrated down the Stikine River during a time when the river still flowed underneath glaciers. The population slowly moved down the river, settling in different locations such as &quot;Tlákw.aan&quot; &quot;Ancient Village&quot;, &quot;Sʼiknáx̱&quot; &quot;Across from the Grass&quot;, &quot;Shaal.aan&quot; &quot;Fish Trap Town&quot;, &quot;Xakw.aan&quot; &quot;Sandbar Village&quot;, and &quot;Kayáash&quot; &quot;Platform&quot;, Hehl (Xel/Xehl) &quot;Foam People&quot;, Hehl being the senior of house of the village.

Later settlements on the coast included &quot;Chʼuxʼáasʼaan&quot; &quot;Waterfall Town&quot; (now Mill Creek), &quot;Ḵeishangita.aan&quot; &quot;Red Alder Head Village&quot; (site of the Wrangell Institute at Shoemaker Bay), &quot;Kʼaatsʼḵu Noow&quot; &quot;Among the Sharps Fort&quot; (now Anita Bay), &quot;An.áan&quot; &quot;Village that Rests&quot; (now Anan Bear Viewing Area), and many others. The numerous petroglyphs found at Petroglyph Beach just north of Wrangell, as well as those scattered on the beaches of the many islands in the vicinity, attest to the long Tlingit presence.

It is known that the first peoples&#x27; coastal migration to the Stikine River came from the south. The Nass River people had several migrations into the area. The &quot;Git Setti&quot; people tell of their migration story in a totem raised in Wrangell in 1894 called &quot;Kickssetti&quot; Totem.

The saltwater inlet now known as Wrangell Harbor was traditionally called &quot;Ḵaachx̱ana.áakʼw&quot;, literally &quot;&quot;Ḵaachx̱án&quot;&#x27;s little lake&quot;. Before the harbor mouth was dredged and cleared in the late 19th century, the mouth of this inlet would often go dry at low tide, which led to its being called a lake.

&quot;Ḵaachx̱án&quot; was a man from the village variously known as &quot;Ḵaalchʼalʼaan&quot; (&quot;Kotzlitzan&quot;) or &quot;Chʼaalʼít.aan,&quot; meaning &quot;Willow House Village&quot;; or &quot;Shaax̱ít.aan&quot; meaning &quot;Driftwood House Village.&quot; The village site today is known as &quot;Old Town&quot; or &quot;Old Wrangell&quot; (located at ). &quot;Ḵaachx̱án&quot; was supposedly a hermit who preferred living away from his relatives, and thus lived in a smokehouse located on the rear shore of the lake named after him.

===19th century===
Wrangell was founded by Russians as one of the oldest non-Native settlements in Alaska. They started trading for furs with area Tlingit in 1811 at the site of present-day Wrangell. In 1834, Baron Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangel, then head of Russian government interests in Russian America, ordered a stockade built near the &quot;Naanyaa.aayí&quot; clan house of Chief Shakes, called &quot;Shéiksh Hídi&quot;. This house was located about north of Old Wrangell, on a small island in the middle of what is today Wrangell Harbor. The stockade, named Redoubt Saint Dionysius (&quot;Редутъ Санктъ Дионисіусъ&quot;), was founded at the location of present-day Wrangell and stood near the end of the small peninsula that forms the northeastern side of the mouth of the harbor.

The British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) leased the fort in 1839 and named the stockade Fort Stikine. The Tlingit had used the Stikine River as a trade route to the interior since ancient times, and they protested when the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company began to use their trade routes. Two epidemics of smallpox in 1836 and 1840 reduced the Tlingit population in the area by half, as they had no acquired immunity, and silenced most of the protest.

The HBC abandoned the fort in 1849 after the area&#x27;s stocks of sea otter and beaver were depleted, thus ending the fur trade. Fort Stikine remained under British rule until Alaska&#x27;s purchase by the United States in 1867. In 1868, the U.S. built a military post called Fort Wrangell at the site, and it remained active until 1877. The community around the post continued to grow through commerce with prospectors in the gold rushes of 1861, 1874–77, and 1897. As in Skagway, businessmen looking to make money off the miners built many gambling halls, dance halls, and bars. Thousands of miners traveled up the Stikine River into the Cassiar District of British Columbia during 1874, and again to the Klondike in 1897.
The Wrangell Bombardment occurred on December 25, 1869, when a Stikine Indian named Lowan bit off Mrs. Jaboc Muller&#x27;s third right finger and was killed in an ensuing fight by soldiers who mortally wounded an additional Stikine Indian. The following morning, Scutd-doo, who was the father of the deceased, entered the fort and shot the post trader&#x27;s partner Leon Smith fourteen times. Smith died about 13 hours later. The US army made an ultimatum demanding Sccutd-doo&#x27;s surrender, and following bombardment of the Stikine Indian village, the villagers handed Scutd-doo over to the military in the fort, where he was court-martialed and publicly hanged before the garrison and assembled natives on December 29, stating before he was hanged that he had acted in revenge against the occupants of the fort for the killing of Lowan and not against Smith in particular.

In 1877, the first Presbyterian church in Alaska, the first Protestant church of any kind in the area, was founded near its current location at 220 Church Street. Reverend S. Hall Young, a colleague of Sheldon Jackson, was assigned to the Wrangell mission and arrived on July 10, 1878. He worked among both miners and Tlingits. He established the Fort Wrangell Tlingit Industrial School to teach young Tlingit men various American trades, such as printing, boatbuilding, and construction. This institution was a parallel to Sheldon Jackson&#x27;s Sitka Industrial Training School, which became Sheldon Jackson College. Young&#x27;s school was the nucleus of the later Wrangell Institute, a boarding school for Alaska Natives through the mid-20th century.

S. Hall Young was a friend and companion of the naturalist John Muir, who lived in Wrangell in 1879–1880. Muir and Young traveled up the Stikine River, as well as to Kake, Glacier Bay, and elsewhere in Southeast Alaska. Young and Muir were accompanied by two Stikine elite men, &quot;Tʼaawyaat&quot; (&quot;Toyatte&quot;, lit. Long Feather), and &quot;Kaadaashaan&quot; (&quot;Kadachan&quot;), as well Sitka Charley, as a young man who was their interpreter in Chinook Jargon and English.

The oldest Catholic Church in Alaska; St. Rose of Lima, was established at Wrangell May 4, 1879.

Having been Tlingit territory and then under the jurisdiction of Russia, Great Britain, and the United States, Wrangell has the unique status as the only Alaskan city to have been governed under four &quot;flags&quot;.

===20th century===
Fish traps were constructed in the late 1890s on the nearby mouth of the Stikine River and in the Zimovia Strait. These contributed to the growth of the fishing and fish canning industries in Wrangell, which provided much of the economic life for the town before the rise of logging in the 1950s. The fish traps caused severe damage to the Stikine River salmon runs, reducing the number of fish that managed to spawn and causing a decline in salmon runs and fishing in the region. After statehood, the new government decommissioned all fish traps in Alaska. The fishing industry remained strong, and continues to be the primary occupation of many residents.

The weekly newspaper, &quot;The Wrangell Sentinel&quot; was founded in 1902 and printed its first issue on November 2 of the same year. The newspaper remains in publication with only a few short periods of inactivity. It is the oldest continuously published newspaper in Alaska.
The renowned Bear Totem Store, built in the 1920s by Walter Waters, housed innumerable examples of Tlingit arts and crafts, as well as a number of irreplaceable totem poles. Waters began his business career carrying mail by boat from Wrangell to Sulzer. During this period, he traveled throughout southeast Alaska as a fur buyer. While on business travels, Waters began to acquire Indian artifacts and make valuable contacts with Indian artisans. He eventually enabled him to open his curio shop, The Bear Totem Store. A severe fire in the early 1950s burned much of the downtown area, destroying the Bear Totem Store and most of its contents. Few historic buildings remained after the fire. The disaster dramatically changed the face of Wrangell, and with new buildings the past was lost.

Logging, fishing and tourism are the current mainstays of the Wrangell area economy. One of the last two major sawmills in Southeast Alaska is operated by the Silver Bay Logging Company just south of the city proper.

The community has always been a center of the Tlingit &quot;Kaach.àdi&quot;, &quot;Kiks.ádi&quot; and &quot;Naanyaa.aayí&quot; clans and the only home of the &quot;Kayaashkiditaan&quot;, &quot;Sʼiknax̱.ádi&quot;, &quot;X̱ookʼeidí&quot;, &quot;Kaasx̱ʼagweidí&quot;, and &quot;Taalḵweidí&quot; clans. Chief Shakes Tribal House, which is known in Tlingit as &quot;Shéiksh Hídi&quot; &quot;Shakes House&quot;, is a replica of traditional Tlingit houses. It was constructed by CCC crews in the 1930s of the Great Depression, according to traditional knowledge and methods. It stands at the original location of Shakes House, on Shakes Island inside Wrangell harbor. Today the Wrangell Cooperative Association, a Tlingit IRA council and the federally recognized tribe for the area, maintains Shakes Island and the House, as well as Totem Park near the city center.

===21st century===
In an election held on May 6, 2008, to decide whether to upgrade from city to borough status, 63.99% of the votes were in favor of borough status. On May 30, 2008, Wrangell was reincorporated as the City and Borough of Wrangell. Canadian American Donald McConachie Sr. was the first mayor of the CBW. He was succeeded by Jeremy M. Maxand, but was elected in 2012 as mayor again after Maxand declined to seek reelection.

The Wrangell Cooperative Association has commissioned a team to restore Chief Shakes House and the totems at Totem Park. It consists of a master carver, Wayne Price, and six assistants, four of them women, accepted after intensive training in the use of the traditional adze tool.

==Geography==

Wrangell is located on the northern tip of Wrangell Island, an island in the Alaska Panhandle. It is south of the Alaskan capital of Juneau. It is across the narrow Zimovia Strait from the mouth of the Stikine River on the Alaska mainland. The town is named after the island, which was named after Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangel, a Russian explorer and the administrator of the Russian-American Company from 1830 to 1835.

Per the 2010 United States Census, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and is water.
The former City of Wrangell, as of the 2000 census, had a total area of , of which was land and was water.

===Adjacent boroughs and census area===
* Petersburg Borough, Alaska
* Prince of Wales–Hyder Census Area, Alaska
* Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska
* Regional District of Kitimat–Stikine, British Columbia, Canada - east

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Wrangell has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;). Summers are mild and rainy with cool nights. Winters are moderately cold, though not very cold by Alaskan standards.

===National protected areas===
* Tongass National Forest (part)
** South Etolin Wilderness
** Stikine-LeConte Wilderness (part)

==Economy==
The primary industry of the city is fishing. A commercial fishing fleet is harbored in Wrangell and several sports fishing guiding services operate here as well taking tourists and wilderness adventurers to remote locations on the great Stikine River branching eastward into British Columbia. Boatyards have increased in scale allowing storage and repairs of larger vessels. The city has a picturesque golf course with a view of Mount Wrangell. Like many S.E. Alaskan communities state government spending is important to the local economy, though not to the extent of Juneau-the state capitol. The Federal government also kicks in a share with the forest service, postal service and homeland security operations expenditures.
The southernmost terminus of the vast Juneau Icefield is just north of the Stikine with several glaciers flowing down to the river and saltwater at LeConte Bay. Though the number of Chinook salmon has been devastated by commercial over-harvesting recently and the fishery was largely closed in spring 2018, hope for its recovery abounds since fisheries have crashed in S.E. Alaska recurrently over history and recovered.
Whales live seasonally in the waters of the Alexander Archipelago and visit Wrangell searching for herring and salmon creating good photo opportunities. The former vast Alaska Pulp Corporation logging operations at Wrangell closed down in the mid-1990s unable to meet water quality standards though cutting hundreds of millions of board feet of lumber annually. Wrangell has three marinas on the northwest side of the island and the southernmost; Shoemaker Bay, is undergoing renewal construction in September 2018.
A Tlingit cultural center and museum is located on the waterfront of Wrangell. In order to keep a small-town rural aesthetic, the city turned down the prospect of building a state prison and home-porting a naval vessel. The Stikine Inn was remodeled to fine shape, and an inter-island ferry business was established with service to Prince of Wales Island. Sunrise Aviation, an air work and tourism float plane service, continues to provide service anywhere in the region, though helicopter journeys to high mountain glaciers need to be scheduled from Ketchikan to the south 100 miles (Ketchikan is from the Tlingit word Kootchikan meaning place of stinky fish).

Baron Von Wrangell sent Lieutenant Dionysius Zarembo to establish a trading post on Stikine Strait in 1833 to beat the Brits. Tlingits apparently were receptive to British and Russian traders. 

Today nearby Zarembo Island has an elk and moose population visited by hunting guides and parties from Wrangell.

Alaska Airlines has twice daily service to Seattle as well as Juneau, Ketchikan, Sitka, and other southeastern destinations. The Alaska Marine Highway system has a terminal with a ferry dock near the Stikine Inn. In the back of a restaurant downtown there is a marijuana sales business. Wrangell&#x27;s seafood processing plant, though small and consuming much of the city&#x27;s water supply seasonally, employs workers from Mexico, Russia, and Somalia.

Wrangell has several churches and bars and a pizza store though no citywide free wireless internet for tourists or business travelers yet. The local Native Corporation—the Sealaska Corporation, contributes to the cost of local health care provisioning.

Bonnie Demerjian, Garrison Gibson, and other writers live in the city. It has guided kayak tours in summer and some of the most accessible coastal forest wilderness hiking, camping and climbing of S.E. Alaska. It is possible to follow the historic route in kayaks to the Stikine River Delta where the orphan warrior Chief Gush X&#x27;een and his band of Tlingits defeated boatloads of invading Nisga&#x27;a warriors from the south. Rather than becoming a slave the defeated Nisga&#x27;a Chief surrendered his hat and title of &quot;Shakes&quot; to Gush X&#x27;een.

The former mill site of the Alaska Pulp Corporation that was dismantled has some use sending logs and boulders via ships and a prospect for development as a cruise ship site with multipurpose western theme shops and dark ale brewery for export. The city has expanded its electrical power lines a mile and a half south on Isheyami Drive to allow a concrete production facility to power up (they bring in sand via barge from the Stikine River).

==Politics==
Voters in Wrangell lean strongly Republican, having elected a Democrat only once, in 1964. Wrangell has accurately reflected the choice of Alaska&#x27;s statewide presidential election winner in every election since the state&#x27;s admission to the union in 1960.







==Demographics==
Wrangell first appeared as an unincorporated village on the 1880 U.S. Census. There were 106 residents, of which 105 were White and 1 was Creole (Mixed Russian &amp; Native). In 1890, it counted 316 residents of which a majority, 228, were Native, 71 were White, 15 Creole, 1 Asian and 1 Other. That count included the Chantay farming settlement &amp; Labouchere Cannery.

In addition to the 1,162 residents, the census also reported a separate 163 individuals living in the unincorporated areas surrounding Wrangell. The combined number of 1,325 would&#x27;ve placed it just ahead of 7th place Petersburg (with 1,323 residents). Beginning in 1950, Wrangell fell out of the list of top 10 largest communities in Alaska. In 2008, Wrangell became a separate city &amp; borough.

* Wrangell High School

The Wrangell Institute was an American Indian boarding school opened in 1932, which closed in 1975.

==Health care==
The Wrangell Medical Center hospital is owned by the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium. The Wrangell Medical Center is a critical access hospital and long-term care facility with a total of 22 beds, 8 for acute care and 14 for long-term care. Emergency care, inpatient care, imaging, lab, and physical therapy are provided by the center. Visiting specialists in internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, optometry, pediatrics, ophthalmology, podiatry, orthopedics, rheumatology, dietetics and dermatology complement local services. SEARHC is currently constructing a new hospital that will be opened in 2021.

Alaska Island Community Services was established in Wrangell in 1989 under the original name Wrangell Community Services, and began providing Core Mental Health Services to the Community of Wrangell. Over the next two decades the delivery of services expanded to include Disability and Senior Services, rehabilitative wilderness experience for youth, Primary Care Health Care, Dental Services, and a Pharmacy Department. As a federally qualified health center, all of the services are provided on a sliding fee discount scale based on federal guidelines.

Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium is a non-profit medical, dental, vision and mental health organization serving the health interests of the residents of Southeast Alaska. In 2017 SEARHC merged with local non-profit Alaska Island Community Services to form AICS, a Division of Searhc.

==Post Office==
In 1943 the federal Treasury Section of Fine Arts commissioned artist Austin Mecklem and his wife, Marianne Greer Appel, to paint a mural, &quot;Old Town in Alaska&quot;, intended for the Wrangell post office. The work was completed at their studio in New York state, transported via railway on October 19, 1943, arrived in Wrangell in December 1943 and installed in early 1944.

===Radio===
Wrangell is served by two radio stations: KSTK broadcasts Public Radio format, and KWRG-LP has a Christian format.

==Transportation==

On Wrangell Island, Wrangell has two forms of transportation: ferry and airplane. The island offers a network of paved roads and miles of logging trails.

===Ferry===
The Alaska Marine Highway serves Wrangell on its Inside Passage route with regular northbound and southbound stops linking residents and visitors to the rest of Southeast Alaska.

Wrangell is also a stop on the summer Monday, Friday, Saturday runs of the Inter-Island Ferry Authority&#x27;s M/V &quot;Stikine&quot;. Its round-trip run originates in Coffman Cove on Prince of Wales Island, stops in Wrangell and Petersburg, then returns to Wrangell and continues to Ketchikan.

===Airport===

There are two daily scheduled Boeing 737-700/800 flights; passenger jet service is operated by Alaska Airlines at the Wrangell Airport. One plane arrives in the morning and one plane in the evening. Sunrise Aviation provides float plane service to the region.

===Roads===

The primary road is the Zimovia Highway along the west side of the island for 14 miles. Except for the highway and most roads in town, the rest are unpaved logging trails, forest service roads, and hiking trails. Isheyama Drive, which is on the east side south of the golf course, is paved for two miles. At the former terminus of the road is a view spot of Eastern Passage for pedestrians. Ballard&#x27;s, named for a fisherman, does not have safe small-boat landing. A logging road runs almost all the way through to Pat&#x27;s Creek road six miles south to bisect the island east–west to Shoemaker Bay, however a half-mile or less is incomplete according to one forest service timber harvest contract. The &quot;Reagan Road&quot; has been suggested as a name for the future street.

<text>Alatna (&quot;Alaasuq&quot; in Iñupiaq ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area of the Unorganized Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. The population was 35 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Alatna is at (66.548906, -152.844806) (Sec. 33, T021N, R024W, Fairbanks Meridian) in the Fairbanks Recording District.

Alatna is on the north bank of the Koyukuk River, southwest of its junction with the Alatna River, approximately northwest of Fairbanks and upriver from Hughes. Alatna lies just west of the municipal boundaries of the city of Allakaket.

The area experiences a cold, continental climate with extreme temperature differences. The average high temperature during July is 70 °F (21 °C). The average low during January is well below 0 °F (-18 °C), and extended periods of -40 °F/C are common. The highest temperature ever recorded was 94 °F (34 °C); the lowest, -75 °F (-59 °C). Average annual precipitation is 13 inches (33 cm) and average annual snowfall is 72 inches (183 cm). The Koyukuk River is ice-free from June through October.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has an area of , all of it land.

== Climate ==

==History and culture==
Several Alaska Native groups have lived in the area, including Koyukon Athabascans and Kobuk, Selawik, and Nunamiut from the north and northwest. The Koyukon lived in several camps throughout the year, moving as the seasons changed, following the wild game and fish. The various bands established joint settlements after 1851. The old site of Alatna was a trading center for Athabascans and Inuit. The first mission on the Koyukuk River, St. John&#x27;s-in-the-Wilderness Episcopal Mission, was established in 1906. A post office was opened in 1925. In 1938, the community&#x27;s name was changed to Allakaket (the old name for the mission), and the name Alatna was assumed by the small Eskimo community across the river. The first public school was established in 1957. A flood caused by ice jamming inundated 85% of the community in the Spring of 1964. In 1975, the community incorporated as a city, including both settlements of Allakaket and Alatna. A clinic and airport were built in 1978. A school and community roads were built in 1979. In September 1994, flood waters destroyed nearly all of the community&#x27;s buildings, homes, and food caches for the winter. Residents have rebuilt near the old city site, but Alatna is no longer within the incorporated city boundaries.

A federally recognized Alaskan village is in the community—the Alatna Village. The population of the community consists of 97.1% Alaska Native or part Native. The Alatna population consists largely of descendants of Kobuk Eskimos; Athabascans predominantly live in Allakaket. Subsistence activities are prevalent.

==Demographics==

=== Old Alatna (1920-1994) ===

The &quot;original&quot; Alatna first appeared as an unincorporated village on the 1920 census. At the time, it was located directly on the (north) west bank of the Yukon at , a 1/2 mile west across the river from neighboring village Allakaket. The population returns for 1930 combined Alatna and neighboring Allakaket, as the latter did not report a separate total. In 1940 and 1950, the population was exclusively for Alatna. It did not appear on the 1960 or 1970 census rolls. Allakaket incorporated in 1975 and included the village of Alatna within its boundaries on the 1980 census. Alatna, however, was designated as an ANVSA (Alaskan Native Village Statistical Area) on the 1980 census (within the city of Allakaket), with 30 residents (29 of which were Native American). It appeared again in 1990 as a native village (ANVSA), again within Allakaket. In 1994, flooding of the Yukon River forced residents to relocate to higher ground a mile to the west, leaving the city limits of Allakaket.

=== (New) Alatna CDP (1994-) ===

The post-1994 flood &quot;New&quot; Alatna village, located just outside of the boundaries of the city of Allakaket, was recognized and classified as a census designated place (CDP) in 2000.

At the 2000 census, there were 35 people, 12 households and 6 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 17 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup was 2.86% White, 94.29% Native American, and 2.86% from two or more races.

There were 12 households, of which 50.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 16.7% were married couples living together, 25.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.7% were non-families. 25.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.92 and the average family size was 3.43.

37.1% of the population were under the age of 18, 11.4% from 18 to 24, 25.7% from 25 to 44, 25.7% from 45 to 64. The median age was 26 years. For every 100 females, there were 84.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.0 males.

The median household income was $20,313 and the median family income was $52,500. Males had a median income of $22,500 and females $16,250. The per capita income was $14,109. There were no families and 9.1% of the population living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.

==Public services==
Alatna residents haul water and use honeybuckets or outhouses. None of the 12 occupied homes have plumbing. Major improvements are underway. A new water source, water treatment plant, washeteria and sewage lagoon have been built. There is an electrical intertie with Allakaket. Residents use the Allakaket clinic, washeteria, landfill and school. Electricity is provided by the Alaska Power and Telephone Company. There are no state operated schools in the community. Local hospitals or health clinics include Alatna Clinic (907-968-2314). Alatna Clinic is a Primary Health Care facility.

==Economy and transportation==
The economy is seasonal and subsistence-based. Salmon, whitefish, moose, bear, small game and berries provide most food sources. Caribou are taken when available. A few earn income from trapping or traditional Native handicrafts. Construction and BLM emergency firefighting also provide summer jobs.

Alatna has no road link, but winter trails connect it with Hughes, Bettles and Tanana. River transportation is important during the summer. A state-owned 3,500&#x27; lighted runway is accessible year-round in Allakaket. There is no barge service due to shallow water.

<text>Allakaket ( ) (&quot;Aalaa Kkaakk’et&quot; in Koyukon) is a second class city in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area of the Unorganized Borough of the U.S. state of Alaska. The population was 177 at the 2020 census.

==History and culture==

Several Native groups have lived in the area, including Koyukon Athabascans and Kobuk, Selawik, and Nunamiut Eskimos from the north and northwest. The Koyukon lived in several camps throughout the year, moving as the seasons changed, following the wild game and fish. The various bands established joint settlements after 1851. The old site of Alatna was a traditional trading center for Athabascans and Eskimos.

The first mission on the Koyukuk River, St. John&#x27;s-in-the-Wilderness Episcopal Mission, was established in 1906. A post office was opened in 1925. In 1938, the name of the community was changed to Allakaket (the old name for the mission), and the name Alatna was assumed by the small Eskimo community across the river. The first public school was established in 1957. A flood caused by ice jamming inundated 85% of the community in the Spring of 1964. In 1975, the community incorporated as a City, including both settlements of Allakaket and Alatna. A clinic and airport were built in 1978. A new school and community roads were built in 1979. In September 1994, flood waters destroyed and swept away nearly all of the community&#x27;s buildings, homes, and food caches for the winter. Residents rebuilt near the old City site, but some new homes and facilities are now located outside of the incorporated City boundaries. New Allakaket and Alatna are located outside of the City limits.

A federally recognized tribe is located in the community—the Allakaket Village. The population of the community consists of 95.9% Alaska Native or part Native. Allakaket is mainly an Athabascan community; Kobuk Eskimos live across the river in Alatna. Two separate village councils exist. Traditional potlatches, dances and foot races attract visitors from area villages. Subsistence activities provide the majority of food sources. The sale, importation and possession of alcohol are banned in the village.

==Geography==
Allakaket is located at (66.562610, -152.64756) (Sec. 14, T020N, R024W, Fairbanks Meridian.) Allakaket is located in the Fairbanks Recording District.

Allakaket is on the south bank of the Koyukuk River, southwest of its junction with the Alatna River, approximately northwest of Fairbanks and upriver from Hughes. The village of Alatna is located directly across the river.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (17.05%) is water.

The highest temperature ever recorded was and the lowest was . Average precipitation is and annual snowfall is . The Koyukuk River is ice-free from June through October.

==Demographics==

Allakaket first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated native village. In 1930, it and neighboring Alatna (1/2 mile west across the Yukon River) were combined (under Alatna&#x27;s name) for a total of 131 (given Alatna&#x27;s population was between 28 and 32 persons from 1920 to 1950, it can be estimated that Allakaket&#x27;s population was about 100 for that census). Allakaket formally incorporated in 1975, including the village of Alatna across the river. Following flooding in 1994, the residents of the Alatna portion on the western side of the Yukon River relocated to higher ground to the west, just outside of city boundaries. As a result, in 2000, Alatna was declared a new census-designated place (CDP), separate from the city of Allakaket.
As of the census of 2000, there were 97 people, 41 households, and 18 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 59 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 4.12% White, and 95.88% Native American.

There were 41 households, out of which 26.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.7% were married couples living together, 7.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 53.7% were non-families. 53.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 2.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.37 and the average family size was 3.68.

In the city, the age distribution of the population shows 23.7% under the age of 18, 19.6% from 18 to 24, 22.7% from 25 to 44, 25.8% from 45 to 64, and 8.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females, there were 142.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 155.2 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $16,563, and the median income for a family was $33,125. Males had a median income of $13,750 versus $35,417 for females. The per capita income for the city was $10,912. There were 11.8% of families and 12.9% of the population living below the poverty line, including 12.5% of under eighteens and none of those over 64.

==Public services==
Most public facilities were severely damaged in the 1994 Koyukuk River flood. Major components have been replaced—a new washeteria, well and treatment plant, water storage tank, sewage lagoon, and force main have recently been completed. The lagoon is connected to the washeteria and school. Residents carry treated water and haul honeybuckets or use pit privies; no households have plumbing. Infrastructure improvements to provide a flush/haul system are continuing. A new landfill and access road are also under construction. Electricity is provided by Alaska Power Company. There is one school located in the community, attended by 52 students. Local hospitals or health clinics include Allakaket Health Clinic (907-968-2248). Allakaket Health Clinic is a Primary Health Care facility. Allakaket is classified as an isolated village, it is found in EMS Region 1C in the Interior Region. Emergency Services have river and air access. Emergency service is provided by a health aide.

The Yukon–Koyukuk School District operates the Allakaket School.

==Economy and transportation==
Most cash jobs are part-time or seasonal. The primary year-round employers are the school, City, Tribe and village corporation store. Construction and BLM emergency firefighting provide summer jobs. A few earn income from trapping or selling traditional Native handicrafts. Subsistence is the focus of the local economy. Salmon, whitefish, moose, bear, small game and berries provide most food sources. Caribou are taken when available.

Allakaket has no road link, but winter trails connect it with Hughes, Bettles and Tanana. River transportation is important in summer, but there is no commercial barge access due to shallow water. The state-owned Allakaket Airport has a gravel runway and is accessible year-round. A $6 million airport improvement began construction in 1997. Arctic Circle Air Service, Servant Air, Warbelow&#x27;s Air Ventures, and Wright Air Service offer passenger flight service.

Allakaket does not impose taxes on real estate, or from other sources.

<text>Bettles ( in Koyukon; &quot;Atchiiniq&quot; in Iñupiaq) is a city in Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska, United States. It is near Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. The population was 23 at the 2020 census, up from 12 in 2010. It is the second smallest incorporated city in the state.

==History==
The original village was founded a mile southwest of the junction of the John &amp; Koyukuk Rivers in the late 1890s during the Alaska Gold Rush and was named for Gordon C. Bettles, a newspaper man, Montana Silver prospector, and trader who established the trading post and community in 1898. A post office was established in 1901 and continued intermittently until 1956. Residents began relocating east to Evansville, where the airstrip that serves the community today was built in World War II and is now used for commercial air service. The Hickel Highway was used to transport equipment and supplies to the North Slope for oil exploration, and to build the Dalton Highway, which is now used as a truck route to the oilfields. The old village was largely abandoned and the New Bettles was carved out of Evansville and was incorporated in 1985.

==Demographics==

===Old Bettles (1930–1960)===
The original village of Bettles first appeared on the 1930 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. At that time, it was located on the west bank of the Koyukuk River, a mile west of its junction with the John River . With the construction of the airfield at Evansville 5 miles east, residents began relocating away by the 1940s and the post office closed in 1956. The original village would later be known as &quot;Old Bettles.&quot; It would apparently last appear on the 1960 U.S. Census, although it is not entirely clear if the figures for 1950 and 1960 were for the settlement of the old village or for the new settlement around the airstrip in Evansville. It was reported the last residents left the old village in 1997, though several buildings still remained as of two decades later.

===New Bettles (1990–present)===
The present day city of &quot;New&quot; Bettles is about 5 miles east of the old settlement surrounding the Bettles Airstrip and was originally known as Evansville. It is located on the south bank of the Koyukuk River and east of where the John River flows into it. . Although the area began to be settled around World War II with the construction of the airfield, it was not entirely clear if the population figures for 1950 and 1960 were for the &quot;New&quot; Bettles or the old village, which still was occupied until 1997. When Bettles ceased to report after the 1960 census, the area around the airfield reported as the unincorporated village of Evansville on the 1970 census and as a census-designated place on the 1980 census. In 1985, a section of unincorporated Evansville was carved out and incorporated as the city of Bettles, and it has appeared on the U.S. Census again beginning in 1990.

Circle was established in 1893 when gold was discovered in Birch Creek; it served as an unloading point for supplies shipped up the Yukon River from the Bering Sea. The goods were sent overland to gold mining camps. In 1896, before the Klondike Gold Rush, Circle was the largest mining town on the Yukon River and had a population of 700. It had a store, a few dance halls, an opera house, a library, a school, a hospital, an American Episcopal church, a newspaper, a mill, and several federal officials: United States commissioner, marshal, customs inspector, tax collector and a postmaster.

Circle lost much of its population after gold discoveries in the Klondike in 1897, and Nome in 1899. A few miners stayed near Circle. Mining in the area has continued into the 21st century. Most of the residents of Circle today are Athabascan.

<text>Coldfoot is a census-designated place (CDP) in Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. The population was 34 at the 2020 census. It is said that the name was derived from travelers getting &quot;cold feet&quot; about making the 240-some-mile journey north to Deadhorse.

Coldfoot primarily serves as a truck stop on the Dalton Highway from Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay. North of Coldfoot, there are no services for 240 miles (400 km), until Deadhorse. It has a restaurant and a small number of overnight accommodations (converted pipeline construction camp quarters). Bus tours along the highway typically take two days, with passengers spending the night in Coldfoot. The BLM, USFWS, and NPS jointly staff a small visitor center during the summer. The Coldfoot truck stop was founded by Iditarod champion Dick Mackey, who started his operation by selling hamburgers out of a converted school bus. Truckers helped build the existing truck stop and cafe. The Alaska Department of Transportation &amp; Public Facilities (DOT&amp;PF) has a camp (maintenance station) in Coldfoot.

The town was originally a mining camp named Slate Creek, and around 1900 got its present name when prospectors going up the nearby Middle Fork Koyukuk River would get &quot;cold feet&quot; and turn around. In 1902, Coldfoot had two roadhouses, two stores, seven saloons, and a gambling house. A post office operated from 1902 to 1912, then reopened in 1984.

Coldfoot Airport, on the west side of the Dalton Highway, consists of a gravel strip, used for air taxi and general aviation.

Coldfoot has been featured on &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot;, a Canadian reality television series airing on the History Channel. The truck stop was first seen during the show&#x27;s third season.

<text>Flat is a census-designated place (CDP) in Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska, United States. As of the 2010 Census, the population of the CDP was 0, down from 4 residents in 2000. Its post office closed in January 2004. Few buildings are inhabitable with hundreds of collapsed ruins.

== History ==
Prospectors John Beaton and W.A. Dikeman discovered gold on Otter Creek on December 25, 1908. News of the discovery spread slowly, but some miners arrived in the summer of 1909 and built a small camp they called Flat City. More gold was discovered on nearby Flat Creek and more miners arrived in 1910. Beaton, Peter Miscovich, Lars Ostnes, and David Strandberg were prominent early arrivals who mined successfully long after the initial boomtown faded. By 1914, the community had grown to about 6,000 people, complete with an elementary school, a telephone system, two stores, a hotel, restaurant, pool hall, laundry and jail. However, a fire in 1924 caused the majority of the town to burn. By 1930, the population had declined to 124. No plat was filed for Flat, and the town site rests on mining claims, so the existence of Flat may contravene the law, but the U.S. Post Office acknowledged the community and served its few residents with an office until the year 2000.

Between 1986 and 2000, the primary year-round residents were a family of five who worked together to maintain the area in the winter for mining in the summer.

===Wiley Post 1933 airplane crash===
In July 1933, pioneering aviator Wiley Post undertook the first solo flight around the world. On July 20, en route to Fairbanks from a stop in Khabarovsk, Siberia, Post nosed over his high-wing, single-engine Lockheed Vega, the &quot;Winnie Mae&quot;, in Flat. Local residents helped him right the aircraft. The only damage was a broken propeller. A replacement propeller was brought to Flat by pioneer Alaska flier Joe Crosson and the airplane was repaired by John Miscovich. Post continued to Fairbanks, then on to Edmonton and New York, completing his solo flight around the world in under 8 days. 50 years later, Miscovich constructed a monument to commemorate Post&#x27;s first solo flight around the world.

== Geography ==

<text>Fort Yukon (&quot;Gwichyaa Zheh&quot; in Gwich&#x27;in) is a city in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska, straddling the Arctic Circle. The population, predominantly Gwich&#x27;in Alaska Natives, was 428 at the 2020 census, down from 595 in 2000.

Fort Yukon was the hometown of the late Alaska Congressman Don Young. Served by Fort Yukon Airport, it is also known for having the record highest temperature in Alaska.

==History==
This area north of the Arctic Circle was occupied for thousands of years by cultures of indigenous people and in historic times by the Gwich’in people. means &quot;House on the Flats&quot; in Gwichʼin.

What became the village of Fort Yukon developed from a trading post, Fort Yukon, established by Alexander Hunter Murray of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, on June 25, 1847. Murray drew numerous sketches of fur trade posts and of people and wrote the &quot;Journal of the Yukon, 1847–48&quot;, which gave valuable insight into the culture of the Gwich’in at the time. While the post was in Russian America, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company continued to trade there until the American traders expelled it in 1869, following the Alaska Purchase when the Alaska Commercial Company took over the post.

During the Klondike Gold Rush, in the winter of 1897–1898, Fort Yukon received two hundred prospectors from Dawson City, which was short of supply. A post office was established on July 12, 1898, with John Hawksly as its first postmaster. The settlement suffered over the following decades as a result of several infectious disease epidemics and a 1949 flood.

During the 1950s, the United States Air Force established a base and radar station at Fort Yukon; the town was officially incorporated in 1959. Since the late 20th century, due in part to its extreme northerly location and its proximity to Fairbanks, it has become a minor tourist destination.

On February 7, 1984, a Terrier Malemute-type sounding rocket, with a maximum altitude of , was launched from Fort Yukon.

==Geography==
Fort Yukon is located on the north bank of the Yukon River at its confluence with the Porcupine River, about northeast of Fairbanks.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Alaska occurred in Fort Yukon on June 27, 1915, when it reached . This was also the highest temperature recorded north of the Arctic Circle until June 20, 2020, when it was finally exceeded by a reading at Verkhoyansk, a location similarly known for its extremely continental climate.

Fort Yukon is also subject to severe winters, being less influenced by chinook winds than areas to the west—the winter season absolute maximum being colder than in Fairbanks. Until 1971, Fort Yukon held the all-time lowest temperature record for Alaska and the United States at on January 14, 1934, and it still holds the record for the lowest mean monthly temperature when the notoriously cold month of December 1917 had an average daily temperature of and the minimum averaged .

<text>Galena () (&quot;Notaalee Denh&quot; in Koyukon) is a city in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. At the 2020 census the population was 472, slightly up from 470 in 2010. Galena was established in 1918, and a military airfield was built adjacent to the city during World War II. The city was incorporated in 1971.

==History==

===Prehistory and early history===
The Koyukon Athabascans had seasonal camps in the area and moved as the wild game migrated. In the summer many families floated on rafts to the Yukon River to fish for salmon. There were 12 summer fish camps located on the Yukon River between the Koyukuk River and the Nowitna River. Galena was established in 1920 near an Athabascan fish camp called Henry&#x27;s Point. It became a supply and point for nearby lead ore mines that opened in 1918 and 1919, and from which Galena takes its name.

===Military air base===
In 1941 and 1942, during World War II, a military air field was built adjacent to the civilian airport, and the two facilities shared the runway and flight line facilities. This air field was designated Galena Air Force Station shortly after the split of the United States Air Force from the United States Army, which occurred as a result of the National Security Act of 1947. During the 1950s, the construction of additional military facilities at Galena and the nearby Campion Air Force Station, in support of Galena&#x27;s mission as a forward operating base under the auspices of the 5072nd Air Base Group, headquartered at Elmendorf Air Force Base, near Anchorage, provided improvements to the airport and the local infrastructure, causing economic growth for the area.

Following the end of the Cold War, in 1993, operation of Galena Air Force Station was turned over to a contractor, and all military personnel were withdrawn with only small groups of active personnel visiting the base on an as-needed basis. The former military facility remains in use effectively as a forward operating site that is used occasionally by the military. This use came under scrutiny by the Base Realignment and Closure Committee in the late 2000s and was officially closed October 1, 2010. The Air Force retains responsibility for toxin cleanup in the area and engineers from Eielson Air Force Base in Fairbanks still visit the site on occasion. The base is now totally controlled by the City of Galena, the Galena School District and the Alaska Department of Transportation. The Alaska Wing of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) was pursuing retaining one of the F-16 fighter hangars as a CAP facility for the CAP Wing in Galena, the &quot;Yukon Squadron&quot;.

===Modern era===

The City of Galena gained notoriety in 2011 when it was noted in media reports as being the US community which received the most benefits from lobbying efforts. The town evaded bankruptcy by aggressively lobbying for state and federal funds for the GILA boarding school in the town, which produced funds that turned the city&#x27;s finances around.

In May 2013, Galena suffered a catastrophic flood when the spring breakup on the Yukon River caused an ice jam approximately 20 miles downstream, backing up the river and affecting 90% of homes in the city. This flood was on a scale never seen before by Galena residents. In the part of town closest to the river, houses were submerged to the roofs in water, and properties on higher ground suffered damage as well. Most of the residents were able to evacuate in thanks to the efforts of the local airlines, volunteer missionary pilots, and the Alaska National Guard. Some of the residents chose to stay behind and took refuge in the few last remaining dry parts of town. The flood dike the Air Force built around both the runway and the GILA boarding school managed to keep the river from reaching them. Efforts were made to help Galena rebuild, with the assistance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and volunteer groups.

==Geography and climate==
Galena is located at (64.740643, -156.885462).

Galena is located on the north bank of the Yukon River, east of Nulato. The Innoko National Wildlife Refuge is southwest of Galena.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (25.41%) is water.

Galena is inaccessible by road to other parts of Alaska. Residents rely on river cargo in the brief summer season for the bulk of their needs, and planes, boats, or snowmachines to access the outside world.

Galena has a subarctic climate (Koppen Dfc), with short, mild summers and severely cold winters.

==Government and public safety==
The headquarters for the Koyukuk/Innoko/Nowitna National Wildlife Refuge is located in Galena.

The City of Galena is incorporated as a first-class city, governed by a city council. The city&#x27;s mayor is Edward Pitka Jr.

Galena is the seat of the Galena Village, also known as the Louden Tribal Council, a Federally Recognized Tribal Government. The Tribal Council is elected to represent the local Athabascan Native community. The current council&#x27;s tribal chief is Charlie Green.
The City of Galena operates a full-time police department. There is an Alaska State Troopers post in Galena with two troopers and a trooper-pilot.

Galena has a volunteer search and rescue squad, and a volunteer fire department.

==Education==
As Galena is incorporated as a first-class city and located in the Unorganized Borough, it is required by state law to operate its own schools, Galena City School District, apart from the Rural Education Attendance Areas which otherwise prevail outside of incorporated boroughs. Along with other such cities across Alaska, Galena&#x27;s school district operates a boarding school and a correspondence study program, to increase state funding which would not otherwise be available with the local pupil base.

Galena has three schools. Galena City School is primarily for local K–12 students. There is a public library located in the Sidney C. Huntington School. Sidney Huntington (1915–2015) was a longtime resident and leader in Galena and the author of &quot;Shadows on the Koyukuk&quot;, a popular book on Alaska.

The vocational Galena Interior Learning Academy (GILA) is a boarding school which draws students from around the state. GILA is located on the site of the former Galena Air Force Station and is one of three public boarding high schools in Alaska; the second in size behind Mount Edgecumbe High School in Sitka. The third is the Nenana Living School in Nenana. GILA uses the former barracks as a dorm, the former PX and headquarters buildings as class rooms and the dining hall as a cafeteria, along with the gym and other facilities. Recently, a new STEM building was constructed to replace one of the old air force buildings that had been used for classrooms. GILA provides educational and vocational training to young men and women from all over Alaska, grades 9–12, with most students coming from remote Native Alaskan villages from the Interior, North Slope and Aleutian Islands. GILA hosts various training and regional conferences throughout the year. GILA student enrollment grew from 110 to 180 in the 2009–10 school year.

Galena&#x27;s third school is Interior Distance Education of Alaska (IDEA), a statewide homeschool support program that serves 3,500 students across the state. As correspondence programs are tabulated by the Alaska Department of Education &amp; Early Development as a single school, IDEA is considered the largest school by enrollment in all of Alaska.

==Transportation, utilities and other facilities==
Galena&#x27;s Edward G. Pitka Sr. Airport (Code GAL) is the former Galena Air Force Station field and with a paved runway of over 8000 feet is the largest public, state-maintained airport in the Interior of Alaska. The control tower was demolished when the Air Force vacated the facility in 2007. The Airport is also the home of the &quot;Yukon Squadron&quot; of the AK Wing, Civil Air Patrol (CAP), which covers much of lp the interior region to the Bering Sea for Search and Rescue (SAR). A CAP Cessna-172 aircraft is stationed at Galena.

Heavy durable goods, such as oil, vehicles and building materials are transported by river barge in the summer.

The City of Galena, as a first-class city, operates various vital services such as water and sewer. The city also owns Nollner Health Clinic operated by Tanana Chiefs Conference, a Native health clinic that offers 24-hour emergency care and routine health care. Eye and dental services are provided to residents on a visiting provider basis. Medical emergencies are stabilized at Nollner Clinic and flown by air ambulance to Fairbanks or Anchorage. Dire pediatric emergencies are flown to Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital.

Public radio station KIYU-FM, based in Galena, serves the city.

===Energy===

Galena&#x27;s remote location, apart from Alaska&#x27;s urban transportation and utility distribution networks, means that the city must transport and store fuel oil in large-volume quantities. In 2004, the Galena City Council tentatively accepted a proposal from Toshiba Corporation to build the Galena Nuclear Power Plant, a small, self-contained nuclear power plant. In 2010, the plan was abandoned after local start-up costs to build a $27 million reactor core proved prohibitive for the community. The demonstration plant, the prototype for a line which Toshiba hoped to sell to similar communities in the U.S. and Canada, would have been the first civilian nuclear plant in Alaska; Fort Greely, Alaska,
had a small military SM-4 reactor until the early 1970s. There is currently an attempt at a movement towards solar power for Galena, which would reduce energy costs.

==Sports==
The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race goes through Galena (on even years), as does the Tesoro Iron Dog trans-Alaska snowmobile race. Galena is the halfway point of the Yukon 800, an annual summer speedboat race beginning in Fairbanks and taking place along the Tanana and Yukon Rivers.

Galena school sports include volleyball, cross-country running, basketball, swimming, skiing, and native youth Olympics (NYO).

The Galena high school boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; basketball teams were regional champions from 2004 to 2007. The boys&#x27; basketball team won the state championship in 2008.

==In popular culture==
Frostbite, a character from the G.I. Joe 3.5&quot; action figure toy line, is from Galena.

In the video game &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, Colonel Campbell announces to Solid Snake that two F-16 fighter jets have been dispatched from Galena as part of a diversionary tactic.

In the 1983 film &quot;WarGames&quot;, USAF General Beringer, played by Barry Corbin, scrambles two fighter jets from Galena, AK to intercept two invading radar indicated bombers. The bombers are a computer projection and once the fighters are within intercept range they disappear.

<doc id="105743" wikidata="Q79345" url="?curid=105743" title="Kaltag, Alaska">
<text>Kaltag (; ; ) is a city and village in Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 190, down from 230 in 2000.

== History ==
Kaltag was a Koyokon Athabascan area used as a cemetery for surrounding villages. It is located on an old portage trail which led west through the mountains to Unalakleet. The Athabascans had seasonal camps in the area and moved as the wild game migrated. There were 12 summer fish camps located on the Yukon River between the Koyukuk River and the Nowitna River.

Kaltag was named by Russians for a Koyokon man named Kaltaga.

There was a smallpox epidemic in 1839 that killed a large part of the population of the area.

After the Alaska Purchase, a United States military telegraph line was constructed along the north side of the Yukon River. A trading post opened around 1880, just before the gold rush of 1884–85. Steamboats on the Yukon, which supplied gold prospectors ran before and after 1900 with 46 boats in operation on the river in the peak year of 1900. A measles epidemic and food shortages during 1900 reduced the population of the area by one-third. The village Kaltag was established after the epidemic when survivors from three nearby villages moved to the area.

There was a minor gold rush in the area in the 1880s. In 1906, gold seekers left for Fairbanks or Nome; however, the Galena lead mines began operating in 1919. Kaltag was downriver from the mines and grew as a point on the transportation route for the mines. It declined in the 1940s as mining declined.

The old cemetery caved into the river around 1937. An airport and clinic were constructed during the 1960s.

Kaltag has a week long Stick Dance (memorial Potlatch) every two years that draws visitors from many neighboring villages. This Potlatch is sponsored by relatives of the recently deceased, in appreciation of those who helped during their time of mourning.

Much of the economy around Kaltag is based on subsistence hunting and fishing. Salmon, whitefish, moose, bear, waterfowl and berries are elements of the subsistence economy.

<text>Manley Hot Springs (&quot;Too Naaleł Denh &quot; in Koyukon) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2020 census the population was 169, up from 89 in 2010.

==Geography==
Manley Hot Springs is located at (65.007773, -150.626732).

Manley Hot Springs is located about north of the Tanana River on Hot Springs Slough, at the end of the Elliott Highway, west of Fairbanks.

The CDP has a total area of according to the United States Census Bureau. All of it is land.

==History==

Traditional lands of the Cosna Band of the Upper Koyukon Dene.
In 1902 a prospector, John Karshner, discovered several hot springs in the area. He began a homestead and vegetable farm. In the same year, the United States Army built a telegraph station. The area became a service and supply point for miners in the Tofty and Eureka mining districts. It was known as Baker&#x27;s Hot Springs, after nearby Baker Creek.

Farming and livestock operations in the area produced fresh meat, poultry, and produce for sale. In 1903, Sam&#x27;s Rooms and Meals, now called the Manley Roadhouse, opened. The Manley Roadhouse was owned by Robert E. Lee, who was also the town&#x27;s postmaster until his death in 2010. In 1907 a miner named Frank Manley built the Hot Springs Resort Hotel. The resort was a four-story building with 45 guest rooms, steam heat, electric lights, hot baths, a bar, a restaurant, a billiard room, a bowling alley, a barber shop, and an Olympic-size indoor swimming pool which used heated water from the hot springs. During the summer, the hotel&#x27;s private boat transported guests from steamers on the Tanana River. In the winter, an overland stagecoach trip from Fairbanks took two days. The town was renamed &quot;Hot Springs&quot;.

The resort and the mining in the area caused the town to prosper. It had a store, a newspaper, a bakery, clothing stores and other businesses. The population of the area in 1910 was more than 500. In 1913 the resort burned to the ground. Mining activity was also in decline and by 1920 only 29 residents lived in Hot Springs.

The town&#x27;s name was changed to Manley Hot Springs in 1957.

In May 1984, a newcomer to the town, Michael Silka, killed nine people in the area.

Since 1950, the population of Manley Hot Springs has slowly increased. In the 2020 census, the population of Manley Hot Springs was 169, up 90 percent from 89 in 2010 census.

<text>McGrath (&quot;Tochak’&quot; in Upper Kuskokwim, &quot;Digenegh&quot; in Deg Xinag) is a city and village on the Kuskokwim River in Alaska, United States. The population was 301 at the 2020 census. Despite its small population, the village is an important transportation and economic hub for the area.

== History ==

The Old Town McGrath site, across the river from present-day McGrath, was a meeting and trading place for Big River, Nikolai, Telida, and Lake Minchumina villagers.

In 1904, Abraham Appel established a trading post in Old Town. In 1906, gold was discovered in the Innoko District, and in 1907, and at . Since McGrath was the northernmost point on the Kuskokwim River accessible by large riverboats, it became a regional supply center. A town was established at the site of Old McGrath in 1907, and was named for Peter McGrath, a local United States Marshal. The Iditarod Trail also contributed to McGrath&#x27;s role as a supply center. From 1911 to 1920, hundreds of people walked and mushed over the trail on their way to the Ophir gold districts. Mining sharply declined after 1925.

After a major flood in 1933, some residents moved across the river. Changes in the course of the river eventually left the old site on a slough, making it useless as a river stop. In 1940, an airstrip was cleared, the United States Federal Aviation Administration built a communications complex, and a school was opened. McGrath became an important refueling stop for Lend-Lease equipment during World War II.

==Geography==

McGrath is located in Interior Alaska, 221 miles northwest of Anchorage and 269 miles southwest of Fairbanks. It is situated along the convergence of the Takotna River and the south bank of the Kuskokwim River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (10.48%) is water.

==Climate==
McGrath has a continental subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc).

<doc id="105749" wikidata="Q7187424" url="?curid=105749" title="Phosphagen">
<text>Phosphagens, also known as macroergic compounds, are high energy storage compounds, also known as high-energy phosphate compounds, chiefly found in muscular tissue in animals. They allow a high-energy phosphate pool to be maintained in a concentration range, which, if it all were adenosine triphosphate (ATP), would create problems due to the ATP-consuming reactions in these tissues. As muscle tissues can have sudden demands for much energy, these compounds can maintain a reserve of high-energy phosphates that can be used as needed, to provide the energy that could not be immediately supplied by glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. Phosphagens supply immediate but limited energy.

The actual biomolecule used as a phosphagen is dependent on the organism. The majority of animals use arginine as phosphagen; however, the phylum Chordata (i.e., animals with spinal cords) use creatine. Creatine phosphate (CP), or phosphocreatine (PCr), is made from ATP by the enzyme creatine kinase in a reversible reaction:

* Creatine + ATP creatine phosphate + ADP + (this reaction is -dependent)

However, annelids (segmented worms) use a set of unique phosphagens; for example, earthworms use the compound lombricine.

Phosphagens were discovered by Philip Eggleton and his wife Grace Eggleton.

== Reactions ==

The Phosphagen System (ATP-PCr) occurs in the cytosol (a gel-like substance) of the sarcoplasm of skeletal muscle, and in the myocyte&#x27;s cytosolic compartment of the cytoplasm of cardiac and smooth muscle.

During muscle contraction: 

: + ATP → + ADP + ( assisted, utilization of ATP for Muscle contraction by ATPase)
: + ADP + CP → ATP + Creatine ( assisted, catalyzed by creatine kinase, ATP is used again in the above reaction for continued muscle contraction)
:2 ADP → ATP + AMP (catalyzed by adenylate kinase/myokinase when CP is depleted, ATP is again used for muscle contraction)
Muscle at rest:
:ATP + Creatine → ADP + CP + ( assisted, catalyzed by creatine kinase)
:ADP + → ATP (during anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation)
When the Phosphagen System has been depleted of phosphocreatine (creatine phosphate), the resulting AMP produced from the adenylate kinase (myokinase) reaction is primarily regulated by the Purine Nucleotide Cycle.

<text>Minto (Tanana: &quot;Menhti&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the CDP is 150, down from 210 in 2010. The name is an anglicized version of the Lower Tanana Athabaskan name &quot;Menhti&quot; , meaning &#x27;among the lakes&#x27;. After repeated flooding the village was relocated to its present location in 1969. The former village site is now known as Old Minto.

==Geography==
Minto is an Athabaskan village located at the end of the Minto Spur Road, which comes off the Elliot Highway. It is located at (65.157885, −149.369916). The village is located on a bluff above the Tolovana River flats, which contain several lakes formed by the flow of the river through low-lying areas.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (2.58%) is water.

==Demographics==


Minto first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated native village. That village was located along the Tanana River, now known as Old Minto. It had a population of 55 in 1920, it did not report in 1930, 135 in 1940, 152 in 1950 and 161 in 1960. Following flooding of Old Minto, the new village assumed the name of &quot;Minto&quot; beginning with the 1970 U.S. Census. In 1980 it was made a census-designated place (CDP).

As of the census of 2000, there were 258 people, 74 households, and 54 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 99 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 7.75% White, 91.86% Native American, and 0.39% from two or more races.

There were 74 households, out of which 39.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 33.8% were married couples living together, 21.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.0% were non-families. 25.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.49 and the average family size was 4.15.

In the CDP, the age distribution of the population shows 38.8% under the age of 18, 11.6% from 18 to 24, 21.7% from 25 to 44, 18.2% from 45 to 64, and 9.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 25 years. For every 100 females, there were 113.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 129.0 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $21,250, and the median income for a family was $37,500. Males had a median income of $28,750 versus $28,125 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $9,639. About 18.2% of families and 26.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 25.0% of those under the age of eighteen and 12.5% of those 65 or over.

==Transportation==
Although a small community, it has a small landing strip called Minto Airport. It gives direct flights to Fairbanks. It is also served by the Old Minto Road, visible on Google Maps and on Google Earth imagery; it connects to the Elliot Highway, which itself runs between Fairbanks and Manley Hot Springs.

==History==

Minto is in the western part of traditional Tanana Athabaskan territory. During the late 1800s, some members of the nomadic Minto band traveled to Tanana, Rampart and Fort Yukon to trade furs for manufactured goods, tea and flour. After gold was discovered north of Fairbanks in 1902, steamboats began to travel on the Tanana River, bringing goods and people into the area. Old Minto, on the banks of the Tanana River, became a permanent settlement when some members of the Minto band built log cabins there. Other families lived there seasonally in tents. A school was established in 1937, but most families still did not live in Minto year-round until the 1950s. The people from the Minto band were eventually joined by families from Nenana, Toklat, Crossjacket and Chena.

Minto was relocated in 1969, due to repeated flooding and erosion. The present site is north of the old site. The new site had been used as a fall and winter camp since the early 1900s. New housing and a new school were completed by 1971.

The Old Minto Family Recovery Camp is a rustic treatment center operated by the Tanana Chiefs Conference relocated away from the old river edge village site. A residential program, it incorporates daily group and individual counseling for drug and alcohol addictions with traditional lifestyle activities and Athabascan cultural immersion. The old village site is used for seasonal celebrations including by the Cultural Heritage and Education Institute which provides curriculum elements in the school at New Minto.

==Notable residents==
Traditional Chief Peter John (1900-2003)

==Education==
The Yukon–Koyukuk School District operates the Minto School.

==Language==
The traditional language of Minto is Lower Tanana, one of eleven Athabaskan languages spoken in Alaska. As of 2010, &quot;Speakers who grew up with Lower Tanana as their first language can be found only in the 250-person village of Minto.&quot;

<text>Nenana (; is a home rule city in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area of the Unorganized Borough in Interior Alaska. Nenana developed as a Lower Tanana community at the confluence where the tributary Nenana River enters the Tanana. The population was 378 at the 2010 census, down from 402 in 2000.

Completed in 1923, the Mears Memorial Bridge was built over the Tanana River as part of the territory&#x27;s railroad project connecting Anchorage and Fairbanks.

==History and culture==

Nenana is in the westernmost portion of Tanana territory. (The Tanana are among the large Dené language family, also known as Athabascan.) The town was first known by European Americans as &quot;Tortella&quot;, a transliteration of the Indian word &quot;Toghotthele&quot;, which means &quot;mountain that parallels the river.&quot; It was later named for the river and the Nenana people who live nearby. The Nenana people became accustomed to contact with Europeans, due to trading journeys to the Village of Tanana, where Russians bartered Western goods for furs from 1838.

The United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. Early American explorers and traders, such as Henry Tureman Allen, Arthur Harper and Bates, first entered the Tanana Valley in 1874 and 1885.

In 1902, the discovery of gold in Fairbanks brought intense activity to the region. The next year, Jim Duke built a trading post/roadhouse to supply river travelers and trade with the Nenana community.

In 1905, the Episcopal Church, which had missionaries in Alaska, built the St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal mission and Tortella School a short distance upriver. The boarding school taught about 28 children of various ages at a time. Hudson Stuck, the Archdeacon of the Yukon, regularly visited the settlement, part of the 250,000 square-acre territory of the Interior he administered. Native children from other communities, such as Minto, also attended school in Nenana.

A post office opened in 1908. In 1915, construction of the Alaska Railroad brought new settlers, who doubled Nenana&#x27;s population. The railroad connected Nenana to the southern port city of Anchorage. The community incorporated as a city in 1921.

The Railroad Depot was completed in 1923. That year, United States President Warren Harding arrived to drive the final, golden spike at the north end of the Mears Memorial Bridge built over the Tanana River as part of the state&#x27;s railroad project.

This railroad truss bridge, the longest in the United States and its territories when completed, gave Nenana a rail transportation link north to Fairbanks and south to Seward, Alaska. The bridge still ranks as the longest span in Alaska and the third-longest truss bridge in the United States.

The construction had encouraged businesses and settlement in town. According to local records, 5,000 residents lived in Nenana by the early 1920s. After the railroad was completed, however, contractors and construction workers left the area. The city suffered an economic slump, and most of the residents migrated to seek work in other places. By 1930, the population had dropped to 291.

Nenana was the starting point for the 1925 serum run to Nome, after diphtheria antitoxin had been transported by rail from Anchorage. It was carried by dog sled to Nome to treat people in an epidemic.

In 1961, Clear Air Force Station was constructed 21 miles southwest. During this construction, many civilian contractors commuted from Nenana. A road was constructed south to Clear, but northbound vehicles had to be ferried across the Tanana River.

In 1967, the community was devastated by one of the largest floods ever recorded in the valley. In 1968, a $6 million bridge for vehicles was completed across the Tanana River, which gave the town a modern road link to Fairbanks and replaced the river ferry. The George Parks Highway was completed in 1971, providing a shorter, direct route to Anchorage.

The federally recognized tribe in the community is the Nenana Native Association, who traditionally spoke the Lower Tanana language. Under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, they have rights of self-government and managing some of their traditional territory. According to the 2000 Census, 41% of the city residents were Native American (or Alaska Natives).

Residents of Nenana sponsor the Nenana Ice Classic, a nature-based lottery. Entrants buy a ticket and pick a date in April or May and a time, to the closest minute, when they think the winter ice on the Tanana River will break up. This lottery began in 1917 among a group of surveyors working for the Alaska Railroad. They formed a betting pool as they waited for the river to open and boats to arrive with needed supplies.

The competition is run as follows: a large striped tripod is placed on the frozen Tanana River and connected to a clock. The winner is whoever comes closest to guessing the precise time when the ice beneath weakens to the point that the tripod moves and stops the clock. Interest in the pool has increased and attracts bettors statewide. This lottery has paid out nearly $10 million in prize money, with the winning pool in recent years being near $300,000.

In the summer of 2008, Nenana suffered heavy damage due to flooding. The Tanana River reached its second-highest level since written record keeping began.

The boat landing is used by hundreds of hunters and outdoor enthusiasts each year.

The railroad provides daily freight service. The Nenana Municipal Airport offers two landing areas: a lighted, asphalt runway 5,000 feet long by 100 feet wide, and an airstrip, turf, 2,520 feet long by 80 feet wide.

The Kokukuk River people massacred a large part of the population of Nulato on February 16, 1851, during the Athapaskan uprising.

After the Alaska Purchase, a United States military telegraph line was constructed along the north side of the Yukon River. The gold rush along the Yukon River that began in 1884 brought many new diseases to the area and many people died. Our Lady of Snows Roman Catholic mission and school were opened in 1887 and many people moved to Nulato to be near the school. A measles epidemic and food shortages during 1900 reduced the population of the area by one-third. 1900 was also the peak year for steamboat travel on the Yukon River, with 46 boats in operation. That summer, two boats per day stopped at Nulato to purchase firewood.

Gold prospectors left the Yukon River area for Fairbanks and Nome in 1906. Lead mining began around neighboring Galena in 1919.

<text>Ruby (Koyukon: &quot;Tl&#x27;aa&#x27;ologhe&quot;) is an incorporated town in central western Alaska, situated on the south bank of the Yukon River at the northwesternmost tip of the Nowitna National Wildlife Refuge. It is accessible only by boat or air. A formerly sizeable gold-mining and lumbering town servicing the region, at the 2010 census the population was just 166, with only a general store and post office remaining as businesses, down from 188 in 2000.

==History==


The town of Ruby was established in 1911 as the result of a gold rush. The amount of gold that is in the Fairbanks district is over 8 million troy ounces (250 tonnes) of gold, lodes have yielded over 4 million ounces. Gold was first discovered at the current townsite in 1906 on Ruby Creek. That discovery brought more prospectors to the area. In 1910 word leaked out about a gold strike on Long Creek, 30 miles south of Ruby, and a stampede was on. Discoveries on other nearby creeks followed and Ruby became the supply point for the mines.

At its peak the population was near 3,000, but by 1918 the town was in steep decline. Many of the men had left to fight in World War I, and several of the towns business people and their families were lost in the sinking of the Canadian passenger liner &quot;Sophia&quot;. A fire in 1929 destroyed much of the business district and a flood in 1931 took out what was left of buildings on the riverfront.

After World War II, Native Americans from near-by Kokrines relocated to Ruby to take advantage of the abandoned homes. There are currently fewer than 200 people living in Ruby.

<text>Tanana ( in Koyukon) is a city in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. At the 2010 census the population was 246, down from 308 in 2000. It was formerly known as &quot;Clachotin&quot;, adopted by Canadian French.

Jules Jetté (1864–1927), a Jesuit missionary who worked in the area and documented the language, recorded the Koyukon Athabascan name for the village as &quot;Hohudodetlaatl Denh&quot;, literally, ‘where the area has been chopped’. Several residents are chronicled in the 2012 Discovery Channel TV series &quot;Yukon Men.&quot; Almost 80% of the town&#x27;s population are Native Americans, traditionally Koyukon (Denaakk&#x27;e) speakers of the large Athabaskan (Dené) language family.
== History ==

Prior to arrival of colonizers in early 1860, the point of land at the confluence of the Tanana and Yukon Rivers (Nuchalawoyyet, spelled differently in historic accounts) was a traditional meeting and trading place used by members of several indigenous groups. There were as many as five different Athabascan languages spoken in the area in 1868 when the French-Canadian François Xavier Mercier established the first fur trading-post in the area. Noukelakayet Station, later known as Fort Adams, was located on the north bank of the Yukon, about 15 miles downstream from the mouth of the Tanana River.

Subsequently, an Anglican mission and several other trading posts were established nearby. In 1898 the U.S. Army, under the leadership of Capt. P.H. Ray, founded Ft. Gibbon at the present location of Tanana. Ft. Gibbon&#x27;s purpose was to oversee shipping and trading, maintain civil order, and install and take care of telegraph lines connecting to Nome and to Tanana Crossing, on the way to Valdez. All other Euro-American activities in the area near the Tanana-Yukon confluence moved upriver to accommodate Ft. Gibbon and the increased steamboat traffic caused by gold seekers. St. James Church moved to the present site of Tanana to serve the Euro-American population, and the Mission of Our Savior was constructed at the bottom of a hill opposite the confluence. The mission site became a center of activity for indigenous people in the area. Ft. Gibbon closed in 1923, but the town and mission remained.

In the 1930s a regional hospital was built in Tanana, and the Native Village of Tanana was officially chartered by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1939. The hospital served people throughout most of the rural northern regions of Alaska until 1982. During World War II Tanana&#x27;s airfield was one of the stops for aircraft en route to Russia as part of the Lend-Lease program. Postwar, a White Alice communications site was built on a hill nine miles behind Tanana, as a part of the Cold War Era&#x27;s Distant Early Warning system (DEW-Line). Also during the 1950s the mission closed and the indigenous families still living at the mission site moved down to the main town.

Tanana is served by the Ralph M. Calhoun Memorial Airport located at the Western edge of the city, 1 mile from the city center. The only airline that regularly flies to Tanana is Wright Air Service based in Fairbanks. Boat transport on the river is possible in summer. Tanana is served by a one-lane dirt road, which connects Tanana to the Elliott Highway in Manley Hot Springs. The road ends about 6 miles upstream from the town, but an ice road is constructed when the river freezes. The road opened in August 2016. The last twelve miles of road is private property owned by the village corporation Tozitna Limited. The parking lot at the river is reserved for residents, shareholders, and tribal members. Since 2020 a shareholder has been hired to monitor the parking lot.

<text>Venetie ( ; &quot;Vįįhtąįį&quot; in Gwich’in), is a census-designated place (CDP) in Yukon–Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska. At the 2010 census, the population was 166, down from 202 in 2000. It includes the Village of Venetie, a Gwich&#x27;in tribal entity designated in the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.

==History==
Gwich&#x27;in tribal leader John Fredson achieved federal recognition of the larger area of the Venetie Indian Reserve as Alaska Native territory in 1941, before Alaska was admitted to the union as a state. It was the largest reservation in Alaska, with approximately when established.

Under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, most reservations in Alaska were dissolved and the federal government made payments to tribes for considerable territory, designating areas as tribal lands. The Gwich&#x27;in tribal lands were reduced.

The people continued to adapt. In the early 1980s a &quot;unified Venetie/Arctic village tribal government formally codified traditional principles of caribou management into tribal law,&quot; an example of Alaska Native subsistence practices. Anthropologist Steve J. Langdon lauded this action as a way of combining traditional spirituality with secular law demonstrating &quot;the resiliency of the traditional cosmology and behavior and its ability to be flexibly incorporated into contemporary institutions and practice.&quot; A majority of the residents approved limits on the harvest of the Porcupine caribou herd.

In 1987 the Gwich&#x27;in tribal council tried to tax a non-native contractor building a school here, saying the council had the right as the government of tribal land. The case went to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which ruled in 1996 &quot;that the natives had the right to tax businesses on their land, about the size of Delaware, because it qualified as Indian Country, much like the reservations in the lower 48 states.&quot;

The state of Alaska appealed that decision, concerned that up to 44 million acres of tribal lands in Alaska might be classified as Indian Country and thus subject to local tribal taxation. (In the Lower 48, by comparison, about 56 million acres are designated as federally recognized, sovereign Indian reservation lands.)

In 1998, the case was heard by the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in &quot;Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government.&quot; It determined that the tribal council did not have taxing authority on its land, as the terms of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act had done away with almost all reservations in the state. Under that act, the federal government had made payment to the tribes for land claims and designated tribal lands for them. But, under the terms of the act, the tribal lands do not have the same sovereign status as federally recognized Indian reservations in the Lower 48.

<doc id="105767" wikidata="Q1029506" url="?curid=105767" title="Camilo Sesto">
<text>Camilo Blanes Cortés (16 September 1946 – 8 September 2019), known professionally as Camilo Sesto, was a Spanish singer, songwriter and music producer. There are various sales figures for him, ranging from 70 to 200 million records sold, and the singer himself claimed to have sold more than 175 million records. However, his official sales would represent more than 2.8 million copies worldwide, including nearly 900,000 certified.

== Biographical summary ==
Sesto sang in two pop bands during the 1960s and won a contest in a Madrid television show. He played a part in the Spanish filming of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Later, he teamed up with singer and producer Juan Pardo, but success would come on its own accord, with his own music works. 

As a composer, Sesto wrote songs for artists such as Ángela Carrasco, Miguel Bosé, Lucía Méndez, Charytín Goyco and José José, among others. He also produced and translated to Spanish the lyrics of an album by the popular Australian rock band Air Supply. Throughout his career, he remained one of the most influential pioneer artists of pop and rock in Spanish, that would inspire many newer acts in the Latin music world as well as across Europe, the Americas and Asia.

==Career==
The mid-sixties marked the beginning of Sesto&#x27;s career. After producing his first record with his band Los Dayson, in 1965 they traveled to Madrid to appear on Televisión Española&#x27;s &quot;Salto a la Fama&quot;. In 1966, Sesto joined another band, Los Botines, whose music was influenced by The Beatles. In 1967, the band appeared in the film &quot;Los chicos del Preu&quot;. At the beginning (1969) he participated in the chorus of the song &quot;O Tren&quot; by Andrés do Barro, produced by Juan Pardo. In 1970, he recorded various singles including: &quot;Llegará el Verano&quot; and &quot;Sin Dirección&quot;, with the artistic name &quot;Camilo Sexto&quot;. He became his own producer, as well as the producer of other artists. His solo career started in 1970, the same year he won the &quot;Revelación&quot; price, at the &quot;Olés de la Canción&quot; festival.

After meeting producer, Juan Pardo in 1972, he launched a solo career under the stage name Camilo Sesto. He appeared on Spanish TV&#x27;s program &quot;Buenas Noches&quot; singing &quot;Algo de Mí&quot; (his first No.1 record). &quot;Algo de Mi&quot; reached the Number 1 slot in Spain and most of the Spanish speaking world, and it maintained that top position for a whole year in most of Latin-America. In 1973, he represented Spain with the song &quot;Algo Más&quot; in the second edition of the OTI Festival, which was held in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte. In 1974, his success as a pop singer continued with record sales escalating rapidly. His concerts took him around the world with such songs as &quot;¿Quieres ser mi amante?&quot;, &quot;Llueve sobre mojado&quot;, &quot;Yo soy así&quot;, &quot;Isabel&quot;, &quot;Déjame participar en tu juego&quot; and &quot;Mienteme&quot;. &quot;¿Quieres ser mi amante?&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Recording in 1976. He has received several platinum certifications.

On 6 November 1975, Sesto starred in the role of Jesus on the Spanish version/adaptation by Jaime Azpilicueta of the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar at the Alcalá-Palace Theatre in Madrid (Spain). The production was very costly as he financed it entirely. His work was a success and received positive reviews. The public filled the theatre and shows were extended to four months. Both in terms of interpretation and musically speaking, Sesto&#x27;s show was considered of great quality. Andrew Lloyd Webber admitted that this was the only production that could equal the original American version.

After successfully starring in the Spanish version of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; catapulted him to superstardom, Sesto continued gaining fame as a singer and composer. Notable hits from Sesto include &quot;Vivir Así es Morir de Amor&quot;, &quot;Jamás&quot;, &quot;Perdóname&quot;, &quot;Melina&quot; (a song about Melina Mercouri), and &quot;Donde Estes, Con Quien Estes&quot;. Sesto went through a retirement in 1987 until he returned to the music scene in 1991. That year, he released &quot;A Voluntad del Cielo&quot; (&quot;Heaven Willing&quot;). The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Amor Mío, ¿Qué Me Has Hecho?&quot; (&quot;My love, what have you done to me?&quot;), reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart in the United States. The track was nominated for Pop Song of the Year at the Lo Nuestro Awards of 1992 and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers Latin Awards of 1993, respectively.

He survived a liver transplant in August 2001 and released an album, &quot;Alma&quot;, two years later. Sesto returned to the stage in 2004 at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival in Chile. Sesto won many awards at Viña del Mar in 2004. His last musical work was the singing of Bujalance&#x27;s football team&#x27;s hymn.

In 2008, Camilo announced his retirement from the studio, and in September 2009 he announced that he would go on a farewell tour. He would tour the Americas (United States, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, and other countries) for the next two years. In October 2010, he gave his last two concerts in Madrid, which were released as his first &quot;live&quot; (and also last) album. A live DVD called &quot;Todo de Mí&quot; recorded in Madrid, was released around the same time.
In 2011, he was awarded the &quot;Highest Hispanic Pride&quot; medal in Las Vegas, U.S. That day was proclaimed 28 may &quot;Camilo Sesto&#x27;s Day&quot; in Nevada.

==Controversies==
In 2011, there were rumours of another Sesto &quot;farewell tour&quot;, that some news media called &quot;La Gira del Adiós&quot; (&quot;The Farewell Tour&quot;). Allegedly, tour dates were made, radio stations spoke about it, tickets were sold, etc. There were many convincing ads in local newspapers, and magazines. However, Sesto later communicated that this was nothing but a &quot;hoax&quot; to get people to buy fake tickets for a tour that he himself was not even aware of. Many radio stations and music media threatened to take legal action against the singer if he would not &quot;meet with the responsibility&quot;, and Sesto was forced to once again come back into the media to try to clear his name. The courts ruled in favour of some institutions that eventually did sue.

==Death==
Sesto died on 8 September 2019 at a Madrid hospital from kidney failure, eight days shy of his 73rd birthday. He was due to release a new album on 13 September, as well as embark in a tour in the United States the following month. Spain&#x27;s acting Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez wrote on Twitter: &quot;Spain and all of Latin America mourn the loss of Camilo Sesto. His melodies will always be part of our memory.&quot;

==Legacy==
From the 1970s to 2000s Sesto created many hit songs, with almost everyone coming from his own inspiration, being the author, performer, composer, and producer of all his works. Camilo Sesto has the record of two presentations daily for 20 consecutive days at Madison Square Garden in the 1980s. 
And thousands of awards and recognitions among the most prominent:

He has also highlighted the importance of the prayer of the Our Father and has called for &quot;bread, justice, and forgiveness for all.&quot; In addition, during the presentation, the priest has delivered the singer of the Dove of Peace.

Most of Sesto&#x27;s works are in Spanish, but he has also recorded songs in English, Valencian, Italian, German, Japanese and Portuguese. Camilo has released at least one album in English. With a frenetic level of activity in the 1970s and 1980s, he remains one of the artists with the most number 1 hits (totaling 52). His albums had sold over 180 million copies by 2019. In 2017, Sesto was inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame.

<text>Diet Coke (also branded as Coca-Cola Light, Coca-Cola Diet or Coca-Cola Light Taste) is a sugar-free and low-calorie soft drink produced and distributed by the Coca-Cola Company. It contains artificial sweeteners instead of sugar. Unveiled on July 8, 1982, and introduced in the United States one month later, it was the first new brand since Coca-Cola&#x27;s creation in 1886 to use the Coca-Cola trademark, although Diet Coke is not listed as a Coca-Cola variant on the Coca-Cola Company’s website. The product quickly overtook the company&#x27;s existing diet cola, Tab, in sales.

== History ==

When diet colas first entered the market, beginning with Diet Rite in 1958, the Coca-Cola Company had a long-standing policy to use the Coca-Cola name only on its flagship cola, and so its diet cola was named Tab when it was released in 1963. Its rival Pepsi had no such qualms, and after the long-term success of its sugar-free Diet Pepsi (launched in 1964) became clear, Coca-Cola decided to launch a competing sugar-free brand under the Coca-Cola name that could be marketed more easily than Tab. Diet Coke was launched in 1982 and quickly overtook Tab in sales by a wide margin, though the older drink would remain on the market for decades until Coca-Cola discontinued Tab during the COVID-19 pandemic along with other of the company&#x27;s slower-selling drinks in 2020.

Diet Coke is not based on the Coca-Cola formula, but instead on Tab. The controversial New Coke, introduced in 1985, used a version of the Diet Coke recipe that contained high-fructose corn syrup and had a slightly different balance of ingredients. In 2005, the company introduced Coca-Cola Zero (renamed Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in 2017), a sugar-free formula more closely based on original Coca-Cola.

In 2005, under pressure from retailer Walmart (which was impressed with the over-the-counter popularity of Splenda sweetener), the company released a new formulation called &quot;Diet Coke sweetened with Splenda&quot;. Sucralose and acesulfame potassium replaced aspartame in this version. As the formulation was done to mollify one retailer, this variety had little advertising and promotion, as the company preferred to market Coca-Cola Zero instead. By late 2009, most distributors had stopped distributing the Splenda-formulated Diet Coke.
In 2018, in an effort to be more appealing to millennials, Diet Coke was packaged in a taller, more slender can (of the same volume) and introduced four new flavors. The cans reverted to the conventional shape a year later.

== Sales ==
Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi have capitalized on the markets of people who require low sugar regimens, such as diabetics and people concerned with calorie intake. In the UK, a 330 ml can of Diet Coke contains around 1.3 kilocalories (5 kJ) compared to 142 kilocalories (595 kJ) for a regular can of Coca-Cola.

== Sweeteners ==
Diet Coke in the U.S. was sweetened with aspartame, an artificial sweetener that became available in the United States in 1983. Early on, to reduce costs, this was blended with saccharin. After Diet Rite cola advertised its 100 percent use of aspartame, and the manufacturer of NutraSweet (then G. D. Searle &amp; Company) warned that the NutraSweet trademark would not be made available to a blend of sweeteners, Coca-Cola switched the formula to 100 percent aspartame. Diet Coke from fountain dispensers still contains some saccharin to extend shelf life.

According to the Coca-Cola Company, the sweetener blend is &quot;formulated for each country based on consumer preference&quot;. Cyclamates were banned in the U.S. in 1970; in countries where they are permitted Diet Coke or Coca-Cola Light may be sweetened with a blend containing aspartame, cyclamates, and acesulfame potassium.

== Health assessment ==

The most commonly distributed version of Diet Coke uses aspartame as a sweetener. As one of the most intensively scrutinized food additives, the safety of aspartame has been studied since its discovery. Aspartame has been deemed safe for human consumption by the regulatory agencies of many countries.

<text>The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a landmark which consists of 2,800 five-pointed terrazzo-and-brass stars embedded in the sidewalks along 15 blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and three blocks of Vine Street in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles. The stars, the first of which were permanently installed in 1960, are monuments to achievement in the entertainment industry, bearing the names of a mix of actors, musicians, producers, directors, theatrical/musical groups, fictional characters, and others.

The Walk of Fame is administered by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and maintained by the self-financing Hollywood Historic Trust. The Hollywood Chamber collects fees from chosen celebrities or their sponsors (currently $75,000) which fund the creation and installation of the star, as well as maintenance of the Walk of Fame. It is a popular tourist attraction, receiving an estimated 10million annual visitors in 2010.

==Description==
The Walk of Fame runs from east to west on Hollywood Boulevard, from Gower Street to the &quot;Hollywood and La Brea Gateway&quot; at La Brea Avenue in addition to a short segment on Marshfield Way that runs diagonally between Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea; and north to south on Vine Street between Yucca Street and Sunset Boulevard. According to a 2003 report by the market research firm NPO Plog Research, the Walk attracts about 10 million visitors annually—more than the Sunset Strip, the TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly Grauman&#x27;s), the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art combined—and has played an important role in making tourism the largest industry in Los Angeles County.

===Categorization===
, the Walk of Fame consists of 2,752 stars, which are spaced at intervals. The monuments are coral-pink terrazzo five-point stars rimmed with brass (not bronze, an oft-repeated inaccuracy) inlaid into a charcoal-colored terrazzo background. The name of the honoree is inlaid in brass block letters in the upper portion of each star. Below the inscription, in the lower half of the star field, a round inlaid brass emblem indicates the category within the entertainment industry of the honoree&#x27;s contributions. There are six fixed categories and honorees must fit into one of them. The six categories and their emblems are:

Of the stars on the Walk to date, 47% have been awarded in the motion pictures category, 24% in television, 17% in audio recording or music, 10% in radio, fewer than 2% in theater/live performance, and fewer than 1% in sports entertainment. According to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, approximately 30 new stars are added to the Walk each year.

===Star locations===

Stars of many particularly well-known celebrities are found in front of the TCL (formerly Grauman&#x27;s) Chinese Theatre. Oscar-winners&#x27; stars are usually placed near the Dolby Theatre, site of the annual Academy Awards presentations. Locations are occasionally chosen for ironic or humorous reasons: Mike Myers&#x27;s star lies in front of an adult store called the International Love Boutique, an association with his Austin Powers roles; Roger Moore&#x27;s star and Daniel Craig&#x27;s star are located at 7007 Hollywood Boulevard in recognition of their titular role in the James Bond 007 film series; Ed O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s star is located outside a shoe store in reference to his character&#x27;s occupation on the TV show &quot;Married ... with Children&quot;; and The Dead End Kids&#x27; star is located at 7080 Hollywood Boulevard, near the corner of LaBrea and Hollywood Boulevard.

Honorees may request a specific location for their star, although final decisions remain with the Chamber. Jay Leno, for example, requested a spot near the corner of Hollywood Blvd. and Highland Ave. because he was twice picked up at that location by police for vagrancy (though never actually charged) shortly after his arrival in Hollywood. George Carlin chose to have his star placed in front of the KDAY radio station near the corner of Sunset Blvd. and Vine St., where he first gained national recognition. Lin-Manuel Miranda chose a site in front of the Pantages Theatre where his musicals, &quot;In The Heights&quot; and &quot;Hamilton&quot;, played. Carol Burnett explained her choice in her 1986 memoir: While working as an usherette at the historic Warner Brothers Theatre (now the Hollywood Pacific Theatre) during the 1951 run of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;, she took it upon herself to advise a couple arriving during the final few minutes of a showing to wait for the next showing, to avoid seeing (and spoiling) the ending. The theater manager fired her on the spot for &quot;insubordination&quot; and humiliated her by stripping the epaulets from her uniform in the theater lobby. Twenty-six years later, at her request, Burnett&#x27;s star was placed at the corner of Hollywood and Wilcox—in front of the theater.

===Alternative star designs===
Special category stars recognize various contributions by corporate entities, service organizations, and special honorees, and display emblems unique to those honorees. Many special category stars honor people or organizations important to Los Angeles: former Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley&#x27;s star displays the seal of the city of Los Angeles; the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) star emblem is a replica of a Hollywood Division badge; the Los Angeles Times star displays the Los Angeles Times Building; and the star for the local KTLA television station depicts a satellite dish. Stars representing corporations, such as Victoria&#x27;s Secret and the Los Angeles Dodgers, display the honoree&#x27;s corporat letter e. Likewise, stars representing non-corporate entities, such as the Recording Academy and the Screen Actors Guild, also display the honoree&#x27;s logo. The &quot;Friends of the Walk of Fame&quot; monuments are charcoal terrazzo squares rimmed by miniature pink terrazzo stars displaying the then five standard category emblems, along with the sponsor&#x27;s corporate logo, with the sponsor&#x27;s name and contribution in inlaid brass block lettering. Special stars and Friends monuments are granted by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce or the Hollywood Historic Trust, but are not part of the Walk of Fame proper and are located nearby on private property.

The monuments for the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon are uniquely shaped: Four identical circular moons, each bearing the names of the three astronauts (Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., and Michael Collins), the date of the first Moon landing (&quot;7/20/69&quot;), and the words &quot;Apollo XI&quot;, are set on the four corners of the intersection of Hollywood and Vine.

==History==
===Origin===

The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce credits E.M. Stuart, its volunteer president in 1953, with the original idea for creating a Walk of Fame. Stuart reportedly proposed the Walk as a means to &quot;maintain the glory of a community whose name means glamour and excitement in the four corners of the world&quot;. Harry Sugarman, another Chamber member and president of the Hollywood Improvement Association, received credit in an independent account. A committee was formed to flesh out the idea, and an architectural firm was retained to develop specific proposals. By 1955, the basic concept and general design had been agreed upon, and plans were submitted to the Los Angeles City Council.

Multiple accounts exist for the origin of the star concept. According to one, the historic Hollywood Hotel, which stood for more than 50 years on Hollywood Boulevard at the site now occupied by the Ovation Hollywood complex and the Dolby (formerly Kodak) Theatre—displayed stars on its dining room ceiling above the tables favored by its most famous celebrity patrons, and that may have served as an early inspiration. By another account, the stars were &quot;inspired ... by Sugarman&#x27;s Tropics Restaurant drinks menu, which featured celebrity photos framed in gold stars&quot;.

In February 1956, a prototype was unveiled featuring a caricature of an example honoree (John Wayne, by some accounts) inside a blue star on a brown background. However, caricatures proved too expensive and difficult to execute in brass with the technology available at the time, and the brown and blue motif was vetoed by Charles E. Toberman, the legendary real estate developer known as &quot;Mr. Hollywood&quot;, because the colors clashed with a new building he was erecting on Hollywood Boulevard.

===Selection and construction===
By March 1956, the final design and coral-and-charcoal color scheme had been approved. Between the spring of 1956 and the fall of 1957, 1,558 honorees were selected by committees representing the four major branches of the entertainment industry at that time: motion pictures, television, audio recording, and radio. The committees met at the Brown Derby restaurant, and they included such prominent names as Cecil B. DeMille, Samuel Goldwyn, Jesse L. Lasky, Walt Disney, Hal Roach, Mack Sennett, and Walter Lantz.
A requirement stipulated by the original audio recording committee (and later rescinded) specified minimum sales of one million records or 250,000 albums for all music category nominees. The committee soon realized that many important recording artists would be excluded from the Walk by that requirement. As a result, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences was formed to create a separate award for the music industry, leading to the first Grammy Awards in 1959.

Construction of the Walk began in 1958, but two lawsuits delayed completion. The first lawsuit was filed by local property owners challenging the legality of the $1.25 million tax assessment (equivalent to $ million in ) levied upon them to pay for the Walk, along with new street lighting and trees. In October 1959, the assessment was ruled legal. The second lawsuit, filed by Charles Chaplin Jr., sought damages for the exclusion of his father, whose nomination had been withdrawn due to pressure from multiple quarters. Chaplin&#x27;s suit was dismissed in 1960, paving the way for completion of the project.

While Joanne Woodward is often singled out as the first person to receive a star on the Walk of Fame—possibly because she was the first to be photographed with it—the original stars were installed as a continuous project, with no individual ceremonies. Woodward&#x27;s name was one of eight drawn at random from the original 1,558 and inscribed on eight prototype stars that were built while litigation was holding up permanent construction. The eight prototypes were installed temporarily on the northwest corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue in August 1958 to generate publicity and to demonstrate how the Walk would eventually look. The other seven names were Olive Borden, Ronald Colman, Louise Fazenda, Preston Foster, Burt Lancaster, Edward Sedgwick, and Ernest Torrence. Official groundbreaking took place on February 8, 1960. On March 28, 1960, the first permanent star, director Stanley Kramer&#x27;s, was completed on the easternmost end of the new Walk near the intersection of Hollywood and Gower.

===Stagnation and revitalization===
Although the Walk was originally conceived in part to encourage redevelopment of Hollywood Boulevard, the 1960s and 1970s were periods of protracted urban decay in the Hollywood area as residents moved to nearby suburbs. After the initial installation of approximately 1,500 stars in 1960 and 1961, eight years passed without the addition of a new star. In 1962, the Los Angeles City Council passed an ordinance naming the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce &quot;the agent to advise the City&quot; about adding names to the Walk, and the Chamber, over the following six years, devised rules, procedures, and financing methods to do so.
In December 1968, Richard D. Zanuck was awarded the first star in eight years in a presentation ceremony hosted by Danny Thomas. In July 1978, the city of Los Angeles designated the Hollywood Walk of Fame a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.
Radio personality, television producer, and Chamber member Johnny Grant is generally credited with implementing the changes that resuscitated the Walk and established it as a significant tourist attraction. Beginning in 1968, Grant stimulated publicity and encouraged international press coverage by requiring that each recipient personally attend his or her star&#x27;s unveiling ceremony. Grant later recalled that &quot;it was tough to get people to come accept a star&quot; until the neighborhood finally began its recovery in the 1980s.

In 1980, Grant instituted a fee of $2,500 (), payable by the person or entity nominating the recipient, to fund the Walk of Fame&#x27;s upkeep and minimize further taxpayer burden. The fee has increased incrementally over time. By 2002, it had reached $15,000 (), and stood at $30,000 in 2012 (). , the fee was $75,000, about eight times the original amount adjusted for inflation.

Grant was himself awarded a star in 1980 for his television work. In 2002, he received a second star in the &quot;special&quot; category to acknowledge his pivotal role in improving and popularizing the Walk. He was also named chairman of the Selection Committee and Honorary Mayor of Hollywood (a ceremonial position previously held by Art Linkletter and Monty Hall, among others). He remained in both offices from 1980 until his death in 2008 and hosted the great majority of unveiling ceremonies during that period. His unique special-category star, with its emblem depicting a stylized &quot;Great Seal of the City of Hollywood&quot;, is located at the entrance to the Dolby Theatre adjacent to Johnny Grant Way.

===Expansion===
In 1984, a fifth category, Live Theatre, was added to acknowledge contributions from the live performance branch of the entertainment industry, and a second row of stars was created on each sidewalk to alternate with the existing stars.
In 1994, the Walk of Fame was extended one block to the west on Hollywood Boulevard, from Sycamore Avenue to North LaBrea Avenue (plus the short segment of Marshfield Way that connects Hollywood and La Brea), where it now ends at the silver &quot;Four Ladies of Hollywood&quot; gazebo and the special &quot;Walk of Fame&quot; star. At the same time, Sophia Loren was honored with the 2,000th star on the Walk.

During construction of tunnels for the Los Angeles subway system in 1996, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) removed and stored more than 300 stars. Controversy arose when the MTA proposed a money-saving measure of jackhammering the 3-by-3-foot terrazzo pads, preserving only the brass lettering, surrounds, and medallions, then pouring new terrazzo after the tunnels were completed; but the Cultural Heritage Commission ruled that the star pads were to be removed intact.

In 2023, a sixth category, Sports Entertainment, was added to acknowledge contributions of athletes to the entertainment industry.

===Restoration===

In 2008, a long-term restoration project began with an evaluation of all 2,365 stars on the Walk at the time, each receiving a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F. Honorees whose stars received F grades, indicating the most severe damage, were Joan Collins, Peter Frampton, Dick Van Patten, Paul Douglas, Andrew L. Stone, Willard Waterman, Richard Boleslavsky, Ellen Drew, Frank Crumit, and Bobby Sherwood. Fifty celebrities&#x27; stars received &quot;D&quot; grades. The damage ranged from minor cosmetic flaws caused by normal weathering to holes and fissures severe enough to constitute a walking hazard. Plans were made to repair or replace at least 778 stars at an estimated cost of over $4 million.

The restoration is a collaboration among the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and various Los Angeles city and county governmental offices, along with the MTA, which operates the Metro B Line that runs beneath the Walk, since earth movement due to the presence of the subway line is thought to be partly responsible for the damage.

To encourage supplemental funding for the project by corporate sponsors, the &quot;Friends of Walk of Fame&quot; program was inaugurated, with donors recognized through honorary plaques adjacent to the Walk of Fame in front of the Dolby Theatre. The program has received some criticism; Alana Semuels of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as &quot;just the latest corporate attempt to buy some good buzz&quot;, and quoted a brand strategist who said, &quot;I think Johnny Grant would roll over in his grave&quot;.

Los Angeles introduced the &quot;Heart of Hollywood Master Plan&quot;, which promotes the idea of closing Hollywood Boulevard to traffic and creating a pedestrian zone from La Brea Avenue to Highland Avenue, citing an increase in pedestrian traffic including tourism, weekly movie premieres and award shows closures, including ten days for the Academy Award ceremony at the Dolby Theatre. In June 2019, the city of Los Angeles commissioned Gensler Architects to provide a master plan for a $4 million renovation to improve and &quot;update the streetscape concept&quot; for the Walk of Fame. Los Angeles city councilmember Mitch O&#x27;Farrell released the draft master plan designed by Gensler and Studio-MLA in January 2020. It proposed widening the sidewalks, adding bike lanes, new landscaping, sidewalk dining, removing lanes of car traffic and street parking between the Pantages Theater (Gower Street) at the East and The Emerson Theatre (La Brea Avenue) at the west end of the boulevard. The approved phase one includes removing the parking lanes between Orange Drive and Gower Street, adding street furnishings with benches, tables and chairs with sidewalk widening. Phase two is in the schematic stage. Phase two is planned for 2024 and will include closing down the boulevard to two lanes, adding landscaping with shade trees and five public plazas made up of art deco designed street pavers and kiosks. Planned to be completed by 2026, funding is being raised for the $50 million project.

==Nomination process==
Each year an average of 200 nominations are submitted to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce Walk of Fame selection committee. Anyone, including fans, can nominate anyone active in the field of entertainment as long as the nominee or their management approves the nomination. Nominees must have a minimum of five years&#x27; experience in the category for which they are nominated and a history of &quot;charitable contributions&quot;. Posthumous nominees must have been deceased at least five years. At a meeting each June, the committee selects approximately 20 to 24 celebrities to receive stars on the Walk of Fame. One posthumous award is given each year as well. The nominations of those not selected are rolled over to the following year for reconsideration; those not selected two years in a row are dropped, and must be renominated to receive further consideration. Living recipients must agree to personally attend a presentation ceremony within two years of selection. If the ceremony is not scheduled within two years, a new application must be submitted. A relative of deceased recipients must attend posthumous presentations. Presentation ceremonies are open to the public.

A fee of $75,000 (), payable at time of selection, is collected to pay for the creation and installation of the star, as well as general maintenance of the Walk of Fame. The fee is usually paid by the nominating organization, which may be a film studio, record company, broadcaster, or other sponsor involved with the prospective honoree. The Starz cable network, for example, paid for Dennis Hopper&#x27;s star as part of the promotion for its series &quot;Crash&quot;.

Traditionally, the identities of selection committee members, other than its chairman, have not been made public in order to minimize conflicts of interest and to discourage lobbying by celebrities and their representatives (a significant problem during the original selections in the late 1950s). However, in 1999, in response to intensifying charges of secrecy in the selection process, the Chamber disclosed the members&#x27; names: Johnny Grant, the longtime chair and representative of the television category; Earl Lestz, president of Paramount Studio Group (motion pictures); Stan Spero, retired manager with broadcast stations KMPC and KABC (radio); Kate Nelson, owner of the Palace Theatre (live performance); and Mary Lou Dudas, vice president of A&amp;M Records (recording industry). Since that 1999 announcement, the chamber has revealed only that Lestz (who received his own star in 2004) became chairman after Grant died in 2008. Their current official position is that &quot;each of the five categories is represented by someone with expertise in that field&quot;.

In 2010, Lestz was replaced as chairman by John Pavlik, former Director of Communications for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. While no public announcement was made to that effect, he was identified as chairman in the Chamber&#x27;s press release announcing the 2011 star recipients. In 2016, the chair, according to the Chamber&#x27;s 2016 selection announcement, was film producer Maureen Schultz. In 2023, the selection committee chair was radio personality Ellen K.

===Rule adjustments===
Walk of Fame rules prohibit consideration of nominees whose contributions fall outside the six major entertainment categories, but the selection committee has been known to adjust interpretations of its rules to justify a selection. The Walk&#x27;s four round Moon landing monuments at the corners of Hollywood and Vine, for example, officially recognize the Apollo 11 astronauts for &quot;contributions to the television industry.&quot; Johnny Grant acknowledged, in 2005, that classifying the first Moon landing as a television entertainment event was &quot;a bit of a stretch&quot;. Magic Johnson was added to the motion picture category based on his ownership of the Magic Johnson Theatre chain, citing as precedent Sid Grauman, builder of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre.

Muhammad Ali&#x27;s star was granted after the committee decided that boxing could be considered a form of &quot;live performance&quot;. Its placement on a wall of the Dolby Theatre makes it the only star mounted on a vertical surface, acceding to Ali&#x27;s request that his name not be walked upon, as he shared his name with the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

All living honorees have been required since 1968 to personally attend their star&#x27;s unveiling, and approximately 40 have declined the honor due to this condition. The only recipient to date who failed to appear after agreeing to do so was Barbra Streisand, in 1976. Her star was unveiled anyway, near the intersection of Hollywood and Highland. Streisand did attend when her husband, James Brolin, unveiled his star in 1998 two blocks to the east.

==Entertainers on the Walk of Fame==

===Entertainers with multiple stars===
The following notable entertainers have had their contributions in multiple categories recognized with multiple stars.

====Five====
Gene Autry is the only honoree to have a star in every category during 1983–2023, when the number of categories was five.

====Four====
Bob Hope, Mickey Rooney, Roy Rogers, and Tony Martin each have stars in four categories; Rooney has three of his own and a fourth with his eighth wife, Jan Chamberlin, while Rogers also has three of his own, and a fourth with his band, Sons of the Pioneers.

====Three====
Thirty-three honorees, including Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Jo Stafford, Dean Martin, Dinah Shore, Gale Storm, Danny Kaye, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and Jack Benny have stars in three categories.

====Two====
Over a dozen have two stars:
*Dolly Parton, for her solo work and part of the trio made up of her, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt.
*Michael Jackson, as a soloist and as a member of The Jacksons.
*Diana Ross, as a member of The Supremes and for her solo work. 
*Smokey Robinson, as a solo artist and as a member of The Miracles. 
*John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr as individuals and as members of The Beatles. 
*George Eastman is the only honoree with two stars in the same category for the same achievement, the invention of roll film.
*Walt Disney, has stars in two different categories for his work in both film and television; in addition, Mickey Mouse (who was originally voiced by Walt Disney) and Disneyland have stars.
*Kermit the Frog, has an individual star for television and as a member of The Muppets for film.
*Aleksa Anđelković, has a single star for comedy and as a member of the Boneheads band.
* Bette Davis, Alfred Hitchcock, Paul Henreid, Jane Wyman, Loretta Young, and Vincent Price all have one star each for film and television.
* Doris Day and Judy Garland both have one star each for film and recording.
* Jean Hersholt and Hattie McDaniel both have one star each for film and radio.
* Arlene Francis and Cass Daley both have one star each for television and radio.
Cher forfeited her opportunity to join this list by declining to schedule the mandatory personal appearance when she was selected in 1983. She did, however, attend the unveiling of the Sonny &amp; Cher star in 1998, as a tribute to her recently deceased ex-husband, Sonny Bono.

==Unique and unusual==
Sixteen stars are identified with a one-word stage name (e.g., Liberace, Pink, Roseanne, and Slash). Clayton Moore is so inextricably linked with his Lone Ranger character, even though he played other roles during his career, that he is one of only two actors to have his character&#x27;s name alongside his own on his star. The other is Tommy Riggs, whose star references his Betty Lou character. The largest group of individuals represented by a single star is the estimated 122 adults and 12 children collectively known as the Munchkins, from the landmark 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

Two pairs of stars share identical names representing different people. There are two Harrison Ford stars, honoring the silent film actor (at 6665 Hollywood Boulevard), and the present-day actor (in front of the Dolby Theatre at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard). Two Michael Jackson stars represent the pop singer (at 6927 Hollywood Boulevard), and the radio personality (at 1597 Vine Street).

The Westmores received the first star honoring contributions in theatrical make-up. Other make-up artists on the walk are Max Factor, John Chambers and Rick Baker. Three stars recognize experts in special effects: Ray Harryhausen, Dennis Muren, and Stan Winston. Only two costume designers have received a star: eight-time Academy Award Winner Edith Head, and the first African-American to win an Oscar for costume design, Ruth E. Carter.

Sidney Sheldon is one of two novelists with a star, which he earned for writing screenplays for such films as &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot; (1947) before becoming a novelist. The other is Ray Bradbury, whose books and stories have formed the basis of dozens of movies and television programs over a nearly 60-year period.

Nine inventors have stars on the Walk: George Eastman, inventor of roll film; Thomas Edison, inventor of the first true film projector and holder of numerous patents related to motion-picture technology; Lee de Forest, inventor of the triode vacuum tube, which played an important role in the development of radio and television broadcasts, and Phonofilm, which made sound films possible; Herbert Kalmus, inventor of Technicolor; Auguste and Louis Lumière, inventors of important components of the motion picture camera; Mark Serrurier, inventor of the technology used for film editing; Hedy Lamarr, co-inventor of a frequency-hopping radio guidance system that was a precursor to Wi-Fi networks and cellular telephone systems; and Ray Dolby, co-developer of the first video tape recorder and inventor of the Dolby noise-reduction system.

A few star recipients moved on after their entertainment careers to political notability. Two Presidents of the United States, Ronald Reagan (40th President) and Donald Trump (45th, and 47th President), have stars on the Walk. Reagan is also one of two Governors of California with a star; the other is Arnold Schwarzenegger. One U.S. senator (George Murphy) and two members of the U.S. House of Representatives (Helen Gahagan and Sonny Bono) have stars. Ignacy Paderewski, who served as Prime Minister of Poland between the World Wars, is the only European head of government represented. Film and stage actor Albert Dekker served one term in the California State Assembly during the 1940s.

On its 50th anniversary in 2005, Disneyland received a star near Disney&#x27;s Soda Fountain on Hollywood Boulevard. Stars for commercial organizations are only considered for those with a Hollywood show business connection of at least 50 years&#x27; duration. While not technically part of the Walk itself (a city ordinance prohibits placing corporate names on sidewalks), the star was installed adjacent to it.

There are four dogs represented on the walk, Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, Strongheart, and Snoopy.

Charlie Chaplin is the only honoree to be selected twice for the same star on the Walk. He was unanimously voted into the initial group of 500 in 1956, but the Selection Committee ultimately excluded him, ostensibly due to questions regarding his morals (he had been charged with violating the Mann Act—and exonerated—during the White Slavery hysteria of the 1940s), but more likely due to his left-leaning political views. The rebuke prompted an unsuccessful lawsuit by his son, Charles Chaplin Jr. Chaplin&#x27;s star was finally added to the Walk in 1972, the same year he received his Academy Award. Even then, 16 years later, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce received angry letters from across the country protesting its decision to include him.

The committee&#x27;s Chaplin difficulties reportedly contributed to its decision in 1978 against awarding a star to Paul Robeson, the controversial opera singer, actor, athlete, writer, lawyer, and social activist. The resulting outcry from the entertainment industry, civic circles, local and national politicians, and many other quarters was so intense that the decision was reversed and Robeson was awarded a star in 1979.

===Fictional characters===


In 1978, in honor of his 50th anniversary, Mickey Mouse became the first animated character to receive a star, and nearly twenty more followed over the next decades. Other fictional characters on the Walk include the Munchkins, the &quot;kaiju&quot; Godzilla, the live-action dog named Lassie, Pee-Wee Herman as portrayed by Paul Reubens, animated film characters such as Shrek and Snow White, and animated television characters including the Simpsons and the Rugrats.

Jim Henson is one of four puppeteers to have a star, but also has a further three stars dedicated to his creations: one for The Muppets as a whole, one for Kermit the Frog and one for Big Bird.

===Errors===
In 2010, Julia Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s star was constructed with the name &quot;Julia Luis Dreyfus&quot;. The actress was reportedly amused, and the error was corrected. A similar mistake was made on Dick Van Dyke&#x27;s star in 1993 (&quot;Vandyke&quot;), and rectified. Film and television actor Don Haggerty&#x27;s star originally displayed the first name &quot;Dan&quot;. The mistake was fixed, but years later the television actor Dan Haggerty (of &quot;Grizzly Adams&quot; fame, no relation to Don) also received a star. The confusion eventually sprouted an urban legend that Dan Haggerty was the only honoree to have a star removed from the Walk of Fame. For 28 years, the star intended to honor Mauritz Stiller, the Helsinki-born pioneer of Swedish film who brought Greta Garbo to the United States, read &quot;Maurice Diller&quot;, possibly due to mistranscription of verbal dictation. The star was finally remade with the correct name in 1988.

Four stars remain misspelled: the opera star Lotte Lehmann (spelled &quot;Lottie&quot;); &quot;King Kong&quot; creator, director, and producer and Cinerama pioneer Merian C. Cooper (&quot;Meriam&quot;); cinematography pioneer Auguste Lumière (&quot;August&quot;); and radio comedienne Mary Livingstone (&quot;Livingston&quot;).

Monty Woolley, the veteran film and stage actor best known for &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1942) and the line &quot;Time flies when you&#x27;re having fun&quot;, is officially listed in the motion picture category, but his star on the Walk of Fame bears the television emblem. Woolley did appear on the small screen late in his career, but his TV contributions were eclipsed by his extensive stage, film, and radio work. Similarly, the star of film actress Carmen Miranda bears the TV emblem, although her official category is motion pictures. Radio and television talk show host Larry King is officially a television honoree, but his star displays a film camera.

==Theft and vandalism==
Acts of vandalism on the Walk of Fame have ranged from profanity and political statements written on stars with markers and paint to damage with heavy tools. Vandals have also tried to chisel out the brass category emblems embedded in the stars below the names, and have even stolen a statue component of &quot;The Four Ladies of Hollywood&quot;. Closed circuit surveillance cameras have been installed on the stretch of Hollywood Boulevard between La Brea Avenue and Vine Street in an effort to discourage mischievous activities.

Four of the stars, which weigh about each, have been stolen from the Walk of Fame. In 2000, James Stewart&#x27;s and Kirk Douglas&#x27; stars disappeared from their locations near the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, where they had been temporarily removed for a construction project. Police recovered them in the suburban community of South Gate when they arrested a man involved in an incident there and searched his house. The suspect was a construction worker employed on the Hollywood and Vine project. The stars had been badly damaged and had to be remade. One of Gene Autry&#x27;s five stars was also stolen from a construction area. Another theft occurred in 2005 when thieves used a concrete saw to remove Gregory Peck&#x27;s star from its Hollywood Boulevard site at the intersection of North El Centro Avenue, near North Gower. The star was replaced almost immediately, but the original was never recovered and the perpetrators never caught.

Donald Trump&#x27;s star, obtained for his work as owner and producer of the Miss Universe pageant, has been vandalized multiple times. During the 2016 presidential election, a man named James Otis, who claims to be an heir to the Otis Elevator Company fortune, used a sledgehammer and a pickaxe to destroy all of the star&#x27;s brass inlays. He readily admitted to the vandalism and was arrested and sentenced to three years&#x27; probation. The star was repaired and served as a site of pro-Trump demonstrations until it was destroyed a second time in July 2018 by a man named Austin Clay. Clay later surrendered himself to the police and was bailed out by James Otis. Clay was sentenced to one day in jail, three years of probation, and 20 days of community service. He also was ordered to attend psychological counseling and pay restitution of $9,404.46 to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. On December 18, 2018, the star was defaced with swastikas and other graffiti drawn in permanent marker, and it was again vandalized with a pickaxe on October 2, 2020.

In August 2018, the West Hollywood City Council unanimously passed a resolution requesting permanent removal of the star due to repeated vandalism, according to Mayor John Duran. The resolution was completely symbolic, as West Hollywood has no jurisdiction over the Walk. Activist groups have also called for the removal of stars honoring individuals whose public and professional lives have become controversial, including Trump, Bill Cosby, Kevin Spacey, and Brett Ratner. In answer to these campaigns, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced that because the Walk is a historical landmark, &quot;once a star has been added ... it is considered a part of the historic fabric of the Hollywood Walk of Fame&quot; and cannot be removed.

==&quot;Hollywood and La Brea Gateway&quot;==

The &quot;Hollywood and La Brea Gateway&quot; is a 1993 cast stainless steel public art installation by architect Catherine Hardwicke. The sculpture, popularly known as &quot;The Four Ladies of Hollywood&quot;, was commissioned by the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency Art Program as a tribute to the multi-ethnic women of the entertainment industry. The installation consists of a square stainless steel Art Deco-style structure or gazebo, with an arched roof supporting a circular dome that is topped by a central obelisk with descending neon block letters spelling &quot;Hollywood&quot; on each of its four sides. Atop the obelisk is a small gilded weather vane-style sculpture of Marilyn Monroe in her iconic billowing skirt pose from &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;. The corners of the domed structure are supported by four caryatids sculpted by Harl West representing African-American actress Dorothy Dandridge, Asian-American actress Anna May Wong, Mexican actress Dolores del Río, and Brooklyn-born actress Mae West. The installation stands at the western end of the Hollywood Walk of Fame at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and North La Brea Avenue.

The gazebo was dedicated on February 1, 1994, to a mixed reception. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; art critic Christopher Knight called it &quot;the most depressingly awful work of public art in recent years&quot;, representing the opposite of Hardwicke&#x27;s intended tribute to women. &quot;Sex, as a woman&#x27;s historic gateway to Hollywood&quot;, he wrote, &quot;couldn&#x27;t be more explicitly described&quot;.

Independent writer and film producer Gail Choice called it a fitting tribute to a group of pioneering and courageous women who &quot;carried a tremendous burden on their feminine shoulders&quot;. &quot;Never in my wildest dreams did I believe I&#x27;d ever see women of color immortalized in such a creative and wonderful fashion.&quot; Hardwicke contended that critics had missed the &quot;humor and symbolism&quot; of the structure, which &quot;embraces and pokes fun at the glamour, the polished metallic male form of the Oscar, and the pastiche of styles and dreams that pervades Tinseltown.&quot;

In June 2019, the Marilyn Monroe statue above the gazebo was stolen by Austin Clay, who had vandalized Donald Trump&#x27;s star a year earlier.

==Homage==

Some fans show respect for star recipients both living and dead by laying flowers or other symbolic tributes at their stars. Others show their support in other ways; the star awarded to Julio Iglesias, for example, is kept in &quot;pristine condition [by] a devoted band of elderly women [who] scrub and polish it once a month&quot;.

The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has adopted the tradition of placing flower wreaths at the stars of newly deceased awardees; for example, Bette Davis in 1989, Katharine Hepburn in 2003, and Jackie Cooper in 2011. The stars of other deceased celebrities, such as Michael Jackson, Bruce Lee, Farrah Fawcett, Elizabeth Taylor, Charles Aznavour, Richard Pryor, Ricardo Montalbán, James Doohan, Frank Sinatra, Robin Williams, Joan Rivers, George Harrison, Aretha Franklin, Stan Lee, and Betty White have become impromptu memorial and vigil sites as well, and some continue to receive anniversary remembrances.

<text>Ringgold Wilmer Lardner Jr. (August 19, 1915 – October 31, 2000) was an American screenwriter. A member of the &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot;, he was blacklisted by the Hollywood film studios during the late 1940s and 1950s after his appearance as an &quot;unfriendly&quot; witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) leading to Lardner being found guilty of contempt of Congress.

Born in Chicago, he was the son of Ellis (Abbott) and journalist and humorist Ring Lardner and the brother of James, John, and David Lardner. He was educated at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and Princeton University. In his sophomore year he enrolled at the Anglo-American Institute of the University of Moscow. Lardner returned to New York and, in 1935, briefly worked at the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; before signing on as publicity director with David O. Selznick&#x27;s new movie company. Lardner joined the US Communist Party in 1937.

== Career ==
Lardner moved to Hollywood where he worked as a publicist and script doctor before going on to write his own material. This included &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1942), a film that won him and Michael Kanin the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. Lardner also worked on the scripts for the films &quot;Laura&quot; (1944), &quot;Brotherhood of Man&quot; (1946), &quot;Forever Amber&quot; (1947), and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970). The script of the latter earned him an Academy Award for Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.

Lardner held strong left-wing views, and in the 1930s helped to raise funds for the Republican cause during the Spanish Civil War. He was also involved in organizing anti-fascist demonstrations. His brother, James Lardner, was a member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, and was killed in action in Spain in 1938.

Although his political involvement upset the owners of the film studios, he continued to be employed and in 1947 became one of the highest paid scriptwriters in Hollywood when he signed a contract with 20th Century Fox at $2,000 a week (equivalent to $ a week in 2020).

=== Blacklisting ===

After the Second World War the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) began an investigation into the Hollywood motion picture industry. In September 1947, the HUAC interviewed 41 people who were working in Hollywood. These individuals attended voluntarily and became known as &quot;friendly witnesses&quot;. During their testimony, they named several people whom they accused of holding views sympathetic to communism.

Lardner appeared before the HUAC on October 30, 1947, but like Alvah Bessie, Herbert Biberman, Albert Maltz, Adrian Scott, Dalton Trumbo, Lester Cole, Edward Dmytryk, Samuel Ornitz and John Howard Lawson, he refused to answer any questions. Known as the &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot;, they claimed that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution clearly gave them the right to do this. HUAC and the courts during appeals disagreed and all were found guilty of contempt of Congress. Lardner was sentenced to 12 months in the Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury and fined $1,000. He had been dismissed by Fox on October 28, 1947.

Blacklisted by the Hollywood studios, Lardner worked for the next couple of years on the novel &quot;The Ecstasy of Owen Muir&quot; (1954). Beginning in 1955, Lardner and fellow blacklistee Ian McLellan Hunter, working under pseudonyms, wrote episodes of television series, including &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Sir Lancelot&quot;, and &quot;The Buccaneers&quot;, for producer Hannah Weinstein, an expatriate American living in England. For several years, meetings there with the producer were attended exclusively by Hunter, who had managed to gain a passport despite his political activities, whereas travel abroad for Lardner was deemed &quot;not in the best interest of the United States&quot; by the Passport Bureau, a restriction lasting from 1951 to 1958, when the Supreme Court ruled that passports could not be denied for political reasons.

The blacklist was lifted for Lardner when producer Martin Ransohoff and director Norman Jewison gave him screen credit for writing &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; (1965). His later work included &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and &quot;The Greatest&quot; (1977), for which he re-wrote the original script by Bill Gunn. His final film project was an adaptation of Roger Kahn&#x27;s book &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;.

According to Hungarian writer Miklós Vámos—who visited Lardner several times before his death—Lardner won an Academy Award for a movie he wrote under a pseudonym.

== Personal life ==
Lardner married Silvia Schulman, then David O. Selznick&#x27;s secretary, in 1937. They had two children, a son and a daughter, and divorced in 1945. In 1946, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Lardner married Frances Chaney, an actress, and they remained wed until his death in 2000. They had one son. Chaney had been married to Lardner&#x27;s brother, David, until his death in 1944 and had two children, a daughter and a son, from that marriage.

=== Death ===
Lardner died of cancer on October 31, 2000, Halloween night, in his apartment in Manhattan, New York. He was the last surviving member of the Hollywood Ten.

<doc id="105784" wikidata="Q15791580" url="?curid=105784" title="Álfröðull">
<text>Álfröðull (Old Norse &quot;elf-beam&quot;, &quot;elf-disc&quot; or &quot;elf-glory, elf-heaven&quot;) is a term and common kenning in Norse mythology. It is ambiguous, referring both to the sun-chariot of the sun goddess Sól (for example, Alfröðull is said to shine in &quot;Skírnismál&quot;, verse 4) and to the rider (Sól herself). Álfröðull is pulled by two horses, Árvakr and Alsviðr. The chariot is pursued by the wolf Sköll. According to Norse mythology, prior to Ragnarök, Álfröðull will give birth to a daughter and after she is eaten by the wolf, the daughter will take her place.

==&quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;==
According to the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, verses 46–47:

Óðinn kvað:

:&quot;Hvaðan kemr sól
:á inn slétta himin,
:er þessa hefr Fenrir farit?&quot;

Vafþrúðnir kvað:

:&quot;Eina dóttur
:berr Alfröðull,
:áðr hana Fenrir fari;
:sú skal ríða,
:þá er regin deyja,
:móður brautir, mær.&quot; 

Benjamin Thorpe&#x27;s translation:

Gagnrâd:
:&quot;Whence will come the sun
:in that fair heaven,
:when Fenrir has this devoured?&quot;

Vafthrûdnir:
:&quot;A daughter
:shall Alfrodull bear,
:ere Fenrir shall have swallowed her. 
:The maid shall ride, 
:when the powers die, 
:on her mother&#x27;s course.&quot;

Snorri Sturluson cites this passage in his account of Ragnarök in the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; section of his &quot;Prose Edda&quot;.

==Skaldic verse==

Álfröðull also occurs as a kenning for the sun in skaldic verse; the simplex, &quot;röðull&quot;, is used with the same meaning, and Alaric Hall therefore suggests in his book on the elves that the choice of &quot;álfröðull&quot; depended on alliteration, but that the existence of the kenning suggests that the concepts of the sun and the elves were &quot;semantically congruent&quot;; he considers the &quot;álfr&quot; (elf) in &quot;álfröðull&quot; possibly a heiti for Freyr.

<doc id="105796" wikidata="Q373069" url="?curid=105796" title="Evangelism">
<text>Evangelism, or witnessing, is the act of sharing the Christian gospel, the message and teachings of Jesus Christ. It is typically done with the intention of converting others to Christianity. Evangelism can take several forms, such as personal conversations, preaching, media, and is especially associated with missionary work.

Christians who specialize in evangelism are often known as evangelists, whether they are in their home communities or living as missionaries in the field, although some Christian traditions refer to such people as &quot;missionaries&quot; in either case. Some Christian traditions consider evangelists to be in a leadership position; they may be found preaching to large meetings or in governance roles. In addition, Christian groups who encourage evangelism are sometimes known as evangelistic or &quot;evangelist&quot;.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;evangelist&quot; comes from the Koine Greek word (transliterated as &quot;euangelion&quot;) via Latinised &quot;evangelium&quot; as used in the canonical titles of the Four Gospels, authored by (or attributed to) Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John (also known as the Four Evangelists). The Greek word originally meant a reward given to the messenger for good news ( = &quot;good&quot;, = &quot;I bring a message&quot;; the word &quot;angel&quot; comes from the same root) and later &quot;good news&quot; itself.

The verb form of &quot;euangelion&quot;, (translated as &quot;evangelism&quot;), occurs rarely in older Greek literature outside the New Testament, making its meaning more difficult to ascertain. Parallel texts of the Gospels of Luke and Mark reveal a synonymous relationship between the verb &quot;euangelizo&quot; () and a Greek verb &quot;kerusso&quot; (), which means &quot;to proclaim&quot;.

==Methods==

Common forms of spreading Evangelism include preaching or distributing bibles; in tracts, newspapers, and magazines; through the electronic media; and by street evangelists. The Bible records that Jesus sent out his disciples to evangelize by visiting peoples homes in pairs of two believers (cf. ). In the same text, Jesus mentioned that few people were willing to evangelize, despite there being many people who would be receptive to his Gospel message.

The child evangelism movement, which focuses on evangelizing children between the ages of 4 and 14 years old, originated in the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, a group of Christian athletes known as The Power Team spawned an entire genre of Christian entertainment based on strong-man exploits mixed with a Christian message and usually accompanied by an opportunity to respond with a prayer for salvation. New opportunities for evangelism have been provided in recent decades by increased travel opportunities and by instant communications over the internet.
==Missionary work==
===Catholicism===
===Protestantism===
In 1831, the Presbyterian Mission Agency was founded by the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.

==== Evangelicalism ====
Various evangelical mission organizations have specialized in evangelism throughout history. In 1792, BMS World Mission was founded in Kettering, England by William Carey. In 1814, the American Baptist International Ministries was founded by the American Baptist Churches USA in United States. In 1865, OMF International was founded by Hudson Taylor in England. In 1893, in Lagos in Nigeria, SIM was founded by Walter Gowans, Rowland Bingham, and Thomas Kent. Samuel E. Hill, John H. Nicholson, and William J. Knights founded Gideons International, an organization which distributes free Bibles to hotels, motels, hospitals, military bases, prisons, schools, and universities, in Janesville in Wisconsin, United States, in 1899.

In 1922, Canadian evangelical evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, founder of the Foursquare Church, was the first woman to use radio to reach a wider audience in the United States. In 1951, producer Dick Ross and Baptist evangelist Billy Graham founded the film production company World Wide Pictures, which would make videos of his preaching and Christian films.

In 1960, more than half of the Protestant American missionaries were evangelical. American and European Pentecostal missionaries are also numerous, Pentecostalism can develop independently by non-foreign residents in various regions of the world, notably in Africa, South America, and Asia. Youth with a Mission was founded in 1960 in United States by Loren Cunningham and his wife Darlene.

The Christian Broadcasting Network was founded in 1961 in Virginia Beach, United States, by Baptist minister Pat Robertson.

In 1974, Billy Graham and the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization organized the First International Congress on World Evangelization in Lausanne.

In July 1999, TopChrétien, an evangelical Christian web portal and social network, was launched by Éric Célérier, pastor of the Assemblies of God of France and Estelle Martin. 

In 2004, South Korea became the second-largest source of missionaries in the world, after the United States and ahead of England.

In January 2007, GodTube, a site for sharing videos related to Christianity, especially evangelical, was founded by Christopher Wyatt of Plano, Texas, in the United States, then a student at Dallas Theological Seminary.

In 2007, there were over 10,000 Baptist missionaries in overseas missions around the world.

== Controversies ==
Some consider evangelism to be proselytising, which is protected in the United States but illegal in some countries, while others where it is suppressed argue it is merely free speech. The fact that evangelicals speak about their faith in public is sometimes criticized by the media and it is often associated with proselytism. According to the evangelicals, freedom of religion and freedom of expression allow them to discuss their faith like they would discuss other topics.

Christian films made by American evangelical production companies are also regularly associated with proselytism. According to Sarah-Jane Murray, screenwriting teacher at the US Film and Christian Television Commission United, Christian films are works of art, not proselytism. For Hubert de Kerangat, communications manager at SAJE Distribution, a distributor of these American Christian films in France, if Christian films are considered proselytism, all films are a form of proselytism, since films of all genres could each be said to carry a message.

<text>The statvolt is a unit of voltage and electrical potential used in the CGS-ESU and gaussian systems of units. In terms of its relation to the SI units, one statvolt corresponds to  , i.e. to 299.792458 volts.

The statvolt is also defined in the CGS system as 1 erg per statcoulomb.
It is a useful unit for electromagnetism because, in vacuum, an electric field of one statvolt per centimetre has the same energy density as a magnetic field of one gauss. Likewise, a plane wave propagating in vacuum has perpendicular electric and magnetic fields such that for every gauss of magnetic field intensity there is one statvolt/cm of electric field intensity.

In the CGS-EMU system, the unit of voltage is the abvolt.

<text>Carlos Javier Rivera Massó (born June 13, 1969 in San Juan, Puerto Rico), better known as Charlie Massó, is a Puerto Rican singer and actor. Massó is a former member of Menudo, joining the band at the height of Menudo&#x27;s worldwide fame. He replaced Rene Farrait and quickly became a fan favorite with his participation on the albums of &quot;Por Amor&quot; and &quot;Una Aventura Llamada Menudo&quot;, which was the name of both Menudo&#x27;s second movie and of the soundtrack album for it. Charlie recorded 14 albums with Menudo, two were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album in 1984 and 85.

==Career==
Massó began his life as a Menudo the very moment that one of Menudo&#x27;s members of the group&#x27;s &quot;golden era,&quot; Farrait, left the group. However, Massó&#x27;s presence helped extend the golden era an additional three years, and when he left the group in 1987, he was the last member of the group&#x27;s golden years to leave. Massó was a member of Menudo during their most commercially successful period in the States, which included the group&#x27;s highest-charting U.S. single, &quot;Hold Me&quot; (#62 on the Billboard Hot 100.) Massó&#x27;s bandmates included Xavier Serbiá, Johnny Lozada, Ricky Meléndez, Miguel Cancel, Ray Reyes, Roy Rosselló, Robby Rosa and Ricky Martin, among others. He returned to Menudo to complete a tour in Brazil, their 1987 Summer in the Streets tour, after Robby Rosa quit the group, to introduce new member Ruben Gomez and for their last tour in the Philippines when Ralphy Rodriguez was pulled out of the group by his parents late that year.

In 1985 Menudo visited Manila, Philippines twice for their concert at the Folk Arts Theater, with several guest appearances on Eat Bulaga, Vilma in Person &amp; GMA Supershow. Menudo&#x27;s popularity in Philippines was helped with their fluency in many languages. This was expressed in Spanish, English and Filipino songs. In 1986, Charlie sang &quot; Di Na Natuto&quot;, a Tagalog song to serenade a young Filipina originally sung by Gary Valenciano. Charlie&#x27;s duet with Lea Salonga, &quot;I Still Believe&quot; was a big hit in 1988-89.

Charlie left the band in 1987, being replaced by Ralphy Rodriguez, though Masso will remain in the group to fill in if members were unable to sing, including Rodriguez himself as he departed the group months later and Masso filled in the spot for him. After the tour, Massó moved to Mexico for many years, where he showcased his acting in soap operas. He became married and had a family. In 1998 he was recruited by bandmate Ray Reyes while singing with a merengue orquesta, Grupo KAOS, and joined Meléndez, Farrait, Lozada, Reyes and Cancel in touring many of the places where they had acquired millions of fans as Menudos, with El Reencuentro.

In 2001 he appeared in &quot;12 Horas&quot;, a Puerto Rican movie written and directed by Raúl Marchand Sánchez.

Massó quit El Reencuentro during 2015 and joined Farrait, Cancel and Reyes in another Menudo-reunion band they named &quot;Menudomania Forever&quot;.

<text>In electronics, a remote control (also known as a remote or clicker) is an electronic device used to operate another device from a distance, usually wirelessly. In consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player or other digital home media appliance. A remote control can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. They function best when used from a short distance. This is primarily a convenience feature for the user. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside.

Early television remote controls (1956–1977) used ultrasonic tones. Present-day remote controls are commonly consumer infrared devices which send digitally-coded pulses of infrared radiation. They control functions such as power, volume, channels, playback, track change, energy, fan speed, and various other features. Remote controls for these devices are usually small wireless handheld objects with an array of buttons. They are used to adjust various settings such as television channel, track number, and volume. The remote control code, and thus the required remote control device, is usually specific to a product line. However, there are universal remotes, which emulate the remote control made for most major brand devices.

Remote controls in the 2000s include Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity, motion sensor-enabled capabilities and voice control. Remote controls for 2010s onward Smart TVs may feature a standalone keyboard on the rear side to facilitate typing, and be usable as a pointing device.

==History==

Wired and wireless remote control was developed in the latter half of the 19th century to meet the need to control unmanned vehicles (for the most part military torpedoes). These included a wired version by German engineer Werner von Siemens in 1870, and radio controlled ones by British engineer Ernest Wilson and C. J. Evans (1897) and a prototype that inventor Nikola Tesla demonstrated in New York in 1898. In 1903 Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo introduced a radio based control system called the &quot;Telekino&quot; at the Paris Academy of Sciences, which he hoped to use to control a dirigible airship of his own design. Unlike previous “on/off” techniques, the &quot;Telekino&quot; was able to execute a finite but not limited set of different mechanical actions using a single communication channel. From 1904 to 1906 Torres chose to conduct &quot;Telekino&quot; testings in the form of a three-wheeled land vehicle with an effective range of 20 to 30 meters, and guiding a manned electrically powered boat, which demonstrated a standoff range of 2 kilometers. The first remote-controlled model airplane flew in 1932, and the use of remote control technology for military purposes was worked on intensively during the Second World War, one result of this being the German Wasserfall missile.

By the late 1930s, several radio manufacturers offered remote controls for some of their higher-end models. Most of these were connected to the set being controlled by wires, but the Philco Mystery Control (1939) was a battery-operated low-frequency radio transmitter, thus making it the first wireless remote control for a consumer electronics device. Using pulse-count modulation, this also was the first digital wireless remote control.

===Television remote controls===
One of the first remote intended to control a television was developed by Zenith Radio Corporation in 1950. The remote, called Lazy Bones, was connected to the television by a wire. A wireless remote control, the Flash-Matic, was developed in 1955 by Eugene Polley. It worked by shining a beam of light onto one of four photoelectric cells, but the cell did not distinguish between light from the remote and light from other sources. The Flashmatic also had to be pointed very precisely at one of the sensors in order to work.
In 1956, Robert Adler developed Zenith Space Command, a wireless remote. It was mechanical and used ultrasound to change the channel and volume. When the user pushed a button on the remote control, it struck a bar and clicked, hence they were commonly called &quot;clickers&quot;, and the mechanics were similar to a pluck. Each of the four bars emitted a different fundamental frequency with ultrasonic harmonics, and circuits in the television detected these sounds and interpreted them as channel-up, channel-down, sound-on/off, and power-on/off.

Later, the rapid decrease in price of transistors made possible cheaper electronic remotes that contained a piezoelectric crystal that was fed by an oscillating electric current at a frequency near or above the upper threshold of human hearing, though still audible to dogs. The receiver contained a microphone attached to a circuit that was tuned to the same frequency. Some problems with this method were that the receiver could be triggered accidentally by naturally occurring noises or deliberately by metal against glass, for example, and some people could hear the lower ultrasonic harmonics.
In 1970, RCA introduced an all-electronic remote control that uses digital signals and metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) memory. This was widely adopted for color television, replacing motor-driven tuning controls.

The impetus for a more complex type of television remote control came in 1973, with the development of the Ceefax teletext service by the BBC. Most commercial remote controls at that time had a limited number of functions, sometimes as few as three: next channel, previous channel, and volume/off. This type of control did not meet the needs of Teletext sets, where pages were identified with three-digit numbers. A remote control that selects Teletext pages would need buttons for each numeral from zero to nine, as well as other control functions, such as switching from text to picture, and the normal television controls of volume, channel, brightness, color intensity, etc. Early Teletext sets used wired remote controls to select pages, but the continuous use of the remote control required for Teletext quickly indicated the need for a wireless device. So BBC engineers began talks with one or two television manufacturers, which led to early prototypes in around 1977–1978 that could control many more functions. ITT was one of the companies and later gave its name to the ITT protocol of infrared communication.
In 1980, the most popular remote control was the &quot;Starcom Cable TV Converter&quot; (from Jerrold Electronics, a division of General Instrument) which used 40-kHz sound to change channels. Then, a Canadian company, Viewstar, Inc., was formed by engineer Paul Hrivnak and started producing a cable TV converter with an infrared remote control. The product was sold through Philips for approximately $190 CAD. The Viewstar converter was an immediate success, the millionth converter being sold on March 21, 1985, with 1.6 million sold by 1989.

===Other remote controls===
The Blab-off was a wired remote control created in 1952 that turned a TV&#x27;s (television) sound on or off so that viewers could avoid hearing commercials. In the 1980s Steve Wozniak of Apple started a company named CL 9. The purpose of this company was to create a remote control that could operate multiple electronic devices. The CORE unit (Controller Of Remote Equipment) was introduced in the fall of 1987. The advantage to this remote controller was that it could &quot;learn&quot; remote signals from different devices. It had the ability to perform specific or multiple functions at various times with its built-in clock. It was the first remote control that could be linked to a computer and loaded with updated software code as needed. The CORE unit never made a huge impact on the market. It was much too cumbersome for the average user to program, but it received rave reviews from those who could. These obstacles eventually led to the demise of CL 9, but two of its employees continued the business under the name Celadon. This was one of the first computer-controlled learning remote controls on the market.

In the 1990s, cars were increasingly sold with electronic remote control door locks. These remotes transmit a signal to the car which locks or unlocks the door locks or unlocks the trunk. An aftermarket device sold in some countries is the remote starter. This enables a car owner to remotely start their car. This feature is most associated with countries with winter climates, where users may wish to run the car for several minutes before they intend to use it, so that the car heater and defrost systems can remove ice and snow from the windows.

===Proliferation===

By the early 2000s, the number of consumer electronic devices in most homes greatly increased, along with the number of remotes to control those devices. According to the Consumer Electronics Association, an average US home has four remotes. To operate a home theater as many as five or six remotes may be required, including one for cable or satellite receiver, VCR or digital video recorder (DVR/PVR), DVD player, TV and audio amplifier. Several of these remotes may need to be used sequentially for some programs or services to work properly. However, as there are no accepted interface guidelines, the process is increasingly cumbersome. One solution used to reduce the number of remotes that have to be used is the universal remote, a remote control that is programmed with the operation codes for most major brands of TVs, DVD players, etc. In the early 2010s, many smartphone manufacturers began incorporating infrared emitters into their devices, thereby enabling their use as universal remotes via an included or downloadable app.

==Technique==
The main technology used in home remote controls is infrared (IR) light. The signal between a remote control handset and the device it controls consists of pulses of infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye but can be seen through a digital camera, video camera or phone camera. The transmitter in the remote control handset sends out a stream of pulses of infrared light when the user presses a button on the handset. A transmitter is often a light-emitting diode (LED) which is built into the pointing end of the remote control handset. The infrared light pulses form a pattern unique to that button. The receiver in the device recognizes the pattern and causes the device to respond accordingly.

===Opto components and circuits===


Most remote controls for electronic appliances use a near infrared diode to emit a beam of light that reaches the device. A 940 nm wavelength LED is typical. This infrared light is not visible to the human eye but picked up by sensors on the receiving device. Video cameras see the diode as if it produces visible purple light. With a single channel (single-function, one-button) remote control the presence of a carrier signal can be used to trigger a function. For multi-channel (normal multi-function) remote controls more sophisticated procedures are necessary: one consists of modulating the carrier with signals of different frequencies. After the receiver demodulates the received signal, it applies the appropriate frequency filters to separate the respective signals. One can often hear the signals being modulated on the infrared carrier by operating a remote control in very close proximity to an AM radio not tuned to a station. Today, IR remote controls almost always use a pulse width modulated code, encoded and decoded by a digital computer: a command from a remote control consists of a short train of pulses of carrier-present and carrier-not-present of varying widths.

===Consumer electronics infrared protocols===
Different manufacturers of infrared remote controls use different protocols to transmit the infrared commands. The RC-5 protocol that has its origins within Philips, uses, for instance, a total of 14 bits for each button press. The bit pattern is modulated onto a carrier frequency that, again, can be different for different manufacturers and standards, in the case of RC-5, the carrier is 36 kHz. Other consumer infrared protocols include the various versions of SIRCS used by Sony, the RC-6 from Philips, the Ruwido R-Step, and the NEC TC101 protocol.

===Infrared, line of sight and operating angle===
Since infrared (IR) remote controls use light, they require line of sight to operate the destination device. The signal can, however, be reflected by mirrors, just like any other light source. If operation is required where no line of sight is possible, for instance when controlling equipment in another room or installed in a cabinet, many brands of IR extenders are available for this on the market. Most of these have an IR receiver, picking up the IR signal and relaying it via radio waves to the remote part, which has an IR transmitter mimicking the original IR control. Infrared receivers also tend to have a more or less limited operating angle, which mainly depends on the optical characteristics of the phototransistor. However, it is easy to increase the operating angle using a matte transparent object in front of the receiver.

===Radio remote control systems===
Radio remote control (RF remote control) is used to control distant objects using a variety of radio signals transmitted by the remote control device. As a complementary method to infrared remote controls, the radio remote control is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, Zigbee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most remote controls use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be &quot;universal&quot;, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a &quot;universal remote control duplicator&quot; because it is able to copy existing remote controls, while the receiver is called a &quot;universal receiver&quot; because it works with almost any remote control in the market.

A radio remote control system commonly has two parts: transmit and receive. The transmitter part is divided into two parts, the RF remote control and the transmitter module. This allows the transmitter module to be used as a component in a larger application. The transmitter module is small, but users must have detailed knowledge to use it; combined with the RF remote control it is much simpler to use.

The receiver is generally one of two types: a super-regenerative receiver or a superheterodyne. The super-regenerative receiver works like that of an intermittent oscillation detection circuit. The superheterodyne works like the one in a radio receiver. The superheterodyne receiver is used because of its stability, high sensitivity and it has relatively good anti-interference ability, a small package and lower price.

==Usage==

===Industry===
A remote control is used for controlling substations, pump storage power stations and HVDC-plants. For these systems often PLC-systems working in the longwave range are used.

===Power line remote control===
A subset of Power-Line communication that sends remote control signals over energized AC power lines. This was used to remotely control home automation before the invention of WIFI connected smart switches. 

===Garage and gate===
Garage and gate remote controls are very common, especially in some countries such as the US, Australia, and the UK, where garage doors, gates and barriers are widely used. Such a remote is very simple by design, usually only one button, and some with more buttons to control several gates from one control. Such remotes can be divided into two categories by the encoder type used: fixed code and rolling code. If you find dip-switches in the remote, it is likely to be fixed code, an older technology which was widely used. However, fixed codes have been criticized for their (lack of) security, thus rolling code has been more and more widely used in later installations.

===Military===

Remotely operated torpedoes were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedoes. The early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedoes by John Ericsson (pneumatic), John Louis Lay (electric wire guided), and Victor von Scheliha (electric wire guided).

The Brennan torpedo, invented by Louis Brennan in 1877 was powered by two contra-rotating propellers that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo. Differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target, making it &quot;the world&#x27;s first &quot;practical&quot; guided missile&quot;. In 1898 Nikola Tesla publicly demonstrated a &quot;wireless&quot; radio-controlled torpedo that he hoped to sell to the U.S. Navy.

Archibald Low was known as the &quot;father of radio guidance systems&quot; for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during the First World War. In 1917, he demonstrated a remote-controlled aircraft to the Royal Flying Corps and in the same year built the first wire-guided rocket. As head of the secret RFC experimental works at Feltham, A. M. Low was the first person to use radio control successfully on an aircraft, an &quot;Aerial Target&quot;. It was &quot;piloted&quot; from the ground by future world aerial speed record holder Henry Segrave. Low&#x27;s systems encoded the command transmissions as a countermeasure to prevent enemy intervention. By 1918 the secret D.C.B. Section of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Signals School, Portsmouth under the command of Eric Robinson V.C. used a variant of the Aerial Target&#x27;s radio control system to control from ‘mother’ aircraft different types of naval vessels including a submarine.

The military also developed several early remote control vehicles. In World War I, the Imperial German Navy employed FL-boats (Fernlenkboote) against coastal shipping. These were driven by internal combustion engines and controlled remotely from a shore station through several miles of wire wound on a spool on the boat. An aircraft was used to signal directions to the shore station. EMBs carried a high explosive charge in the bow and traveled at speeds of thirty knots. The Soviet Red Army used remotely controlled teletanks during the 1930s in the Winter War against Finland and the early stages of World War II. A teletank is controlled by radio from a control tank at a distance of 500 to 1,500 meters, the two constituting a &quot;telemechanical group&quot;. The Red Army fielded at least two teletank battalions at the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. There were also remotely controlled cutters and experimental remotely controlled planes in the Red Army.

Remote controls in military usage employ jamming and countermeasures against jamming. Jammers are used to disable or sabotage the enemy&#x27;s use of remote controls. The distances for military remote controls also tend to be much longer, up to intercontinental distance satellite-linked remote controls used by the U.S. for their unmanned airplanes (drones) in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. Remote controls are used by insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan to attack coalition and government troops with roadside improvised explosive devices, and terrorists in Iraq are reported in the media to use modified TV remote controls to detonate bombs.

===Space===

In the winter of 1971, the Soviet Union explored the surface of the Moon with the lunar vehicle Lunokhod 1, the first roving remote-controlled robot to land on another celestial body. Remote control technology is also used in space travel, for instance, the Soviet Lunokhod vehicles were remote-controlled from the ground. Many space exploration rovers can be remotely controlled, though vast distance to a vehicle results in a long time delay between transmission and receipt of a command.

===PC control===
Existing infrared remote controls can be used to control PC applications. Any application that supports shortcut keys can be controlled via infrared remote controls from other home devices (TV, VCR, AC). This is widely used with multimedia applications for PC based home theater systems. For this to work, one needs a device that decodes IR remote control data signals and a PC application that communicates to this device connected to PC. A connection can be made via serial port, USB port or motherboard IrDA connector. Such devices are commercially available but can be homemade using low-cost microcontrollers. LIRC (Linux IR Remote control) and WinLIRC (for Windows) are software packages developed for the purpose of controlling PC using TV remote and can be also used for homebrew remote with lesser modification.

===Photography===
Remote controls are used in photography, in particular to take long-exposure shots. Many action cameras such as the GoPros as well as standard DSLRs including Sony&#x27;s Alpha series incorporate Wi-Fi based remote control systems. These can often be accessed and even controlled via cell-phones and other mobile devices.

===Video games===

Video game consoles had not used wireless controllers until recently, mainly because of the difficulty involved in playing the game while keeping the infrared transmitter pointed at the console. Early wireless controllers were cumbersome and when powered on alkaline batteries, lasted only a few hours before they needed replacement. Some wireless controllers were produced by third parties, in most cases using a radio link instead of infrared. Even these were very inconsistent, and in some cases, had transmission delays, making them virtually useless. Some examples include the Double Player for NES, the Master System Remote Control System and the Wireless Dual Shot for the PlayStation.

The first official wireless game controller made by a first party manufacturer was the CX-42 for Atari 2600. The Philips CD-i 400 series also came with a remote control, the WaveBird was also produced for the GameCube. In the seventh generation of gaming consoles, wireless controllers became standard. Some wireless controllers, such as those of the PlayStation 3 and Wii, use Bluetooth. Others, like the Xbox 360, use proprietary wireless protocols.

==Standby power==
To be turned on by a wireless remote, the controlled appliance must always be partly on, consuming standby power.

==Alternatives==
Hand-gesture recognition has been researched as an alternative to remote controls for television sets.

<text>The Battle of Naseby took place on 14 June 1645 during the First English Civil War, near the village of Naseby in Northamptonshire. The Parliamentarian New Model Army, commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell, destroyed the main Royalist army under Charles I and Prince Rupert. The defeat ended any real hope of royalist victory, although Charles did not finally surrender until May 1646.

The 1645 campaign began in April when the newly formed New Model Army marched west to relieve Taunton, before being ordered back to lay siege to Oxford, the Royalist wartime capital. On 31 May, the Royalists stormed Leicester and Fairfax was instructed to abandon the siege and engage them. Although heavily outnumbered, Charles decided to stand and fight and after several hours of combat, his force was effectively destroyed. The Royalists suffered over 1,000 casualties, with over 4,500 of their infantry captured and paraded through the streets of London; they would never again field an army of comparable quality.

They also lost all their artillery and stores, along with Charles&#x27; personal baggage and private papers, which revealed his attempts to bring the Irish Catholic Confederation and foreign mercenaries into the war. These were published in a pamphlet titled &quot;The King&#x27;s Cabinet Opened&quot;, whose appearance was a great boost to the cause of Parliament.

==Background==
In July 1644, a Parliamentarian force under Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell secured control of Northern England by victory at Marston Moor. However, this was offset first by defeat at Lostwithiel in September, then lack of decisiveness at the Second Battle of Newbury in October. The two commanders involved, Essex and Manchester, were accused by many in Parliament of lacking commitment, a group that included moderates like Sir William Waller as well as radicals like Cromwell.

In December, Sir Henry Vane introduced the Self-denying Ordinance, requiring any military officers to resign from Parliament. As members of the House of Lords, Manchester and Essex were automatically removed since unlike MPs they could not resign their titles, although they could be re-appointed, &#x27;if Parliament approved.&#x27; It also led to the creation of the New Model Army, a centralised, professional force. Moderates Fairfax and Philip Skippon were appointed Commander-in-Chief and head of the infantry, respectively; Cromwell remained an MP but was given command of the cavalry on a &#x27;temporary&#x27; three-month commission, constantly renewed.

At the outset of 1645, the Royalist high command was divided on strategy. Prince Rupert of the Rhine, recently appointed senior commander, wanted to link up with his brother Prince Maurice at Chester and retake the north, a key source of recruits and supplies. A faction headed by Lord Digby considered the New Model a threat to their capital at Oxford, while a third group preferred to consolidate control of the West Country. On 30 April, Fairfax marched west to relieve the Parliamentarian stronghold of Taunton; Lord Goring was despatched with 3,000 cavalry to support the Siege of Taunton, while the main Royalist field army of 8,600 men under Charles I and Prince Rupert moved north.

Concerned by this threat, Parliament&#x27;s Committee of Both Kingdoms ordered Fairfax to change his plans and besiege Oxford. Although he made little progress, by the end of May the town was running short of provisions and to relieve the pressure, the Royalists stormed the Parliamentarian-held town of Leicester on 31 May, allegedly killing over 700 soldiers and civilians. Alarmed by this, Parliament instructed Fairfax to abandon the siege and on 5 June he marched north to engage the Royalist army. Unlike Prince Rupert who had been beaten by Fairfax and Cromwell the previous summer, Digby and Charles dismissed the fighting capabilities of the New Model. Despite being seriously outnumbered, they were eager for battle; messages were sent ordering Goring to rejoin them, but he refused to leave the West Country.

On 12 June, the Royalists were alerted to the presence of the New Model when Parliamentarian patrols clashed with their outposts near Daventry. The next day, Fairfax was reinforced by Cromwell&#x27;s cavalry and troops from the Eastern Association under Edward Rossiter, bringing his numbers up to 14,000. Although Prince Rupert favoured withdrawing, Digby convinced Charles that retreat would be bad for morale and they decided to stand and fight.

==Battle==

The morning of 14 June was foggy, preventing the opposing armies from sighting each other across the battlefield. The Royalists occupied a strong position on a ridge between the villages of Little Oxendon and East Farndon about south of Market Harborough. The Royalist scoutmaster, Sir Francis Ruce, was sent out to find the Parliamentarian army and rode south for but saw no sign of it, perhaps through negligence. Rupert himself moved forward and saw some Parliamentarian cavalry, apparently retiring. He was determined to secure the commanding Naseby ridge and ordered the Royalist army to advance.

Fairfax initially considered occupying the northern slopes of Naseby ridge. Cromwell believed that this position was too strong, and that the Royalists would refuse battle rather than attack it. He is said to have sent a message to Fairfax, saying, &quot;I beseech you, withdraw to yonder hill, which may provoke the enemy to charge us&quot;. Fairfax agreed, and moved his army back slightly.

The Royalists did not see Fairfax&#x27;s position until they reached the village of Clipston, just over a mile north of Naseby ridge. It was clearly impossible for the Royalists to withdraw to their original position without being attacked by the Parliamentarian cavalry while on the line of march and therefore at a disadvantage. Rupert deployed the army to its right, where the ground appeared to be more favourable for his own cavalry and prepared for battle.

===Deployments===

====Royalists====
The Royalists occupied a front of about a mile and a half, between the Clipston-Naseby track on the left and the Sulby Hedges on the right. Their right wing consisted of between 2,000 and 3,000 cavalry under Prince Rupert and his brother Prince Maurice. The centre was commanded by Lord Astley and organised as three infantry brigades or &quot;tertias&quot; under Sir George Lisle, Henry Bard and Astley&#x27;s son, Sir Bernard Astley, with a regiment of horse under Colonel Howard in support. On the left under Sir Marmaduke Langdale were 1,500 &quot;Northern Horse&quot;, the remnants of cavalry regiments which had escaped from Marston Moor. Charles commanded a small reserve, consisting of his own and Rupert&#x27;s regiments of foot (800 in total) and his lifeguard of horse.

====Parliamentarians====
Fairfax had drawn up his army on the ridge a mile north of Naseby, although some of it was behind the crest on the reverse slope. Ireton&#x27;s wing of five and a half regiments of cavalry was on the left. The infantry under Sergeant-Major General Sir Philip Skippon was in the centre with five regiments on the front line and three in support. A forlorn hope of 300 musketeers was deployed to the front, with a reserve provided by two companies of Colonel Edward Harley&#x27;s regiment, commanded by its Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Pride. A Parliamentarian engraving of the battle shows 11 pieces of artillery, in the intervals between the infantry regiments. They played little part in the battle; their first salvoes went high, and the Royalist and Parliamentarian infantry were subsequently too closely engaged for the guns to be used. Cromwell&#x27;s wing, with six and a half regiments of cavalry, was on the right.

The Parliamentarian army occupied a front about long. They outflanked the Royalist left, but their own left flank rested, like the Royalists&#x27; right flank, on the Sulby Hedges. At the last minute, as the Royalists began to advance, Cromwell sent a regiment of dragoons under Colonel John Okey into the Sulby Hedges, where they could fire into the flank of Rupert&#x27;s cavalry. The number of dragoons has generally been reported as their official strength of 1,000 but an analysis of pay warrants shows it was no more than 676 in total.

===Action===

The Royalist centre attacked first, with Rupert keeping his own wing of cavalry in hand so that the horse and foot could hit the enemy simultaneously. Skippon&#x27;s infantry moved forward over the crest of the ridge to meet the Royalist foot. There was time for only one volley of musketry before both sides were fighting hand-to-hand, the veteran Royalist infantry using their swords and the butt ends of their muskets. Sir Edward Walker, Charles&#x27;s secretary of war, stated &quot;The Foot on either side hardly saw each other until they were within Carabine Shot, and so made only one Volley; our falling in with Sword and butt end of the Musquet did notable Execution, so much as I saw their Colours fall and their Foot in great Disorder.&quot; Skippon was wounded by a bullet which splintered his armour and struck him under the ribs, although he stayed on the field to prevent panic from spreading. Even so, the Parliamentarians were hard-pressed and forced back.

On the Parliamentarian left, the opposing wings of horse paused briefly to dress ranks before charging into each other. Henry Ireton&#x27;s own regiment repulsed their Royalist opposite numbers, but Ireton then led at least part of them to the aid of the beleaguered Parliamentarian infantry. His troopers were driven off by Royalist pikemen, and Ireton himself was unhorsed, wounded in the leg and face and taken prisoner. At the same time, the second line of Royalist cavalry broke most of the Parliamentarian horsemen. Some of Ireton&#x27;s regiments, on the far left, were saved from destruction by the fire from Okey&#x27;s dragoons, but the others broke and fled, some of them not stopping until they reached Northampton, away. The entire Royalist right wing had been committed to defeating Ireton, and none were left in reserve. Rupert either neglected or was unable to rally the cavalier horsemen, who galloped off the battlefield in pursuit of the fleeing Parliamentarians.

Meanwhile, the Parliamentarian right wing of horse under Cromwell and the Royalist Northern Horse faced each other, neither willing to charge to the aid of their infantry while the other could threaten their flank. Eventually, after half an hour, the Royalist cavalry began to charge and Cromwell&#x27;s troops moved to meet them. Langdale&#x27;s men were not only outflanked and outnumbered two to one, but forced to charge up a slope broken up by bushes and a rabbit warren. After a brief contest, they were routed.

Unlike Rupert, Cromwell had roughly half of his wing uncommitted, as only the front line of Cromwell&#x27;s wing had taken part in the defeat of Langdale. He sent only four divisions (roughly two regiments) after Langdale, and turned his reserves against the left flank and rear of the Royalist centre. At about the same time, Okey&#x27;s dragoons mounted their horses and charged from the Sulby Hedges against the right wing of the Royalist infantry, as did some of Ireton&#x27;s regiments which had partly rallied.

Some of the trapped Royalist infantry began to throw down their arms and call for quarter; others tried to conduct a fighting retreat. One regiment, apparently Rupert&#x27;s &quot;Bluecoats&quot;, stood their ground and repulsed all attacks. One eyewitness said &quot;The Blue regiment of the Kings stood to it very stoutly, and stirred not, like a wall of brasse...&quot;. Eventually, Fairfax led his own regiment of foot and horse against them, breaking their resistance, with Fairfax reportedly capturing their standard himself. Archaeological evidence, chiefly recovered musket balls, suggests this episode took place in the vicinity of Long Hold Spinney, about behind the original Royalist positions.

At some stage, the King attempted to lead his lifeguard of horse to the rescue of his centre or in a counter-attack against Cromwell&#x27;s troopers, but was prevented from doing so by a Scottish nobleman, the Earl of Carnwath, who seized his bridle and said, &quot;Would you go upon your death, Sire?&quot; Seeing the King swerve away from the enemy, his lifeguard also retreated in disorder for several hundred yards. Meanwhile, Rupert&#x27;s cavalry had reached Naseby and the Parliamentarian baggage, whose escort refused to surrender and drove them off. Although Rupert rallied his men and returned to the battlefield, it was now too late to save the remnants of their infantry, and he could not induce his cavalry to make another charge. Fairfax halted and reorganised his lines, and when he resumed his advance, the Royalist cavalry withdrew.

Fairfax&#x27;s forces pursued survivors fleeing north towards Leicester. Archaeological evidence suggests fugitives and Royalist baggage guards tried to rally on the slopes of Castle Yard (also known as Wadborough Hill), a wooded hill with the ruins of a motte and bailey castle, about behind the original battle line. Many Royalists were slaughtered when they mistakenly followed what they thought was the main road to Leicester into the churchyard in the village of Marston Trussell, and were unable to escape their pursuers. In the aftermath of the battle, Parliamentarian troops reportedly killed at least 100 female camp followers and mutilated many others. This was supposedly done in the belief they were Irish, though the women were probably Welsh whose language was mistaken for Irish.

==Aftermath==

Fairfax recovered Leicester on 18 June. He immediately led his army southwest to relieve Taunton and capture the Royalist-held West Country. The Royalist forces surrendered at Truro in Cornwall, while leading Royalist commanders, including Lord Hopton, the Prince of Wales, Sir Edward Hyde, and Lord Capell, fled to Jersey from Falmouth.

The main Royalist military force had been shattered at Naseby. The King had lost his veteran infantry (including 500 officers), all his artillery, and many arms. He lacked the resources to create an army of such quality again, and after Naseby, it simply remained for the Parliamentarian armies to wipe out the last pockets of Royalist resistance. Charles hoped to rebuild his army with new recruits from Wales and the border counties and headed in that direction. He also had expectations that reinforcements might arrive from Ireland. The Committee of Both Kingdoms responded on 28 June by ordering Leven&#x27;s Scottish Covenanters to move to strike at the Royalist stronghold of Hereford. The ensuing Siege of Hereford by Covenanter forces ended in failure, but in December of the same year, Hereford was seized by John Birch in a surprise attack.

The Parliamentarians had also captured the King&#x27;s personal baggage, with correspondence which showed he intended to seek support from the Irish Catholic Confederation through the Cessation Treaty, and Catholic nations in Europe. By publishing this correspondence, entitled &quot;The King&#x27;s Cabinet Opened&quot;, Parliament gained much support in favour of fighting the war to a finish. Within a year, the first civil war ended in a Parliamentarian military victory.

<text>Infectious mononucleosis (IM, mono), also known as glandular fever, is an infection usually caused by the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces few or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, and fatigue. Most people recover in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen, and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur.

While usually caused by the Epstein–Barr virus, also known as human herpesvirus 4, which is a member of the herpesvirus family, a few other viruses and the protozoon &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; may also cause the disease. It is primarily spread through saliva but can rarely be spread through semen or blood. Spread may occur by objects such as drinking glasses or toothbrushes or through a cough or sneeze. Those who are infected can spread the disease weeks before symptoms develop. Mono is primarily diagnosed based on the symptoms and can be confirmed with blood tests for specific antibodies. Another typical finding is increased blood lymphocytes of which more than 10% are reactive. The monospot test is not recommended for general use due to poor accuracy.

There is no vaccine for EBV; however, there is ongoing research. Infection can be prevented by not sharing personal items or saliva with an infected person. Mono generally improves without any specific treatment. Symptoms may be reduced by drinking enough fluids, getting sufficient rest, and taking pain medications such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen.

Mononucleosis most commonly affects those between the ages of 15 and 24 years in the developed world. In the developing world, people are more often infected in early childhood when there are fewer symptoms. In those between 16 and 20 it is the cause of about 8% of sore throats. About 45 out of 100,000 people develop infectious mono each year in the United States. Nearly 95% of people have had an EBV infection by the time they are adults. The disease occurs equally at all times of the year. Mononucleosis was first described in the 1920s and is colloquially known as &quot;the kissing disease&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==


The signs and symptoms of infectious mononucleosis vary with age.

===Children===
Before puberty, the disease typically only produces flu-like symptoms, if any at all. When found, symptoms tend to be similar to those of common throat infections (mild pharyngitis, with or without tonsillitis).

Denis Burkitt reckoned that 18 per 100,000 children every year are infected with Burkitts’s lymphoma (Epstein-Barr virus). This usually causes a violent tumor in children. 

===Adolescents and young adults===
In adolescence and young adulthood, the disease presents with a characteristic triad:
* Fever – usually lasting 14 days; often mild.
* Sore throat – usually severe for 3–5 days, before resolving in the next 7–10 days.
* Swollen glands –  mobile; usually located around the back of the neck (posterior cervical lymph nodes) and sometimes throughout the body.

Another major symptom is feeling tired. Headaches are common, and abdominal pains with nausea or vomiting sometimes also occur. Symptoms most often disappear after about 2–4 weeks. However, fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell (malaise) may sometimes last for months. Fatigue lasts more than one month in an estimated 28% of cases. Mild fever, swollen neck glands and body aches may also persist beyond 4 weeks. Most people are able to resume their usual activities within 2–3 months.

The most prominent sign of the disease is often pharyngitis, which is frequently accompanied by enlarged tonsils with pus—an exudate similar to that seen in cases of strep throat. In about 50% of cases, small reddish-purple spots called petechiae can be seen on the roof of the mouth. Palatal enanthem can also occur, but is relatively uncommon.

A small minority of people spontaneously present a rash, usually on the arms or trunk, which can be macular (morbilliform) or papular. Almost all people given amoxicillin or ampicillin eventually develop a generalized, itchy maculopapular rash, which however does not imply that the person will have adverse reactions to penicillins again in the future. Occasional cases of erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme have been reported. Seizures may also occasionally occur.

===Complications===
Spleen enlargement is common in the second and third weeks, although this may not be apparent on physical examination. Rarely the spleen may rupture. There may also be some enlargement of the liver. Jaundice occurs only occasionally.

It generally gets better on its own in people who are otherwise healthy. When caused by EBV, infectious mononucleosis is classified as one of the Epstein–Barr virus–associated lymphoproliferative diseases. Occasionally the disease may persist and result in a chronic infection. This may develop into systemic EBV-positive T cell lymphoma.

===Older adults===
Infectious mononucleosis mainly affects younger adults. When older adults do catch the disease, they less often have characteristic signs and symptoms such as the sore throat and lymphadenopathy. Instead, they may primarily experience prolonged fever, fatigue, malaise and body pains. They are more likely to have liver enlargement and jaundice. People over 40 years of age are more likely to develop serious illness.

===Incubation period===
The exact length of time between infection and symptoms is unclear. A review of the literature made an estimate of 33–49 days. In adolescents and young adults, symptoms are thought to appear around 4–6 weeks after initial infection. Onset is often gradual, though it can be abrupt. The main symptoms may be preceded by 1–2 weeks of fatigue, feeling unwell and body aches.

==Cause==

===Epstein–Barr virus===

About 90% of cases of infectious mononucleosis are caused by the Epstein–Barr virus, a member of the Herpesviridae family of DNA viruses. It is one of the most commonly found viruses throughout the world. Contrary to common belief, the Epstein–Barr virus is not highly contagious. It can only be contracted through direct contact with an infected person&#x27;s saliva, such as through kissing or sharing toothbrushes. About 95% of the population has been exposed to this virus by the age of 40, but only 15–20% of teenagers and about 40% of exposed adults actually develop infectious mononucleosis.

===Cytomegalovirus===

About 5–7% of cases of infectious mononucleosis is caused by human cytomegalovirus (CMV), another type of herpes virus. This virus is found in body fluids including saliva, urine, blood, tears, breast milk and genital secretions. A person becomes infected with this virus by direct contact with infected body fluids. Cytomegalovirus is most commonly transmitted through kissing and sexual intercourse. It can also be transferred from an infected mother to her unborn child. This virus is often &quot;silent&quot; because the signs and symptoms cannot be felt by the person infected. However, it can cause life-threatening illness in infants, people with HIV, transplant recipients, and those with weak immune systems. For those with weak immune systems, cytomegalovirus can cause more serious illnesses such as pneumonia and inflammations of the retina, esophagus, liver, large intestine, and brain. Approximately 90% of the human population has been infected with cytomegalovirus by the time they reach adulthood, but most are unaware of the infection. Once a person becomes infected with cytomegalovirus, the virus stays in their body throughout the person&#x27;s lifetime. During this latent phase, the virus can be detected only in monocytes.

===Other causes===
Toxoplasma gondii, a parasitic protozoon, is responsible for less than 1% of the infectious mononucleosis cases. Viral hepatitis, adenovirus, rubella, and herpes simplex viruses have also been reported as rare causes of infectious mononucleosis.

===Transmission===
Epstein–Barr virus infection is spread via saliva, and has an incubation period of four to seven weeks. The length of time that an individual remains contagious is unclear, but the chances of passing the illness to someone else may be the highest during the first six weeks following infection. Some studies indicate that a person can spread the infection for many months, possibly up to a year and a half.

==Pathophysiology==
The virus replicates first within epithelial cells in the pharynx (which causes pharyngitis, or sore throat), and later primarily within B cells (which are invaded via their CD21). The host immune response involves cytotoxic (CD8-positive) T cells against infected B lymphocytes, resulting in enlarged, reactive lymphocytes (Downey cells).

When the infection is acute (recent onset, instead of chronic), heterophile antibodies are produced.

Cytomegalovirus, adenovirus and &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; (toxoplasmosis) infections can cause symptoms similar to infectious mononucleosis, but a heterophile antibody test will test negative and differentiate those infections from infectious mononucleosis.

Mononucleosis is sometimes accompanied by secondary cold agglutinin disease, an autoimmune disease in which abnormal circulating antibodies directed against red blood cells can lead to a form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The cold agglutinin detected is of anti-i specificity.

==Diagnosis==


The disease is diagnosed based on:

===Physical examination===
The presence of an enlarged spleen, and swollen posterior cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes are the most useful to suspect a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. On the other hand, the absence of swollen cervical lymph nodes and fatigue are the most useful to dismiss the idea of infectious mononucleosis as the correct diagnosis. The insensitivity of the physical examination in detecting an enlarged spleen means it should not be used as evidence against infectious mononucleosis. A physical examination may also show petechiae in the palate.

===Heterophile antibody test===

The heterophile antibody test, or monospot test, works by agglutination of red blood cells from guinea pigs, sheep and horses. This test is specific but not particularly sensitive (with a false-negative rate of as high as 25% in the first week, 5–10% in the second, and 5% in the third). About 90% of diagnosed people have heterophile antibodies by week 3, disappearing in under a year. The antibodies involved in the test do not interact with the Epstein–Barr virus or any of its antigens.

The monospot test is not recommended for general use by the CDC due to its poor accuracy.

===Serology===
Serologic tests detect antibodies directed against the Epstein–Barr virus. Immunoglobulin G (IgG), when positive, mainly reflects a past infection, whereas immunoglobulin M (IgM) mainly reflects a current infection. EBV-targeting antibodies can also be classified according to which part of the virus they bind to:
* Viral capsid antigen (VCA):
:*Anti-VCA IgM appear early after infection, and usually, disappear within 4 to 6 weeks.
:*Anti-VCA IgG appears in the acute phase of EBV infection, reaches a maximum at 2 to 4 weeks after onset of symptoms and thereafter declines slightly and persists for the rest of a person’s life.
* Early antigen (EA)
:*Anti-EA IgG appears in the acute phase of illness and disappears after 3 to 6 months. It is associated with having an active infection. Yet, 20% of people may have antibodies against EA for years despite having no other sign of infection.
* EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)
:*Antibody to EBNA slowly appears 2 to 4 months after the onset of symptoms and persists for the rest of a person’s life.

When negative, these tests are more accurate than the heterophile antibody test in ruling out infectious mononucleosis. When positive, they feature similar specificity to the heterophile antibody test. Therefore, these tests are useful for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis in people with highly suggestive symptoms and a negative heterophile antibody test.

===Other tests===
* Elevated hepatic transaminase levels are highly suggestive of infectious mononucleosis, occurring in up to 50% of people.
* By blood film, one diagnostic criterion for infectious mononucleosis is the presence of 50% lymphocytes with at least 10% reactive lymphocytes (large, irregular nuclei), while the person also has fever, pharyngitis, and swollen lymph nodes. The reactive lymphocytes resembled monocytes when they were first discovered, thus the term &quot;mononucleosis&quot; was coined.
* A fibrin ring granuloma may be present in the liver or bone marrow.

===Differential diagnosis===
About 10% of people who present a clinical picture of infectious mononucleosis do not have an acute Epstein–Barr-virus infection. A differential diagnosis of acute infectious mononucleosis needs to take into consideration acute cytomegalovirus infection and &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; infections. Because their management is much the same, it is not always helpful–or possible–to distinguish between Epstein–Barr-virus mononucleosis and cytomegalovirus infection. However, in pregnant women, differentiation of mononucleosis from toxoplasmosis is important, since it is associated with significant consequences for the fetus.

Acute HIV infection can mimic signs similar to those of infectious mononucleosis, and tests should be performed for pregnant women for the same reason as toxoplasmosis.

People with infectious mononucleosis are sometimes misdiagnosed with a streptococcal pharyngitis (because of the symptoms of fever, pharyngitis and adenopathy) and are given antibiotics such as ampicillin or amoxicillin as treatment.

Other conditions from which to distinguish infectious mononucleosis include leukemia, tonsillitis, diphtheria, common cold and influenza (flu).

==Treatment==
Infectious mononucleosis is generally self-limiting, so only symptomatic or supportive treatments are used. The need for rest and return to usual activities after the acute phase of the infection may reasonably be based on the person&#x27;s general energy levels. Nevertheless, in an effort to decrease the risk of splenic rupture, experts advise avoidance of contact sports and other heavy physical activity, especially when involving increased abdominal pressure or the Valsalva maneuver (as in rowing or weight training), for at least the first 3–4 weeks of illness or until enlargement of the spleen has resolved, as determined by a treating physician.

===Medications===

Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may be used to reduce fever and pain. Prednisone, a corticosteroid, while used to try to reduce throat pain or enlarged tonsils, remains controversial due to the lack of evidence that it is effective and the potential for side effects. Intravenous corticosteroids, usually hydrocortisone or dexamethasone, are not recommended for routine use but may be useful if there is a risk of airway obstruction, a very low platelet count, or hemolytic anemia.
Antiviral agents act by inhibiting viral DNA replication. There is little evidence to support the use of antivirals such as aciclovir and valacyclovir although they may reduce initial viral shedding. Antivirals are expensive, risk causing resistance to antiviral agents, and (in 1% to 10% of cases) can cause unpleasant side effects. Although antivirals are not recommended for people with simple infectious mononucleosis, they may be useful (in conjunction with steroids) in the management of severe EBV manifestations, such as EBV meningitis, peripheral neuritis, hepatitis, or hematologic complications.
Although antibiotics exert no antiviral action they may be indicated to treat bacterial secondary infections of the throat, such as with streptococcus (strep throat). However, ampicillin and amoxicillin are not recommended during acute Epstein–Barr virus infection as a diffuse rash may develop.

===Observation===
Splenomegaly is a common symptom of infectious mononucleosis and health care providers may consider using abdominal ultrasonography to get insight into the enlargement of a person&#x27;s spleen. However, because spleen size varies greatly, ultrasonography is not a valid technique for assessing spleen enlargement and should not be used in typical circumstances or to make routine decisions about fitness for playing sports.

==Prognosis==
Serious complications are uncommon, occurring in less than 5% of cases:
* CNS complications include meningitis, encephalitis, hemiplegia, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis. Prior infectious mononucleosis has been linked to the development of multiple sclerosis.
* Hematologic: Hemolytic anemia (direct Coombs test is positive) and various cytopenias, and bleeding (caused by thrombocytopenia) can occur.
* Mild jaundice
* Hepatitis with the Epstein–Barr virus is rare.
* Upper airway obstruction from tonsillar hypertrophy is rare.
* Fulminant disease course of immunocompromised people are rare.
* Splenic rupture is rare.
* Myocarditis and pericarditis are rare.
* Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
* Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome
* Cancers associated with the Epstein–Barr virus include Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma, Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma and lymphomas in general as well as nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinoma.
* Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis

Once the acute symptoms of an initial infection disappear, they often do not return. But once infected, the person carries the virus for the rest of their life. The virus typically lives dormant in B lymphocytes. Independent infections of mononucleosis may be contracted multiple times, regardless of whether the person is already carrying the virus dormant. Periodically, the virus can reactivate, during which time the person is again infectious, but usually without any symptoms of illness. Usually, a person with IM has few, if any, further symptoms or problems from the latent B lymphocyte infection. However, in susceptible hosts under the appropriate environmental stressors, the virus can reactivate and cause vague physical symptoms (or may be subclinical), and during this phase, the virus can spread to others.

==History==

The characteristic symptomatology of infectious mononucleosis does not appear to have been reported until the late nineteenth century. In 1885, the renowned Russian pediatrician Nil Filatov reported an infectious process he called &quot;idiopathic adenitis&quot; exhibiting symptoms that correspond to infectious mononucleosis, and in 1889 a German balneologist and pediatrician, Emil Pfeiffer, independently reported similar cases (some of lesser severity) that tended to cluster in families, for which he coined the term &quot;Drüsenfieber&quot; (&quot;glandular fever&quot;).

The word &quot;mononucleosis&quot; has several senses, but today it usually is used in the sense of infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by EBV.

Around the 1920’s , infectious mononucleosis was not known and there were not many things to test whether people were infected or not. Before this there weren&#x27;t many cases disclosed besides a few and one of these would take place in 1896. This outbreak infected an Ohio community which ended leaving them devastated. Epidemics seemed to keep reappearing here and there including an outbreak that happened in which 87 people were infected in the Falcon Islands. Some other outbreaks that occurred around this time would include some nurseries and boarding schools and also the U.S. Naval Base, Coronado, Calif,  where hundreds were infected by this virus. 

The term &quot;infectious mononucleosis&quot; was coined in 1920 by Thomas Peck Sprunt and Frank Alexander Evans in a classic clinical description of the disease published in the &quot;Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital&quot;, entitled &quot;Mononuclear leukocytosis in reaction to acute infection (infectious mononucleosis)&quot;. A lab test for infectious mononucleosis was developed in 1931 by Yale School of Public Health Professor John Rodman Paul and Walls Willard Bunnell based on their discovery of heterophile antibodies in the sera of persons with the disease. The Paul-Bunnell Test or PBT was later replaced by the heterophile antibody test.

The Epstein–Barr virus was first identified in Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma cells by Michael Anthony Epstein and Yvonne Barr at the University of Bristol in 1964. The link with infectious mononucleosis was uncovered in 1967 by Werner and Gertrude Henle at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia, after a laboratory technician handling the virus contracted the disease: comparison of serum samples collected from the technician before and after the onset revealed development of antibodies to the virus.

Yale School of Public Health epidemiologist Alfred E. Evans confirmed through testing that mononucleosis was transmitted mainly through kissing, leading to it being referred to colloquially as &quot;the kissing disease&quot;.

<text>Tijuana International Airport (); officially &quot;Aeropuerto Internacional General Abelardo L. Rodríguez&quot; (General [[Abelardo L. Rodríguez]] International Airport) , is an international airport located northeast of downtown Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. It serves Tijuana and the surrounding San Diego–Tijuana metropolitan area, home to a population of five million people.

The airport serves a network of 42 domestic destinations including most of the major and secondary cities across Mexico. It is a hub for Volaris and a focus city for Viva. Additionally, the airport houses facilities for the Mexican Air Force and supports cargo flights, tourism, flight training, and general aviation activities. It is Mexico&#x27;s westernmost airport and second-northernmost airport after Mexicali International Airport. The airport is operated by Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico.

Situated adjacent to the Mexico–United States border, Tijuana Airport is a geographically binational airport, having direct access to its terminal from Mexico, and from its Cross Border Xpress (CBX) terminal in the United States. This rare feature allows passengers with a boarding pass to walk across a bridge crossing the border. The CBX terminal handled more than 4 million passengers in 2024, approximately one-third of all passenger movements at Tijuana Airport.

The airport ranks as the fifth busiest airport in Mexico for both passenger numbers and aircraft movements, and holds the 16th position in Latin America and the 47th position in North America. It has witnessed significant growth, handling 8,925,900 passengers in 2019 and reaching 12,545,800 passengers in 2024. In 2022, Tijuana International Airport became the fifth airport in the country to surpass ten million passengers in a calendar year.

==History==

=== Early years ===

Tijuana Airport, inaugurated as the &#x27;&quot;Aeropuerto Federal de Tijuana&quot;&#x27; on May 1, 1951, replaced the former airport located on today&#x27;s &quot;Aguacaliente Boulevard&quot;. The initial passenger terminal was situated on the southwest side of the airport grounds, facing the present terminal. In 1954, Mexicana de Aviación began direct flights from Tijuana to Mexico City. In 1965, as part of the National Plan of Airports introduced during President Diaz Ordaz&#x27;s administration, the airport became part of the Government-owned corporation Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA). The growing population in Tijuana during the 1960s led to an increased demand for flights.

The airport&#x27;s long runway, with an orientation of 10/28, had its northern end located less than south of the U.S. border wall. This meant that departing airplanes entered U.S. airspace after takeoff. The year 1969 marked the introduction of Operation Intercept, aimed at curbing narcotics flow between the U.S. and Mexico. Rising political pressure to reduce incursions into U.S. airspace resulted in the requirement to reorient the runway from 10/28 to 09/27.

In 1970, a new long runway (09/27) and a terminal capable of accommodating larger aircraft were constructed north of the existing runway. The new runway direction impacted Tijuana&#x27;s approach, particularly over &quot;Cerro San Isidro&quot;, a high land obstacle, causing an increase in the east approach glide slope beyond 3 degrees and hindering a full Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach on runway 27, necessary during adverse weather conditions.

The original terminal then transitioned into an air base for the Mexican Air Force, now known as the &#x27;&quot;Aeropuerto Viejo&quot;&#x27; or old airport. During the 1970s, Tijuana experienced rapid growth, leading to expansions in both terminal and parking areas to meet escalating airport demand.

=== Privatization ===
In the 1980s, both terminal space and passenger parking at Tijuana Airport became insufficient to meet demand. In 1990, Mexico initiated its first two 10-year joint ventures with private investors. One of the initial projects involved expanding both the departure concourse and parking areas.

The year 1995 marked a significant change with the publication of the &quot;&#x27;Ley de Aeropuertos&quot;&#x27; (Airports Law) by the Department of Communications and Transportation &quot;(Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transporte)&quot;, marking the beginning of Mexico&#x27;s airport privatization program. In 1999, Tijuana Airport joined Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico (GAP), a consortium headquartered in Guadalajara. This consortium included Spanish investors Unión Fenosa, Dragados, and Aeropuertos Españoles y Navegación Aérea (AENA), along with Mexican strategic investor Grupo Empresarial Ángeles, managing a total of 12 airports.

Under the airport privatization concession in 2002, an expansion project was undertaken by the airport management. The extension of concourses A and B allowed for a doubling of the terminal&#x27;s capacity. Furthermore, several taxiways were expanded to accommodate larger aircraft, such as the Boeing 747.
=== Growth and hub years ===

Throughout its history, Tijuana Airport has served as a strategic hub for various airlines. In the 1990s, up until its discontinuation of services in 2006, Aero California utilized the airport as a hub, offering services to over 12 domestic cities. Other airlines such as TAESA, Aerolíneas Internacionales, Líneas Aéreas Azteca, and Avolar also established their hubs in Tijuana during the 1990s and early 2000s, operating extensive domestic networks. Notably, Avolar had its maintenance base at a large hangar facility in Tijuana, later acquired by Volaris. Volaris initiated operations in Tijuana in 2006, gradually expanding its services and transforming Tijuana into a hub with connections to more than 35 destinations.

As the airport grew in significance, emerging as one of the country&#x27;s largest hubs, plans for a new terminal were contemplated, though no tangible progress has been made. Between 2011 and 2012, significant renovations occurred in the passenger terminal, particularly in Concourses A and B. These enhancements included the establishment of new customs and international arrivals facilities and the construction of a new bus terminal.

=== Binational operations ===

On December 9, 2015, the Cross Border Xpress (CBX) was officially opened, establishing a physical connection between the passenger terminal in Tijuana and a new terminal in San Diego. This innovative project facilitates seamless passenger crossings between the two countries, effectively transforming Tijuana Airport into a geographically binational airport with direct access from both Mexico and the United States. The realization of this project follows decades of planning and negotiations, addressing aspects such as border control, management, funding, and construction. Notably, on December 19, 2015, the airport experienced its busiest day, recording a total of 164 flights between departures and arrivals.

The airport&#x27;s proximity to the U.S. border makes it an appealing option for cross-border travelers heading to Mexican cities. However, due to its close proximity to San Diego International Airport and the high transportation taxes for international flights in Mexico, the airport has not been able to retain international destinations. Passengers traveling to destinations in the United States and abroad typically choose to use San Diego International Airport, which is situated less than northwest of Tijuana Airport.

In 2022, an expansion of the passenger terminal was constructed. Named &quot;&#x27;Nuevo Edificio Procesador&quot;&#x27; (New Processing Building), it features additional check-in counters, security lanes, boarding gates, and immigration facilities for both international flights and cross-border passengers entering from San Diego. The expansion aims to attract flight services to Asia and South America, with the goal of turning Tijuana Airport into a convenient alternative to U.S. airports for connecting passengers traveling between the two continents. Future plans for the airport include the addition of a hotel and a new bus terminal.

== Routes evolution ==

In 1954, Mexicana de Aviación introduced direct flights from Tijuana to Mexico City. During the &#x27;70s, the cargo airline AeroCarga offered flights from Tijuana to La Paz, Mexico City, and Mérida, utilizing a fleet of Douglas DC-6 aircraft. In 1971, Aeroméxico initiated flights to Mexico City with Douglas DC-8 equipment, and by 1976, it expanded its services with McDonnell Douglas DC-10 equipment to Guadalajara and Mexico City. Mexicana reinaugurated its Tijuana flights in 1978, operating a daily flight from Mexico City with a stop in La Paz, using Boeing 727 equipment.

In 1983, Aero California launched the Tijuana-Los Mochis-Guadalajara route with McDonnell Douglas DC-9 jets. Mexicana inaugurated the Guadalajara route in 1985, operating various aircraft, including Boeing 727, Boeing 757, Airbus A318, Airbus A319, and Airbus A320, over a span of 25 years. In the summer of 1987, Aeroméxico introduced flights to Bogotá, Colombia, utilizing Douglas DC-8-62 equipment on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. However, in 1988, Aeroméxico faced a crisis, declaring bankruptcy and undergoing restructuring, which impacted its services in Tijuana. In 1991, TAESA initiated flights to Mexico City with a stop in Los Mochis, employing Boeing 727 equipment.

In 2006, Aeroméxico launched the Tijuana-Acapulco route, utilizing Boeing 737-700 aircraft. The same year, Líneas Aéreas Azteca initiated flights to Oakland. Viva Aerobus began operations in Tijuana from its Monterrey hub in 2006, operating Boeing 737-300 equipment. Interjet introduced flights to Mexico City in 2008. In 2009, Mexicana closed routes to Culiacán and Puebla, ultimately declaring bankruptcy in 2010. From 2006 until September 2014, Aeroméxico operated three weekly flights to Tokyo-Narita with a Boeing 777-200, but in September 2014, these flights were relocated to Monterrey. Additionally, Aeroméxico provided services to Shanghai from 2006 to 2009 and then again from 2010 to 2019.

In 2012, regional airline Calafia Airlines initiated bi-weekly flights to Tijuana, following the route Tijuana-Loreto-La Paz. Viva Aerobus temporarily suspended its operations in Tijuana in 2014. Interjet started operations on the Acapulco-Tijuana-Acapulco route in 2015, utilizing the Sukhoi Superjet 100. On March 4, 2015, Volaris resumed the Tijuana-Oakland route, offering 2 flights per week. Initially launched in August 2009 and operating daily, the route was canceled due to poor results.

On October 1, 2015, Aeroméxico Connect resumed flights from Tijuana to Monterrey, operated by the Embraer 170. Viva Aerobus also resumed its flights in Tijuana on November 19, 2015, with Mexico City as its first route, marking the beginning of its current operating base and focus city service.

From 2017 to 2018, Volaris Costa Rica initiated flights to San Salvador and Guatemala City. In 2018, the Chinese airline Hainan Airlines commenced three weekly flights from Beijing to Tijuana and Mexico City using Boeing 787-8 equipment. This service was put on hiatus in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Interjet also ceased all operations in Tijuana that year after filing for bankruptcy and becoming defunct.

On December 26th, 2023, newly incorporated state-owned airline Aerolínea del Estado Mexicano (operating under the name Mexicana de Aviación, in honor of the defunct airline) commenced daily flights to Tijuana using Boeing 737 equipment from the Mexican Air Force. The airline used to operate flights twice a day, however one of the two designated flights was abruptly terminated. The airline now operates daily flights once a day.

From 2020 to 2023, the airport had no international service due to the pandemic imposing heavier restrictions on air travel. After the pandemic officially ended, restrictions were lifted and international service officially resumed on February 15, 2024, with American Eagle launching daily flights to Phoenix, Arizona using Embraer E175 equipment. This marks the first direct connection to the airport managed by American Eagle.

On May 11th, 2024, China Southern Airlines launched the bi-weekly Shenzhen-Mexico City route, using Airbus A350 equipment. The flight departs from Shenzhen and flies directly to Mexico City’s busiest airport with no stops. When returning to Shenzhen, it stops at Tijuana’s airport as a layover mostly to refuel. Since the flight currently only flies to the airport as a layover, passengers inside the airplane are not allowed to exit the aircraft and must wait until landing at Shenzhen, their final and intended destination. Likewise, passengers at the terminal are not allowed to board the plane either. However, it is worth mentioning that China Southern Airlines is considering adding Tijuana to its route, allowing passengers to board and de-board the plane at the airport. If this route is implemented, it would be the airport’s first direct connection managed by China Southern Airlines. It would also be the airport’s second direct connection to China and, consequently, Asia.

On July 12th, 2024, after a four-year hiatus, Hainan Airlines resumed its Beijing-Tijuana-Mexico City / Mexico City-Tijuana-Beijing route, retaining the three weekly flights and using the same Boeing 787-8 equipment it used to operate before the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant the airport had now officially resumed direct passenger connections with Asia and it now had the only direct passenger connection to China in the San Diego–Tijuana metropolitan area.

On October 29th, 2024, Volaris initiated direct flights to Las Vegas. This flight operates three times a week and is currently the airport’s second direct connection to the United States and its third international destination overall.

Volaris remains as the largest operator in the airport, offering flights to more than 35 domestic destinations. Additionally, along with Viva, it serves the longest domestic non-stop route in Mexico, from Tijuana to Cancún, with a flight time of over 4 hours.

== Facilities ==

The airport features a single long 09/27 runway, a parallel taxiway, and an apron with 23 parking positions, mostly arranged for narrow-body commercial aircraft surrounding the two terminal pier buildings. There are 12 positions with direct access to the terminal and 11 remote positions. Adjacent to this area, there is a general aviation apron offering stands for fixed-wing aircraft and heliports for private aviation, as well as hangars and maintenance facilities. The airport features a high-tech control tower, one of the tallest in Mexico.

On the opposite side of the Main Terminal building, there is another terminal, the Old Airport Terminal, and a former runway. The Old Airport Terminal houses military facilities, and south of the former runway, 4 remote positions are located, mostly used by cargo airliners. These are linked by a shorter taxiway to the main runway. The airport is also used to a lesser extent for general aviation, housed at the General Aviation Building (GAB).

Runway 09/27 runs east–west approximately south of the U.S.-Mexico border. The approach to the runway is either from the east (normally) or from the west (when Santa Ana wind conditions exist). Due to prevailing winds, the 27 runway is Tijuana&#x27;s main approach pattern. The airport can handle up to 10 million passengers per year and 360 flights per day. It is capable of handling widebody aircraft such as the Boeing 787 and 747.

=== Passenger Terminal ===
The passenger terminal accommodates both arrival and departure services for domestic and international flights within a multi-story building, including two pier concourses with 20 gates. The ground floor of the main building includes check-in areas and an arrivals section featuring a baggage claim area and an arrivals hall. Here, passengers can access car rental services, taxi stands, snack bars, and souvenir shops. The first floor houses the main hall, which features a security checkpoint and an airside corridor leading to Concourses A and B. This zone is equipped with food stands, duty-free shops, and a VIP lounge. The gates are located in two piers, designated A and B, which are connected to the main terminal. It is designed so that international flights can be handled at Concourse B and domestic flights at both concourses. Additionally, gates 19 and 20 are located at the east end of the terminal, where passengers board their aircraft directly from the apron.

Concourse A serves domestic flights and features sitting areas with shops and food stands. It has nine gates: gates 1-5 are located on the top floor and are equipped with jet bridges, while gates 6-9 are located on the ground floor, where passengers board their aircraft directly from the apron. Airlines operating from this satellite include Aeromexico, Volaris, Magnicharters, and Calafia Airlines.

Concourse B serves domestic and international flights. It features the same layout as Concourse A with sitting areas, food stands, and duty-free shops. This concourse features eight gates: gates 10-14 are located on the top floor and are equipped with jet bridges, while gates 15-18 are located on the ground floor, where passengers board their aircraft directly from the apron. Airlines operating from Concourse B include Aeromexico, Viva, Volaris, and from 2024, American Eagle.

The top floor of the terminal houses international arrivals corridors and the entrance vestibule for passengers coming from the Cross Border Xpress (CBX) terminal in San Diego. The vestibule leads to a Mexican immigration and customs facility and a check-in area for international passengers.

=== Cross Border Xpress CBX ===

The Cross Border Xpress (CBX), also known as the Cross-Border Terminal, is a terminal located in southern San Diego, California, adjacent to the Mexican border, serving approximately one-third of Tijuana Airport&#x27;s passengers. It uniquely positions Tijuana Airport as a geographically binational airport. The CBX comprises a terminal building physically located on U.S. soil, adjacent to the border, and a bridge across the border connecting to the Mexican immigration and customs facilities at Tijuana Airport. It facilitates direct access for U.S. passengers to Tijuana Airport and provides Mexican and international carriers with direct entry to the U.S. market.

The building serves departure and arrival facilities. Departing passengers can enter the building on the U.S. side before crossing the pedestrian bridge over the border, clearing immigration and customs, and boarding flights in the departure concourses in Tijuana. Arrival passengers in Tijuana can access the bridge from the baggage claim area at the terminal in Tijuana and walk across the border into U.S. customs and immigration facilities at the CBX terminal.

The building&#x27;s design is the work of the late Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta. Its central articulator node, dividing flows and functions, is a purple open central courtyard with an ash tree and a reflecting pool, referencing vernacular Mexican architecture. The arrivals hall features car rental facilities, bus agencies, and a snack bar.

The concept of a cross-border terminal was initially proposed in the 1960s as part of a broader plan to modernize Mexico&#x27;s airports. Despite multiple developments and setbacks, construction commenced in 2013. With an initial estimated cost of US$78 million and a final completion cost of US$120 million, it officially opened on December 9, 2015. Building E, which hosts the parking facilities at Tijuana&#x27;s Terminal underwent restructuring to support the new bridge&#x27;s structure. The project received accolades for its design and innovation and has undergone renovations and additions, including a new restroom facility and duty-free area completed in 2020.

===Other facilities===

The General Aviation Building (GAB) is used for general/non-commercial aviation or private jets. The GAB is designed to receive up to 120 persons per hour and has all the services for the convenience of passengers during their private flights. It covers a surface area of , housing government offices, administrative offices, a pilots lounge, and a passenger lounge. Two aviation schools are based at this terminal, along with one cargo airline operating there.

Brown Field Municipal Airport (SDM) in San Diego, California lies just over north of the airport, with a similar runway length and orientation. SDM is a general aviation field not set up for scheduled passenger service. Both SDM and TIJ are designated as ports of entry for their respective countries.

Air Force Base Nr. 12 () (B.A.M. No. 12) is a facility of the Mexican Air Force located on the airport grounds. Currently, it does not have an assigned air squadron. It has an aviation platform of , one hangar, and other facilities for the accommodation of air force personnel. These facilities are located at The Old Airport Terminal.

===Bus===
The airport may be reached from Downtown Tijuana or Zona Rio by local bus. It costs $11.00 MXN (US$0.60).

===Shuttle===
Volaris provides a shuttle service from San Diego, California, to Tijuana Airport, allowing San Diego residents to make connections within Mexico. Passengers cannot board this shuttle at San Diego International Airport but instead take a local bus from the airport to the Amtrak Station at 1050 Kettner Blvd. on the corner of Broadway Ave, Downtown San Diego, CA 92101. There is no equivalent shuttle from Tijuana Airport back to downtown San Diego, as most people who connect between Tijuana Airport and San Diego pay to use the Cross Border Xpress and then take private vehicles or use Uber or taxi services since there is no public transportation from CBX.

===Taxi===
Due to a prohibition by Mexican law, public taxis from Mexican cities may drop passengers at the airport but cannot pick up passengers from the terminal. The airport, therefore, offers transportation for passengers from the terminal to any point in the city on SAAT Taxis &quot;Servicio Aeroportuario de Autotransporte Terrestre&quot; (Terrestrial Transport Airport Service), an airport government-leased taxi company. This and other authorized taxi carriers may be reached at the arrivals hall. This inflates taxi prices, forcing passengers to either pay them or walk outside the airport.
