<text>A beauty pageant is a competition in which the contestants are judged and ranked based on various physical and mental attributes. Per its name, beauty pageants traditionally focus on judging the contestants&#x27; physical attractiveness, sometimes solely so, but most modern beauty pageants have since expanded to also judge contestants based on &quot;inner beauty&quot;—their individual traits and characteristics, including personality, intelligence, aptitude, moral character, and charity. Though typically perceived as a female-oriented competition, male beauty pageants also exist, as do child beauty pageants for youth.

The term beauty pageant refers originally to the Big Four beauty pageants: Miss Universe, Miss World, Miss International, and Miss Earth. Hundreds and thousands of beauty contests are held annually, but the Big Four are considered the most prestigious, and are widely covered and broadcast by news media. The earliest formal beauty pageants were held in the 19th century, although similar informal events date back to at least the post-classical period. Modern beauty pageants were first established in the early 20th century, with their popularity later boosted by the establishment of international pageants in the mid-20th century. Reforms of pageants in the 21st century marked a shift from primarily focusing on physical appearance to placing more weight on other characteristics.

Beauty pageants are generally multi-tiered, with local competitions feeding into the larger competitions; for example, the international pageants have hundreds or thousands of local competitions. The organizers of each pageant may determine the competition rules, including the age range of contestants. The rules may also require the contestants to be unmarried, and be virtuous, amateur, and available for promotions, besides other criteria. It may also set the clothing standards in which contestants will be judged, including such as formal wear, swimsuit, sportswear, or designer clothing. Possible awards of beauty contests include titles, tiaras, crowns, sashes, bouquets, scepters, savings bonds, scholarships, and prize money. The winner of a beauty contest is generally called a beauty queen for female pageants and a beauty king for male pageants. Pageant titles are often subdivided into Miss, Mrs. or Ms., and Teen, to clearly identify the difference between pageant divisions. The rankings of the contestants are referred to as &quot;placements&quot;.

== History ==
===Early history===

European festivals dating back to the Middle Ages provide the most direct lineage for beauty pageants. For example, English May Day celebrations always had the selection of a May Queen. In the United States, the May Day tradition of selecting a woman to serve as a symbol of beauty and community ideals continued, as young, beautiful women participated in public celebrations.

A beauty pageant was held during the Eglinton Tournament of 1839, organized by Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton, as part of a re-enactment of a medieval joust that was held in Scotland. The pageant was won by Georgiana Seymour, Duchess of Somerset, the wife of Edward Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset, and sister of Caroline Norton, and she was proclaimed as the &quot;Queen of Beauty&quot;. Beauty contests became more popular in the 1880s. In 1888, the title of &#x27;beauty queen&#x27; was awarded to an 18-year-old Creole contestant at a pageant in Spa, Belgium. All participants had to supply a photograph and a short description of themselves to be eligible to enter and a final selection of 21 was judged by a formal panel. Such events were not regarded as respectable. In 1880, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware held the first recorded beauty pageant in the United States, searching for &quot;the most beautiful unmarried woman in our nation&quot; and awarding her the title of Miss United States.

===National and international pageants===

Beauty contests came to be considered more respectable with the first modern &quot;Miss America&quot; contest held in 1921. The oldest pageant still in operation today is the Miss America pageant, which was organized in 1921 by a local businessman to entice tourists to Atlantic City, New Jersey. The pageant hosted the winners of local newspaper beauty contests in the &quot;Inter-City Beauty&quot; Contest, attended by over one hundred thousand people. Sixteen-year-old Margaret Gorman of Washington, D.C., was crowned Miss America 1921, having won both the popularity and beauty contests, and was awarded $100.

In May 1920, promoter C.E. Barfield of Galveston, Texas organized a new event known as &quot;Splash Day&quot; on the island. The event featured a &quot;Bathing Girl Revue&quot; competition as the centerpiece of its attractions. The event was the kick-off of the summer tourist season in the city and was carried forward annually. The event quickly became known outside of Texas and, beginning in 1926, the world&#x27;s first international contest was added, known as the International Pageant of Pulchritude. This contest is said to have served as a model for modern pageants. It featured contestants from England, Russia, Turkey, and many other nations and the title awarded at the time was known as &quot;Miss Universe&quot;. The event was discontinued in the United States in 1932 because of the Depression (the international competition was revived briefly in Belgium).

The popularity of the Miss America pageant prompted other organizations to establish similar contests in the 1950s and beyond. Some were significant while others were trivial, such as the National Donut Queen contest. The Miss World contest started in 1951, Miss Universe started in 1952, as did Miss USA. Miss International started in 1960. Miss Asia Pacific International, which started in 1968, is the first and oldest beauty pageant in Asia. The Miss Black America contest started in 1968 in response to the exclusion of African American women from the Miss America pageant. The Miss Universe Organization started the Miss Teen USA in 1983 for the 14–19 age group. Miss Earth started in 2001, which channels the beauty pageant entertainment industry to actively promote the preservation of the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;missearth.tv/about.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These contests continue to this day.

==Major beauty pageants==
Major international contests for women include the yearly Miss World competition (founded by Eric Morley in 1951), Miss Universe (founded in 1952), Miss International (founded in 1960), Miss India Worldwide (founded in 1980) and Miss Earth (founded in 2001 with environmental awareness as its concern). These four are considered the biggest and most well known pageants, the four largest and most famous international beauty contests for single or unmarried women (except Miss Universe).

===Big Four International Beauty Pageants===

==Big Four dethronements and resignations==
Dethronements and resignations are rare for the Big Four pageant winners, but when it does occur, it creates media attention.

The Miss World pageant has had 3 cases of dethronement or resignation instances:
* In 1973, Marjorie Wallace from the United States, who was crowned Miss World and once stated that &quot;as Miss World I can get laid with any man I pick&quot;, dated a string of celebrities including George Best. She was dethroned three months after she was crowned.
* In Miss Universe, Oxana Fedorova of Russia was crowned Miss Universe 2002 and was dethroned four months later, as she was unable to fulfill her obligations. She was the first to be dethroned in the history of Miss Universe. She was replaced by first runner-up Justine Pasek of Panama.
* After being crowned Miss Wales and then Miss United Kingdom, Helen Morgan, competed and won Miss World 1974. However she was discovered to be a mother and was named in a divorce case. This led to her resigning four days after she was crowned. She was replaced by first runner-up of South Africa, Anneline Kriel.
* Gabriela Brum of Germany had the shortest reign in Miss World history when she resigned her title 18 hours after being crowned Miss World 1980. She indicated that her boyfriend disapproved of the contest, but it was later revealed that she had posed for naked photographs; she later relocated to the United States and modelled nude for &quot;Playboy&quot;. Second place Kimberley Santos of Guam replaced Brum by default.

In its early years, there were two instances where the reigning Miss Universe opted to resign from her position: Armi Kuusela, Miss Universe 1952 from Finland, who held the distinction of being the first Miss Universe winner to give up her crown in less than a year to marry Filipino businessman Virgilio Hilario while Amparo Muñoz, Miss Universe 1974 of Spain refused to travel to Japan and instead resigned after six months of her reign. However, since the pageant had no concrete rule on resignation at that time, they were allowed to keep their titles.

In Miss Earth, the 2002 winner, Dzejla Glavovic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was dethroned of her crown six months into her reign, after she failed to show up at several environmental events. According to Carousel Productions, organizer of the Miss Earth contest, Glavovic was dethroned because of &quot;her inability to fulfill the duties and responsibilities as the Miss Earth titleholder, in accordance with the rules and regulations set forth in the Miss Earth contract that she signed.&quot; She was succeeded by first runner-up Winfred Omwakwe of Kenya as Miss Earth 2002.

In Miss International, Ikumi Yoshimatsu, Miss International 2012 was the first titleholder of the pageant from Japan to be dethroned shortly before the end of her reign. She was ordered by the International Culture Association (Miss International organizer) to skip the succession ceremony and &quot;play sick and shut up&quot; out of fear of scandal. The Miss International organizer cited the reason for her dethronement was due to her involvement in a contract dispute with a talent agency in which she claimed that she was pressured to sign by Burning Productions, a film production company which is rumored to be linked with the Japanese underworld, but she refused and went ahead by starting her own company. Yoshimatsu filed criminal charges against one of Japan&#x27;s most powerful talent agency executives, Genichi Taniguchi of Burning Productions, for allegedly stalking, intimidating, and harassing her.

== Diversity ==
Diversity of contestants and winners have both increased since the inception of beauty pageants. In 1945, Bess Myerson, an American politician, model and, television actress became the first Jewish person to win the Miss America title in the Atlantic city and to this day remains the only Jewish person to have received the crown. Her success in winning the title was hugely symbolic and personal to Jewish people at that time because it in the direct aftermath of the Holocaust. In 1959, Japanese model Akiko Kojima became the first woman of color to win the Miss Universe title. Her success marked the beginning of a shift away from white women as the global female beauty ideal. The continued success of Asian women in American and international beauty pageants has signaled that white women are no longer considered the beauty ideal. In 1983, Vanessa Williams, an American singer, actress and fashion designer gained recognition as being the first African American woman to receive the Miss America title. In 1991, Lupita Jones, a Mexican actress and television producer, became the first Mexican person to win Miss Universe.

Besides the international beauty pageants, numerous minor competitions exist throughout the world displaying the different perceptions of beauty. Some examples of criteria to select beauty queens that are unique to certain culture. The Miss India USA pageant uses Indian history and traditional craft skills as its specialties, while the Miss Howard University competition takes advantage of the principles of &quot;black beauty&quot;. The winner is often viewed as a model for the &quot;ideal&quot; community member. Through the competitions, the contestants can learn how to present themselves in public and how to cultivate certain traits such as confidence or poise. In some cases, the competitors are selected to act as a representative on behalf of the community. In the African American community of Howard University, the selected Miss Howard University served as advocates for the Civil Rights Movement in the decades following the 1960s. Additionally, the Miss Landmine competition situated in Angola allow victims to serve as advocates on behalf of other victims of mining accidents.

Researchers suggest that the emergence of beauty pageants in countries outside the United States is linked to an economic boom geared towards a more consumeristic lifestyle. For example, in India, from 1996 to 2000, the personal care industry grew by 25% while the number of women applying for the Miss India competition increased from 1000 people in 1993 to 6500 people in 2001. Additionally, after China hosted about 6 international beauty pageants in 2004, the beauty industry increased in influence in the area. At the same time, the number of regional beauty pageants in the country increased.

== Criticism ==
Critics of beauty pageants argue that such contests reinforce the idea that girls and women should be valued primarily for their physical appearance, and that this puts tremendous pressure on women to conform to conventional beauty standards by spending time and money on fashion, cosmetics, hair styling, and even cosmetic surgery. They say that this pursuit of physical beauty even encourages some women to diet to the point of harming themselves.

The London Feminist Network argues that rather than being empowering, beauty pageants do the opposite: denying women&#x27;s full humanity by subjecting them to objectification, denying their full humanity by maintaining that their primary purpose is to be attractive. Beginning in 1981, the International Year of the Disabled Person, campaigners in Australia targeted beauty pageants in order to, in the words of activist Leslie Hall, &quot;challenge the notion of beauty&quot; and &quot;reject the charity ethic.&quot; High profile demonstrations led to some charities abandoning their use of such contests for fundraising and also saw some remove offensive language from their organisational titles.

Another criticism is in the way beauty pageant is quantifiably scored as highlighted by the &quot;Myth of the Perfect 10&quot;. Beauty becomes a numerical coefficient in ranking contestants, and this type of scoring still remains followed as a system even in nationwide beauty pageants such as Miss America.

Researchers suggest that these events strengthen skills, such as interpersonal communications, self-assurance, and public speaking, which prove to be useful in future career paths.

=== Swimsuit competition ===

The requirement for contestants to wear a swimsuit was a controversial aspect of the various competitions. The controversy was heightened with the increasing popularity of the bikini after its introduction in 1946. The bikini was banned for the Miss America contest in 1947 because of Roman Catholic protesters. When the Miss World contest started in 1951, there was an outcry when the winner was crowned in a bikini. Pope Pius XII condemned the crowning as sinful, and countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. The bikini was banned for future and other contests. It was not until the late 1990s that they became permitted again, but still generated controversy when finals were held in countries where bikinis (or swimsuits in general) were socially disapproved. For example, in 2003, Vida Samadzai from Afghanistan caused an uproar in her native country when she participated in the Miss Earth 2003 contest in a red bikini. She was condemned by the Afghan Supreme Court, saying such a display of the body goes against Islamic law and Afghan culture. In 2013, the swimsuit round of the Miss World contest was dropped because of Islamist protests in Bali (Indonesia), where the contest took place. In 2014, the Miss World contest eliminated the swimsuit competition from its pageant. In 2018, Miss America eliminated the swimsuit competition after 97 years.

In 2017, Carousel Productions was criticized for objectifying women during the Miss Earth 2017 competition where delegates wore swimsuits during the event with their faces concealed by a veil in the &quot;Beauty of Figure and Form,&quot; a segment first introduced in the Miss Philippines Earth 2017 pageant. It was one of the three preliminary judging segments of the pageant that include &quot;Poise and Beauty of Face&quot; and &quot;Environmental and Intelligence Competition&quot;. The organizers defended the &quot;beauty of figure and form&quot; segment and released a statement that the said round was intended to promote strict impartiality during pre-judging by focusing on the contestants&#x27; curves, execution and not beautiful face.

== Scandals ==
There have been numerous scandals in the beauty pageant industry and they continue to emerge as beauty pageants become more known to the public. In December 2017, &quot;HuffPost&quot; published emails written by then-Miss America CEO Sam Haskell that disparaged former pageant contestants, making vulgar references to their weight and personal lives. Due to the release of these emails to the public, Haskell and several other board members resigned from their positions.

Laura Zúñiga, former Miss Hispanic America, was detained with her boyfriend and six other people, and charged with racketeering, drug trafficking, weapons violations, and money laundering. When apprehended, they had multiple handguns and roughly $53,000 in cash.

At the Miss Teen USA 2007 pageant, Caitlin Upton gained international notoriety for her convoluted and nonsensical response to a question posed to her during the August 2007 national pageant. During the pageant, judge Aimee Teegarden asked: &quot;Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can&#x27;t locate the U.S. on a world map. Why do you think this is?&quot;. Upton responded:

I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because, uh, some, uh, people out there in our nation don&#x27;t have maps and, uh, I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and, uh, the Iraq, everywhere like such as, and, I believe that they should, our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S., uh, or, uh, should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able to build up our future. For our children.
As a guest on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot;, Upton told Ann Curry and Matt Lauer that she was overwhelmed when asked the question and did not comprehend it correctly.

<text>Australian Catholic University (ACU) is a public university in Australia. It has seven Australian campuses and also maintains a campus in Rome.

== History ==

Australian Catholic University was opened on 1 January 1991 following the amalgamation of four Catholic tertiary institutions in eastern Australia:
* Catholic College of Education Sydney, New South Wales
* Institute of Catholic Education, Victoria
* McAuley College, Queensland
* Signadou College of Education, Australian Capital Territory

These institutions had their origins in the mid-1800s, when religious orders and institutes became involved in preparing teachers for Catholic schools and, later, nurses for Catholic hospitals. Through a series of amalgamations, relocations, transfers of responsibilities and diocesan initiatives, more than 20 historical entities have contributed to the creation of the university.

== Governance and structure ==

ACU&#x27;s vice-chancellor and president, Zlatko Skrbis, is responsible for representing the university both nationally and internationally and for providing strategic leadership and management. He holds a PhD in Sociology.

Deputy vice-chancellors have delegated responsibility for assigned areas of policy. These areas are academic, administration and resources, and research.

=== Faculties and departments ===
Each faculty is headed by an executive dean and supported by a number of associate deans and heads of schools.

== Campuses and buildings ==
ACU has seven campuses across Australia: Ballarat, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney (Blacktown, North Sydney, Strathfield) with a Leadership Centre in Adelaide and another in Townsville. In 2015, the university opened the Rome Centre, a collaboration with the Catholic University of America, located in Rome, Italy.

The Mount St Mary Campus in Strathfield is heritage listed.


== Academic profile ==
=== Research and publications ===
HDR students have objected to a change plan introduced in September 2023 that would eliminate positions occupied by their supervisors leaving them without supervisors with the relevant expertise for their projects.

== Student life ==

=== Student union ===
Each ACU campus has a student representative council and there is a national student body called the Australian Catholic University National Students&#x27; Association (ACUNSA), which advocates on behalf of students both individually and collectively.

=== Sports and athletics ===
The university hosts an annual national sporting event – the ACU Games – and students also compete in Australia&#x27;s largest annual multisport event, the Australian University Games.

== Controversies ==

=== Position on LGBT visibility ===
In March 2023, controversy broke out on campus when librarians were ordered to remove the rainbow flags that had been displayed across campuses. Staff and students wrote an open letter to the university&#x27;s Vice-Chancellor Zlatko Skrbis claiming that his acts were &quot;a direct affront to ACU&#x27;s mission to act in truth and love in the pursuit of knowledge, the dignity of the human person, and the common good&quot;. The university&#x27;s position against LGBT visibility appeared consistent with its earlier refusal to allow the Gay and Lesbian Teachers and Students Association to establish an LGBT+ support group on its Strathclyde campus, but to depart from Pope Francis&#x27; increasingly affirming stance on LGBT topics.

=== AGS investigation ===
In July 2023, ACU launched an internal investigation into its contracts with Asset Group Solutions. AGS had provided security and cleaning services to ACU but its founder had been charged with corruption. Stephen Weller (Chief Operating Officer and Deputy-Vice Chancellor) had been warned in 2018 about AGS&#x27;s conduct but did not act on those warnings. ACU responded by denying knowledge of AGS’s criminal activities and has launched an internal investigation.

=== Job cuts ===
In September 2023, ACU announced plans to cut 113 full-time jobs, most of which were at the Melbourne campus. This was part of spending cuts intended to reduce a forecast $30 million deficit and respond to shrinking enrollments. The cuts were announced as a $250 million campus building, which was constructed to accommodate student and staff growth, neared completion. This has produced an international response in which many academics denounced the university. Timothy Williamson, a professor of philosophy at Oxford and Yale, told reporters that ACU&#x27;s meteoric rise to the pinnacle of research in philosophy was &quot;unprecedented&quot; but that cuts would give ACU the reputation &quot;as a Mickey Mouse university ... damaging the good international standing of the Australian university system as a whole&quot;.

<text>In Wotjobaluk mythology, Gnowee is a female personification of the Sun. She was once a woman who lived upon the Earth at a time when it was eternally dark, and people could only move about with the aid of bark torches. One day, she left her little son sleeping while she went out to dig for yams. Food was scarce, and Gnowee wandered so far that she reached the end of the Earth, passed under it and emerged on the other side. Not knowing where she was, she could not find her little son anywhere, so she climbed into the sky with her great bark torch to get a clearer view. She still wanders the sky to this day, lighting the whole world with her torch as she continues to search for her lost son.

<doc id="95210" wikidata="Q7769222" url="?curid=95210" title="The Tides of Manaunaun">
<text>The Tides of Manaunaun is a short piano piece in D Major by American composer Henry Cowell (1897–1965). It premiered publicly in 1917, serving as a prelude to a theatrical production, &quot;The Building of Banba&quot;. &quot;The Tides of Manaunaun&quot; is the best known of Cowell&#x27;s many tone cluster pieces.

==Background==
&quot;The Building of Banba&quot;, for which &quot;The Tides of Manaunaun&quot; was composed, was based on Irish mythological poems by the theosophist John Osborne Varian. &quot;The Building of Banba&quot; has been described by some scholars as a &quot;pageant&quot; or &quot;play&quot;, and by Cowell himself (more than fifty years later) as an &quot;opera&quot;. The production was staged in the summer of 1917 at a convention of the theosophical community of Halcyon in coastal San Luis Obispo County, California; Varian was a leader of the group, to which he had introduced the 20-year-old Cowell. Cowell would later claim that &quot;The Tides of Manaunaun&quot; had been composed in 1912, or even earlier. In 1944 Cowell arranged this song for orchestra and band – presumably to be played on radio – but the score was lost and no records have been found to confirm the radio broadcast. This song is dedicated to &quot;B.W.W.&quot;, Blanche Wetherill Walton (1871–1963), Cowell&#x27;s foremost patron and adherent over the years as well as a patron to Charles Seeger and Ruth Crawford Seeger. Cowell dedicated five other works to her between 1924 and 1961: &quot;Ensemble, How Come?&quot;, &quot;Euphoria&quot;, &quot;Merry Christmas for Blanche&quot;, and &quot;Birthday Melody for Blanche&quot;.

The work is the most famous and widely played of Cowell&#x27;s tone cluster pieces, which he performed during tours of North America and Europe from the early 1920s through the mid-1930s. A performance of Cowell&#x27;s so inspired Béla Bartók that the great Hungarian composer sought Cowell&#x27;s permission to use tone clusters in his own work. Bartók would feature them in his Piano Sonata (1926) and suite &quot;Out of Doors&quot; (1926), his first significant works after three years of little composition.

Other early pieces of Cowell&#x27;s featuring tone clusters include the atonal, dissonant &quot;Dynamic Motion&quot; (1916) and its five &quot;encores&quot;—&quot;What&#x27;s This?&quot; (1917), &quot;Amiable Conversation&quot; (1917), &quot;Advertisement&quot; (1917), &quot;Antinomy&quot; (1917, rev. 1959; frequently misspelled &quot;Antimony&quot;), and &quot;Time Table&quot; (1917). In &quot;The Tides of Manaunaun&quot; the clusters resound majestically and then slowly subside, conveying not dissonance but transcendent mystery. As Cowell describes on the final, narrative track of the Folkways album on which his last piano recordings appear,

In Irish mythology, Manaunaun was the god of motion and of the waves of the sea. And according to the mythology, at the time when the universe was being built, Manaunaun swayed all of the materials out of which the universe was being built with fine particles which were distributed everywhere through cosmos. And he kept these moving in rhythmical tides so that they should remain fresh when the time came for their use in the building of the universe. 

During the first two decades of his compositional career, Cowell continued often to reference Irish mythology in the titles of his piano pieces. &quot;The Harp of Life&quot; (1924), Cowell said, &quot;is another in the suite based on the early Irish mythological opera,&quot; as, he explained, were &quot;The Voice of Lir&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Trumpet of Angus Óg&quot; (1918–24). Additional mythic traditions are referenced by &quot;The Hero Sun&quot; (1922), &quot;The Banshee&quot; (1925), and &quot;The Leprechaun&quot; (1928). Cowell also wrote songs of a similarly mythological character, including &quot;Angus Óg (The Spirit of Youth)&quot; (1917) and &quot;Manaunaun&#x27;s Birthday&quot; (1924).

==Recordings==
&quot;The Tides of Manaunaun&quot; was first recorded around 1925 by Margaret Nikoloric for piano roll. Edwin Hughes played it for President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House, and Percy Grainger performed it frequently. (In 1940, Grainger would come to Cowell&#x27;s aid by hiring him as an assistant when Cowell was paroled after serving four years in prison on a &quot;morals&quot; charge.) Under the name &quot;Deep Tides&quot;, Leopold Stokowski orchestrated &quot;The Tides of Manaunaun&quot; as the first of four &quot;Tales of Our Countryside&quot; (also known as &quot;Four Irish Tales&quot;), which he recorded in 1941. Cowell himself would record the original version at least twice—for Pleyel piano roll in the 1920s and for Folkways in the 1960s. It has been most recently recorded by Steffen Schleiermacher (1993, rel. 1994), Sorrel Hays (1997, rel. 1999), and Stefan Litwin (1999).

<text>The dissolution of the monasteries, occasionally referred to as the suppression of the monasteries, was the set of administrative and legal processes between 1536 and 1541, by which Henry VIII disbanded Catholic monasteries, priories, convents, and friaries in England, Wales, and Ireland; seized their wealth; disposed of their assets, and provided for their former personnel and functions.

Though the policy was originally envisioned as a way to increase the regular income of the Crown, much former monastic property was sold off to fund Henry&#x27;s military campaigns in the 1540s. Henry did this under the Act of Supremacy, passed by Parliament in 1534, which made him &quot;Supreme Head&quot; of the Church in England. He had broken from Rome&#x27;s papal authority the previous year. The monasteries were dissolved by two Acts of Parliament, those being the First Suppression Act in 1535 and the Second Suppression Act in 1539. 

While Thomas Cromwell, vicar-general and vicegerent of England, is often considered the leader of the dissolution, he merely oversaw the project—he had hoped for reform, not eliminating the practice. The dissolution project was created by England&#x27;s Lord Chancellor, Thomas Audley, and Court of Augmentations head, Richard Rich.

Historian George W. Bernard argues that:
 In the end, Henry gave most of the money to supply the war.

==Context==

At the time of their suppression, only some English and Welsh religious houses could trace their origins to Anglo-Saxon or Celtic foundations before the Norman Conquest. The overwhelming majority of the 625 monastic communities dissolved by Henry VIII had developed in the wave of monastic enthusiasm that swept western Christendom in the 11th and 12th centuries. Few had been founded later than the end of the 13th century; the youngest was the Bridgettine nunnery of Syon Abbey, founded in 1415.

Typically, 11th and 12th-century founders endowed monastic houses with revenue from landed estates and tithes appropriated from parish churches under the founder&#x27;s patronage. As a consequence, religious houses in the 16th century controlled appointment to about two-fifths of all parish benefices in England, disposed of about half of all ecclesiastical income, and owned around a quarter of the nation&#x27;s landed wealth. An English medieval proverb said that if the abbot of Glastonbury married the abbess of Shaftesbury, their heir would have more land than the king of England.

200 more houses of friars in England and Wales constituted a second distinct wave of monastic zeal in the 13th century. Friaries, for the most part, were concentrated in urban areas. Unlike monasteries, friaries had no income-bearing endowments; the friars, as mendicants, were supported financially by donations from the faithful, while ideally being self-sufficient and raising extensive urban kitchen gardens.

The dissolution of the monasteries took place in the political context of other attacks on the ecclesiastical institutions of Western Catholicism. Many of these were related to the Reformation in Continental Europe. By the end of the 16th century, monasticism had almost entirely disappeared from those European states whose rulers had adopted Lutheran or Reformed confessions of faith (Ireland being the only major exception). They continued in states that remained Catholic, and new community orders such as the Jesuits and Capuchins emerged alongside the older orders.

The religious and political changes in England under Henry VIII and Edward VI were of a different nature from those taking place in Germany, Bohemia, France, Scotland and Geneva. Across much of continental Europe, the seizure of monastic property was associated with mass discontent among the common people and the lower levels of clergy and civil society against powerful and wealthy ecclesiastical institutions. Such popular hostility against the church was rare in England before 1558; the Reformation in England and Ireland was directed from the king and high society. These changes were initially met with popular suspicion; on some occasions and in particular localities, there was active resistance to the royal programme.

===Complaints===
Dissatisfaction with regular religious life, and with the gross extent of monastic wealth, was near universal amongst late medieval secular and ecclesiastical rulers in the Latin West. Bernard says there was:


Erasmus had made a threefold criticism of the monks and nuns of his day, saying that:
# in withdrawing from the world into their own communal life, they elevated man-made monastic vows of poverty, chastity and obedience above the God-given vows of sacramental baptism; and elevated man-made monastic rules for religious life above the God-given teachings of the Gospels;
# notwithstanding exceptional communities of genuine austere life and exemplary charity, the overwhelming majority of abbeys and priories were havens for idle drones, concerned only for their own existence, reserving for themselves an excessive share of the commonwealth&#x27;s religious assets, and contributing little or nothing to the spiritual needs of ordinary people;
# the monasteries, almost without exception, were deeply involved in promoting and profiting from the veneration of relics, in the form of pilgrimages and purported miraculous tokens. The cult of relics was by no means specific to monasteries, but Erasmus was scandalised by the extent to which well-educated and highly regarded monks and nuns would participate in fraud (as he thought it) against gullible lay believers.

Summarising the state of monastic life across Western Europe, David Knowles said,

===Reforms===
Pilgrimages to monastic shrines continued until forcibly suppressed in England in 1538 by order of Henry VIII, but the dissolution resulted in few modifications to England&#x27;s parish churches. The English religious reforms of the 1530s corresponded little with the movement by Protestant Reformers, and encountered much popular hostility when they did. In 1536, Convocation adopted and Parliament enacted the Ten Articles, containing some terminology and ideas drawn from Luther and Melanchthon; but any momentum towards Protestantism stalled when Henry VIII expressed his support for the Six Articles of 1539, which remained in effect until after his death.

Cardinal Wolsey had obtained a papal bull authorising some limited reforms in the English Church as early as 1518, but reformers (both conservative and radical) had become increasingly frustrated at their lack of progress. In November 1529, Parliament passed Acts reforming apparent abuses in the English Church. They set a cap on fees, both for the probate of wills and mortuary expenses for burial in hallowed ground; tightened regulations covering rights of sanctuary for criminals; and reduced to two the number of church benefices that could in the future be held by one man. These Acts were meant to demonstrate that royal jurisdiction over the Church would ensure progress in &quot;religious reformation&quot; where papal authority had been insufficient.

The monasteries were next in line. J. J. Scarisbrick remarked in his biography of Henry VIII:

The stories of monastic impropriety, vice, and excess that were to be collected by Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s visitors to the monasteries, including Richard Layton and Thomas Legh, may have been exaggerated but the religious houses of England and Wales—with the notable exceptions of those of the Carthusians, the Observant Franciscans, and the Bridgettine nuns and monks—had long ceased to play a leading role in the spiritual life of the country. Other than in these three orders, observance of strict monastic rules was partial at best. The exceptional spiritual discipline of the Carthusian, Observant Franciscan and Bridgettine orders had, over the previous century, resulted in their being singled out for royal favour, in particular with houses benefitting from endowments confiscated by the Crown from the suppressed alien priories.

Donations and legacies had tended to go instead towards parish churches, university colleges, grammar schools and collegiate churches, which suggests greater public approbation. Levels of monastic debt were increasing, and average numbers of professed religious were falling, although the monasteries continued to attract recruits right up to the end. Only a few monks and nuns lived in conspicuous luxury, but most were comfortably fed and housed by the standards of the time, and few orders demanded ascetic piety or religious observance. Only a minority of houses could now support the twelve or thirteen professed religious usually regarded as the minimum necessary to maintain the full canonical hours of the Divine Office. Even in houses with adequate numbers, the regular obligations of communal eating and shared living had not been fully enforced for centuries, as communities tended to sub-divide into a number of distinct &quot;familiae&quot;. In most larger houses, the full observance of the Canonical Hours had become the task of a sub-group of &#x27;Cloister Monks&#x27;, such that the majority of inhabitants were freed to conduct their business and live much of their lives in the secular world. Extensive monastic complexes dominated English towns of any size, but most were less than half full.

From 1534 onwards, Cromwell and King Henry wanted to redirect ecclesiastical income to the Crown—they justified this by contending that they were reclaiming what was theirs. Renaissance princes throughout Europe were facing severe financial difficulties due to sharply rising expenditures, especially to pay for armies, ships and fortifications. Many had already resorted to plundering monastic wealth. Protestant princes would justify this by claiming divine authority; Catholic princes would obtain the agreement of the papacy. Monastic wealth, regarded everywhere as excessive, offered a standing temptation for cash-strapped authorities.

Almost all official action in the English dissolution was directed at the monasteries. The closing of the monasteries aroused popular opposition, but resistors became the targets of royal hostility. The surrender of the friaries, from an official perspective, arose almost as an afterthought, once it had been determined that all religious houses would have to go. In terms of popular esteem, the balance tilted the other way. Almost all monasteries supported themselves from their endowments; in late medieval terms &#x27;they lived off their own&#x27;. Unless they were notably bad landlords, they tended to enjoy widespread local support; they also commonly appointed local notables to fee-bearing offices. The friars were by contrast much more likely to have been the objects of local hostility, especially since their practice of soliciting income through legacies appears to have been perceived as diminishing family inheritances.

==Precedents for confiscations==
By the time Henry VIII turned to monastery reform, royal action to suppress religious houses had a history of more than 200 years; his innovation was in scale. The first case was that of the so-called &#x27;alien priories&#x27;. As a result of the Norman Conquest of 1066, some French religious orders held substantial property through their daughter monasteries in England.

Some of these were granges, agricultural estates with a single foreign monk in residence to supervise; others were rich foundations in their own right (e.g., Lewes Priory was a daughter of Cluny and answered to the abbot of the French house).

Owing to frequent wars between England and France in the late Middle Ages, successive English governments objected to money going overseas to France. They also objected to foreign prelates having jurisdiction over English monasteries.
After 1378, French monasteries (and alien priories dependent on them) maintained allegiance to the Avignon Papacy. Their suppression was supported by the rival Roman Popes, conditional on all confiscated monastic property being redirected into other religious uses. The king&#x27;s officers first sequestrated the assets of the alien priories in 1295–1303 under Edward I, and the pattern repeated for long periods over the course of the 14th century, most particularly in the reign of Edward III.

Alien priories with functioning communities were forced to pay large sums to the king, while mere estates were confiscated and run by royal officers, the proceeds going to the king&#x27;s pocket. Such estates were a valuable source of income for the Crown in its French wars. Most of the larger alien priories became naturalised (for instance Castle Acre Priory), on payment of heavy fines and bribes, but for around 90 smaller houses, their fates were sealed when Henry V dissolved them by act of Parliament in 1414.

The properties were taken over by the Crown; some were kept, some were given or sold to Henry&#x27;s supporters, others were assigned to his new monasteries of Syon Abbey and the Carthusians at Sheen Priory; others were used for educational purposes. All these suppressions enjoyed papal approval but successive 15th-century popes continued to press for assurances that the confiscated monastic income would revert to religious uses.

The medieval understanding of religious houses as institutions associated monasteries and nunneries with their property: their endowments of land and income, and not their current personnel of monks and nuns. If the property with which a house had been endowed by its founder were to be confiscated or surrendered, then the house ceased to exist, whether its members continued in the religious life or not. The founder and their heirs had a legally enforceable interest in certain aspects of the house; their nomination was required at the election of an abbot or prior, they could claim hospitality within the house when needed, and they could be buried within the house when they died. In addition, though this scarcely ever happened, the endowments of the house would revert to the founder&#x27;s heirs if the community failed or dissolved. The status of &#x27;founder&#x27; was considered in civil law to be real property, and could consequently be bought and sold, in which case the purchaser would be called the patron. Like any other real property, in intestacy and some other circumstances the status of &#x27;founder&#x27; would revert to the Crown—a procedure that many houses actively sought, as it might be advantageous in their legal dealings in the King&#x27;s courts.

The founders of the alien priories had been foreign monasteries refusing allegiance to the English Crown. These property rights were therefore automatically forfeited to the Crown when their English dependencies were dissolved, but their example prompted questions as to what action might be taken should English houses cease to exist. Much would depend on who, at the time the house ended, held the status of founder or patron; as with other such disputes in real property, the standard procedure was to empanel a jury to decide between disputing claimants. In practice, the Crown claimed the status of &#x27;founder&#x27; in all such cases that occurred. Consequently, when a monastic community failed (e.g., through the death of most of its members, or through insolvency), the bishop would seek to obtain papal approval for alternative use of the house&#x27;s endowments in canon law. This, with royal agreement claiming &#x27;foundership&#x27;, would be presented to an &#x27;empanelled jury&#x27; for consent to use of the property of the house in civil law.

The royal transfer of alien monastic estates to educational foundations inspired bishops and, as the 15th century waned, this practice was common. The subjects of these dissolutions were usually small, poor, and indebted Benedictine or Augustinian communities (especially those of women) with few powerful friends; the great abbeys and orders exempt from diocesan supervision such as the Cistercians were unaffected.
The resources were transferred often to Oxford University and Cambridge University colleges: instances of this include John Alcock, Bishop of Ely dissolving the Benedictine St Radegund&#x27;s Priory, Cambridge to found Jesus College, Cambridge (1496), and William Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester acquiring Selborne Priory in Hampshire in 1484 for Magdalen College, Oxford.

In the following century, Lady Margaret Beaufort obtained the property of Creake Abbey (whose religious had all died of sweating sickness in 1506) to fund her works at Oxford and Cambridge. She was advised in this action by the staunch traditionalist John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester.

In 1522, Fisher himself dissolved the women&#x27;s monasteries of Bromhall and Higham to aid St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. That same year, Cardinal Wolsey dissolved St Frideswide&#x27;s Priory (now Oxford Cathedral) to form the basis of his Christ Church, Oxford; in 1524, he secured a papal bull to dissolve 20 other monasteries to provide an endowment for his new college. The remaining friars, monks and nuns were absorbed into other houses of their respective orders. Juries found the property of the houses to have reverted to the Crown as founder.

The conventional wisdom of the time was that the proper daily observance of the Divine Office of prayer required a minimum of twelve professed religious, but by the 1530s, few communities in England could provide this. Most observers were in agreement that a systematic reform of the English church must involve the drastic concentration of monks and nuns into fewer, larger houses, potentially making monastic income available for more productive religious, educational and social purposes.
This apparent consensus often faced strong resistance in practice. Members of religious houses proposed for dissolution might resist relocation; the houses invited to receive them might refuse to co-operate; and local notables might resist the disruption in their networks of influence. Reforming bishops found they faced opposition when urging the heads of religious houses to enforce their monastic rules, especially those requiring monks and nuns to remain within their cloisters. Monks and nuns in almost all late medieval English religious communities, although theoretically living in religious poverty, were paid an annual cash wage () and received other regular cash rewards and pittances, which softened claustral rules for those who disliked them. Religious superiors met their bishops&#x27; pressure with the response that the cloistered ideal was only acceptable to a tiny minority of regular clergy, and that any attempt to enforce their order&#x27;s stricter rules could be overturned in counter-actions in the secular courts, if aggrieved monks and nuns obtained a writ of praemunire.

The King actively supported Wolsey, Fisher and Richard Foxe in their programmes of monastic reform; but even so, progress was painfully slow, especially where religious orders had been exempted from episcopal oversight by papal authority. It was also never certain that juries would find in favour of the Crown in disposing of the property of dissolved houses; any action that impinged on monasteries with substantial assets might be expected to be contested by a range of influential claimants. In 1532, the priory of Christchurch Aldgate, facing financial and legal difficulties, petitioned the King as founder for assistance, only to find themselves dissolved arbitrarily. Rather than risk empanelling a jury, and with papal participation no longer being welcome, the Lord Chancellor, Thomas Audley, recommended that dissolution should be legalised retrospectively through a special act of Parliament.
==Continental precedents==
In 1521, Martin Luther had published (&quot;On the monastic vows&quot;), a treatise which declared that the monastic life had no scriptural basis, was pointless and also actively immoral, incompatible with the true spirit of Christianity. Luther also declared that monastic vows were meaningless and that no one should feel bound by them. Luther, a one-time Augustinian friar, found some comfort when these views had a dramatic effect: a special meeting of the German province of his order held the same year voted that henceforth every member of the regular clergy should be free to renounce their vows, resign their offices, and marry. At Luther&#x27;s home monastery in Wittenberg all the friars, save one, did so.

News spread among Protestant-minded rulers across Europe, and some, particularly in Scandinavia, moved very quickly. In the of Västerås in 1527, initiating the Reformation in Sweden, King Gustav Vasa secured an edict of the Diet allowing him to confiscate any monastic lands he deemed necessary to increase royal revenues, and to allow the return of donated properties to the descendants of the donors. By the following Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden, Gustav gained large estates, as well as loyal supporters among the nobility who reclaimed donations given by their families to the convents. The Swedish monasteries and convents were simultaneously deprived of their livelihoods. They were banned from accepting new novices, and forbidden to prevent their existing members from leaving. However, the former monks and nuns were allowed to reside in the convent buildings for life on state allowance, and many communities survived the Reformation for decades. The last of them was Vreta Abbey, where the last nuns died in 1582, and Vadstena Abbey, from which the last nuns emigrated in 1595, about half a century after the Reduction.

In Denmark–Norway, King Frederick I made a similar act in 1528, confiscating 15 of the houses of the wealthiest monasteries and convents. Further laws by his successor in the 1530s banned the friars and forced monks and nuns to transfer title to their houses to the Crown, which passed them out to supportive nobles who soon acquired former monastic lands.

In Switzerland, too, monasteries were under threat. In 1523, the government of the city-state of Zürich pressured nuns to leave their monasteries and marry and followed up the next year by dissolving all monasteries in its territory, under the pretext of using their revenues to fund education and help the poor. The city of Basel followed suit in 1529, and Geneva adopted the same policy in 1530. An attempt was also made in 1530 to dissolve the famous Abbey of St. Gall, which was a state of the Holy Roman Empire in its own right, but this failed, and St. Gall survived until 1798.

In France and Scotland, by contrast, royal action to seize monastic income proceeded along entirely different lines. In both countries, the practice of nominating abbacies had become widespread. Since the 12th century, it had become universal in Western Europe for the household expenses of abbots and conventual priors to be separated, typically appropriating more than half the house&#x27;s income. With papal approval, these funds might be diverted on a vacancy to support a non-monastic ecclesiastic, commonly a bishop or member of the Papal Curia; and although such arrangements were nominally temporary, commendatory abbacies often continued long-term. Then, by the Concordat of Bologna in 1516, Pope Leo X granted to Francis I authority to nominate almost all abbots and conventual priors in France. Around 80 per cent of French abbacies came to be held , the commendators often being lay courtiers or royal servants; around half the income of French monasteries was diverted into the hands of the Crown, or of royal supporters, all with the Popes&#x27; blessing. Where the French kings led, the Scots kings followed. In Scotland, where the proportion of parish tiends appropriated by higher ecclesiastical institutions exceeded 85 per cent, in 1532 the young James V obtained from the Pope approval to appoint his illegitimate infant sons (of which he eventually acquired nine) as commendators to abbacies in Scotland. Other Scots aristocratic families stuck similar deals, and consequently over £40,000 (Scots) per annum was diverted from monasteries into the royal coffers.

It is inconceivable that these moves went unnoticed by the English government and particularly by Thomas Cromwell, who had been employed by Wolsey in his monastic suppressions, and who would become Henry VIII&#x27;s King&#x27;s Secretary. Henry appears to have been much more influenced by the opinions on monasticism of the humanists Desiderius Erasmus and Thomas More, especially as found in Erasmus&#x27;s work &quot;In Praise of Folly&quot; (1511) and More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; (1516). Erasmus and More promoted ecclesiastical reform while remaining faithful to the Church of Rome and had ridiculed such monastic practices as repetitive formal religion, superstitious pilgrimages for the veneration of relics, and the accumulation of monastic wealth. Henry appears to have shared these views, never having endowed a religious house and only once having undertaken a religious pilgrimage, to Walsingham in 1511. From 1518, Thomas More was increasingly influential as a royal servant and counsellor, in the course of which his correspondence included strong condemnations of the idleness and vice in monastic life, alongside his equally vituperative attacks on Luther. Henry himself corresponded continually with Erasmus, prompting him to be more explicit in his public rejection of the key tenets of Lutheranism and offering him church preferment should he wish to return to England.

==Process==

===Declaration as Head of the Church===

On famously failing to receive from the Pope a declaration of nullity regarding his marriage, Henry had himself declared Supreme Head of the Church of England in February 1531, and instigated a programme of legislation to establish this Royal Supremacy in law. In April 1533, an Act in Restraint of Appeals eliminated the right of clergy to appeal to &quot;foreign tribunals&quot; (Rome) over the King&#x27;s head in any matter. All ecclesiastical charges and levies that had previously been payable to Rome would now go to the King. By the Submission of the Clergy, the English clergy and religious orders subscribed to the proposition that the King was, and had always been, the Supreme Head of the Church in England. Consequently, in Henry&#x27;s view, any act of monastic resistance to royal authority would be more than just treasonable; it would also be a breach of the monastic vow of obedience. Under heavy threats, almost all religious houses joined the rest of the Church in acceding to the Royal Supremacy; and in swearing to uphold the validity of the King&#x27;s divorce and remarriage. Opposition was concentrated in the houses of Carthusian monks, Observant Franciscan friars and Bridgettine monks and nuns. Great efforts were made to cajole, bribe, trick and threaten these houses into formal compliance, with those religious who continued in their resistance being liable to imprisonment until they submitted or if they persisted, to execution for treason. All the houses of the Observant Friars were handed over to the mainstream Franciscan order; the friars from the Greenwich house were imprisoned, where many died from ill-treatment. The Carthusians eventually submitted, other than the monks of the London house which was suppressed; some of the monks were executed for high treason in 1535, and others starved to death in prison. Also opposing the Supremacy and consequently imprisoned were Bridgettine monks from Syon Abbey. The Syon nuns, being strictly enclosed, escaped sanction at this stage, the personal compliance of the abbess being taken as sufficient for the government&#x27;s purposes. 

G. W. O. Woodward concluded that: 

===Visitation of the monasteries===

In 1534, Cromwell undertook, on behalf of the King, an inventory of the endowments, liabilities and income of the entire ecclesiastical estate of England and Wales, including the monasteries (see ), for the purpose of assessing the Church&#x27;s taxable value, through local commissioners who reported in May 1535. At the same time, Henry had Parliament authorise Cromwell to &quot;visit&quot; all the monasteries, including those like the Cistercians previously exempted from episcopal oversight by papal dispensation, to instruct them in their duty to obey the King and reject papal authority. Cromwell delegated his visitation authority to hand-picked commissioners, chiefly Richard Layton, Thomas Legh, John ap Rice and John Tregonwell, for the purposes of ascertaining the quality of religious life being maintained in religious houses, of assessing the prevalence of &#x27;superstitious&#x27; religious observances such as the veneration of relics, and for inquiring into evidence of moral laxity (especially sexual). The chosen commissioners were mostly secular clergy, and appear to have been Erasmian, doubtful of the value of monastic life and universally dismissive of relics and miraculous tokens. By comparison with the valuation commissions, the timetable for these monastic visitations was tight, with some houses missed altogether, and inquiries appear to have concentrated on gross faults and laxity; consequently, where the reports of misbehaviour can be checked against other sources, they commonly appear to have been both rushed and greatly exaggerated, often recalling events from years before. The visitors interviewed each member of the house and selected servants, prompting individual confessions of wrongdoing and asking them to inform on one another. From their correspondence with Cromwell it can be seen that the visitors knew that findings of impropriety were both expected and desired; however, where no faults were revealed, none were reported. The visitors put the worst construction they could on whatever they were told, but they do not appear to have fabricated allegations of wrongdoing outright.

===Reports and further visitations===

In the autumn of 1535, the visiting commissioners were sending back to Cromwell their written reports, enclosing with them bundles of purported miraculous wimples, girdles and mantles that monks and nuns had been lending out for cash to the sick, or to mothers in labour. The commissioners appear to have instructed houses to reintroduce the strict practice of common dining and cloistered living, urging that those unable to comply should be encouraged to leave; and many appear to have been released from their monastic vows. The visitors reported the number of professed religious persons continuing in each house. In the case of seven houses, impropriety or irreligion had been so great, or the numbers remaining so few, that the commissioners had felt compelled to suppress it on the spot; in others, the abbot, prior or noble patron was reported to be petitioning the King for a house to be dissolved. Such authority had formerly rested with the Pope, but now the King would need to establish a legal basis for dissolution in statutory law. Moreover, it was by no means clear that the property of a surrendered house would automatically be at the disposal of the Crown; a good case could be made for this property to revert to the heirs and descendants of the founder or other patron. Parliament enacted the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 (&quot;Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act&quot;) in early 1535, relying on the reports of &quot;impropriety&quot; Cromwell had received, establishing the power of the King to dissolve religious houses that were failing to maintain a religious life, consequently providing for the King to compulsorily dissolve monasteries with annual incomes declared in the of less than £200 (of which there were potentially 419) but also giving the King the discretion to exempt any of these houses from dissolution at his pleasure. All property of the dissolved house would revert to the Crown. Many monasteries falling below the threshold forwarded a case for continuation, offering to pay substantial fines. Many such cases were accepted, so that only around 330 were referred to suppression commissions, and only 243 houses were actually dissolved at this time. The choice of a £200 threshold as the criterion for general dissolution under the legislation was suspect, as the preamble refers to numbers rather than income. Adopting a financial criterion was likely determined pragmatically; the Valor Ecclesiasticus data being both more reliable and more complete than those of Cromwell&#x27;s visitors.
The smaller houses identified for suppression were visited during 1536 by more local commissions, one for each county, charged with creating an inventory of assets and valuables, and empowered to obtain co-operation from monastic superiors by granting pensions or bribes. In practice, few houses immediately surrendered. A two-stage procedure was applied, the commissions reporting back to Cromwell for a decision as to whether to proceed with dissolution. These commissioners often supported the continuation of a house where they found no serious problem; arguments that Cromwell appears to have accepted. Around 80 houses were exempted. Where dissolution was determined, a second visit would affect the arrangements for closure of the house, disposal of its assets and endowments and provisions for the future of its members. Otherwise, the second visit would collect a fine. In general, these commissioners were less inclined to report faults in monastic observance within the smaller houses than the earlier group had been, although this may have been coloured by an awareness that monks and nuns with a bad reputation would be difficult to place elsewhere. The 1536 Act established that, whatever the claims of founders or patrons, the property of the dissolved smaller houses reverted to the Crown. Cromwell established a new government agency, the Court of Augmentations, to manage that. Although the property rights of lay founders and patrons were legally extinguished, the incomes of lay holders of monastic offices, pensions and annuities were generally preserved, as were the rights of tenants of monastic lands. Ordinary monks and nuns were given the choice of secularisation (with a cash gratuity but no pension), or of transfer to a continuing larger house of the same order. The majority of those then remaining chose to continue in the religious life. In some areas, the premises of a suppressed religious house were recycled into a new foundation to accommodate them, and rehousing those seeking a transfer proved much more difficult and time-consuming than appears to have been anticipated. Two houses, Norton Priory in Cheshire and Hexham Abbey in Northumberland, attempted to resist the commissioners by force, actions which Henry interpreted as treason. He wrote personally to demand the brutal punishment of those responsible. The prior and canons of Norton were imprisoned for several months and were fortunate to escape with their lives; the canons of Hexham, who made the mistake of becoming involved in the Pilgrimage of Grace, were executed.

===Initial round of suppressions===
 The first round of suppressions initially aroused popular discontent, especially in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire where many contributed to the Pilgrimage of Grace of 1536. This turn led to Henry increasingly associating monasticism with betrayal, as some of the spared religious houses in northern England (more or less willingly) sided with the rebels, while former monks resumed religious life in several of the suppressed houses. Clauses within the Treasons Act 1534 provided that the property of those convicted of treason would automatically revert to the Crown, clauses that Cromwell had drafted with the intention of effecting the dissolution of religious houses, arguing that the superior of the house (abbot, abbess, prior or prioress) was the legal &quot;owner&quot; of all its monastic property. The wording of the First Suppression Act had been clear that reform, not outright abolition of monastic life, was being presented as the objective of the government. There has been continuing academic debate as to whether a universal dissolution was being covertly prepared at this point.

The predominant academic opinion is that the extensive care taken to provide for monks and nuns from the suppressed houses to transfer demonstrates that monastic reform was still, at least in the mind of the King, the guiding principle. Further large-scale action against substandard richer monasteries was always planned. The selection of poorer houses for dissolution in the First Act minimised the potential release of funds to other purposes. Once pensions had been committed to former superiors, cash rewards paid to those wishing to leave the religious life, and funding allocated for refounded houses, it is unlikely that the crown profited beyond the fines levied on exempted houses. During 1537 (possibly conditioned by concern not to re-ignite rebellious impulses) no further dissolutions were undertaken. Episcopal visitations were renewed, monasteries adapted their internal discipline in accordance with Cromwell&#x27;s injunctions, and many houses undertook overdue programmes of repair and reconstruction.

The remaining monasteries required funds, partly to pay fines for exemption. During 1537 and 1538, there was a large increase in monastic lands and endowments being leased out, and in the offer of fee-paying offices and annuities in return for cash. By establishing long-term liabilities, these actions diminished the eventual net return to the Crown from each house&#x27;s endowments, but they were not officially discouraged. Cromwell obtained and solicited many such fees in his own personal favour. Crucially, having created the precedent that tenants and lay recipients of monastic incomes might expect to have their interests recognised by the Court of Augmentations following dissolution, the government&#x27;s apparent acquiescence to the granting of additional such rights helped establish a predisposition towards dissolution amongst tenants. At the same time, and especially once the loss of income from shrines and pilgrimages was taken into account, the long-term financial sustainability of many remaining houses was fragile.
Although Henry continued to maintain that his sole objective was monastic reform, in 1537 it became clear that official policy was the general extinction of monasticism in England and Wales. This extinction was now expected to be achieved through individual applications from superiors for voluntary surrender rather than through a systematic statutory dissolution. One Abbey whose monks had been implicated in the Pilgrimage of Grace was Furness in Lancashire. The abbot, fearful of a treason charge, petitioned to make a voluntary surrender of his house, which Cromwell happily approved. From then on, all dissolutions that were not a consequence of convictions for treason were legally &quot;voluntary&quot; – a principle that was taken a stage further with the voluntary surrender of Lewes priory in November 1537 when the monks were not accorded the option of transfer to another house, but with the additional motivation that from then on, ordinary monks were offered life pensions if they co-operated. Abbots and priors came under pressure from their communities to petition for voluntary surrender if they could obtain favourable terms for pensions; they also knew that if they refused to surrender, they might suffer the penalty for treason and their house would be dissolved anyway. Where the King had been able to establish himself as founder, he exploited his position to place compliant monks and nuns as the head of the house while non-royal patrons and founders also tended to press superiors for an early surrender, hoping to get preferential treatment in the disposal of monastic properties. From the beginning of 1538, Cromwell targeted the houses that he knew to be wavering in their resolve, cajoling and bullying their superiors to apply for surrender. Nevertheless, the public stance of the government was that the better-run houses could still expect to survive, and Cromwell dispatched a circular in March 1538 condemning false rumours of a general policy of dissolution while also warning superiors against asset-stripping or concealment of valuables, which could be construed as treasonable action.

===Second round of dissolutions===
As 1538 proceeded, applications for surrender flooded in. Cromwell appointed a local commissioner in each case to ensure rapid compliance with the King&#x27;s wishes, to supervise the orderly sale of monastic goods and buildings, to dispose of monastic endowments, and to ensure that the former monks and nuns were provided with pensions, cash gratuities and clothing. Existing tenants would have their tenancies continued, and lay office holders would continue to receive their incomes and fees (even without duties or obligations). Monks or nuns who were aged, handicapped or infirm were given more generous pensions, and care was taken throughout that there should be nobody cast out of their place unprovided for (who might otherwise have increased the burden of charity for local parishes). In a few instances, even monastic servants were provided with a year&#x27;s wages on discharge.

The endowments of landed property and appropriated parish tithes and glebe were transferred to the Court of Augmentations, who would pay out life pensions and fees at the agreed rate. Pensions averaged around £5 per annum before tax for monks, with those for superiors typically assessed at 10% of the net annual income of the house and were not reduced if the pensioner obtained other employment. If the pensioner accepted a royal appointment or benefice of greater annual value than their pension, the pension would be extinguished. In 1538, £5 compared with the annual wages of a skilled worker—and although the real value of such a fixed income would suffer through inflation—it remained a significant sum.

Pensions granted to nuns were less generous, averaging £3 per annum. During Henry&#x27;s reign, former nuns, like monks, continued to be forbidden to marry, therefore it is more possible that genuine hardship resulted, especially as former nuns had little access to opportunities for gainful employment. Where nuns came from well-born families, as many did, they seem commonly to have returned to live with their relatives. Otherwise, there were a number of instances where former nuns of a house clubbed together in a shared household. There were no retrospective pensions for those monks or nuns who had already sought secularisation following the 1535 visitation, nor for those members of the smaller houses dissolved in 1536 and 1537 who had not remained in the religious life, nor for those houses dissolved before 1538 due to the conviction for treason of their superior, and no friars were pensioned.

The future of the ten monastic cathedrals came into question. For two of these, Bath and Coventry, there was a second secular cathedral church in the same diocese, and both surrendered in 1539; but the other eight would necessarily need to continue in some form. It remained to determine what that form might be. A possible model was presented by the collegiate church of Stoke-by-Clare, Suffolk, where, in 1535 the evangelically minded Dean, Matthew Parker, had recast the college statutes away from the saying of chantry masses and towards preaching, observance of the office, and children&#x27;s education.

In May 1538, the monastic cathedral community of Norwich surrendered, adopting new collegiate statutes as secular priests along similar lines. The new foundation in Norwich provided for around half the number of clergies as had been monks in the former monastery, with a dean, five prebendaries and sixteen minor canons. This change corresponded with ideas of a reformed future for monastic communities that had been a subject of debate and speculation amongst leading Benedictine abbots for decades, and sympathetic voices were being heard from a number of quarters in the late summer of 1538.

The Lord Chancellor, Thomas Audley, proposed Colchester and St Osyth&#x27;s Priory as a possible future college. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk and Lord Treasurer proposed Thetford Priory, making extensive preparations to adopt statutes similar to those from Stoke-by-Clare, and expending substantial sums into moving shrines, relics and architectural fittings from the dissolved Castle Acre Priory into Thetford priory church. Cromwell himself proposed Little Walsingham (once purged of its &quot;superstitious&quot; shrine), and Hugh Latimer, the evangelical bishop of Worcester, wrote to Cromwell in 1538 to plead for the continuation of Great Malvern Priory, and of &quot;two or three in every shire of such remedy&quot;. By early 1539, the continuation of select great monasteries as collegiate refoundations had become an expectation. When the Second Suppression Act was presented to Parliament in May 1539, it was accompanied by an Act giving the King authority to establish new bishoprics and collegiate cathedral foundations. While the principle had been established, the numbers of successor colleges and cathedrals remained unspecified.

King Henry&#x27;s enthusiasm for creating new bishoprics was second to his passion for building fortifications. When an apparent alliance of France and the Holy Roman Empire against England was agreed at Toledo in January 1539, this precipitated a major invasion scare. Even though by midsummer the immediate danger had passed, Henry still demanded from Cromwell unprecedented sums for the coastal defence works from St Michael&#x27;s Mount to Lowestoft. The scale of the proposed new foundations was drastically cut back. In the end, six abbeys were raised to be cathedrals of new dioceses, and only two more major abbeys, Burton-on-Trent and Thornton, were re-founded as non-cathedral colleges. To the intense displeasure of Thomas Howard, Thetford was not spared, and was amongst the last houses to be dissolved in February 1540, while the Duke was out of the country on a hastily arranged embassy to France.

Even late in 1538, Cromwell himself appears to have hoped that a select group of nunneries might be spared, where they were able to demonstrate both a high quality of regular observance and a commitment to the principles of religious reform. One was Godstow Abbey near Oxford, whose abbess, Lady Katherine Bulkeley, was one whom Cromwell had personally promoted. Godstow was invaded by Dr John London, Cromwell&#x27;s commissioner, in October 1538, demanding the surrender of the abbey; but following a direct appeal to Cromwell himself, the house was assured that it could continue. Lady Katherine assured Cromwell that &quot;there is neither pope nor purgatory, image nor pilgrimage nor praying to dead saints used or regarded amongst us&quot;. Godstow Abbey was providing highly regarded boarding and schooling for girls of notable families. This was the case for several other nunneries, a factor which may have accounted for their surviving so long. Diarmaid MacCulloch further suggests that &quot;customary male cowardice&quot; was also a factor in the reluctance of the government to confront the heads of female religious houses. But the stay of execution for Godstow Abbey lasted just over a year: the abbey was suppressed in November 1539 along with all other nunnery survivors, as Henry was determined that none should continue.

===Later dissolutions===
None of the same legislation and visitation had applied to the houses of the friars. At the beginning of the 14th century there had been around 5,000 friars in England, occupying extensive complexes. There were still around 200 friaries in England at the dissolution. Except for the Observant Franciscans, by the 16th century the friars&#x27; income from donations had collapsed, their numbers had shrunk to less than 1,000 and their buildings were often ruinous or leased out commercially. No longer self-sufficient in food and with their cloistered spaces invaded by secular tenants, almost all friars were now living in rented lodgings outside their friaries and meeting for divine service in the friary church. Many friars now supported themselves through paid employment and held personal property.

By early 1538, suppression of the friaries was widely being anticipated. In some houses, all friars save the prior had already left, and assets (standing timber, chalices, vestments) were being sold off. Cromwell deputed Richard Yngworth, suffragan Bishop of Dover and former Provincial of the Dominicans, to obtain the friars&#x27; surrender, which he achieved rapidly by drafting new injunctions that enforced each order&#x27;s rules and required friars to resume a strict conventual life within their walls. Failure to accept voluntary surrender would then result in enforced homelessness and starvation. Once the friars agreed to surrender, Yngworth reported to Cromwell. He noted on his actions for each friary, who was the current tenant of each of the gardens, what was the general state of the buildings, and whether any church had valuable lead on roofs and gutters. Most of the friaries were in disrepair, with leased-out gardens as the only valuable asset.

Yngworth had no authority to dispose of lands and property and could not negotiate pensions. Therefore, the friars appear to have been released and dismissed with a gratuity of around 40 shillings each. Yngworth took this payout from whatever cash resources were in hand. He listed by name the friars remaining in each house at surrender so that Cromwell could provide them with legal permission to pursue careers as a secular priests. Furthermore, Yngworth had no discretion to maintain friary churches, even though many had continued to attract congregations. They were disposed of rapidly by the Court of Augmentations. Of all the friary churches in England and Wales, only St. Andrew&#x27;s Hall, Norwich, Atherstone Priory (Warwickshire), the Chichester Guildhall, and Greyfriars Church, Reading remain standing (although the London church of the Austin Friars continued in use by the Dutch Church until destroyed in the London Blitz). Almost all other friaries have disappeared with few visible traces.
In April 1539, Parliament passed a new law retrospectively legalising acts of voluntary surrender and assuring tenants of their continued rights, but by then the vast majority of monasteries in England and Wales had already been dissolved or marked out for a future as a collegiate foundation. Some still resisted, and that autumn the abbots of Colchester, Glastonbury, and Reading were hanged, drawn and quartered for treason, their houses being dissolved and their monks receiving a basic pension of £4 per year.

St Benet&#x27;s Abbey in Norfolk was the only abbey in England which escaped formal dissolution. As the last abbot had been appointed to the see of Norwich, the abbey endowments were transferred alongside him directly into those of the bishops. The last two abbeys to be dissolved were Shap Abbey, in January 1540, and Waltham Abbey, on 23 March 1540, and several priories also survived into 1540, including Bolton Priory in Yorkshire (dissolved 29 January 1540) and Thetford Priory in Norfolk (dissolved 16 February 1540). It was not until April 1540 that the cathedral priories of Canterbury and Rochester were transformed into secular cathedral chapters.

===Effects on public life===

The surrender of monastic endowments was recognised automatically as terminating all regular religious observance by its members, except in the case of a few communities, such as Syon, who went into exile. There are several recorded instances where groups of former members of a house set up residence together, but no cases where an entire community did so, and there is no indication that any continued to pray the Divine Office. The dissolution Acts were concerned solely with the disposal of endowed property, and never explicitly forbade the continuance of a regular life. Given Henry&#x27;s attitude to those religious who resumed their houses during the Pilgrimage of Grace, it would have been seen as unwise for any former community to maintain covert monastic observance.
The local commissioners were instructed to ensure that, where portions of abbey churches were also used by local parishes or congregations, this use should continue. Parts of 117 former monasteries survived (and mostly still remain) in use for parochial worship, in addition to the fourteen former monastic churches that survived in their entirety as cathedrals. In around a dozen instances, wealthy benefactors purchased a complete former monastic church from the commissioners and presented it to their local community. Many other parishes bought and installed former monastic woodwork, choir stalls and stained-glass windows. As it was commonly the case by the late medieval period that the abbot&#x27;s lodging had been expanded, these properties were frequently converted into country houses by lay purchasers. In other cases, such as Lacock Abbey and Forde Abbey, the conventual buildings themselves were converted to form the core of a Tudor great mansion. Otherwise, the most marketable fabric in monastic buildings was likely to be the lead on roofs, gutters and plumbing, and buildings were burned down as the easiest way to extract this. Building stone and slate were sold off to the highest bidder. Many monastic outbuildings were turned into granaries, barns and stables. Cromwell had already instigated a campaign against &quot;superstitions&quot;: pilgrimages and veneration of saints, during which ancient and precious valuables were grabbed and melted down, the tombs of saints and kings ransacked for whatever profit could be got from them, and their relics destroyed or dispersed. Even the crypt of King Alfred the Great was not spared. Great abbeys and priories like Glastonbury, Walsingham, Bury St Edmunds, and Shaftesbury, which had flourished as pilgrimage sites for many centuries, were soon reduced to ruins. However, the tales of widespread mob action resulting in destruction and iconoclasm partly confuses the looting spree of the 1530s with the vandalism wrought by the Puritans in the next century against the Anglican privileges. Woodward concludes:

Once the new and re-founded cathedrals and other endowments had been provided for, the Crown became richer to the extent of around £150,000 (), per year, although around £50,000 () of this was initially committed to fund monastic pensions. Cromwell had intended that the bulk of this wealth should serve as regular income. After Cromwell&#x27;s fall in 1540, Henry needed money quickly to fund his military ambitions in France and Scotland. Monastic property was sold off, representing by 1547 an annual value of £90,000 (). Lands and endowments were not offered for sale, let alone auctioned. Instead, the government responded to the flood of applications for purchase. Many applicants had been founders or patrons of the relevant houses and could expect to be successful. Purchasers were predominantly leading nobles, local magnates and gentry, people with no discernible religious tendency, other than a determination to maintain and extend their family&#x27;s local status. The landed property of the former monasteries included large numbers of manorial estates, each carrying the right and duty to hold a court for tenants and others. Acquiring such feudal rights was regarded as essential to establish a family in the late medieval gentry. For a long period, freehold manorial estates had been very rare in the market, and families seized on the opportunity now offered to entrench their positions. Nothing would subsequently induce them to surrender their new acquisitions. The Court of Augmentations retained income sufficient to meet its continuing obligations to pay annual pensions; but as pensioners died off, or as pensions were extinguished when their holders accepted a royal appointment of higher value, then surplus property became available each year for further disposal. The last surviving monks continued to draw their pensions into the reign of James I (1603–1625), more than 60 years after the dissolution.
The dissolution did not greatly affect English parish church activity. Parishes that had formerly paid their tithes to a religious house now paid them to a lay impropriator, but rectors, vicars, and other incumbents remained in place. Congregations that had shared monastic churches continued to do so, with former monastic parts now walled off and derelict. Most parish churches had been endowed with chantries, each maintaining a stipended priest to say Mass, and these were unaffected. In addition, there remained over a hundred collegiate churches in England, whose endowments maintained regular choral worship through a corporate body of canons, prebends or priests. All these survived the reign of Henry VIII largely intact, only to be dissolved under the Chantries Act 1547, by Henry&#x27;s son Edward VI, their property being absorbed into the Court of Augmentations and their members being added to the pensions list. Since many former monks had found employment as chantry priests, the consequence for these clerics was a double experience of dissolution, perhaps mitigated by the promise of a double pension.&#x27;

==Ireland ==
The dissolutions in Ireland followed a very different course from those in England and Wales. There were around 400 religious houses in Ireland in 1530—many more, relative to population and material wealth, than in England and Wales. In Ireland, the houses of friars had flourished in the 15th century, attracting popular support and financial endowments, undertaking many ambitious building schemes, and maintaining a regular conventual and spiritual life. Friaries constituted around half of the total number of religious houses. Irish monasteries, by contrast, had experienced a catastrophic decline in numbers, such that by the 16th century only a minority maintained the daily observance of the Divine Office. Henry&#x27;s direct authority, as Lord of Ireland and, from 1541, as King of Ireland, only extended to the area of the Pale immediately around Dublin. Outside this area, he could only proceed by tactical agreement with clan chiefs and local lords.
Henry was determined to carry through a policy of dissolution in Ireland—and in 1537 he introduced legislation into the Irish Parliament to legalise the closure of monasteries. The process faced considerable opposition, and only sixteen houses were suppressed. Henry remained resolute, and from 1541 as part of the Tudor conquest of Ireland he continued to press for more. For the most part, this involved making deals with local lords, under which monastic property was granted away in exchange for allegiance to the new Irish Crown. Henry acquired little (if any) of the wealth of the Irish houses.

By the time of Henry&#x27;s death (1547) around half of the Irish houses had been suppressed, but many continued to resist dissolution until the reign of Elizabeth I, and some houses in the West of Ireland remained active until the early 17th century. In 1649, Oliver Cromwell led a Parliamentary army to conquer Ireland, and systematically sought out and destroyed former monastic houses. Subsequently, sympathetic landowners housed monks or friars close to several ruined religious houses, allowing them a continued covert existence during the 17th and 18th centuries, subject to the dangers of discovery and legal ejection or imprisonment.

==Consequences==

===Social and economic===

The abbeys of England, Wales, and Ireland had been among the greatest landowners and the largest institutions in the kingdoms, although by the early 16th century, religious donors tended to favour parish churches, collegiate churches, university colleges and grammar schools, and these were now the predominant centres for learning and the arts. Nevertheless, particularly in rural areas, the abbeys, convents and priories were centres of hospitality and learning, and everywhere they remained a source of charity for the old and infirm. The removal of over eight hundred such institutions left great gaps in the social fabric.

About a quarter of net monastic wealth consisted of &quot;spiritual&quot; income arising where the religious house held the advowson (right to appoint) a benefice with the legal obligation to maintain the cure of souls in the parish, originally by nominating the rector and taking an annual rental payment. Over the medieval period, monasteries and priories continually sought papal exemptions, so as to personally use the glebe and tithe income of rectoral benefices in their possession. From the 13th century onwards, English diocesan bishops successfully established the principle that only the glebe and &#x27;greater tithes&#x27; of grain, hay and wood could be appropriated by monastic patrons in this manner; the &#x27;lesser tithes&#x27; had to remain within the parochial benefice, the incumbent of which carried the title of &#x27;vicar&#x27;. By 1535, of 8,838 rectories, 3,307 had thus been appropriated with vicarages, but at this late date, a small sub-set of vicarages in monastic ownership were not being served by beneficed clergy at all. These were parish churches owned by houses of Augustinian or Premonstratensian canons, orders whose rules required them to provide parochial worship within their conventual churches. From the mid-fourteenth century onwards, the canons had been able to exploit their hybrid status to justify petitions for papal privileges of appropriation, allowing them to fill vicarages in their possession either from among their own number, or from secular priests removable at will.

On the dissolution these spiritual income streams were sold off on the same basis as landed endowments, creating a new class of lay impropriators, who became entitled to patronage, and the income from tithes and glebe lands. Though as lay rectors, they had to maintain the fabric of the parish chancel. The existing rectors and vicars serving parish churches (formerly monastic property) were unaffected. However, in unclaimed canons&#x27; parish churches and chapels, the lay rector (as patron) was obliged to establish a stipend for a perpetual curate effectively from their own income.

It is unlikely that the monastic system could have been broken simply by royal action, had there not been the overwhelming bait of enhanced status for gentry, and the convictions of the small but determined Protestant faction. Anti-clericalism was a familiar feature of late medieval Europe, producing its own strain of satiric literature that was aimed at a literate middle class.

===Arts and culture===
Along with the destruction of the monasteries, some centuries old, the destruction of their libraries was perhaps the greatest cultural loss caused by the English Reformation. Worcester Priory (now Worcester Cathedral) had 600 books at the time of the dissolution. Only six of them are known to have survived intact to the present day. At the abbey of the Augustinian Friars at York, a library of 646 volumes was destroyed, leaving only three known survivors. Some books were destroyed for their precious bindings, others were sold off by the cartload. The antiquarian John Leland was commissioned by the King to rescue items of particular interest (especially manuscript sources of Old English history), and other collections were made by private individuals, notably Matthew Parker. Nevertheless, much was lost, especially manuscript books of English church music, none of which had then been printed.

===Health and education===
The Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1539 also provided for the suppression of religious hospitals, which had constituted in England a distinct class of institution, endowed for the purpose of caring for older people. Very few of these, such as Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London (which still exists, though it took a different name between 1546 and 1948), were exempted by special royal dispensation but most closed, their residents being discharged with small pensions.

Monasteries had also supplied free food and alms for the poor and destitute, and it has been argued that the removal of this and other charitable resources, amounting to about 5 per cent of net monastic income, was one of the factors in the creation of the army of &quot;sturdy beggars&quot; that plagued late Tudor England, part of the social instability that led to the Edwardian and Elizabethan Poor Laws. This argument has been disputed, for example, by G. W. O. Woodward, who summarises:


Monasteries had undertaken schooling for their novice members, which in the later medieval period had tended to extend to choristers and sometimes other younger scholars. Where monasteries had provided grammar schools for older scholars, these were commonly refounded with enhanced endowments; some by royal command in connection with the newly re-established cathedral churches, others by private initiative. Monastic orders had maintained, for the education of their members, six colleges at the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, of which five survived as refoundations. Hospitals too were frequently to be re-endowed by private benefactors; and many new almshouses and charities were to be founded by the Elizabethan gentry and professional classes (London Charterhouse/Charterhouse School being an example which still survives). Nevertheless, it has been estimated that only in 1580 did overall levels of charitable giving in England return to those before the dissolution. On the eve of the overthrow, the various monasteries owned approximately , over 16 percent of England, with tens of thousands of tenant farmers working those lands, some of whom had family ties to a particular monastery.

===Religion===
It has been argued that the suppression of the English monasteries and nunneries contributed to the spreading decline of a contemplative spirituality which once thrived in Europe, with the occasional exception found only in groups such as the Society of Friends (&quot;Quakers&quot;). This may be set against the retained and newly established cathedrals of the daily singing of the Divine Office by choristers and vicars choral, now undertaken as public worship, which had not been the case before the dissolution. The deans and prebends of the six new cathedrals were overwhelmingly former heads of religious houses. The secularised former monks and friars commonly looked for re-employment as parish clergy; and consequently, numbers of new ordinations dropped drastically in the ten years after the dissolution and ceased almost entirely in the reign of Edward VI. It was only in 1549, after Edward came to the throne, that former monks and nuns were permitted to marry. Within a year of permission being granted, only around a quarter had done so, only to find themselves forcibly separated (and denied their pensions) in the reign of Mary. On the succession of Elizabeth, these former monks and friars (reunited both with their wives and their pensions) formed a major part of the new Anglican church and may properly claim credit for maintaining the religious life of the country until a new generation of ordinands became available in the 1560s and 1570s.

In the medieval church, there had been no seminaries or other institutions dedicated to training men as parish clergy. An aspiring candidate for ordination, having acquired a grammar school education and appropriate experience, would have been presented to the bishop&#x27;s commissary for examination. Candidates were sponsored by an ecclesiastical corporation which provided him with a &#x27;title&#x27;, a notional patrimony assuring the bishop of his financial security. By the 16th century, the sponsors were overwhelmingly religious houses, although monasteries provided no formal parochial training, and the financial &#x27;title&#x27; was a legal fiction. With the rapid expansion of grammar school provision in the late medieval period, the numbers of men being presented each year for ordination greatly exceeded the number of benefices falling vacant through the death of the incumbent priest. Consequently most newly ordained parish clergy could only expect to succeed to a benefice after many years as a Mass priest of low social standing.

In the knowledge that alternative arrangements for sponsorship and title would now need to be made, the dissolution legislation provided that the lay and ecclesiastical successors of the monks in former monastic endowments could provide valid title for ordinands. These new arrangements appear to have taken a considerable period to gain acceptance, and the circumstances of the church in the late 1530s may not have encouraged candidates to come forward. For 20 years afterwards (until the succession of Elizabeth I), the number of ordinands in every diocese in England and Wales fell drastically. At the same time, the restrictions on &#x27;pluralism&#x27; introduced through legislation in 1529 prevented the accumulation of multiple benefices by individual clergy, and accordingly by 1559 some 10% of benefices were vacant and former reserve Mass priests had been absorbed into the ranks of beneficed clergy. Monastic successors preferred to sponsor university graduates as candidates for the priesthood; and, although the government failed to respond to the consequent need for expanded educational provision, individual benefactors stepped into the breach, with the refoundation as university colleges of five out of the six former monastic colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. Jesus College, Oxford and Emmanuel College, Cambridge were newly founded with the express purpose of educating a Protestant parish clergy. One unintended long-term consequence of the dissolution was the transformation of the parish clergy in England and Wales into an educated professional class of secure, beneficed incumbents of distinctly higher social standing. Through intermarriage of one another&#x27;s children, this social group became substantially self-perpetuating.
Even while it had been stated that King&#x27;s increased riches would make it possible to build or better fund religious, philanthropic, and educational institutions, only around 15% of the monastic money was used this way. This included refounding eight out of nine previous monastic cathedrals (Coventry being the exception), as well as six completely new bishoprics (Bristol, Chester, Gloucester, Oxford, Peterborough, Westminster) with their associated cathedrals, chapters, choirs, and grammar schools; refounding monastic institutions at Brecon, Thornton, and Burton on Trent as secular colleges; endowing five Regius Professorships at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge; the endowment of the colleges of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Christ Church, Oxford; and the maritime charity of Trinity House. Thomas Cranmer objected to the provision of the new cathedrals with complete chapters of prebendaries at high stipends, but against pressure to ensure that well-paid posts would continue, his protests had no effect. On the other hand, Cranmer ensured that the new grammar schools attached both to &#x27;New Foundation&#x27; and &#x27;Old Foundation&#x27; cathedrals should be well funded, and accessible to boys from all walks of life. The Court of Augmentations retained around a third of the overall monastic income since it was necessary to continue making pension payments to former monks and nuns. Just over half of the remaining property was left to be offered for sale at market prices (Henry gave away very little property to favored staff, and what he did give away tended to return to the Crown after its beneficiaries fell out of favor and were charged with treason). The English and Welsh dissolutions produced a comparatively small amount of new educational endowments compared to the violent closure of monasteries elsewhere in Protestant Europe, but the treatment of former monks and nuns was more benevolent, and there was no analogue to the mechanisms established in England to maintain pension payments over successive decades.

===Politics===
The dissolution and destruction of the monasteries and shrines was very unpopular in many areas. In the north of England, centering on Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, the suppression led to a popular rising, the Pilgrimage of Grace, that threatened the Crown for some weeks. In 1536, there were major, popular uprisings in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire and a further rising in Norfolk the following year. James Clark claims in &quot;The Dissolution of the Monasteries&quot;:

There were rumors that the King would tax livestock and calves in addition to stripping parish churches. The rebels demanded that Cromwell be removed and that the monasteries remain untouched. Henry used promises to calm the unrest before swiftly beheading some of the leaders.

When Henry VIII&#x27;s Catholic daughter, Mary I, succeeded to the throne in 1553, her hopes for a revival of English religious life proved a failure. Westminster Abbey, which had been retained as a cathedral, reverted to being a monastery; while the communities of the Bridgettine nuns and of the Observant Franciscans, which had gone into exile in the reign of Henry VIII, returned to their former houses at Syon and Greenwich respectively. A small group of fifteen surviving Carthusians was re-established in their old house at Sheen, as were eight Dominican canonesses in Dartford. A house of Dominican friars was established at Smithfield, but this was only possible through importing professed religious from Holland and Spain, and Mary&#x27;s hopes of further refoundations foundered, as she found it very difficult to persuade former monks and nuns to resume the religious life. Schemes for restoring the abbeys at Glastonbury and St Albans failed for lack of volunteers. All the refounded houses were in properties that had remained in Crown possession. None of Mary&#x27;s lay supporters would co-operate in returning their holdings of monastic lands to religious use. Lay lords in Parliament proved unremittingly hostile, as a revival of the &quot;mitred&quot; abbeys would have returned the House of Lords to having an ecclesiastical majority. There remained a widespread suspicion that the return of religious communities to their former premises might unsettle the legal title of lay purchasers of monastic land, and accordingly all Mary&#x27;s foundations were technically new communities in law. In 1554, Cardinal Pole the papal legate, negotiated a papal dispensation allowing the new owners to retain the former monastic lands, and in return Parliament enacted the heresy laws in January 1555. When Mary died in 1558 and was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth I, five of the six revived communities left again to exile in continental Europe. An Act of Elizabeth&#x27;s first parliament dissolved the refounded houses. But although Elizabeth offered to allow the monks in Westminster to remain in place with restored pensions if they took the Oath of Supremacy and conformed to the new Book of Common Prayer, all refused and dispersed unpensioned. In less than 20 years, the monastic impulse had effectively been extinguished in England; and was only revived, even amongst Catholics, in the very different form of Counter-Reformation orders, such as the Jesuits.

<text>The Neverhood (released in Japan as Klaymen Klaymen:The Mystery of Neverhood) is a 1996 point-and-click adventure video game developed by The Neverhood, Inc. and published by DreamWorks Interactive for Microsoft Windows. The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets. The gameplay consists mostly of guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance. Video sequences help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, &quot;The Neverhood&quot; aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence. The game has garnered a cult following. It received a sequel in 1998, &quot;Skullmonkeys&quot;, which was a platform game, abandoning the adventure format of the original.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;The Neverhood&quot; is a point-and-click adventure game which emphasizes the solving of puzzles through character action rather than inventory usage. Klaymen must use the available environment in order to advance in the game, with the standard inventory being quasi-absent. There are possible gameovers if the player is not careful enough, with one where the game cannot be restored from a previous save and must be restarted.

== Plot ==
The titular Neverhood is a surreal landscape dotted with buildings and other hints of life, all suspended above an endless void. However, the Neverhood itself is strangely deserted, with its only inhabitants being Klaymen (the main protagonist and player character), Willie Trombone (a dim individual who assists Klaymen in his travels), Klogg (the game&#x27;s antagonist who resembles a warped version of Klaymen), and various fauna that inhabit the Neverhood (most infamously the &#x27;weasels&#x27;, monstrous, crablike creatures that pursue Klaymen and Willie at certain points in the game). Much of the game&#x27;s background information is limited to the &#x27;Hall Of Records&#x27; which is notorious for its length, taking several minutes to travel from one end of the hall to the other.

The game begins with Klaymen waking up in a room and exploring the Neverhood, collecting various discs appearing to contain a disjointed story narrated by Willie (which Klaymen can view through various terminals scattered throughout the land). As Klaymen travels the Neverhood, he occasionally crosses paths with Willie, who agrees to help him in his journey, while Klogg spies on them from afar. Eventually, Klaymen&#x27;s quest directs him to Klogg&#x27;s castle, and for this Klaymen enlists the help of Big Robot Bil, a towering automaton and a friend of Willie&#x27;s. As Bil (with Klaymen and Willie on board) marches to Klogg&#x27;s castle, Klogg unleashes his guardian, the Clockwork Beast, to intercept Bil. The two giants clash and Bil proves victorious, but as he forces open the castle door for Klaymen to enter, Klogg gravely injures Bil by firing a cannon at him. Klaymen manages to get in, but Bil loses his footing and falls into the void with Willie still inside. 

Alone in Klogg&#x27;s castle, Klaymen finds the last of Willie&#x27;s discs, revealing the full context of his tale: The Neverhood itself is the creation of a godlike being named Hoborg, who created the Neverhood in the hopes of making himself happy. Realizing that he was still alone, Hoborg created himself a companion by planting a seed into the ground, which grew into Klogg. As Hoborg welcomed Klogg to the Neverhood, the latter tried to take Hoborg&#x27;s crown, which Hoborg forbade Klogg from doing. Envious, Klogg managed to steal Hoborg&#x27;s crown, rendering Hoborg inert in the process, and the crown&#x27;s energies disfigured Klogg. With Hoborg lifeless, any further development of the Neverhood ground to a halt. Having witnessed this, Willie (himself and Bil being creations of Hoborg&#x27;s brother Ottoborg) discovered that Hoborg was about to plant a seed to create another companion. Willie took the seed and planted it far away from Klogg, with Willie hoping that whoever grew from the seed would defeat Klogg: That seed in turn grew into Klaymen. 

The story ends with Willie giving Klaymen the throne room key through the terminal screen, hoping that Klaymen knows what to do once he confronts Klogg. Afterwards, Klaymen manages to enter the throne room, with Klogg and a motionless Hoborg waiting for him. Klogg tries to dissuade Klaymen from reviving Hoborg by tempting him with Hoborg&#x27;s crown. 

From here, the player may choose to take up Klogg&#x27;s offer or take the crown to revive Hoborg:
* If the player chooses to take the crown for himself, Klogg gloats at his apparent victory, only for the now-villainous Klaymen, crowned and disfigured (similarly to Klogg), to instantly overpower Klogg and declare himself the new ruler of the Neverhood.
* If the player chooses to revive Hoborg, Klaymen distracts Klogg and manages to put the crown atop Hoborg&#x27;s head, reviving him. As Hoborg thanks Klaymen, Klogg attempts to ambush them both, only to set off his own cannon which blasts him out of the castle and into the void. Returning to the building where Klaymen first started, Hoborg continues populating the Neverhood and orders a celebration when he is finished. However, Klaymen remains sorrowful over the loss of Willie and Bil, and Hoborg decides to use his powers to save Willie and Bil (to Klaymen&#x27;s delight), and the game ends with Hoborg telling Klaymen &quot;Man, things are good&quot;.

== Development ==
Doug TenNapel came up with the idea of a plasticine world in 1988, creating approximately 17 structures. Due to his dissatisfaction with the way David Perry ran Shiny Entertainment, TenNapel left the company in 1995. Two weeks later he announced at E3 that he started his own company, The Neverhood, Inc., which consisted of a number of people who worked on the&quot; Earthworm Jim&quot; game and its sequel. Steven Spielberg&#x27;s DreamWorks Interactive, which had recently started, needed fresh and unusual projects and TenNapel approached Spielberg with the idea of a claymation game, with Spielberg accepting it for publication. The Neverhood, Inc. made a deal with DreamWorks Interactive and Microsoft, and the game went for development. According to the developers, creating the game&#x27;s characters and scenery used up over three tons of clay. &quot;The Neverhood&quot; was shown at E3 1996 under the title &quot;The Neverhood: A Curious Wad of Klay Finds His Soul&quot;.

After a year of work, &quot;The Neverhood&quot; was finally released to the public in 1996. The game elements were shot entirely on beta versions of the Minolta RD-175, making &quot;The Neverhood&quot; the first stop-motion production to use consumer digital cameras for professional use.

== Soundtrack ==
The game&#x27;s soundtrack was composed and performed by Daniel Amos frontman Terry Scott Taylor and went on to win &quot;GMR&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Game Music of the Year&quot; award. Tom Clancy&#x27;s video game composer Bill Brown called &quot;The Neverhood&quot; Soundtrack, &quot;The Best of any of them (video game soundtracks).&quot;

== Ports and legacy ==
A PlayStation port of the game titled &quot;Klaymen Klaymen&quot;: &quot;The Mystery of the Neverhood&quot; was made and released to Japanese audiences only. The game had some minor changes to the PC version such as longer loading times between rooms and the removal of The Hall of Records area. The Japanese release of &quot;Skullmonkeys&quot;, in turn, was titled &quot;Klaymen Klaymen 2&quot;.

In June 2011, it was announced via Facebook and Twitter that some of the original developers of &quot;The Neverhood&quot; were negotiating for exclusive rights to release the game on modern platforms such as iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, Android phones, Android tablets and Windows Phones.

As official support had ceased, e.g. updates for modern OS and hardware, a fan group created new compatibility fixes in the &quot;Neverhood restoration project&quot; in 2013.

On July 21, 2014, ScummVM version 1.7.0 was released by the ScummVM project which added support for &quot;The Neverhood&quot;, allowing it to run on many supported platforms including Linux, OS X, Windows and Android OS.

According to PC Gamer the game is abandoned.

== Reception ==
=== Sales ===
According to Leslie Helm of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Neverhood&quot; &quot;won rave reviews&quot; but was commercially unsuccessful. In early 1997, that paper&#x27;s Greg Miller reported that the game&#x27;s &quot;sales have been slow and [it] isn&#x27;t even carried by all of the largest stores, including Target.&quot; This came at a time when big-box stores were increasingly important for securing sales, as many specialized video game retailers had closed due to competition with these outside companies. By August 1997, &quot;The Neverhood&quot; had sold 37,000 copies in the United States. Sales in the region had risen to 41,073 copies by April 1999, a figure that CNET Gamecenter&#x27;s Marc Saltzman called &quot;embarrassing&quot;.

&quot;The Neverhood&quot;″s total sales ultimately surpassed 50,000 copies, and &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of OEM copies were purchased by Gateway and pre-installed on its line of computers, according to Mike Dietz. It also received a huge fan base in Russia and Iran as a result of the massive bootleg copying and distribution of pre-installed games on computers.

=== Critical reviews ===
A &quot;Next Generation&quot; critic was pleased with both the visual style (which he said is essentially unprecedented on PC) and the execution of the graphics, but found the game is held back by unexciting puzzles and a generally slow pace. &quot;GameSpot&quot; likewise stated that the game has endearing visuals but is held back by the puzzles. However, rather than being dull, they judged the puzzles to be unfairly difficult and frustrating, remarking that &quot;Clues are so abstract they will lead you to despair.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; contradicted, &quot;While some of the puzzles are perplexing, none of them have solutions so obscure that you&#x27;ll burst a blood vessel trying to solve them.&quot; However, they agreed that the graphics and the personality of the characters are the highlights of the game. &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; gave the PlayStation version a score of 29 out of 40.

&quot;The Neverhood&quot; was named the best adventure game of 1996 by &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; and CNET Gamecenter, and was nominated for the latter publication&#x27;s overall &quot;Game of the Year&quot; prize, which ultimately went to &quot;Quake&quot;. Gamecenter&#x27;s editors wrote that it &quot;went beyond anything seen so far in this genre&quot;. The game also won the 1996 &quot;Special Award for Artistic Achievement&quot; from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, whose staff called it &quot;the coolest-looking game of the year.&quot; While &quot;The Neverhood&quot; was nominated for the Computer Game Developers Conference&#x27;s &quot;Best Animation&quot; Spotlight Award, it lost in this category to &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;.

&quot;Animation Magazine&quot;″s film festival &quot;World Animation Celebration&quot; awarded the game &quot;Best Animation Produced for Game Platforms&quot; in 1997.

In 2011, Adventure Gamers named &quot;The Neverhood&quot; the 35th-best adventure game ever released.

== Sequels ==
A sequel to &quot;The Neverhood&quot; was released in 1998 for the PlayStation, entitled &quot;Skullmonkeys&quot;. It was not a point-and-click adventure game like the first installment, but rather a platform game.

Following the sequel, another Japanese PlayStation game set in the Neverhood universe called &quot;Klaymen Gun-Hockey&quot; was made. A Japan-only sports action game, it was based on the characters of the Neverhood, but was not developed by the designers of the original games; it also did not feature the previous releases&#x27; distinctive Claymation design techniques. The game is a variation on air hockey, only played with guns instead of mallets. It was developed and published by Riverhillsoft, the publisher of Japanese releases of the Neverhood series.

Klaymen is featured as a secret fighter for the PlayStation game &quot;BoomBots&quot;, also developed by The Neverhood, Inc.

On March 12, 2013, TenNapel announced that he had partnered with former &quot;Neverhood&quot; and &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; artists/animators Ed Schofield and Mike Dietz of Pencil Test Studios to develop a &quot;clay and stop-motion animated point and click adventure game&quot;. While stating that the game would not be a sequel to &quot;The Neverhood&quot;, TenNapel reiterated that the game would consist of his unique art style and sense of humor, and have an original soundtrack by Terry Scott Taylor. The game was titled &quot;Armikrog&quot;, which was released on September 30, 2015.

==&quot;Return to the Neverhood&quot;==
In 2012, the authors of the original &quot;Neverhood&quot; released a musical novel, &quot;Return to the Neverhood&quot;. The story and soundtrack were written by Terry Scott Taylor, and the illustrations were drawn by Doug TenNapel.

== Cancelled film ==
On June 25, 2007, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that one of Frederator Films&#x27; first projects would be a claymation feature film adaptation based on &quot;The Neverhood&quot;. Doug TenNapel, the creator of the video game, signed on to write and direct the film.
However, the movie was cancelled due to a lack of funding.

<doc id="95218" wikidata="Q248874" url="?curid=95218" title="Browning Hi-Power">
<text>The Browning Hi-Power is a single-action, semi-automatic pistol available in the 9×19mm Parabellum and .40 S&amp;W calibers. It was based on a design by American firearms inventor John Browning, and completed by Dieudonné Saive at FN Herstal. Browning died in 1926, several years before the design was finalized. FN Herstal named it the &quot;High Power&quot; in allusion to the 13-round magazine capacity, almost twice that of other designs at the time, such as the Walther P38 or Colt M1911.

During World War II, Belgium was occupied by Nazi Germany and the FN factory was used by the Wehrmacht to build the pistols for their military, under the designation &quot;9mm Pistole 640(b)&quot;. FN Herstal continued to build guns for the Allied forces by moving their production line to a John Inglis and Company plant in Canada, where the name was changed to &quot;Hi Power&quot;. The name change was kept even after production returned to Belgium. The pistol is often referred to as an HP or BHP, and the terms P-35 and HP-35 are also used, based on the introduction of the pistol in 1935. Other names include GP (after the French term &quot;grande puissance&quot;) or BAP (Browning Automatic Pistol). The Hi-Power is one of the most widely used military pistols in history, having been used by the armed forces of over 50 countries. Although most pistols were built in Belgium by FN Herstal, licensed and unlicensed copies were built around the world, in countries such as Argentina, Hungary, India, Bulgaria, and Israel.

After 82 years of continuous production, FN Herstal announced that the production of the Hi-Power would end, and it was discontinued in early 2018 by Browning Arms. From 2019 to 2022, with new Belgian Hi-Powers no longer being built, new clones were designed by various firearm companies to fill the void, including GİRSAN, TİSAŞ, and Springfield Armory, Inc. These new Hi-Power clones began competing with each other by offering new finishes, enhanced sights, redesigned hammers, bevelled magazine wells, improved trigger, and increased magazine capacity.

In 2022, FN announced they would resume production of the Browning Hi-Power. The 2022 &quot;FN High Power&quot; incorporated a number of entirely new features such as a fully ambidextrous slide lock, simplified takedown method, enlarged ejection port, reversible magazine release, wider slide serrations, different colored finish offerings, and 17-round magazines. In contrast to popular belief, the new FN High Power might resemble a modern Hi-Power, but it is, in fact, a different design. One of the noticeable details is the lack of Browning-style locking lugs.

==History==

===Development===
The Browning Hi-Power was designed in response to a French military requirement for a new service pistol, the &quot;Grand Rendement&quot; (French for &quot;high efficiency&quot;), or alternatively &quot;Grande Puissance&quot; (literally &quot;high power&quot;). The French military required that:
* The gun must be compact.
* The magazine have a capacity of at least 10 rounds.
* The gun have a magazine disconnect device, an external hammer, and a positive safety.
* The gun be robust and simple to disassemble and reassemble.
* The gun be capable of killing a man at .

This last criterion was seen to demand a caliber of or larger, a bullet mass of around , and a muzzle velocity of . It was to accomplish all of this at a weight not exceeding .

FN commissioned John Browning to design a new military sidearm conforming to this specification. Browning had previously sold the rights to his successful M1911 U.S. Army automatic pistol to Colt&#x27;s Patent Firearms, and was therefore forced to design an entirely new pistol while working around the M1911 patents. Browning built two different prototypes for the project in Utah and filed the patent for this pistol in the United States on 28 June 1923, granted on 22 February 1927. One was a simple blowback design, while the other was operated with a locked-breech recoil system. Both prototypes utilised the new staggered magazine design (by designer Dieudonné Saive) to increase capacity without unduly increasing the pistol&#x27;s grip size or magazine length.

The locked breech design was selected for further development and testing. This model was striker-fired, and featured a double-stack magazine that held 16 rounds. The design was refined through several trials held by the Versailles Trial Commission.

In 1928, when the patents for the Colt Model 1911 had expired, Dieudonné Saive integrated many of the Colt&#x27;s previously patented features into the Saive-Browning Model of that same year. This version featured the removable barrel bushing and take down sequence of the Colt 1911.

In 1929, as an effort to find an alternative solution to the long-ongoing French trials, and with a pistol that they considered by then to be good enough to stand on its own to find other potential clients, FN decided to announce the &quot;Grand Rendement&quot;, incorporating a shortened 13-round magazine, for sale in their commercial catalogue. They hoped to find a military contract which would in turn help them finance a production line, essentially through the same process as their previous FN M1900 pistol.

By 1931, the Browning Hi-Power design incorporated the same 13-round magazine, a curved rear grip strap, and a barrel bushing that was integral to the slide assembly. The Belgian Army showed a definite interest and bought 1,000 pistols based on this prototype for field trials.

By 1934, the Hi-Power design was complete and ready to be produced. Ultimately, France decided not to adopt the pistol, instead selecting the conceptually similar but lower-capacity Modèle 1935 pistol. However, it was good enough to stand on its own as a service pistol for the Belgian Army and other clients. These would become the Grande Puissance, known as the High Power, in Belgium for military service in 1935 as the Browning P-35.

===Military service and widespread use===
Browning Hi-Power pistols were used during World War II by both Allied and Axis forces. After occupying Belgium in 1940, German forces took over the FN plant. German troops subsequently used the Hi-Power, having assigned it the designation &quot;Pistole&quot; 640(b) (&quot;b&quot; for &quot;belgisch&quot;, &quot;Belgian&quot;). Examples produced by FN in Belgium under German occupation bear German inspection and acceptance marks, or &quot;Waffenamts&quot;, such as &quot;WaA613&quot;. In German service, it was used mainly by Waffen-SS and personnel.

High-Power pistols were also produced in Canada for Allied use, by John Inglis and Company in Toronto. The plans were sent from the FN factory to the UK when it became clear the Belgian plant would fall into German hands, enabling the Inglis factory to be tooled up for Hi-Power production for Allied use. Inglis produced two versions of the Hi-Power, one with an adjustable rear sight and detachable shoulder stock (primarily for a Nationalist Chinese contract) and one with a fixed rear sight. Production began in late 1944 and they were on issue by the March 1945 Operation Varsity airborne crossing of the Rhine into Germany. The pistol was popular with the British airborne forces as well as covert operations and commando groups such as the Special Operations Executive (SOE), the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and the British Special Air Service (SAS) Regiment. 

Inglis High-Powers made for Commonwealth forces have the British designation &#x27;Mk 1&#x27; or &#x27;Mk 1*&#x27; and the manufacturer&#x27;s details on the left of the slide. They were known in British and Commonwealth service as the &#x27;Pistol No 2 Mk 1&#x27;, or &#x27;Pistol No 2 Mk 1*&#x27; where applicable. Serial numbers were 6 characters, the second being the letter &#x27;T&#x27;, e.g. 1T2345. Serial numbers on pistols for the Chinese contract instead used the letters &#x27;CH&#x27;, but otherwise followed the same format. When the Chinese contract was cancelled, all undelivered Chinese-style pistols were accepted by the Canadian military with designations of &#x27;Pistol No 1 Mk 1&#x27; and &#x27;Pistol No 1 Mk 1*&#x27;.

In the postwar period, Hi-Power production continued at the FN factory and as part of FN&#x27;s product range, which included the FN FAL rifle and FN MAG general-purpose machine gun. It has been adopted as the standard service pistol by over 50 armies in 93 countries. At one time most NATO nations used it, and it was standard issue to forces throughout the British Commonwealth. It was manufactured under licence, or in some cases cloned, on several continents. Former Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein often carried a Browning Hi-Power. Former Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi carried a gold-plated Hi-Power with his own face design on the left side of the grip which was waved around in the air by Libyan rebels after his death. A Hi-Power was used by Mehmet Ali Agca during the assassination attempt of Pope John Paul II in 1981.

===Decline and resurgence===
While the Hi-Power remains an excellent and iconic design, since the early 1990s it has been eclipsed somewhat by more modern designs which are often double-action with aluminum alloy frames and are manufactured using more modern methods. However, even to this day, the Hi-Power remains in service throughout the world. As of 2017, the MK1 version remained the standard service pistol of the Canadian Armed Forces, with the SIG Sauer P226 being issued to specialised units along with the SIG Sauer P225. The weapon is the standard sidearm of the Belgian Army, Indian Army, Indonesian Armed Forces, Australian Defence Force, Argentine Army, Luxembourg Armed Forces, Israel Police, and Venezuelan Army, among others. The Irish Army replaced its Browning Pistols (known popularly as BAPs, or Browning Automatic Pistols) with the Heckler &amp; Koch USP in 2007. From 2013 the British Army is replacing the Browning with the polymer-framed Glock 17 Gen 4 pistol, due to concerns about weight and the external safety of the pistol.

In 2018, FN announced they would end production of the Mark III Hi-Power, which was expensive to produce and had been assembled in Portugal to cut costs. Early in that year, Browning officially ceased production of the Belgian Hi-Power for the first time since 1935. An unlicensed clone called the &quot;Regent BR9&quot; was produced in Turkey by TİSAŞ in 2019 and had gained some popularity now that authentic Hi-Powers were no longer being made and surplus Hi-Powers from other countries like Hungary and Argentina had dried up. The Regent BR9 design was more of a copy of the Mark I design, but did offer some modern design features, like a Cerakote or stainless steel finish and Novak-style sights. The BR9 was soon discontinued, but, in 2021, another Turkish company called GİRSAN began producing their own Hi-Power clone called the MCP35, imported by EAA. In 2021, American firearms company Springfield Armory announced their own Hi-Power clone, the SA-35. GİRSAN and Springfield Armory&#x27;s clones began competing with each other by offering new design improvements that would help them compete in the oversaturated defensive handgun market. GİRSAN&#x27;s MCP35 attempted to replicate the Mark III design as closely as possible, including the Belgian-style ambidextrous thumb safety, Mark III-style sights with a windage drift adjustable rear sight and dovetailed front sight, and Mark III-style black polymer grips. The MCP35 also retained the Belgian magazine disconnect safety. However, the MCP35 incorporated the original ring hammer design instead of the claw hammer design of the Mark III and also incorporated some design elements to appeal to the modern shooter, such as a 15-round Mec-Gar magazine and Cerakote finish.
The steady competition between the MCP35 and the SA-35 to make the original Hi-Power relevant to the market stirred up a great interest among both Hi-Power fans and new shooters. On 18 January 2022, after a four-year hiatus, FN announced they would resume production of the Browning Hi-Power, albeit with a number of upgraded features. FN named the 2022 redesign the &quot;FN High Power&quot; and incorporated a number of features to help it compete with the improved Hi-Power clones being made by GİRSAN and Springfield Armory. FN incorporated a number of changes that would make the classic Hi-Power design more modern and ergonomic. The most significant changes included opening up the top of the slide to increase the size of the ejection port to ensure reliable feeding and ejection, incorporating an ambidextrous slide lock and reversible magazine release, a completely different takedown that is faster and simpler, and redesigning the barrel and recoil spring. Other changes FN made include removing the magazine disconnect safety, adding an extended beavertail and redesigned hammer to eliminate the issue of hammer bite, several sets of redesigned grips, new sights compatible with the FN 509 dovetail pattern, wider slide serrations, different colored PVD or stainless steel finish offerings and 17-round magazines. The new FN High Powers will be made at FN&#x27;s Columbia, South Carolina factory in the United States.

At SHOT show 2022, GİRSAN announced new color offerings for the MCP35, including two-tone and gold, as well as the MCP35 &quot;Match&quot;, which incorporated a number of designs intended to cater to target shooters, such as an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail for accessories, ergonomic grips, a shorter hammer throw, beveled and flared magwell, a flat target trigger and raised target sights with a fiber optic front sight. 

At SHOT Show in 2024, Tennessee-based company SDS Imports announced that they were reviving the John Inglis line of military-spec, parkerized Inglis Browning Hi-Power clones. SDS CEO Tim Mulverhill stated: &quot;The market demand has not been met for historically accurate Hi-Powers. We’re planning for the L9A1 to influence the Hi-Power market the way the Tisas US Army did in the 1911 market&quot;. The new Inglis Hi-Powers are available in black chromate, black Cerakote, satin nickel and color case-hardened finishes. The SDS Inglis line is essentially a more military accurate version of the now-discontinued Regent BR9, and it is a fully interchangeable Mark III design.

In August 2024, another Browning Hi-Power clone, the Centurion 14, was announced by Century Arms. The Centurion 14 is built in Turkey by Alpharms Savunma Sanayi, and imported by Century Arms.

==Design==
The Browning Hi-Power has undergone continuous refinement by FN since its introduction. The pistols were originally made in two models: an &quot;Ordinary Model&quot; with fixed sights and an &quot;Adjustable Rear Sight Model&quot; with a tangent-type rear sight and a slotted grip for attaching a wooden shoulder stock. The adjustable sights are still available on commercial versions of the Hi-Power, although the shoulder stock mounts were discontinued during World War II. In 1962, the design was modified to replace the internal extractor with an external extractor, improving reliability.

Standard Hi-Powers are based on a single-action design. Unlike modern double-action semi-automatic pistols, the Hi-Power&#x27;s trigger is not connected to the hammer. If a double-action pistol is carried with the hammer down with a round in the chamber and a loaded magazine installed, the shooter may fire the pistol either by simply squeezing the trigger or by pulling the hammer back to the cocked position and then squeezing the trigger. In contrast, a single-action pistol can only be fired with the hammer in the cocked position; this is generally done when a loaded magazine is inserted and the slide cycled by hand. In common with the M1911, the Hi-Power is therefore typically carried with the hammer cocked, a round in the chamber, and the safety catch on (a carry mode often called &quot;cocked and locked&quot; in the United States or &quot;made ready&quot; in the United Kingdom, or sometimes called &quot;condition one&quot;).

The Hi-Power, like many other Browning designs, operates on the short-recoil principle, where the barrel and slide initially recoil together until the barrel is unlocked from the slide by a cam arrangement. Unlike Browning&#x27;s earlier Colt M1911 pistol, the barrel is not moved vertically by a toggling link, but instead by a hardened bar which crosses the frame under the barrel and contacts a slot under the chamber at the rearmost part of the barrel. The barrel and slide recoil together for a short distance, but as the slot engages the bar, the chamber and the rear of the barrel are drawn downward and stopped. The downward movement of the barrel disengages it from the slide, which continues rearward, extracting the spent case from the chamber and ejecting it while also re-cocking the hammer. After the slide reaches the limit of its travel, the recoil spring brings it forward again, stripping a new round from the magazine and pushing it into the chamber. This also pushes the chamber and barrel forward. The cam slot and bar move the chamber upward and the locking lugs on the barrel re-engage those in the slide.

===Design flaws===
The pistol has a tendency to &quot;bite&quot; the web of the shooter&#x27;s hand, between the thumb and forefinger. This bite is caused by pressure from the hammer spur, or alternatively by pinching between the hammer shank and grip tang. This problem can be fixed by altering or replacing the hammer, or by learning to hold the pistol to avoid injury. While a common complaint with the commercial models with spur hammers similar to that of the Colt &quot;Government Model&quot; automatic, it is seldom a problem with the military models, which have a smaller, rounded &quot;burr&quot; hammer, more like that of the Colt &quot;Commander&quot; compact version of the 1911. Another flaw is that the original small safety is very hard to release and re-engage. This is because when cocked, the shaft the safety turns on is under hammer spring pressure. Later versions went to a larger safety to address this issue.

==Variants==
===Belgium===
The original P35, as noted earlier, featured an internal extractor. During World War II, it was manufactured by Inglis of Canada for Allied use, and by FN in occupied Belgium for German use. The P35s made under Nazi occupation were designated as the Pistole 640b. Most Canadian P35s were manufactured with a Parkerized finish, while most P35s manufactured in occupied Belgium had a blued finish. In 1962 the internal extractor was replaced with a more durable and reliable external extractor alongside other modifications, including a 2-piece barrel and modifications to the locking system for improved durability. Later barrels and frames are not interchangeable with earlier ones.

The Mark I is among the best-known models of the P35 developed over the last 50 years. P35s were first imported into the US in 1954 – the US civilian market P35s had the &#x27;Browning Arms Company&#x27; stamp on the left side of the slide (to meet the import requirement for US sales under ATF Section 478.112). These P35s lack the provision of the lanyard ring – the left side pistol grip for a Mark I is fully covered unlike those produced for military and law enforcement use. A wide variety of options and features are available on the P35 models. Recently, Hi-Power pistols have become available in .40 S&amp;W and .357 SIG loadings. The use of these calibres in guns designed and built for 9×19mm Parabellum has created cases of broken or warped frames. Only Hi-Powers specifically built for these rounds should be used to fire them. The pistols manufactured for these two rounds are easily identified by examining the left side of the slide – a groove is machined into the side of the heavier slide to allow clearance for the slide release. Genuine FN-produced P35s (either FN (Europe/international) or Browning (USA) for the civilian market will have a 245-prefix serial number. Some Hi-Power variants (Type 65, Type 73) incorporate production changes e.g. spur hammers (commonly seen for 1971–present civilian market P35s) and/or 2-piece barrels (1965–present). The &#x27;Type 73&#x27; variant (with an elongated barrel bushing) of the Mark I was produced until 1987 by FM Argentina, when the Mark II production commenced in the early-mid-1980s (Belgium).

The Mark II is an upgraded model of the original Hi-Power introduced in 1982. Some of the upgrades were ambidextrous thumb safeties, nylon grips, 3-dot low profile sights, and a throated barrel.

The Mark III was another advancement over the Mark II released in 1989, which featured a firing pin safety and a black epoxy finish. The main distinguishing (visual) feature of the Mark III is the absence of the water drain hole below the muzzle on the forward face of the slide.

** Standard is the name given to the Mark III variant with walnut grips, gloss finish, and choice of sights. A Standard is a Mark III model, but a Mark III is not necessarily a Standard.
** The Silver Chrome featured a silver-chrome frame and slide, and Pachmayr rubber grips. The magazines for the silver chrome BHP had a dull finish and a black rubber Pachmayr basepad.
** The Capitan is a Mark III variant that features adjustable tangent rear sights, a &quot;ring hammer&quot; like the early model HP35, checkered walnut grips, and a blued finish. It was reintroduced in 1993.
** The Practical is a Mark III variant featuring a slide finished in black polymer with a contrasting silver-chrome frame. In addition, this model has wraparound Pachmayr rubber grips and a &quot;ring hammer&quot;. The Practical has fixed or adjustable sights, and is available in either 9×19mm Parabellum or .40 S&amp;W. Magazines for all Practical models sport Pachmayr base pads; magazines feature a cartridge capacity of 13 rounds in 9×19mm Parabellum and a cartridge capacity of 10 rounds in .40 S&amp;W.
** The HP-SFS (Safe-Fast-Shooting) is the latest Hi-Power Mark III variant with a modified firing mechanism. After the weapon is loaded, the hammer is pushed forward, which automatically activates the safety catch. When the shooter is prepared to fire, the safety is pressed down with the thumb, releasing the hammer to spring backwards into the usual, single-action position. A similar system is available for modifying Colt M1911A1s. Magazines are interchangeable with the Mark III and others.

The BDA and BDAO models were first produced in the 1980s by FN. The BDA model is double-action, and the BDAO model is &quot;double-action only&quot;, both versions differing from the usual single-action operation of the P35. These designs have also been marketed as the FN HP-DA and Browning BDA. The DA and DAO models retain many features of the P35, and both are available in full-sized and compact versions. The performance of these models is consistent with FN&#x27;s high standards. These models resemble the P35, but the most distinguishing feature is the extended SIG Sauer-style trigger guard. Many parts are interchangeable with the P35, but the magazines (although similar) are not. The compact versions also utilise shorter magazines. 

Both the DA/DAO models and the BDM model borrow features from the SIG P220 pistols, marketed under the name Browning Double Action (BDA) in 1977.

The Beretta Cheetah has also been marketed by Browning under the name BDA 380.

===Canada===
The Pistol, Browning FN 9mm, HP No. 2 MK.1/1 Canadian Lightweight Pattern was a series of experimental aluminum/aluminum alloy framed Browning Hi-Power pistols by the Canadian Inglis Company that reduced the weight by as much as 25% from . Two scalloped cuts were made on both sides of the steel slide as well as in front of the rear sight. The reception to this was positive and so six prototype frames were machined from solid aluminum and two were sent to each of the Canadian, American, and British governments for testing. The Canadian and British governments concluded that sand and dirt caught between the steel slide and aluminum frame substantially increased wear. The steel locking block also wore the holes in its aluminum frame. 

After testing, Inglis cast 29 frames, assembled 21 pistols, and tested them, which were met with various problems. The lightweight program ended in Canada in 1951. In 1952, a US Major General Kessels requested one and took it with him in the Korean War.

The Mark I Lightweight is a very rare variant of the Mark I made with a lightweight alloy frame originally intended for paratroop use. According to Massad Ayoob, these were introduced commercially in the 1950s but never caught on. The Lightweights are marked only with Fabrique Nationale&#x27;s rollmarks, not Browning&#x27;s.

Hi-Powers made with a rear sight instead of a tangent sight with known as No. 2 while those with a tangent sight are known as No. 1

===UK===
The L9A1 was the British designation for the military version of the Hi-Power and is marked &#x27;Pistol Automatic L9A1&#x27; on the left side of the slide. It started to replace Inglis variants in British service from the late 1960s, and the two types remained in service together until the Inglis variants were finally retired in the late 1980s. The L9A1 was upgraded with the more ergonomic Mk2 ambidextrous safety and grips. 

The L9A1 was also widely used by other Commonwealth armed forces. The Hi-Power was the pistol issued to all British Armed Forces throughout the Cold War era and up to Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. 

It was phased out in 2013 and replaced with the Glock 17.

===USA===
On 18 January 2022, FN America re-introduced a new model of Hi-Power called the FN High Power. The new pistol features a 17+1 magazine capacity and various ergonomic changes to improve user handling.

===Argentina===
FM manufactures the Hi-Power under license from 1968. The license expired in 1989.

FM made a machine pistol of the FM Hi-Power known as the PB a Rafaga, which was used by Argentine special forces in anti-Montoneros opearations. The fire selector (semi or full auto) is on the right side, located above the trigger. They either use 13 or 20-round magazines.

One Rafaga was made to fire 7.63x21mm Mannlicher.

===India===
===Nigeria===
Hi-Powers were made by DICON under license.

===Indonesia===
Pindad made a licensed version of the High-Power known as the P1. Production reportedly started in the 1960s.

==Clones==
** The Rosario, FM90, and FM95 models are manufactured by FM. The Rosario is an almost exact copy of the Mark II intended for Argentine and Latin American sales. The FM90 was an export model based on the Mark II, but with a &quot;Colt style&quot; slide without the characteristic bevelled front end, first made in 1990. Rubberized pistol grips (similar to the Pachmayr grips used for P35s) with finger grooves were used in place of the traditional slab side wood grips. The FM95 was the current export model (until 2002) based on the Mark III, also with the &quot;Colt style&quot; slide. The last models, until 2010, are the M02 AR (modernised version of the M95, with a new single-action system by Fabrique nationale) and the M03 AR (not dated 2003, as it would seem, actually a .40 S&amp;W version of M02 AR) with their Detective versions.
** The Detective is a short-slide HP produced by FM. The Detective slide group was also available without the frame, and is interchangeable with other FM and FN Hi-Power P35s. The pistol and slide group have not been available for North American sales since the late 2000s, but can be found in resale outlets.

<text>In Arrernte mythology, Karora is a bandicoot ancestral deity. According to one legend, during the Dreamtime Karora lay sleeping in the earth when from his head rose a tall pole called a &quot;tnatantja&quot;. It was a living creature, its bottom resting on his head and its top reaching up into the sky. From his armpits and navel emerged bandicoots, who dug their way out of the earth just as the first sun rose into the sky. Karora followed them, seized two of the animals, then cooked and ate them. His hunger sated, he lay down to sleep again and a bullroarer emerged from under his armpit. It took on human form and grew into a young man, and when Karora woke his son danced around him. It was the very first ceremony.

Karora&#x27;s son hunted for bandicoots, which they cooked and ate, then Karora slept again and created two more sons. This continued for some time, with many more sons emerging. Eventually, all of the bandicoots Karora had created had been eaten, and the men became hungry. They hunted, but could find no game. On their way back, they heard the sound of a bullroarer, and as they searched for the source of the noise they caught sight of a sandhill wallaby. They threw their tjuringa sticks at it and broke its leg, and the sandhill wallaby called out that he was now lame and a man like them, not a bandicoot. He limped away.

The hunters continued on their way and saw Karora approaching them. He led them back to the waterhole, and as they sat at the edge of the pool a great flood of honey from the honeysuckle buds engulfed them. Karora remained at the pool, but the sons were washed away to where the sandhill wallaby man they had lamed waited for them. The place became a great &quot;djang&quot; (sacred) place, and to this day one can see the brothers grouped around the sandhill wallaby man&#x27;s body — a group of rocks positioned around a great boulder. 

Karora is said to remain at the waterhole, where he lies in eternal sleep. Those who come to drink there must carry green boughs, which they lay down on the banks before quenching their thirst.

<text>In Australian aboriginal mythology (specifically: Mandjindja), Kidili (or Kidilli) was an ancient moon-man who attempted to rape some of the first women on Earth. The Wati-kutjara wounded him in battle, castrating him with a boomerang, and he died of his wounds in a waterhole. The women he was trying to rape became the Pleiades.

<text>In Western Australian Aboriginal mythology, the Wati kutjara (also Wati kutjarra or Wadi Gudjara) are two young lizard-men (totem: goanna) who, in the Dreaming, travelled all over the Western Desert. In English, their songline is often called the &quot;Two Men Dreaming&quot;. The Wati kutjara are ubiquitous in the mythology of the Western Desert; Their journey extends for thousands of kilometres, stretching from the Kimberley to South Australia.

==Narratives==
Wati kutjara is one of the most important Dreamings around Balgo; in Kukatja narratives, the Wati kutjara are often likened to the wind, whose form they adopt when in danger. The men&#x27;s first action is to sing about their names in order to establish their own identity. Then they decide to travel about, and eventually decide to head south-east in order to enlighten the people there who do not possess the rituals known to the Dreaming heroes. As they travel, they sing of the animals, plants and geographic features that they encounter, naming them and calling them into being. Filled with magical power, these two unmarried brothers eventually travelled all over the Western Desert destroying many dangerous evil spirits. They also created sacred objects.

The Wati kutjara feature in innumerable stories, whose details vary from region to region. In one recension, they are credited with castrating the Man in the Moon by throwing a magical boomerang, Kidili, because he tried to rape the first woman. In other versions, the Wati kutjara are the ones attempting to seduce the same group of women.

==Art and literature==
*Locations and events associated with the Wati kutjara are frequently the subject of Aboriginal Art from Balgo and its outstations.
*James Cowan&#x27;s book &quot;Two men dreaming&quot; draws upon Wati kutjara narratives, although the place-names appear to have been disguised. (Note. This was done t protect the region, and the people concerned: author)

<text>Thebe , also known as , is the fourth of Jupiter&#x27;s moons by distance from the planet. It was discovered by Stephen P. Synnott in images from the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; space probe taken on March 5, 1979, while making its flyby of Jupiter. In 1983, it was officially named after the mythological nymph Thebe.

The second largest of the inner satellites of Jupiter, Thebe orbits within the outer edge of the Thebe gossamer ring that is formed from dust ejected from its surface. It is irregularly shaped and reddish in colour, and is thought like Amalthea to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and high mountains—some of them are comparable to the size of the moon itself.

Thebe was photographed in 1979 by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; spacecraft, and later, in more detail, by the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter in the 1990s.

== Discovery and observations ==

Thebe was discovered by Stephen P. Synnott in images from the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; space probe taken on March 5, 1979, and was initially given the provisional designation . In 1983 it was officially named after the mythological nymph Thebe who was a lover of Zeus—the Greek equivalent of Jupiter.

After its discovery by &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, Thebe was photographed by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; space probe in 1979. However, before the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft arrived at Jupiter, knowledge about it was extremely limited. &quot;Galileo&quot; imaged almost all of the surface of Thebe and helped clarify its composition.

== Orbit ==

Thebe is the outermost of the inner Jovian moons, and orbits Jupiter at a distance of about 222,000 km (3.11 Jupiter radii). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.018, and an inclination of 1.08° relative to the equator of Jupiter. These values are unusually high for an inner satellite and can be explained by the past influence of the innermost Galilean satellite, Io; in the past, several mean-motion resonances with Io would have passed through Thebe&#x27;s orbit as Io gradually receded from Jupiter, and these excited Thebe&#x27;s orbit.

The orbit of Thebe lies near the outer edge of the Thebe gossamer ring, which is composed of the dust ejected from the satellite. After ejection, the dust drifts in the direction of the planet under the action of Poynting–Robertson drag, forming a ring inward of the moon.

== Physical characteristics ==
Thebe is irregularly shaped, with the closest ellipsoidal approximation being 116×98×84 km. Its surface area is probably between 31,000 and 59,000 (~45,000) km2. Its bulk density and mass are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea (around 0.86 g/cm3), its mass can be estimated at 4.3 kg.

Similarly to all inner satellites of Jupiter, Thebe rotates synchronously with its orbital motion, thus keeping one face always looking toward the planet. Its orientation is such that the long axis always points to Jupiter. At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter, the surface is thought to be near the edge of the Roche limit, where Thebe&#x27;s gravity is only slightly larger than the centrifugal force. As a result, the escape velocity in these two points is very small, thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts, and ejecting it into the Thebe gossamer ring.

Zethus is the largest (diameter about 40 km) crater on and the only named surface feature of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Thebe. There are several bright spots at the rim of this crater. It is located on the far side of Thebe, facing away from Jupiter. It was discovered by the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft. It is named for Zethus (Ζῆθος), the husband of the nymph Thebe in Greek mythology.

The surface of Thebe is dark and appears to be reddish in color. There is a substantial asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavates a bright material (probably ice) from the interior of the moon. The surface of Thebe is heavily cratered and it appears that there are at least three or four large impact craters, each being roughly comparable in size to Thebe itself.

<text>In the Australian Aboriginal mythology of the Ramindjeri subgroup of the Ngarrindjeri people, Kondole was a mean and rude man. One night, the performers during a ceremony needed someone to keep a fire going; Kondole was the only one with fire, and he hid in the bush. The men argued with him, and one got frustrated and threw a spear into Kondole&#x27;s skull. All the men then turned into animals, including kangaroos, possums, fish and birds. Kondole became a whale and the hole in his head from the spear became his blowhole. The Kondole was the first whale according to Aboriginal myth. 

Ian Milne wrote the book &quot;Kondole the Whale&quot; based on this story in 1992

<text>Kunapipi, also spelt Gunabibi, (&#x27;womb&#x27;) is a mother goddess and the patron deity of many heroes in Australian Aboriginal mythology.

==Story==
Kunapipi gave birth to human beings as well as to most animals and plants. Now a vague, otiose, spiritual being, &quot;the old woman&quot; (&quot;Kadjeri&quot;) once emerged from the waters and travelled across the land with a band of heroes and heroines, and during the Dreaming she gave birth to men and women as well as creating the natural species. She could transform herself either into a male or female version of the Rainbow Serpent.

==Origins and diffusion==
The Kunapipi cult seems to have arisen among tribes in the Roper and Rose River areas. In the Alawa version, she is said to have emerged from the waters. From there, it is thought to have gradually spread north-east into Arnhem Land, where it existed as a complementary masculine form with Djanggawul, a female figure. According to Tony Swain, Kunapipi traditions, especially regarding her northern origins, reflect the impact of Sulawesi/Macassar influences, via contacts with trepang traders, and possibly the pre-Islamic rice mother cult, which survived down to modern times among the Toraja and Bugis.

<text>Douglas Richard TenNapel ( ; born July 10, 1966) is an American animator, writer, cartoonist, video game designer, and comic book artist whose work has encompassed animated television, video games, and comic books. He is best known for creating Earthworm Jim, a character that spawned a video game series, animated series, and a toy line. He is also the creator of the animated television series &quot;Catscratch&quot; (2005–2007), which aired on Nickelodeon, and was itself a loose adaptation of TenNapel&#x27;s comic book limited series &quot;Gear&quot;.

==Career==
TenNapel began as an animator on &quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: The Animated Series&quot;. He soon began working in the video game industry on projects like 1993&#x27;s &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Stimpy&#x27;s Invention&quot; for the Sega Genesis and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; for the SNES and Sega Genesis. In 1994, he created Earthworm Jim, the character that would star in Shiny Entertainment&#x27;s video game, toy line, and cartoon series. Shiny Entertainment head David Perry later commented on working with TenNapel, &quot;I wish I could find 100 Dougs, then I realized I was lucky to have been able to work with one. He is crazy talented, both crazy and talented! He also generates an enormous amount of amazing content and ideas, I wouldn’t be surprised if he sleeps with a sketch-book!&quot; In 1995, he left Shiny Entertainment and founded his own company, Neverhood, with several other former Shiny employees. Working for DreamWorks Interactive, Neverhood created &quot;The Neverhood&quot; for the PC and PlayStation. The sequel, entitled &quot;Skullmonkeys&quot;, followed in 1998.

On television, TenNapel was the creator of the &quot;Project G.e.e.K.e.R.&quot; cartoon series for CBS. He was also a consulting producer on the ABC series &quot;Push, Nevada&quot; with Ben Affleck. Towards the end of the 2000s, he also created two shorts for Frederator Studios and Nicktoons, &quot;Solomon Fix&quot; (computer generated 3D) and &quot;Squirly Town&quot; (traditional 2D).

As a graphic artist and cartoonist, TenNapel released his first comic book in 1998: &quot;Gear&quot;, a surreal epic based on his real-life cats, Simon, Waffle, Gordon and Mr. Black, in a war against dogs and insects using giant robots as weapons. The cats from &quot;Gear&quot; would eventually become the Nickelodeon series &quot;Catscratch&quot;.

TenNapel did the cover art for several of Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s albums, including a sculpture for their live album, &quot;Proof That the Youth Are Revolting&quot;. TenNapel has also created album covers and artwork for several Daniel Amos CDs, The 1999 tribute to the band, &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, the &quot;Neverhood&quot; soundtrack &quot;&quot; and others.

&quot;Flink&quot;, a graphic novel by TenNapel, was released in late 2007 through Image Comics. &quot;Monster Zoo&quot; was released in early summer 2008. In May 2009 his graphic novel &quot;Power Up&quot; was released.

Between January and October 2009, TenNapel was a regular contributor to Breitbart News&#x27; &quot;Big Hollywood&quot; section, covering topics from movie reviews and the state of the comics entertainment industry to criticisms of the Obama administration and the environmental movement.

In July 2010, his graphic novel &quot;Ghostopolis&quot; was released. In 2009, it was announced the book would be adapted into a film starring and produced by Hugh Jackman, but no update has been given since then.

TenNapel produced an episodic spoof of Japanese &quot;Super Sentai&quot;-style shows called &quot;Go Sukashi!&quot; based on a character by Shoko Nakagawa (who appears in the films), and starring John Soares and Brooke Brodack. He has also published an online superhero-genre-spoofing webcomic titled &quot;Ratfist.&quot;

In September 2012, Fox Animation optioned TenNapel&#x27;s published Graphix novel &quot;Cardboard&quot;, with plans for actor Tobey Maguire&#x27;s Material Pictures, graphic novelist Doug TenNapel, and the Gotham Group to be executive producers. Fox planned to have the picture developed under its WedgeWorks subsidiary. WedgeWorks director Chris Wedge (&quot;Ice Age&quot;) was producing, and considered directing the film as well. As of 2020, no update has been given on the film, especially given the acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets by The Walt Disney Company.

TenNapel has used Kickstarter to produce a bound collection of his sketches, named &quot;Sketchbook Archives&quot;.

TenNapel and other former members of the &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; team at Pencil Test Studios launched a Kickstarter campaign in May 2013 to fund a PC game project called &quot;Armikrog&quot;, described a spiritual successor to &quot;The Neverhood&quot; and also being animated using clay animation techniques. It was successful, and reached its stretch goal for a Wii U version.

In 2018, TenNapel self-published the graphic novel &quot;Bigfoot Bill&quot;, launched as an Indiegogo, successfully funded and reaching various stretch goals.

In May 2019, TenNapel and other members of the original &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; team announced a new &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; game, to be released as an exclusive for the upcoming Intellivision Amico. He also self-published the graphic novel &quot;Earthworm Jim: Launch the Cow&quot;, again on Indiegogo.

==Personal life==
TenNapel was born in Norwalk, California and raised in Denair, California. He has been married to Angie since 1990. The couple have four children. TenNapel was personal friends with Andrew Breitbart prior to the latter&#x27;s death.

===Criticism and controversy===

TenNapel has attracted criticism for his remarks on the LGBTQ community and its issues, including vocal opposition to same-sex marriage and intentionally misgendering a transgender journalist who criticized the &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; video game.

He has dismissed this criticism, and has written that &quot;transphobe (like homophobe) is a made-up word used to slander conservative people of faith with a mental condition, and is only used by SJWs&quot;. TenNapel was involved with Comicsgate, a right-wing campaign against diversity and progressivism in the superhero comics industry. Sean Gordon Murphy had drawn a cover for one of TenNapel&#x27;s works, &quot;Bigfoot Bill 2&quot;, which he withdrew and issued an apology after being made aware of TenNapel&#x27;s history of anti-LGBTQ comments. In response, TenNapel tweeted that it is &quot;more important than ever that pro-family comic lovers support my work&quot;, stating his belief that LGBTQ people are waging a &quot;culture war&quot; against him.

===Political views and beliefs===
TenNapel supported Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency and regularly posts his political opinions on various social media platforms.

<doc id="95234" wikidata="Q3284925" url="?curid=95234" title="Mamaragan">
<text>In Australian Aboriginal mythology (specifically: Kunwinjku), Mamaragan or Namarrkon is a lightning Ancestral Being who speaks with thunder as his voice. He rides a storm-cloud and throws lightning bolts to humans and trees. He lives in a Billabong.

==Characteristics and appearance==
Namarrkon is the lightning man. Namarrkon soaks up the sun&#x27;s rays, which form bright arcs of light across each of his shoulders. He is mostly unseen, living high in the sky and riding storm clouds. He makes thunderous sounds by striking the clouds with stone axes fixed to his head, elbows, and knees.

He appears each year in Kunumeleng, pre-monsoon season, reminding people of the consequences of invoking the spiritual power. If people disobey the law, Namarrkon hisses, crackles, and even strikes the offender with his fiery spears of lightning.

== Actions during ancient climate change ==
The climate changed nearly 7,000 years ago, causing the ice caps to melt and sea levels to rise. During this period, Namarrkon created violent thunderstorms in preparation for the Wet Season rains brought by the Rainbow Serpent.

== Dreaming site ==
During the dry season, he lives in a billabong not far from Numbuwah, a sacred rock in Western Arnhem Land. Namarrkon&#x27;s dreaming site (djadjan) is a slight projection in the outline of the Arnhem Land escarpment. It consists of three fused pillars, one with a circular hole near the top. This is a few km NE of the Nourlangie Rock tourist site to the east of Koongarra saddle. Namarggon left one eye (the hole) to watch for the monsoon, but also to watch his estranged wife, whose home is a cave in a pillar near Koongarra. Namarrkondjadjan is well-named, as the promontory creates the earliest intense lightning storms.

== In Aboriginal art ==
Namarrkon is depicted in Arnhem land Rock art with the best known depiction being at Nourlangie rock. This spirit was also depicted by numerous aboriginal artists on bark paintings including Lofty Nadjamerrek, Nadjombolmi and Mick Kubarkku. He is depicted with stone axes on his elbows or knees and a lightning surrounding his body. Only certain artists who have the right to this dreaming may paint depictions of this spirit.

==In popular culture==
In the DC Comics story &quot;The Darkseid War&quot; the superhero Shazam is empowered by six new deities; one of them is Mamaragan, revealed to be the true identity of the Wizard who originally empowered the hero.

In the Japanese Manga One Piece, Kami Eneru uses an attack called Mamaragan to attempt the destruction of Skypiea.

<text>President (also commonly called Asshole, Scum, or Capitalism) is a shedding card game for three or more, in which the players race to get rid of all of the cards in their hands in order to become &quot;president&quot; in the following round. It is a Westernized version of Chinese climbing card games such as Zheng Shangyou, Tien Len in Vietnam and the Japanese Daifugō.

President can also be played as a drinking game, and commercial versions of the game with a non-standard deck exist, including &quot;The Great Dalmuti&quot; and Presidents Card Game.

==Special titles==
There may be many titles used by players during the game. Often, players move seats to sit in the order of their place, so as not to forget the order. There is generally at least a president, vice-president and scum. However, this game is usually played with up to 6 players, and if so, more titles may be needed.

The rankings for four players are as follows:
* President – the winner of the previous round, regardless of number of players.
* Vice-president (&quot;VP&quot;) – second place, regardless of the number of players.
* Person (or other name, commonly &quot;citizen&quot; etc.) – the other players.
* High-Scum (Vice-Scum) (or other names) – next-to-last place. (For example, in a seven-person game, high-scum is whoever placed sixth.)
* Scum (or other names, commonly &quot;asshole&quot;, &quot;bum&quot;) – last place in the previous round. If the scum is last place, they get to go first to start the round.

There are other titles for games with larger numbers of player with various names.

Rules regarding card passing can be changed to accommodate these two positions if desired. A large or odd number of players generally calls for having at least one &quot;Person&quot; role, but there can be as many as needed.

The President (or the Scum in some versions) deals the cards, starting with themselves and proceeding in order of player hierarchy from low to high until all cards are dealt. If the Scum is the dealer, this ensures that the President begins with the fewest cards if the hands are uneven.

==How to play==

The rules provided are merely one of many ways known to play the game; there are many different varieties with slight twists to the rules.

===Dealing===
The person who is president (or the scum in some versions) shuffles and deals the cards. All the cards are dealt as evenly as possible in clockwise rotation.

After cards are dealt, the scum must hand over the best card in their hand to the president, and the president passes back any card they do not want.

Variations with multiple top and two bottom positions often require the scum to hand additional cards to the president, up to the number of top positions in the game. (For example, a game with a secretary and clerk might call for the scum to hand over three cards to the president, the high-scum to hand over two cards to the vice-president and the clerk to hand over one card to the secretary.) In any event, the players who receive cards from the bottom positions always hand back an equal number of &quot;junk&quot; cards that they do not want. They are not obliged to pass back their lowest cards.

===Playing===
Play in President is organized into &quot;tricks&quot;, much like in spades or bridge. However, unlike those games, each trick can involve more than one card or group of cards played by each player, and players may choose to not play in a trick. Usually, suits are irrelevant, but variants exist that include trump suits.

The player on the dealer&#x27;s left begins by leading any number of cards of the same rank (1–4; 5 or more are possible with wildcards, jokers or multiple decks). The player on the left may then play an equal number of matching cards with a higher face value, or may pass. (In a few variants, it is permitted to play cards with an equal value as the last cards played; doing so may skip the player next in order.) Note that the same number of cards as the lead must be played; e.g., if the leader starts with a pair then only pairs may be played on top of it, and if three-of-a-kind was led then only three-of-a-kinds can be played on top of it. (There are notable exceptions among the many variants in this game.) The next player may do the same, and so on.

This continues until all players have had a turn (which may or may not be because the highest-value card has already been played), or opted to pass.

===End of a round===
When one player runs out of cards, they have won and are out of play for the rest of the round, but the other players might continue to play to determine the remaining titles (position). A few versions hold that once a player goes out, players count remaining card values to establish titles, or simply count the number of cards remaining in each player&#x27;s hand, and other versions have one player left with cards at the end.

When playing by traditional rules, once titles are decided, most players stands and moves position to accommodate the winner&#x27;s seated position. The President is the dealer (or the Scum in some versions), and the players must rearrange themselves around them so that they are seated in order of rank, clockwise. Some variants do not rearrange the seating of the players, so everyone plays in the same order each hand (though the president still leads the first trick).

After the first round has determined player rank, subsequent hands are opened by the president.

===President&#x27;s choice and trading===
In some variations of the game, after the president (or whoever deals) has dealt and everyone has received their hands, the players must trade cards with one another, based on positions. In a group of four, the president gives two cards of their choice to scum (who responds with the two very best cards from their hand), and the vice-president gives one card of their choosing to vice-scum, who responds with their very best card. In some variants, the president may choose to allow a black market, in which any player can trade with any other player. When this happens, the President usually has a poor hand and needs better cards. The president may also allow table talk, which is when two given players (usually of adjacent ranks) let each other see each other&#x27;s hands.
If there are no image cards on the hands of the (scum) there will be a new &#x27;dealing&#x27;

===Notes on game play===
* The ordering of the face values is a little different from most American and English card games – the 2 is the highest value (besides the joker, if that card is used) and is unbeatable, though certain variants allow a single 2 to be topped by a pair of 2s. The Ace is next highest, then King, etc., with the 3 being the lowest. A few variants allow a single deuce to be played on top of any other combination, but typically games require the same number of 2s to be played as were originally led. In a few variants, the 2 (and no other card) can be placed at any time, even if it is not the player&#x27;s turn. On the US West Coast and in Hawaii, Aces are high and 2 is the lowest card.
* It may be played as an Aces-high game, although 2s are wild and the red 3 is highest, and 2s cannot beat red 3s. The black 3s are the lowest cards, and 2s can be played as black 3s. The player goes first if they have a 3 of spades in the first round. Double 2s are not needed to clear doubles.
* Players can pass at any time, even if the player has cards that could be played. Passing might or might not not prevent a player from playing a card the next time around, depending on the variant.
* The number of cards that can be led to begin any trick is only dependent on the cards in the player&#x27;s hand and their strategy. In a game with two decks, it is absolutely legal to start out a trick with, say, seven 5s. (In this case, obviously, seven 5s are only possible if the owner of those seven 5s is the one who begins the trick. This adds to the necessity to &quot;capture&quot; tricks by being the one to play the highest card.)
* A bomb is a card that is used to clear the trick. Frequently, these are twos. Players can only play a bomb on their turn.
* Players can never lead with a two or bomb.
* If a player plays a card, and no other player can play, that card is discarded and the player puts another card to begin with. This continues until it returns to the player who played the last card: if they are unable to play on their own card, they must discard the cards and start with another card of their choice.
* Players can continue playing even after all other players have passed until the last player decides to stop playing.

==Further Variations==
In one variation, the trades between higher players and lower players are reversed. The president trades their two best cards to the scum, and the scum gives their two worst cards to the president, and the same goes with the vice president and scum. This variation is comedically known as &quot;Communism&quot; or &quot;Socialism.&quot;

Some play that the holder of the lowest card of a particular suit (e.g. ) leads the first deal. Others play that the scum always starts.

Certain variants allow for game-changing revolutions. If a player leads out with four of a kind, the hierarchy of all the cards will be reversed. For example, if is the typical order of power (from left to right), after four of a kind is played it would be the reverse of that: . If another four of a kind is played, the order would switch back. Revolutions are typically utilized in the game to create better balance and avoid having the same player remain in first position forever.

In some variants, there are certain cards that are able to be played over a 2, those being the two &quot;One-Eyed&quot; Jacks (The Jack of Spades and the Jack of Hearts) and the &quot;Suicide King&quot; (the King of Hearts), the latter of which also ranks above the former. This is often also played in conjunction with the stipulation that one fewer of a bomb card is required to be played over a trick of pairs or triples. For example, if a player plays 4 aces, it can be beaten with three 2s, both One-Eyed Jacks, or the King of Hearts. This creates a rare but interesting scenario where if all four 2s are played at once, it is unbeatable as trumping it would require 3 One-Eyed Jacks or two Suicide Kings, which is impossible if playing with only one deck.

In some variants, a player cannot end on a 2 or a joker (or any card that instantly clears the deck), otherwise they immediately become scum/super scum, regardless of who actually got rid of their cards last. (For example, in game, Bob and Alice are the only people left. Bob has an ace and a 2 in his hand. He plays the ace, which Alice cannot play on. That card is discarded, however, Bob has ended on a 2, which means he immediately becomes scum/super scum, and Alice does not fall to the lowest rank.)

In variants that include &quot;quick-clears&quot;, a player can complete the cards on the table by playing the remaining cards of the quadruple. This is valid even if the last card played of the quadruple before the clear was a face-down or face-up card the previous player &quot;attempted&quot; to play in a commonly accepted charade wherein that player shows the card before picking it up along with the pile. In this type of clear, timing is key and successfully pulling it off reveals the true skill of the clearing player.

Another variant requires the President to give their lowest cards to the scum, even if this &quot;breaks up&quot; a good combination in their starting deal.

Other variations include &quot;straights&quot; or &quot;runs&quot;. Similar to a poker straight, but a player may play a minimum of a 3 card straight (e.g ). The hand can only be beaten by a 3 card straight ending in higher card (e.g ). The round is determined by the length of the straight. Longer straights/runs are achievable but may reduce a players doubles, triples or quads, in doing so.

A variation of the game, Big Two (also known as Deuces), uses the card-passing roles from the game of President.

<text>In the Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology of the Ngarrindjeri people, Mar&#x27;rallang was the name shared by twin sisters who lived together. They both married the same man.

Having heard of a young hunter by the name of Waiyungari, both Mar&#x27;rallang and her twin (also Mar&#x27;rallang) set out to meet him. While he is hunting game, the eldest of the sisters is hides in a bush and imitates the cry of a female emu. Attracted by the noise, the hunter discovers her laughing at him. A few days later, the younger sister plays the same trick. Falling under the charm of the two sisters, the hunter marries them against his uncle&#x27;s advice. The uncle, upset, seeks advice from Nebalee, a wise man of heaven and brother of the Great Spirit. He is given the advice to separate his nephew from the two women.

To separate them, the man chooses to use the fire. One night, taking advantage of their sleep, he sets fire to their encampment. Awakened by noise and smoke, the young hunter and his wives quickly find themselves encircled and trapped by the flames. Seeing no escape, the hunter confides his spear to his wives and asks Nebalee to save the two Mar&#x27;rallang, making fun of his own fate. Nebalee replies by raising his spear (on which Mar&#x27;rallang and Mar&#x27;rallang were standing) towards the sky. The husband sees his wives disappear, but before he sinks into unconsciousness because of the smoke, he hears a voice say to him &quot;take your place among the stars to remind people to think of others before thinking about oneself&quot;.

It is not known which stars the narrative is attached to, but the hunter hero is associated with Mars.

<text>In Aboriginal mythology, Minawara and Multultu were the legendary ancestors of the Nambutji tribe. They were a kangaroo that appear to have an human body, beside the body of human the rest are still kangaroo body part. They are part of a tribe that lives peacefully in their village, but until the Deities give their tribe a divine punishment because someone violated a sacred oath in the village. It causes the Deities fulled by anger and sent the Great Flood to sweep away their village. Minawara and Multultu were tossed here and there, carried by the waves that slaughterer their entire families, their memories and the place where they grew up. To the point where it finally stopped. They stopped with a pile of debris carried away by the Great Flood. They begin their long journey into the void, without direction or any kind of clues of where they should go or do. They been walking nonstop, no food neither drink, just them and their unbreakable determination to keep going. Along the way, they little by little lose their worldliness. Their noses are damaged because they are blocked too much by sand or anything else on their way. Their eyes no longer able to see anymore, because they don&#x27;t even blink to stay awake, because they don&#x27;t know when disaster will strike again. Their lungs and all their internal organs were destroyed. their bones are as hard as stone, their skin is as rough as trees that are thousands of years old, and various other things. However, none of the obstacles that occurred stopped them from continuing to move forward.

Reaching a point where determination alone could no longer sustain their lives, they continued their journey with unwavering resolve. However, they could not deceive their own bodies. Minawara and Multultu were unaware that their end was truly near, as their bodies had reached their limits. Minawara, as the elder sibling with a more mature and wise nature, sensed an instinct: that it was time to cease their aimless wandering. Minawara felt that this instinct should not be ignored. Finally, Minara stopped walking, embraced Multultu tightly, and took her last breath, officially ending their journey into the void. Until, Dream Time An era(?), an entity(?) that defies explanation and understanding by thought, the only way to describe it is by saying that Dream Time is the foundation of all Aboriginal mythology, as &quot;something&quot; that serves as a vessel for the madness contained within it. Minawara and Multultu suddenly found themselves in an empty place, with nothing around them—only them and a formless entity in front of them. The entity introduced itself as &quot;Dreamtime&quot; and offered them a choice: to end their journey here or to begin a new life as a new, better, wiser, and stronger Minawara and Multultu.

Minawara and Multultu chose to start a new life, asking for the strength to become more powerful so they could protect each other. Dreamtime acknowledged them and granted them power, not because they asked for it, but because they deserved it. Minawara was given the ability to alter fate, while Multultu was granted the power to manipulate time at will. Their powers were like Yin and Yang from Chinese mythology. With Minawara&#x27;s cleverness, Minawara created a unique power by altering it own fate. Minawara developed a force that allowed itself to unite with Multultu, becoming a single entity so profound that even Dreamtime was shaken by its presence. Eventually, they were appointed as the guardians of Dreamtime. When they merged, they were known as Minultu. Minultu is an entity that transcends thought, something that cannot be explained by logic. Minultu is depicted as a kangaroo with a human body, possessing wings that are black and white; although some also describe them as red and blue. Minultu is portrayed as wise, decisive, and responsible. Bearing the role of guardian with the power to overturn the order of the world, Minawara and Multultu stand on the side of good. With the titles: the Guardian of Dream Time and the Guide to the Dream Time.

<text>In Australian Aboriginal mythology (specifically: Yolngu), Mokoi (lit. &quot;evil spirit&quot;) is an evil spirit who killed sorcerers who used black magic. Also known to kidnap children at night to eat them. The Murngin believed that death was rarely caused by old age and instead it was the work of a mokoi, who would bring about some sort of disease or fatal accident.
The legend say he gave his life for the devil. He’s in his debt and he’s helping him. His main task is to kill magicians who take pleasure in black magic. He does this because the magicians take a pact and it leads to death.
He eats the children to extract their elixir of life. He needs the elixir to strengthen himself, which is paradoxical because he’s dead. Another thesis is, that he kills the children to lure the parents into the woods to inflict them harm.

<doc id="95250" wikidata="Q2347178" url="?curid=95250" title="Development of the human body">
<text>Development of the human body is the process of growth to maturity. The process begins with fertilization, where an egg released from the ovary of a female is penetrated by a sperm cell from a male. The resulting zygote develops through mitosis and cell differentiation, and the resulting embryo then implants in the uterus, where the embryo continues development through a fetal stage until birth. Further growth and development continues after birth, and includes both physical and psychological development that is influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and other factors. This continues throughout life: through childhood and adolescence into adulthood.

==Before birth==

Development before birth, or prenatal development () is the process in which a zygote, and later an embryo, and then a fetus develops during gestation. Prenatal development starts with fertilization and the formation of the zygote, the first stage in embryonic development which continues in fetal development until birth.

===Fertilization===
Fertilization occurs when the sperm successfully enters the ovum&#x27;s membrane. The chromosomes of the sperm are passed into the egg to form a unique genome. The egg becomes a zygote and the germinal stage of embryonic development begins. The germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization, through the development of the early embryo, up until implantation. The germinal stage is over at about 10 days of gestation.

The zygote contains a full complement of genetic material with all the biological characteristics of a single human being, and develops into the embryo. Embryonic development has four stages: the morula stage, the blastula stage, the gastrula stage, and the neurula stage. Prior to implantation, the embryo remains in a protein shell, the zona pellucida, and undergoes a series of rapid mitotic cell divisions called cleavage. A week after fertilization the embryo still has not grown in size, but hatches from the zona pellucida and adheres to the lining of the mother&#x27;s uterus. This induces a decidual reaction, wherein the uterine cells proliferate and surround the embryo thus causing it to become embedded within the uterine tissue. The embryo, meanwhile, proliferates and develops both into embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue, the latter forming the fetal membranes and the placenta. In humans, the embryo is referred to as a fetus in the later stages of prenatal development. The transition from embryo to fetus is arbitrarily defined as occurring 8 weeks after fertilization. In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a set of progressively developing internal organs. A nearly identical process occurs in other species.

===Embryonic development===

Human embryonic development refers to the development and formation of the human embryo. It is characterised by the process of cell division and cellular differentiation of the embryo that occurs during the early stages of development. In biological terms, human development entails growth from a one-celled zygote to an adult human being. Fertilization occurs when the sperm cell successfully enters and fuses with an egg cell (ovum). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of prenatal development commences. The embryonic stage covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a fetus.

The germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until implantation is completed in the uterus. The germinal stage takes around 10 days. During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called cleavage. A blastocyst is then formed and implanted in the uterus. Embryonic development continues with the next stage of gastrulation, when the three germ layers of the embryo form in a process called histogenesis, and the processes of neurulation and organogenesis follow.

In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryonic development involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in gene expression, cell growth and cellular differentiation. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among chordates.

===Fetal development===

A fetus is a stage in the human development considered to begin nine weeks after fertilization. In biological terms, however, prenatal development is a continuum, with many defining features distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. A fetus is also characterized by the presence of all the major body organs, though they will not yet be fully developed and functional and some not yet situated in their final location.
===Maternal influences===

The fetus and embryo develop within the uterus, an organ that sits within the pelvis of the mother. The process the mother experiences whilst carrying the fetus or embryo is referred to as pregnancy. The placenta connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake, thermo-regulation, waste elimination, and gas exchange via the mother&#x27;s blood supply; to fight against internal infection; and to produce hormones which support pregnancy. The placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to growing fetuses and removes waste products from the fetus&#x27; blood. The placenta attaches to the wall of the uterus, and the fetus&#x27; umbilical cord develops from the placenta. These organs connect the mother and the fetus. Placentas are a defining characteristic of placental mammals, but are also found in marsupials and some non-mammals with varying levels of development. The homology of such structures in various viviparous organisms is debatable, and in invertebrates such as Arthropoda, is analogous at best.

==After birth==
===Infancy and childhood===

Childhood is the age span ranging from birth to adolescence. In developmental psychology, childhood is divided up into the developmental stages of toddlerhood (learning to walk), early childhood (play age), middle childhood (school age), and adolescence (puberty through post-puberty). Various childhood factors could affect a person&#x27;s attitude formation.

*Prepubescence 
** Neonate (newborn) 
**Infant (baby) 
**Toddler 
**Play age 
**Elementary school age, may coincide with preadolescence (preteen)
The Tanner stages can be used to approximately judge a child&#x27;s age based on physical development.

===Puberty===

Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child&#x27;s body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testicles in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growth—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs.

On average, girls begin puberty around ages 10–11 and end puberty around 15–17; boys begin around ages 11–12 and end around 16–17. The major landmark of puberty for females is menarche, the onset of menstruation, which occurs on average between ages 12 and 13; for males, it is the first ejaculation, which occurs on average at age 13. In the 21st century, the average age at which children, especially girls, reach puberty is lower compared to the 19th century, when it was 15 for girls and 16 for boys. This can be due to any number of factors, including improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth, increased weight and fat deposition, or exposure to endocrine disruptors such as xenoestrogens, which can at times be due to food consumption or other environmental factors. Puberty which starts earlier than usual is known as precocious puberty, and puberty which starts later than usual is known as delayed puberty.

Notable among the morphologic changes in size, shape, composition, and functioning of the pubertal body, is the development of secondary sex characteristics, the &quot;filling in&quot; of the child&#x27;s body; from girl to woman, from boy to man.

===Adulthood===
Biologically, an adult is a human or other organism that has reached sexual maturity. In human context, the term adult has additional meanings associated with social and legal concepts. In contrast to a legal minor, a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient, and responsible. The typical age of legal majority is 18 years in most contexts, although the definition of majority may vary by legal rights and country.

Human adulthood encompasses psychological adult development. Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; an adolescent may be biologically an adult and display adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely, a legal adult may possess none of the maturity and responsibility that is supposed to define them; the mental and physical development and maturity of an individual has been proven to be greatly influenced by their life circumstances.

==Organ systems==
Human organs and organ systems develop in a process known as organogenesis. This begins in the third week of embryonic development, when the gastrula forms three distinct germ layers, the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. The ectoderm will eventually develop into the outer layer of skin and nervous system. The mesoderm will form skeletal muscles, blood cells, the reproductive system, the urinary system, most of the circulatory system, and the connective tissue of the torso. The endoderm will develop into the epithelium of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and several glands.

== Linear growth ==
During childhood, the bones undergo a complex process of elongation that occurs in a specific area called the epiphyseal growth plates (EGP). This process is regulated by various hormones and factors, including the growth hormone, vitamin D, and others. These hormones promote the production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which plays a key role in the formation of new bone cells. Adequate nutrient intake is essential for the production of these hormones, which are critical for proper bone growth. However, a lack of proper nutrition can hinder this process and result in stunted growth.

Linear growth takes place in the epiphyseal growth plates (EGP) of long bones. In the growth plate, chondrocytes proliferate, hypertrophy and secrete cartilage extracellular matrix. New cartilage is subsequently remodeled into bone tissue, causing bones to grow longer. Linear growth is a complex process regulated by the growth hormone (GH) – insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis, the thyroxine/triiodothyronine axis, androgens, estrogens, vitamin D, glucocorticoids and possibly leptin. GH is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland in response to hypothalamic, pituitary and circulating factors. It affects growth by binding to receptors in the EGP, and inducing production and release of IGF-1 by the liver. IGF-1 has six binding proteins (IGFBPs), exhibiting different effects on body tissues, where IGFBP-3 is most abundant in human circulation. IGF-1 initiates growth through differentiation and maturation of osteoblasts, and regulates release of GH from the pituitary through feedback mechanisms. The GH/IGF-1 axis is responsive to dietary intake and infections. The endocrine system seems to allow for rapid growth only when the organism is able to consume sufficient amounts of nutrients and signaling from key nutrients such as amino acids and zinc to induce production of IGF-1 is present. At the same time inflammation and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines may cause GH resistance and a decrease in circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 which in turn reduces endochondrial ossification and growth. However, the EGP appears to conserve much growth capacity to allow for catch-up growth. Concerns have been raised about associations between catch-up growth and increased risk of non-communicable diseases in adulthood. In a large study based on 5 birth cohorts in Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines and South Africa, faster linear growth at 0–2 years was associated with improvements in adult stature and school performance, but also an increased likelihood of overweight (mainly related to lean mass) and a slightly elevated blood pressure in young adulthood.

<text>In Binbinga mythology, Ulanji is a snake-ancestor of the Binbinga. He bit the heads off some flying foxes and took out two of their ribs and their heart. Ulanji emerged from the ground at a place called Markumundana. He walked along to a large hill, Windilumba, where he made a spring, and also a mountain close by. He crossed what is now known as the Limmen Creek, and made a range of hills and a valley, with a large number of water-holes and plenty of lilies in them. He left behind numbers of Ulanji spirits, which emanated from his body, wherever he performed ceremonies. After travelling over a great extent of country, and making many &quot;mungai&quot; (totem animal) spots, he finally went into the ground at a water-hole called Uminiwura.

The Binbinga believe that both men and women can see the spirit children at the mungai spots.

<text>In the mythology of the Wunambal people of northwestern Australia, Ungud is a snake god who is sometimes male, sometimes female and sometimes androgynous. He is associated with rainbows by the fact Ungud may be a symbolic representation of rainbows and the fertility and erections of the tribe&#x27;s shamans. In the beginning, when only the sky and the earth existed, Ungud lived underground as a giant python. Ungud is associated with earth and water and is credited with causing rain to fall and also has connections with monsoons. At night, Ungud and Wallanganda, the sky deity (associated with the Milky Way), created living beings through their dreams. The Mother Goddess Kunapipi who is also at times is called the Old Woman is connected to Ungud. The Rainbow Serpent made paths for her to walk around creation. Both The mother goddess and Rainbow serpent are the embodiment of creative powers that live within the earth. Through Ungud Dreaming itself into new forms natural species making it part of what life is based on becoming an archetype of life.

<text>The Wawalag sisters, also written as Wauwaluk Wawilak Waggilak, Wagilag, or Wawalik, are ancestral creator beings whose story is part of widespread sacred rituals in the Aboriginal culture from Arnhem land, Northern Territory, Australia.

The story takes place in Dreamtime, a period of time in Aboriginal belief where ancestral beings created the land as well as the social and linguistic structures in it. The sisters are said to have helped draw linguistic and social differences amongst the clans in Arnhem Land, but the ceremonies associated with their stories create cultural unity.

According to the story, the sisters were travelling to the Arafura Sea, but had to stop as the elder sister was about to have a baby and needed to rest. Later on, the elder sister goes in the river to bathe with her child and the smell of afterbirth blood awakens Yulunggur, the Rainbow Serpent, who then comes out of its waterhole and swallows both sisters and the baby.

An understanding of a common narrative was developed through field-research by archaeologists such as Catherine Berndt, Lloyd Warner, and Ronald Berndt during the mid-1990s. Since then there has been an increase in the representation of the story through Aboriginal artwork that attempts to show the complexity of the story, and how it cannot be limited to the western idea of chronological storytelling.
== Narrative ==
The story of the Wawalag (Wauwaluk, Wawilak, Waggilak, Wagilag, Wawalik) sisters takes place in Dreamtime, a period of time in Aboriginal belief where ancestral beings created the land as well as the social and linguistic structures in it. The sisters are said to have helped draw linguistic and social differences amongst the clans in Arnhem Land, but the ceremonies associated with their stories create cultural unity. The story varies across the different linguistic regions in Arnhem land, but they all share a similar pattern that explains the origins of the Djungguwan, Gunabibi and Ulmark rituals, three sacred ceremonies associated with fertility, marriage and age-grading. During these ceremonies each clan reveals more details about their version of the story through songs, dances and paintings; but access to these rituals is usually limited to initiated Dua males only.

An understanding of a common narrative was developed through field-research by archaeologists such as Catherine Berndt, Lloyd Warner and Ronald Berndt during the mid-1990s.

The myth tends to be told as a group of related events rather than a continuous narrative that follows a linear structure.

===The storyline===
It is said that the sisters were travelling from the south of Arnhem Land to the Arafura Sea, walking only through territory of Dua moiety. They gathered plants and animals along the way to prepare and eat later. They stop to rest and set camp near the Mirrirmina waterhole where the elder sister gives birth. While the younger sister prepared a fire to cook the food they had gathered, the elder sister takes the baby near the water to bathe him. Some of the residual afterbirth blood goes in the waterhole where Yurlunggur, the rainbow serpent, resides and attracts its attention. The food the younger sister was preparing comes back to life and crawls away from the fire and into the waterhole. The serpent removes a rock that was lying at the bottom of the well and throws it onto the land, the well starts filling up with more water and the land begins to flood. A dark cloud forms on top of where the sisters had set camp and a thunderstorm begins. Unaware that it was the snake causing the thunderstorm and the flooding, they build a hut to protect themselves.

When the sisters see Yurlunggur crawl out of its waterhole, they start singing the sacred songs, which are now part of the Djungguan, Ulmark, and Gunabibi ceremonies, in an attempt to keep the snake away. They continue to sing and dance, taking turns until the storm appears to ease, exhausted the sister seek refuge in the hut where they fall asleep. The serpent enters the hut and swallows both sisters and the baby, then it rises up to the sky and proceeds to finish singing the songs the sister were singing.

After swallowing the sisters and the baby, Yurlunggur and other totemic snakes gather together to tell one another what they had eaten. The snakes realise that they were not speaking the same dialect but despite this they could still communicate using the sacred songs. At first, Yulunggur tries to hide that he/she had eaten the sisters and their baby but he/she, feeling unwell, admits the truth and regurgitates them. The serpent swallows and regurgitates them again, and the third time he/she swallows them and takes them back to Wawilak country where he spits out the two sisters which then turn to stone

=== Regional variations ===
Each clan of Dua moiety has its own version of the story as the songs, dances and painting used to tell the story changes according to the relationship the ancestral beings had with the clan&#x27;s land. The most common differences amongst the various interpretations are the places in which the sisters camped and the combination of plants and animals they gathered along the way. This is determined by the geographical location of a clan, as these details are often changed to make it more relatable to their context by using the animals and territory they are familiar with. The group of events that each clan has access to or ownership of also varies, meaning that the more clans a person is affiliated to, the more knowledge about the story they will have. People affiliated to the Marrakulu clan country, for example, have knowledge that focuses on the journey of the sisters from Nilitji to Guaka&#x27;wuy, where it is said that they encounter the first ancestral people of Australia, also known as Djuwany people.

== Characteristics and associations ==
The sisters were from Ngukurr and they were part of the Wawalak clan which belongs to the Dua moiety, one of the many  Australian Aboriginal kinship groups of the Yolngu people. Most commonly, the elder sister, &quot;Waimariwi&quot;, is pregnant while the younger one, &quot;Boaliri&quot;, is going through early puberty. In other versions, the younger sister is pregnant while the elder sister already has a baby that is around two to three years old. It is unclear what gender the baby is as it is addressed as both male and female. They were creation beings who travelled through Arnhem Land performing song and dance cycles that revealed, for the first time, the names of the places they were walking through and the plants and animals they gathered along the way. Because of this, they are associated with the development of moieties and language in Arnhem Land.

=== Moieties ===

The myth is closely associated with the importance of moieties and the avoidance practices that go along with them. In Arnhem Land, the Yolngu clans are divided into two moieties, Dua, also known as Dhuwa, and Yirritja. According to the story, the sisters only travel through Dua territory, meaning that everything they encountered also share the same moiety. In some versions of the story, there is a strong focus on the pregnancy being a result of an incestuous relationship between the elder sister and a Dua clansmen; while they may not be directly related, they share the same moiety, which is why the act is frowned upon. When the baby is born, the sisters encounter for the first time something that does not belong to the Dhua moiety, as children take the opposite moiety from their mother&#x27;s, making the baby Yirritja.

Similarly, the Rainbow Serpent swallowing the sisters is also seen as an act of incest, as the serpent is also of Dua moiety. While it is unclear if Yulunggur, the serpent, is male or female because it is often referred to as both, the encounter between he/she and the sisters is often interpreted as a symbolism of sex.

=== Language ===
The story is also associated with the origin of linguistic differences in Arnhem Land. During their journey, the sisters were singing and naming the different plants and animals they were gathering as well as the territories they were passing through. They do this by using a range of dialects including Djaun, Rainbarngo, Djimba, Wawilak, and Liaalaomir. The emergence of linguistic differences is mainly addressed at the end of the story, when Yulunggur gathers with the other totemic serpents and realises that they speak different dialects.

== Role in traditional culture ==
===Rituals and ceremonies===
The story of these ancestral beings forms the basis of sacred rituals that are widespread across Arnhem Land. The story of the sisters embody what the clans consider their religious law and it is traditionally told through paintings, sculptures, song and dance cycles. These sacred laws, also referred to as &quot;madayin&quot;, are specific to each clan and they are taught during three ceremonies. Because of the sacred nature of these rituals, there is a restricted access to them and a limited understanding of the knowledge shared during them.

Djungguwan is considered the initiation ritual when young boys from the Dua moiety are circumcised and introduced to the cultural laws of their clan through the story of the sisters. In the narrative, the gender of the babies is ambiguous, sometimes they are referred to as sons or daughters, because they are yet to be circumcised. The removal of the foreskin marks the separation of what is considered the &#x27;female part of male infants&#x27; Dua men and women come together to perform dance and song cycles which represent the snake awakening when it smelled the blood and exited the waterhole to make its way to the sisters’ hut. In 1966 footage of the ceremony was captured, parts of the ritual were not shown as they are only accessible for  those taking part in the ritual or initiated Dua men.

Gunabibi is a fertility ritual that is done during dry season; the song and dance cycles focus on recreating the part of the story where the land was flooding because of the rain. The transition from dry season to wet is often seen as a symbol of fertility in the story, making this the main focus of this ritual. For weeks, both men and women perform together non-sacred songs until the bullroarer is turned, representing the voice of Yurlunggur.

Ulmark ceremony, also known as Ngurlmak, is the final ceremony and while it involves other myths, it &quot;re-emphasizes the fertility elements and the bisexual symbolism already present in the first two&quot; ceremonies.

These rituals belong to the Dhua moiety which means that the clans affiliated to it are the owners and custodians of the knowledge shared during them. However, clans of the Yirritja moiety are involved during some parts of these rituals

=== Totems and paintings ===
During these rituals, wooden sculptures and bark paintings are used as mnemonic devices to tell parts of the story and or represent the sisters. Some of these objects are considered sacred and can only be accessed and made by a select group of men. What limits how public the display of these objects can be is the ceremonial context not the design itself. The process behind making the wood-cravings is lengthy, a lot of detail goes into the totemic painting as the specific pattern and colours used is what symbolises the connection with the ancestral being. These painted designs can be used and adapted to other media, such as bark painting, sand sculpture, body painting, etc. Because the story varies among clans depending on their geographical origin, the design used also changes to fit their interpretation.

=== Sacred sites ===
Some of the locations mentioned in the story are considered ceremonial grounds while others have become sacred sites that cannot be visited. For example, the Mirrimina waterhole, which is where the sisters last camped before being swallowed by the serpent, can only be visited by elder clansmen. The Liaalaomir, Gunabibi and Ulmark dancing grounds, which according to the story were made by the impact of Yurlunggur falling sick to the ground after swallowing the sisters and their babies, are considered sacred territory where ceremonies are held.

== Modern art and representation ==
Since the late 1990s there has been a shift in the way knowledge about the story is shared, making it more accessible to people outside of the Indigenous community from Arnhem Land, creating a better understanding of Aboriginal culture. There are still strong restrictions as to what type of knowledge can be shared, and the design and patterns used in the artistic representation of the story require pre-existing knowledge of the context to be fully understood; this helps maintain certain aspects private. Artists will often accompany their work with a brief description of the story but will avoid going into detail to respect the parts of the story that are considered sacred. 

The exhibition &quot;The Painters of the Wagilag Sisters story 1937-1997&quot; was an exhibition of the work of more than 100 Aboriginal artists held at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. It was curated by Nigel Lendon and Tim Bonyhady. Artists represented in the exhibition included:
*Mawalan Marika, prominent artist and senior member of the Rirratjingu clan, who was also custodian of Djang&#x27;kawu stories and ceremonies
*Ramingining artist Philip Gudthaykudthay (aka &quot;Pussycat&quot;)

<doc id="95259" wikidata="Q366317" url="?curid=95259" title="Luis A. Ferré">
<text>Don Luis Alberto Ferré Aguayo (February 17, 1904 October 21, 2003) was a Puerto Rican engineer, industrialist, politician, philanthropist, and a patron of the arts. He was the governor of Puerto Rico from 1969 to 1973. He was the founder of the New Progressive Party, which advocates for Puerto Rico to become a state of the United States of America. He is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life==
Luis Alberto Ferré Aguayo was born in the southern city of Ponce, Puerto Rico on February 17, 1904. Ferré&#x27;s grandfather Maurice Ferré Perotín was a French engineer who was involved in the construction of the Panama Canal before settling in Cuba. Ferré&#x27;s father, Antonio Ferré Bagayado or &quot;Bacallao&quot;, was born in Havana, Cuba and grew up there. As a young man he immigrated to Puerto Rico, where he founded the company Puerto Rico Iron Works, in Barrio Playa de Ponce, Ponce, Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, Antonio Ferré met and married María Aguayo Casals, a cousin of both Catalan cellist Pablo Casals (whose mother was a Puerto Rico-born Catalan musician) and Carmelita Defilló Sanz (wife to Dominican politician and historian Manuel Arturo Peña Batlle and mother of Dominican paintist Fernando Peña Defilló). Antonio and María had four sons, Luis, José, Carlos and Hermán Ferré, and two daughters, Rosario and Isolina, this latter would become a nun of international prominence.

Ferré studied mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, obtaining his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1924 and master&#x27;s degree in 1925, and music at the New England Conservatory of Music. During this time while living in Boston, Ferré developed an admiration for the &quot;American way of democracy&quot;.

==Industrialist==
Upon his return to Puerto Rico, Ferré helped transform his father&#x27;s company into a successful business from which he earned a fortune. In 1948, he acquired &quot;El Día,&quot; a fledgling newspaper that was later renamed &quot;El Nuevo Día,&quot; becoming the newspaper with the largest circulation in Puerto Rico at the time. In the 1950s, Ferré&#x27;s &quot;Empresas Ferré&quot; (Ferre Enterprises) acquired Puerto Rico Cement and Ponce Cement, which capitalized on the economic boom which Puerto Rico enjoyed based on the ambitious industrialization projects undertaken in association with the Operation Bootstrap. Ferré&#x27;s brother, José, had moved to Miami with his family. His son Maurice expanded a successful business there, selling bagged pre-mixed cement and sand under the name Mezcla Lista. Maurice Ferré was elected Mayor of Miami.

==Political life==
Ferré became active in politics in the 1940s. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Ponce in 1940 and Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico in 1948.

===Representative===
In 1948, Puerto Ricans were allowed to elect their governor; previously the position was filled by appointment by the United States president. Luis Muñoz Marín was elected governor of Puerto Rico. A movement began which aimed to adopt a commonwealth relationship with the United States of America. In 1951, a referendum was held to decide whether to approve or not the option granted by the United States Congress to draft Puerto Rico&#x27;s first constitution. Ferré abstained from participating in the process; the pro-statehood party to which he belonged favored the 1951 referendum. He believed that the process would mean &quot;an acceptance of a colony and condemn the people to a perpetual condition of second class citizenship&quot;. Ferré later participated in the constitutional assembly created by the referendum, which drafted the constitution.

In 1952 the Constitution of Puerto Rico was adopted, renaming the body politic of the territory of Puerto Rico as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Ferré was elected as a member of the Constitutional Assembly. That same year Ferré was elected representative in the Puerto Rico House of Representatives. He ran under the Republican Statehood Party (&quot;Partido Estadista Republicano) and officially assumed his duties as representative on January 11, 1953.
===Governor and Senator===
On July 23, 1967, a plebiscite was held to decide if the people of Puerto Rico desired to become an independent nation, a state of the United States of America, or continue the commonwealth relation established in 1952. The majority of Puerto Ricans opted for the Commonwealth option (see Puerto Rican status referendums). Disagreement within the then pro-statehood party headed by Miguel A. García Méndez led Ferré and others to found the New Progressive Party (a.k.a., PNP).

In the following general election in 1968, Ferré ran for Governor and defeated Luis Negrón López, the candidate of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) by a slight margin. The ruling party had split with the creation of the People&#x27;s Party, which ran incumbent PDP-elected Governor Roberto Sánchez Vilella as its gubernatorial candidate, ending Luis Muñoz Marín&#x27;s PPD&#x27;s hold on the governor&#x27;s seat, which had lasted 20 years.

During Ferré&#x27;s administration, Puerto Rico was in an economic boom at 7% GDP growth and the unemployment at 10%.https://grupocne.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/FLMM.pdf His work as governor of Puerto Rico included defending the federal minimum wage and granting workers a Christmas bonus. He visited Puerto Rican troops in Vietnam. In 1970, his first wife, Lorencita, died at La Fortaleza after being bed-ridden for years. Their daughter, Rosario Ferré, an acclaimed novelist and writer, stepped into the role of First Lady.

During his governorship, he paid special attention to youth affairs and bringing young Puerto Ricans into public service. He successfully had the Puerto Rico Constitution amended to lower the voting age to 18, strongly supported the New Progressive Party Youth organization as party president, and appointed then-young statehooders such as Antonio Quiñones Calderón and Francisco &quot;Pompi&quot; González to high-level administration jobs, campaigned for a 26-year-old at large House candidate, nominated a future Senate President and Secretary of State, teenager Kenneth McClintock as Puerto Rico delegate to the 1971 White House Conference on Youth, and strengthened college scholarship programs.

Before the Congress created the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1971, Ferré had already created Puerto Rico&#x27;s Environmental Quality Board in 1970, charged with protecting the islands&#x27; environment.

In the elections of 1972 he sought reelection but lost to Rafael Hernández Colón of the PPD. The PPD had claimed that many corruption scandals (rather minor compared to similar ones in the various administrations following Ferré&#x27;s) had been overlooked by the Ferré administration. A bloody student strike at the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras in 1971 had been neutralized by the Puerto Rican police using brute force, something about which Ferré had mixed feelings. Hernández played the youth card in his campaign (when elected he was the youngest Puerto Rican governor). All these issues, along with the reunification of the People&#x27;s Party and the PDP, contributed to a PDP win over Ferré in the election.

Ferré remained active in politics and in 1976, he was elected to the Senate of Puerto Rico. Ferré served as the eighth president of the Senate from 1977 to 1981 and continued serving as senator until 1985.

Years after leaving La Fortaleza, he married Tiody De Jesús, a nurse who later became a physician.

After serving as senator, Ferré continued to be active in politics, especially representing the United States Republican Party on the island. Between 1989 and 1991, Ferré served with former Governor Carlos Romero Barceló, former representative Benny Frankie Cerezo, PNP leader Kenneth McClintock and former congressional staffer David Gerken as the New Progressive Party&#x27;s negotiating team while Congress considered Puerto Rico political status legislation introduced by Senator J. Bennett Johnston.

==Renaissance man==

Ferré was also a talented pianist who recorded several albums of his piano music. On January 3, 1959 he founded the Museo de Arte de Ponce, in his hometown of Ponce. The museum initially displayed 71 paintings from his personal collection and today displays over 3,000 pieces. Among other things, Ferré is credited with having rescued from oblivion the painting &quot;Flaming June&quot; by the Victorian painter Frederic Lord Leighton – purchasing it in 1963, when it was considered &quot;too old fashioned&quot; and getting it prominently displayed at the Museo of Arte de Ponce.

, the center for performing arts in Santurce, Puerto Rico also bears his name, as well as the main highway connecting San Juan and Ponce. He also assisted in the creation of the Casals Festival and the Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music. He was a member of Phi Sigma Alpha fraternity. As a sportsman, Ferré practiced fencing, and is honored annually with the &quot;Campeonato Nacional de Esgrima&quot; in Puerto Rico.

His philanthropic deeds and defense for democracy earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded by President George H. W. Bush on November 18, 1991.

==Death and legacy==

On September 29, 2003, Ferré was hospitalized with a urinary tract infection and underwent surgery for an intestinal blockage on October 1. While in the hospital, he developed pneumonia before finally succumbing to respiratory failure on the morning of October 21, 2003. He was 99 years old.

His body lay in state in Puerto Rico&#x27;s capitol building in San Juan, then transported to his museum in Ponce, before being taken for a state funeral and burial in that city. His funeral and ceremonies honoring him were attended by numerous politicians. He is interred at the Las Mercedes Memorial Park in Ponce.

Among the awards that were bestowed on Luis A. Ferré was the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an honor which was also subsequently bestowed on his sister Sor Isolina Ferre. The sculptor Tomás Batista was also commissioned to make a bust of Ferré, which is exhibited in the Ponce Museum of Art. Another Tomás Batista bust of him was unveiled by his widow, Tiody, Senate President Kenneth McClintock and Senate Vice President Orlando Parga in February, 2008 at the Senate of Puerto Rico&#x27;s Hall of Governors.

In 2004 the historic United States Courthouse and Post Office Building in Ponce, Puerto Rico was named the Luis A. Ferré United States Courthouse and Post Office Building by an Act of the U.S. Congress.

The segment of Las Américas Avenue that includes the Museo de Arte de Ponce and the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico was renamed the &quot;Luis A. Ferré Boulevard&quot; in November, 2010, in his honor.

<text>In Gamilaraay mythology, Yhi (sometimes also rendered Yarai/Yaay) is a female creator spirit and personification of the sun. She chases Bahloo (the moon) across the sky; eclipses are said to happen when she catches up to him.

According to a creation story associated with her, Yhi slept until a whistle awakened her. When she opened her eyes, light fell on the Earth. Plants grew where she walked. She decided that, in addition to plants, she would make something that could dance. Searching for such an organism, Yhi found evil spirits beneath the earth who tried to sing her to death. But her warmth chased away the darkness, which was transformed into insects. She brought them to Earth and then found some ice caves in a mountain. She shone her light on the being resting inside and fishes and lizards came out, along with many kinds of birds, mammals and amphibians.

She then returned to her own world and blessed her creations with the change of the seasons and promised that, when they died, they would join her in the sky. When she disappeared, darkness came back and covered the Earth. The organisms thought she was not returning and were sad, but then came the first sunrise and Yhi returned. 

Much later, the animals missed Yhi and she decided to return to ask them what was wrong. Kangaroo wanted to jump and Wombat wanted to wiggle on the ground, while Seal wanted to swim. Lizard wanted legs and Bat wanted wings, and the Platypus wanted something of everything. Yhi granted them what they wished, then returned to the sky and saw the Man, who had no woman and was unlike anything else she had created. While the man slept, Yhi turned all her power on a flower and soon, the man woke up and, joined by all the other animals, watched her. The flower then turned into a woman.

<doc id="95261" wikidata="Q187947" url="?curid=95261" title="Sheet music">
<text>Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of musical notation that uses musical symbols to indicate the pitches, rhythms, or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs – printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic, or other languages – the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment). However, access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, &quot;play back&quot; the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments. 

The use of the term &quot;sheet&quot; is intended to differentiate written or printed forms of music from sound recordings (on vinyl record, cassette, CD), radio or TV broadcasts or recorded live performances, which may capture film or video footage of the performance as well as the audio component. In everyday use, &quot;sheet music&quot; (or simply &quot;music&quot;) can refer to the print publication of commercial sheet music in conjunction with the release of a new film, TV show, record album, or other unique or popular event which involves music. The first printed sheet music made with a printing press was made in 1473.

Sheet music is the basic form in which Western classical music is notated so that it can be learned and performed by solo singers or instrumentalists or musical ensembles. Many forms of traditional and popular Western music are commonly learned by singers and musicians &quot;by ear&quot;, rather than by using sheet music (although in many cases, traditional and pop music may also be available in sheet music form).

The term &quot;score&quot; is a common alternative (and more generic) term for sheet music, and there are several types of scores, as discussed below. The term &quot;score&quot; can also refer to theatre music, orchestral music or songs written for a play, musical, opera or ballet, or to music or songs written for a television programme or film; for the last of these, see Film score.

==Elements==
===Title and credit===
Sheet music from the 20th and 21st century typically indicates the title of the song or composition on a title page or cover, or on the top of the first page, if there is no title page or cover. If the song or piece is from a movie, Broadway musical, or opera, the title of the main work from which the song/piece is taken may be indicated.

If the songwriter or composer is known, their name is typically indicated along with the title. The sheet music may also indicate the name of the lyric-writer, if the lyrics are by a person other than one of the songwriters or composers. It may also include the name of the arranger, if the song or piece has been arranged for the publication. No songwriter or composer name may be indicated for old folk music, traditional songs in genres such as blues and bluegrass, and very old traditional hymns and spirituals, because for this music, the authors are often unknown; in such cases, the word &quot;Traditional&quot; is often placed where the composer&#x27;s name would ordinarily go.

Title pages for songs may have a picture illustrating the characters, setting, or events from the lyrics. Title pages from instrumental works may omit an illustration, unless the work is program music which has, by its title or section names, associations with a setting, characters, or story.

===Musical notation ===
The type of musical notation varies a great deal by genre or style of music. In most classical music, the melody and accompaniment parts (if present) are notated on the lines of a staff using round note heads. In classical sheet music, the staff typically contains:

# a clef, such as bass clef or treble clef 
# a key signature indicating the key—for instance, a key signature with three sharps is typically used for the key of either A major or F minor
# a time signature, which typically has two numbers aligned vertically with the bottom number indicating the note value that represents one beat and the top number indicating how many beats are in a bar—for instance, a time signature of indicates that there are two quarter notes (crotchets) per bar.

Most songs and pieces from the Classical period () onward indicate the piece&#x27;s tempo using an expression—often in Italian—such as &quot;Allegro&quot; (fast) or &quot;Grave&quot; (slow) as well as its dynamics (loudness or softness). The lyrics, if present, are written near the melody notes. However, music from the Baroque era (–1750) or earlier eras may have neither a tempo marking nor a dynamic indication. The singers and musicians of that era were expected to know what tempo and loudness to play or sing a given song or piece due to their musical experience and knowledge. In the contemporary classical music era (20th and 21st century), and in some cases before (such as the Romantic period in German-speaking regions), composers often used their native language for tempo indications, rather than Italian (e.g., &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;schnell&quot;) or added metronome markings (e.g., = 100 beats per minute).

These conventions of classical music notation, and in particular the use of English tempo instructions, are also used for sheet music versions of 20th and 21st century popular music songs. Popular music songs often indicate both the tempo and genre: &quot;slow blues&quot; or &quot;uptempo rock&quot;. Pop songs often contain chord names above the staff using letter names (e.g., C Maj, F Maj, G7, etc.), so that an acoustic guitarist or pianist can improvise a chordal accompaniment.

In other styles of music, different musical notation methods may be used. In jazz, for example, while most professional performers can read &quot;classical&quot;-style notation, many jazz tunes are notated using chord charts, which indicate the chord progression of a song (e.g., C, A7, d minor, G7, etc.) and its form. Members of a jazz rhythm section (a piano player, jazz guitarist and bassist) use the chord chart to guide their improvised accompaniment parts, while the &quot;lead instruments&quot; in a jazz group, such as a saxophone player or trumpeter, use the chord changes to guide their solo improvisation. Like popular music songs, jazz tunes often indicate both the tempo and genre: &quot;slow blues&quot; or &quot;fast bop&quot;.

Professional country music session musicians typically use music notated in the Nashville Number System, which indicates the chord progression using numbers (this enables bandleaders to change the key at a moment&#x27;s notice). Chord charts using letter names, numbers, or Roman numerals (e.g., I–IV–V) are also widely used for notating music by blues, R&amp;B, rock music and heavy metal musicians. Some chord charts do not provide any rhythmic information, but others use slashes to indicate beats of a bar and rhythm notation to indicate syncopated &quot;hits&quot; that the songwriter wants all of the band to play together. Many guitar players and electric bass players learn songs and note tunes using tablature, which is a graphic representation of which frets and strings the performer should play. &quot;Tab&quot; is widely used by rock music and heavy metal guitarists and bassists. Singers in many popular music styles learn a song using only a lyrics sheet, learning the melody and rhythm &quot;by ear&quot; from the recording.

== Purpose and use ==

Sheet music can be used as a record of, a guide to, or a means to perform, a song or piece of music. Sheet music enables instrumental performers who are able to read music notation (a pianist, orchestral instrument players, a jazz band, etc.) or singers to perform a song or piece. Music students use sheet music to learn about different styles and genres of music. The intended purpose of an edition of sheet music affects its design and layout. If sheet music is intended for study purposes, as in a music history class, the notes and staff can be made smaller and the editor does not have to be worried about page turns. For a performance score, however, the notes have to be readable from a music stand and the editor has to avoid excessive page turns and ensure that any page turns are placed after a rest or pause (if possible). As well, a score or part in a thick bound book will not stay open, so a performance score or part needs to be in a thinner binding or use a binding format which will lie open on a music stand.

In classical music, authoritative musical information about a piece can be gained by studying the written sketches and early versions of compositions that the composer might have retained, as well as the final autograph score and personal markings on proofs and printed scores.

Comprehending sheet music requires a special form of literacy: the ability to read music notation. An ability to read or write music is not a requirement to compose music. There have been a number of composers and songwriters who have been capable of producing music without the capacity themselves to read or write in musical notation, as long as an amanuensis of some sort is available to write down the melodies they think of. Examples include the blind 18th-century composer John Stanley and the 20th-century songwriters Lionel Bart, Irving Berlin and Paul McCartney. As well, in traditional music styles such as the blues and folk music, there are many prolific songwriters who could not read music, and instead played and sang music &quot;by ear&quot;.

The skill of sight reading is the ability of a musician to perform an unfamiliar work of music upon viewing the sheet music for the first time. Sight reading ability is expected of professional musicians and serious amateurs who play classical music, jazz and related forms. An even more refined skill is the ability to look at a new piece of music and hear most or all of the sounds (melodies, harmonies, timbres, etc.) in one&#x27;s head without having to play the piece or hear it played or sung. Skilled composers and conductors have this ability, with Beethoven being a noted historical example.

Classical musicians playing orchestral works, chamber music, sonatas and singing choral works ordinarily have the sheet music in front of them on a music stand when performing (or held in front of them in a music folder, in the case of a choir), with the exception of solo instrumental performances of solo pieces, concertos, or solo vocal pieces (art song, opera arias, etc.), where memorization is expected. In jazz, which is mostly improvised, sheet music (called a &quot;lead sheet&quot; in this context) is used to give basic indications of melodies, chord changes, and arrangements. Even when a jazz band has a lead sheet, chord chart or arranged music, many elements of a performance are improvised.

Handwritten or printed music is less important in other traditions of musical practice, however, such as traditional music and folk music, in which singers and instrumentalists typically learn songs &quot;by ear&quot; or from having a song or tune taught to them by another person. Although much popular music is published in notation of some sort, it is quite common for people to learn a song by ear. This is also the case in most forms of western folk music, where songs and dances are passed down by oral – and aural – tradition. Music of other cultures, both folk and classical, is often transmitted orally, though some non-Western cultures developed their own forms of musical notation and sheet music as well.

Although sheet music is often thought of as being a platform for new music and an aid to composition (i.e., the composer &quot;writes&quot; the music down), it can also serve as a visual record of music that already exists. Scholars and others have made transcriptions to render Western and non-Western music in readable form for study, analysis and re-creative performance. This has been done not only with folk or traditional music (e.g., Bartók&#x27;s volumes of Magyar and Romanian folk music), but also with sound recordings of improvisations by musicians (e.g., jazz piano) and performances that may only partially be based on notation. An exhaustive example of the latter in recent times is the collection &quot;The Beatles: Complete Scores&quot; (London: Wise Publications, 1993), which seeks to transcribe into staves and tablature all the songs as recorded by the Beatles in instrumental and vocal detail.

==Types==
Modern sheet music may come in different formats. If a piece is composed for just one instrument or voice (such as a piece for a solo instrument or for &quot;a cappella&quot; solo voice), the whole work may be written or printed as one piece of sheet music. If an instrumental piece is intended to be performed by more than one person, each performer will usually have a separate piece of sheet music, called a &quot;part&quot;, to play from. This is especially the case in the publication of works requiring more than four or so performers, though invariably a &quot;full score&quot; is published as well. The sung parts in a vocal work are not usually issued separately today, although this was historically the case, especially before music printing made sheet music widely available.

Sheet music can be issued as individual pieces or works (for example, a popular song or a Beethoven sonata), in collections (for example works by one or several composers), as pieces performed by a given artist, etc.

When the separate instrumental and vocal parts of a musical work are printed together, the resulting sheet music is called a &quot;score&quot;. Conventionally, a score consists of musical notation with each instrumental or vocal part in vertical alignment (meaning that concurrent events in the notation for each part are arranged in parallel). The term &quot;score&quot; has also been used to refer to sheet music written for only one performer. The distinction between &quot;score&quot; and &quot;part&quot; applies when there is more than one part needed for performance.

Scores come in various formats.
=== Full scores, variants, and condensations ===

A &quot;full score&quot; is a large book showing the music of all instruments or voices in a composition lined up in a fixed order. It is large enough for a conductor to be able to read while directing orchestra or opera rehearsals and performances. In addition to their practical use for conductors leading ensembles, full scores are also used by musicologists, music theorists, composers and music students who are studying a given work. 

A &quot;miniature score&quot; is like a full score but much reduced in size. It is too small for use in a performance by a conductor, but handy for studying a piece of music, whether it be for a large ensemble or a solo performer. A miniature score may contain some introductory remarks.

A &quot;study score&quot; is sometimes the same size as, and often indistinguishable from, a miniature score, except in name. Some study scores are octavo size and are thus somewhere between full and miniature score sizes. A study score, especially when part of an anthology for academic study, may include extra comments about the music and markings for learning purposes.

A &quot;piano score&quot; (or &quot;piano reduction&quot;) is a more or less literal transcription for piano of a piece intended for many performing parts, especially orchestral works; this can include purely instrumental sections within large vocal works (see &quot;vocal score&quot; immediately below). Such arrangements are made for either piano solo (two hands) or piano duet (one or two pianos, four hands). Extra small staves are sometimes added at certain points in piano scores for two hands to make the presentation more complete, though it is usually impractical or impossible to include them while playing.

As with vocal score (below), it takes considerable skill to reduce an orchestral score to such smaller forms because the reduction needs to be not only playable on the keyboard but also thorough enough in its presentation of the intended harmonies, textures, figurations, etc. Sometimes markings are included to show which instruments are playing at given points.

While piano scores are usually not meant for performance outside of study and pleasure (Franz Liszt&#x27;s concert transcriptions of Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies being one group of notable exceptions), ballets get the most practical benefit from piano scores because with one or two pianists they allow the ballet to do many rehearsals at a much lower cost, before an orchestra has to be hired for the final rehearsals. Piano scores can also be used to train beginning conductors, who can conduct a pianist playing a piano reduction of a symphony; this is much less costly than conducting a full orchestra. Piano scores of operas do not include separate staves for the vocal parts, but they may add the sung text and stage directions above the music.

A &quot;part&quot; is an extraction from the full score of a particular instrument&#x27;s part. It is used by orchestral players in performance, where the full score would be too cumbersome. However, in practice, it can be a substantial document if the work is lengthy, and a particular instrument is playing for much of its duration.
===Vocal scores===
A &quot;vocal score&quot; (or, more properly, &quot;piano-vocal score&quot;) is a reduction of the full score of a vocal work (e.g., opera, musical, oratorio, cantata, etc.) to show the vocal parts (solo and choral) on their staves and the orchestral parts in a piano reduction (usually for two hands) underneath the vocal parts; the purely orchestral sections of the score are also reduced for piano. If a portion of the work is &quot;a cappella&quot;, a piano reduction of the vocal parts is often added to aid in rehearsal (this often is the case with &quot;a cappella&quot; religious sheet music).

Piano-vocal scores serve as a convenient way for vocal soloists and choristers to learn the music and rehearse separately from the orchestra. The vocal score of a musical typically does not include the spoken dialogue, except for cues. Piano-vocal scores are used to provide piano accompaniment for the performance of operas, musicals and oratorios by amateur groups and some small-scale professional groups. This may be done by a single piano player or by two piano players. With some 2000s-era musicals, keyboardists may play synthesizers instead of piano.

The related but less common &quot;choral score&quot; contains the choral parts with reduced accompaniment.

The comparable &quot;organ score&quot; exists as well, usually in association with church music for voices and orchestra, such as arrangements (by later hands) of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. It is like the piano-vocal score in that it includes staves for the vocal parts and reduces the orchestral parts to be performed by one person. Unlike the vocal score, the organ score is sometimes intended by the arranger to substitute for the orchestra in performance if necessary.

A collection of songs from a given musical is usually printed under the label &quot;vocal selections&quot;. This is different from the vocal score from the same show in that it does not present the complete music, and the piano accompaniment is usually simplified and includes the melody line.

===Other types===
A &quot;short score&quot; is a reduction of a work for many instruments to just a few staves. Rather than composing directly in full score, many composers work out some type of short score while they are composing and later expand the complete orchestration. An opera, for instance, may be written first in a short score, then in full score, then reduced to a vocal score for rehearsal. Short scores are often not published; they may be more common for some performance venues (e.g., band) than in others. Because of their preliminary nature, short scores are the principal reference point for those composers wishing to attempt a &#x27;completion&#x27; of another&#x27;s unfinished work (e.g. Movements 2 through 5 of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s 10th Symphony or the third act of Alban Berg&#x27;s opera &quot;Lulu&quot;).

An &quot;open score&quot; is a score of a polyphonic piece showing each voice on a separate staff. In Renaissance or Baroque keyboard pieces, open scores of four staves were sometimes used instead of the more modern convention of one staff per hand. It is also sometimes synonymous with full score (which may have more than one part per staff).

In a &quot;close score&quot;, all voice parts are represented on the two major staffs (treble and bass staffs).

Scores from the Baroque period (1600–1750) are very often in the form of a bass line in the bass clef and the melodies played by instrument or sung on an upper stave (or staves) in the treble clef. The bass line typically had figures written above the bass notes indicating which intervals above the bass (e.g., chords) should be played, an approach called &quot;figured bass&quot;. The figures indicate which intervals the harpsichordist, pipe organist or lute player should play above each bass note.

===Popular music===
A &quot;lead sheet&quot; specifies only the melody, lyrics and harmony, using one staff with chord symbols placed above and lyrics below. It is commonly used in popular music and in jazz to capture the essential elements of song without specifying the details of how the song should be arranged or performed.

A &quot;chord chart&quot; (or simply, &quot;chart&quot;) contains little or no melodic information at all but provides fundamental harmonic information. Some chord charts also indicate the rhythm that should be played, particularly if there is a syncopated series of &quot;hits&quot; that the arranger wants all of the rhythm section to perform. Otherwise, chord charts either leave the rhythm blank or indicate slashes for each beat.

This is the most common kind of written music used by professional session musicians playing jazz or other forms of popular music and is intended for the rhythm section (usually containing piano, guitar, bass and drums) to improvise their accompaniment and for any improvising soloists (e.g., saxophone players or trumpet players) to use as a reference point for their extemporized lines.

A fake book is a collection of jazz songs and tunes with just the basic elements of the music provided. There are two types of fake books: (1) collections of lead sheets, which include the melody, chords, and lyrics (if present), and (2) collections of songs and tunes with only the chords. Fake books that contain only the chords are used by rhythm section performers (notably chord-playing musicians such as electric guitarists and piano players and the bassist) to help guide their improvisation of accompaniment parts for the song. Fake books with only the chords can also be used by &quot;lead instruments&quot; (e.g., saxophone or trumpet) as a guide to their improvised solo performances. Since the melody is not included in chord-only fake books, lead instrument players are expected to know the melody.
A &quot;tablature&quot; (or &quot;tab&quot;) is a special type of musical score – most typically for a solo instrument – which shows &quot;where&quot; to play the pitches on the given instrument rather than &quot;which&quot; pitches to produce, with rhythm indicated as well. Tablature is widely used in the 2000s for guitar and electric bass songs and pieces in popular music genres such as rock music and heavy metal music. This type of notation was first used in the late Middle Ages, and it has been used for keyboard (e.g., pipe organ) and for fretted string instruments (lute, guitar).

=== Song sheets ===

Song sheets are the printed lyrics without musical notation. Academic studies of American music call these sheets &quot;songsters&quot;. Over the first half of the 20th century, lyrics to songs were printed and sold individually, in collections on newspaper-sized sheets, combined into booklets, and in magazines. Song sheets typically included photographs of famous entertainers associated with the song, as well as attributions to musical theater and films.

Song sheets were recognized as competition to sheet music by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in 1930, when a representative said, &quot;Thousands now learn the popular melodies from the radio, the publishers state. With the lyrics available for five or ten cents and the strain known, impulse to buy sheet music is eliminated.&quot; While sheet music for a song might cost thirty or thirty-five cents, a song sheet typically sold for a nickel or a dime. Choral societies would buy a single copy of the sheet music for the pianist and then multiple song sheets for the singers.

When the lyrics are printed without permission from the copyright owner, the song sheets are called bootleg song sheets. Song-sheet bootlegging was seen as a minor problem in Chicago in the early 1890s, but became a significant issue from 1929 through the 1930s. The first publishers and distributors of bootleg song sheets were charged with criminal copyright infringement in February, 1930. Through the efforts of the Music Publishers&#x27; Protective Association and law enforcement, as well as the advent of legal song sheet magazines, song-sheet bootlegging ended in the early 1940s.

The first legitimate song sheet magazines began in 1934, and Lyle Engel″s &quot;Song Hits&quot; which was first published in 1937 was successful for decades. Song sheet magazines included advertisements, gossip columns, record reviews, and promotional biographies of celebrities.

== History ==

===Precursors to sheet music===
Musical notation was developed before parchment or paper were used for writing. The earliest form of musical notation can be found in a cuneiform tablet that was created at Nippur, in Sumer (today&#x27;s Iraq), in about 2000 BC. The tablet represents fragmentary instructions for performing music, that the music was composed in harmonies of thirds, and that it was written using a diatonic scale.

A tablet from about 1250 BC shows a more developed form of notation. Although the interpretation of the notation system is still controversial, it is clear that the notation indicates the names of strings on a lyre, the tuning of which is described in other tablets. Although they are fragmentary, these tablets represent the earliest notated melodies found anywhere in the world.
Ancient Greek musical notation was in use from at least the 6th century BC until approximately the 4th century AD; several complete compositions and fragments of compositions using this notation survive. The notation consists of symbols placed above text syllables. An example of a complete composition is the Seikilos epitaph, which has been variously dated between the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD.

In ancient Greek music, three hymns by Mesomedes of Crete exist in manuscript. One of the oldest known examples of music notation is a papyrus fragment of the Hellenic era play &quot;Orestes&quot; (408 BC), which contains musical notation for a choral ode. Ancient Greek notation appears to have fallen out of use around the time of the Decline of the Roman Empire.

===Western manuscript notation===
Before the 15th century, Western music was written by hand and preserved in manuscripts, usually bound in large volumes. The best-known examples of Middle Ages music notation are medieval manuscripts of monophonic chant. Chant notation indicated the notes of the chant melody, but without any indication of the rhythm. In the case of Medieval polyphony, such as the motet, the parts were written in separate portions of facing pages. This process was aided by the advent of mensural notation, which also indicated the rhythm and was paralleled by the medieval practice of composing parts of polyphony sequentially, rather than simultaneously (as in later times). Manuscripts showing parts together in score format were rare and limited mostly to organum, especially that of the Notre Dame school. During the Middle Ages, if an Abbess wanted to have a copy of an existing composition, such as a composition owned by an Abbess in another town, she would have to hire a copyist to do the task by hand, which would be a lengthy process and one that could lead to transcription errors.

Even after the advent of music printing in the mid-1400s, much music continued to exist solely in composers&#x27; hand-written manuscripts well into the 18th century.

===Printing===
====15th century====
There were several difficulties in translating the new printing press technology to music. In the first printed book to include music, the &quot;Mainz Psalter&quot; (1457), the music notation (both staff lines and notes) was added in by hand. This is similar to the room left in other incunabula for capitals. The psalter was printed in Mainz, Germany, by Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer, and one now resides in Windsor Castle and another at the British Library. Later, staff lines were printed, but scribes still added in the rest of the music by hand. The greatest difficulty in using movable type to print music is that all the elements must line up – the note head must be properly aligned with the staff. In vocal music, text must be aligned with the proper notes (although at this time, even in manuscripts, this was not a high priority).

Music engraving is the art of drawing music notation at high quality for the purpose of mechanical reproduction. The first machine-printed music appeared around 1473, approximately 20 years after Gutenberg introduced the printing press. In 1501, Ottaviano Petrucci published &quot;Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A&quot;, which contained 96 pieces of printed music. Petrucci&#x27;s printing method produced clean, readable, elegant music, but it was a long, difficult process that required three separate passes through the printing press. Petrucci later developed a process which required only two passes through the press. But it was still taxing since each pass required very precise alignment for the result to be legible (i.e., so that the note heads would be correctly lined up with the staff lines). This was the first well-distributed printed polyphonic music. Petrucci also printed the first tablature with movable type. Single impression printing, in which the staff lines and notes could be printed in one pass, first appeared in London around 1520. Pierre Attaingnant brought the technique into wide use in 1528, and it remained little changed for 200 years.
A common format for issuing multi-part, polyphonic music during the Renaissance was &quot;partbooks&quot;. In this format, each voice-part for a collection of five-part madrigals, for instance, would be printed separately in its own book, such that all five part-books would be needed to perform the music. The same partbooks could be used by singers or instrumentalists. Scores for multi-part music were rarely printed in the Renaissance, although the use of score format as a means to compose parts simultaneously (rather than successively, as in the late Middle Ages) is credited to Josquin des Prez.

The effect of printed music was similar to the effect of the printed word, in that information spread faster, more efficiently, at a lower cost, and to more people than it could through laboriously hand-copied manuscripts. It had the additional effect of encouraging amateur musicians of sufficient means, who could now afford sheet music, to perform. This in many ways affected the entire music industry. Composers could now write more music for amateur performers, knowing that it could be distributed and sold to the middle class.

This meant that composers did not have to depend solely on the patronage of wealthy aristocrats. Professional players could have more music at their disposal and they could access music from different countries. It increased the number of amateurs, from whom professional players could then earn money by teaching them. Nevertheless, in the early years, the cost of printed music limited its distribution. Another factor that limited the impact of printed music was that in many places, the right to print music was granted by the monarch, and only those with a special dispensation were allowed to do so, giving them a monopoly. This was often an honour (and economic boon) granted to favoured court musicians or composers.

====16th century====

Mechanical plate engraving was developed in the late sixteenth century. Although plate engraving had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581. In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. Copper was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century, pewter became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.

Plate engraving was the methodology of choice for music printing until the late nineteenth century, at which point its decline was hastened by the development of photographic technology. Nevertheless, the technique has survived to the present day and is still occasionally used by select publishers such as G. Henle Verlag in Germany.

As musical composition increased in complexity, so too did the technology required to produce accurate musical scores. Unlike literary printing, which mainly contains printed words, music engraving communicates several different types of information simultaneously. To be clear to musicians, it is imperative that engraving techniques allow absolute precision. Notes of chords, dynamic markings, and other notation line up with vertical accuracy. If text is included, each syllable matches vertically with its assigned melody. Horizontally, subdivisions of beats are marked not only by their flags and beams, but also by the relative space between them on the page. The logistics of creating such precise copies posed several problems for early music engravers, and have resulted in the development of several music engraving technologies.

====19th century====

In the 19th century, the music industry was dominated by sheet music publishers. In the mid-century, copyright control of melodies was not strict, and publishers would often print their own versions of the songs popular at the time. Some composers, such as J.N. Pattison, countered by publishing their own sheet music. Pattison operated out of a piano and organ salesroom in Union Square in downtown Manhattan. After 1885, New York music publishing was dominated by a group of songwriters and composers known as &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot;. With stronger copyright protection laws late in the century, songwriters, composers, lyricists, and publishers started working together for their mutual financial benefit. New York City publishers concentrated on vocal music. The biggest music houses established themselves in New York City, but small local publishers – often connected with commercial printers or music stores – continued to flourish throughout the country. An extraordinary number of East European immigrants became the music publishers and songwriters on Tin Pan Alley-the most famous being Irving Berlin. Songwriters who became established producers of successful songs were hired to be on the staff of the music houses.

In the United States, the sheet music industry rose in tandem with blackface minstrelsy, as well as parlour music. The late-19th century saw a massive explosion of parlour music, with ownership of, and skill at playing the piano becoming &quot;de rigueur&quot; for the middle-class family. In the late-19th century, if a middle-class family wanted to hear a popular new song or piece, they would buy the sheet music and then perform the song or piece in an amateur fashion in their home. But in the early 20th century the phonograph and recorded music grew greatly in importance. This, joined by the growth in popularity of radio broadcasting from the 1920s on, lessened the importance of the sheet music publishers. The record industry eventually replaced the sheet music publishers as the music industry&#x27;s largest force.

===20th century and early 21st century===

In the late 20th and into the 21st century, significant interest has developed in representing sheet music in a computer-readable format (see music notation software), as well as downloadable files. Music OCR, software to &quot;read&quot; scanned sheet music so that the results can be manipulated, has been available since 1991.

In 1998, virtual sheet music evolved further into what was to be termed digital sheet music, which for the first time allowed publishers to make copyright sheet music available for purchase online. Unlike their hard copy counterparts, these files allowed for manipulation such as instrument changes, transposition and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) playback. The popularity of this instant delivery system among musicians appears to be acting as a catalyst of new growth for the industry well into the foreseeable future.

An early computer notation program available for home computers was Music Construction Set, developed in 1984 and released for several different platforms. Introducing concepts largely unknown to the home user of the time, it allowed manipulation of notes and symbols with a pointing device such as a mouse; the user would &quot;grab&quot; a note or symbol from a palette and &quot;drop&quot; it onto the staff in the correct location. The program allowed playback of the produced music through various early sound cards, and could print the musical score on a graphics printer.

Many software products for modern digital audio workstation and scorewriters for general personal computers support generation of sheet music from MIDI files, by a performer playing the notes on a MIDI-equipped keyboard or other MIDI controller or by manual entry using a mouse or other computer device.

By 1999, a system and method for coordinating music display among players in an orchestra was patented by Harry Connick Jr. It is a device with a computer screen which is used to show the sheet music for the musicians in an orchestra instead of the more commonly used paper. Connick uses this system when touring with his big band, for instance. With the proliferation of wireless networks and iPads similar systems have been developed. In the classical music world, some string quartet groups use computer screen-based parts. There are several advantages to computer-based parts. Since the score is on a computer screen, the user can adjust the contrast, brightness and even the size of the notes, to make reading easier. In addition, some systems will do &quot;page turns&quot; using a foot pedal, which means that the performer does not have to miss playing music during a page turn, as often occurs with paper parts.

Of special practical interest for the general public is the Mutopia project, an effort to create a library of public domain sheet music, comparable to Project Gutenberg&#x27;s library of public domain books. The International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP) is also attempting to create a virtual library containing all public domain musical scores, as well as scores from composers who are willing to share their music with the world free of charge.

Some scorewriter computer programs have a feature that is very useful for composers and arrangers: the ability to &quot;play back&quot; the notated music using synthesizer sounds or virtual instruments. Due to the high cost of hiring a full symphony orchestra to play a new composition, before the development of these computer programs, many composers and arrangers were only able to hear their orchestral works by arranging them for piano, organ or string quartet. While a scorewiter program&#x27;s playback will not contain the nuances of a professional orchestra recording, it still conveys a sense of the tone colors created by the piece and of the interplay of the different parts.

=== Infiltration of western staff notation in other cultures===
Outside modern western cultures there exists a wide variety of systems of musical notation, each adapted to the particular needs of the musical cultures in question, and some highly evolved classical musics do not use notation at all (or only in rudimentary forms as mnemonic aids) such as the khyal and dhrupad forms of Northern India. Western musical notation systems are ill-equipped to describe musics of other types, such as the courtly forms of Japanese gagaku, Indian dhrupad, or the percussive music of ewe drumming. The infiltration of Western staff notation into these cultures has been described by the musicologist Alain Daniélou and Reebee Garofalo as a process of cultural imperialism.

<text>In Gamilaraay mythology, Wurrunna (also Wurrunnah) is a culture hero.

The Dreamtime story of the black swans tells how two brothers were turned into white swans so they could help an attack party during a raid for weapons. Wurrunna used a large &quot;gubbera&quot;, or crystal stone, to transform the men. After the raid, eaglehawks attacked the white swans and tore feathers from the birds. Crows who were enemies of the eaglehawks came to the aid of the brothers and gave the black swans their own black feathers. The black swan&#x27;s red beak is said to be the blood of the attacked brothers, which stayed there forever.

<text>In the mythology of the Tiwi people of northern Australia, the Sun Woman Wuriupranili (or Wuriunpranilli) is a solar goddess whose stringybark torch is the Sun. When she wakes each morning in the east, she lights a small fire, which mankind sees as the first glow of dawn. She then decorates her face and body with red ochre. Often, the pigment is blown into the air where it stains the clouds, resulting in a red sunrise. As Wuriupranili prepares herself for her journey across the sky, the birds break into song, waking the men and women. Finally, she lights her stringybark torch from the campfire, then travels across the sky to her evening camp in the west. When she disappears below the western horizon, she puts out her torch and redecorates her body with ochre, causing brilliantly-coloured sunsets. As night settles, she returns to her eastern morning camp via a tunnel.

<text>Jean William Fritz Piaget (, ; ; 9 August 1896 – 16 September 1980) was a Swiss psychologist known for his work on child development. Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development and epistemological view are together called genetic epistemology.

Piaget placed great importance on the education of children. As the Director of the International Bureau of Education, he declared in 1934 that &quot;only education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse, whether violent, or gradual&quot;. His theory of child development has been studied in pre-service education programs. Nowadays, educators and theorists working in the area of early childhood education persist in incorporating constructivist-based strategies.

Piaget created the International Center for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva in 1955 while on the faculty of the University of Geneva, and directed the center until his death in 1980. The number of collaborations that its founding made possible, and their impact, ultimately led to the Center being referred to in the scholarly literature as &quot;Piaget&#x27;s factory&quot;.

According to Ernst von Glasersfeld, Piaget was &quot;the great pioneer of the constructivist theory of knowing&quot;. His ideas were widely popularized in the 1960s. This then led to the emergence of the study of development as a major sub-discipline in psychology. By the end of the 20th century, he was second only to B. F. Skinner as the most-cited psychologist.

==Personal life==
Piaget was born in 1896 in Neuchâtel, in the Francophone region of Switzerland. He was the oldest son of Arthur Piaget (Swiss), a professor of medieval literature at the University of Neuchâtel, and Rebecca Jackson (French). Rebecca Jackson came from a prominent family of French steel foundry owners of English descent through her Lancashire-born great-grandfather, steelmaker James Jackson. Piaget was a precocious child who developed an interest in biology and the natural world. His early interest in zoology earned him a reputation among those in the field after he had published several articles on mollusks by the age of 15.

When he was 15, his former nanny wrote to his parents to apologize for having once lied to them about fighting off a would-be kidnapper from baby Jean&#x27;s pram. There never was a kidnapper. Piaget became fascinated that he had somehow formed a memory of this kidnapping incident, a memory that endured even after he understood it to be false.

He developed an interest in epistemology due to his godfather&#x27;s urgings to study the fields of philosophy and logic. He was educated at the University of Neuchâtel, and studied briefly at the University of Zürich. During this time, he published two philosophical papers that showed the direction of his thinking at the time, but which he later dismissed as adolescent thought. His interest in psychoanalysis, at the time a burgeoning strain of psychology, can also be dated to this period.

Piaget moved from Switzerland to Paris after his graduation and he taught at the Grange-Aux-Belles Street School for Boys. The school was run by Alfred Binet, the developer of the Binet-Simon test (later revised by Lewis Terman to become the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales). Piaget assisted in the marking of Binet&#x27;s intelligence tests. It was while he was helping to mark some of these tests that Piaget noticed that young children consistently gave wrong answers to certain questions. Piaget did not focus so much on the fact of the children&#x27;s answers being wrong, but that young children consistently made types of mistakes that older children and adults managed to avoid. This led him to the theory that young children&#x27;s cognitive processes are inherently different from those of adults. Ultimately, he was to propose a global theory of cognitive developmental stages in which individuals exhibit certain common patterns of cognition in each period of development.

In 1921, Piaget returned to Switzerland as director of the Rousseau Institute in Geneva. At this time, the institute was directed by Édouard Claparède. Piaget was familiar with many of Claparède&#x27;s ideas, including that of the psychological concept of &quot;groping&quot; which was closely associated with &quot;trials and errors&quot; observed in human mental patterns.

In 1923, he married Valentine Châtenay (7 January 1899 – 3 July 1983); the couple had three children, whom Piaget studied from infancy. From 1925 to 1929, Piaget worked as a professor of psychology, sociology, and the philosophy of science at
the University of Neuchatel. In 1929, Piaget accepted the post of Director of the International Bureau of Education and remained the head of this international organization until 1968. Every year, he drafted his &quot;Director&#x27;s Speeches&quot; for the IBE Council and for the International Conference on Public Education in which he explicitly addressed his educational credo.

Having taught at the University of Geneva, and at the University of Paris in 1964, Piaget was invited to serve as chief consultant at two conferences at Cornell University (11–13 March) and the University of California, Berkeley (16–18 March). The conferences addressed the relationship of cognitive studies and curriculum development, and strived to conceive implications of recent investigations of children&#x27;s cognitive development for curricula.

In 1972 Piaget was awarded the Erasmus Prize and in 1979 the Balzan Prize for Social and Political Sciences. Piaget died on 16 September 1980, and, as he had requested, was buried with his family in an unmarked grave in the Cimetière des Rois (Cemetery of Kings) in Geneva.

==Career history==
Harry Beilin described Piaget&#x27;s theoretical research program as consisting of four phases:
# the sociological model of development,
# the biological model of intellectual development,
# the elaboration of the logical model of intellectual development,
# the study of figurative thought.
The resulting theoretical frameworks are sufficiently different from each other that they have been characterized as representing different &quot;Piagets&quot;. More recently, Jeremy Burman responded to Beilin and called for the addition of a phase before his turn to psychology: &quot;the zeroth Piaget&quot;.

===Before becoming a psychologist===
Before Piaget became a psychologist, he trained in natural history and philosophy. He received a doctorate in 1918 from the University of Neuchâtel. He then undertook post-doctoral training in Zürich (1918–1919), and Paris (1919–1921). He was hired by Théodore Simon to standardize psychometric measures for use with French children in 1919. The theorist we recognize today only emerged when he moved to Geneva, to work for Édouard Claparède as director of research at the Rousseau Institute, in 1922.

===Sociological model of development===
Piaget first developed as a psychologist in the 1920s. He investigated the hidden side of children&#x27;s minds. Piaget proposed that children moved from a position of egocentrism to sociocentrism. For this explanation he combined the use of psychological and clinical methods to create what he called a semiclinical interview. He began the interview by asking children standardized questions and depending on how they answered, he would ask them a series of standard questions. Piaget was looking for what he called &quot;spontaneous conviction&quot; so he often asked questions the children neither expected nor anticipated. In his studies, he noticed there was a gradual progression from intuitive to scientific and socially acceptable responses. Piaget theorized children did this because of the social interaction and the challenge to younger children&#x27;s ideas by the ideas of those children who were more advanced.

This work was used by Elton Mayo as the basis for the famous Hawthorne Experiments. For Piaget, it also led to an honorary doctorate from Harvard in 1936.

===Biological model of intellectual development===
In this stage, Piaget believed that the process of thinking and intellectual development could be regarded as an extension of the biological process of the (adaptation) of the species, which has also two ongoing processes: assimilation and accommodation. There is &quot;assimilation&quot; when a child responds to a new event in a way that is consistent with an existing schema. There is &quot;accommodation&quot; when a child either modifies an existing schema or forms an entirely new schema to deal with a new object or event.

He argued infants were engaging in the act of assimilation when they sucked on everything in their reach. He claimed infants transform all objects into an object to be sucked. The children were assimilating the objects to conform to their own mental structures. Piaget then made the assumption that whenever one transforms the world to meet individual needs or conceptions, one is, in a way, assimilating it. Piaget also observed his children not only assimilating objects to fit their needs, but also modifying some of their mental structures to meet the demands of the environment. This is the second division of adaptation known as accommodation. To start, the infants only engaged in primarily reflex actions such as sucking, but not long after, they would pick up objects and put them in their mouths. When they do this, they modify their reflex response to accommodate the external objects into reflex actions. Because the two are often in conflict, they provide the impetus for intellectual developmentthe constant need to balance the two triggers intellectual growth.

To test his theory, Piaget observed the habits in his own children.

===Elaboration of the logical model of intellectual development===
In the model Piaget developed in stage three, he argued that intelligence develops in a series of stages that are related to age and are progressive because one stage must be accomplished before the next can occur. For each stage of development the child forms a view of reality for that age period. At the next stage, the child must keep up with earlier level of mental abilities to reconstruct concepts. Piaget conceived intellectual development as an upward expanding spiral in which children must constantly reconstruct the ideas formed at earlier levels with new, higher order concepts acquired at the next level.

It is primarily the &quot;Third Piaget&quot; (the logical model of intellectual development) that was debated by American psychologists when Piaget&#x27;s ideas were &quot;rediscovered&quot; in the 1960s.

===Study of figurative thought===
Piaget studied areas of intelligence like perception and memory that are not entirely logical. Logical concepts are described as being completely reversible because they can always get back to the starting point, meaning that if one starts with a given premise and follows logical steps to reach a conclusion, the same steps may be done in the opposite order, starting from the conclusion to arrive at the premise. The perceptual concepts Piaget studied could not be manipulated. To describe the figurative process, Piaget uses pictures as examples. Pictures cannot be separated because contours cannot be separated from the forms they outline. Memory is the same way: it is never completely reversible; people cannot necessarily recall all the intervening events between two points. During this last period of work, Piaget and his colleague Inhelder also published books on perception, memory, and other figurative processes such as learning.

Because Piaget&#x27;s theory is based upon biological maturation and stages, the notion of readiness is important. Readiness concerns when certain information or concepts should be taught. According to Piaget&#x27;s theory, children should not be taught certain concepts until they reached the appropriate stage of cognitive development. For example, young children in the preoperational stage engage in &quot;irreversible&quot; thought and cannot comprehend that an item that has been transformed in some way may be returned to its original state.

==Theory==

Piaget defined himself as a &#x27;genetic&#x27; epistemologist, interested in the process of the qualitative development of knowledge. He considered cognitive structures&#x27; development as a differentiation of biological regulations. When his entire theory first became known – the theory in itself being based on a structuralist and a cognitivitist approach – it was an outstanding and exciting development in regards to the psychological community at that time.

There are a total of four phases in Piaget&#x27;s research program that included books on certain topics of developmental psychology. In particular, during one period of research, he described himself studying his own three children, and carefully observing and interpreting their cognitive development. In one of his last books, &quot;Equilibration of Cognitive Structures: The Central Problem of Intellectual Development&quot;, he intends to explain knowledge development as a process of equilibration using two main concepts in his theory, assimilation and accommodation, as belonging not only to biological interactions but also to cognitive ones.

He stated that children are born with limited capabilities and their cognition ability develops with age.

Piaget believed answers for the epistemological questions at his time could be answered, or better proposed, if one looked to the genetic aspect of it, hence his experimentations with children and adolescents. As he says in the introduction of his book &quot;Genetic Epistemology&quot;: &quot;What the genetic epistemology proposes is discovering the roots of the different varieties of knowledge, since its elementary forms, following to the next levels, including also the scientific knowledge.&quot;

===Stages===
The four development stages are described in Piaget&#x27;s theory as:

===Psychology of functions and correspondences===
Piaget had sometimes been criticized for characterizing preoperational children in terms of the cognitive capacities they lacked, rather than their cognitive accomplishments. A &quot;late turn&quot; in the development of Piaget&#x27;s theory saw the emergence of work on the accomplishments of those children within the framework of his psychology of functions and correspondences. This new phase in Piaget&#x27;s work was less stage-dependent and reflected greater continuity in human development than would be expected in a stage-bound theory. This advance in his work took place toward the end of his very productive life and is sometimes absent from developmental psychology textbooks.

An example of a function can involve sets X and Y and ordered pairs of elements (x,y), in which x is an element of X and y, Y. In a function, an element of X is mapped onto exactly one element of Y (the reverse need not be true). A function therefore involves a unique mapping in one direction, or, as Piaget and his colleagues have written, functions are &quot;univocal to the right&quot; (Piaget et al., 1977, p. 14). When each element of X maps onto exactly one element of Y &quot;and&quot; each element of Y maps onto exactly one element of X, Piaget and colleagues indicated that the uniqueness condition holds in either direction and called the relationship between the elements of X and Y &quot;biunivocal&quot; or &quot;one-to-one&quot;. They advanced the idea that the preoperational child manifests some understanding of one-way order functions.

According to Piaget&#x27;s Genevan colleagues, the &quot;semilogic&quot; of these order functions sustains the preoperational child&#x27;s ability to use of spatial extent to index and compare quantities. The child, for example, could use the length of an array to index the number of objects in the array. Thus, the child would judge the longer of two arrays as having the greater number of objects. Although imperfect, such comparisons are often fair (&quot;semilogical&quot;) substitutes for exact quantification. Furthermore, these order functions underlie the child&#x27;s rudimentary knowledge of environmental regularities. Young children are capable of constructing—this reflects the constructivist bent of Piaget&#x27;s work—sequences of objects of alternating color. They also have an understanding of the pairwise exchanges of cards having pictures of different flowers.

Piaget and colleagues have examined morphisms, which to them differ from the operative transformations observed on concrete operational children. Piaget (1977) wrote that &quot;correspondences and morphisms are essentially comparisons that do not transform objects to be compared but that extract common forms from them or analogies between them&quot; (p. 351). He advanced the idea that this type of knowledge emerges from &quot;primitive applications&quot; of action schemes to objects in the environment. In one study of morphisms, Piaget and colleagues asked children to identify items in a series of movable red cutouts that could cover a pre-specified section of each of four base cards—each card had a red area and a white area. The task, in effect, asked the child to superimpose the cut-outs on a base card to make the entire card appear to be red. Although there were 12 cutouts in all, only three, which differed slightly from each other, could make an entire base card look red. The youngest children studied—they were age 5—could match, using trial and error, one cut-out to one base card. Piaget et al. called this type of morphism bijection, a term-by-term correspondence. Older children were able to do more by figuring out how to make entire card appear to be red by using three cutouts. In other words, they could perform three to one matching. Piaget et al. (1977) called a many-to-one match surjection.

=== Developmental process ===
Piaget provided no concise description of the development process as a whole. Broadly speaking it consisted of a cycle:

*The child performs an action which has an effect on or organizes objects, and the child is able to note the characteristics of the action and its effects.
*Through repeated actions, perhaps with variations or in different contexts or on different kinds of objects, the child is able to differentiate and integrate its elements and effects. This is the process of &quot;reflecting abstraction&quot; (described in detail in Piaget 2001).
*At the same time, the child is able to identify the properties of objects by the way different kinds of actions affect them. This is the process of &quot;empirical abstraction&quot;.
*By repeating this process across a wide range of objects and actions, the child establishes a new level of knowledge and insight. This is the process of forming a new &quot;cognitive stage&quot;. This dual process allows the child to construct new ways of dealing with objects and new knowledge about objects themselves.
*Once the child has constructed these new kinds of knowledge, he or she starts to use them to create still more complex objects and to carry out still more complex actions. As a result, the child starts to recognize still more complex patterns and to construct still more complex objects. Thus a new stage begins, which will only be completed when all the child&#x27;s activity and experience have been re-organized on this still higher level.

This process may not be wholly gradual, but new evidence shows that the passage into new stages is more gradual than once thought. Once a new level of organization, knowledge and insight proves to be effective, it will quickly be generalized to other areas &quot;if they exist&quot;. As a result, transitions between stages can seem to be rapid and radical, but oftentimes the child has grasped one aspect of the new stage of cognitive functioning but not addressed others. The bulk of the time spent in a new stage consists of refining this new cognitive level; it does not always happen quickly. For example, a child may see that two different colors of Play-Doh have been fused together to make one ball, based on the color. If sugar is mixed into water or iced tea, then the sugar &quot;disappeared&quot; and therefore does not exist to the child at that stage. These levels of one concept of cognitive development are not realized all at once, giving us a gradual realization of the world around us.

It is because this process takes this dialectical form, in which each new stage is created through the further differentiation, integration, and synthesis of new structures out of the old, that the sequence of cognitive stages are logically necessary rather than simply empirically correct. Each new stage emerges only because the child can take for granted the achievements of its predecessors, and yet there are still more sophisticated forms of knowledge and action that are capable of being developed.

Because it covers both how we gain knowledge about objects and our reflections on our own actions, Piaget&#x27;s model of development explains a number of features of human knowledge that had never previously been accounted for. For example, by showing how children progressively enrich their understanding of things by acting on and reflecting on the effects of their own previous knowledge, they are able to organize their knowledge in increasingly complex structures. Thus, once a young child can consistently and accurately recognize different kinds of animals, he or she then acquires the ability to organize the different kinds into higher groupings such as &quot;birds&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, and so on. This is significant because they are now able to know things about a new animal simply on the basis of the fact that it is a bird – for example, that it will lay eggs.

At the same time, by reflecting on their own actions, children develop an increasingly sophisticated awareness of the &quot;rules&quot; that govern them in various ways. For example, it is by this route that Piaget explains this child&#x27;s growing awareness of notions such as &quot;right&quot;, &quot;valid&quot;, &quot;necessary&quot;, &quot;proper&quot;, and so on. In other words, it is through the process of objectification, reflection and abstraction that the child constructs the principles on which action is not only effective or correct but also &quot;justified&quot;.

One of Piaget&#x27;s most famous studies focused purely on the discriminative abilities of children between the ages of two and a half years old, and four and a half years old. He began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets, one with the sweets in a line spread further apart, and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together. He found that, &quot;Children between 2 years, 6 months old and 3 years, 2 months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows; between 3 years, 2 months and 4 years, 6 months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have &quot;more&quot;; after 4 years, 6 months they again discriminate correctly&quot; (&quot;Cognitive Capacity of Very Young Children&quot;, p. 141). Initially younger children were not studied, because if at four years old a child could not conserve quantity, then a younger child presumably could not either. The results show that children that are younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation, but as they get older they lose this quality, and do not recover it until four and a half years old. This attribute may be lost due to a temporary inability to solve because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies, which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy, or due to the inability for a four-year-old to reverse situations.

By the end of this experiment several results were found. First, younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than acknowledged. This study also reveals that young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations, depending on how logical the structure of the task is. Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age 5 and as a result, the child will count the sweets to decide which has more. Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans&#x27; native inheritance.

=== Genetic epistemology ===
According to Piaget, genetic epistemology attempts to &quot;explain knowledge, and in particular scientific knowledge, on the basis of its history, its sociogenesis, and especially the psychological origins of the notions and operations upon which it is based&quot;. Piaget believed he could test epistemological questions by studying the development of thought and action in children. As a result, Piaget created a field known as genetic epistemology with its own methods and problems. He defined this field as the study of child development as a means of answering epistemological questions.

===Schema===
A schema (plural form: &quot;schemata&quot;) is a structured cluster of concepts, it can be used to represent objects, scenarios or sequences of events or relations. The philosopher Immanuel Kant first proposed the concept of schemata as innate structures used to help us perceive the world.

A schema is a mental framework that is created as children interact with their physical and social environments. For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive because it comes up in the morning and goes down at night. According to Piaget, these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret and respond to the same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.

Piaget (1953) described three kinds of intellectual structures: behavioural (or sensorimotor) schemata, symbolic schemata, and operational schemata.

*&quot;Behavioural schemata&quot;: organized patterns of behaviour that are used to represent and respond to objects and experiences.
*&quot;Symbolic schemata&quot;: internal mental symbols (such as images or verbal codes) that one uses to represent aspects of experience.
*&quot;Operational schemata&quot;: internal mental activity that one performs on objects of thought.

According to Piaget, children use the process of assimilation and accommodation to create a schema or mental framework for how they perceive and/or interpret what they are experiencing. As a result, the early concepts of young children tend to be more global or general in nature.

Similarly, Gallagher and Reid (1981) maintained that adults view children&#x27;s concepts as highly generalized and even inaccurate. With added experience, interactions, and maturity, these concepts become refined and more detailed. Overall, making sense of the world from a child&#x27;s perspective is a very complex and time-consuming process.

A schema is:
*A critically important building block of conceptual development
*Constantly in the process of being modified or changed
*Modified by on-going experiences
*A generalized idea, usually based on experience or prior knowledge.

These schemata are constantly being revised and elaborated upon each time the child encounters new experiences. In doing this children create their own unique understanding of the world, interpret their own experiences and knowledge, and subsequently use this knowledge to solve more complex problems. In a neurological sense, the brain/mind is constantly working to build and rebuild itself as it takes in, adapts/modifies new information, and enhances understanding.

==Research methods==

Piaget wanted to revolutionize the way research was conducted. Although he started researching with his colleagues using a traditional method of data collection, he was not fully satisfied with the results and wanted to keep trying to find new ways of researching using a combination of data, which included naturalistic observation, psychometrics, and the psychiatric clinical examination, in order to have a less guided form of research that would produce more empirically valid results.
As Piaget developed new research methods, he wrote a book called &quot;The Language and Thought of the Child&quot;, which aimed to synthesize the methods he was using in order to study the conclusions children drew from situations and how they arrived at such conclusions. The main idea was to observe how children responded and articulated certain situations with their own reasoning, in order to examine their thought processes (Mayer, 2005).

Piaget administered a test in 15 boys with ages ranging from 10 to 14 years in which he asked participants to describe the relationship between a mixed bouquet of flowers and a bouquet with flowers of the same color. The purpose of this study was to analyze the thinking process the boys had and to draw conclusions about the logic processes they had used, which was a psychometric technique of research. Piaget also used the psychoanalytic method initially developed by Sigmund Freud. The purpose of using such method was to examine the unconscious mind, as well as to continue parallel studies using different research methods. Psychoanalysis was later rejected by Piaget, as he thought it was insufficiently empirical (Mayer, 2005).

Piaget argued that children and adults used speech for different purposes. In order to confirm his argument, he experimented analyzing a child&#x27;s interpretation of a story. In the experiment, the child listened to a story and then told a friend that same story in his/her/their own words. The purpose of this study was to examine how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention. Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation, in order to understand a child&#x27;s reasoning. He realized the difficulty of studying children&#x27;s thoughts, as it is hard to know if a child is pretending to believe their thoughts or not. Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children&#x27;s conversations in a social context – starting from examining their speech and actions – where children were comfortable and spontaneous (Kose, 1987).

===Issues and possible solutions===

After conducting many studies, Piaget found significant differences in the way adults and children reason. He could not find the path of logic reasoning and the unspoken thoughts children had, which would allow him to study a child&#x27;s intellectual development over time (Mayer, 2005). In his third book, &quot;The Child&#x27;s Conception of the World&quot;, Piaget recognized the difficulties of his prior techniques and the importance of psychiatric clinical examination. The researcher believed that the way clinical examinations were conducted influenced how a child&#x27;s inner realities surfaced. Children would likely respond according to the way the research is conducted, the questions asked, or the familiarity they have with the environment. The clinical examination conducted for his third book provides a thorough investigation into a child&#x27;s thinking process. An example of a question used to research such process was: &quot;Can you see a thought?&quot; (Mayer, 2005, p. 372).

===Piaget replaces psychometric tests with the clinical method approach===
Piaget recognized that psychometric tests had its limitations, as children were not able to provide the researcher with their deepest thoughts and inner intellect. It was also difficult to know if the results of child examination reflected what children believed or if it is just a pretend situation. For example, it is very difficult to know with certainty if a child who has a conversation with a toy believes the toy is alive or if the child is just pretending. Soon after drawing conclusions about psychometric studies, Piaget started developing the clinical method of examination. The clinical method included questioning a child and carefully examining their responses – in order to observe how the child reasoned according to the questions asked – and then examining the child&#x27;s perception of the world through their responses. Piaget recognized the difficulties of interviewing a child and the importance of recognizing the difference between &quot;liberated&quot; versus &quot;spontaneous&quot; responses (Mayer, 2005, p. 372).

Piaget wanted to research in environments that would allow children to connect with some existing aspects of the world. The idea was to change the approach described in his book &quot;The Child&#x27;s Conception of the World&quot; and move away from the vague questioning interviews. This new approach was described in his book &quot;The Child&#x27;s Conception of Physical Causality&quot;, where children were presented with dilemmas and had to think of possible solutions on their own. Later, after carefully analyzing previous methods, Piaget developed a combination of naturalistic observation with clinical interviewing in his book &quot;Judgment and Reasoning in the Child&quot;, where a child&#x27;s intellect was tested with questions and close monitoring. Piaget was convinced he had found a way to analyze and access a child&#x27;s thoughts about the world in a very effective way (Mayer, 2005). Piaget&#x27;s research provided a combination of theoretical and practical research methods and it has offered a crucial contribution to the field of developmental psychology (Beilin, 1992). &quot;Piaget is often criticized because his method of investigation, though somewhat modified in recent years, is still largely clinical&quot;. He observes a child&#x27;s surroundings and behavior. He then comes up with a hypothesis testing it and focusing on both the surroundings and behavior after changing a little of the surrounding.

== Influence ==

Despite his ceasing to be a fashionable psychologist, the magnitude of Piaget&#x27;s continuing influence can be measured by the global scale and activity of the Jean Piaget Society, which holds annual conferences and attracts around 700 participants. His theory of cognitive development has proved influential in many different areas:

=== Developmental psychology ===
Piaget is considered the most influential figure in developmental psychology, though many of aspects of his theories are no longer accepted by mainstream psychologists. Developmental psychologists today do not view development as taking place in stages and many of Piaget&#x27;s empirical findings have been overturned by subsequent research. For example, psychologists no longer view young children as being incapable of understanding abstract concepts, and no longer believe that babies do not understand object permanence. Despite this, developmental psychologists do acknowledge the importance of Piaget&#x27;s legacy as the founder of their field. They recognize his innovative empirical work, his attempts to integrate his results into a unified theoretical model and the way he created a path for subsequent researchers to follow. Indeed, many developmental psychology researchers today work in a post-Piagetian or neo-Piagetian framework.

=== Education ===

By using Piaget&#x27;s theory, educators focus on their students as learners. As a result of this focus, education is learner-centered and constructivist-based to an extent. It allows teachers to view students as individual learners who add new concepts to prior knowledge to construct, or build, understanding for themselves. Teachers who use a learner-centered approach as a basis for their professional practices incorporate the several dispositions. They provide experience-based educational opportunities. These teachers also contemplate the learners&#x27; individual qualities and attitudes during curriculum planning. Educators allow learners&#x27; insights to alter the curriculum. They nourish and support learners&#x27; curiosity. They also involve learners&#x27; emotions and create a learning environment in which students feel safe.

There are two differences between the preoperational and concrete operational stages that apply to education. These differences are reversibility and decentration. At times, reversibility and decentration occur at the same time. When students think about the steps to complete a task without using a particular logical, sequential order, they are using reversibility. Decentration allows them to concentrate on multiple components of a problematic task at a time. Students use both reversibility and decentration to function throughout the school day, follow directions, and complete assignments.

An example of a student using reversibility is when learning new vocabulary. The student creates a list of unfamiliar words from a literary text. Then, he researches the definition of those words before asking classmate to test him. His teacher has given a set of particular instructions that he must follow in a particular order: he must write the word before defining it, and complete these two steps repeatedly. A child in the preoperational stage gets confused during this process and needs assistance from the teacher to stay on task. The teacher refers him back to his text in order to notate the next word before he can define it. A child in the preoperational stage does not understand the organization required to complete this assignment. One in the concrete operational stage understands the organization, and can recall the steps in any order while being able to follow the order given. Using decentration, the child has the two activities on his mind: identify words and find them in the dictionary.

A sample of decentration is a preschooler may use a toy banana as a pretend telephone. The child knows the difference between the fruit and a phone. In this form of play, he is operating on two levels at once. In an older child at the concrete operational level, decentration allows him to complete subtraction of two-digit numbers and indicate which of the problems also involved borrowing from the other column. The student simultaneously does both. Using reversibility, the student has to move mentally between two subtasks.

Regarding the giving of praise by teachers, praise is a reinforcer for students. Adolescents undergo social-emotional development such that they seek rapport with peers. Thus, teacher praise is not as powerful for students who see teachers as authority figures. They give no value to praise provided by adults, or they have no respect for the individual who is giving praise.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Piaget&#x27;s works also inspired the transformation of European and American education, including theory and practice, leading to a more &#x27;child-centered&#x27; approach. In &quot;Conversations with Jean Piaget&quot;, Bringuier says: &quot;Education, for most people, means trying to lead the child to resemble the typical adult of his society ... but for me and no one else, education means making creators... You have to make inventors, innovators—not conformists&quot; (Bringuier, 1980, p. 132).

His theory of cognitive development can be used as a tool in the early childhood classroom. According to Piaget, children developed best in a classroom with interaction.

Piaget defined knowledge as the ability to modify, transform, and &quot;operate on&quot; an object or idea, such that it is understood by the operator through the process of transformation. Learning, then, occurs as a result of experience, both physical and logical, with the objects themselves and how they are acted upon. Thus, knowledge must be assimilated in an active process by a learner with matured mental capacity, so that knowledge can build in complexity by scaffolded understanding. Understanding is scaffolded by the learner through the process of equilibration, whereby the learner balances new knowledge with previous understanding, thereby compensating for &quot;transformation&quot; of knowledge.

Learning, then, can also be supported by instructors in an educational setting. Piaget specified that knowledge cannot truly be formed until the learner has matured the mental structures to which that learning is specific, and thereby development constrains learning. Nevertheless, knowledge can also be &quot;built&quot; by building on simpler operations and structures that have already been formed. Basing operations of an advanced structure on those of simpler structures thus scaffolds learning to build on operational abilities as they develop. Good teaching, then, is built around the operational abilities of the students such that they can excel in their operational stage and build on preexisting structures and abilities and thereby &quot;build&quot; learning.

Evidence of the effectiveness of a contemporary curricular design building on Piaget&#x27;s theories of developmental progression and the support of maturing mental structures can be seen in Griffin and Case&#x27;s &quot;Number Worlds&quot; curriculum. The curriculum works toward building a &quot;central conceptual structure&quot; of number sense in young children by building on five instructional processes, including aligning curriculum to the developmental sequencing of acquisition of specific skills. By outlining the developmental sequence of number sense, a conceptual structure is built and aligned to individual children as they develop.

The cognitive scientist Karen Fuson has argued that the impact of Piagetian theories in education has not been entirely positive because his work has frequently been misinterpreted. In particular, Piaget&#x27;s focus on children&#x27;s interactions with objects in the concrete operational stage has led to an approach to education in which young children are encouraged to learn mathematics by manipulating real objects, but without the necessary direct instruction from teachers that they need to understand what they are doing and to link their activities to symbolic mathematics. This has had a particularly negative impact on low-attaining children who need more support from a more knowledgeable other to make meaning and progress with their learning.

Psychologist Mark Seidenberg has criticised the field of Education Studies for placing too much emphasis on the works of Piaget, Lev Vygotsky and other historical psychologists while failing to keep up with the major advances in cognitive science in the decades since they were active. Meanwhile, a 2016 systematic review of education research showed that constructivist approaches to early childhood education inspired by Piaget and Vygotsky are less effective than comprehensive approaches that incorporate direct skills teaching.

=== Morality ===
Piaget believed in two basic principles relating to character education: that children develop moral ideas in stages and that children create their conceptions of the world. According to Piaget, &quot;the child is someone who constructs his own moral world view, who forms ideas about right and wrong, and fair and unfair, that are not the direct product of adult teaching and that are often maintained in the face of adult wishes to the contrary&quot; (Gallagher, 1978, p. 26). Piaget believed that children made moral judgments based on their own observations of the world.

Piaget&#x27;s theory of morality was radical when his book &quot;The Moral Judgment of the Child&quot; was published in 1932 for two reasons: his use of philosophical criteria to define morality (as universalizable, generalizable, and obligatory) and his rejection of equating cultural norms with moral norms. Piaget, drawing on Kantian theory, proposed that morality developed out of peer interaction and that it was autonomous from authority mandates. Peers, not parents, were a key source of moral concepts such as equality, reciprocity, and justice.

Piaget attributed different types of psychosocial processes to different forms of social relationships, introducing a fundamental distinction between different types of said relationships. Where there is constraint because one participant holds more power than the other the relationship is asymmetrical, and, importantly, the knowledge that can be acquired by the dominated participant takes on a fixed and inflexible form. Piaget refers to this process as one of social transmission, illustrating it through reference to the way in which the elders of a tribe initiate younger members into the patterns of beliefs and practices of the group. Similarly, where adults exercise a dominating influence over the growing child, it is through social transmission that children can acquire knowledge. By contrast, in cooperative relations, power is more evenly distributed between participants so that a more symmetrical relationship emerges. Under these conditions, authentic forms of intellectual exchange become possible; each partner has the freedom to project his or her own thoughts, consider the positions of others, and defend his or her own point of view. In such circumstances, where children&#x27;s thinking is not limited by a dominant influence, Piaget believed &quot;the reconstruction of knowledge&quot;, or favorable conditions for the emergence of constructive solutions to problems, exists. Here the knowledge that emerges is open, flexible and regulated by the logic of argument rather than being determined by an external authority.

In short, cooperative relations provide the arena for the emergence of operations, which for Piaget requires the absence of any constraining influence, and is most often illustrated by the relations that form between peers (for more on the importance of this distinction see Duveen &amp; Psaltis, 2008; Psaltis &amp; Duveen, 2006, 2007). This is thus how, according to Piaget, children learn &quot;moral judgement&quot; as opposed to &quot;cultural norms&quot; (or maybe ideological norms).

Piaget&#x27;s research on morality was highly influential in subsequent work on moral development, particularly in the case of Lawrence Kohlberg&#x27;s highly influential stage theory of moral development which dominated moral psychology research until the end of the twentieth century.

=== Historical studies of thought and cognition ===
Historical changes of thought have been modeled in Piagetian terms. Broadly speaking these models have mapped changes in morality, intellectual life and cognitive levels against historical changes (typically in the complexity of social systems).

Notable examples include:
*Michael Horace Barnes&#x27; study of the co-evolution of religious and scientific thinking
*Peter Damerow&#x27;s theory of prehistoric and archaic thought
*Kieran Egan&#x27;s stages of understanding
*James W. Fowler&#x27;s stages of faith development
*Suzi Gablik&#x27;s stages of art history
*Christopher Hallpike&#x27;s studies of changes in cognition and moral judgment in pre-historical, archaic and classical periods ... (Hallpike 1979, 2004)
*Lawrence Kohlberg&#x27;s stages of moral development
*Don Lepan&#x27;s theory of the origins of modern thought and drama
*Charles Radding&#x27;s theory of the medieval intellectual development
*Jürgen Habermas&#x27;s reworking of historical materialism.

=== Non-human development ===
Neo-Piagetian stages have been applied to the maximum stage attained by various animals. For example, spiders attain the circular sensory motor stage, coordinating actions and perceptions. Pigeons attain the sensory motor stage, forming concepts.

===Origins===
The origins of human intelligence have also been studied in Piagetian terms. Wynn (1979, 1981) analysed Acheulian and Oldowan tools in terms of the insight into spatial relationships required to create each kind. On a more general level, Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Birth of Reason&quot; (2005) suggests a large-scale model for the emergence of a Piagetian intelligence.

=== Primatology ===
Piaget&#x27;s models of cognition have also been applied outside the human sphere, and some primatologists assess the development and abilities of primates in terms of Piaget&#x27;s model.

=== Philosophy ===
Philosophers have used Piaget&#x27;s work. For example, the philosopher and social theorist Jürgen Habermas has incorporated Piaget into his work, most notably in &quot;The Theory of Communicative Action.&quot; The philosopher Thomas Kuhn credited Piaget&#x27;s work with helping him to understand the transition between modes of thought which characterized his theory of paradigm shifts. Yet, that said, it is also noted that the implications of his later work do indeed remain largely unexamined. Shortly before his death (September 1980), Piaget was involved in a debate about the relationships between innate and acquired features of language, at the Centre Royaumont pour une Science de l&#x27;Homme, where he discussed his point of view with the linguist Noam Chomsky as well as Hilary Putnam and Stephen Toulmin.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Piaget also had a considerable effect in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence. Seymour Papert used Piaget&#x27;s work while developing the Logo programming language. Alan Kay used Piaget&#x27;s theories as the basis for the Dynabook programming system concept, which was first discussed within the confines of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC). These discussions led to the development of the Alto prototype, which explored for the first time all the elements of the graphical user interface (GUI), and influenced the creation of user interfaces in the 1980s and beyond.

==Criticisms==

===Criticisms of Piaget&#x27;s methods===

Judged by today&#x27;s standards of psychological research, Piaget&#x27;s research methods can be considered problematic. One modern reviewer said many of his &quot;pioneering investigations would probably be rejected from most modern journals on methodological grounds of sample size, non-standard measurement, and lack of inter-rater reliability&quot;.

Piaget&#x27;s research relied on very small samples that were not randomly selected. His book &quot;The Origins of Intelligence in Children&quot; was based on the study of just his own three children. This means that it is difficult to generalize his findings to the broader population. He interacted closely with his research subjects and did not follow a set script, meaning that experimental conditions were not the same from participant to participant.

Other shortcomings of Piaget’s theory include overestimating an adolescent&#x27;s cognitive abilities, underestimating an infant’s, and overlooking how much cultural and social factors affect children’s thinking..

As Piaget worked in the era before widespread use of voice recording equipment, his data collection method was simply to make handwritten notes in the field, which he would analyse himself. This differs from the modern practice of using multiple coders to ensure test validity. Critics such as Linda Siegel have argued that his experiments did not adequately control for social context and the child&#x27;s understanding (or lack of understanding) of the language used in the test task, leading to mistaken conclusions about children&#x27;s lack of reasoning skills.

These methodological issues mean scientists trying to replicate Piaget&#x27;s experiments have found that small changes to his procedures lead to different results. For example, in his tests of object-permanence and conservation of number, the ages at which children pass the tests varies greatly based on small variations in the test procedure, challenging his theoretical interpretations of his test results.

===Criticisms of Piaget&#x27;s theoretical ideas===

Piaget&#x27;s theories have not gone without scrutiny. A figure whose ideas contradicted Piaget&#x27;s ideas was the Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky. Vygotsky stressed the importance of a child&#x27;s cultural background as an effect on the stages of development. Because different cultures stress different social interactions, this challenged Piaget&#x27;s theory that the hierarchy of learning development had to develop in succession. Vygotsky introduced the term Zone of proximal development as an overall task a child would have to develop that would be too difficult to develop alone.

Also, the so-called neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development maintained that Piaget&#x27;s theory does not do justice either to the underlying mechanisms of information processing that explain transition from stage to stage or individual differences in cognitive development. According to these theories, changes in information processing mechanisms, such as speed of processing and working memory, are responsible for ascension from stage to stage. Moreover, differences between individuals in these processes explain why some individuals develop faster than other individuals (Demetriou, 1998).

Over time, alternative theories of child development have been put forward, and empirical findings have done a lot to undermine Piaget&#x27;s theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during the first phase of the experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies&#x27; understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies&#x27; performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that other people have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This contradicts Piaget&#x27;s view that children are very egocentric at this age.

Modern cognitive science had undermined Piaget&#x27;s view that young children are unable to comprehend numbers as they are not able to work with abstract concepts in the sensorimotor stage. This Piagetian view has led many educators to believe that it is not appropriate to teach simple arithmetic to young children as it will not lead to real understanding. Experiments by Starkey et al. have shown that children have an understanding of abstract numbers from as young as 6 months old while more recent studies by Izard et al. have shown that even newborns can perceive abstract numbers. For a full discussion of this, see Stanislas Dehaene&#x27;s &quot;The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics&quot;.

Some supporters of Piaget counter that his critics&#x27; arguments depend on misreadings of Piaget&#x27;s theory. See also Brian Rotman&#x27;s &quot;Jean Piaget: Psychologist of the Real&quot;, an exposition and critique of Piaget&#x27;s ideas, and Jonathan Tudge and Barbara Rogoff&#x27;s &quot;Peer influences on cognitive development: Piagetian and Vygotskian perspectives&quot;.

<text>A ledger line or leger line is used in Western musical notation to notate pitches above or below the lines and spaces of the regular musical staff. A line slightly longer than the note head is drawn parallel to the staff, above or below, spaced at the same distance as the lines within the staff. 

The origin of the word is uncertain, but may have been borrowed attributively from the term for a horizontal timber in a scaffolding, lying parallel to the face of the building and supporting the putlogs. There is no basis to support the often-found claim that the word originates from the French &quot;léger&quot;, meaning &quot;light&quot; or &quot;slight&quot; . The Oxford online dictionary describes the origin of the &quot;leger&quot; spelling as a &quot;variant of ledger&quot; that first appeared in the 19th century .

Although ledger lines are found occasionally in manuscripts of plainchant and early polyphony, it was only in the early 16th century in keyboard music that their use became at all extensive . Even then, printers had an aversion to ledger lines which caused difficulties in setting type, wasting space on the page and causing a messy appearance. Vocal music employed a variety of different clefs to keep the range of the part on the staff as much as possible; in keyboard notation a common way of avoiding ledger lines was the use of open score on four staves with different clefs .

Except for woodwind players, who prefer ledger lines to &quot;8va&quot; notation because they associate fingerings with staff positions , notes that use at least four ledger lines make music more difficult to read. For easier readability, the composer would usually switch clefs or use the &quot;8va&quot; notation. Some transposing instruments, such as the piccolo, double bass, guitar, and the tenor voice, transpose at the octave to avoid ledger lines.

Notation of tuba, trombone, and euphonium parts always use ledger lines below the bass staff, and never the &quot;8va bassa&quot; notation .

Music for bass clef instruments, such as the cello, bassoon or trombone, use tenor clef for the high notes rather than the treble clef. Alto clef is used for the alto trombone, and for the tenor trombone parts in Russian repertoire. Bass trombone and tuba use the bass clef only.

A ledger line is also used to support a half rest or whole rest where there are multiple voices on one staff and such a rest is forced above or below the staff. (The rare double whole rest is suspended between two ledger lines in this situation.)

<text>Wollunqua, also written Wollunka or Wollunkua, is a snake-god of rain and fertility in Australian Aboriginal mythology of the Warramunga people of the Northern Territory of Australia, a variation of the &quot;Rainbow Serpent&quot; present in the mythology of many other Aboriginal Australian peoples. The snake, which emerged from a watering hole called Kadjinara in the Murchison Ranges, is said to be many miles long. When speaking of the Wollunqua snake in public, the name &quot;urkulu nappaurinnia&quot; is used, because if they were to call it too often by its real name they would lose control and it would come out and devour them all. It can place the rainbow in the sky at will.

Wollunqua is a totemic ancestor of the Warramunga people, specifically the Uluuru moiety of the tribe. Amongst the Warramunga tribe, the snake totems are of considerable importance, the great majority of individuals of the Uluuru moiety belonging either to the Wollunqua, Thalaualla (black snake), or Tjudia (deaf adder) totems; but at the same time the Wollunqua is undoubtedly the most important, and is regarded as the great father of all of the snakes.

Wollunqua originated at a certain spot in the Wingara time, and wandered about over the country. He started from the watering hole Kadjinara in the upper part of a rocky gorge in the Murchison Range, and travelled thence away out to the west. A different tradition says that he stood up and tried to go down into the earth so as to return to Thapauerlu, but could not do so until he reached a place called Ununtumurra, where at last he succeeded, and, diving down, travelled back underground to Thapauerlu, where he has lived ever since.

Setting out towards the east, he travelled at first underground, coming up at various spots where he performed ceremonies and left behind large numbers of spirit children, forming local totemic centres when he passed on. There are eleven spots which are especially associated with him in connection with his wanderings. The first is called Pitingari. Here, there is a water-hole where the old Wollunqua is reported to have come out of the earth and looked around. Still travelling on underground, the Wollunqua reached and halted at a place called Antipataringa. From Antipataringa the Wollunqua, still travelling underground, went on to Tjunguniari, and there he came out and walked about amongst the sand-hills, or rather, the head end of the body came out, for he was so long that although he had travelled very many miles away from his home at Kadjinara, his tail end still remained there. The last place on his wanderings, Ununtumurra, is especially important in the Wollonqua ceremonies.

<text>In the Australian Aboriginal mythology of the Yolngu, Wuluwaid (see also Wuluwait) is a rain god. He is a god from northern Arnhem Land (northern Australia) and is known to work with Bunbulama as a rainmaker. He is also recorded by Charles Mountford and Ainslie Roberts as a boatman who ferries the souls of the dead to Purelko, the aboriginal afterlife.

<text>The Wandjina, also written Wanjina and Wondjina and also known as Gulingi, are cloud and rain spirits from the Wanjina Wunggurr cultural bloc of Aboriginal Australians, depicted prominently in rock art in northwestern Australia. Some of the artwork in the Kimberley region of Western Australia dates back to approximately 4,000 years ago. Another closely related spirit entity is the creator being Wunngurr, a being analogous to the Rainbow Serpent in other Aboriginal peoples&#x27; belief systems, but with a different interpretation.

The stories of the Wandjina and the artwork depicting them remain important to the Mowanjum Community of Aboriginal people, and are one of the basic cultural elements of the Wanjina Wunggurr cultural bloc, which includes four Aboriginal peoples in the Kimberley.

==Dreamtime legends==
Some Dreamtime stories say the Wandjina created the landscape and its inhabitants, and continue to have influence over both. When the spirits found the place they would die, they painted their images on cave walls and entered a nearby waterhole. These paintings were then refreshed by Aboriginal people as a method of regenerating life force.

The Wandjina can punish those who break the law with floods, lightning and cyclones.

The Wandjina and Wunggurr spirits are essential elements of the life of the cultural bloc known as the Wanjina Wunggurr, consisting of the Worrorra (and neighbouring Ngardi), Wunambal and Ngarinyin peoples of the Kimberley. Rock paintings depicting Wanjina, as well as the Gwion Gwion (&quot;Bradshaw&quot;) paintings, are evidence of the shared culture. The Wunambal people in the Mitchell Plateau area refer to Wandjina as Gulingi.

Wunggurr is a variant on the Rainbow Serpent creator being belief, while the wandjina are local spirits, attached to places, and associated with particular clans. Although some local expressions use the two terms interchangeably, &quot;wungurr&quot; is a &quot;more diffuse life force animating and underlying the particular manifestations of its power that find expression in all species of things, including the wandjina&quot;. One facet of wungurr is embodied in a rock python known as Wanjad.

==Traditional rock artwork==
The broad-stroke artwork of the Wandjina rock art dates to around 3800–4000 years ago. The emergence of this art style follows the end of a millennium-long drought that gave way to a wetter climate characterised by regular monsoons.

The Wandjina paintings have common colours of black, red and yellow on a white background. The spirits are depicted alone or in groups, vertically or horizontally depending on the dimensions of the rock, and are sometimes depicted with figures and objects like the Rainbow Serpent or yams. Common composition is with large upper bodies and heads that may show eyes and nose, but typically no mouth. Two explanations have been given for this: they are so powerful they do not require speech and if they had mouths, the rain would never cease. Around the heads of Wandjina are lines or blocks of color, depicting lighting coming out of transparent helmets.

Today, the paintings are still believed to possess these powers and therefore are to be approached and treated respectfully. Each site and painting has a name. Indigenous people of the Mowanjum community repaint the images to ensure the continuity of the Wandjina&#x27;s presence. Annual repainting in December or January also ensures the arrival of the monsoon rains, according to Mowanjum belief.

Repainting has occurred so often that at one site the paint is over 40 layers deep. The painting style has evolved during this process: more recent figures are stockier and some now possess eyelashes.

==Depictions on bark==
In the late 1960s and early 1970s several Mowanjum artists depicted traditional Wandjina on pieces of string bark. These bark paintings were sold mainly through the mission at Kalumbaru. Some of the important artists from this region include Alec Mingelmanganu, Charlie Numbelmoore and Jack Karedada. These artworks are now in major museum collections around the world.

==Other depictions==
Wandjina were the inspiration for a 1966 children&#x27;s fantasy television series, &quot;Wandjina!&quot;, produced by ABC Television in 1966.

In 2007, graffiti depictions of Wandjina appeared in Perth, Western Australia. Styles ranged from stencil-work to a spray painted Wandjina driving a pink car. Using Flickr and blogs, several people engaged in &quot;Wandjina watching&quot;, documenting the Wandjina graffiti they found. These &quot;wandering Wandjina&quot; angered and upset some Indigenous people who said that only certain artists from their people are permitted to depict the Wandjina, without saying who these people are. A short film, &quot;Who Paintin&#x27; Dis Wandjina&quot;, discussed the Aboriginal reaction.

Images of the Wandjina are displayed on the walls of the Ringwood Magistrates Court in Victoria; these are referenced as produced the National Gallery of Victoria. 

In 2016, during the Vivid Sydney festival, artwork of Wandjina by artist Donny Woolagoodja was projected onto the Sydney Opera House as part of its Lighting of the Sails celebration.

In 2023, Wandjina was added to the popular mobile game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, initially as an antagonist and later as a playable character.

<doc id="95279" wikidata="Q6791996" url="?curid=95279" title="Maturationism">
<text>Maturationism is an early childhood educational philosophy that sees the child as a growing organism and believes that the role of education is to passively support this growth rather than actively fill the child with information. This theory suggests that growth and development unfold from within the organism. It is also based on the idea that a learner&#x27;s development is governed by a biologically based schedule.

== Theory ==
In maturationism, genetic factors play a larger role in development than environmental ones, particularly in regard to language acquisition. Here, the effect of genetic inheritance to development has more bearing than the impact of nurture, experience, and learning. It is believed that an innate maturational schedule drives what a child will do and at what time.

Maturationism is associated with the concept of developmental stages. Maturation theorists maintain that the universal and invariant sequence of human development can be described and that the genetic makeup of an individual determines the pace of such development. It is often associated with the work of Arnold Gesell who, along with his colleagues at the Clinic of Child Development at Yale University, charted the development of thousands of children and described developmental milestones that were achieved in a developmental sequence.

== Maturation programs ==
Learning programs based on the maturationist perspective usually focus on certain tenets of psychodynamic theories of development and progressive educational philosophy. These draw, for instance, from the work of Sigmund Freud as reflected in their emphasis on early experience for subsequent emotional, social, and cognitive development. The objectives are also stated in global, qualitative terms and often associated to the development of competency and self-esteem, factors that are considered crucial in cognitive and social development.

<text>Rasmus Bartholin (; Latinized: &quot;Erasmus Bartholinus&quot;; 13 August 1625 – 4 November 1698) was a Danish physician and grammarian.

==Biography==
Bartholin was born in Roskilde. He was the son of Caspar Bartholin the Elder (1585–1629) and Anna Fincke, daughter of the mathematician Thomas Fincke.

As part of his studies, he travelled in Europe for ten years. He stayed in the Netherlands, England, France and Italy. In 1647, he took a Master&#x27;s degree at the University of Copenhagen. In 1654, he received a Doctoral degree at the University of Padua.

He was a professor at the University of Copenhagen, first in Geometry, later in Medicine. He was also dean of the faculty of medicine, librarian, and rector. He wrote, in Latin, the first grammar of the Danish language, the 1657 &quot;De studio lingvæ danicæ&quot;.

Rasmus Bartholin is remembered especially for his discovery (1669) of the double refraction of a light ray by Iceland spar (calcite). He published an accurate description of the phenomenon, but since the physical nature of light was poorly understood at the time, he was unable to explain it. It was only after Thomas Young proposed the wave theory of light, c. 1801 that an explanation became possible.

==Personal==
He was a younger brother of Thomas Bartholin (1616–1680).

<doc id="95283" wikidata="Q2306159" url="?curid=95283" title="Polynesian mythology">
<text>Polynesian mythology encompasses the oral traditions of the people of Polynesia (a grouping of Central and South Pacific Ocean island archipelagos in the Polynesian Triangle) together with those of the scattered cultures known as the Polynesian outliers. Polynesians speak languages that descend from a language reconstructed as Proto-Polynesian – probably spoken in the Tonga and Samoa area around 1000 BC.

==Description==

Prior to the 15th century AD, Polynesian peoples fanned out to the east, to the Cook Islands, and from there to other groups such as Tahiti and the Marquesas. Their descendants later discovered the islands from Tahiti to Rapa Nui, and later Hawai‘i and New Zealand. The latest research puts the settlement of New Zealand at about 1300 AD. The various Polynesian languages are all part of the Austronesian language family. Many are close enough in terms of vocabulary and grammar to permit communication between speakers of different languages. There are also substantial cultural similarities between the various groups, especially in terms of social organization, childrearing, horticulture, building and textile technologies; their mythologies, in particular, demonstrate local reworkings of commonly shared tales.

In some island groups, Tangaroa is of great importance as the god of the sea and of fishing. There is often a story of the marriage between Sky and Earth; the New Zealand version, Rangi and Papa, is a union that gives birth to the world and all things in it. There are stories of islands pulled up from the bottom of the sea by a magic fishhook or thrown down from heaven. There are stories of voyages, migrations, seductions and battles, as one might expect. Stories about a trickster, Māui and demon Ulupoka are widely known, as are those about a beautiful goddess/ancestress Hina or Sina.

In addition to these shared themes in the oral tradition, each island group has its own stories of demi-gods and culture heroes, shading gradually into the firmer outlines of remembered history. Often such stories were linked to various geographic or ecological features, which may be described as the petrified remains of supernatural beings.

==From verbal to written==
The various Polynesian cultures each have distinct but related oral traditions, that is, legends or myths traditionally considered to recount the history of ancient times (the time of &quot;pō&quot;) and the adventures of gods (&quot;atua&quot;) and deified ancestors. The accounts are characterised by extensive use of allegory, metaphor, parable, hyperbole, and personification. Orality has an essential flexibility that writing does not allow. In an oral tradition, there is no fixed version of a given tale. The story may change within certain limits according to the setting, and the needs of the narrator and the audience. Contrary to the modern scholarly concept of history, where the knowledge of the past serves to bring a better understanding of the present, the purpose of oral literature is rather to justify and legitimatise the present situation. 

An example is provided by genealogies, which exist in multiple and often contradictory versions. The purpose of genealogies in oral societies generally is not to provide a &#x27;true&#x27; account, but rather to emphasise the seniority of the ruling chiefly line, and hence its political legitimacy and right to exploit resources of land and the like. If another line should rise to ascendency, it was necessary to bestow upon the new line the most prestigious genealogy, even if this meant borrowing a few ancestors from the preceding dynasty. Each island, each tribe or each clan will have their own version or interpretation of a given narrative cycle. 

This process is disrupted when writing becomes the primary means to record and remember the traditions. When missionaries, officials, anthropologists or ethnologists collected and published these accounts, they inevitably changed their nature. By fixing forever on paper what had previously been subject to almost infinite variation, they fixed as the authoritative version an account told by one narrator at a given moment. In New Zealand, the writings of one chief, Wiremu Te Rangikāheke, formed the basis of much of Governor George Grey&#x27;s &quot;Polynesian Mythology&quot;, a book which to this day provides the de facto official versions of many of the best-known Māori legends. 

Some Polynesians seem to have been aware of the danger and the potential of this new means of expression. As of the mid-19th century, a number of them wrote down their genealogy, the history and the origin of their tribe. These writings, known under the name of &quot;pukapuka whakapapa&quot; (genealogy books, Māori) or in tropical Polynesia as &quot;puta tumu&quot; (origin stories) or &quot;puta tūpuna&quot; (ancestral stories) were jealously guarded by the heads of households. Many disappeared or were destroyed. In the 1890s, Makea Takau, a Rarotongan chief, ordered his tribe to burn all their family books, save his own. As a result, Makea Takau&#x27;s version became the official history of the chiefly line, removing the possibility of dissent. At his request, extracts were published in the &quot;Journal of the Polynesian Society&quot;.

<text>Erik Waller (1875–1955) was a Swedish surgeon and book collector.

Waller collected some 20,000 important books on science and medicine, including 150 incunabula and other early editions, including a first edition of Andreas Vesalius&#x27;s &quot;De Humani Corporis Fabrica Libri Septem&quot;. In his last will and testament he left the whole collection to Uppsala University and its library. A catalogue of the collection was with the greatest competence and care compiled by Hans Sallander and published in two volumes, Uppsala 1955. It includes some fifty plates, reproducing selected interesting items from the collection. Waller&#x27;s collection of medals relating to the history of medicine is housed by the Uppsala University Coin Cabinet.

<text>Māui or Maui is the great culture hero and trickster in Polynesian mythology. Very rarely was Māui actually worshipped, being less of a deity (demigod) and more of a folk hero. His origins vary from culture to culture, but many of his main exploits remain relatively similar.

Tales of Māui&#x27;s exploits and adventures are told throughout most of Polynesia; they can be traced back as far west as islands off New Guinea. Some exploits common to most Polynesian traditions are stealing fire for humans from the underworld, fishing up islands with his magical hook, and capturing the Sun to lengthen the days. There is a great deal of variation in the representations of Māui from nation to nation, from being a handsome young man, to being an old wise wandering priest. Although Māui was said to be very rascally or &quot;kolohe&quot;, many of his deeds were to better the lives of his fellow people.

== Māori mythology ==

In Māori mythology, as in other Polynesian traditions, Māui is a culture hero and a trickster, famous for his exploits and cleverness. Māori names of Māui include &quot;Māui-tikitiki&quot; (&quot;Māui the top-knot&quot;), &quot;Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga&quot; (&quot;Māui the top-knot of Taranga&quot;), &quot;Māui-pōtiki&quot; (&quot;Māui the last born&quot;), and &quot;Māui te whare kino&quot; (&quot;Māui the house of trouble&quot;).

=== Islands of New Zealand ===
Māui&#x27;s older brothers always refused to let him come fishing with them. One night, he wove for himself a flax fishing line and enchanted it with a karakia to give it strength; to this he attached the magic fish-hook made from the jawbone that his grandmother Murirangawhenua had given him. Then he stowed away in the hull of his brothers&#x27; waka (canoe). The next morning, when the waka was too far from land to return, he emerged from his hiding place. His brothers would not lend him any bait, so he struck himself on the nose and baited the hook with his blood. He pulled up a giant fish which would become the North Island of New Zealand, known as &quot;Te Ika-a-Māui&quot;; the valleys and mountains of the island were made by his brothers chopping up the fish for themselves. In some traditions his waka became the South Island, known as &quot;Te Waka a Māui&quot;. (Other traditions make the South Island the waka of Aoraki.)

=== Māui brings fire to the world ===
Māui wanted to know where fire came from, so one night he went among the villages of his people and put all the fires out. Māui&#x27;s mother Taranga, who was their rangatira, said that someone would have to ask Mahuika, the goddess of fire, for more. So Māui (a grandson of Mahuika) offered to go and find her. Mahuika lived in a cave in a burning mountain at the end of the earth. She gave Māui one of her burning fingernails to relight the fires, but Māui extinguished fingernail after fingernail until Mahuika became angry and sent fire to pursue Māui, who survived only by calling upon Tāwhirimātea, the god of weather, to put it out with his rain. Mahuika threw her last nail at Māui, but it missed him and flew into some trees including the māhoe and the kaikōmako. Māui brought back dry sticks of these trees to his village and showed his people how to rub the sticks together and make fire.

=== Māui slows the sun ===
In former days, the sun used to travel quickly across the sky, leaving not enough daylight time for working and eating. Māui proposed to catch the sun and slow it down. Armed with Murirangawhenua&#x27;s magic jawbone and a large amount of rope, Māui and his brothers journeyed to the east and found the pit where the sun-god Tama-nui-te-rā slept during the night-time. There they tied the ropes into a noose around the pit and built a wall of clay to shelter behind. Tama-nui-te-rā was caught in the noose and Māui struck him with the jawbone until he surrendered and agreed to travel slowly across the sky.

=== The death of Māui ===
Māui&#x27;s last trick led to his death and involved Hine-nui-te-pō, the goddess of death and the underworld. In an attempt to make mankind immortal by reversing the natural birth process, he transformed into a worm and entered Hine-nui-te-pō&#x27;s vagina, intending to leave through her mouth while she slept. However, she was awoken by (fantails) who had burst into laughter at the sight of Māui entering her vagina. Angered, Hine-nui-te-pō crushed Māui to death with the obsidian teeth in her vagina. The story now serves as a cautionary tale against rape.

== Hawaiian mythology ==

In Hawaiian religion, Māui is a culture hero and ancient chief who appears in several different genealogies. In the Kumulipo he is the son of ʻAkalana and his wife Hina-a-ke-ahi (Hina). This couple has four sons, Māui-mua, Māui-waena, Māui-kiʻikiʻi and Māui-a-kalana. Māui-a-kalana&#x27;s wife is named Hinakealohaila; his son is Nanamaoa. Māui is one of the Kupua. His name is the same as that of the Hawaiian island Maui, although native tradition holds that it is not named for him directly, but instead named after the son of the &quot;Hawaiʻiloa&quot; (&quot;discoverer of Hawaiʻi&quot;, who was named after Māui himself).

=== Revelator of Birds ===
Some of Māui&#x27;s most renowned feats included causing birds (which were invisible to mortal eyes) to become visible. In this long ago, forgotten time, the music of the birds delighted Māui. He observed them with keen interest, their varied and beautiful plumage which adorned the foliage of fragrant trees, and their melodious music, however, no one else could join him in enjoying what was apparent to his vision. For, although Māui&#x27;s friends could hear their wonderful bird songs, none perceived the true source of the sounds. Māui felt compassion for his friends, for humanity, and their inability to behold with their eyes the colorful, musical creatures as they flitted from tree to tree, so, Māui caused the creatures to become visible to the naked eye.

=== Creation of Hawai&#x27;i ===
Māui also is credited with the creation of the Hawaiian islands, when he went on a fishing expedition with his friends, and, using a magic fish hook, pulled up various island groups from the oceanic depths. In some versions of the Hawaiian fisherman story, Māui is said to be a bad fisherman. His brothers would mock him for not catching any fish and he would retaliate with mischievous tricks against them. Māui and all his brothers were sons to a divine father and mother but only Māui was granted miraculous powers, which is why Māui was able to possess this magical hook made from the bones of his divine ancestors. One day, his brothers went fishing but would not permit Māui to join them on the canoe, and this irritated Māui. When they returned, Māui told them that, had he gone with them, they would have caught many more fish rather than just a single shark. His brothers considered his remark and then took him out on their next trip. They asked him where all the &quot;good&quot; fish were. Māui then threw in his magical hook baited with Alae birds, sacred to his mother Hina. The ocean floor began to move and generate huge waves while Māui asked his brothers to paddle fast to accommodate for the oncoming fish. They paddled with great power and were getting tired but Māui told them not to look back because if they did the fish would run away. One of the brothers disobeyed and the fishing line snapped, revealing new islands. Had nobody looked back, there would have been more islands.

=== The secret of fire ===
As humans had not yet discovered fire, during Māui&#x27;s tenure in a land of perpetual volcanic eruptions and fire in the mountaintops, Māui decided that rather than periodically hike for dozens of miles across corals just to obtain glowing embers of the extinguished fires put out the previous night by cold winds, he decided upon a simpler solution. He would bring the fire to him. Māui knew of a tribe of intelligent birds that mastered the art of fire-making. His plan was to capture their leader, and coerce from him the secret of fire. The bird taught him that he should rub certain sticks together in order to produce fire, and this is how the secret of fire was brought to humanity.

=== Tamer of the Sun and the Heavens ===
Before Māui&#x27;s involvement in the matter, the Sun (Lā) notoriously traveled on irregular paths in the sky, coming and going unexpectedly at times, which made activities such as farming very difficult for man. To this end, Māui crafted snares made of his hair in order to trap the sun and compel it to travel more slowly and adhere to regular courses of travel. In this manner, Māui regulated the sun&#x27;s activities for the benefit of mankind.

=== Pillar of the Sky ===
Similar to Atlas and Heracles of Greek mythology, Māui lifted up the heavens, which, for a long time, had lain heavily upon the plants of the Earth, leaving insufficient room for growth and for humanity to move about with ease.

==Tongan mythology==
In the Tongan version of his tales, Māui drew up the Tongan Islands from the deep: first appeared Lofanga and the other Haʻapai Islands, and finally Vavau. Māui then dwelt in Tonga. Māui had two sons: the eldest, Māui-Atalanga, and the younger Māui-Kisikisi. The latter discovered the secret of fire, and taught people the art of cooking food: he made fire dwell in certain kinds of wood. Māui-Motu&#x27;a bears the earth on his shoulders, and when he nods in sleep it causes earthquakes, therefore the people have to stamp on the ground to awaken him. Hikule&#x27;o, the deity presiding over Pulotu, the underworld, is the youngest son of Māui-Motu&#x27;a. Houma is pointed out as the spot where Māui&#x27;s fish hook caught.

Other sources say that in Tonga there were three Māui brothers: Māui-motua (old Māui), Māui-Atalanga, and Māui-Kisikisi (dragonfly Māui), the last one being the trickster. He also got the name Māui-fusi-fonua (Māui land puller) when he begged for the magic fishhook from the old fisherman Tongafusifonua, who lived in Manuka (located to the east on the island of Tonga). Tongafusifonua allowed him to take the fishhook, under the condition that he could find it in his collection of countless hooks. But his wife, Tavatava, betrayed the secret, allowing Māui to pick the right hook. And so he was able to fish up the coral islands from the bottom of the ocean (Volcanic islands are supposed to have fallen from the heavens).

==Tahitian mythology==
In the mythology of Tahiti, Māui was a wise man, or prophet. He was a priest, but was afterwards deified. Being at one time engaged at the marae (sacred place), and the sun getting low while Māui&#x27;s work was unfinished, he laid hold of the hihi, or sun-rays, and stopped his course for some time. As the discoverer of fire, Māui was named &quot;Ao-ao-ma-ra&#x27;i-a&quot; because he taught the art of obtaining fire by friction of wood. Before this time people ate their food raw. See also Mahui&#x27;e, Tahitian guardian of fire.

Māui was responsible for earthquakes.

== Samoan mythology ==

In Samoan mythology, Māui or Tiʻitiʻi gave fire to his people. Being the curious and &quot;kolohe&quot; demigod that he is, Tiʻitiʻi concealed himself closely to a wall that allowed his father, Talaga, to get to work in the underworld. The underworld is home to Mafuiʻe, the earthquake god. When Tiʻitiʻi got the chance, he went up to the wall and imitated the voice of his father, saying &quot;O rock! Divide, I am Talaga, I come to work on my land given by Mafuiʻe&quot;. As Tiʻitiʻi passed through to the underworld, his father was surprised and told his son to help quietly so he doesn&#x27;t anger Mafui‘e. While working, Tiʻitiʻi noticed smoke and asked his father where it was coming from. Talaga explained that the smoke was from Mafuiʻes fire. Tiʻitiʻi went to see the god and ask for fire. Mafuiʻe gave him a little bit of the fire; then he quickly built a stone oven, or &quot;umu&quot;, to put it in. His idea was to cook the taro that they had been harvesting. The god came and blew the fire up scattering the rocks and angered Tiʻitiʻi. As he goes to talk to the god, Mafui‘e was determined to punish Tiʻitiʻi severely for daring to rebel against the power of fire. Their great duel ultimately ended with Tiʻitiʻi triumphant. The young demigod broke off Mafuiʻe&#x27;s right arm and caught the left arm right after. Scared that Tiʻitiʻi was going to break off that arm, Mafuiʻe pleaded with him to spare the left arm so he could still fulfill his duty of keeping Samoa flat with earthquakes. The god offered him one hundred wives should he spare his left arm. The hero declined; the god offered the secrets of fire that he can take to the upper world. Tiʻitiʻi accepted this offer and learned that the gods had hidden eternal fire in trees, to be extracted by rubbing sticks from the trees together.

==Mangarevan mythology==

In the mythology of Mangareva, Māui hauls the land up from the sea, and ties the sun with tresses of hair. His father was Ataraga; his mother, Uaega.

There were eight Māui: Māui-mua, Māui-muri, Māui-toere-mataroa, Tumei-hauhia, Māui-tikitiki-toga, Māui-matavaru, Māui-taha, Māui-roto. Māui the eight-eyed (matavaru) is the hero. He is born from his mother&#x27;s navel, and is raised by his grandfather, Te Rupe, who gives him a magic staff named &quot;Atua-tane&quot; and a hatchet named &quot;Iraiapatapata&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Maui appears in the 2016 Disney 3D computer-animated musical film &quot;Moana&quot; and its 2024 sequel &quot;Moana 2&quot;, in which he is voiced by Dwayne Johnson. Abandoned by his human parents as a baby, the gods took pity on him and made him a demigod and gave him a magic fishhook that gives him the ability to shape-shift. He went on to perform miracles to win back the love of humanity, each of which earned him an animated tattoo. He is fabled to have stolen the heart of Te Fiti, a powerful island goddess who creates life. The protagonist of the film, Moana, persuades him to help her return it. In his song &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome,&quot; composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Maui mentions and takes credit for several of the deeds he is credited with in folklore. This version of Māui incorporates elements from various Polynesian narratives.

<text>Hina is the name assigned to a number of Polynesian deities. The name Hina usually relates to a powerful female force (typically a goddess or queen) who has dominion over a specific entity. Some variations of the name Hina include Sina, Hanaiakamalama, and Ina. Even within a single culture, Hina could refer to multiple goddesses and the distinction between the different identities are not always clear. In Hawaiian mythology, the name is usually paired with words which explain or identify the goddess and her power such as Hina-puku-iʻa (Hina-gathering-seafood) the goddess of fishermen, and Hina-ʻopu-hala-koʻa who gave birth to all reef life.

Hina continues to be a figure in many of the Polynesian religions and her stories serve as traditions that unite Polynesia, specifically the Hawaiian Islands.

==New Zealand==
Among the of New Zealand, Hina is usually considered to be either the elder sister or the wife of Māui.

The most common story that presents Hina as the wife of Māui tells of Te Tunaroa, the father of all eels, who one day visited the pool where Hina bathed. One day, as Hina was bathing, the eel-god rubbed against her. This occurred over a number of visits until Te Tunaroa grew bold enough to rub against Hina&#x27;s genitals, molesting her.

When Māui heard of this act he went and attacked Te Tunaroa cutting his body into bits, the tail landed in the sea and became the conger eel, whereas the other end landed in the swamps as the fresh water eels. Smaller pieces became lamprey and hagfish.

A number of stories are told about Hina as the elder sister of Māui. Some say that it was Hina who taught Māui to plait the ropes needed to capture the sun, using a strand of her own sacred hair to give the ropes supernatural strength. This legend recognizes important ritual status that elder sisters held in traditional Māori society.

Hina was associated with phases of the moon under the names (Fair Hina) and (Dark Hina). The moon is also known by the name . 
Initially Hinatea (Fair Hina) was married to a man named Irawaru. During a fishing trip Irawaru antagonized Māui who had failed to catch any large fish. In revenge Māui assaulted Irawaru when they returned to shore, pushing his brother-in-law under the keel of their canoe, breaking his back and other bones. Irawaru was turned into a dog (kurī) one breed of which was known as .

When Hina heard what Māui had done she threw herself into the sea, but did not die and was instead carried across the waves to Motutapu (Sacred Isle). Her name was changed to due to her darker mood. Eventually Hinauri would be welcomed by the people of Motutapu and was taken to the house of Chief Tinirau god of fishes, becoming his new wife. The existing wives were jealous and tried to assault Hinauri, but using her supernatural power Hinauri killed the other wives of Tinirau and so became the senior wife.

Hina was the mother of Tuhuruhuru, for whom the ritual initiation ritual was performed by the Kae. After this is done, Tinirau lends Kae his pet whale to take him home. In spite of strict instructions to the contrary, Kae forces the whale, Tutunui, into shallow water, where it becomes stranded and is killed, roasted and eaten by Kae and his people. When he learns of this Tinirau is furious and sends Hinauri with a party of women (often they are Tinirau&#x27;s sisters) to capture Kae. The sisters perform indecent dances to make him laugh so they can see his crooked teeth. Then the women sing a magic song which puts Kae into a deep sleep, and carry him back to Motutapu. When Kae wakes from his sleep he is in Tinirau&#x27;s house. Tinirau taunts him for his treachery, and kills him (Grey 1970:69, Tregear 1891:110).

==Mangaia==
A girl named Hina-moe-aitu (&quot;Hina-sleeping-with-a-god&quot;) liked to bathe in a pool that housed many eels. One day, as Hina was bathing, one of the eels transformed into a young man. Hina took him as her lover. His name was Tuna.

After they had been together for a while, one day Tuna told Hina that there would be a great downpour the next day. He would be washed up onto the threshold of her house in his eel-form. When that happened, Tuna said, Hina must cut off his head and bury it, and then regularly visit the place where the head had been buried.

Hina obeyed Tuna, returning faithfully to watch the place where she had buried his head. After many days, she saw a shoot sprout from the spot. Another shoot appeared, and the two shoots grew into a pair of coconut trees—the first coconut trees known to man.

In Mangaian tradition, the coconut&#x27;s white flesh is called &quot;Tuna’s brains&quot;, and it is said that one can see a face when one looks at the shell of a coconut.

==Tuamotu and Tahiti==
For a time, the goddess Hina lived as the wife of Te Tuna, the god of eels. But she grew tired of him and decided to seek love elsewhere. Telling Tuna that she was going to get him some delicious food, Hina left him and went onto land.

Hina went from place to place, seeking a lover. But all the men she met were afraid to take Tuna&#x27;s wife, fearing the eel-god&#x27;s vengeance. Finally she met Māui, whose mother Taranga urged him to take the goddess as his wife.

When the people round about learned that Māui had taken Hina as his wife, they went to tell Tuna. At first, Tuna didn&#x27;t care, but the people annoyed him about it so much that he eventually vowed to win back his wife from Māui.

Along with four companions, Tuna rushed toward Māui&#x27;s home, carried by a huge wave. But Māui&#x27;s power turned back the wave and left Tuna and his companions beached on the reefs. Māui killed three of Tuna&#x27;s companions, while one escaped with a broken leg. Tuna himself Māui spared.

Tuna actually lived in peace in Māui&#x27;s home for some time. But one day, Tuna challenged Māui to a duel. Each would take a turn leaping into the others’ body and trying to kill him. If Tuna killed Māui, then Tuna would take his wife back. Tuna&#x27;s turn came first: he made himself small and entered Māui&#x27;s body. When he came back out, Māui was intact. Now it was Māui&#x27;s turn: Māui made himself small and entered Tuna&#x27;s body, tearing it apart. Māui cut off Tuna&#x27;s head and, at his mother&#x27;s suggestion, buried it in a corner of his house.

In time, a shoot sprouted from Tuna&#x27;s buried head and grew into a coconut tree. That was how humankind acquired coconuts.

==Hawaii==
Even within Hawaiian mythology, Hina could refer to multiple different goddesses. Differentiating between these deities can be ambiguous and is highly debated. However, there are three specific Hawaiian deities named Hina who are widely known and can be distinguished from each other. Hina of Hilo is best known as the mother of Hawaiian hero, Māui. Hina, the wife of Akalana, is known as the goddess of the moon. &quot;Mahina&quot;, the Hawaiian word for moon, is derived from the goddess&#x27; name. Lady Hina-au-kekele was also named after Hina, and the full name of Lady Hineuki was Hinakeʻuki. The consorts of Hina include Chief ʻAikanaka, Sky Father Wākea and/or Akalana with whom she gave birth to several children including Māui.

The worship of Hina marks a long tradition of the Hawaiian people across multiple islands. Archaeologists have discovered remnants of a heiau dedicated to Hina in Kalaupapa National Historical Park, on the Hawaiian Island of Moloka&#x27;i. In some of the Hawaiian legends, the goddess lived on Kauiki, a foothill of the dormant volcano Haleakalā on the southeast coast of the Island Maui. Another claim suggests Hina&#x27;s legends were brought to the Hilo coast with ancient immigrants but the stories are so old that the Hawaiians have forgotten her original lands and see Hilo as her only home.

William Drake Westervelt described the legend: 

=== Legends of Hina and Māui ===
Many stories about the goddess Hina, especially in connection with the moon, can be found in chapter 15 (“Hina Myths”) of Martha Beckwith’s &quot;Hawaiian Mythology&quot;.

The legendary birth of Hina&#x27;s son, Māui, is described as a supernatural conception after Hina wore a red loincloth she found on the ocean shore. After birth, Hina wrapped locks of her hair around her infant son and set him on a bed of limu kala supported by jellyfish in the sea. Māui then traveled to Kuaihelani where he acquired his famous powers. Legend says when he returned, Māui performed incredible acts such as slowing the sun to make the days longer for Hina&#x27;s work.

The story of Hina and her ascent to the moon can be found within the stories of many Polynesian groups, including those of Samoa, New Zealand, Tonga, Hervey Islands, Fate Islands, Nauru, and other Pacific Island groups such as the Maluku Islands in Melanesia. There is debate over which Hina the story refers to but certain stories suggest this legend is about Hina the wife of a chief called Aikanaka rather than to Hina the wife of Akalana, the father of Māui.

==Samoa==
In Samoa, the equivalent the name &quot;Sina&quot; referred to in many different stories in mythology. One example is the legend Sina and the Eel which is associated with the Mata o le Alelo pool on the island of Savai&#x27;i.

== Easter Island (Rapa Nui) ==
In Rapa Nui mythology, Hina takes the form of Hina-Oio, a goddess of sea animals who was married to Atua-Metua.

==Hina in literature==
Richard Adams wrote a poem retelling the Tahitian story of Hina and Māui, published as a book, &quot;The Legend of Te Tuna&quot;.

Also, in his popular book &quot;The Seven Daughters of Eve&quot;, Bryan Sykes used Hina&#x27;s name, (spelled therein &quot;Ina&quot;) to denote the clan matriarch of mtDNA haplogroup B.

==Hina in popular music==
David Lee Roth recorded a song called &quot;Hina&quot;, contained on the 1988 hard rock album &quot;Skyscraper&quot;.

Technical death metal band Gorod included a song called &quot;Hina&quot; on their 2018 album &quot;Æthra&quot;.

<doc id="95295" wikidata="Q3431110" url="?curid=95295" title="America's Great Depression">
<text>America&#x27;s Great Depression is a 1963 treatise on the 1930s Great Depression and its root causes, written by Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard. 

The book blames government policy failures for the Great Depression, and challenges the widely-held view that capitalism is unstable. 

==Summary==
Rothbard argues that it was the interventionist policies of the Herbert Hoover administration which magnified the duration, breadth, and intensity of the Great Depression. Rothbard explains the Austrian theory of the business cycle, which holds that government manipulation of the money supply sets the stage for the familiar &quot;boom-bust&quot; phases of the modern market. He then details the inflationary policies of the Federal Reserve from 1921 to 1929 as evidence that the depression was essentially caused not by speculation, but by government and central bank interference in the market.

<doc id="95303" wikidata="Q1423283" url="?curid=95303" title="Rongo">
<text>In Māori mythology, Rongo or Rongo-mā-Tāne (also Rongo-hīrea, Rongo-marae-roa, and Rongo-marae-roa-a-Rangi) is a major god (&quot;atua&quot;) of cultivated plants, especially kumara (spelled &quot;kūmara&quot; in Māori), a vital crop. Other crops cultivated by Māori in traditional times included taro, yams (&quot;uwhi&quot;), cordyline (&quot;tī&quot;), and gourds (&quot;hue&quot;). Because of their tropical origin, most of these crops were difficult to grow except in the far north of the North Island, hence the importance of Rongo in New Zealand.

He was also an important god of agriculture and god of war in the southern Cook Islands, especially on Mangaia where the Akaoro marae and Orongo marae were centres of his worship; where cooked taro was offered to him to assure success in battle and the fertility of land.

A legend concerning Rongo flying the first kite is told in the waiting room of Walt Disney&#x27;s Enchanted Tiki Room, in which Rongo is voiced by Ernest Tavares.

==Separation of the primordial parents==
In the creation story of the tribes of the Arawa canoe, Rongo, with his brothers Tū, Tāne, Tangaroa, and Haumia-tiketike, agreed that the primordial parents Rangi and Papa needed to be separated to allow daylight into the world. A sixth brother, Tāwhirimātea, the god of storms, did not consent to this and afterwards attacked his brothers with unrelenting fury. Rongo and Haumia, the god of wild food, took refuge in the body of Papa, mother earth, who hid them until the storm passed (Grey 1956:7, Tregear 1891:424, Orbell 1998:121).

==Kūmara==

He would have had more of an association with the small, yellow-skin, finger-sized variety known as &quot;hutihuti&quot;, &quot;rekamaroa&quot;, and &quot;taputini&quot;, which the Māori had brought with them from eastern Polynesia, rather than larger varieties brought by later sealers, traders, and whalers in the early 19th century.

In the Māori language, &quot;rongo&quot; can mean &#x27;peace&#x27; (after war). Rongo is generally portrayed as the creator of the kūmara, a plant associated with peace; probably because the intense cultivation it needed was best performed in times of peace.

In Ngāti Awa traditions, Rongo is a son of Tāne and father of the kūmara, but a man named Rongo-māui travels to Whānui, from whom he steals the kūmara and returns to Earth with it.

Small statues representing Rongo were once placed alongside kūmara fields.

==Rongo in the Cook Islands==
In southern Cook Islands mythology, Rongo was the god of agriculture and one of the children of Vatea (sky father) and Papa (earth mother). His twin brother was Tangaroa, the god of the sea. Rongo was the principal deity of Mangaia.

In the Mangaian legend of origin, Rongo&#x27;s sons by his wife Tavake (his daughter by his wife Te-po-tatango), Rangi, Mokoiro, and Akatauira, lifted the island of Mangaia up out of the underworld, becoming the first settlers and the ancestors of the Nga Ariki tribe, with Rangi becoming the first chief. The traditional name of the island was &quot;A&#x27;u A&#x27;u&quot;, which literally means &#x27;terraced&#x27;, short for &quot;A&#x27;u A&#x27;u Nui o Rongo ki te Ao Marama&quot; (&#x27;Great Terraced Land of Rongo in the Land of Daylight&#x27;).
In Mangaian society, the ritual system to become the principal chief, &quot;Te Mangaia&quot;, emphasized the worship of Rongo. The installation of a new &quot;Te Mangaia&quot; after a war of conquest of the &quot;puna&quot; lands required a human sacrifice to Rongo. He was both the god of war and god of taro irrigation; his regular peacetime offerings were parcels of cooked taro. The ideological linkages between Rongo, war, taro, and human sacrifice were complex: Rongo assured success in war and fertility of the land, but these required continual sacrifices in both human bodies and taro in an endless cycle. He would feast on the souls of those who died in battle.

Principal places of Rongo&#x27;s Mangaian worship were at two &quot;marae&quot; in the Keia district; the inland Akaoro marae, and the coastal Orongo marae, which was arguably the most important of all &quot;marae&quot; on the island, and constructed at the site of an abandoned village of the same name. Both have since been destroyed along with many other symbols of old gods with the introduction of Christianity in the early 19th century. They were presided over by two hereditary High Priests of Rongo. At the Orongo marae a human sacrifice was laid on a smooth block of limestone or sandstone in front of Rongo&#x27;s image. Human bone fragments can still be found among the remnants at the site. At the Akaoro marae, it is evident that a platform of hala wood was erected for human sacrifice, although no traces of raised platforms have been found. In the Ivirua district was also Ivanui marae, but this was abandoned in favour of Orongo marae; it was referred to in an &quot;eva&quot; dance:

A reference to Rongo is such:

<text>In Hawaiian mythology, Kāne is considered the highest of the three major Hawaiian deities, along with Kū and Lono. He represented the god of procreation and was worshipped as ancestor of chiefs and commoners. Kāne is the creator and gives life associated with dawn, sun and sky. No human sacrifice or laborious ritual was needed in the worship of Kāne. In the Kumuhonua legend, he created Earth, bestowed upon it sea creatures, animals, plants, as well as created man and woman.

==Mythology==
The 1907 book &quot;Legends of Hawaii&quot; has the following account of creation involving Kāne. The author says that there are several versions of this story, probably due to waves of immigration from different areas of Polynesia at different times, but generally they agree on the major points. It says that in the beginning, there was nothing but Po; the endless black chaos. Then Kāne, sensing that he was separate from the Po, pulled himself free of Po by an act of sheer will. Sensing Kāne&#x27;s presence, Lono and then Kū also pulled themselves free of Po. Then Kāne created the light to push back Po. Lono brought sound to the universe and Kū brought substance. Between them, they created all the lesser Gods. Then together, the three Gods created the Menehune, the lesser spirits to be their messengers and servants. After they created the world to be a footstool for the Gods. Finally, they gathered red clay from the four corners of the world, they mixed the clay with their spittle and molded it into the shape of a man. Then Kāne took a special magical white clay and formed it into a head. Then the three Gods breathed life into the statue and created the first man. The first man was created in the image of Kāne.

There is a parallel legend that says that Kāne alone breathed life into the man-statue. That version of the creation myth found in Sacred Texts credits Kāne alone with the creation of the heavens. It then goes on to explain man was made in the image of Kāne by the hands of Ku with Lono as an assistant. At the same time, Kanaloa tried to duplicate Kāne&#x27;s feat, but his statue failed to come to life. So he challenged him, saying something to the effect, &quot;that man will live only a certain span of time, then he will die. When he dies, I will claim him as my own.&quot; This seems to tie in with his position as ruler of the dead as an entity separate from Kāne. Some versions say that Kanaloa is the alter ego of Kāne, the dark half so to speak. Others say he is a lesser god who was created to be in charge of the dead. The author of this particular book says that in the oldest legends, prior to about 1100 A.D., there is no mention of Kanaloa. The author is of the opinion that Kanaloa is, therefore, an addition from some later wave of immigration to the islands. An alternative version has Kanaloa as god of the sea associated with squid or an octopus often seen in the same light as Christian devil and the counterpart of Kāne through the stories of strife.

There is another completely separate legend about the creation of man found in the Kumulipo. The first-born son of the Wākea the sky god and Hoʻohokukalani the keeper of stars is stillborn. When he is buried, the first Kalo plant springs from his navel. Named Hāloa or Long Breathe. The second-born son named after the first, is the first modern man. Hence the two sons are eternally connected. Man tends his brother the Kalo, and the Kalo feeds his brother the man. In that version, there is no mention of Kāne.

Aloha, the traditional greeting, was originally spoken while touching foreheads and exchanging a breath of air. This is possibly a reflection of the legend, exchanging the breath of life, Håloa; originally given by the Gods.

The joy of victory was tempered by the news that his mother, Cecilia Gonzales De La Hoya (November 22, 1950 – October 28, 1990), was terminally ill with breast cancer. She died that October, expressing the hope that her son would one day become an Olympic gold medalist.

As the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona approached, De La Hoya turned his mother&#x27;s dream into a strong focus for his training. After an upset victory in the first round over the Cuban boxer Julio Gonzalez; De La Hoya defeated German boxer Marco Rudolph to win the gold medal. Rudolph had been the only fighter to defeat him in the years leading up to the fight, adding drama. The U.S. media publicized his quest to fulfill his mother&#x27;s dying wish and nicknamed him &quot;The Golden Boy&quot;, which has remained with him throughout his career. In 2000, the Cecilia Gonzalez De La Hoya Cancer Center was formally opened by De La Hoya and his siblings at the White Memorial Medical Center (WMMC), with a $350,000 donation from De La Hoya, in honor of their mother.

==Professional career==

===Super featherweight===
On November 23, 1992, De La Hoya made his professional debut by scoring a first-round KO victory over Lamar Williams in 1 minute 42 seconds.

====De La Hoya vs. Concepción cancellation====
De La Hoya was scheduled to fight Jesús Vidal Concepción in a ten-round junior lightweight bout on December 9, 1993, televised by ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Thursday Night Fights&quot; at the Paramount Theatre in New York City, but pulled out due to a wrist injury. Some found the injury suspicious and speculated that Oscar was being overdramatic. Oscar said that he aggravated an old ligament injury while hitting the heavy bag a week before. Later that month De La Hoya would fire his co-managers Mittleman and Nelson over money issues.
====First title shot and defense====

In his twelfth professional fight, he won his first world title at age 20, stopping Jimmy Bredahl (16–0) in the tenth round to win the WBO junior lightweight title. He defended the title once, stopping Giorgio Campanella (20–0) in three rounds.

===Lightweight===

On July 29, 1994, he knocked out Jorge Páez (53–6–4) in the second round to win the vacant WBO Lightweight title. He would successfully defend the title twice to close 1994, defeating fringe contenders Carl Griffith and John Avila, both by technical knockout. In February 1995, he defeated John-John Molina (36–3), who had recently vacated his IBF Super Featherweight title, by unanimous decision.

====De La Hoya vs. Ruelas unification====

On May 6, 1995, De La Hoya defeated IBF lightweight champion Rafael Ruelas (43–1–0) in a unification bout. De La Hoya knocked Ruelas down twice before the fight was stopped in the second round. The IBF then ordered De La Hoya to defend against Miguel Julio.

====De La Hoya vs. Hernández====

He relinquished the IBF title and defended the WBO title against undefeated Genaro Hernández (32–0–1), who relinquished the WBA super-featherweight title to fight De La Hoya.

====De La Hoya vs. Leija====

Hernandez quit after six rounds because of a broken nose. In his sixth and final defense of the WBO lightweight title, he knocked out Jesse James Leija (30–1–2) in two rounds at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden.

===Light welterweight===

====Chávez vs. De La Hoya====

On June 7, 1996, Oscar De La Hoya fought Mexican legend Julio César Chávez (96–1–1) for the lineal and WBC light welterweight championship. De la Hoya, with a record of 21–0 with 19 K.Os, defeated Chavez by a fourth-round TKO. The fight was stopped due to several bad cuts suffered by Chavez above his left eye. Until their rematch in 1998, Chávez stated that De La Hoya did not defeat him since the fight was stopped. 

====De L Hoya vs. González====

De La Hoya successfully defended his titles with a twelve-round unanimous decision against undefeated former WBC Lightweight Champion and number one light welterweight contender Miguel Ángel González (41–0–0).

===Welterweight===

====Whitaker vs. De La Hoya====

In 1997, De La Hoya moved up to the welterweight division and fought Pernell Whitaker (40–1–1). The fight proved to be a difficult one. Whitaker frustrated De La Hoya with his defense, and landed more overall shots than De La Hoya, but De La Hoya&#x27;s power punches and aggression swayed the judges more in his favor. De La Hoya won a twelve-round unanimous decision to capture the lineal and WBC titles. He also became the Ring Magazine&#x27;s number-one ranked pound-for-pound fighter.

====De La Hoya vs. Kamau====

On June 14, 1997, De La Hoya made the first successful defense of his WBC welterweight title, defeating David Kamau by second-round KO.

====De La Hoya vs. Quartey====

In his next bout, he faced undefeated former WBA Welterweight Champion Ike Quartey (34–0–1) and won by a somewhat disputable split decision. De La Hoya was knocked down once in the fight, while Quartey was down twice. He then defeated Oba Carr (48–2–1) by eleventh-round TKO.

====De La Hoya vs. Trinidad unification====

After seven defenses of his lineal and WBC welterweight titles, De La Hoya fought rival and IBF Champion Félix Trinidad (35–0) on September 18, 1999, in one of the biggest pay-per-view events in history, setting a record for a non-heavyweight fight. De La Hoya stayed just outside Trinidad&#x27;s range while generating much success with his stiff jab and blitzing combinations, but in the last 2-3 rounds of the fight, heeding the strict instructions of his corner, who felt that De La Hoya was way ahead on the scorecards, De La Hoya shut down much of his offense and evaded trading with Trinidad. De La Hoya virtually gave away the last couple of rounds. Though landing well over 100 more punches, Trinidad was ultimately awarded a majority decision. The judges scorecards came under question after the decision. Fans and boxing analysts called for a rematch, which never happened.

====De La Hoya vs. Opponents ====

On February 26, 2000, De La Hoya knocked out Derrell Coley (34–1–2) in a WBC eliminator. The WBC later awarded De La Hoya its welterweight title after Trinidad vacated it, which he lost to Shane Mosley (34–0) by a split decision on June 17, 2000. One judge scored the fight 115–113 for De La Hoya, and the other two scored it 116–112 and 115–113 for Mosley.

De La Hoya successfully sued Bob Arum in 2000 to break his contract with the promoter. The courts ruled in favor of De La Hoya in February 2001.&quot;

De La Hoya defeated Arturo Gatti (33–4) by fifth-round TKO on March 24, 2001.

===Light middleweight===
He then moved up to light middleweight, challenging the lineal and WBC champion Javier Castillejo. De La Hoya won the fight, winning almost every round and knocking Castillejo (51–4) down with ten seconds to go to win the title by a unanimous decision.

====De La Hoya vs. Karmazin cancellation====
On October 8, 2001 it was announced that De La Hoya would return to the Grand Olympic Auditorium where he won his first title to defend his WBC light middleweight championship against the WBC No.1 challenger Roman Karmazin, but on November 8, 2001 it was announced the fight was cancelled. Suffering from a torn cartilage in his left wrist, De La Hoya has been forced to cancel his December 8 title defense. He was hoping to fight again on May 4, a date he had already reserved before the injury. It was an old injury, one that De La Hoya incurred in the first round of his 1999 fight against Oba Carr. &quot;It was from a left hook I threw in that fight,&quot; De La Hoya said, &quot;and the pain has been there ever since. &quot;On a scale of one to 10, I would say it was a five or six.&quot;
Ten days ago, on his first day of sparring for the Karmazin match, De La Hoya threw a punch that severely aggravated the wrist. De La Hoya planned on facing a major opponent in May—Trinidad, Mosley, Hopkins, or Vargas—and says he still hopes to do so if he can get WBC approval to put off his mandatory match. De La Hoya said the hand bothered him in his losses against Trinidad and Mosley. &quot;It was always bothering me,&quot; he said, &quot;but we are fighters and we have to tough it out.&quot; The fight seemed to have been cursed from the start. When Karmazin&#x27;s two trainers, his manager and his doctor were all denied visas, the Russian fighter had threatened to go home to train. Karmazin&#x27;s promoter, Frank Moloney, went further, questioning whether the fight would happen.

====Rivalry with Fernando Vargas====

De La Hoya did not fight for the 15 months and in this time the rivalry between him and WBA champion &quot;Ferocious&quot; Fernando Vargas (22–1) grew. They knew each other as amateurs and it is said the rivalry began when Vargas was angered by De La Hoya laughing at him after he fell into a snowbank. De La Hoya said he would never fight him. Eventually, however, De La Hoya accepted a match. The fight was scheduled for May 2002, but De La Hoya had to withdraw because of a hand injury.

The unification bout, labeled &quot;Bad Blood,&quot; finally took place on September 14, 2002, at the Mandalay Bay on the Las Vegas Strip. The fight was even for the first six rounds, with Vargas landing punches on the ropes in the odd rounds, while De La Hoya outboxed him in the even rounds. De La Hoya took over the fight in the seventh round and hurt Vargas with a left hook in the tenth. In the next round, De La Hoya knocked Vargas down with a left hook and stopped him moments later. The win is widely considered to be the biggest of De La Hoya&#x27;s career. Vargas tested positive for stanozolol after the fight.

====De La Hoya vs. Mosley II====

De La Hoya defended his unified title against Yori Boy Campas (80–5) with a routine seventh round stoppage then faced Shane Mosley (38–2) in a rematch. The fight, billed as &quot;Retribution&quot; and staged at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, was more of a boxing match than their first encounter, and while some rounds were close, De La Hoya&#x27;s game plan utilizing his jab seemed to be paying off, leaving Mosley visually frustrated. It was De La Hoya who seemed to be landing the cleaner, more effective punches, and obliterated Mosley in Compubox, landing over 100 more. But judges apparently didn&#x27;t see it that way awarding Mosley with the controversial unanimous decision. Mosley was later connected to the BALCO Labs steroid scandal. Jeff Novitzky, a lead investigator on the BALCO case, reported that documents seized from the lab show that Mosley received &quot;the clear&quot; and &quot;the cream,&quot; both designer steroids. Mosley reportedly began his doping regimen prior to his rematch with Oscar De La Hoya. Mosley would later admit to using performance-enhancing drugs from BALCO for this bout, saying he thought they were legal supplements.

===Middleweight===

====Sturm vs. De La Hoya====

De la Hoya next challenged Felix Sturm (20–0) for the WBO middleweight title, on June 5, 2004, with the winner also getting a shot at the undisputed world middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins. De La Hoya was awarded a unanimous decision, becoming the first boxer in history to win world titles in six different weight divisions. All three judges scored the bout 115–113 in favor of De La Hoya. The decision was very controversial, far more so than his decision wins over Pernell Whitaker or Ike Quartey. Whereas the Whitaker and Quartey fights were considered close bouts that could have gone either way or been called a draw, general opinion was that De La Hoya lost to Sturm, with Compubox counting Sturm as landing 234 of 541 punches, while counting De La Hoya as landing 188 of 792. There had been some rumblings throughout the boxing community already before the fight, that a decision would be made to insure that De La Hoya would fight Hopkins in a mega-dollar fight that would&#x27;ve drawn more money than a Hopkins-Sturm matchup would. Iain Darke of &quot;Sky Sports&quot; said the decision looked &quot;tailor made&quot; to set up De La Hoya versus Hopkins. &quot;(De La Hoya) got the benefit of high charity,&quot; Darke said. Sturm &amp; his promotional team, Universum Box-Promotion, filed a protest with the Nevada State Athletic Commission over the decision, but it was to no avail, and the decision still stands today.

====De La Hoya vs. Hopkins====

De La Hoya fought Bernard Hopkins (44–2–1) in a unification match on September 18, 2004, in Las Vegas. Hopkins held the WBC, WBA, and IBF middleweight titles, was recognized as lineal and &quot;The Ring&quot; champion, and was considered by many to be the number one pound for pound fighter in the world. Although the fight was at a catchweight of , many thought De La Hoya was too small for the weight class and Hopkins was considered a heavy favorite.

Several days before the fight, De La Hoya&#x27;s hand was cut when his wraps were being cut off after training, requiring eleven stitches to close. He and his corner both maintained it was not an issue going into the bout.

De La Hoya fought a tactical fight. After eight rounds, De La Hoya was ahead 77–75 on one scorecard and behind 78–74 and 79–73 on the other two. In the ninth round Hopkins threw a left hook towards De La Hoya&#x27;s body, sending him crumbling to the canvas, where he was counted out. It was the first time in De La Hoya&#x27;s career that he had been KO&#x27;d. De la Hoya later stated that he couldn&#x27;t get up because the pain of a well-placed liver shot was unbearable. Despite losing, De La Hoya made over $30 million from the fight. Hopkins eventually became a minor shareholder in Golden Boy, and served as the east coast representative for the company. Bob Arum claimed De La Hoya &quot;quit.&quot; Like Mosley, Hopkins would subsequently be represented by Golden Boy Promotions.

===Comeback===

====De La Hoya vs. Mayorga====

De La Hoya took a layoff of 20 months before signing to fight WBC light middleweight titleholder Ricardo Mayorga (27–5–1). In the buildup to the fight, Mayorga insulted everything from De La Hoya&#x27;s sexuality to his wife and child, but when they fought on May 6, 2006, De La Hoya knocked Mayorga down in the first minute of the fight with a left hook. He knocked him out in the sixth round to take his tenth world title.

===De La Hoya vs. Mayweather Jr.===

In early 2007, De La Hoya signed to defend his title against WBC welterweight champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. (37–0–0). De La Hoya was a two to one underdog in the fight.

The fight took place on May 5, 2007, at a sold-out arena at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. De La Hoya pressed throughout, doing best when using his left jab. Mayweather controlled the later rounds and was awarded a split decision, with judge Chuck Giampi scoring the bout 116–112 for Mayweather, Jerry Roth 115–113 for Mayweather, and Tom Kaczmarcek 115–113 for De La Hoya. The Associated Press had it for Mayweather, 116–112.

Although Oscar chased Mayweather and threw many combinations en route to throwing over 100 more total punches, Mayweather landed at a higher rate; according to Compubox he connected on 207 of 481 punches thrown, De La Hoya on only 122 of 587.

===De La Hoya vs. Forbes===

On May 3, 2008, at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California, De La Hoya fought Steve Forbes (33–5) in a tuneup for a possible rematch with Mayweather. De La Hoya showed a more relaxed style, throwing a constant jab and always staying on his toes. He opened a cut near Forbes&#x27; eye in the sixth round, going on to win by unanimous decision in 12.`

On June 6, 2008, Floyd Mayweather Jr. announced his first of many subsequent retirements from boxing, effectively ending talk of a rematch.

===De La Hoya vs. Pacquiao===
De La Hoya faced Manny Pacquiao (47–3–2) on December 6, 2008 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Presented by Golden Boy Promotions and Top Rank, Inc., the bout was a twelve-round, non-title fight at the welterweight limit. Although Pacquiao went into the fight recognized as the leading pound for pound boxer in the world, some pundits speculated that 147 pounds could have been too far above his natural weight against the larger De La Hoya. However, Pacquiao&#x27;s trainer Freddie Roach was confident of a victory as he stated that De La Hoya could no longer &quot;pull the trigger&quot; at that stage of his career. De La Hoya, who was favored to win the bout due to his size advantage, was expected to be the heavier of the two on fight night. However, though Pacquiao weighed and De La Hoya at the official weigh-in on Friday, De La Hoya entered the ring at 147 pounds to Pacquiao&#x27;s .

De La Hoya took a beating and his corner stopped the fight after the eighth round. Pacquiao was ahead on all three judges&#x27; scorecards before the stoppage, with two judges scoring the fight 80–71 and the other judge scoring it at 79–72. After the bout, Pacquiao&#x27;s trainer Freddie Roach stated, &quot;We knew we had him after the first round. He had no legs, he was hesitant and he was shot.&quot; Confirming Roach&#x27;s pre-fight predictions that he&#x27;d grown too old, De La Hoya crossed the ring to Pacquiao&#x27;s corner after the bout was stopped and told Roach, &quot;You&#x27;re right, Freddie. I don&#x27;t have it anymore.&quot; When asked by reporters whether he would continue fighting, De La Hoya responded, &quot;My heart still wants to fight, that&#x27;s for sure,&quot; De La Hoya said. &quot;But when your physical doesn&#x27;t respond, what can you do? I have to be smart and make sure I think about my future plans.&quot;

===Retirement and proposed comeback===
De La Hoya announced his retirement on April 14, 2009, ending any speculation about a potential fight with Julio César Chávez Jr., son of the former champion and Mexican icon Julio César Chávez, Sr. Later in 2009, De La Hoya held an exhibition boxing fight versus basketball player Shaquille O&#x27;Neal as an episode of the television show &quot;Shaq Vs.&quot;

<text>In Hawaiian religion, Hiʻiaka is a daughter of Haumea and Kāne.

Hiʻiakaikapoliopele is the Hawaiian patron goddess of hula dancers, chant, sorcery, and medicine. Born in Tahiti and brought by her sister to Hawaii Pelehonuamea, Hi&#x27;iaka is also known as the goddess of hula. She played a significant role in the story of Lohi&#x27;au, where she embarked on a dangerous journey to bring him to Pele. Throughout her quest, Hi&#x27;iaka discovered her powers as a healer of land, making it fertile and causing growth. She also defeated many monsters and faced various challenges with the help of companions and gifts from Pele. In the end, after Pele destroyed Hi&#x27;iaka&#x27;s sacred forest and lover, Lohi&#x27;au was given the choice of who to be with, resulting in different versions of the legend&#x27;s conclusion. Hiʻiaka had multiple sisters, and together they represented various aspects of nature and life in Hawaii.

==Attributes and history==
Hiiaka is the patron goddess of hula dancers, chant, sorcery, and medicine. Owls are her messengers and are sacred to her. Conceived in Tahiti, Hiiaka was carried in the form of an egg to Hawaii by her sister Pele, who kept the egg with her at all times to incubate it. Thus, the name &quot;Hiiaka&quot; means &quot;carried egg,&quot; as &quot;hii&quot; means to hold or carry in the arms (as a child) and &quot;aka&quot; means &quot;embryo.&quot; Hiiaka&#x27;s full name, Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele, also refers to the story as it translates as &quot;Hiiaka in the bosom of Pele.&quot; Her family line is called Hiiaka, and they take on the task of bearing the clouds, providing rain, thunder, and lightning, variously produced by storms and by Pele&#x27;s volcanoes. Hiiaka lived in a grove of lehua trees which are sacred to her where she spent her days dancing with the forest spirits. Hiiaka is Pele&#x27;s favorite and most loyal sister, although they also have their differences. Hiiaka was the first god of the Pele family born in Hawaiʻi.
== Goddess of Hula and the importance of traditions ==
Hiʻiaka was the first to dance hula after her eldest sister Pele asked her to do so. Therefore, Hiʻiaka is known as a goddess of hula, along with Laka and Kapo (other sisters of Pele). In hula &quot;hālau&quot; (schools), there are ceremonies for these goddesses.

&quot;Oli kāhea&quot; are chants asking for permission to enter a place (such as someone&#x27;s home or a ceremony). These chants are also used when asking someone intelligent, such as a teacher, to share their knowledge. &quot;Oli kāhea&quot; are used to ask for permission to enter a forest, since many forests are considered homes of the gods. In hula &quot;hālau&quot;, &quot;oli&quot; and &quot;mele kāhea&quot; are chanted by the &quot;haumana&quot; (students) who use them to request that their &quot;kumu&quot; (teachers) allow them entry into the &quot;hālau&quot;. When chanting &quot;oli kāhea&quot;, Hawaiians are taught to be humble and to have good &quot;ʻano&quot; (proper spirit and intention).

The importance of &quot;mele kahea&quot; and the responsibility of those receiving &quot;mele kahea&quot; is seen in different parts of Hiʻiaka&#x27;s quest to Lohiʻau. For example, when the chief of Maui denied Hiʻiaka hospitality after she asked for permission to enter his home through her &quot;mele kahea&quot;, Hiʻiaka punished him. When the chief was sleeping, Hiʻiaka caught his spirit after it left his body, and killed it, thereby killing him. Therefore, Hawaiians are taught that being on both the giving and receiving parts of &quot;oli&quot; (chants) require respect and mindfulness of our actions.

== Lohiʻau ==
In the best known story, Pele once fell into a deep sleep and left her body to wander, and was lured by the sound of a hula-drum accompanied by a wonderful voice. In the Epic Tale of Hiʻiakaikapoliopele, it is said that Pele did not accidentally hear the sounds of the drums and voices. Instead, this version says that Kanikawi and Kanikawa (the gods of Lohiʻau and his people) wanted Pele to specifically hear Lohiʻau, and later become his wife. She appeared in spirit at a festival on Kauai (in most versions of the legend; another variation has her visit Kauai physically while first seeking a home) where she fell in love with the singer, a young chief named Lohiʻau. Hiiaka had been watching over her, and after nine days she grew worried and sang an incantation to bring Pele back. Upon her return, Pele longed for Lohiʻau and decided to send a messenger to bring him to her. Hiiaka volunteered to go on the dangerous journey, as long as Pele would protect her sacred grove of Lehua trees and her lover, Hōpoe (meaning &quot;one encircled, as with a lei or with loving arms&quot;).

Pele agreed to Hiiaka&#x27;s request, but insisted that she return with Lohiʻau within 40 days. She also instructed Hiiaka not to fall in love with Lohiʻau, or even embrace him.

=== Gifts/Tools ===
Before Hiʻiaka left for her quest, Pele gifted her with three tools to help her face the trials throughout the quest. The first gift was ʻAwihikalani (a critical eye), to help her to foretell the future encounters she would face, communicate with spirits, and grant her the ability to have supernatural knowledge. The second gift was called Ka lima ikaika o Kīlauea (the &quot;strong arm&quot; of Kilauea), to help her defeat her opponents in battle with super strength. The last gift was Paʻu uila (lightning skirt), this skirt had different abilities to help her along her journey. This skirt also had extreme importance due to the fact that it is a female garment, showing the significance of supernatural women in Hawaiʻi not being ruled by male gods.

=== Companions ===
Paʻuopalapalai (Fern Skirt) was a loyal servant to the Pele family for so long that she had become like a spirit. Therefore, she was trusted to be Hiʻiaka&#x27;s companion on the journey. After the two left Kīlauea, they met a very devout and pious woman named Wahine ʻOmaʻo (Green Woman), who joined them on the journey after she made her offerings to Pele. Wahine ʻOmaʻo was a half-goddess. She was the only companion of Hiʻiaka who completed the entire journey with her.

=== Journey/Battles of Hiʻiaka ===
Hiiaka&#x27;s journey was filled with many adventures, such as dueling with the &quot;kupua&quot; (demons) of the island forests.

When the travelers arrived at Puna ma Kai, they met a gorgeous princess named Papulehu. She gifted them with red lehua and maile lei (garland). These are the plants that Puna is famous for. She was kind and gracious, however, she was not devout and did not take the time for prayers. Therefore, she did not last the first battle of the journey. Since she did not pray, she had no spiritual sight during the battle against the moʻo Panaʻewa, whom she was eaten by. Panaʻewa could change into different forms like kino-ohu (fog), kino-au-awa (sharp rain), and kukui (candle-nut tree). Hiʻiaka defeated Panaʻewa by trapping her and her followers within a thickening of vines. Many more moʻo, as well as other monsters, are defeated as they traveled across Hawaiʻi. They also had the help of war gods (named Kuliliaukaua and Kekakoʻi), as well as shell-conch blowers (named Kamaiau, Kahinihini, and Mapu).

When passing through Maui, Hiʻiaka and Wahine ʻOmaʻo are denied hospitality by Chief Olepau in Iao Valley. Hiʻiaka punished him with death by catching his second soul (after it left his body and wandered while he was sleeping). She pounded his body against Pahalele, the rock near Waiheʻe.

Hiʻiaka and Wahine ʻOmaʻo headed towards Oahu by passing by the extremely windy side of Molokai, called Kaunakakai. The women came across a moʻo tribe that was causing havoc to women of the area by taking their husbands. Therefore, Hiʻiaka and Wahine ʻOmaʻo exiled the moʻo tribe. They also defeated Kikipua, the mo&#x27;o woman who would eat travelers by tricking them that her tongue was a bridge. After she was defeated, Hiʻiaka used her paʻu as a bridge to Oʻahu for safe passage.

Hiʻiaka showed respect to her supernatural relatives, the rocks Maka-puʻu and Malei, when they arrived to the rocky side of Oʻahu through oli (chants). On Oʻahu, she also crushed Mokoliʻi, an evil moʻo, at Kualoa. When they arrived at Kaena point, Hiʻiaka pleaded the Rock-of-Kauai to send her a canoe to paddle over to Kauaʻi. The Rock-of Kauai traces back to Māui (mythology), when it was left at sea after his fishline broke. Hiʻiaka&#x27;s request was granted and she arrived on Kauaʻi at Haʻena to finally reach Lohiʻau.

When at last Hiʻiaka reached Kauaʻi she found that the young chief had died from longing for Pele. She was able to revive him with chanting and prayer, but she was not able to return to Pele within 40 days. Pele, fearing that Hiʻiaka had betrayed her and was keeping the handsome chief for herself, became enraged and not only destroyed Hiʻiaka&#x27;s sacred Lehua forest, but also killed Hōpoe, turning her into stone.

When Hiiaka returned, seeing her lover dead and her forest ravaged, she took revenge on Pele and embraced Lohiʻau. In retaliation, Pele sent waves of lava at the couple. Hiiaka was unharmed, but Lohiʻau was killed by the lava. Again, Hiiaka revived him, thus bringing him back to life twice.

Pele, regretting her actions toward Hiiaka&#x27;s forest and lover, decided to let Lohiʻau choose who he wanted to be with. Some versions of the legend say that Lohiʻau chose Hiiaka over Pele and returned with her to Kauai. Others say he decided to remain with the both of them. Still others say that he retreated to Kauai alone.

The educational Hawaiian website, Living Hawaiian Culture Kumukahi, stated that &quot;During this long and dangerous trip, Hiʻiaka realizes her own powers as a goddess. She is the healer of land. Pele creates new land and Hiʻiaka follows by healing the land, making it fertile and causing things to grow.&quot;

==Hiiaka sisters==
There were &quot;twelve&quot; or &quot;forty sisters&quot;, all daughters of Haumea. [The word /hii-aka/ has the meaning of &#x27;embryo&#x27;, and is a compound of /hii/ &#x27;to hold or carry in the arms (scil., a child)&#x27; and /aka/ &#x27;embryo at the moment of conception; carefully&#x27;.]

===Hiiaka-i-ka-pua-enaena===
One sister included Hiiaka-i-ka-pua-enaena: &quot;The skin of any person she possessed reddened. She was also known as Kuku-ena-i-ke-ahi-hoomau-honua (beating hot in the perpetual earth fire), and in this guise she was ... guide to travelers lost in the wilderness, and vanished when they found their way. She was also known as Hiiaka-i-ka-puaaneane (Hiiaka in extreme old age). &quot;Lit&quot;., Hiiaka in the smoking heat.&quot;

===Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele===
They also included Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele: &quot;One of her forms was the &quot;palaā&quot; lace fern ... one of the first plants to grow on new lava. ... She instituted the eating of fish from head to tail. ... &quot;Lit&quot;., Hiiaka in the bosom of Pele.&quot;

=== Defeating monsters ===
Soul-journey in &quot;a deep sleep during which the spirit leaves her body&quot;:- 
&quot;Hiiaka fights and overcomes a number of ... monsters. 
*The moo woman Panaewa, who impedes her way first in the form of fog (kino-ohu), then of sharp rain (kino-au-awa), then of a candlenut (kukui) tree, she entangles ... in a growth of vine ... .
*Two moo, Kiha and Puaa-loa (Long hog), are caught in a flow of lava ... .
*The shark at the mouth of Waipio valley who seizes swimmers crossing the bay is met and slain.
*Moolau, chief of the jumping moʻo (mahiki) in the land of Mahiki-waena, is defied ... .
*Two moo, Pili and Noho, who make travelers pay toll at the bridge across the Wailuku river, are rent jaw to jaw and the way opened for free traffic.&quot;

=== Shamanic soul-catching ===
*&quot;Refused hospitality at the home of the chief Olepau [or Kaulahea] in Iao valley, Hiiaka avenges the insult by catching his second soul, as it goes fluttering about as he lies sleeping, and dashing it against the rock Palahele near Waihee.&quot;
*&quot;Peleula is a famous makaula or seer, but Hiiaka prevails over her. Waihinano, the pert sorceress who defies her on Maui, has been brought up by Kapo and Pua, but Hiiaka catches and crushes to death the soul of the Maui chief for which they both contend. ... Pele gives Hiiaka to Paoa as his wife and he returns with her to Kauaʻi&quot;.

<text>Haumea (Hawaiian: ) is the goddess of fertility and childbirth in Hawaiian mythology. She is the mother of many important deities, such as Pele, Kāne Milohai, Kāmohoaliʻi, Nāmaka, Kapo, and Hiʻiaka. She was killed by Kaulu. Haumea is one of the most important Hawaiian gods, and her worship is among the oldest on the Hawaiian islands.

== Mythology ==
With the help of a magic stick called the Mākālei, Haumea repeatedly transforms herself from an old woman to a young girl, and returns to her homeland periodically to marry one of her offspring, thus giving birth to continuous generations of humans. Eventually, her identity is found out by Kio, which angers her, causing her to leave humanity behind.

Haumea is said to have given humans the ability to give birth naturally. In a story, she visited Muleiula, the daughter of a chieftain who was experiencing painful childbirth, during which she discovered that humans only gave birth by cutting open the mother. Seeing this, Haumea created a potion out of the Kani-ka-wī tree (&quot;Spondias dulcis&quot;), which allowed the mother to push out the baby naturally.

== Relationships ==
Haumea is the sister of the gods Kāne and Kanaloa, and sometimes also the wife of Kanaloa. Some traditions identify Haumea with Papahānaumoku, the goddess of the Earth, and wife of the sky god Wākea.

===Offspring===
With Kanaloa, Haumea gave birth to the war god Kekaua-kahi, the volcano goddess Pele, as well as Pele&#x27;s brothers and sisters, including Hi&#x27;iaka. Except for Pele, who was born the normal way, her children were born from various parts of her body. From her head, for example, were born Laumiha, Kahaʻula, Kahakauakoko, and Kauakahi.

==== Kumulipo ====
According to the &quot;Kumulipo&quot;, a Hawaiian creation chant, Haumea&#x27;s offspring are:
*Children by Mulinaha: 
**Laumiha
**Kahaʻula
**Kahakauakoko

*Children by Kanaloa:
**Kauakahi

*Grandchildren:
**Kauahulihonua
**Haloa
**Waia
**Hinanalo
**Nanakahili
**Wailoa
**Kiʻo (last born)

==Death==
==Legacy==

On September 17, 2008, the International Astronomical Union named the fifth known dwarf planet in the Solar System &quot;Haumea&quot;. The planet&#x27;s two moons were named after Haumea&#x27;s daughters: Hiʻiaka, the goddess born from the mouth of Haumea, and Namaka, the water spirit born from Haumea&#x27;s body.

<text>In Hawaiian mythology, Kaulu is a trickster god who killed goddess Haumea at Niuhelewai, by catching her in a net obtained from Makali’i. He then killed Lonokaeho, also called Piokeanuenue, king of Ko&#x27;olau, by singing an incantation. Kaulu is known for being extremely powerful and strong, both physically and with magic, and he had many adventures in Hawaiian mythology. He is known for his control over the forces of nature and the weather patterns on the islands.

== Family ==
His parents were Kukaohialaka and Hinauluohia and he was born on Oahu island. Kaulu was the youngest of three siblings, his older brother&#x27;s were named Kaeha and Kamano. When Kaulu was still a baby in his mother&#x27;s womb, his older brother Kamano threatened to kill him, but then Kaulu’s other brother, Kaeha, said he would protect Kaulu. Because of the danger of Kamano, Kaulu waited for five years in his mother&#x27;s womb, and he shapeshifted into a piece of rope to be born.

Kaulu was then born as a piece of rope, and so, Kamano did not kill him, and Kaeha put the rope on a shelf and protected it until Kaulu turned back into humanoid form. Although it is unclear just what exactly Kaulu’s parents were, as they might have been either humans or gods or perhaps a sort of humanoid race of earthly gods, Kaulu himself is definitely a deity and is often thought of as a trickster god. Kaulu grew up and was very strong and powerful, and he protected Kaeha and saved him from many attacks by other gods and monsters. Kaulu&#x27;s wife was called Lanikai and she never bore any children.

== Abilities ==
The Hawaiian god Kaulu has many strange abilities and is an extremely powerful fighter. This in which Kaulu is a trickster god and is quite destructive and at times violent, and is known for being one of the most powerful beings in Hawaiian mythology. In fact, Kaulu was even powerful enough to kill several other deities of the Hawaiian pantheon. Kaulu is immortal and does not age. Kaulu also seems to be invulnerable to being harmed when fighting. In one the legends of Kaulu, he fought against some of the other gods and killed them, and he killed a huge monster shark. Kaulu had his strange abilities since birth, he was already able to shapeshift, speak, and other things.

Kaulu&#x27;s brother Kaeha also displayed his shapeshifting ability when he turned into a tiny size and hid in a leaf while speaking to people as a prank, and making them sacrifice their alcoholic beverage to him. Kaulu also has the ability to communicate with spirits, and when he was a kid he used the spirits to find his brother Kaeha. It would seem that Kaulu actually has some kind of reality warping ability as well. When Kaulu was just a child he challenged the ocean and its waves to a fight, and the huge, many story high waves crashed against him, but he didn&#x27;t even budge. 

Kaulu then struck the ocean, and ever since then, the waves around Hawaii have been much smaller. In another legend, Kaulu&#x27;s brother Kaeha was tricked by some of the gods to go out on a surfboard then be eaten by the chief of sharks, so Kaulu then drained the entire ocean by drinking it, hence why the ocean is salty. Kaulu then tore the jaws of the shark apart with his bare hands and freed and saved his brother Kaeha. The story mentions Kaulu being attacked by some other supernatural figure with a lightning bolt, and Kaulu blocked the lightning bolt with one finger. 

In the legends of Kaulu, he was even able to pull pranks on the spirits and gods and was so good at shapeshifting that not even spirits could find him when he hid from them. The Hawaiian seer or sage Makali stated that Kaulu is &quot;all-powerful&quot;. In another part of the legend, Kaulu flies or travels to the realm of the gods in heaven and asks them for food. The guards jokingly agree to let him have as much as he can carry, and Kaulu takes all of the food and storage of their entire farm in his arms.
==Stories of Kaulu==
In one of Kaulu&#x27;s first stories as a kid, he challenged the ocean and its waves to a fight. Kaulu mocked the spirits which control the waves and swells, and taunted them. Kaulu asked them how strong they were and when they said they were very strong, Kaulu fought them. When Kaulu struck the surf and waves, it caused them to become weak and that is why the waves are smaller today. In another feat of reality bending, Kaulu then faced off against a huge dog monster and tore it to bloody pieces, which is why dogs are smaller now as well, says the story. 

Kaulu then found his older brother Kaeha, and he lived in a village where there were also a certain group called The Akua, possibly spirits. They all liked to drink an alcoholic beverage called Awa. Kaulu and his brother Kaeha performed pranks on the Akua, before they went to all drink Awa, Kaulu told his brother Kaeha &quot;Yes, tell the akua to drink their &#x27;awa first, and you will take yours after them. But before you drink yours, offer a little to me as your god by saying: &#x27;Here is our awa.&quot; Kaeha then did so, and after sacrificing to Kaulu, Kaulu answered from the darkness, hiding in a leaf. 

The Akua then thought Kaeha had a powerful god he was sacrificing to, and it even puzzled Kane and Kanaloa, who then sent Kolea to ask the sage Makali about it. Makali said &quot;Kaulu, the youngest brother of Kaeha is all-powerful and strong, and he&#x27;s hiding in the palm leaves.&quot; The Akua then searched for Kaulu in the palm leaves but could not find him. One story says he put stones in the resting places of &quot;The akua&quot; so they would hit their heads on them when they woke up, and then tried to attack Kaeha and Kaulu, and refused to share food with them. Kaulu is often described as a small and young looking boy in these stories.

Multiple Hawaiian legends tell of a great famine that once struck Hawaii. Some versions of the story cite Haumea as the cause, and show Kaulu as the hero who saves the people by tricking the gods and sages in heaven into letting him take all their food. Kaulu then obtains a magical net from the divine sage Makali&#x27;i and uses it to trap and murder Haumea.
Another part of the Kaulu story says he killed the &quot;shark of the gods&quot;, which was a huge chief shark that some of the Hawaiian gods used to send out to kill things with.
Kaulu killed Kukama-ulu-nui-akea, who apparently he then threw up into the milky way, out into the galaxy.

&quot;The king shark of Kane and Kanaloa in Lewa-lani, called Ku-kama-ulu-nui-akea or Kalake‘e-nui-a-Kane, whom Kaulu slays in this legend and whose spirit flies up to the Milky Way, has its prototype in the South Seas. In the Tuamotus the Milky Way is the sacred ocean of Kiho-tumu; the dark rift in the Milky Way is his sacred ship, called The-long-shark.&quot;

<text>In music, solfège (, ) or solfeggio (; ), also called sol-fa, solfa, solfeo, among many names, is a mnemonic used in teaching aural skills, pitch and sight-reading of Western music. Solfège is a form of solmization, though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

Syllables are assigned to the notes of the scale and assist the musician in audiating, or mentally hearing, the pitches of a piece of music, often for the purpose of singing them aloud. Through the Renaissance (and much later in some shapenote publications) various interlocking four-, five- and six-note systems were employed to cover the octave. The tonic sol-fa method popularized the seven syllables commonly used in English-speaking countries: &quot;do&quot; (spelled &quot;doh&quot; in tonic sol-fa), &quot;re&quot;, &quot;mi&quot;, &quot;fa&quot;, &quot;so(l)&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, and &quot;ti&quot; (or &quot;si&quot;) (see below).

There are two current ways of applying solfège: 1) fixed do, where the syllables are always tied to specific pitches (e.g., &quot;do&quot; is always &quot;C-natural&quot;) and 2) movable do, where the syllables are assigned to scale degrees, with &quot;do&quot; always the first degree of the major scale.

==Etymology==

Italian &quot; and English/French &quot; derive from the names of two of the syllables used: &quot;sol&quot; and &quot;fa&quot;.

The generic term &quot;solmization&quot;, referring to any system of denoting pitches of a musical scale by syllables, including those used in India and Japan as well as solfège, comes from French , from the Latin syllables &quot;sol&quot; and &quot;mi&quot;.

The verb &quot;to sol-fa&quot; means to sing the solfège syllables of a passage (as opposed to singing the lyrics, humming, etc).

==Origin==
In eleventh-century Italy, the music theorist Guido of Arezzo invented a notational system that named the six notes of the hexachord after the first syllable of each line of the Latin hymn &quot;Ut queant laxis&quot;, the &quot;Hymn to St. John the Baptist&quot;, yielding &quot;ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la&quot;. Each successive line of this hymn begins on the next scale degree, so each note&#x27;s name was the syllable sung at that pitch in this hymn.

&lt;poem&gt;
Ut queant laxīs    resonāre fibrīs
Mīra gestōrum    famulī tuōrum,
Solve pollūtī    labiī reātum,
Sancte Iohannēs.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The words were ascribed to Paulus Diaconus in the 8th century. They translate as:
&lt;poem&gt;
So that your servants may with loosened voices
Resound the wonders of your deeds,
Clean the guilt from our stained lips,
O Saint John.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&quot;Ut&quot; was changed in the 1600s in Italy to the open syllable Do. Guido&#x27;s system had only six notes, but &quot;si&quot; was added later as the seventh note of the diatonic scale. In Anglophone countries, &quot;si&quot; was changed to &quot;ti&quot; by Sarah Glover in the nineteenth century so that every syllable might begin with a different letter. &quot;Ti&quot; is used in tonic sol-fa (and in the famed American show tune &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;).

Some authors speculate that the solfège syllables (&quot;do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti&quot;) might have been influenced by the syllables of the Arabic solmization system called درر مفصّلات &quot;Durar Mufaṣṣalāt&quot; (&quot;Detailed Pearls&quot;) (&quot;dāl, rā&#x27;, mīm, fā&#x27;, ṣād, lām, tā&quot;&#x27;). This mixed-origin theory was brought forward by scholars as early as the seventeenth and eighteenth century, in the works of Francisci a Mesgnien Meninski and Jean-Benjamin de La Borde. Modern scholars are mostly skeptical.

==In Elizabethan England==

In the Elizabethan era, England and its related territories used only four of the syllables: mi, fa, sol, and la. &quot;Mi&quot; stood for modern ti or si, &quot;fa&quot; for modern do or ut, &quot;sol&quot; for modern re, and &quot;la&quot; for modern mi. Then, fa, sol and la would be repeated to also stand for their modern counterparts, resulting in the scale being &quot;fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa&quot;. The use of &quot;fa&quot;, &quot;sol&quot; and &quot;la&quot; for two positions in the scale is a leftover from the Guidonian system of so-called &quot;mutations&quot; (i.e. changes of hexachord on a note, see Guidonian hand). This system was largely eliminated by the 19th century, but is still used in some shape note systems, which give each of the four syllables &quot;fa&quot;, &quot;sol&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, and &quot;mi&quot; a different shape.

An example of this type of solmization occurs in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, where in Act 1, Scene 2, Edmund exclaims to himself right after Edgar&#x27;s entrance so that Edgar can hear him: &quot;O, these eclipses do portend these divisions&quot;. Then, in the 1623 First Folio (but not in the 1608 Quarto), he adds &quot;Fa, so, la, mi&quot;. This Edmund probably sang to the tune of &quot;Fa&quot;, &quot;So&quot;, &quot;La&quot;, &quot;Ti&quot; (e.g. F, G, A, B in C major), i.e. an ascending sequence of three whole tones with an ominous feel to it: see tritone (historical uses).

==Modern use==
Solfège is still used for sight reading training. There are two main types: &quot;Movable do&quot; and &quot;Fixed do&quot;.

===Movable do solfège===
In &quot;Movable do&quot; or &quot;tonic sol-fa&quot;, each syllable corresponds to a scale degree; for example, if the music changes into a higher key, each syllable moves to a correspondingly higher note. This is analogous to the Guidonian practice of giving each degree of the hexachord a solfège name, and is mostly used in Germanic countries, Commonwealth countries, and the United States.

One particularly important variant of movable do, but differing in some respects from the system described below, was invented in the nineteenth century by Sarah Ann Glover, and is known as tonic sol-fa.

In Italy, in 1972, Roberto Goitre wrote the famous method &quot;Cantar leggendo&quot;, which has come to be used for choruses and for music for young children.

The pedagogical advantage of the movable-Do system is its ability to assist in the theoretical understanding of music; because a tonic is established and then sung in comparison to, the student infers melodic and chordal implications through their singing. 

====Major====
Movable do is frequently employed in Australia, China, Japan (with 5th being so, and 7th being si), Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States, Hong Kong, and English-speaking Canada. The movable do system is a fundamental element of the Kodály method used primarily in Hungary, but with a dedicated following worldwide. In the movable do system, each solfège syllable corresponds not to a pitch, but to a scale degree: The first degree of a major scale is always sung as &quot;do&quot;, the second as &quot;re&quot;, etc. (For minor keys, see below.) In movable do, a given tune is therefore always sol-faed on the same syllables, no matter what key it is in.

The solfège syllables used for movable do differ slightly from those used for fixed do, because the English variant of the basic syllables (&quot;ti&quot; instead of &quot;si&quot;) is usually used, and chromatically altered syllables are usually included as well.

If, at a certain point, the key of a piece modulates, then it is necessary to change the solfège syllables at that point. For example, if a piece begins in C major, then C is initially sung on &quot;do&quot;, D on &quot;re&quot;, etc. If, however, the piece then modulates to F major, then F is sung on &quot;do&quot;, G on &quot;re&quot;, etc., and C is then sung on &quot;sol&quot;.

====Minor====
Passages in a minor key may be sol-faed in one of two ways in movable do: either starting on do (using &quot;me&quot;, &quot;le&quot;, and &quot;te&quot; for the lowered third, sixth, and seventh degrees, and &quot;la&quot; and &quot;ti&quot; for the raised sixth and seventh degrees), which is referred to as &quot;do-based minor&quot;, or starting on la (using &quot;fi&quot; and &quot;si&quot; for the raised sixth and seventh degrees). The latter (referred to as &quot;la-based minor&quot;) is sometimes preferred in choral singing, especially with children.

The choice of which system is used for minor makes a difference as to how you handle modulations. In the first case (&quot;do-based minor&quot;), when the key moves for example from C major to C minor the syllable do keeps pointing to the same note, namely C, (there&#x27;s no &quot;mutation&quot; of do&#x27;s note), but when the key shifts from C major to A minor (or A major), the scale is transposed from do = C to do = A. In the second case (&quot;la-based minor&quot;), when the key moves from C major to A minor the syllable do continues to point to the same note, again C, but when the key moves from C major to C minor the scale is transposed from do = C to do = E-flat.

===Fixed do solfège===
In &quot;Fixed do&quot;, each syllable always corresponds to the same pitch; when the music changes keys, each syllable continues to refer to the same sound (in the absolute sense) as it did before. This is analogous to the Romance-language system naming pitches after the solfège syllables, and is used in Romance and Slavic countries, among others, including Spanish-speaking countries.

From the Italian Renaissance, the debate over the superiority of instrumental music versus singing led Italian voice teachers to use Guido’s syllables for vocal technique rather than pitch discrimination. Hence, specific syllables were associated with fixed pitches. When the Paris Conservatoire was founded at the turn of the nineteenth century, its solfège textbooks adhered to the conventions of Italian solfeggio, solidifying the use of &quot;Fixed doh&quot; in Romance cultures

In the major Romance and Slavic languages, the syllables Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and Si are the ordinary names of the notes, in the same way that the letters C, D, E, F, G, A, and B are used to name notes in English. For native speakers of these languages, solfège is simply &quot;singing the names of the notes&quot;, omitting any modifiers such as &quot;sharp&quot; or &quot;flat&quot; to preserve the rhythm. This system is called fixed do and is used in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Romania, Latin American countries and in French-speaking Canada as well as countries such as Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Israel where non-Romance languages are spoken. In the United States, the fixed-do system is taught at many conservatories and schools of music including The Juilliard School in New York City, the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music in San Francisco, California, and the Cleveland Institute of Music in Cleveland, Ohio.

In the fixed do system, shown above, accidentals do not affect the syllables used. For example, C, C, and C (as well as and , not shown above) are all sung with the syllable &quot;do&quot;.

====Chromatic variants====
Several chromatic fixed-do systems have also been devised to account for chromatic notes, and even for double-sharp and double-flat variants. The Yehnian system, being the first 24-EDO (i.e., quarter tone) solfège system, proposed even quartertonal syllables. While having no exceptions to its rules, it supports both si and ti users.

==Note names==
In the countries with fixed-do, these seven syllables (with &quot;si&quot; rather than &quot;ti&quot;) – and not the letters C, D, E, F, G, A, and B – are used to name the notes of the C-Major scale. Here it would be said, for example, that Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony (in D minor) is in &quot;Re minor&quot;, and that its third movement (in B-flat major) is in &quot;Si-bemol major&quot;.

In Germanic countries, on the other hand, the notes have letter names that are mainly the same as those used in English (so that Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony is said to be in &quot;d-Moll&quot;), and solfège syllables are encountered only in sight-singing and ear training.

==Cultural references==
* The various possibilities to distinguish the notes acoustically, optically and by ways of speech and signs, made the solfège a possible syllabary for an International Auxiliary Language (IAL/LAI). This was, in the latter half of the 19th century, realised in the musical language Solresol.
* In &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, the song &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot; is built around solfège. Maria sings it with the von Trapp children to teach them to sing the major scale.
* Ernie Kovacs&#x27; television show had a popular recurring sketch that became known as &quot;The Nairobi Trio&quot;. The three characters wore long overcoats, bowler hats, and gorilla masks, and were performed by Ernie and two other rotating persons including uncredited stars such as Frank Sinatra and Jack Lemmon, as well as Kovacs&#x27; wife, singer Edie Adams. There was no dialog, the three pantomimed to the song Solfeggio by Robert Maxwell and the lyrics of the song were made up solely of the solfeggio syllables themselves. The sketch was so popular, that the song was re-released as &quot;Song of the Nairobi Trio&quot;.

<text>The Ruhr is a river in western Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia), a right tributary (east-side) of the Rhine.

==Description and history==
The source of the Ruhr is near the town of Winterberg in the mountainous Sauerland region, at an elevation of approximately . It flows into the lower Rhine at an elevation of only in the municipal area of Duisburg. Its total length is , its average discharge is at Mülheim near its mouth. Thus, its discharge is, for example, comparable to that of the river Ems in Northern Germany or the River Thames in the United Kingdom.

The Ruhr first passes the towns of Meschede, Arnsberg, Wickede, Fröndenberg, Holzwickede, Iserlohn, and Schwerte. Then the river marks the southern limit of the Ruhr area, passing Hagen, Dortmund, Herdecke, Wetter, Witten, Bochum, Hattingen, Essen, Mülheim, and Duisburg.

The Ruhr area was Germany&#x27;s primary industrial area during the early- to mid-20th century. Most factories were located there. The occupation of the Ruhr from 1923 to 1924 by French forces, due to the Weimar Republic&#x27;s failure to continue paying reparations from World War I, provoked passive resistance, which saw production in the factories grind to a halt. As a result, the German hyperinflation crisis grew even worse.

During World War II, two of the dams on the Ruhr, the Möhne Dam and the Sorpe Dam were targets for Operation Chastise, in which special &quot;bouncing bombs&quot; were developed to take out the dams and flood the valley, with the hope of seriously affecting the German industries there. The story was told in a 1951 book and the popular 1955 film made from it, &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;.

==Lakes==
There are five Ruhr reservoirs on the river, often used for leisure activities.

* Hengsteysee between Dortmund and Hagen, surface area: 1.36 km2, height of the weir 4.5 m
* Harkortsee between Herdecke and Wetter; surface area: 1.37 km2, height of the weir 7.8 m
* Kemnader See between Witten and Bochum; surface area: 1.25 km2, height of the weir 2 m
* Baldeneysee in Essen-Werden; surface area: 2.64 km2, height of the weir 8.5 m
* Kettwiger See in Essen-Kettwig; surface area: 0.55 km2, height of the weir 6 m

==Tributaries==
The main tributaries of the Ruhr are (from source to mouth):

* Left: Berkelbach, Voßmecke, Neger, Elpe, Valme, Nierbach, Henne, Kelbke, Wenne, Mühlenbach, Röhr, Bachumer Bach, Haßbach, Scheebach, Wimberbach, Hönne, Abbabach, Baarbach, Elsebach, Wannebach (Ergste), Lenne, Volme, Sprockhöveler Bach, Deilbach, Oefter Bach, Rinderbach
* Right: Hillebach, Gierskoppbach, Gebke (Meschede), Kleine Gebke, Gebke (Wennemen), Wanne, Möhne, Wannebach (Westhofen), Borbach, Wannenbach, Hörsterholzer Bach, Knöselsbach, Rumbach

<text>The Ruhr ( ; , also &quot;Ruhrpott&quot; ), also referred to as the Ruhr area, sometimes Ruhr district, Ruhr region, or Ruhr valley, is a urban area in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. With a population density of 1,160/km2 and a population of over 5 million (2017), it is the largest urban area in Germany and the third of the European Union. It consists of several large cities bordered by the rivers Ruhr to the south, Rhine to the west, and Lippe to the north. In the southwest it borders the Bergisches Land. It is considered part of the larger Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region of more than 10 million people, which is the third largest in Western Europe, behind only London and Paris.

The Ruhr cities are, from west to east: Duisburg, Oberhausen, Bottrop, Mülheim an der Ruhr, Essen, Gelsenkirchen, Bochum, Herne, Hagen, Dortmund, Hamm and the districts of Wesel, Recklinghausen, Unna and Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis. The most populous cities are Dortmund (with a population of approximately 612,065), Essen (about 583,000) and Duisburg (about 497,000).

In the Middle Ages, the Hellweg was an important trade route from the region of the Lower Rhine to the mountains of the Teutoburg Forest. The most important towns of the region from Duisburg to the imperial city of Dortmund were concentrated along the Hellweg from the Rhineland to Westphalia. Since the 19th century, these cities have grown together into a large complex with a vast industrial landscape, inhabited by some 7.3 million people (including Düsseldorf and Wuppertal, large cities that are nearby but officially not part of the Ruhr area).

The Ruhr area has no administrative centre; each city in the area has its own administration, although there is a supracommunal institution in Essen. For 2010, the Ruhr region was one of the European Capitals of Culture.

== Etymology ==

The 1911 edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; has only one definition of &quot;Ruhr&quot;: &quot;a river of Germany, an important right-bank tributary of the lower Rhine&quot;. The use of the term &quot;Ruhr&quot; for the industrial region started in Britain only after World War I, when French and Belgian troops had occupied the Ruhr district and seized its prime industrial assets in lieu of unpaid reparations in 1923. In 1920, the International Labour Office published a report entitled &quot;Coal Production in the Ruhr District&quot;. In 1923, the &quot;Canadian Commercial Intelligence Journal&quot;, Volume 28, Issue 1013, includes the article, &quot;Exports from the Ruhr district of Germany&quot;. In 1924 the English and American press was still talking of the &quot;French occupation of the Ruhr Valley&quot; or &quot;Ruhr District&quot;. A 62-page publication seems to be responsible for the use of &quot;Ruhr&quot; as a short form of the then more common &quot;Ruhr District&quot; or &quot;Ruhr Valley&quot;: Ben Tillett, A. Creech-Jones and Samuel Warren&#x27;s &quot;The Ruhr: The Report of a Deputation from the Transport and General Workers Union&quot; (London 1923). Yet &quot;The report of a deputation from the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union which spent a fortnight examining the problems in the Ruhr Valley&quot;, published in &quot;The Economic Review&quot;, Volume 8, 1923, is still using the traditional term. In the same year, &quot;Objections by the United States to discriminatory regulations on exports from the occupied region of the Ruhr&quot; was published in &quot;Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States&quot;.

The 1926 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, in addition to its article on the river Ruhr, has a further article on &quot;RUHR, the name given to a district of Westphalia, Germany&quot;. Thus the name &quot;Ruhr&quot; was given to the region (as a short form of &quot;Ruhr District&quot; or &quot;Ruhr Valley&quot;) only a few years before the publication of this edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. Even after World War II, the term &quot;Ruhr&quot; may not have been in general use for the region: it was defined in &quot;Documents on American Foreign Relations&quot; (1948): &quot;For the purposes of the present Agreement: (i) the expression &#x27;Ruhr&#x27; means the areas, as presently constituted, in Land North Rhine–Westphalia, listed in the Annex to this Agreement.&quot; However, Lawrence K. Cecil and Philip Hauge Abelson still write in 1967: &quot;In the first place, the average person uses the term &#x27;Ruhr&#x27; indiscriminately as the Ruhr River or the Ruhr district, two entirely different things. The Ruhr River is only one of half a dozen rivers in the Ruhr district, in addition to the Rhine. The Rhine itself runs through the heart of the Ruhr district.&quot; According to &quot;Merriam Webster&#x27;s Geographical Dictionary&quot;, a standard reference on place names around the world, the name &quot;Ruhr&quot; refers to the river. The name preferred for the region in this dictionary is &quot;Ruhrgebiet&quot;, followed by &quot;Ruhr Valley&quot;.

==Geography==
The urban landscape of the Ruhr extends from the Lower Rhine Basin east to the Westphalian Plain and south to the hills of the Rhenish Massif. Through the centre of the Ruhr runs a segment of the loess belt that extends across Germany from west to east. Historically, this loess belt has underlain some of Germany&#x27;s richest agricultural regions.

Geologically, the region is defined by coal-bearing layers from the upper Carboniferous period. The coal seams reach the surface in a strip along the river Ruhr and dip downward from the river to the north. Beneath the Lippe, the coal seams lie at a depth of 600 to 800 metres (2,000 to 2,600 feet). The thickness of the coal layers ranges from one to three metres (three to ten feet). This geological feature played a decisive role in the development of coal mining in the Ruhr.

According to the Regionalverband Ruhr (RVR, Ruhr Regional Association), 37.6% of the region&#x27;s area is built up. A total of 40.7% of the region&#x27;s land remains in agricultural use. Forests account for 17.6%, and bodies of water and other types of land use occupy the rest. The inclusion of four mainly rural districts in the otherwise mainly industrial Ruhr helps to explain the large proportion of agricultural and forested land. In addition, the city boroughs of the Ruhr region have outlying districts with a rural character.

Seen on a map, the Ruhr could be considered a single city, since there are no visible breaks between the individual city boroughs. Thus the Ruhr is described as a polycentric urban area, which shares a similar history of urban and economic development.

Because of its history, the Ruhr is structured differently from monocentric urban regions such as Munich, which developed through the rapid absorption of smaller towns and villages by the most significant city among them. Instead in the Ruhr, the individual city boroughs and urban districts of the Ruhr grew in a rapid and parallel fashion independently of one another during the Industrial Revolution. The population density of the central Ruhr is about 2,100 inhabitants per square kilometre (about 5,400 per square mile)—not too high compared to other German cities.

Between the constituent urban areas are relatively open suburbs and even some open land with agricultural fields. In many places however, the borders between cities in the central Ruhr are unrecognizable, blending into one urban landscape due to continuous development across them.

The replanting of brownfield land has created new parks and recreation areas in recent decades. The Emscher Landschaftspark (Emscher Landscape Park) lies along the river Emscher, formerly virtually an open sewer, parts of which have undergone natural restoration. This park connects strips of parkland running from north to south, which were developed through regional planning in the 1920s, to form a green belt between the Ruhr cities from east to west.

==History==

During the Middle Ages, much of the region that was later called the &quot;Ruhrgebiet&quot; was situated in the County of Mark, the Duchies of Cleves and Berg and the territories of the bishop of Münster and the archbishop of Cologne. The region included some villages and castles, and was mainly agrarian: its loess soil made it one of the richer parts of western Germany. The free imperial city of Dortmund was the trading and cultural centre, lying on the Hellweg, an important east–west trading route, that also brought prosperity to the town of Duisburg. Both towns were members of the Hanseatic League.

===Industrial revolution===
The development of the region into an urbanized industrial area started in the late 18th century with the early industrialisation in the nearby Wupper Valley in the Bergisches Land. By around 1820, hundreds of water-powered mills were producing textiles, lumber, shingles and iron in automated processes here. In additional workshops in the hills, highly skilled workers manufactured knives, tools, weapons and harnesses, using water, coal and charcoal.

As the machines became bigger and moved from water power to steam power, locally mined coal and charcoal became expensive and there was not enough of it. The Bergische industry ordered more and more coal from the new coal mining area along the Ruhr. Impressive and expensive railways were constructed through the hilly Wupper region, to bring coal, and later steel, in from the Ruhr, and for outward transport of finished products.


By 1850, there were almost 300 coal mines in operation in the Ruhr area, in and around the central cities of Duisburg, Essen, Bochum and Dortmund. The coal was exported or processed in coking ovens into coke, used in blast furnaces, producing iron and steel. In this period the name &quot;Ruhrgebiet&quot; became common. Before the coal deposits along the Ruhr were exhausted, the mining industry moved northward to the Emscher and finally to the Lippe, drilling ever deeper mines as it went. Locks built at Mülheim on the Ruhr led to the expansion of Mülheim as a port. With the construction of the Cologne-Minden railway in the late 19th century, several iron works were built within the borders of the present-day city of Oberhausen.

Moreover, the urbanization also boosted the expansion of railroad connections. At the beginning of the 1880s, agricultural regions did not benefit from the newly built transport facilities as much as non-agricultural regions did. This in its turn increased inequality, and made anthropometric measurements, e.g. height, more dependent on wages. In the long run, however, effects of the railroad proximity diminished.

Consequently, the population climbed rapidly. Towns with only 2,000 to 5,000 people in the early 19th century grew in the following 100 years to over 100,000. Skilled mineworkers were recruited from other regions to the Ruhr&#x27;s mines and steel mills and unskilled people started to move in. From 1860 onwards there was large-scale migration of Polish speakers from Silesia, Pomerania, East Prussia and Posen to the Ruhr, who were known as &quot;Ruhrpolen&quot; since. The Poles were treated as second class citizens. In 1899 this led to a revolt in Herne of young Polish workers, who later established a Workers&#x27; Union. Skilled workers in the mines were often housed in &quot;miners&#x27; colonies&quot;, built by the mining firms. By 1870, over 3 million people lived in the Ruhrgebiet and the new coal-mining district had become the largest industrial region of Europe.

During World War I the Ruhrgebiet functioned as Germany&#x27;s central weapon factory. At a big Essen company, F. Krupp A.G., the number of employees rose from 40,000 to 120,000 or more, in four years. They were partly women, partly forced labourers.

===Weimar Republic===
In the March 1920 Kapp Putsch, nationalist and monarchist elements with the armed support of Freikorps units attempted to overthrow the government of the Weimar Republic. It was able to defeat the putsch by advocating a general strike that all but shut down Berlin. The work action effectively ended the putsch, but in the Ruhr it was the instigation for an armed revolt whose aim was to replace the Weimar Republic with a soviet-style council republic. In the Ruhr Uprising, the Ruhr Red Army was able to take control of the Ruhr industrial area. The Reichswehr, with assistance from Freikorps units, put down the rebellion in early April 1920 and re-established the Weimar Republic&#x27;s control of the district. An estimated 1,000 insurgents and 200 Reichswehr soldiers were killed in the battles.

In March 1921, French and Belgian troops occupied Duisburg, which under the Treaty of Versailles formed part of the demilitarized Rhineland. In January 1923 the whole Ruhr district was occupied after Germany failed to fulfill part of its World War I reparation payments as agreed in the Versailles Treaty. The German government responded with a policy of passive resistance, letting workers and civil servants refuse orders and instructions by the occupation forces. Production and transport came to a standstill and the financial consequences contributed to German hyperinflation. After passive resistance was called off in late 1923, Germany implemented a currency reform and negotiated the Dawes Plan, which led to the withdrawal of the French and Belgian troops from the Ruhr in 1925. However, the occupation of the Ruhr caused several direct and indirect consequences to the German economy and government, including accelerating the growth of right wing parties due to the Weimar government&#x27;s inability to successfully resolve the problem.

===Nazi period===
On 7 March 1936, Adolf Hitler took a massive gamble by sending 30,000 troops into the Rhineland. As Hitler and other Nazis admitted, the French army alone could have destroyed the Wehrmacht. The French passed the problem to the British, who found that the Germans had the right to &quot;enter their own backyard&quot;, and no action was taken. In the League of Nations, the Soviet delegate Maxim Litvinov was the only one who proposed economic sanctions against Germany. All restraint on German rearmament was now removed. France&#x27;s eastern allies (the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia) concluded that since the French refused to defend their own border, they certainly would not stand up for their allies in the East. Hitler could now continue eroding the alliance system that France had built since 1919. On 16 October 1936, Belgium repudiated the 1921 alliance with France and declared its absolute neutrality. In October 1937, Belgium signed a non-aggression pact with Germany.
During World War II, the bombing of the Ruhr in 1940–1944 caused a loss of 30% of plant and equipment (compared to 15–20% for German industry as a whole). A second battle of the Ruhr (6/7 October 1944 – end of 1944) began with an attack on Dortmund. The devastating bombing raids of Dortmund on 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft – 748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos – was a record to a single target in the whole of World War II. More than 4,800 tons of bombs were dropped through the city centre and the south of the city.

In addition to the strategic bombing of the Ruhr, in April 1945, the Allies trapped several hundred thousand Wehrmacht troops in the Ruhr Pocket.
===Postwar period===
After the war, the region fell within the British occupation zone, and Level of Industry plans for Germany abolished all German munitions factories and civilian industries that could support them and severely restricted civilian industries of military potential. The Ruhr Authority, an international body to regulate the Ruhr&#x27;s coal and steel industries, was created as a condition for the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany.

During the Cold War, the Western allies anticipated that any Red Army thrust into Western Europe would begin in the Fulda Gap and have the Ruhr as a primary target. Increased German control of the area was limited by the pooling of German coal and steel into the multinational European Coal and Steel Community in 1951. The nearby Saar region, containing much of Germany&#x27;s remaining coal deposits, was handed over to economic administration by France as a protectorate in 1947 and did not politically return to Germany until January 1957, with economic reintegration occurring two years later. Parallel to the question of political control of the Ruhr, the Allies tried to decrease German industrial potential by limitations on production and dismantling of factories and steel plants, predominantly in the Ruhr. By 1950, after the virtual completion of the by-then much watered-down &quot;level of industry&quot; plans, equipment had been removed from 706 manufacturing plants in the west, and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6.7 million tons. Dismantling finally ended in 1951. In all, less than 5% of the industrial base was dismantled.

The Ruhr was at the centre of the German economic miracle Wirtschaftswunder of the 1950s and 1960s, as very rapid economic growth (9% a year) created a heavy demand for coal and steel.

After 1973, Germany was hard hit by a worldwide economic crisis, soaring oil prices, and increasing unemployment, which jumped from 300,000 in 1973 to 1.1 million in 1975. The Ruhr region was hardest hit, as the easy-to-reach coal mines became exhausted, and German coal was no longer competitive. Likewise the Ruhr steel industry went into sharp decline, as its prices were undercut by lower-cost suppliers such as Japan. The welfare system provided a safety net for the large number of unemployed workers, and many factories reduced their labor force and began to concentrate on high-profit specialty items.

As demand for coal decreased after 1958, the area went through phases of structural crisis (see steel crisis) and industrial diversification, first developing traditional heavy industry, then moving into service industries and high technology. The air and water pollution of the area are largely a thing of the past although some issues take a long time to solve. In 2005 Essen was the official candidate for nomination as European Capital of Culture for 2010.

==Climate==
The Ruhr has an oceanic climate in spite of its inland position, with winds from the Atlantic travelling over the lowlands to moderate temperature extremes, in spite of its relatively northerly latitude that sees significant variety in daylight hours. A consequence of the marine influence is a cloudy and wet climate with low sunshine hours. Summers normally average in the low 20s, with winters being somewhat above the freezing point.


==Demographics==
The ten largest cities of the Ruhr:

The local regiolect of German is commonly called &quot;Ruhrdeutsch&quot; (&quot;Ruhrgebietsdeutsch, Ruhrpottdeutsch, Ruhrpottisch, Ruhrpöttisch&quot;) although there is really no uniform regiolect that justifies designation as a &quot;single&quot; regiolect. It is rather a working-class sociolect with influences from the various dialects found in the area and changing even with the professions of the workers. A major common influence stems from the coal mining tradition of the area. For example, quite a few locals prefer to call the Ruhr either &quot;Pott&quot;, which is a derivate of &quot;Pütt&quot; (pitmen&#x27;s term for &quot;mine&quot;; cp. the English &quot;pit&quot;), or &quot;Revier&quot;.

During the nineteenth century, the Ruhr attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia in a migration known as &quot;Ostflucht&quot; (flight from the east). By 1925, the Ruhrgebiet had around 3,800,000 inhabitants. Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. It has been claimed that immigrants came to the Ruhr from over 140 countries. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a first language, and for various reasons, they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often their Polish family names only remain as a sign of their past.

==Culture==

== Education ==

With 22 universities and colleges and more than 250,000 students, the Ruhr region has the highest density of further education establishments anywhere in Germany. These include five universities alone in the cities of Bochum, Duisburg, Dortmund, Essen and Witten. In addition, Folkwang University of the Arts is an internationally acclaimed art college with its base in the Ruhr region. Furthermore, the universities are not the only places in the Ruhr region where academic qualifications can be obtained. There are 17 different universities of applied sciences which offer students to have the opportunity to undertake practice-relevant and qualified studies in various subjects, such as economics, logistics, administration or management.

==Transport==
===Public transport===
With the exception of public transport companies serving Hamm and Kreis Unna, all such companies in the Ruhr region are run under the umbrella of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr, which provides a uniform ticket system valid for the entire area. The Ruhr region is well-integrated into the national rail system, the Deutsche Bahn, for both passenger and goods services, each city in the region has at least one train station. The bigger central stations have hourly direct connections to the bigger European cities as Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, Vienna or Zürich.

The Ruhr area also contains the longest tram system in the world, with tram and Stadtbahn services from Witten to Krefeld as well as the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn network.
Originally the system was even bigger, it was possible to travel from Unna to Bad Honnef without using railway or bus services.

===Road transport===
The Ruhr has one of the densest motorway networks in all of Europe, with dozens of Autobahns and similar Schnellstraßen (expressways) crossing the region. The Autobahn network is built in a grid network, with four east–west (A2, A40, A42, A44) and seven north–south (A1, A3, A43, A45, A52, A57, A59) routes. The A1, A2 and A3 are mostly used by through traffic, while the other autobahns have a more regional function.

Both the A44 and the A52 have several missing links, in various stages of planning. Some missing sections are currently in construction or planned to be constructed in the near future.

Additional expressways serve as bypasses and local routes, especially around Dortmund and Bochum. Due to the density of the autobahns and expressways, Bundesstraßen are less important for intercity traffic. The first Autobahns in the Ruhr opened during the mid-1930s. Due to the density of the network, and the number of alternative routes, traffic volumes are generally lower than other major metropolitan areas in Europe. Traffic congestion is an everyday occurrence, but far less so than in the Randstad in the Netherlands, another polycentric urban area. Most important Autobahns have six lanes, but there are no eight-lane Autobahns in the Ruhr.

===Air transport===
Düsseldorf Airport is the intercontinental airport for North Rhine-Westphalia and is within 20 km of most of the Western Ruhr area.
It is served by the Düsseldorf Flughafen and Düsseldorf Flughafen Terminal railway stations, with its several parking lots, terminals and stations being connected by the &quot;Skytrain&quot;.

Dortmund Airport in the Eastern Ruhr is a mid-sized airport, offering scheduled flights to domestic and European destinations and its approximately 3 million passengers in 2023. Dortmund Airport is served by an express bus to Dortmund main station, a shuttle bus to the nearby railway station &quot;Holzwickede/Dortmund Flughafen&quot;, a bus connecting to Stadtbahn line U47, as well as a bus to the city of Unna.

<text>The London Borough of Bromley () is a borough in London, England. It borders the county of Kent, of which it formed part until 1965. The borough&#x27;s population in the 2021 census was 329,991. It is named after Bromley, its principal district. Other districts are Penge, Hayes, West Wickham, Chislehurst, Beckenham and Orpington. The local authority is Bromley London Borough Council.

==Geography==
The borough is the largest in Greater London by area and occupies . The majority of the borough is Metropolitan Green Belt, including nearly all of the land south of the A232-A21 route between West Wickham and Pratt&#x27;s Bottom. Consequently, it is also perhaps the most rural borough and contains more of the North Downs than any other, as that escarpment is broad between Bromley and Banstead. This is also reflected in its population density, which is the lowest of the 32 London boroughs.

Most of the population lives in the north and west of the borough, with an outlier at Biggin Hill in the far south. The borough shares borders with the London Boroughs of Lewisham and Greenwich to the north, Bexley to the north-east, Southwark and Lambeth to the north-west, and Croydon to the west. It also borders the Sevenoaks District of Kent to the east and south, and the Tandridge District of Surrey to the south-west.

Westerham Heights, the highest point in London and Kent at an altitude of , is on the southern boundary. The Prime Meridian passes through Bromley.

About 30% of the land in Bromley is farmland, the highest figure of a London borough.

==History==
A local government district called Bromley was created in 1867, covering the parish of Bromley. The neighbouring parish of Beckenham was also made a local government district in 1878. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Other urban districts were subsequently created for Penge and Chislehurst in 1900, and Orpington in 1934.

Bromley was incorporated to become a municipal borough in 1903, as was Beckenham in 1935. Chislehurst Urban District merged with the neighbouring Sidcup Urban District in 1934.

The modern borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former Municipal Borough of Bromley, Municipal Borough of Beckenham, Orpington Urban District, Penge Urban District and the Chislehurst area from the Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District (the Sidcup area went to the London Borough of Bexley). Penge Urban District was the only part of the new borough which had been within the boundaries of the London County Council and Metropolitan Board of Works, voting to leave in 1899 to become self-governing until 1965. The area was transferred from Kent to Greater London, to become one of the 32 London boroughs.

In 1969, after a local campaign, the village of Knockholt was removed from the borough and transferred to the neighbouring Sevenoaks Rural District; before 1965, it had been part of the Orpington Urban District. Knockholt railway station however remains in Orpington. 

==Districts==
The borough is partly urban and partly rural, the former to the north and very much part of the built-up area of suburban London.

The principal parts of the northern section, from west to east, are Beckenham, which includes Eden Park and Elmers End; Bromley with Bickley, Bromley Park and Bromley Common, Park Langley, Plaistow, Shortlands and Southborough; Chislehurst, with Elmstead and Sundridge. The built-up area around Orpington not only encompasses its direct outskirts of Chelsfield, Crofton, Derry Downs, Goddington, Kevingtown, and Petts Wood; it also includes the erstwhile separate settlements of Farnborough, Green Street Green, Pratt&#x27;s Bottom, St Mary Cray and St Paul&#x27;s Cray. Other smaller suburban areas include Penge, Anerley, and parts of nearby Crystal Palace including its park. In addition, parts of Mottingham, Sydenham, Swanley and Ruxley lie within the borough boundaries.

There are two main built-up areas in the southern part of the borough: Hayes and West Wickham. Biggin Hill, Downe and Keston with Leaves Green and Nash are separate, smaller, rural settlements.

Local attractions include Down House (the home of Charles Darwin), Chislehurst Caves, Holwood House (the home of William Pitt the Younger), Crofton Roman Villa, and the site of The Crystal Palace.

==Governance==
The local authority is Bromley Council, based at the Civic Centre at Bromley Palace.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the Bexley and Bromley constituency.

==Demographics==

In 1801, the civil parishes that form the modern borough had a total population of 8,944. This rose slowly throughout the nineteenth century, as the district became built up; reaching 17,192 in the middle of the century. When the railways arrived, the rate of population growth increased. The population peaked in the 1970s, when industry began to relocate from London.

The most recent 2021 United Kingdom census the borough showed a total population of 329,991, up from 309,392 in 2011.
All major religions are represented, but of those stating a choice, 48.3% described themselves as Christian down from 60.7% in 2011.

In 2001, of the population, 43.47% were in full-time employment and 11.06% in part-time employment – compared to a London average of 42.64% and 8.62%, respectively. Residents were predominantly owner-occupiers, with 32.53% owning their house outright, and a further 42.73% owning with a mortgage. Only 1.42% were in local authority housing, with a further 12.74% renting from a housing association, or other registered social landlord.

A study in 2017 showed that Bromley had the second lowest poverty rate (15%) of any London borough.

<text>The London Borough of Bexley () is a London borough in south-east London, forming part of Outer London. It has a population of 248,287. The main settlements are Sidcup, Erith, Bexleyheath, Crayford, Welling and Old Bexley. The London Borough of Bexley is within the Thames Gateway, an area designated as a national priority for urban regeneration. The local authority is Bexley London Borough Council.

==History==
Prior to the 19th century the area now forming the borough was sparsely populated: very few of the present settlements were mentioned in the Domesday Book, although the village of Bexley has a charter dated 814 AD. Erith was a port on the River Thames until the 17th century; the opening of the sewage works at nearby Crossness in the late 19th century turned it into an industrial town.

Today&#x27;s settlement pattern is the result of the gradual extension of the London influence. Until the 19th century it was an area with a few isolated buildings such as the Georgian Danson House. With the coming of the railways building began apace, although the area is still composed of many disconnected settlements, interspersed with area of open ground and parks.

===Administrative history===
A local government district called Bexley was created in 1880, covering the parish of Bexley, which included both Bexley village and Bexleyheath. Another local government district had been created covering the neighbouring parish of Erith in 1876. Such districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

Bexley Urban District absorbed the neighbouring parish of East Wickham in 1902; Welling had previously straddled the boundary between Bexley and East Wickham, but after 1902 was therefore wholly in Bexley. Crayford was made an urban district in 1920. Bexley was made a municipal borough in 1935, as was Erith in 1938.

The modern borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former boroughs of Bexley and Erith, the Crayford Urban District and the Sidcup area from the Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District (the Chislehurst area went to the London Borough of Bromley). The area was transferred from Kent to Greater London, to become one of the 32 London boroughs.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the borough depicts symbols for the main rivers in the area, the Bexley Charter Oak, the industry and the Kent boundary.

==Governance==
===Bexley London Borough Council===

The local authority is Bexley Council, which has its headquarters at the Bexley Civic Offices in Bexleyheath.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the Bexley and Bromley constituency.

==Geography==
Bexley, lying as it does on the outer fringe of London, has many relatively large areas of open space. The ridge of higher ground in South London crosses the Borough from its high point of Shooters Hill, on the boundary with the Royal Borough of Greenwich, to end above the River Thames at Belvedere, where the land drops down to the old port of Erith. This high land, whose geology is the sand and pebbles of the &quot;Blackheath beds&quot;, and which results in heathland, provided a natural course for the old Roman road of Watling Street, which ran between Crayford and Welling. The land falls away to the north of the high ground, across the Erith Marshes to the River Thames, which here makes a loop to the north at Crossness. There is a further ridge of less higher ground from the west terminating at Sidcup.

Apart from the River Thames the other rivers within the Borough are the River Darent, which, with its tributary the River Cray and the smaller &quot;Stanham River&quot;, all form part of its north-eastern boundary; and the River Shuttle, a tributary of the Cray.

The major centres of settlement can be considered in two parts: the older established erstwhile villages; and the infill areas of suburban houses and centres. Among the former are Erith, in the 17th century a port on the Thames, and an industrial town in the later 19th century; Bexleyheath, created at the same time on the London to Dover road. By the earlier 20th century, both were created Urban District Councils (UDC), as was Foots Cray (an ancient village site). Thamesmead, the &quot;new town&quot; built on what was the Erith Marshes, extends into the Borough: both Thamesmead North and South are located here. Crayford was mentioned in the Domesday Book, and its parish later included the hamlets of North End and Slade Green.

Other settlements include Welling, which has a higher population than Bexleyheath, a staging post on the Dover Road, which was at one time of less importance than the nearby East Wickham (also an ancient village), was absorbed in Bexley UDC. Barnes Cray and North Cray were two hamlets in the Cray Valley; and Belvedere was the location of a medieval monastery.

The map of Bexley shows that a large proportion of its area comprises suburbia. Some named places, like Albany Park and Barnehurst, are names given to developments engendered by the building of the railways. Some came into being when large estates and farmland were broken up for the sole purpose of suburban building: these include Blackfen, Lamorbey and part of Falconwood. Others simply reflect the nature of area: Lessness Heath; Longlands (part of Sidcup); Northumberland Heath and West Heath.

The borough has boundaries with the London Borough of Bromley to the south and the Royal Borough of Greenwich to the west; across the River Thames to the north it borders the London Borough of Havering and London Borough of Barking and Dagenham; there is a short boundary with the unitary authority of Thurrock in Essex to the northeast. There are boundaries with the Borough of Dartford to the east and Sevenoaks district to the southeast, both in the county of Kent.

===Open Spaces===

Despite the suburbia mentioned above, there are still open spaces among the borough&#x27;s streets and avenues. The Borough owns and maintains over one hundred parks and open spaces, large and small; and there is still a part of the Erith Marshes bordering the River Thames. The Crayford Marshes lie to the east of that river, as do &quot;Foots Cray Meadows&quot; further south.

The largest of the open spaces are Foots Cray Meadows, Lesnes Abbey Woods, Danson Park and Hall Place Gardens. There are also many golf courses and sports fields, particularly to the west of Crayford.

===Hall Place===

Hall Place is a former stately home, today a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument, beside the River Cray on the outskirts of Crayford, south-east of Bexleyheath and north-east of Old Bexley. It is situated just off the A223, Bourne Road, south of Watling Street (A207) and north of the Black Prince interchange of the A2 Rochester Way with the A220.

The house dates back to around 1540 when wealthy merchant Sir John Champneys, Lord Mayor of London in 1534, built himself a country house. In 1649, the house was sold to another wealthy City merchant, Sir Robert Austen (1587–1666), who added a second wing built of red bricks, doubling the size of the house.

Currently, the building houses a museum of local artefacts, and a history and tourist information centre. In the gardens there is a topiary lawn, herb garden, tropical garden and long herbaceous cottage garden-styled borders. The former walled gardens include a tropical house housing plants and a large vegetable garden. Model gardens have been created to show visitors how to make use of space in small urban gardens. Hall Place also has three galleries inside the house, presenting art exhibitions and museum displays.

==Demographics==

In 1801, the civil parishes that form the modern borough had a total population of 4,165. This rose slowly throughout the 19th century, as the district became built up; reaching 10,963 in the middle of the century. When the railways arrived the rate of population growth increased. The population peaked in the 1970s, when industry began to relocate from London.

In the 2001 census, the borough had a population of 218,307; of whom 105,148 were male, and 113,159 female. Of the population, 44.3% were in full-time employment and 11.6% in part-time employment – compared to a London average of 42.6% and 8.6%, respectively. Residents were predominantly owner-occupiers, with 31.7% owning their house outright, and a further 46.5% owning with a mortgage. Only 2.2% were in local authority housing, with a further 11.5% renting from a housing association, or other registered social landlord.
The greater part of the population are nominal Anglicans, but there are a number of Roman Catholic churches and nonconformist congregations. In the 2001 Census, 22.7% of the area&#x27;s population described themselves as non-religious or chose not to state their faith.

Baptists, Plymouth Brethren, and Methodists are among the other congregations. In 2008 the former Crayford Methodist Church was purchased by the North West Kent Muslim Association to become a mosque serving Bexley and Dartford boroughs.

In 2011, 58.1% of Bexley&#x27;s population was between 20 and 64 years old, the lowest percentage in London. 16% of the population was over 65, the third highest behind Bromley and Havering. The average household size is 2.49, up from 2.43 in 2001. The number of households increased by 3.52% to 92,600 between 2001 and 2011, one of the lowest increases in the capital.

In 2011, 62.5% of the borough&#x27;s population identified themselves as Christian, with 24.1% having no religion. Both figures are above London&#x27;s average.

The following table shows the ethnic group of respondents in the 2001 and 2011 census in Bexley.

===Roads and paths===
The principal roads through the Borough include the A2 trunk road; the A20 (Sidcup By-pass) which generally marks its southern boundary; the A207, which is the route of the erstwhile Watling Street; the A206 which takes traffic from Woolwich and Dartford; and the latter&#x27;s newer counterpart, the A2016 through Thamesmead.

There are also some long-distance footpaths in the Borough: among them the Thames Path and the London Outer Orbital Path. Bexley Borough has joined with three other adjoining boroughs to for the South East London Green Chain linking green spaces.

===Rail===
Bexley is not served by any London Underground, Tramlink, Docklands Light Railway or London Overground services. However, since 2022, Elizabeth line services have started to utilise a terminus at Abbey Wood, the entrance to which is in Bexley (due to the borough boundary passing through the site, the station&#x27;s platforms sit within the Royal Borough of Greenwich). There are various proposals to extend either the DLR or London Overground to Thamesmead. There are currently no plans to extend the London Underground into the borough, with the nearest current station being in North Greenwich.

There are three suburban railway lines crossing the Borough which converge at Dartford. The most northerly is the North Kent Line, then the Bexleyheath Line which runs through the centre of the borough and then finally the Dartford Loop Line which runs furthest south. Abbey Wood and Slade Green are also served by Thameslink trains.

The National Rail stations are:

<text>The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham () is a London borough in East London. The borough was created in 1965 as the London Borough of Barking; the name was changed in 1980. It is an Outer London borough and the south is within the London Riverside section of the Thames Gateway; an area designated as a national priority for urban regeneration. At the 2011 census it had a population of 187,000. The borough&#x27;s three main towns are Barking, Chadwell Heath and Dagenham. The local authority is the Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council. Barking and Dagenham was one of six London boroughs to host the 2012 Summer Olympics.

==History==
The London Borough of Barking (as it was originally called) was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former Municipal Borough of Barking and the Municipal Borough of Dagenham, with the exceptions of a small area at Hog Hill from Dagenham which went to Redbridge, and the Gallions Reach area, being the part of Barking west of Barking Creek, which went to Newham. The area was transferred from Essex to Greater London to become one of the 32 London Boroughs. At the time of its creation the combined population of Barking and Dagenham was around 180,000.

The pre-1965 borough of Barking had evolved from the Barking Town local government district, which had been created in 1882 covering the central part of the parish of Barking. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The Barking Town Urban District was incorporated to become a municipal borough in 1931, at which point the name was changed from Barking Town to Barking.

Dagenham was a rural parish with a parish council from 1894, subordinate to the Romford Rural District Council. In 1926 the parish council was replaced when Dagenham was made an urban district; it was made a municipal borough in 1938.

The council changed the London borough&#x27;s name from &#x27;Barking&#x27; to &#x27;Barking and Dagenham&#x27; with effect from 1 January 1980. In 1994, the borough was expanded to cover the part of the Becontree estate that until then had been within the Borough of Redbridge and other areas. The area covered by Mayesbrook Park in the Borough was once part of the historic Manor of Jenkins, seat of the Fanshawe family.

Historic records of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham and predecessor bodies the Borough of Barking and the Borough of Dagenham are held at the Barking and Dagenham Archive Service, Valence House Museum.

There are a total of 52 listed buildings located within the borough&#x27;s boundaries. The Grade I and Grade II* listed buildings in the borough include Eastbury Manor House, the Church of Peter and Paul, Dagenham and Valence House.

==Boundaries==
The borough borders the London Borough of Havering to the east with the River Rom forming part of the boundary. It borders the London Borough of Newham to the west with the River Roding forming much of the border. To the south is the River Thames which forms the borough&#x27;s boundary with the London Borough of Bexley and the Royal Borough of Greenwich. To the north the borough forms a thin protrusion between Havering and the London Borough of Redbridge in order to encompass Chadwell Heath. 530 hectares within the borough are designated as part of the Metropolitan Green Belt.

==Geography==
See List of areas of London

The borough&#x27;s major districts include Barking, Becontree and Dagenham. It borders five other London boroughs: Newham, Redbridge, Havering, and Greenwich and Bexley to the south of the Thames.

Much of the housing of the borough was constructed by the London County Council during the interwar period of 1921–1939. Major settlement of the area, mostly escaping slum conditions in the East End of London, occurred during this period when the new motor and chemical industries such as the Ford Motor Company plant at Dagenham were set up. Since the decline of these industries in the 1980s, employment has shifted towards service sector jobs. There are large areas of logistics and warehouse development around the A13 road. Much of the borough is within the London Riverside area of the Thames Gateway zone and is the site of considerable house building and other development, such as Beam Park. A £500 million budget has been earmarked for redevelopment of the borough&#x27;s principal district of Barking.

==Demographics==

In 1801, the civil parishes that form the modern borough had a total population of 1,937; and the area was characterised by farming, woodland and the fishing fleet at Barking. This last industry employed 1,370 men and boys by 1850, but by the end of the century had ceased to exist; replaced by train deliveries of fresh fish from the East Coast ports. The population rose slowly through the 19th century, as the district became built up; and new industries developed around Barking.

The population rose dramatically between 1921 and 1931, when the London County Council developed the Becontree Estate. This public housing development of 27,000 homes housed over 100,000 people, split between the then urban district councils of Ilford, Dagenham and Barking. People were rehoused from the slums of the East End. In 1931, the Ford Motor Company relocated to a site at Dagenham, and in 1932 the District line was extended to Upminster; bringing further development to the area.

After World War II, further public housing projects were built to rehouse the many Londoners made homeless in the Blitz. As industry declined during the 1960s, the population entered a long decline, but has now begun to rise again with new housing developments on brownfield sites. In 2013 Barking and Dagenham has England&#x27;s highest fertility rate: 2.58.

At the time of the 2011 census, 49.5% of the borough&#x27;s community identified themselves as white British. Barking and Dagenham has been strongly influenced by immigration, with the white British population having dropped 30.6% from 2001 to 2011 - the second largest decrease in the country, behind neighbouring Newham. The population of non-UK born residents increasing by 205%. The largest decrease of White British occurred in the Longbridge ward (79.8% in 2001 to 35% in 2011), and the Abbey ward, which contains the main Barking area (from 46.2% to 15.8%). The smallest decrease was in the Eastbrook ward. The largest minority communities were of Black and Asian heritage.

Barking and Dagenham had by far the largest decrease of the 65+ population, having dropped almost 20% between 2001 and 2011. There were 69,700 households in the borough in 2011, up 3.6% from 2001. The borough also had the largest proportion of school-age (5-19) population of all the local authorities in England and Wales, 21.4%, at the 2011 census. The borough&#x27;s pre-school (0-4) population rose by 49.1% from 2001 to 2011, by far the largest increase in London.

<text>Lewisham ( ) is a London borough in south-east London, England. It forms part of Inner London. The principal settlement of the borough is Lewisham. The local authority is Lewisham London Borough Council, based in Catford. The Prime Meridian passes through Lewisham. Blackheath, Goldsmiths, University of London and Millwall F.C. are located within the borough.

== History ==
The modern borough broadly corresponds to the area of the ancient parishes of Lee and Lewisham, plus the later parish of Deptford St Paul, created in 1730 when the ancient parish of Deptford was subdivided. (The other Deptford parish created in 1730, Deptford St Nicholas, went instead to the borough of Greenwich.) Most of the area was historically in the county of Kent, although Deptford St Paul straddled the boundary with Surrey, with its chapelry of Hatcham (the area now known as New Cross) being in the latter county. From 1856 the area was governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was established to provide services across the metropolis of London.

In 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works&#x27; area was made the County of London. From 1856 until 1900 the lower tier of local government within the metropolis comprised various parish vestries and district boards. In 1900 the lower tier was reorganised into metropolitan boroughs, two of which were Lewisham (covering the parishes of Lewisham and Lee) and Deptford (covering the parish of Deptford St Paul).

The larger London Borough of Lewisham was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, as an amalgamation of the former area of the metropolitan boroughs of Lewisham and Deptford.

Minor boundary changes have occurred since its creation. The most significant amendments were made in 1996, when the former area of the Royal Docks in Deptford was transferred from the London Borough of Greenwich.

==Geography==
The borough is surrounded by the Royal Borough of Greenwich to the east (where the border runs between Deptford and Horn Park), the London Borough of Bromley to the south (where the border runs between Horn Park and Crystal Palace Park), and the London Borough of Southwark to the west (where the border runs between Crystal Palace Park and Rotherhithe). The River Thames forms a short section of northern boundary with the Isle of Dogs in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Deptford Creek, Pool River, River Quaggy and River Ravensbourne pass through the borough.
Major landmarks include All Saints Church in Blackheath, the Citibank Tower in Lewisham, Dietrich Bonhoeffer Church (Sydenham&#x27;s German Church, technically located in Forest Hill) and the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill. Millwall F.C. are based in the borough, their stadium The Den being located in South Bermondsey.

==Governance==
The local authority is Lewisham Council, based at Lewisham Town Hall and the adjoining Laurence House in the Catford area of the borough. Since 2002 the council has been led by the directly elected Mayor of Lewisham. A speaker fulfils the civic and ceremonial roles previously undertaken by the (non-political) mayor prior to 2002. The current mayor, Brenda Dacres, was the first black woman directly elected mayor in England when elected in March 2024.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the Greenwich and Lewisham constituency.

=== Westminster Parliament ===
The borough includes the constituencies of Lewisham Deptford, Lewisham West and Penge and Lewisham East.

These are the MPs who have represented constituencies covered by the borough since its formation in 1964. Constituencies change their boundaries over time, even where names remain the same.

<text>A crown is a traditional form of head adornment, or hat, worn by monarchs as a symbol of their power and dignity. A crown is often, by extension, a symbol of the monarch&#x27;s government or items endorsed by it. The word itself is used, particularly in Commonwealth countries, as an abstract name for the monarchy itself (and, by extension, the state of which said monarch is head) as distinct from the individual who inhabits it (that is, &quot;The Crown&quot;). A specific type of crown (or coronet for lower ranks of peerage) is employed in heraldry under strict rules. Indeed, some monarchies never had a physical crown, just a heraldic representation, as in the constitutional kingdom of Belgium.

==Variations==
* Costume headgear imitating a monarch&#x27;s crown is also called a crown hat. Such costume crowns may be worn by actors portraying a monarch, people at costume parties, or ritual &quot;monarchs&quot; such as the king of a Carnival krewe, or the person who found the trinket in a king cake.
* The nuptial crown, sometimes called a coronal, worn by a bride, and sometimes the bridegroom, at her wedding is found in many European cultures since ancient times. In the present day, it is most common in Eastern Orthodox cultures. The Eastern Orthodox marriage service has a section called the crowning, wherein the bride and groom are crowned as &quot;king&quot; and &quot;queen&quot; of their future household. In Greek weddings, the crowns are diadems usually made of white flowers, synthetic or real, often adorned with silver or mother of pearl. They are placed on the heads of the newlyweds and are held together by a ribbon of white silk. They are then kept by the couple as a reminder of their special day. In Slavic weddings, the crowns are usually made of ornate metal, designed to resemble an imperial crown, and are held above the newlyweds&#x27; heads by their best men. A parish usually owns one set to use for all the couples that are married there since these are much more expensive than Greek-style crowns. This was common in Catholic countries in the past.
* Crowns are also often used as symbols of religious status or veneration, by divinities (or their representation such as a statue) or by their representatives (e.g., the Black Crown of the Karmapa Lama) sometimes used a model for wider use by devotees. 
* According to the New Testament, a crown of thorns was placed on the head of Jesus before his crucifixion; it has become a common symbol of martyrdom. 
* According to Roman Catholic tradition, the Blessed Virgin Mary was crowned as Queen of Heaven after her assumption into heaven. She is often depicted wearing a crown, and statues of her in churches and shrines are ceremonially crowned during May.
* The Crown of Immortality is also common in historical symbolism.
* The heraldic symbol of Three Crowns, referring to the three evangelical Magi (wise men), traditionally called kings, is believed thus to have become the symbol of the Swedish kingdom, but it also fits the historical (personal, dynastic) Kalmar Union (1397–1520) between the three kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.
* In India, crowns are known as &quot;makuta&quot; (Sanskrit for &quot;crest&quot;), and have been used in India since ancient times and are described adorning Hindu gods or kings. The makuta style was then copied by the Indianized kingdoms that was influenced by Hindu-Buddhist concept of kingship in Southeast Asia, such as in Java and Bali in Indonesia, Cambodia, Burma and Thailand.
* In East Asia, there were crowns such as the Chinese &quot;mianguan&quot; and Japanese &quot;benkan&quot; worn by emperors.
* Dancers of certain traditional Thai dances often wear crowns (&quot;mongkut&quot;) on their head. These are inspired in the crowns worn by deities and by kings.
* In pre-Colonial Philippines crown-like diadems, or &quot;putong&quot;, were worn by elite individuals and deities, among an array of golden ornaments.
* The &quot;shamsa&quot; was a massive, jewel-inlaid ceremonial crown hung by a chain that was part of the regalia of the Abbasid and Fatimid Caliphates.

==Terminology==
Three distinct categories of crowns exist in those monarchies that use crowns or state regalia.

; Coronation: Worn by monarchs when being crowned.
; State: Worn by monarchs on other state occasions.
; Consort crowns: Worn by a consort, signifying rank granted as a constitutional courtesy protocol.

Crowns or similar headgear, as worn by nobility and other high-ranking people below the ruler, are in English often called coronets; however, in many languages, this distinction is not made and the same word is used for both types of headgear (e.g., French &quot;couronne&quot;, German &quot;Krone&quot;, Dutch &quot;kroon&quot;). In some of these languages the term &quot;rank crown&quot; (&quot;rangkroon&quot;, etc.) refers to the way these crowns may be ranked according to hierarchical status.
In classical antiquity, the crown (&quot;corona&quot;) that was sometimes awarded to people other than rulers, such as triumphal military generals or athletes, was actually a wreath or chaplet, or ribbon-like diadem.

==History==
Crowns have been discovered in pre-historic times from Haryana, India. The precursor to the crown was the browband called the diadem, which had been worn by the Achaemenid Persian emperors. It was adopted by Constantine I and was worn by all subsequent rulers of the later Roman Empire.
Almost all Sassanid kings wore crowns. One of the most famous kings who left numerous statues, reliefs, and coins of crowns is the king Shapur I.

Numerous crowns of various forms were used in antiquity, such as the Hedjet, Deshret, Pschent (double crown) and Khepresh of Pharaonic Egypt. The Pharaohs of Egypt also wore the diadem, which was associated with solar cults, an association which was not completely lost, as it was later revived under the Roman Emperor Augustus. By the time of the Pharaoh Amenophis III (r.1390–1352c) wearing a diadem clearly became a symbol of royalty. The wreaths and crowns of classical antiquity were sometimes made from natural materials such as laurel, myrtle, olive, or wild celery.

The &quot;corona radiata&quot;, the &quot;radiant crown&quot; known best on the Statue of Liberty, and perhaps worn by the Helios that was the Colossus of Rhodes, was worn by Roman emperors as part of the cult of Sol Invictus prior to the Roman Empire&#x27;s conversion to Christianity. It was referred to as &quot;the chaplet studded with sunbeams&quot; by Lucian, about 180 AD.
In the Christian tradition of European cultures, where ecclesiastical sanction authenticates monarchic power when a new monarch ascends the throne, the crown is placed on the new monarch&#x27;s head by a religious official in a coronation ceremony. Some, though not all, early Holy Roman Emperors travelled to Rome at some point in their careers to be crowned by the pope. Napoleon, according to legend, surprised Pius VII when he reached out and crowned himself, although in reality this order of ceremony had been pre-arranged.

Today, only the British Monarchy and Tongan Monarchy, with their anointed and crowned monarchs, continue this tradition, although many monarchies retain a crown as a national symbol. The French Crown Jewels were sold in 1885 on the orders of the Third French Republic, with only a token number, their precious stones replaced by glass, retained for historic reasons and displayed in the Louvre. The Spanish Crown Jewels were destroyed in a major fire in the 18th century while the so-called &quot;Irish Crown Jewels&quot; (actually merely the British Sovereign&#x27;s insignia of the Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick) were stolen from Dublin Castle in 1907, just before the investiture of Bernard Edward Barnaby FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown.

The Crown of King George XII of Georgia made of gold and decorated with 145 diamonds, 58 rubies, 24 emeralds, and 16 amethysts. It took the form of a circlet surmounted by ornaments and eight arches. A globe surmounted by a cross rested on the top of the crown.

Special headgear to designate rulers dates back to pre-history, and is found in many separate civilizations around the globe. Commonly, rare and precious materials are incorporated into the crown, but that is only essential for the notion of crown jewels. Gold and precious jewels are common in western and oriental crowns. In the Native American civilizations of the Pre-Columbian New World, rare feathers, such as that of the quetzal, often decorated crowns; so too in Polynesia (e.g., Hawaii).

Coronation ceremonies are often combined with other rituals, such as enthronement (the throne is as much a symbol of monarchy as the crown) and anointing (again, a religious sanction, the only defining act in the Biblical tradition of Israel).

In other cultures, no crown is used in the equivalent of coronation, but the head may still be otherwise symbolically adorned; for example, with a royal &quot;tikka&quot; in the Hindu tradition of India.

==Numismatics==
Because one or more crowns, alone or as part of a more elaborate design, often appear on coins, several monetary denominations came to be known as &#x27;a crown&#x27; or the equivalent word in the local language, such as &quot;krone&quot;. This persists in the case of the national currencies of the Scandinavian countries and the Czech Republic. The generic term &quot;crown sized&quot; is frequently used for any coin roughly the size of an American silver dollar (ie., approximately 26.5mm diameter).

<doc id="95355" wikidata="Q351533" url="?curid=95355" title="Adamawa–Ubangi languages">
<text>The Adamawa–Ubangi languages are a geographic grouping and formerly postulated family of languages spoken in Nigeria, Chad, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan, by a total of about 12 million people.

==History of classification==
The family was proposed by Joseph Greenberg in &quot;The Languages of Africa&quot; under the name Adamawa–Eastern as a primary branch of the Niger–Congo family, which is in turn divided in two branches, Adamawa (e.g. Niellim) and Ubangian (e.g. Azande (Zande language), Ngbandi, on which the creole Sango is based). Kleinewillinghöfer (2014) believes that the Adamawa languages are most closely related to the Gur languages, although the unity of both the Gur and the Adamawa branch is frequently questioned. Roger Blench replaced Adamawa–Ubangi with a Savannas family, which includes Gur, Ubangian and the various branches of Adamawa as primary nodes. Dimmendaal (2008) doubts that Ubangian is a subfamily of Niger–Congo at all, preferring to classify it as an independent family until proven otherwise.

==Demographics==
The Adamawa languages are among the least studied in Africa, and include many endangered languages; by far the largest of the nearly one hundred small Adamawa languages is Mumuye, at 400,000 speakers. A couple of unclassified languages—notably Laal and Jalaa—are found along their fringes. Ubangian languages, while nearly as numerous, are somewhat better studied; one in particular, Sango, a Ngbandi-based creole, has become a major trade language of Central Africa.

==Linguistic features==
Adamawa–Ubangi languages often have partial vowel harmony, involving restrictions on the co-occurrence of vowels in a word.

As in most branches of the Niger–Congo family, noun class systems are widespread. Adamawa–Ubangi languages are notable for having noun class suffixes rather than prefixes. The noun class system is no longer fully productive in all languages.

Adamawa subject pronouns (Boyd 1989) were originally approximately:
*&quot;I&quot;: *&quot;mi&quot; or *&quot;ma&quot;
*&quot;you (sg.)&quot;: *&quot;mo&quot;
*&quot;you (pl.): *&quot;u&quot;, *&quot;ui&quot;, *&quot;i&quot; (+&quot;n&quot;?)

The third person pronouns vary widely.

In possessive constructions, the possessed typically precedes the possessor, and sentence order is usually subject–verb–object.

== Classification ==
In Williamson and Blench (2000), since abandoned, the internal classification was:

<text>A coroner is a government or judicial official who is empowered to conduct or order an inquest into the manner or cause of death. The official may also investigate or confirm the identity of an unknown person who has been found dead within the coroner&#x27;s jurisdiction.

In medieval times, English coroners were Crown officials who held financial powers and conducted some judicial investigations in order to counterbalance the power of sheriffs or bailiffs.

Depending on the jurisdiction, the coroner may adjudge the cause of death personally, or may act as the presiding officer of a special court (a &quot;coroner&#x27;s jury&quot;). The term &quot;coroner&quot; derives from the same source as the word &quot;crown&quot;.

==Duties and functions==
Responsibilities of the coroner may include overseeing the investigation and certification of deaths related to mass disasters that occur within the coroner&#x27;s jurisdiction. A coroner&#x27;s office typically maintains death records of those who have died within the coroner&#x27;s jurisdiction.

The additional roles that a coroner may oversee in judicial investigations may be subject to the attainment of suitable legal and medical qualifications. The qualifications required of a coroner vary significantly between jurisdictions and are described below under the entry for each jurisdiction. Coroners, medical examiners and forensic pathologists are different professions. They have different roles and responsibilities.

==Etymology and history==
The office of coroner originated in medieval England and has been adopted in many countries whose legal systems have at some time been subject to English or United Kingdom law. In Middle English, the word &quot;coroner&quot; referred to an officer of the Crown, derived from the French &quot;couronne&quot; and Latin &quot;corona&quot;, meaning &quot;crown&quot;.

The office of the coroner dates from approximately the 11th century, shortly after the Norman conquest of England in 1066.

The office of coroner was established by &quot;lex scripta&quot; in Richard I&#x27;s England. In September 1194, it was decreed by Article 20 of the &quot;Articles of Eyre&quot; to establish the office of &quot;custos placitorum coronae&quot; (Latin for &quot;keeper of the pleas of the Crown&quot;), from which the word &quot;coroner&quot; is derived. This role provided a local county official whose primary duty was to protect the financial interest of the Crown in criminal proceedings. The office of coroner is, &quot;in many instances, a necessary substitute: for if the sheriff is interested in a suit, or if he is of affinity with one of the parties to a suit, the coroner must execute and return the process of the courts of justice.&quot; This role was qualified in Chapter 24 of Magna Carta in 1215, which states: &quot;No sheriff, constable, coroner or bailiff shall hold pleas of our Crown.&quot; &quot;Keeping the pleas&quot; was an administrative task, while &quot;holding the pleas&quot; was a judicial one that was not assigned to the locally resident coroner but left to judges who traveled around the country holding assize courts. The role of custos rotulorum or keeper of the county records became an independent office, which after 1836 was held by the lord-lieutenant of each county.

The person who found a body from a death thought sudden or unnatural was required to raise the &quot;hue and cry&quot; and to notify the coroner. While coronial manuals written for sheriffs, bailiffs, justices of the peace and coroners were published in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, handbooks specifically written for coroners were distributed in England in the eighteenth century.

Coroners were introduced into Wales following its military conquest by Edward I of England in 1282 through the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284.

Going further back in time, we find that the term comes from antiquity, namely when the deceased was entrusted to the &quot;coronator&quot;, that is to a necrofor who prepared the corpse according to custom and, among other things, put a small laurel or myrtle wreath (Lat. &quot;corona&quot; or &quot;serta&quot;) on his head so that he might be accepted in glory in the afterlife. The use was already of ancient Greece and see e. g. Theophilus Christophorus Harles (&quot;Bionis smyrnaei and Moschi syracusani quae supersunt etc.&quot; P. 40. Erlangen, 1780), who quotes Euripides, Clement of Alexandria, Chionus of Heraclea and others in this regard; see also James Claude Upshaw Downs: &quot;The origin of official death investigation is traced to at least 44 B.C. with the Greek Physician Antistius&#x27;s examination of Julius Caesar&quot; (Fisher 1993; Gawande 2001). &quot;The history of the office of coroner extends well over a millennium and has seen major evolution etc.&quot; (&quot;Coroner and Medical Examiner&quot; in &quot;Handbook of Death and Dying&quot; ed. by Clifton D. Bryant. V. 1, p. 909. 2003.)

==By region==

===Australia===

Australian coroners are responsible for investigating and determining the cause of death for those cases reported to them. In all states and territories, a coroner is a magistrate with legal training, and is attached to a local court. Five states – New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia – also have state coroners and specialised coronial courts. In Tasmania, the Chief Magistrate also acts as the state coroner.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, almost like in the case of medical examiners, such activity has always been privative to physicians, but necessarily policeful, reason why its common denomination, &quot;Médicos-Legistas&quot; (Physician-Legists), is due to such bionicity.

In the Department of Federal Police, according to the National Association of Federal Forensic Experts (&quot;Associação Nacional dos Peritos Criminais Federais – APCF&quot;), &quot;the Federal Forensic Expert is a police officer with technical and scientific knowledge in the service of justice and a professional specialized in finding or providing so-called material evidence through the scientific analysis of traces produced and left in the commission of crimes&quot;, what, in case of the Physician-Legists (inserted in the aforementioned career), applies in relation to highly complex federal crimes involving corpses that need to be examined by the Forensic Medicine and Dentistry Sector linked to the National Institute of Criminalistics.

Throughout the federative units, the Civil Polices (in Federal District and other 8 States) or Scientific Polices (in all other 18 States) disposes of their own Legal-Medical Institutes (mainly responsible for confirming the authorship, dynamics and materiality of offenses involving living beings or their respective corpses) and, with the exception of Paraná, the Physician-Legists constitute a police career of their own.

===Canada===

According to Statistics Canada,

Death investigation is the responsibility of each individual Canadian province and territory—there is no overarching federal authority. As a result, each province and territory has developed their own system and legislation to fulfill the mandate of investigating deaths that are unexpected, unexplained, or as a result of injuries or drugs. Two different death investigation systems have developed in Canada: the Coroner&#x27;s system and the Medical Examiner&#x27;s system. The Coroner&#x27;s system is used in the majority of provinces and territories. It is a system that is centuries old and originated in Great Britain. It is found throughout the world in countries that were former British colonies, including Canada. The Medical Examiner&#x27;s system (used in Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador) is just over one century old and originated in the United States. Although there are some differences between the two systems, the ultimate goal of each is the same—to investigate certain deaths defined in their legislation and establish the identity of the deceased together with the cause of death and the manner of death.

In 21st-century Canada the officer responsible for investigating all unnatural and natural unexpected, unexplained, or unattended deaths goes under the title &quot;coroner&quot; or &quot;medical examiner&quot; depending on location. They do not determine civil or criminal responsibility, but instead make and offer recommendations to improve public safety and prevention of death in similar circumstances.

Coroner or Medical Examiner services are under the jurisdiction of provincial or territorial governments, and in modern Canada generally operate within the public safety and security or justice portfolio. These services are headed by a Chief Coroner (or Chief Medical Examiner) and comprise coroners or medical examiners appointed by the executive council.

The provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador now have a Medical Examiner system, meaning that all death investigations are conducted by specialist physicians trained in Forensic Pathology, with the assistance of other medical and law enforcement personnel. All other provinces run on a coroner system. In Prince Edward Island, and Ontario, all coroners are, by law, physicians.

In the other provinces and territories with a coroner system, namely British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Quebec, New Brunswick, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, coroners are not necessarily physicians but generally have legal, medical, or investigative backgrounds.

===Hong Kong===
The Coroner&#x27;s Court is responsible to inquire into the causes and circumstances of some deaths. The Coroner is a judicial officer who has the power to:
* Grant:
** Burial orders
** Cremation orders
** Waivers of autopsy
** Autopsy orders
** Exhumation orders
** Orders to remove dead bodies outside Hong Kong
* Order police investigations of death
* Order inquests
* Approve removal and use of body parts of the dead body
* Issue certificates of fact of death

The Coroner makes orders after considering the pathologist&#x27;s report.

===Iran===
===Ireland===
The Coroners Service is a network of Coroners situated across Ireland, usually covering areas based on Ireland&#x27;s traditional counties. They are appointed by local authorities as independent experts and must be either qualified doctors or lawyers. Their primary function is to investigate any sudden, unexplained, violent or unnatural death in order to allow a death certificate to be issued. Any death due to unnatural causes will require an inquest to be held.

===New Zealand===
Two coronial services operate in New Zealand. The older one deals only with deaths before midnight of 30 June 2007 that remain under investigation. The new system operates under the Coroners Act 2006, which:
* Established the office of the chief coroner to provide leadership and coordination
* Moved to a smaller number of full-time legally-qualified coroners who are Judges of the Coroners Court
* Ensured families are notified of significant steps in the coronial process
* Introduced wide-ranging cultural matters to be considered in all aspects of dealing with the dead body
* Introduced a specific regime for attention and release of body parts and body samples
* Enhanced inquiry and inquest processes

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Justice appoints &quot;Inquirers into Sudden Deaths&quot; under the &quot;Code of Criminal Procedure&quot; to carry out an inquest into the death of a sudden, unexpected and suspicious nature. Some large cities such as Colombo and Kandy have a City Coroners&#x27; Court attached to the main city hospital, with a Coroner and Additional Coroner.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom a coroner is a specialist judge. Whilst coroners are appointed and paid by local authorities, they are not employees of those local authorities but rather independent judicial office holders who can be removed from office only by the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor. The Ministry of Justice, which is headed by the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, is responsible for coronial law and policy. However it has no operational responsibility for the running of coroners&#x27; courts.

There are separate coroners services for England and Wales and for Northern Ireland. There are no longer coroners in Scotland. Coroners existed in Scotland between about 1400 and 1800 when they ceased to be used. Now deaths requiring judicial examination are reported to the procurator fiscal and dealt with by fatal accident inquiries conducted by the sheriff for the area.

The coroner&#x27;s jurisdiction is limited to determining who the deceased was and how, when and where they came by their death. When the death is suspected to have been either sudden with unknown cause, violent, or unnatural, the coroner decides whether to hold a post-mortem examination and, if necessary, an inquest. The majority of deaths are not investigated by the coroner. If the deceased has been under medical care, or has been seen by a doctor within 14 days of death, then the doctor can issue a death certificate. However, if the deceased died without being seen by a doctor, or if the doctor is unwilling to make a determination, the coroner will investigate the cause and manner of death. The coroner will also investigate when a death is deemed violent or unnatural, where the cause is unknown, where a death is the result of poisoning or industrial injury, or if it occurred in police custody or prison.

The coroner&#x27;s court is a court of law, and accordingly the coroner may summon witnesses. Those found to be lying are guilty of perjury. Additional powers of the coroner may include the power of subpoena and attachment, the power of arrest, the power to administer oaths, and sequester juries of six during inquests.

Any person aware of a dead body lying in the district of a coroner has a duty to report it to the coroner; failure to do so is an offence. This can include bodies brought into England or Wales.

The coroner has a team of coroner&#x27;s officers (previously often ex-police officers, but increasingly from a nursing or other paramedical background) who carry out the investigation on the coroner&#x27;s behalf. A coroner&#x27;s investigation may involve a simple review of the circumstances, ordering a post-mortem examination, or they may decide that an inquest is appropriate. When a person dies in the custody of the legal authorities (in police cells, or in prison), an inquest must be held. In England, inquests are usually heard without a jury (unless the coroner wants one). However, a case in which a person has died under the control of central authority must have a jury, as a check on the possible abuse of governmental power.

Coroners also have a role in treasure cases. This role arose from the ancient duty of the coroner as a protector of the property of the Crown. It is now contained in the Treasure Act 1996. This jurisdiction is no longer exercised by local coroners, but by specialist &quot;coroners for treasure&quot; appointed by the Chief Coroner.

====Inquest conclusions (previously called verdicts)====
The coroner&#x27;s former power to name a suspect in the inquest conclusion and commit them for trial has been abolished. The coroner&#x27;s conclusion sometimes is persuasive for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, but normally proceedings in the coroner&#x27;s court are suspended until after the outcome of any criminal case is known. More usually, a coroner&#x27;s conclusion is also relied upon in civil proceedings and insurance claims. The coroner commonly tells the jury which conclusions are lawfully available in a particular case.

The most common short-form conclusions include:

* Natural causes
* Industrial disease
* Alcohol or drug related
* Suicide
* Accident/misadventure
* Road traffic collision
* Lawful killing
* Open verdict
* Unlawful killing
* Still birth
Alternatively, an inquest may return a narrative conclusion, a brief statement explaining the circumstances how the person came about their death. A coroner giving a narrative conclusion may choose to refer to the other conclusion. A narrative conclusion may also consist of answers to a set of questions posed by the coroner to himself or to the jury (as appropriate).

Lawful killing includes lawful self-defence. There is no material difference between an accidental death conclusion and one of misadventure. Neglect cannot be a conclusion by itself. It must be part of another conclusion. A conclusion of neglect requires that there was a need for relevant care (such as nourishment, medical attention, shelter or warmth) identified, and there was an opportunity to offer or provide that care that was not taken. An open conclusion should only be used as a last resort and is given where the cause of death cannot be identified on the evidence available to the inquest.

Conclusions are arrived at on the balance of probabilities; prior to 2020, conclusions of suicide or unlawful killing were required to be proved to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt.

====England and Wales====

The coroner service in England and Wales is supervised by the Chief Coroner, a judge appointed by the Lord Chief Justice after consulting the Lord Chancellor. The Chief Coroner provides advice, guidance and training to coroners and aims to secure uniformity of practice throughout England and Wales. The post is currently part-time. The present Chief Coroner is Alexia Durran. 

England and Wales are divided into coroner districts by the Lord Chancellor, each district consisting of the area or areas of one or more local authorities. The relevant local authority, with the consent of the Chief Coroner and the Lord Chancellor, must appoint a senior coroner for the district. It must also appoint area coroners (in effect deputies to the senior coroner) and assistant coroners, to the number that the Lord Chancellor considers necessary in view of the physical character and population of the district. The cost of the coroner service for the district falls upon the local authority or authorities concerned, and thus ultimately upon the local inhabitants. There are 98 coroners in England and Wales, covering 109 local authority areas.

To become a coroner in England and Wales the applicant must be a qualified solicitor, barrister, or a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx) with at least five years&#x27; qualified experience. This reflects the role of a coroner: to determine the cause of death of a deceased in cases where the death was sudden, unexpected, occurred abroad, was suspicious in any way, or happened while the person was under the control of central authority (e.g., in police custody). Until 2013 a qualified medical practitioner could be appointed, but that is no longer possible. Any medical coroner still in office will either have been appointed before 2013, or, exceptionally, will hold both medical and legal qualifications.

Formerly, every justice of the High Court was &quot;ex officio&quot; a coroner for every district in England and Wales. This is no longer so; there are now no &quot;ex officio&quot; coroners. A senior judge is sometimes appointed &quot;ad hoc&quot; as a deputy coroner to undertake a high-profile inquest, such as those into the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and the victims of the 2005 London bombings.

====Northern Ireland====
Coronial services in Northern Ireland are broadly similar to those in England and Wales, including dealing with treasure trove cases under the Treasure Act 1996. Northern Ireland has three coroners, who oversee the province as a whole. They are assisted by coroners&#x27; liaison officers and a medical officer.

===United States of America===

, of the 2,342 death investigation offices in the United States, 1,590 were coroners&#x27; offices, 82 of which served jurisdictions of more than 250,000 people. Qualifications for coroners are set by individual states and counties in the U.S. and vary widely. In many jurisdictions, little or no training is required, even though a coroner may overrule a forensic pathologist in naming a cause of death. Some coroners are elected with others appointed. Some coroners hold office by virtue of holding another office. For example, in Nebraska, a county&#x27;s district attorney is also the county&#x27;s coroner. Similarly, in many counties in Texas, the justice of the peace may be in charge of death investigation. In yet other places, the sheriff may be the lawful coroner.

In different jurisdictions the terms &quot;coroner&quot; and &quot;medical examiner&quot; are defined differently. In some places, stringent rules require that the medical examiner be a forensic pathologist. In others, the medical examiner must be a physician, though not necessarily a pathologist nor further specialized forensic pathologist; physicians with no experience in forensic medicine have become medical examiners. In other jurisdictions, such as Wisconsin, each county sets standards, and in some, the medical examiner does not need any medical or educational qualifications.

Not all U.S. jurisdictions use a coroner system for medicolegal death investigation—some operate with only a medical examiner system, while others operate on a mixed coroner–medical examiner system. In the U.S., the terms &quot;coroner&quot; and &quot;medical examiner&quot; vary widely in meaning by jurisdiction, as do qualifications and duties for these offices. Advocates have promoted the medical examiner model as more accurate given the more stringent qualifications.

Local laws define the deaths a coroner must investigate. The most often legally required investigation is for sudden or unexpected deaths, in addition to deaths where no attending physician was present. Additionally, the law often requires investigations for deaths that are suspicious (as defined by jurisdiction) or violent. In several states across the U.S., the coroner has the authority to arrest the county sheriff or assume their duties under certain circumstances. For example, in Indiana, Colorado, Idaho, Kentucky, Ohio, Alabama, and North Carolina, statutes grant coroners these powers, serving as a check on the sheriff&#x27;s authority. In Ohio, the coroner can assume the sheriff’s duties if the sheriff is incapacitated or otherwise unable to act.
====Duties====
Duties always include determining the cause, time and manner of death. The coroner/ME typically uses the same investigatory skills of a police detective because the answers are available from the circumstances, scene, and recent medical records. Many American jurisdictions require that any death not certified by an attending physician be referred to the medical examiner for the location where the death occurred. Only a small percentage of deaths require an autopsy to determine the time, cause and manner of death.

In some states, coroners have additional authority. For example:
* In Louisiana, coroners are involved in the determination of mental illness of living persons.
* In Georgia and Colorado the coroner has the same powers as a county sheriff to execute arrest warrants and to serve process, and is the only county official empowered to arrest the county sheriff; in certain situations where there is no sheriff, the coroner officially acts as sheriff for the county.
* In Kentucky, section 72.415 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes gives coroners and their deputies the full power and authority of peace officers. This includes the power of arrest and the authority to carry firearms.
* In North Carolina, the coroner exists by law in approximately 65 counties, but the office is active in only ten of them; in the counties that have coroners, they are set forth as common law peace officers, yet the coroner of the county also has judicial powers: to investigate cause and manner of death, as in other states, but also to conduct inquests, to issue court orders, to impanel a coroner&#x27;s jury and to act as sheriff in certain cases. She can arrest the sheriff for cause. Beginning in 2015, the NC Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) began optional training for coroners to become special assistant medical examiner investigators (NC CH130A &amp; 152).
* In Indiana, the coroner is the only law enforcement officer who has the authority to arrest and incarcerate the county sheriff and take command of the county jail. The coroner is also the only official who may serve the sheriff with civil process.
* In New York City, the office of coroner was abolished in 1915, since before that time, having medical knowledge was not actually a requirement, leading to much abuse of the position.
* In California, 48 of the 58 counties have merged the county sheriff&#x27;s office and the county coroner&#x27;s office. In these counties, the sheriff also serves as the coroner.

==Notable examples==
* Wynne Edwin Baxter
* Larry Campbell, former provincial coroner for British Columbia
* Thomas Noguchi (born 1927), former Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner for the County of Los Angeles
* Charles Norris
*Paul Revere coroner for Boston
* Morton Shulman, former provincial coroner for Ontario
* William Wynn Westcott
* Athelstan Braxton Hicks, late 19th-century coroner in London and Surrey

==Artistic depictions==

===Film===
* In the song &quot;Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead&quot;, from the classic 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Coroner of Munchkinland confirms the death of the Wicked Witch of the East.

===Literature===

* M. R. Hall is a British crime novelist, who writes a series of best-selling novels featuring Bristol-based coroner, Jenny Cooper.
* Novelist Bernard Knight, a former Home Office pathologist and a professor of forensic pathology at the University of Wales College of Medicine, is well known for his Crowner John Mysteries series set in 12th-century Devon, England. (&quot;Crowner&quot; is an archaic word for &quot;coroner&quot; and is based on the origins of the word. See the History section above.)

===Television===
Although coroners are often depicted in police dramas as a source of information for detectives, there are a number of fictional coroners who have taken particular focus on television.

* Dr. Camille Saroyan is a federal coroner and the head of the Forensic Division at Jeffersonian Institute in the TV series &quot;Bones&quot;.
* British television drama series &quot;The Coroner&quot; has as its main character a coroner based in a fictional Devon town.
* &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; features Jill Hennessy as Jordan Cavanaugh, M.D., a crime-solving forensic pathologist employed in the Massachusetts Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.
* The coroners are significant characters and main cast members on &quot;&quot; and its spin-offs &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.
* The television series &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot; has a coroner as its title character.
* The American police procedural drama series &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; features a coroner named Dr. Max Bergman, played by Japanese-American actor Masi Oka.
* Kujo Kiriya from the 2016 Japanese TV series &quot;Kamen Rider Ex-Aid&quot; is a coroner.
* Kurt Fuller plays Woody, a coroner on the American detective comedy-drama &quot;Psych&quot;.
* The television series &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; has the title character (a medical examiner) under the authority of the county coroner.
* The television series &quot;Wojeck&quot; (the Canadian ancestor of &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;) has a coroner as its title character, inspired by the coroner Morton Shulman.
* In &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, the detectives are regularly assisted by coroner Melinda Warner.
