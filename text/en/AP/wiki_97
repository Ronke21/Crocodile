<text>Willow is a census-designated place (CDP) in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. Located 26 miles northwest from Wasilla along the George Parks Highway, it is part of the Anchorage, Alaska Metropolitan Statistical Area. At the 2020 census the population was 2,196, up from 2,102 in 2010.

==History==
The community got its start in 1897 when miners discovered gold on Willow Creek. Ships and boats brought supplies and equipment up Cook Inlet, landing at Knik or Tyonek. From Knik, a 26-mile summer trail went northwesterly. The trail along Willow Creek heading east became Hatcher Pass Road, currently an adventurous scenic road used during the summer tour season.

In 1920, the Alaska Railroad built its Willow station house at mile 185.7 along the tracks leading from Seward to Fairbanks.

During World War II, a radar warning station and airfield were built near the railroad tracks; a post office was established in 1948.
By 1954, Willow Creek was Alaska&#x27;s largest gold mining district, with a total production approaching 18 million dollars.
Around 1970, before construction of the Parks Highway, Willow had a population of 78 until land disposals, homestead subdivisions, and completion of the George Parks Highway in 1972 fueled growth in the area.
In 1976, Alaskans elected to move the state capital from Juneau to Willow in an effort to improve access for Alaskans while keeping the capital out of Anchorage, the largest city. Landscape architect M. Paul Friedberg created a master plan for the city as part of one such proposal. This fueled interest and land speculation in the area. However, funding to enable the capital move was defeated in the November 1982 election. As a result, Juneau remains the state capital.
More than half of the 1,500 cabins around Willow are for seasonal use. Nearly all of the occupied homes in Willow are fully plumbed, using individual on-site water wells, septic tanks and drain fields.

Willow is now the official host of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race restart.

In June 2015, a large wildfire burned thousands of acres of wilderness, numerous structures and forced the closure of the George Parks Highway, severing the road link between Anchorage and Fairbanks.

In the city, the age distribution of the population shows 45.3% under the age of 18, 12.3% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 10.1% from 45 to 64, and 3.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 20 years. For every 100 females, there were 101.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 118.8 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $21,875, and the median income for a family was $16,786. Males had a median income of $11,250 versus $25,000 for females. The per capita income for the city was $7,278. About 43.3% of families and 48.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 50.8% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

==Education==

Brevig Mission is served by the Bering Strait School District. Brevig Mission School serves grades Pre-K through 12.

==1918 Spanish Flu==
The pandemic caused by the 1918 influenza outbreak was by far the most devastating single disease outbreak in modern history, killing at least 50 million people during an 18-month period. In Brevig Mission alone, it killed 72 out of 80 residents in a 5-day period. The 72 victims were buried in the frozen ground in a mass grave dug for them by gold miners and marked by white crosses. As happened elsewhere in the Americas after the arrival of Columbus, Indigenous Alaska Natives had no genetic resistance to any flu, so it decimated many villages.

In 1997, a team of scientists led by Johan Hultin exhumed the frozen remains of an Iñupiat woman who had been buried in the permafrost in a gravesite near Brevig Mission in a successful attempt to recover RNA from her lung tissue. It enabled them to analyze the structure of the 1918 influenza virus (Spanish flu), which may have originated in Fort Riley, Kansas, that killed her.

==Health==
Sale, importation and possession of alcohol are banned in the village.

<text>Diomede (, ) is an incorporated town and is the only habitable area on Little Diomede Island. The island is located in the Nome Census Area of the Unorganized Borough of the U.S. state of Alaska. All the buildings are on the west coast of Little Diomede, which is the smaller of the two Diomede Islands located in the middle of the Bering Strait between the United States and the Russian Far East. Diomede is the only settlement on Little Diomede Island. The population is 82 people, down from 115 at the 2010 census and 146 in 2000.

Its native name means &quot;the other one&quot; or &quot;the one over there&quot;. It is also imprecisely spelled &quot;Inalik&quot;.

== History ==
The current location of the city is believed by some archaeologists to have been inhabited for at least 3,000 years. It was originally a spring hunting campsite and the early explorers from the west found the Iñupiat (Inuit) at Diomede had an advanced culture, including elaborate whale hunting ceremonies. Trade occurred with both continents.

=== 1648–1867 ===
The first European to reach the Diomede Islands was Russian explorer Semyon Dezhnev, in 1648; the next was Danish-born Russian navigator and explorer Vitus Bering, who re-discovered the islands on August 16, 1728, and named the islands after martyr St. Diomede, who was celebrated in the Russian Orthodox Church on that date.

The United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, including Little Diomede. A new boundary was drawn between the two Diomede Islands, and the Big Diomede was left to Russia.

=== 1880s–1920s ===
In the town&#x27;s census of 1880, 40 residents of the island were recorded. According to naturalist John Muir, who visited the Diomede Islands in the 1880s, natives were eager to trade away everything they had. The village was perched on the steep rocky slope of the mountain, which has sheer drops into deep water. Huts were mostly built of stone with skin roofs.

During the Nome gold rush at the turn of the 20th century, Diomede villagers traveled to Nome along with the gold seekers, even though Nome was not a native village. People from Diomede arrived in umiaks and stayed in Nome for the summer, trading and gathering items before they returned to their isolated village.

=== 1940s ===
According to Arthur Ahkinga, who lived on Little Diomede island at the turn of the 1940s, the Iñupiat on the island made their living by hunting and carving ivory that they traded or sold. They caught fish such as bullheads, tomcods and blue cods. Whaling was still a major practice. During the winter, they used fur parkas and skin mukluks made out of hunted animals to protect themselves from the cold and wind. Recreational activities included skating, snowshoeing, handball, soccer and Inuit dancing. After dark, people spent the rest of the evening telling jokes and stories. In summer time, they traveled with skin boats equipped with outboard motors to Siberia or Wales, Alaska. Winter travel was limited to neighboring Big Diomede due to weather conditions. Between July and October, half of the population went to Nome to sell their carvings and skins and trade for supplies.

Despite being separated by the new border after the Alaska purchase in 1867, Big Diomede had been home to families now living on Little Diomede, and the people living on the American side of the border were close relatives to those living on the Russian side. The communities on both islands were separated by politics but connected by family kinships. Despite being officially forbidden, the Inuit from both islands occasionally visited their neighbors, sometimes under the cover of fog, to meet their relatives and exchange small gifts. The local schoolteachers on Little Diomede counted 178 people from Big Diomede and the Siberian mainland who visited the island within six months, between January and July in 1944.

At the beginning of the Cold War in the late 1940s, Big Diomede became a USSR (Soviet Union) military base, and all its native residents were removed to mainland Russia. When people from Little Diomede went too close to the Russian side or tried to visit their relatives on the neighboring island during World War II, they were arrested. According to one of the survivors, Oscar Ahkinga, after 52 days of internment and interrogation, the Iñupiat were banished and told not to come back.

=== 1950s ===
The school year 1953–1954 on Little Diomede Island was adapted to better serve the local needs. Teaching took place throughout the holidays and also on some weekends in order to complete the 180 days of schooling before the walrus migration started in Spring. The annual walrus hunt was a major source of supplies and income and required the help of all inhabitants. The primary language at the time was Inupiat, and students were also taught English. The only means of communicating with the outside world was by so-called &quot;Bush Phone,&quot; provided through the Alaska Communication System station in Nome. Previously non-existent health care was improved with basic medication knowledge provided by seasonal teachers.

=== 1970s ===
During the seventies, the village on Little Diomede was gradually inhabited as a permanent settlement and the entire island was incorporated into the city of Diomede in 1970.

=== 1980s ===
On August 7, 1987 the American swimmer Lynne Cox swam between American Little Diomede Island and then Soviet Big Diomede Island. Cox performed the swim as a peace gesture, hoping to help improve American-Soviet relations during the final years of the Cold War. Later that year the Soviet Secretary General Gorbachev travelled to Washington to sign a nuclear weapons treaty with American President Reagan. After the signing ceremony Gorbachev raised his glass and proposed a toast to Lynne Cox, the swimmer. He said, &quot;She proved by her courage how close to each other our peoples live.&quot;

=== 1990s ===
Little Diomede, though a whaling community prior to this, was not included in the formation of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission and its needs were not taken into account in determining the bowhead quota for Inupiat and Yupik because of its remote location. In 1992, Little Diomede was formally recognized as a whaling community, per the AEWC.

After the Cold War ended in December 1991, interest in reuniting with families across the Bering Strait grew. In 1994, the people of Little Diomede island collected cash and groceries while local dancers practiced almost every night as the islanders prepared for a visit of more than one hundred friends and relatives from Siberia for which they wanted to be hospitable and generous hosts.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

Little Diomede Island is located about west from the mainland, in the middle of the Bering Strait. It is only from the International Date Line and about from the Russian island of Big Diomede.

=== Geology ===

The Little Diomede island is composed of Cretaceous age granite or quartz monzonite. The city is located in the only area that does not have near-vertical cliffs to the water. Behind the city and around the entire island, rocky slopes rise at about 40° up to the relatively flattened top at . The island has scant vegetation.

=== Climate ===
Diomede, although slightly south of the Arctic Circle, has a dry-summer polar climate (Köppen &quot;ETs&quot;), because the driest high-sun month (April) has less than one-third as much precipitation as the wettest high-sun month (October). The winters are icy and cold – colder than those of Nome despite the island location due to greater proximity to extremely cold Siberian air masses. The extreme moderating effect of the thawed Bering Sea produces very cool summers, with the result that most plants are unable to grow. The hottest summer ever experienced temperatures up to only .
==Demographics==

Diomede first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as the unincorporated Inuit village of Inalit. It returned as &quot;Ignaluk&quot; on the 1890 census. It next appeared on the 1910-40 censuses as &quot;Little Diomede Island.&quot; In 1950, it returned as Diomede. It was incorporated as a city in 1970. Diomede also appears on the census as Inalik, designated as an Alaska Native Village Statistical Area (ANVSA).

===2020 census===
===2000 census===
As of the census of 2000, there were 146 people, 43 households, and 31 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 47 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 92.47% Native American, 6.16% White and 1.37% from two or more races.

There were 43 households, out of which 37.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 20.9% were married couples living together, 32.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.9% were non-families. 18.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.40 and the average family size was 4.00.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 43.8% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 25.3% from 25 to 44, 17.1% from 45 to 64, and 6.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females, there were 114.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 121.6 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $23,750, and the median income for a family was $24,583. Males had a median income of $41,250 versus $26,875 for females. The per capita income for the city was $29,944. 41.4% of families and 35.4% of the population were living below the poverty line, including 33.8% of under eighteens and 44.4% of those over 64.

== Community ==

The location of the city is believed to have been used for at least 3,000 years as a hunting campsite. In the late 19th century, travelers reported people living in huts made out of rocks and with skin roofs. (see History).

The first square building on the island was a small Catholic church, which was planned by Father Bellarmine Lafortune in 1935 and built by Father Thomas Cunningham during his residency on the island between 1936 and 1947. It was built from donated lumber from Nome. The next square building in the island was a one-room schoolhouse, which also served as a home for the teacher&#x27;s family. A new, larger church building built by Father Thomas Carlin and Brother Ignatius Jakes was completed on March 3, 1979.

Today there are about 30 buildings on the island, including the residential housing that was mainly built in the 1970s and 1980s. A laundromat (washeteria) has been built to serve the community with washers, dryers, and showers. A clinic for basic health care is located on the upper floor of the same building. The island also has a school, library, heliport and a satellite dish for television, telephone, fax, and internet service. There is no bank or restaurant, and the supplies of the main store on the island are limited to food, beverage, clothing, firearms, ammunition, and fuel. Snacks, clothing, diapers, and other items are often ordered from Anchorage Walmart and Fred Meyer stores by mail or parcel. As in many other Alaska Native villages, the import and sale of alcohol is prohibited.

=== Electricity ===
An electric system was built on the island in the 1970s, and electricity is provided by city-operated Diomede Joint Utilities. They provide houses and other facilities with electricity produced by diesel generators. Diesel fuel is stored in large tanks, which are placed at the furthest possible location from the housing. While the electric facility owns the largest fuel tank, measuring , the school and the village council store both own tanks measuring about each. (Some sources suggest the school has upgraded its fuel storage to two tanks). Gasoline and propane are also used for fuel.

=== Water and disposal ===
Water for winter use is drawn from a mountain spring, then treated and stored in storage tanks. Because the permafrost prevents pipelines from being installed underground, residents must manually carry water from the tank. Even with a tank this size, the water supply usually runs out by March, the laundromat is closed and residents must melt their drinking water from snow and ice.

Funds for improving the water system have been requested both by the city and the school. Having a separate tank for the school would decrease the usage of city water and would also serve as a backup water supply for the whole city. Funds have also been requested for improvements to refuse collection and for an incinerator, because the ground conditions on the island limits waste disposal to burning combustibles and disposing of everything else on the ice. Honeybuckets and privies are used, except in the laundromat, clinic, and school, which are served by a septic system.

=== Education ===
The island&#x27;s only school is likely the most isolated school in the United States. The Diomede School has approximately 20 students from grades pre-K through 12 and three teachers. It is part of the Bering Strait School District. The number of teachers fluctuates based on the student population.

=== Health care and emergency services ===
There is no hospital located on the island, and emergency services are limited due to the remoteness of the island. A city council-owned clinic operates in the laundromat building, providing basic health care.

While other emergency services are provided by volunteers and a health aide, the fire and rescue service is provided by Diomede Volunteer Fire Department and First Responders. In case of a major health emergency, patients are airlifted to the mainland hospital in Nome, weather permitting. The closest law enforcement are dispatched from the Alaska State Troopers barracks on the mainland in Nome.

Frozen ground and lack of soil on the rocky island prevents digging graves, so rocks are piled on top of the burial sites instead.

On November 7, 2009, it was announced that one inhabitant was infected with H1N1 swine flu.

== Economy ==
=== Employment ===
Employment on the island is mostly limited to the city, post office, and school. There have been a few seasonal jobs, such as mining and construction, but recently these have been in decline. The Diomede people are excellent ivory carvers and the city serves as a wholesale agent for the ivory. Ivory works are mainly sold in mainland Alaska in Fairbanks and Anchorage, but can occasionally be purchased online. The inhabitants also hunt whales during spring from openings in the sea ice. Whaling largely ceased from the middle to late 20th century, before resuming again in 1999.

===Taxes===
The city levies a 3% sales tax, but there are no property taxes on the island.

== Transportation ==
=== Historical transportation ===
When Alaska was still connected to Siberia over 10,000 years ago by the Bering Land Bridge, the Little Diomede was not an island but was a part of Beringia and accessible by foot. However, it is unknown whether humans visited the grounds of the Little Diomede at that time. Most likely, the first visitors came when it had become an island, simply by foot on top of the sea ice. Later, Umiaks were used to visit the neighboring Big Diomede island for whale hunting and fishing, and later, to access mainland Alaska and Siberia. Boats made out of driftwood and whale skin are still used today.

In the early 1940s, one of the Little Diomede residents wrote &quot;No airplane comes to Diomede except for some very special reason, during the winter. The MS &quot;North Star&quot; brings groceries for the people on the island from Nome. At the same time she unloads freight for the school teachers. The Coast Guard cutter Northland comes in twice during the summer to look after the natives&quot;.

=== Internal transport ===
There are no roads, highways, railroads, or internal waterways on the island. There are ancient but faint rocky trails heading north and south from the City of Diomede. There are also trails between the buildings. In the fall of 2008, many of the footpaths within the city were replaced by a system of boardwalks and stairs. On the small island with total land area of only , the only ways to get from place to place are by foot, ski, or snowmobile. Because only the city is inhabited, no internal transport systems have been constructed.

=== External transport ===
Due to the remoteness and severe weather, Little Diomede Island is very difficult and risky to access from the outside world. An average of 12–15 knot (6–8 m/s; ) winds with gusts up to 48–68 knots (25–35 m/s), a prevalent fog and cloudy sky limit transportation to a minimum. Even medical evacuation from such a location has its own difficulties.

Mail has been delivered to the island by helicopter since 1982 and is currently delivered weekly (up until 2013, mail was delivered by plane more frequently in winter months when the ice runway allowed for more deliveries). The postal contract is one of the oldest in the nation, the only one that uses helicopters for delivering mail, and with a cost of over $300,000 annually, is the most expensive in Alaska.

An annual delivery of goods and supplies is made by barge during the summer, which usually is the only cargo delivered during the year. When the supplies come, all the men rush down and pull them off and carry them up. Other visitors to the island include the occasional visits by research teams, rare extreme tourists and other Alaska Natives visiting from the mainland Alaska.

Due to its location and weather conditions, transportation to the island is very expensive. Having very few economic development opportunities and a tight budget, the city charges non-business visitors arriving by plane or boat a $50.00 fee.

When U.S. Senator Ted Stevens arrived to the island on October 29, 2002, for an overnight visit, he commented &quot;I did not realize you were this remote&quot;. He arrived by a National Guard Blackhawk helicopter, and it was the first time the island was visited by a statewide elected official.

==== Helicopter ====
The main access to the island is by helicopter. Until the late 1990s, the bow of a shipwrecked old barge served as a temporary landing platform. Today, the village has the Diomede Heliport constructed by the U.S. Marine Corps in 2000 and owned by the Alaska Department of Transportation. The concrete-surfaced heliport measures 64 feet x 64 feet (20 m x 20 m). It is open to the public, has no control tower and is only about from the International Date Line and less than from Big Diomede. It is the closest United States heliport to Russia.

Since 2012, the United States Department of Transportation has subsidized scheduled weekly passenger service via helicopter between Diomede Heliport and Nome Airport.

==== Airplane ====
Currently there are no airports on Little Diomede Island because of the island&#x27;s rocky, steep slopes. Most winters a temporary runway is cleared on top of the sea ice just off of the coast of the village, but in some years (e.g. winter 2009) ice conditions have prevented construction. Some bush pilots have occasionally landed on the top of the tuya which is rocky, but has a somewhat flat surface during the snowy winter. The only way to land with an airplane during the few summer months is on water with a float plane. Any type of airplane landing on the island is very rare due to the high risk and severe weather. There have been studies on the construction of a permanent runway.

==== Boat ====
There is no port in Little Diomede Island, and surrounding thick Arctic sea ice limits boat access to the island to only a few summer months. High waves and huge blocks of ice in the area make navigation very risky and difficult. Landing by boat is also difficult and dangerous because of the rocky shoreline of Little Diomede Island. The barge delivering supplies once a year and occasional other watercraft usually stay offshore due to conditions of the shoreline.

=== Transportation improvements ===
There have been studies of improving the transportation system within and out of the island. Proposals and studies vary between a port, a runway, and the Intercontinental Tunnel or Bridge. According to the National Association for State Community Services Programs (NASCSP), the difficult and limited access to the island has put economic pressure on the community, and the tribal council has already voted to begin planning for relocation of the community to the mainland if access and housing conditions are not improved. No plan for constructing a port, airport, runway, tunnel, or bridge has been put into action. According to 2006 United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documentation, however, better access to the island will raise issues with its dedicated nature, environment, and local cultural traditions.

==== Air and water ====
There have been multiple studies of navigation improvements, a feasibility study of constructing an airport or runway on the island, and studies of any multi-use potential of the port and airport projects as a storm damage prevention.

==== Bridge or tunnel ====
There have been proposals to construct an intercontinental bridge or tunnel between the Alaskan mainland and mainland Siberia, which in some proposals is tied to the possibility of closing the gap in railroad between Alaska and British Columbia. Service access to one or both Diomede Islands from such bridge or tunnel would dramatically improve transportation to the Little Diomede and also make access safer. Though these proposals date back as far as the early 20th century, most of them have been just visions of individuals or groups or media, and have not resulted in governmental study by either the USA or Russia.

==Boulder Creek uranium mine controversy==
In 2005, mining company Full Metal Minerals announced a partnership with Triex Minerals Corporation to develop a uranium deposit north of Elim. Development of the site began with survey and exploration work in Sept 2005. Initial drilling exploration was completed in July 2006, confirming deposits of &quot;sandstone-hosted uranium&quot; at the Boulder Creek site in Death Valley, north of Elim.

The Boulder Creek mine site is located on part of the Tubutulik River. Serious water and air pollution risks, including radioactive byproducts, have been identified with &quot;in-situ leeching&quot;, the type of uranium mining proposed for the site. Villagers have raised concerns that radioactive by-products of uranium mining would adversely affect the plants, fish, and wildlife on which they rely. In September 2007, Irene Murray of Aniguiin High School in Elim wrote an open letter to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, drawing attention to projected impacts on the local environment and human health. Protests led by Elim Students Against Uranium (ESAU) have included demonstrations in 2008 and 2009 at the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race ceremonial start, and on the Iditarod trail in Elim.

The village has raised legal concerns over the project that include an alleged failure by the federal Bureau of Land Management to provide adequate public notice and public comment periods regarding the Boulder Creek mine project. Portions of the regulatory process are under the purview of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

<text>Gambell () is a city in the Nome Census Area of the U.S. state of Alaska. Located on St. Lawrence Island, it had a population of 681 at the 2010 census, up from 649 in 2000.

== History ==
&quot;Sivuqaq&quot; is the Yupik language name for St. Lawrence Island and for Gambell. It has also been called &quot;Chibuchack&quot; and &quot;Sevuokok&quot;.

St. Lawrence Island has been inhabited sporadically for the past 2,000 years by both Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik and Siberian Yupik people. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the island had a population of about 4,000.

Between 1878 and 1880 a famine decimated the island&#x27;s population. Many who did not starve left. The remaining population of St. Lawrence Island was nearly all Siberian Yupik.

In 1887, the Reformed Episcopal Church of America opened a mission on St. Lawrence Island. That year, a carpenter, lumber and tools were left at Sivuqaq by a ship. The carpenter worked with local Yupik to build a wood building, the first they had ever seen. When the building was finished, the carpenter left the keys to the door with a local chief and departed. Since the carpenter had not spoken Siberian Yupik, the residents did not know the purpose of the building.

The Reformed Episcopal Church had not been able to find missionaries willing to live on St. Lawrence Island, so the building built for the mission was left unoccupied. In 1890, the building was acquired by Sheldon Jackson. He spoke to the Reverend Vene and Nellie Gambell, of Wapello, Iowa, about moving to St. Lawrence Island. Gambell was hired as a schoolteacher and the Gambells came to the island in 1894. They had a daughter in 1897. Nellie Gambell became ill and the Gambells spent the winter of 1897–1898 in the United States, where Nellie was hospitalized. In the spring of 1898, on the return journey to St. Lawrence Island, their ship sank in a storm and 37 people on it drowned, including the Gambells and their daughter. After their death, Sivuqaq was renamed in the Gambells&#x27; honor.

On June 22, 1955, during the Cold War, a US Navy P2V Neptune with a crew of 11 was attacked by two Soviet fighters in international waters over the Bering Straits between Siberia and Alaska, and crashed near Gambell. Locals from Gambell rescued the crew, 3 of whom were wounded by Soviet fire, and 4 of whom were injured in the crash. The Soviet government, in response to a US diplomatic protest, was unusually conciliatory, stating:
The Soviet military was under strict orders to &quot;avoid any action beyond the limits of the Soviet state frontiers.&quot;

The Soviet government &quot;expressed regret in regard to the incident&quot;, adding that &quot;taking into account... conditions which do not exclude the possibility of a mistake from one side or the other,&quot; it was willing to compensate the US for 50% of damages sustained—the first such offer ever made by the Soviets for any Cold War shootdown incident. The US government said it was satisfied with the Soviet expression of regret and the offer of partial compensation, although it said that the Soviet statement fell short of what the available information indicated.

Gambell and Savoonga received joint title to most of St. Lawrence Island under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.

The Gambell incident occurred on February 27, 1974, when a Soviet Antonov An-24LR &quot;Toros&quot; (CCCP-47195) ice reconnaissance aircraft landed at Gambell.

On August 30, 1975, Wien Air Alaska Flight 99 crashed when trying to land in Gambell. 10 of the 32 passengers and crew on board were killed.

In October 2022, two Russian citizens arrived in Gambell by small boat and sought political asylum, saying they wanted to avoid compulsory military service during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It was an unusual and dangerous trip; Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy said he did not expect a continual stream of other arrivals. US Senator for Alaska Lisa Murkowski later revealed that the two refugees were members of a group indigenous to Siberia.

==Geography==
Gambell is on the northwest cape of St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea, southwest of Nome. It is from the Chukchi Peninsula in the Russian Far East.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and (64.10%) is water.

The town is served by Gambell Airport.

===Climate===
Owing to the influence of the cold Bering Sea, Gambell has a polar climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;). Its hottest month averages cooler than . The climate features long, frigid and snowy winters alongside short cool summers. The cold sea creates pronounced seasonal lag, sufficient that April averages colder than December and May colder than October.

Compared to most northern hemisphere polar climates, Gambell is relatively moderate, featuring only discontinuous permafrost and despite the freezing of the Bering Sea less frigid winters than typical for Asia and North America at similar latitudes. As an example, Iqaluit on the other side of North America averages colder over the year at a similar latitude, and Arviat on northern Hudson Bay colder despite being two degrees farther south.

==Demographics==

Gambell first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It was formally incorporated in 1963.

=== 2020 census ===

<text>Golovin (formerly Chinik, from or ; ) is a city in Nome Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 156, up from 144 in 2000.

==Geography==
Golovin is located at (64.544612, -163.027459).

Golovin is on a point of land between Golovnin Bay and Golovnin Lagoon on the Seward Peninsula in western Alaska. It is about east of Nome. The area receives its name from Russian Vice-Admiral Vasily Mikhailovich Golovnin, (1776–1831). The town name is misspelled while the bay and lagoon retain the correct spelling.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

==Demographics==

The present city of Golovin appeared on the 1890 U.S. Census as the native village of Ikaleaveagmiut. In 1900, it would report as Cheennik Village (or Dexter), then an unincorporated village. It would not report again until 1930 when the name was officially reported as Golovin. It would formally incorporate as a city in 1971.

There also were reported the settlements of Golofnin Bay (population 25) and Golofnin City (village) (population 185) on the 1890 and 1900 censuses, but these may have been separate areas outside of the present day Golovin, with the former described as consisting of four small Inuit settlements (Siningmon, Netsekawik, Ukodlint &amp; Chillimiut) on an unspecified location in the bay area. The 1900 census considered Golofnin City a successor to Golofnin Bay, though it appeared that this community was located at the site of the Golovin (or Golofnin) Mission, a Swedish Evangelical Union mission and reindeer station, which was along the east side of the Golovnin Bay (now since abandoned). To compound the confusion, a post office (called Golovin) was established at the mission in 1899, but closed in 1906. It was then relocated to the present Golovin in 1908 and kept the same name.

As of the census of 2000, there were 144 people, 45 households, and 30 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 54 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 7.64% White, 84.03% Native American, and 8.33% from two or more races. 2.78% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Of the 45 households, 44.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.0% were married couples living together, 20.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.3% were non-families. 31.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.20 and the average family size was 4.17.

In the city, the age distribution of the population shows 42.4% under the age of 18, 6.3% from 18 to 24, 28.5% from 25 to 44, 16.7% from 45 to 64, and 6.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 26 years. For every 100 females, there were 118.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 118.4 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $31,875, and the median income for a family was $41,250. Males had a median income of $25,625 versus $31,250 for females. The per capita income for the city was $13,281. There were none of the families and 4.3% of the population living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.

==History==
Golovin was originally an Inupiat village called &quot;Chiŋik&quot;.

Golovin was named for Captain Vasily Golovnin of the Russian Navy, who visited Alaska to inspect the workings of the Russian-American Company in 1807–1809, in the &quot;Diana&quot;, and in 1817–1819, in the &quot;Kamchatka&quot;, while circumnavigating the world. Lt. Lavrenty Zagoskin, from the Imperial Russian Navy sent to Alaska to scout locations for trading posts, reported the village as &quot;Ikalikguigmyut&quot; in 1842. In 1867, the Mission Covenant of Sweden established a church and school south of the current site of Golovin. Around 1890, John Dexter established a trading post that became the center for swapping prospecting information for the entire Seward Peninsula. Gold was discovered in 1898 at Council and Golovin became a supply point for the gold fields. Supplies were unloaded from ships at Golovin and shipped across Golovnin Lagoon and up the Fish and Niukluk Rivers to Council.

When gold was discovered in what is now Nome, much of the mining and shipping activity moved there and Golovin declined in population.

Reindeer herding was introduced in the area about 1900.

Golovin is used as a checkpoint on the Iditarod in Nome, Alaska.

<text>Nome (; (, , also &quot;Sitŋazuaq&quot;, &quot;Siqnazuaq&quot;)) is a city in the Nome Census Area in the Unorganized Borough of the US state of Alaska. The city is located on the southern Seward Peninsula coast on Norton Sound of the Bering Sea. It had a population of 3,699 recorded in the 2020 census, up from 3,598 in 2010. Nome was incorporated on April 9, 1901. It was once the most-populous city in Alaska. Nome lies within the region of the Bering Straits Native Corporation, which is headquartered in Nome.

Prior to being settled by non indigenous people, Nome was home to Iñupiat natives. The area came to Western attention in 1898, when three Nordic-Americans discovered gold on the ocean shores of Nome, prompting the Nome Gold Rush. Within a year, the area became popular among miners of European descent, who incorporated the city; sending the population to some 10,000. Gold mining supported this population into the early 1900s, but the city&#x27;s numbers had fallen considerably by 1910. A series of fires and violent storms destroyed most of Nome&#x27;s Gold Rush era buildings between 1905 and 1974. In the winter of 1925, a diphtheria epidemic raged among Alaska Natives in the Nome area. Fierce territory-wide blizzard conditions prevented the delivery of a life-saving diphtheria antitoxin serum by airplane from Anchorage. A relay of dog sled teams was organized to deliver the serum, which was successfully led by Balto and Togo. Today, the Iditarod Dog Sled Race follows the same route they took and ends in Nome.

In the 21st century, Nome&#x27;s economy remains based around gold mining, which is now mostly carried out offshore. The city of Nome also claims to be home to the world&#x27;s largest gold pan, although this claim has been disputed by the Canadian city of Quesnel, British Columbia.

==Etymology==

The origin of the city&#x27;s name &quot;Nome&quot; is debated; there are three theories. The first is that the name was given by Nome&#x27;s founder, Jafet Lindeberg, an immigrant from Norway. Nome appears as a toponym in several places in Norway.

A second theory is that Nome received its name through an error: allegedly when a British cartographer copied an ambiguous annotation made by a British officer on a nautical chart, while on a voyage up the Bering Strait. The officer had written &quot;? Name&quot; next to the unnamed cape. The mapmaker misread the annotation as &quot;C. Nome&quot;, or Cape Nome, and used that name on his own chart; the city in turn took its name from the cape. Noted toponymist and historian George R. Stewart favored this explanation, citing a letter from the British Admiralty which allegedly confirmed the story from historical records.

The third proposed origin of the name is from a misunderstanding of the local Inupiaq word for &quot;Where at?&quot;, &quot;Naami&quot;.

In February 1899, some local miners and merchants voted to change the name from Nome to Anvil City, because of the confusion with Cape Nome, east, and the Nome River, the mouth of which is east of Nome. The United States Post Office in Nome refused to accept the change. Fearing a move of the post office to Nome City, a mining camp on the Nome River, the merchants unhappily agreed to change the name of Anvil City back to Nome.

==Geography and climate==

Nome is located at (64.503889, −165.399444).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (41.99%) is water.

Nome has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;), closely bordering on a tundra, with long, very cold winters, and short, cool summers. However, conditions in both winter and summer are moderated by the city&#x27;s coastal location; winters are less severe than in the Interior, and conversely, summers are lukewarm. For example, Fairbanks at a similar parallel quite far inland has much greater temperature swings with both very warm and cold temperatures throughout the year. Even so, Nome is influenced by Far East Russia&#x27;s cold landmass and as a result the climate is much colder than in coastal Scandinavia at similar latitudes.
The coldest month is January, averaging , although highs on average breach the freezing point on 3–5 days per month from December to March and there are 72 days annually of or lower temperatures, which have been recorded as early as October 12 in 1996 and as late as May 5 in 1984. Average highs stay below freezing from late October until late April, and the average first and last dates of freezing lows are September 2 and June 9, respectively, a freeze-free period of 78 days. The warmest month is July, with an average of ; temperatures rarely reach or remain above the whole night.

==Demographics==
Nome first appeared on the 1900 US Census as an unincorporated village of 12,488 residents. At the time, it was the largest community in Alaska, ahead of Skagway and Juneau, the 2nd and 3rd largest places. The demographics for 1900 included 12,395 Whites, 42 Natives, 41 Asians and 10 Blacks. It was incorporated as a city in 1901. By 1910, it had fallen to 2,600 residents. Of those, 2,311 were White, 235 were Natives and 54 for all other races. It dropped to the 2nd largest city in Alaska behind Fairbanks. By 1920, it dropped to 9th place, with just 852 residents.

In 1930, it rose to 6th largest with 1,213 residents (882 Whites, 326 Natives, 5 others). In 1940, it remained in 6th place with 1,559 residents. It dropped to 10th place in 1950 with 1,876 residents. In 1960, it rose to 8th place with 2,316 residents (with 1,608 &quot;other&quot;, which was mostly Native; 705 Whites and 3 Blacks). By 1970, Nome had fallen out of the top 10 places to 18th largest community (although 9th largest incorporated city). In 1980, it was 15th largest (12th largest incorporated city). In 1990, it was 16th largest (12th largest incorporated city). In 2000, it was 25th largest (16th largest incorporated city). In 2010, it was now the 30th largest (16th largest incorporated city).

The population of Nome is a mixture of Inupiat Eskimos and non-Natives. Although some employment opportunities are available, subsistence activities are prevalent in the community. A federally recognized tribe is located in the community, the Nome Eskimo Community. Former villagers from King Island also live in Nome. The ANCSA village corporation in Nome is Sitnasuak Native Corporation.

==History==

===Pre-European colonization===
Inupiat hunted for game on the west coast of Alaska from prehistoric times and there is recent archeological evidence to suggest that there was an Inupiat settlement at Nome, known in Inupiat as Sitnasuak, before the discovery of gold.

===Gold rush===

In the summer of 1898, the &quot;Three Lucky Swedes&quot;: Norwegian-American Jafet Lindeberg, and two naturalized American citizens of Swedish birth, Erik Lindblom and John Brynteson, discovered gold on Anvil Creek. News of the discovery reached the outside world that winter. By 1899, Nome had a population of 10,000 and the area was organized as the Nome mining district. In that year, gold was found in the beach sands for dozens of miles along the coast at Nome, which spurred the stampede to new heights. Thousands more people poured into Nome during the spring of 1900 aboard steamships from the ports of Seattle and San Francisco. By 1900, a tent city on the beaches and on the treeless coast reached , from Cape Rodney to Cape Nome. In June of that year, Nome averaged 1000 newcomers a day.

In 1899, Charles D. Lane founded Wild Goose Mining &amp; Trading Co. His company constructed the Wild Goose Railroad from Nome to Dexter Discovery; it was extended (1906-1908) to the village of Shelton, also known as Lanes Landing.

Many late-comers tried to &quot;jump&quot; the original claims by filing mining claims covering the same ground. The federal judge for the area ruled the original claims valid, but some of the claim jumpers agreed to share their invalid claims with influential Washington politicians. Alexander McKenzie took an interest in the gold rush and secured the appointment of Arthur Noyes as the federal district judge for the Nome region for the purpose of taking control of gold placer mines in Nome. McKenzie seized mining claims with an unlawfully procured receivership granted by Judge Noyes. McKenzie&#x27;s claim-jumping scheme was eventually stopped by the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the episode provided the plot for Rex Beach&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;The Spoilers&quot; (1906), which was made into a stage play, then five times into movies, including one starring John Wayne: &quot;The Spoilers&quot; (co-starring Marlene Dietrich). The similarly-themed Wayne film &quot;North to Alaska&quot; also takes place in the environs and mentions the town in its theme song. Wyatt Earp, of Tombstone, Arizona, fame, lived in Nome during gold-rush days - in September 1899, Earp and partner Charles E. Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon, the city&#x27;s first two-story wooden building and its largest and most luxurious saloon out of more than 60 saloons.
During the period from 1900 to 1909, estimates of Nome&#x27;s population reached as high as 20,000. The highest recorded population of Nome, in the 1900 United States Census, was 12,488. At this time, Nome was the largest city in the Alaska Territory. Early in this period, the U.S. Army policed the area, and expelled any inhabitant each autumn who did not have shelter (or the resources to pay for shelter) for the harsh winter.

By 1910 Nome&#x27;s population had fallen to 2,600, and by 1934, to less than 1,500.

In May 1910, the &quot;Industrial Worker&quot;, the newspaper of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), published a notice from the Nome Miners&#x27; Union and Local 240 of the Western Federation of Miners for all unemployed workers to stay away, saying that &quot;All the rich mines are practically worked out.&quot;

Fires in 1905 and 1934, as well as violent storms in 1900, 1913, 1945 and 1974, destroyed much of Nome&#x27;s gold rush-era architecture. The pre-fire &quot;Discovery Saloon&quot; is now a private residence and is being slowly restored as a landmark.

The Black Wolf Squadron, under the command of Capt. St. Clair Streett, landed here on August 23, 1920, after the culmination of a 4527-mile flight from Mitchel Field. Noel Wien and Gene Miller based their air services from Nome in June 1927.

===Serum run===

In 1925, Nome was the destination of the famous Great Race of Mercy, in which dog sleds played a large part in transporting diphtheria antitoxin serum through harsh conditions. In 1973, Nome became the ending point of the 1,049+ mi (1,600+ km) Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. The latter part of its route was used in the serum run.

The sled driver of the final leg of the relay was the Norwegian-born Gunnar Kaasen; his lead sled dog was Balto. A statue of Balto by F.G. Roth stands near the Central Park Zoo in Central Park, New York City. Leonhard Seppala ran the penultimate, and longest, leg of the 1925 serum run to Nome. One of his dogs, Togo, is considered the forgotten hero of the Great Race of Mercy; another of his dogs, Fritz, is preserved and on display at the Carrie M. McLain Memorial Museum in Nome.

===World War II and later===
During World War II, Nome was the last stop on the ferry system for planes flying from the United States to the Soviet Union for the Lend-lease program. The airstrip currently in use was built and troops were stationed there. One &quot;Birchwood&quot; hangar remains and has been transferred to a local group with hopes to restore it. It is not located on the former Marks Air Force Base (now the primary Nome Airport); rather it is a remnant of an auxiliary landing field a mile or so away: &quot;Satellite Field&quot;. In the hills north of the city, there were auxiliary facilities associated with the Distant Early Warning system that are visible from the city but are no longer in use.

Total gold production for the Nome district has been at least .

Nome&#x27;s population decline continued after 1910 although at a fairly slow rate. By 1950 Nome had 1,852 inhabitants. By 1960 the population of Nome had climbed to 2,316. At this point placer gold mining was still the leading economic activity. The local Alaska Native population was involved in ivory carving and the U.S. military had stationed troops in the city also contributing to the local economy. In 1995, Nome was &quot;connected to the Internet.&quot;

The Hope Sled Dog Race was run between Anadyr, Russia, and Nome after the fall of the Soviet Union. The race continued for more than a decade, but has not been run since approximately 2004.

==Economy==
Gold mining has been a major source of employment and revenue for Nome through to the present day. Mining&#x27;s contribution to the town was estimated at $6 million a year in 1990 (~$ in ), before a major increase in the price of gold brought renewed interest to offshore leases (where 1,000,000 ounces of gold were estimated to be in reserve) and a subsequent boom in revenues and employment.

The Discovery Channel has featured 15 seasons of &quot;Bering Sea Gold&quot; concerning offshore efforts to dredge gold both in summer and winter; in the latter season access is gained by making holes in the ice and sending a diver beneath to dredge the sea floor.

==Education==
===Higher education===

The University of Alaska Fairbanks operates a regional satellite facility in Nome called the Northwest Campus (formerly known as Northwest Community College).

===Public schools===
Nome is served by Nome Public Schools and the following public schools attended by over 720 students:
*Anvil City Science Academy, a 5–8 charter magnet, is also part of the school district.
*Extensions Correspondence School
*Nome-Beltz Junior/Senior High School, serves grades 7–12.
*Nome Elementary School, serves grades K–6.
*Nome Youth Facility.

===Private schools===
*Nome Adventist School, a private school encompassing grades 1 through 9.

==Media==
Nome&#x27;s airwaves are filled by the radio stations KNOM (780 AM, 96.1 FM) and KICY (850 AM, 100.3 FM), plus a repeater of Fairbanks&#x27; KUAC, K217CK, on 91.3 FM.

Cable television and broadband in Nome is serviced by GCI, which offers all popular cable channels, plus most of Anchorage&#x27;s television stations. Nome also has three local low-powered stations, K09OW channel 9 and K13UG channel 13 (both carrying programming from ARCS), plus K11TH channel 11 (a 3ABN owned and operated translator).

Nome is home to Alaska&#x27;s oldest newspaper, the &quot;Nome Nugget&quot;.

==Transportation==
===Airports===

Nome is a regional center of transportation for surrounding villages. There are two state-owned airports:
* Nome Airport – public-use airport located two nautical miles (3.7 km) west of the central business district of Nome, it has two asphalt paved runways: 3/21 measures 5,576 x 150 feet (1,700 × 46 m) and 10/28 is 6,001 x 150 feet (1,829 × 46 m). An $8.5 million airport improvement project is nearing completion.
* Nome City Field – a public-use airport located one nautical mile (1.85 km) north of the central business district of Nome, it has one runway designated 3/21 with a gravel surface measuring 1,950 feet. It is used by general aviation.

===Water ports===
Nome seaport is used by freight ships and cruise ships, located at 64.5°N and 165.4°W on the southern side of the Seward Peninsula in Norton Sound. The Corps of Engineers completed the Nome Harbor Improvements Project in the summer of 2006 adding a breakwater east of the existing Causeway and a spur on the end of the Causeway making it to a total of . The City Dock (south) on the Causeway is equipped with marine headers to handle the community&#x27;s bulk cargo and fuel deliveries. The City Dock is approximately in length with a depth of 22.5 feet (MLLW). The WestGold Dock (north) is in length with the same depth of 22.5 feet (ML, LW). The Westgold dock handles nearly all of the exported rock/gravel for this region and is the primary location to load/unload heavy equipment. The opening between the new breakwater and the Causeway (Outer Harbor Entrance) is approximately in width and serves as access to both Causeway deep water docks and the new Snake River entrance that leads into the Small Boat Harbor. The old entrance along the seawall has been filled in and is no longer navigable (see photos on website). Buoys outline the navigation channel from the outer harbor entrance into the inner harbor. The Nome Small Boat Harbor has a depth of 10 feet (MLLW) and offers protected mooring for recreational and fishing vessels alongside two floating docks. Smaller cargo vessels and landing craft load village freight and fuel at the east, west and south inner harbor sheet pile docks, east beach landing and west barge ramp for delivery in the region.

An addition to the Nome facility in 2005 was a concrete barge ramp located inside the inner harbor just west of the Snake River entrance. The ramp provides the bulk cargo carriers with a location closer to the causeway to trans-load freight to landing craft and roll equipment on and off barges. This location also has of uplands to be used for container, vessel and equipment storage.

===Surface transportation===

Local roads lead to Council, the Kougarok River, and Teller: the Nome-Council, Nome-Taylor, and Nome-Teller Highways, respectively. There are also smaller roads to communities up to from Nome, yet no road connection to the other major cities of Alaska. There are no railroads going to or from Nome. A road project (Manley Hot Springs–Nome) is being discussed in Alaska. It has been estimated (as of 2010) to cost $2.3 to $2.7 billion, or approximately $5 million per mile.

==Healthcare==
Local hospitals and medical centers include Norton Sound Regional Hospital and Nome Health Center. The hospital is a qualified acute care facility and medevac service. Long-term care is provided by Quyaana Care Center (a unit of the hospital). Specialized care is available through facilities such as Norton Sound Community Mental Health Center, Turning Point – Saquigvik (transitional living), and XYZ Senior Center. Nome is classified as a large town/Regional Center, it is found in EMS Region 5A in the Norton Sound Region. Emergency Services have limited highway, coastal and airport access. Emergency service is provided by 911 Telephone Service and by Nome Volunteer Ambulance Dept.

==In popular culture==
The reality television series &quot;Bering Sea Gold&quot; is set and filmed in Nome.

Nome is referenced in the songs &quot;Marry the Man Today&quot; from the 1950 Frank Loesser/Jo Swerling/Abe Burrows musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;; in &quot;A Little Brains, A Little Talent&quot; from the 1955 Richard Adler and Jerry Ross musical &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;; and in &quot;Ah, Paree!&quot; from Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s 1971 musical &quot;Follies&quot;.

Johnny Horton wrote the theme song &quot;North to Alaska&quot; for the film of the same name starring John Wayne. Nome is mentioned twice in the lyrics.

When Karen tries to buy the titular character a train ticket to the North Pole in the 1969 Rankin/Bass Christmas special &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;, Nome is mentioned by the ticket agent as one of many destinations for a northbound train.

In episode 1 of the 1997 BBC television travel series &quot;Full Circle&quot;, British actor, comedian, writer and presenter Michael Palin (of Monty Python fame) traveled to Nome and met a goldpanner on the &quot;Golden Sands of Nome&quot;.

In the video game &quot;Rainbow Six Extraction&quot;, Nome appears as one of 12 playable locations.

<text>Savoonga is a city in Nome Census Area, Alaska, United States. It is located on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea. As of the 2020 census, Savoonga&#x27;s population was 835, up from 671 in 2010.

Savoonga was incorporated in 1969. In 1971, it became joint owner of St. Lawrence Island along with the island&#x27;s only other city, Gambell.

The local economy consists largely of subsistence hunting for walrus, seals, fish, and bowhead whales. The city calls itself the &quot;Walrus Capital of the World&quot;. A dogsled mail service operated until 1963.

==History==
St. Lawrence Island has been inhabited sporadically for the past 2,000 years by both Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik and Siberian Yupik people. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the island had a population of about 4,000 in numerous villages.

Between 1878 and 1880, a famine devastated the island&#x27;s population. Many who did not starve left. The remaining population of St. Lawrence Island was nearly all Siberian Yupik.

In 1900, reindeer were introduced on the island and by 1917, the herd had grown to over 10,000 animals. A reindeer camp was established near present-day Savoonga in 1916. The village of Savoonga was established near the camp in the 1930s. Good hunting and trapping in the area attracted more residents.

Gambell and Savoonga received joint title to most of the land on St. Lawrence Island under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.

<text>Shaktoolik (, ; ) is a city in Nome Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 251, up from 230 in 2000. Shaktoolik is one of a number of Alaskan communities threatened by erosion and related global warming effects. The community has been relocated twice.

==History==
According to the Alaska Dept. of Community and Economic Development, Shaktoolik was the first and southernmost Malemiut settlement on Norton Sound, occupied as early as 1839. Twelve miles northwest, on Cape Denbigh, is the Iyatayet site that is 6,000 to 8,000 years old, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Shaktoolik was first mapped in 1842–1844 by Lt. Lavrenty Zagoskin, Imperial Russian Navy, who called it &quot;Tshaktogmyut.&quot; &quot;Shaktoolik&quot; is derived from an Unaliq word, &quot;suktuliq&quot;, meaning &quot;scattered things&quot;.

Reindeer herds were managed in the Shaktoolik area around 1905. The village was originally located six miles up the Shaktoolik River, and moved to the mouth of the River in 1933. This site was prone to severe storms and winds, however, and the village relocated to its present, more sheltered location in 1967. There are presently only two occupied dwellings at the old townsite. The City was incorporated in 1969.

==Geography==

<text>Shishmaref ( ; , or &quot;Kigiqtaq&quot;; ) is a city in the Nome Census Area, Alaska, United States. It is located on Sarichef Island in the Chukchi Sea, just north of the Bering Strait and five miles from the mainland. Shishmaref lies within the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve. The population was 563 at the 2010 census, up from 562 in 2000.

==Etymology==
Shishmaryov is probably a variant of Russian &quot;Shyshmánov&quot; from Turkic &quot;šyšman&quot; ‘fat’, but there is also Old Russian &quot;šiš&quot; ‘rogue, knave’ and &quot;Maréev&quot; ‘(son of) marine’. The name was assigned in 1821 to a nearby inlet by explorer Otto von Kotzebue of the Russian Imperial Marine, in honor of a member of his expedition, the commander Gleb S. Shishmaryov (Глеб Семёнович Шишмарёв).

In the Iñupiaq language, &quot;Qigiqtaq&quot; (formally &quot;Ḳigiḳtaḳ&quot;) means ‘island’. The water to the south of it is called &quot;Qigiqtam Imaġrua&quot; ‘waters of Qikiqtaq’, shown in the map of the area in the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (61.62%) is water.

Shishmaref was named in 1821 by explorer Lt. Otto von Kotzebue, of the Imperial Russian Navy, after Capt. Lt. Gleb Shishmaryov who accompanied him on his exploration.

Sarichef Island (on which Shishmaref is located) is part of a dynamic, 100 km-long barrier island chain that records human and environmental history spanning the past 2000 years; the oldest subaerial evidence for the formation of this system is about 1700 years before present, according to carbon 14 dating (see References, below). Erosion at Shishmaref is unique along the islands because of its fetch exposure and high tidal prism, relatively intense infrastructure development during the 20th century, and multiple shoreline defense structures built beginning in the 1970s.

=== Global warming ===
The effect of global climate change upon Shishmaref is sometimes seen as the most dramatic in the world. Rising temperatures have resulted in a reduction in the sea ice which serves to buffer Shishmaref from storm surges. At the same time, the permafrost that the village is built on has also begun to melt, making the shore even more vulnerable to erosion. In recent years the shore has been receding at an average rate of up to 10 feet (3.3 m) per year. Although a series of barricades has been put up to protect the village, the shore has continued to erode at an alarming rate. The Army Corps of Engineers has built a series of walls but none have been completely effective against waves. The town&#x27;s homes, water system and infrastructure are being undermined. Currently, Shishmaref has obtained funds to construct seawalls that protect some of the shoreline.

The village had plans to relocate several miles to the south, on the mainland to the Tin Creek site. However, Tin Creek proved unsuitable for long term settlement due to melting permafrost in the area. The Shishmaref Erosion and Relocation Coalition, made up of the city, the IRA Council and other organizations, is seeking federal, state and private funding for a move elsewhere. The cost of moving Shishmaref is estimated at $180 million, nearly $320,000 per resident. The village was told by the Obama administration that no federal money was available, therefore tensions arose in 2013 when John Kerry announced Vietnam would receive $17 million to deal with climate change.

Erosion rates along the island front exceed (and are not comparable with) those along adjacent sectors. Erosion is occurring along the entire island chain, but it is exacerbated at Sarichef Island in part because of the hydrographic impacts of hard armoring of a sandy shoreface and permafrost degradation that is accelerated by infrastructure. Residents are experiencing the effects of coastal retreat on residential and commercial properties.

Residents voted on town relocation several times, as early as 1975 and then in 2002 which approved it. On August 16, 2016, the village voted to move the town to the mainland. The town&#x27;s residents prefer to think of the move to the mainland as an &quot;expansion&quot; rather than a &quot;relocation&quot;, but although a site on the mainland called West Tin-Creek Hills was selected in 2016, there’s still a lot of planning and research to be done before that can be determined viable.

==Culture==

Sometimes referred to as &quot;the friendliest village in Alaska,&quot; Shishmaref is an Iñupiaq village. Researchers, journalists and the occasional tourist visit Shishmaref, and the city has acquired a reputation for being a gracious host.

Residents rely heavily on a subsistence lifestyle, that is, hunting and gathering much of their food. Primary food sources include sea mammals such as &quot;ugruk&quot; (bearded seal), other seals, and walrus, fish, birds (such as ptarmigan), caribou and moose. The village is well known in the region for its high-quality seal oil and fermented meat.

Shishmaref is known for its Native art. Local artists carve sculptures from whalebone and walrus ivory, that are much sought after by galleries in Alaska and the Lower 48 states. George Aden Ahgupuk (1911–2001), a prominent Iñupiaq sculptor and draftsman lived in Shishmaref.

Shishmaref was home to one of Alaska&#x27;s most-beloved dog mushers. Herbie Nayokpuk (1929–2006), known as the &quot;Shishmaref Cannonball,&quot; finished the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race numerous times, including a second-place finish.

==History==

Redoubt St. Michael was founded in 1833 by traders of the Russian-American Company, as a trading post for trade with the Yup&#x27;ik people of the area. The trading settlement and the island were named after the archangel Michael.

Fort St. Michael, a U.S. military post, was established in 1897. During the gold rush of 1897, it was a major gateway to the Alaskan interior via the Yukon River Delta (located about to the southwest). As many as 10,000 persons were said to live in St. Michael during the gold rush. St. Michael was also a popular trading post for Alaska Natives to trade their goods for Western supplies. Centralization of many Yup&#x27;iks from the surrounding villages intensified after the measles epidemic of 1900 and the influenza epidemic of 1918.

St. Michael&#x27;s population today is largely Yup&#x27;ik. Many residents are also descendants of the Russian traders.

==Economy==
The St. Michael economy is based on subsistence food harvests (hunting, fishing and gardening) supplemented by part-time wage earning. Most wage-earning positions are in city government, the IRA council and village corporation, schools and local stores. Some residents hold commercial fishing permits, primarily for the herring fishery.

The city was incorporated in 1969.

The Stebbins economy depends on commercial fishing, for herring and other fish, and subsistence fishing, gardening and hunting, supplemented by part-time wage earnings. Hunting is for seal, walrus, caribou, and beluga whale. The city government and school of about 200 students provide the only full-time positions.

The Stebbins/St. Michael Reindeer Corral Project was completed in 1993 for a herd on Stuart Island, just north of Stebbins. The reindeer are currently unmanaged.

In September 2022, a storm caused significant flooding and property damage. A November 2022 fire destroyed the town&#x27;s only store. In June 2024, a fire broke out in a shop close to the Tukurngailnguq School. The shop, the school, and several other nearby buildings were destroyed.

<doc id="105573" wikidata="Q79856" url="?curid=105573" title="Teller, Alaska">
<text>Teller ( or ) is a city in the Nome Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 229, a decrease from 268 in 2000.

It is situated on the southern half of the spit called &quot;Nuuk&quot; in Inupiaq, which separates Port Clarence Bay (see also Port Clarence, Alaska) and Grantley Harbor, at the outlet of the Imuruk Basin.

==History==

The Inupiat had a fishing camp called &quot;Nuuk&quot; south of Teller in the early 19th century. The 1825-28 Beechey expedition found three camps with a total of some 400 inhabitants and a winter camp site with burial grounds in a roughly radius around the later site of Teller on September 1, 1827.

An expedition from the Western Union telegraph spent the winter at the present site of Teller in 1866 and 1867; they called it &quot;Libbyville&quot; or &quot;Libby Station&quot;. When the United States Government introduced reindeer herding in Alaska, the Teller Reindeer Station operated from 1892 to 1900 at a nearby site. A group of experienced Sami reindeer herders and families were brought in to train the Inupiat. The station was named for United States Senator and Secretary of the Interior Henry Moore Teller in 1892 by Sheldon Jackson.

Teller was established in 1900 after the Bluestone Placer Mine discovery to the south. It took its name from the reindeer herding station. During the boom years in the early 20th century, Teller had a population of about 5,000 and was a major regional trading center. Natives from Diomede, Wales, Mary&#x27;s Igloo, and King Island came to trade there.

The Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church built Teller Mission across the harbor from Teller in 1900. The mission was renamed Brevig Mission in 1903, after the Reverend T.L. Brevig, who also served briefly as Teller&#x27;s first postmaster, a post to which he was appointed April 2, 1900.

The dirigible &quot;Norge&quot; detoured to Teller on its first flight over the North Pole from Norway to Nome in 1926. Many present residents of Teller came from Mary&#x27;s Igloo. Mary&#x27;s Igloo is now a summer fishing camp and has no permanent residents.

Today, Teller is an Inupiat village that depends on subsistence hunting and fishing.

==Geography==
Teller is located on a spit northwest of Nome on the Seward Peninsula.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (9.00%) is water.

===Climate===
Teller has a continental subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;), although its climate nearly qualifies as a tundra climate (Köppen: &quot;ETs&quot;).

== Climate change ==

All of Teller&#x27;s public and commercial buildings and two-thirds of Teller&#x27;s occupied homes are at the Townsite, a low-lying sand spit that is surrounded on three sides by water. Since the turn of the century damaging storms have been coming more often, the storms have been getting bigger, and the flooding has been getting worse. Teller has been forced to relocate its airport and landfill four miles uphill over the past three decades to escape intense erosion. In September 2005, all infrastructure on the spit, including the school, power plant, clinic, and homes, were impacted by flooding. Storms in 2009 and 2011 washed out the remaining portion of Teller&#x27;s seawall, breached the school&#x27;s sewage lagoon and flooded downtown streets with knee-deep flood waters contaminated with human waste.

==Demographics==

Teller first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. The census bureau erroneously reported the name as &quot;Fuller&quot;. It reported correctly as &quot;Teller&quot; since 1920. It was formally incorporated in 1963.

The area that is present day White Mountain began as the Eskimo fish camp &quot;Nachirvik&quot; which means &quot;mountain look-out point.&quot; The bountiful resources of both the Niukluk and the Fish rivers supported the Native populations there. The community grew with the influx of white prospectors during the Klondike Gold Rush. The first non-Native structure was a warehouse built by the miner Charles D. Lane to store supplies for his claim in the Council District. It was the site of a government-subsidized orphanage, which became an industrial school in 1926. The Covenant Church was built in 1937. A Russian Orthodox Church was built about 1920 (although no longer utilized, the church log cabin building is still standing). A post office was opened in 1932. The tribal government re-organized under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) in 1939. The city was incorporated in 1969.

Today, White Mountain is most notable as the last of three mandatory rest stops for teams competing in the annual Iditarod. All mushers are required to take an 8-hour rest stop at White Mountain before making the final push to the end of the race, away in Nome.

In February 2006, the high school building burned down as a result from a fire in the furnace room. High school and Jr. High students moved to three separate buildings and schooled there until the end of the 2008 school year. The elementary school was the oldest operating school building in Alaska up until 2009 when the new school building was completed. The old elementary building was burned down in the summer 2010 because there was no longer a use for it. The new White Mountain School is one building that has three elementary rooms for K-6 students, a Jr. High room, two Sr. High rooms, a gymnasium, a cafeteria, library, a staff room and storage rooms.

<doc id="105577" wikidata="Q1002762" url="?curid=105577" title="Alpine, Alaska">
<text>Alpine is an unincorporated community and former census-designated place in the North Slope Borough of Alaska within the  National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska on native lands. The population was 0 at the 2000 United States Census, but it was not included in the 2010 census.

Alpine is the site of a major oil drilling operation by ConocoPhillips, producing since 2000 with a peak in November 2005, further expansion in 2015 to build CD-5 and oil wells in Greater Mooses Tooth Unit 1 and 2. The infrastructure of Greater Mooses Tooth unit with pipelines, roads and mudplants to be used by the much larger Willow project located further West in the Bear Tooth Unit. Alpine is staffed primarily by commuter residents of Nuiqsut working a two-week on and two week off work schedule.

==Geography==
Alpine is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.40%, is water. It is located 8 miles north of Nuiqsut, Alaska.

== Transportation ==
The area is served by the Alpine Airstrip. The closest commercial airport is at Deadhorse.

==Demographics==

Alpine first appeared as a census-designated place (CDP) in 2000, but did not report any residents. As of the census of 2000 there were no permanent people living in the CDP, but approximately 250 workers in the work camp. Its status as a CDP was abolished as of the 2010 census.

==Oil production==
Discovered in 1994 and declared commercial in 1996, the Alpine Oil Pool was the largest oil field discovered in the US in over a decade. Development drilling began in 1998, and nine facilities modules were delivered to the North Slope via sealift during July 1999. Regular production began in November 2000. 
The Alpine Oil Pool produced an average of 97,485 BOPD during 2003 and 98,895 BOPD in 2004. Major upgrades were undertaken in 2004 to the water handling capacity and in 2005 to the oil handling, seawater injection and gas handling capacity. These upgrades enabled the production to peak at in November 2005. Since that peak, production from the pool has declined, despite continued development drilling operations and stood at an average of during first six months of 2019.

In June 2023, Alaska regulators proposed that Conoco Philips receive a 914,000$ penalty for its handling of a “shallow underground blowout” of a well in 2022, as gas was released uncontrollably at the surface for days across various locations.

===CD-5===
In the fourth quarter of 2015, oil production from a new &quot;CD-5&quot; drill on-pad site began, located to access both the Nanuq Kuparuk and the Alpine participating areas. It is part of the Colville River Unit, operated by ConocoPhillips Alaska, Inc. (78%) and a subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (22%). The CD-5 site became the first commercial oil development on Alaska Native lands within the boundaries of the  National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska on land owned by &quot;Kuukpik Corporation&quot;, the village corporation for Nuiqsut, with subsurface rights owned by Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. The CD-5 project has 33 wells, includes a 6 mile road, four bridges, 32 miles of pipelines and electrical infrastructure and cost more than $1 billion. Oil from CD-5 is processed in Alpine, then flows through Kuparuk to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. 
Alpine field production gradually increased, averaging 54,720 barrels per day in February, up from 53,007 barrels per day in January and 50,389 barrels per day year over year, from February 2021.
In 2016, ConocoPhillips planned more wells.

===Greater Mooses Tooth Unit 1 and 2===
In 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) permitted this satellite project in Greater Mooses Tooth area, west of the Colville River delta, also on lands owned by Kuukpik Corporation. In 2017, two bridges were constructed, one to carry a drilling ridge, the other to carry drill rig module. First oil was expected in late 2018.

The Greater Mooses Tooth unit 2 was planned for 48 wells, cost to exceed $1 billion with first oil expected between late-2020 and 2021.

The infrastructure of Greater Mooses Tooth unit is to be used by the much larger Willow project located further West in the Bear Tooth Unit.

<text>Anaktuvuk Pass (, , or , ) is a city in North Slope Borough, Alaska, United States. The population was 282 at the 2000 census and 324 as of the 2010 census.

==History==

Anaktuvuk Pass was named after the Anaktuvuk River. &quot;Anaktuvuk&quot; is the English way of spelling &quot;anaqtuġvik&quot;, &quot;place of caribou droppings&quot; in Inupiaq, the language of the Inupiat.

A nomadic group of Inupiat called &quot;Nunamiut&quot; lived inland in northern Alaska, hunting caribou instead of the marine mammals and fish hunted by the rest of the Inupiat, who live on the coast. The Nunamiut traded with the coastal people for other items they needed. A decline in caribou populations around 1900 and in the 1920s caused many Nunamiut to move to the coast. In 1938, several Nunamiut families moved back to the Brooks Range, around Tulugak and the Killik River. In 1949 the Killik River group moved to Tulugak Lake, 15 miles north of where the village lies today. Anaktuvuk Pass is the only Nunamiut settlement.

This settlement attracted Inupiaq people from many other locations, and villagers today lead a somewhat more sedentary lifestyle than in nomadic times. The city was incorporated in 1959. A Presbyterian church was constructed in 1966.
A federally recognized tribe is in the community: the Village of Anaktuvuk Pass (a.k.a. Naqsragmiut Tribal Council). The community population is 88.3% Alaska Natives or part Native. Anaktuvuk Pass is a Nunamiut Eskimo community dependent upon subsistence activities. Sale, importation and possession of alcohol are banned in the village.

Anaktuvuk Pass post office was established in May 1951. The first postmaster was Homer Mekiana. As of 2009, its post office was considered the most isolated in the United States.

The Nunamiut&#x27;s culture is described and preserved through photographs and artifacts at the Simon Paneak Memorial Museum in Anaktuvuk Pass.

==Economy and transportation==

Economic and employment opportunities are limited in Anaktuvuk Pass, due to its isolation. Hunting and trapping for sale of skins, guiding hunters, or making traditional caribou skin masks or clothing provides income, though some residents have sought seasonal employment outside the town.

Caribou is the primary source of meat, with other subsistence foods including trout, grayling, moose, sheep, brown bear, ptarmigan and water fowl.

Anaktuvuk Pass Airport, a gravel airstrip, is owned and operated by the North Slope Borough, and provides Anaktuvuk Pass with year-round access. A $3.4 million airport improvement project was completed by fall 1999, allowing many air companies to provide passenger flight service to Anaktuvuk Pass. There is no road to Anaktuvuk Pass, but Cat trains transport cargo from the Dalton Highway (which serves as the Trans-Alaska pipeline haul road) during the winter. Snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles are used for local transportation, though some standard vehicles are used.

==Media==
Anaktuvuk Pass is home to two low-power FM translators. K268AB (FM 101.5) is a rebroadcaster of KBRW-FM, a public radio station in Utqiaġvik and K232DU, a rebroadcast of KYKD, a religious station from Bethel. Anaktuvuk Pass also has two low-power translators of the statewide Alaska Rural Communications Service on K04IX and K09RS.

<doc id="105580" wikidata="Q79809" url="?curid=105580" title="Utqiagvik, Alaska">
<text>Utqiagvik ( ; , ), formerly known as Barrow ( ), is the borough seat and largest city of the North Slope Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. Located north of the Arctic Circle, it is one of the northernmost cities and towns in the world and the northernmost in the United States, with nearby Point Barrow as the country&#x27;s northernmost point.

Utqiagvik&#x27;s population was 4,927 at the 2020 census, an increase from 4,212 in 2010. It is the 12th-most populated city in Alaska.

==Name==

The location has been home to the Iñupiat, an indigenous Inuit ethnic group, for more than 1,500 years. The city&#x27;s Iñupiaq name refers to a place for gathering wild roots. It is derived from the Iñupiat word , also used for &quot;Claytonia tuberosa&quot; (&quot;Eskimo potato&quot;). The name was first recorded by European explorers in 1853 as &quot;Ot-ki-a-wing&quot; by Commander Rochfort Maguire, Royal Navy. John Simpson&#x27;s native map dated 1855 has the name &quot;Otkiawik&quot;, which was later misprinted on a British Admiralty chart as &quot;Otkiovik.&quot;

The former name Barrow was derived from Point Barrow and was originally a general designation because non-native Alaskan residents found it easier to pronounce than the Inupiat name. Point Barrow was named after Sir John Barrow of the British Admiralty by explorer Frederick William Beechey in 1825. A U.S. post office was established in 1901, which helped the name &quot;Barrow&quot; to become dominant.

Following a referendum approved by residents on October 6, 2016, the city&#x27;s name was formally changed from Barrow to Utqiaġvik on December 1, 2016. City Council member Qaiyaan Harcharek said the name change supports the use of the Iñupiaq language and is part of a decolonization process.

Another recorded Iñupiaq name is (), which comes from &quot;snowy owl&quot; and is translated as &quot;the place where snowy owls are hunted&quot;. A spelling variant of this name was adopted by the Ukpeaġvik Iñupiat Corporation when it was established in 1973.

==History==
===Prehistory to the 20th century===

Archaeological sites in the area indicate the Iñupiat lived around Utqiagvik as far back as 500 AD. Remains of 16 sod dwelling mounds, from the Birnirk culture of about 800 AD, can be seen on the shore of the Arctic Ocean. Located on a slight rise above the high-water mark, they risk being lost to erosion.

Bill Streever, who chairs the North Slope Science Initiative&#x27;s Science Technical Advisory Panel, wrote in his 2009 book &quot;Cold: Adventures in the World&#x27;s Frozen Places&quot;:


British Royal Navy officers came to the area to explore and map the Arctic coastline of North America. The US acquired Alaska in 1867 by purchasing it from Russia. The United States Army established a meteorological and magnetic research station at Utqiagvik in 1881.

In 1888, a Presbyterian church was built by United States missionaries at Utqiagvik. The church is still in use today. In 1889, a whaling supply and rescue station was built. It is the oldest wood-frame building in Utqiagvik and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The rescue station was converted in 1896 for use as the retail Cape Smythe Whaling and Trading Station. In the late 20th century, the building was used as Brower&#x27;s Cafe.

===20th century to the present===
A United States Post Office was opened in 1901.
In 1935, famous humorist Will Rogers and pilot Wiley Post made an unplanned stop at Walakpa Bay, south of Utqiagvik, en route to the city. As they took off again, their plane stalled and plunged into a river, killing them both. Two memorials have been erected at the location, now called the Rogers–Post Site. Another memorial is located in Utqiagvik, where the airport was renamed the Wiley Post–Will Rogers Memorial Airport in their honor.

In 1940, the Indigenous Iñupiat organized as the Native Village of Barrow Iñupiat Traditional Government (previously, Native Village of Barrow), a federally recognized Alaska Native Iñupiat &quot;tribal entity&quot; as listed by the US Bureau of Indian Affairs around 2003. They wrote a constitution and by-laws under the provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) of 1934. An IRA corporation was also created.

Utqiagvik was incorporated as a first-class city under the name Barrow in 1958. Natural gas lines were brought to the town in 1965, eliminating the need for traditional heating sources such as whale blubber.

The Barrow Duck-In was a civil disobedience event that occurred in the spring of 1961. During the Duck-in, the Iñupiat protested a federal hunting ban on ducks, which threatened their livelihood and access to food security.

The residents of the North Slope were the only Native people to vote on the acceptance of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act; they rejected it. The Act was passed in December 1971 and, despite their opposition, became law. The Ukpeaġvik Iñupiat Corporation is a for-profit village corporation established under the Act.

In 1972, the North Slope Borough was established. The borough has built sanitation facilities, water and electrical utilities, roads, and fire departments, and has established health and educational services in Utqiagvik and the villages of the North Slope with millions of dollars in new revenues from the settlement and later oil revenues.

In 1986, the North Slope Borough created the North Slope Higher Education Center. Renamed Iḷisaġvik College, it is an accredited two-year college providing education based on the Iñupiat culture and the needs of the North Slope Borough.

The Tuzzy Consortium Library, in the Iñupiat Heritage Center, serves the communities of the North Slope Borough and functions as the academic library for Iḷisaġvik College. It was named after Evelyn Tuzroyluk Higbee, an influential community leader.
Utqiagvik, like many communities in Alaska, has enacted a &quot;damp&quot; law prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages. However, the import, possession, and consumption of such beverages are still allowed.

In 1988, Utqiagvik became the center of worldwide media attention when three California gray whales became trapped in the ice offshore. After a two-week rescue effort (Operation Breakthrough), a Soviet icebreaker freed two of the whales. Journalist Tom Rose details the rescue, and the media frenzy that accompanied it, in his 1989 book &quot;Freeing The Whales&quot;. The movie &quot;Big Miracle&quot; is based on the rescue and was released on February 3, 2012.

==Geography==
Utqiagvik is roughly south of the North Pole. Only 2.6% of the Earth&#x27;s surface lies as far or farther from the equator as Utqiagvik.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are covered by water (14% of the total area). The predominant land type in Utqiagvik is tundra, which is formed over a permafrost layer that is as deep as .

Utqiagvik is surrounded by the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska.

The city of Utqiagvik has three sections, which can be classified as south, central, and north. They are known to residents as Utqiagvik, Browerville, and NARL, respectively.

* The southernmost section, known historically as the &quot;Barrow side&quot;, is the oldest and second-largest of the three; it serves as downtown. This area includes Wiley Post–Will Rogers Memorial Airport, Barrow High School, North Slope Borough School District, and Fred Ipalook Elementary School, as well as restaurants, hotels, the police station, the Utqiagvik City Hall, a Wells Fargo bank branch, and numerous houses.

* The central section is the largest of the three and is called Browerville. This has traditionally been a residential area for the City of Utqiagvik, but many businesses have opened or moved into this area in recent years. Browerville is separated from the south section by a series of lagoons, with two connecting dirt roads. In addition to houses, this area includes Tuzzy Consortium Library, the US Post Office, Eben Hopson Middle School, Samuel Simmonds Memorial Hospital, the Iñupiat Heritage Center, two grocery stores, one hotel, and two restaurants.
* The north section, the smallest and most isolated of the three, is known to residents as NARL because it was originally the site of the Naval Arctic Research Lab (NARL). It is only connected to the central section by Stevenson Street, a two-lane dirt road. The federal government transferred the NARL facility to the North Slope Borough, which adopted it as Iḷisaġvik College. This area also includes a small broadcasting station, run by the college students.

An ancient -sized crater, Avak, is situated near Utqiagvik.

===Climate===


Owing to its location north of the Arctic Circle, Utqiagvik&#x27;s climate is cold and dry, classified as a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;). Winter weather can be hazardous because of the combination of cold and wind, while summers are cool even at their warmest. Weather observation records are available for Utqiagvik, dating back to the late 19th century. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Monitoring Lab operates in Utqiagvik. The United States Department of Energy has a climate observation site in Utqiagvik as part of its Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Research Facility.

Despite the extreme northern location, temperatures at Utqiagvik are moderated by the surrounding topography. The Arctic Ocean is on three sides, and flat tundra stretches some to the south. No wind barriers or protected valleys exist where dense cold air can settle or form temperature inversions in the lower atmosphere, as commonly happens in the interior between the Brooks and the Alaska ranges.

Utqiagvik has the lowest average temperatures of cities in Alaska. Although Utqiagvik rarely records the lowest temperatures statewide during cold waves, extremely low wind chill and &quot;white out&quot; conditions from blowing snow are prevalent. Temperatures remain below freezing (32 °F or 0 °C) from early October through late May, and below from December through March.

The high temperature reaches or tops the freezing point on an average of only 136 days per year, and 92 days have a maximum at or below . Freezing temperatures and snowfall can occur during any month of the year.

As of 2023, Utqiagvik falls within USDA Hardiness Zone 2B.

Regarding precipitation, Utqiagvik has a desert climate and averages less than &quot;rainfall equivalent&quot; per year. One inch of rain has an estimated water content equal to of snow. According to 1981−2010 normals, this includes of snow, compared to for Kuujjuaq in Nunavik, Quebec, or and for much warmer Juneau and Kodiak, Alaska, respectively. Even Sable Island, at around 44 degrees latitude and under the influence of the Gulf Stream, received , or 20 percent more snowfall than Utqiagvik. Snowfall in Utqiagvik has increased in recent years, with an average annual snowfall of according to the more recent 1991–2020 normals.

The annual first snow (defined as snow that will not melt until the next spring) generally falls during the first week of October, when temperatures cease to rise above freezing during the day. October is usually the month with the heaviest snowfall, with measurable amounts occurring on over half the days and a 1991−2020 normal total accumulation of . Sunlight is around 6 hours per day by the end of October.

When the sun sets on November 18, it stays below the horizon until January 23, resulting in a polar night that lasts about 66 days. When the polar night starts, about 6 hours of civil twilight occur, with the amount decreasing each day during the first half of the polar night. On the winter solstice (around December 21 or December 22), civil twilight in Utqiagvik lasts 3 hours. After this, the amount of civil twilight increases each day to around 6 hours at the end of the polar night.

Particularly cold weather usually begins in January, and February is generally the coldest month, averaging . By March 1, the sun is up for 9 hours, and temperatures begin to warm, although winds are usually higher. Starting on March 23, astronomical night ceases to occur, with only daylight and twilight until the start of the midnight sun in May. This is also true from the end of the midnight sun at the beginning of August until September 22. April brings less extreme temperatures, with an average of , and on April 1, the sun is up for more than 14 hours. By May 1, the sun is up for 19 hours, and by May 10 or 11 (depending on the year&#x27;s relationship to the nearest leap year), the sun stays above the horizon for the entire day. This phenomenon is known as the midnight sun. The sun does not set for 83 days, until August 1 or 2 (again, depending on the year&#x27;s relationship to the nearest leap year). In May, temperatures are much warmer, averaging . On June 6, the daily mean temperature rises above freezing, and the normal daily mean temperature remains above freezing until September 21.
July is the year&#x27;s warmest month, with an average temperature of . Beginning in mid-July, the Arctic Ocean is relatively ice-free until late October. The highest temperature recorded in Utqiagvik was on July 13, 1993, while the lowest was on February 3, 1924; the highest minimum was on August 5, 2023, while the lowest maximum was on January 3, 1975. On average, during the 1991 to 2020 reference period, the coldest winter maximum was and the warmest summer minimum was . Utqiagvik records an average 26 days per year where the high reaches at least . Temperatures above are rare but have been recorded in most years. Even in July and August, the low falls to or below the freezing mark on an average of 18 days.

In addition to its low temperatures and polar night, Utqiagvik is one of the cloudiest places on Earth. Owing to the prevailing easterly winds off the Arctic Ocean, it is completely overcast slightly more than 50% of the year. It is at least 70% overcast around 62% of the time. Cloud types are mainly low stratus and fog; cumuli forms are rare. Peak cloudiness occurs in August and September when the ocean is ice-free. Dense fog occurs an average of 65 days yearly, mostly in summer. Ice fog is very common during the winter months, especially when the temperature drops below .

Wind speed variation during the year is limited, with the fall days being windiest. Extreme winds from have been recorded every month. Winds average and are typically from the east.

====Consequences of global warming====
The Arctic region is warming at a rate that is three times the global average, forcing major adjustments to life on the North Slope with regard to hunting and whaling practices over the prior millennium, as well as to habitation. Thinner sea ice endangers the landing of bowhead whale strikes on offshore ice by springtime whalers. Caribou habitat is also affected while thawing soil threatens homes and municipal and commercial structures. The city&#x27;s infrastructure is endangered, particularly water, sanitation, power, and road stability. The shoreline is rapidly eroding and has been encroaching on buildings for decades. According to Dr. Harold Wanless of the University of Miami, an anticipated rise in sea level and consequent global warming is inevitable, meaning the existence of Utqiagvik at its current location is doomed in the relative geological short term.

Whale, seal, polar bear, walrus, waterfowl, caribou, and fish are harvested from the coast or nearby rivers and lakes. Utqiagvik is the headquarters of the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, one of the Alaska Native corporations set up following the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971 to manage revenues and invest in development for their people in the region.

On August 17, 2007, the Whalers football team played their first game of the season on their new artificial-turf field. The historic game, which was attended by former Miami Dolphins player Larry Csonka, was the first live Internet broadcast of a sporting event in the United States from north of the Arctic Circle.

Since the team&#x27;s formation, it has gathered a record of 33–24, and most recently, the team reached the semifinal round of the Alaskan State Small School Football Championship.

In 2017, the Barrow High School football team won its first-ever state championship by beating the Homer Mariners 20–14.

===Basketball===

===Radio===
KBRW (AM)/KBRW-FM broadcasts in Utqiagvik on 680 kHz AM and 91.9 MHz FM. KBRW is also broadcast via FM repeaters in all of the North Slope Borough villages, from Kaktovik to Point Hope.


==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
The roads in Utqiagvik are unpaved due to the permafrost. No roads connect the city to the rest of Alaska. Utqiagvik is served by Alaska Airlines with passenger jet service at the Wiley Post–Will Rogers Memorial Airport to and from Anchorage and Fairbanks. New service between Fairbanks and Anchorage began from Era Aviation on June 1, 2009. Freight arrives by air cargo year-round and by ocean-going marine barges during the annual summer sealift.

Utqiagvik is the transportation hub for the North Slope Borough&#x27;s Arctic coastal villages. Multiple jet aircraft, with service from Deadhorse (Prudhoe Bay), Fairbanks, and Anchorage provide daily mail, cargo, and passenger services, which connect with smaller single- and twin-engine general aviation aircraft that provide regular service to other villages, from Kaktovik in the east to Point Hope in the west. The town is also served by several radio taxi services, most using small four-wheel drive vehicles.

===Health care===
Samuel Simmonds Memorial Hospital, located in the City of Utqiagvik, is the primary healthcare facility for the North Slope region of Alaska. Individuals in the city needing medical care can access the hospital by road. Because no roads lead in or out of Utqiagvik, individuals in surrounding communities and towns (including Point Hope, Prudhoe Bay, and Wainwright) must be airlifted in by plane, helicopter, or air ambulance. The facility operates continuously, and is the northernmost hospital or medical facility in the United States.

<text>Kaktovik (; , ) is a city in North Slope Borough, Alaska, United States. The population was 283 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Until the late nineteenth century, Barter Island was a major trade center for the Inupiat and was especially important as a bartering place for Inupiat from Alaska and Inuit from Canada.

Kaktovik was a traditional fishing place—&quot;Kaktovik&quot; means &quot;Seining Place&quot;—that has a large pond of good fresh water on high ground. It had no permanent settlers until people from other parts of Barter Island and northern Alaska moved to the area around the construction of a runway and Distant Early Warning Line station in the 1950s. The area was incorporated as the City of Kaktovik in 1971.

Due to Kaktovik&#x27;s isolation, the village has maintained its Inupiat Eskimo traditions. Subsistence is highly dependent upon the hunting of caribou and whale.

In the early twenty-first century, Kaktovik became a tourist destination to view polar bears. This is in part due to the native Inupiat, who are permitted to kill three bowhead whales a year, and after flensing the bodies of the whales, they leave the carcasses on the beach at the edge of town.

==Economy, commerce and social centers==
There is one commercial store in Nuiqsut, one mail receiving location (operated by the City of Nuiqsut not the United States Postal Service), and one church (Presbyterian). Other areas of social activity include the city recreation center and the school. An elder&#x27;s living center is also present.

Since 1973, Nuiqsut has an Alaska Native corporation in form of a village corporation named &quot;Kuukpik&quot;, in which more than 600 shareholders are enrolled.

Before 2001, Nuiqsut&#x27;s economy was primarily subsistence-based. When ConocoPhillips found oil and gas at the Alpine, Alaska oil field to which and Kuukpik owns the surface rights, it negotiated a surface-use agreement. Since oil production began in 2001, Kuukpik has received a small royalty from ConocoPhillips. It was the first Native village impacted in this way. The subsurface rights of the Alpine field, however, are with the regional Arctic Slope Regional Corporation.

Since May 2018, ConocoPhillips has officially requested to develop the so called Willow project oil field from the Bureau of Land Management. Kuukpik submitted comments to the draft Environmental Impact Statement reducing drill sites to four, shorter gravel roads and requesting protection of Teshekpuk Lake amongst other things. In March 2023, then Mayor Rosemary Ahtuangaruak opposed the project, because of impacts on caribou and subsistence lifestyle.

==Education==
There is one school in Nuiqsut for grades kindergarten through 12th grade, Nuiqsut Trapper School of the North Slope Borough School District. The school also provides preschool. There are approximately 100 students. There are approximately 12 teachers and 6 other staff members. Many community functions are held in the school and it serves as social center as well as school. The school facilities also serve as an emergency shelter for the community in times of power outages.

==Health==
The sale, importation, and possession of alcohol are banned in the village.

==Culture and history==
The native people of the village are Iñupiat. 
In the early 1970s, the village was re-established, when the residents moved to the region from Utqiaġvik. For one year they lived in tents while housing was built. These original residents were the first to receive dividends from the oil companies in exchange for land use. The dividends are passed from the original shareholders on to the community member of their choice (often parent to child).

Native traditions such as hunting (whale, caribou, fox, ptarmigan, etc.) and the making of native clothes and crafts continues, although the influence of modern society has reduced both need and interest in these activities to some degree. The traditional whale hunted by the whalers of Nuiqsut is the bowhead whale.

In 2022, a gas leak forced some villagers to evacuate their homes.
In 2023, Nuiqsut officials criticized the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) public input process for ConocoPhillips so called Willow project, as the BLM denied to extend the public comment period without explanation.

==Natural resources==
Nuiqsut is located in the midst of a vast quantity of oil. Many major oil companies have oil facilities in the region (ConocoPhillips, Hilcorp, etc.). The relationship with the community of Nuiqsut is such that the oil company using the land, considered to be the property of the native Nuiqsut residents (Inupiat Eskimos), pay dividends to residents in exchange for use of the land. For many native residents, the dividends are the primary, or only, source of income, but the region&#x27;s local development and global fossil fuel-generated climate disruption has had major negative impacts on their traditional hunting, fishing and whaling activities. Permafrost thawing, rising sea levels and warming of the Arctic Ocean present a cash-versus-culture conundrum to the inhabitants.

==Climate==

==In popular culture==
Nuiqsut was featured in season four episode one of the History television channel series &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot;, when a convoy of truckers delivered supplies to the village.

<doc id="105583" wikidata="Q79813" url="?curid=105583" title="Point Hope, Alaska">
<text>Point Hope (, ) is a city in North Slope Borough, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 674, down from 757 in 2000. In the 2020 Census, the population rose to 830.

Like many isolated communities in Alaska, the city has no road or rail connections to the outside world, and must be accessed by sea or by air at Point Hope Airport.

==History==

Before any modern settlement, the Ipiutak lived here.

The descriptive Inuit name of the place, &quot;Tikarakh&quot; or &quot;Tikiġaq&quot;, commonly spelled &quot;Tiagara&quot;, means &quot;forefinger&quot;. It was recorded as &quot;Tiekagagmiut&quot; in 1861 by P. Tikhmeniev Wich of the Russian Hydrographic Department and on Russian Chart 1495 it became &quot;Tiekaga&quot;. This ancient village site was advantageous, because the protrusion of Point Hope into the sea brought the whales close to the shore. At Tikigaq, they built semi-subterranean houses using mainly whalebone and driftwood. Point Hope is one of the oldest continually occupied sites in North America. While some of the earlier dwellings have been lost to erosion as the point shrinks, it still provides valuable information to archaeologists on how early Eskimos survived in their harsh environment. The Tikigaq site according to Helge Larsen is, &quot;by far the most extensive and complete one-period site yet discovered and described in the entire circumpolar region.&quot;

The first recorded Europeans to sight this cape were Russian explorers Mikhail Vasiliev and Gleb Shishmaryov of the Imperial Russian Navy on the ships &quot;Otkrietie&quot; and &quot;Blagonamierennie&quot;. Vasiliev and Shishmaryov named this landhead Mys Golovnina, after Vice Admiral Vasily Golovnin (1776–1831).

The cape at Point Hope was renamed by Captain Frederick William Beechey of the Royal Navy, who wrote on August 2, 1826: &quot;&quot;I named it Point Hope in compliment to Sir William Johnstone Hope&quot;.&quot; According to Archdeacon Stuck Hope was from a &quot;well-known house long connected with the sea&quot;. Noel Wien made the first flight here in August 1927.

Point Hope residents successfully opposed Project Chariot in 1962. The project would have involved buried thermonuclear detonations some from the village to create a deep-water artificial harbor, which would only have been usable about three months out of the year.

==Geography==
Point Hope is located in the Point Hope landhead, at the northwestern end of the Lisburne Peninsula, on the Chukchi Sea coast, southwest of Cape Lisburne, Arctic Slope at (68.347052, -166.762917). It is just above the Arctic Circle.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (1.09%) is water.

In December 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; profiled Point Hope, reporting that &quot;a surprising, and bittersweet, side effect of global warming&quot; would soon bring Point Hope &quot;one of the fastest internet connections in America&quot;. The people largely rely on traditional subsistence activities such as hunting whales. However, the melting of sea ice and thawing of permafrost as a result of global warming threaten the traditional lifestyles.

<text>Point Lay (&quot;Kali &quot;in Inupiaq- &quot;Mound&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in North Slope Borough, Alaska, United States. At the 2020 census the population was 330, up from 189 in 2010.

==Geography and climate==
Point Lay is located on the shores of the Chukchi Sea.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (11.66%) is water.

Point Lay once was on a barrier island of Kasegaluk Lagoon, but moved to the mainland near the mouth of the Kokolik River during the 1970s. A weather station was operated from October 1949 to March 1958.

Apart from its landmass that is in mainland Alaska, it also consists two peninsulas that are found on its most northwestern side.

Point Lay has a tundra climate (Koppen ET) with long, very cold winters and short, cool to mild summers.

==Demographics==
Point Lay first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated Inuit village. All 30 of its residents were Inuit. It returned again in 1890 with 77 residents, all native. It did not appear again until 1940 and again in 1950. The original settlement on the barrier island was relocated a mile to the east on the mainland in the 1970s. The new village of Point Lay returned on the 1980 U.S. Census and was made a census-designated place (CDP). It has continued to return on each successive census.

As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 189 people living in the CDP. The racial makeup of the CDP was 88.4% Native American, 10.1% White, 0.5% Pacific Islander and 0.5% from two or more races. 0.5% were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

As of the census of 2000, there were 247 people, 61 households, and 45 families living in the CDP. The population density was people per square mile (/km2). There were 67 housing units at an average density of per square mile (/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 11.34% White, 82.59% Native American, 0.40% Asian, and 5.67% from two or more races. 2.43% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 61 households, out of which 50.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 45.9% were married couples living together, 18.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.6% were non-families. 23.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 1.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.93 and the average family size was 4.57.

In the CDP, the age distribution of the population shows 46.2% under the age of 18, 9.3% from 18 to 24, 24.7% from 25 to 44, 17.0% from 45 to 64, and 2.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 21 years. For every 100 females, there were 135.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 133.3 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $68,750, and the median income for a family was $75,883. Males had a median income of $46,071 versus $25,625 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $18,003. About 11.4% of families and 7.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.1% of those under the age of eighteen and none of those 65 or over.

==Lifestyle and economy==

The village has an annual hunt of beluga whales within the Kasegaluk Lagoon. On the Fourth of July, a parade runs through town led by the fire engines and ambulances of the town&#x27;s modern fire department.

The Inupaiq name for the village is Kali, which means &quot;mound&quot;, after a raised area on the barrier island where the old village stood. The school and fire department bear the name Kali.

The Kali school is a part of the North Slope Borough School District.

==Military radar==

Until recently, a cluster of radar dishes existed near Point Lay. These were a part of the Distant Early Warning Line, a system of defensive radar installations built during the Cold War. The station was decommissioned during the 1990s, and the radar dishes were dismantled sometime between 2004 and 2006.

<text>Prudhoe Bay is a census-designated place (CDP) located in North Slope Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. As of the 2020 census, the population of the CDP was 1,310 people, down from 2,174 residents in the 2010 census, and up from just 5 residents in 2000; however, at any given time, several thousand transient workers support the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field. The airport, lodging and general store are located in Deadhorse, and the rigs and processing facilities are located on scattered gravel pads laid atop the tundra. It is only during winter that the surface is hard enough to support heavy equipment, and new construction happens at that time.

Overland access is by the Dalton Highway. As the bay itself is still further north through a security checkpoint, open water is not visible from the highway. A few tourists, arriving by bus or their own vehicles after a two-day ride up the Dalton Highway from Fairbanks, come to see the tundra, the Arctic Ocean and the midnight sun, staying in lodgings assembled from modular buildings. Tours must be arranged in advance to see the Arctic Ocean and the bay itself.

Prudhoe Bay was named in 1826 by British explorer Sir John Franklin after his classmate Captain Algernon Percy, Baron Prudhoe. Franklin traveled westerly along the coast from the mouth of the Mackenzie River in Canada almost to Point Barrow.

==Geography==
Prudhoe Bay is located on the Sagavanirktok River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of of which, is land and is water. The total area is 25.40% water.

==Climate==
Prudhoe Bay, along with similar communities on the North Slope of Alaska, features a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;). Winters are long and frigid, and because the area is above the Arctic Circle, the sun does not rise during several weeks of each winter. Summers bring long daylight hours, with 24 hours of daylight during some summer weeks, but are still cool, being mostly between and sometimes dropping to the freezing point.

==Demographics==
Prudhoe Bay first appeared on the 1970 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It was made a census-designated place (CDP) in 1980.

As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 2,174 people living in the CDP. The racial makeup of the CDP was 83.0% White, 1.9% Black, 7.5% Native American, 1.5% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.3% from some other race and 1.6% from two or more races. 4.0% were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

==Health care==
Prudhoe Bay is classified as an isolated town/sub-regional center. It is found in EMS Region 6A in the North Slope Region. Emergency services have limited highway, coastal and airport access. Emergency service is provided by a paid emergency medical services unit and Fairweather Deadhorse Medical Clinic. Auxiliary health care is provided by oil company medical staff and the Greater Prudhoe Bay Fire Dept. Individuals requiring hospital care are usually transported to the nearest hospital/medical center, Sammuel Simmonds Memorial Hospital, in Utqiaġvik. Because no roads connect Prudhoe Bay to Utqiaġvik, patients are transported by helicopter or air ambulance (a flight of approximately 45 minutes).

<text>Wainwright (; &quot;Ulġuniq&quot; in Iñupiaq), also known as Ulguniq or Kuuk, is a city in North Slope Borough, Alaska, United States. At the 2020 census the population was 628, making it the third largest city in the North Slope Borough, up from 556 in 2010. The community was named after Wainwright Lagoon, which in turn was named after Lt. John Wainwright, an officer under Capt. F. W. Beechey, who were the first non-native people to travel to the lagoon in 1826. An unincorporated area known as Wainwright Inlet by 1890, Wainwright was founded as an incorporated municipality in 1904.

==Geography and climate==

Wainwright is located on the Chukchi Sea about southwest of Utqiaġvik.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (58.63%) is water.

Wainwright has a dry-winter Arctic climate (Köppen ETw) with temperatures ranging from . There is little precipitation, mostly snow; however, the dry winters make the annual snowfall totals more modest than they would otherwise be. The Chukchi Sea is unfrozen from early July to late September.

==Demographics==

Wainwright first appeared on the 1890 U.S. Census as the unincorporated area of &quot;Wainwright Inlet.&quot; This included the native settlement Kugmiut, camps on Kug River, Setorokamiut, Nuklwok, Nutnago and Shinnowok. All 72 residents were native. It did not appear again on the census until 1920, this time as Wainwright. It was formally incorporated in 1962.

As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 556 people living in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 90.1% Native American, 7.9% White and 1.6% from two or more races. 0.4% were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

At the 2000 census, there were 546 people, 148 households and 117 families living in the city. The population density was . There were 179 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 6.78% White, 0.18% Black or African American, 90.29% Native American, and 2.75% from two or more races.

There were 148 households, of which 50.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.7% were married couples living together, 16.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.3% were non-families. 18.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

<doc id="105587" wikidata="Q184535" url="?curid=105587" title="Sofya Kovalevskaya">
<text>Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya (; born Korvin-Krukovskaya; – 10 February 1891) was a Russian mathematician who made noteworthy contributions to analysis, partial differential equations and mechanics. She was a pioneer for women in mathematics around the world – the first woman to earn a doctorate (in the modern sense) in mathematics, the first woman appointed to a full professorship in northern Europe and one of the first women to work for a scientific journal as an editor. According to historian of science Ann Hibner Koblitz, Kovalevskaya was &quot;the greatest known woman scientist before the twentieth century&quot;.

Historian of mathematics Roger Cooke writes:
Her sister was the socialist Anne Jaclard.

There are several alternative transliterations of her name. She herself used Sophie Kowalevski (or occasionally Kowalevsky) in her academic publications. In Sweden she was known as Sonja Kovalevsky; Sonja (Russian ) is her Russian nickname.

==Background and early education==
Sofya Kovalevskaya (&quot;née&quot; Korvin-Krukovskaya) was born in Moscow, the second of three children. Her father, Lieutenant General , served in the Imperial Russian Army as head of the Moscow Artillery before retiring to Polibino, his family estate in Pskov Oblast in 1858, when Kovalevskaya was eight years old. He was a member of the minor Russian nobility, of mixed Belarussian–Polish descent (Polish on his father&#x27;s side), with possible partial ancestry from the royal Corvin family of Hungary, and served as Marshall of Nobility for Vitebsk province. (There may also have been some Romani ancestry on the father&#x27;s side.)

Her mother, Yelizaveta Fedorovna von Schubert (1820–1879), descended from a family of German immigrants to St. Petersburg who lived on Vasilievsky Island. Her maternal great-grandfather was the astronomer and geographer Friedrich Theodor von Schubert (1758–1825), who emigrated to Russia from Germany around 1785. He became a full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science and head of its astronomical observatory. His son, Kovalevskaya&#x27;s maternal grandfather, was General Theodor Friedrich von Schubert (1789–1865), who was head of the military topographic service, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as Director of the Kunstkamera museum.

Kovalevskaya&#x27;s parents provided her with a good early education. At various times, her governesses were native speakers of English, French, and German. When she was 11 years old, she was intrigued by a foretaste of what she was to learn later in her lessons in calculus; the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes by Ostrogradsky, left over from her father&#x27;s student days. She was tutored privately in elementary mathematics by Iosif Ignatevich Malevich.

The physicist Nikolai Nikanorovich Tyrtov noted her unusual aptitude when she managed to understand his textbook by discovering for herself an approximate construction of trigonometric functions which she had not yet encountered in her studies. Tyrtov called her a &quot;new Pascal&quot; and suggested she be given a chance to pursue further studies under the tutelage of . In 1866–67 she spent much of the winter with her family in St. Petersburg, where she was provided private tutoring by Strannoliubskii, a well-known advocate of higher education for women, who taught her calculus. During that same period, the son of a local priest introduced her sister Anna to progressive ideas influenced by the radical movement of the 1860s, providing her with copies of radical journals of the time discussing Russian nihilism.

Although the word &quot;nihilist&quot; (нигилист) often was used in a negative sense, it did not have that meaning for the young Russians of the 1860s (шестидесятники):

Despite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russia and most other countries. In order to study abroad, Kovalevskaya needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, in 1868 she contracted a &quot;fictitious marriage&quot; with Vladimir Kovalevskij, a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical, who was the first to translate and publish the works of Charles Darwin in Russia. They moved from Russia to Germany in 1869, after a brief stay in Vienna, in order to pursue advanced studies.

==Student years==

In April 1869, following Sofia&#x27;s and Vladimir&#x27;s brief stay in Vienna, where she attended lectures in physics at the university, they moved to Heidelberg. Through great efforts, she obtained permission to audit classes with the professors&#x27; approval at the University of Heidelberg. There she attended courses in physics and mathematics under such teachers as Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen. Vladimir, meanwhile, went on to the University of Jena to pursue a doctorate in paleontology.

In October 1869, shortly after attending courses in Heidelberg, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues Thomas Huxley and Charles Darwin, while she was invited to attend George Eliot&#x27;s Sunday salons. There, at age nineteen, she met Herbert Spencer and was led into a debate, at Eliot&#x27;s instigation, on &quot;woman&#x27;s capacity for abstract thought&quot;. Although there is no record of the details of their conversation, she had just completed a lecture course in Heidelberg on mechanics, and she may just possibly have made mention of the Euler equations governing the motion of a rigid body (see following section). George Eliot was writing &quot;Middlemarch&quot; at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: &quot;In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke&#x27;s mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.&quot; This was well before Kovalevskaya&#x27;s notable contribution of the &quot;Kovalevskaya top&quot; to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section).

In October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began to take private lessons with Karl Weierstrass, since the university would not allow her even to audit classes. He was very impressed with her mathematical skills, and over the subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university.

In 1871 she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to help in the Paris Commune, where Kovalevskaya attended the injured and her sister Anyuta was active in the Commune. With the fall of the Commune, however, both Anyuta and her common law husband Victor Jaclard, who was leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard and a prominent Blanquiste, were arrested. Although Anyuta managed to escape to London, Jaclard was sentenced to execution. However, with the assistance of Sofia&#x27;s and Anyuta&#x27;s father General Krukovsky, who had come urgently to Paris to help Anyuta and who wrote to Adolphe Thiers asking for clemency, Jaclard was saved.

Kovalevskaya returned to Berlin and continued her studies with Weierstrass for three more years. In 1874 she presented three papers—on partial differential equations, on the dynamics of Saturn&#x27;s rings, and on elliptic integrals—to the University of Göttingen as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, after Weierstrass succeeded in having her exempted from the usual oral examinations.

Kovalevskaya thereby became the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate (in the modern sense of the word) in mathematics. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem, which proves the existence and analyticity of local solutions to such equations under suitably defined initial/boundary conditions.

==Last years in Germany and Sweden==

In 1874, Kovalevskaya and her husband Vladimir returned to Russia, but Vladimir failed to secure a professorship because of his radical beliefs. (Kovalevskaya never would have been considered for such a position because of her gender.) During this time they tried a variety of schemes to support themselves, including real estate development and involvement with an oil company. But in the late 1870s they faced serious financial problems, leading to bankruptcy.

In 1875, for some unknown reason, perhaps the death of her father, Sofia and Vladimir decided to spend several years together as an actual married couple. Three years later their daughter, Sofia (called &quot;Fufa&quot;), was born. After almost two years devoted to raising her daughter, Kovalevskaya put Fufa under the care of relatives and friends, resumed her work in mathematics, and left Vladimir for what would be the last time.

Vladimir, who had always suffered severe mood swings, became more unstable. In 1883, faced with worsening mood swings and the possibility of being prosecuted for his role in a stock swindle, Vladimir committed suicide.

That year, with the help of the mathematician Gösta Mittag-Leffler, whom she had known as a fellow student of Weierstrass, Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a &quot;privat-docent&quot; at Stockholm University in Sweden. Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler&#x27;s sister, the actress, novelist, and playwright Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler. Until Kovalevskaya&#x27;s death the two women shared a close friendship.

In 1884 Kovalevskaya was appointed to a five-year position as Extraordinary Professor (assistant professor in modern terminology) and became an editor of Acta Mathematica. In 1888 she won the &quot;Prix Bordin&quot; of the French Academy of Science, for her work &quot;Mémoire sur un cas particulier du problème de la rotation d&#x27;un corps pesant autour d&#x27;un point fixe, où l&#x27;intégration s&#x27;effectue à l&#x27;aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps&quot;. Her submission featured the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the &quot;Kovalevskaya top&quot;, which was subsequently shown to be the only other case of rigid body motion that is &quot;completely integrable&quot; other than the tops of Euler and Lagrange.

In 1889 Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at Stockholm University, the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a position. After much lobbying on her behalf (and a change in the academy&#x27;s rules) she was made a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, but she was never offered a professorship in Russia.

Kovalevskaya, who was involved in the progressive political and feminist currents of late nineteenth-century Russian nihilism, wrote several non-mathematical works as well, including a memoir, &quot;A Russian Childhood&quot;, two plays (in collaboration with Duchess Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler) and a partly autobiographical novel, &quot;Nihilist Girl&quot; (1890).

In 1889, Kovalevskaya fell in love with Maxim Kovalevsky, a distant relation of her deceased husband, but insisted on not marrying him because she would not be able to settle down and live with him.

Kovalevskaya died of flu complicated by pneumonia in 1891 at age forty-one, after returning from a vacation in Nice with Maxim. She is buried in Solna, Sweden, at Norra begravningsplatsen.

Kovalevskaya&#x27;s mathematical results, such as the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem, and her pioneering role as a female mathematician in an almost exclusively male-dominated field, have made her the subject of several books, including a biography by Ann Hibner Koblitz, a biography in Russian by Polubarinova-Kochina (translated into English by M. Burov with the title &quot;Love and Mathematics: Sofya Kovalevskaya&quot;, Mir Publishers, 1985), and a book about her mathematics by R. Cooke.

==Tributes==
Sonya Kovalevsky High School Mathematics Day is a grant-making program of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), funding workshops across the United States which encourage girls to explore mathematics. While the AWM currently does not have grant money to support this program, multiple universities continue the program with their own funding.

The Kovalevsky Lecture is sponsored annually by the AWM and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and is intended to highlight significant contributions of women in the fields of applied or computational mathematics.

The Kovalevskaia Fund, founded in 1985 with the purpose of supporting women in science in developing countries, was named in her honor.

The lunar crater Kovalevskaya is named in her honor.

A gymnasium in Velikiye Luki and a progymnasium in Vilnius are named after Sofya Kovalevskaya.

The Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation of Germany bestows a bi-annual Sofia Kovalevskaya Award to promising young researchers.

Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and Stockholm have streets named in honor of Kovalevskaya.

On 30 June 2021, a satellite named after her (ÑuSat 22 or &quot;Sofya&quot;, COSPAR 2021-059AS) was launched into space as part of the Satellogic Aleph-1 constellation.

==In film==
Kovalevskaya has been the subject of three film and TV biographies.

* &quot;Sofya Kovalevskaya&quot; (1956) directed by Iosef Shapiro, starring Yelena Yunger, Lev Kolesov and Tatyana Sezenyevskaya.
* &quot;Berget på månens baksida&quot; (&quot;A Hill on the Dark Side of the Moon&quot;) (1983) directed by Lennart Hjulström, starring Gunilla Nyroos as Sofja Kovalewsky and Bibi Andersson as Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler, Duchess of Cajanello, and sister to Gösta Mittag-Leffler.
* &quot;Sofya Kovalevskaya&quot; &quot;(1985 TV)&quot; directed by Azerbaijani director Ayan Shakhmaliyeva, starring Yelena Safonova as Sofia.

<doc id="105588" wikidata="Q602422" url="?curid=105588" title="Ambler, Alaska">
<text>Ambler (, ) is a city in Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 258, down from 309 in 2000. The city is located in the large Iñupiaq language speaking region of Alaska, and the local dialect is known as the Ambler dialect (related to the Shugnak dialect). , over 91% of the community speaks and understands the language (Kraus, 1999), with many young children actively learning the language in school. It has important relationships with the &quot;hub&quot; city of Kotzebue, Alaska and has important relationships with Maniilaq Health Association.

==Geography==
Ambler is located at , on the north bank of the Kobuk River, near the confluence of the Ambler and the Kobuk Rivers. It lies 45 miles north of the Arctic Circle. It is 138 miles northeast of Kotzebue, 30 miles northwest of Kobuk and 30 miles downriver from Shungnak. Ambler is located in the Kotzebue Recording District.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (11.91%) is water.

==Climate==
Ambler is located in the continental climate zone. Temperatures have ranged from 93F to -74F. The Kobuk River is navigable from early June to mid-October. Ambler has a subarctic climate with long, extremely cold winters and short, warm summers. Temperatures in the winter often drop below -40 °C/°F, just like most of interior Alaska, but it frequently gets mild spells where the temperatures stay above 10 °F (-12 °C) for several days in a row because of the relative closeness to the Pacific Ocean. It occasionally gets above freezing in winter, even in January, although it is not very common. Places further East like Fairbanks and Fort Yukon, for comparison, are usually lightly affected by the mild Pacific air. Ambler is also wetter because of this. Summers are quite variable too, as the weather alternates between warm days and cooler days. The highest temperature of any given year is about 80 °F (26 °C) and occasionally above 86 °F (30 °C), occurring as recently as June 18 and 19, 2013 with a maximum temperature of 90 °F (32 °C) recorded on both days.
Below is a table containing data for the period 1981-1992:

==History==

The community was named for a tributary of the Kobuk River, which was named for Dr. James M. Ambler, who died of starvation after his ship was trapped in the Arctic ice in 1881. Ambler was permanently settled in 1958 when people from Shungnak and Kobuk moved downstream because of the variety of fish, wild game and spruce trees in the area. An archaeological site is located nearby at Onion Portage. A post office was established in 1963 First Post Master was Sarah Tickett. The city was incorporated in 1971. The story of the prophet Maniilaq states that he predicted in the future a great whale would swim upriver and arrive at Ambler. Founding fathers were Harry Tickett, Truman Cleveland, Nelson Greist Sr, Mark Cleveland, Tommy Lee, Charlie Douglas and Tommy Douglas. Current 2023 Ambler IRA President Miles Cleveland Sr.

<text>Kiana ( or ) is a city in Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 361, down from 388 in 2000.

==History==

===Before contact===
Kiana, meaning where three rivers meet, was founded several centuries ago. Before Kiana became a village, the Inupiat tended to travel with certain animal herds; constantly hunting for meat and furs.

In the 1800s, the Inupiaqs of Kiana used to live along the Kobuk River. Throughout the year the villagers hunted and fished near their houses. They moved to an area where there was an abundance of animals and fish. The Inupiaqs lived in houses made of sod; that is because they would follow where the animals would go.

When someone died inside the house they abandoned it, believing they would catch a contagious disease. Instead of building coffins or digging graves, the villagers wrapped the bodies of the deceased in cloths; they put poles in the cloths making the shape of a teepee.

Archaeological studies have been done on the local site &#x27;Igliqtiqsiugvigruaq&#x27; (Swift Water Place) which was inhabited by the ancestors of the present day residents of Kiana from 1790 to 1810. The town consisted of burrowed homes connected by tunnels.

===Early 20th century===
 The first white people arrived from the south with boats in 1898 and changed the way of life. They settled in what is now Kiana. More white people came in 1901 and 1902 and started building houses. Inupiaq women moved to them and married the men.

 Archaeologists have discovered a pre-contact Inupiaq village near Kiana. From carbon dating, the archaeologists discovered the village was from the late 1700s to the early 1800s. After more digging was done, they found that some of the houses they excavated were connected with tunnels and passageways. The average house size in the village was about the size of typical one-roomed cabins. Some of the artifacts that were found include metal fragments and shards, as well as glass beads.

Kiana is the central village of the Kobuk river, for Kowagmiut Inupaiq Eskimos. Kiana became known to the Federal Government after a population increase, eventually making the town in to a city, in the year 1915. A United States Post Office was founded in the year 1964.

Before the post office was built, mail came only once a month. The mail transportation method was mainly by dogsled or by walking from one village to another. During that time, Kiana became a key supply city for coal and gold miners who were posted along the Squirrel River. The Blankenship Trading Post was managed by Walter Blankenship, and later by Robinson Blankenship and Ruth Blankenship Sandvik. The trading post was the only store with goods such as flour, salt, carbonated beverages, coffee, tea, sugar, and fruit, both dried and canned.

==Language==

 The first villages in the region to start teaching the Inupiaq language in public school were Ambler, Shungnak, and Kobuk. Noorvik and the other villages around the region began teaching it as well. Viola Barr and Rosaline Jackson were the first people in Kiana to teach Inupiaq language in a classroom in 1971.
 Before white people came to the region, the children of Kiana grew up speaking the Inupiaq language. Most Kiana students and adults do not know how to read, write, or speak the language. The region is trying to get more people to speak the language so many more townspeople will be able to speak Inupiaq. Rosetta Stone and the Inupiaq Language Commission help with the effort.

==Geography==

==Climate==

 The snowfall is significant with about 60 inches per year and the rainfall is 16 inches on average. The Kobuk River is navigable by boat from May to October; it is frozen for the remainder of the year.

==Demographics==

==Politics==
Kiana has a city administrator who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the facilities and to carry out the vision and the mission that is set forth by the City Council and the Mayor who are both elected by the citizens. The mayor&#x27;s responsibility is to help set the focus of the Council.

Tom Cyrus was mayor of Kiana for 7 years, from 2003 to 2010. During that time, the city and traditional council worked closely. They chose to merge the two governments and formed a joint council since they were working with similar visions. The merged organization of governments held joint council meetings and planning sessions. They had one executive director, one accountant, and a city clerk. All administrative positions were moved into one building and they streamlined costs by not duplicating services. At that time, there was limited funding available to municipal governments and there were more opportunities for money through BIA funds and tribal government. In 2009, the goals began to change and it was decided to separate the two governments, with the goal of making the city and traditional governments financially solvent again.

Some of the issues that the mayor deals with include looking for funding, supervising the water and sewer plant, managing the village power, and dealing with wildlife in the community. The mayor also has to assist the council and community with long range planning.
Kiana&#x27;s current mayor, Brad Reich, became mayor when Tom Cyrus resigned in 2009. The full resignation took a year to go into effect and Reich become mayor.

==Education==
The Kiana School, operated by the Northwest Arctic Borough School District, serves the community. it has 123 students, with Alaska natives making up 97% of the student body.

==Transportation==
There are several types and uses of transportation in and around Kiana which include travel over land and water. Types of land transportation used by the people in Kiana are all terrain vehicles, cars, trucks, and snow machines. They are used for getting around the village and just riding around.

Some vehicles are used to travel between villages. In the winter, an ice road is usually plowed or formed on the Kobuk River from Kiana to Noorvik; it extends all the way to Kotzebue. In the summer, the people of Kiana use the same routes on motor boats to get to other villages.

In all seasons, people use bush airplanes to get to all other villages in the region. Bob Baker Memorial Airport is located one mile from the city. Bering Air and Ravn Air provide service to Kotzebue and other locations. The barge system which services Kiana is Crowley Marine Services. CMS goes to Kiana every summer, bringing gas, fuel, and other products. Store owners use large boats to ship goods upriver.

The costs for transportation are very significant. For example, buying tickets on a bush plane and fuel costs are high. Bering Air charges $324 for round trip fare to Kotzebue, and $180 round trip to Noorvik. Ravn Air tickets are $240 round trip to Kotzebue and $160 round both ways to Noorvik. Gas prices vary. At the Kiana City Office, it costs $7.21 including tax for a gallon of gas. At Lee&#x27;s Sea Air (the store in Kiana), it&#x27;s $12 for a gallon.

<text>Kivalina () is a city and village in Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska, United States. The population was 377 at the 2000 census and 374 as of the 2010 census.

The island on which the village lies is threatened by rising sea levels and coastal erosion caused by climate change. , it is predicted that the island will be inundated by 2025. In addition to well-publicized impacts of climate change, the Village of Kivalina has been a party in several environmentally related court cases.

==History==
Kivalina is an Inupiat community first reported as &quot;Kivualinagmut&quot; in 1847 by Lt. Lavrenty Zagoskin of the Imperial Russian Navy. It has long been a stopping place for travelers between Arctic coastal areas and Kotzebue Sound communities. Three bodies and artifacts were found in 2009 representing the Ipiutak culture, a pre-Thule, non-whaling civilization that disappeared over a millennium ago.

It is the only village in the region where people hunt the bowhead whale. The original village was located at the north end of the Kivalina Lagoon, but was relocated.

In about 1900, reindeer were brought to the area and some people were trained as reindeer herders.

An airstrip was built at Kivalina in 1960. Kivalina incorporated as a second-class city in 1969. During the 1970s, a new school and an electric system were constructed in the city.

On December 5, 2014, the only general store in Kivalina burned down. In July 2015, a newer store was opened after months of rebuilding to make the store more convenient and safe.

==Geography==
Kivalina is on the southern tip of a long barrier island located between the Chukchi Sea and a lagoon at the mouth of the Kivalina River. It lies northwest of Kotzebue.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (51.55%) is water.

==Climate==
Kivalina has a dry subarctic climate with long very cold winters and short cool summers. August is the wettest month of the year, while December is the snowiest month.

==Demographics==

Kivalina first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated (native) village. It formally incorporated in 1969.

As of the census of 2010, there were 374 people, and 99 households. The population density was . There were 80 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 3.45% White and 96.55% Native American. The Native Village of Kivalina is a federally recognized tribe with an elected tribal council. The City of Kivalina, organized under the Northwest Arctic Borough under the State of Alaska, has an elected mayor and city administrator and a 7-member city council. Per the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, NANA Corporation owns the surface and sub-surface rights to the city site and surrounding area. Manilaaq Association serves the community as an Alaska Native non-profit regional corporation providing social, tribal and health care services.

In 2010, there were 78 households, out of which 61.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 62.8% were married couples living together, 15.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 17.9% were non-families. 16.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.83 and the average family size was 5.50. In the village the population was spread out, with 44.0% under the age of 18, 13.3% from 18 to 24, 20.7% from 25 to 44, 15.9% from 45 to 64, and 6.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 21 years. For every 100 females, there were 106.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 113.1 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $30,833, and the median income for a family was $30,179. Males had a median income of $31,875 versus $21,875 for females. The per capita income for the village was $8,360. About 25.4% of families and 26.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.9% of those under age 18 and 30.0% of those age 65 or over.

==Environmental issues==
Due to severe sea wave erosion during storms, the city hopes to relocate again to a new site from the present site; studies of alternate sites are ongoing. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the estimated cost of relocation runs between $95 and $125 million, whereas the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates it to be between $100 and $400 million. Since the temperatures in the Arctic as rising is it heavily impacting the Kivalina community. The sea ice that was once there helping to protect the city has now disappeared. Due to these rising sea levels maybe people are out of homes and since resources are becoming scarce it is leading to overcrowding and poor sanitation.

In 2011, Haymarket Books published &quot;Kivalina: A Climate Change Story&quot; by Christine Shearer.

===&quot;Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corporation&quot;===
The city of Kivalina and a federally recognized tribe, the Alaska Native Village of Kivalina, sued ExxonMobil, eight other oil companies, 14 power companies and one coal company in a lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco on February 26, 2008, claiming that the large amounts of greenhouse gases they emit contribute to global warming that threatens the community&#x27;s existence. The lawsuit estimated the cost of relocation at $400 million. The suit was dismissed by the United States district court on September 30, 2009, on the grounds that regulating greenhouse emissions was a political rather than a legal issue and one that needed to be resolved by Congress and the Administration rather than by courts.

=== &quot;Kivalina v Teck Cominco&quot; ===
In 2004, Kivalina underrepresentation from the co-founder of Center on Race Poverty and Environment, Luke Cole, sued Canadian mining company Teck Cominco, operator of the Red Dog Mine, for polluting its water drinking water source and subsistence fish resources through their discharge of mine waste into the Wulik River. Teck Cominco settled the suit in 2008 by agreeing to build a wastewater pipeline from the mine to the ocean that would bypass discharging into the Wulik River. However, the pipeline was not constructed and the alternative settlement clause was followed.

=== &quot;Kivalina v. US EPA&quot; ===
In 2010, the Native Village of Kivalina IRA Council brought suit against the US EPA for failing to adequately address public comments in their permitting of the Red Dog Mine discharge plan under the National Pollutant Discharge Elilmination System (NPDES). In 2012, the US Ninth Circuit court upheld the decision of the EPA Appeals Board to not review the permit, citing the insufficiency of the Tribe&#x27;s argument.

===Orange goo===
On August 4, 2011, it was reported that residents of the city of Kivalina had seen a strange orange goo wash up on the shores. According to the Associated Press, &quot;Tests have been conducted on the substance on the surface of the water in Kivalina. City Administrator Janet Mitchell told the Associated Press that the substance has also shown up in some residents&#x27; rain buckets.&quot; On August 8, 2011, Associated Press reported that the substance consisted of millions of microscopic eggs. Later, officials of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirmed that the orange colored materials were some kind of crustacean eggs or embryos, but subsequent examination resulted in a declaration that the substance consisted of spores from a possibly undescribed species of rust fungus, later revealed to be &quot;Chrysomyxa ledicola&quot;.

=== Sea level rise and coastal erosion ===
On numerous occasions the community has been inundated by storm surges and been forced to evacuate. While the risk of inundation from sea water has always existed, storms caused extensive flooding in 1970, 1976, 2002, 2004, and spurred a village-wide evacuation in 2007. To slow erosion, the US Army Corps of Engineers conducted a rip-rap revetment project along the tip of the barrier island and adjacent to the airport.

=== Other climate change impacts ===
In addition to increased flooding from storm surges, bank erosion along the Wulik River causes increased turbidity which affects the city&#x27;s drinking water source and complicates water treatment.

== Relocation ==
Due to severe sea wave erosion during storms, the city hopes to relocate again to a new site 12 km (7.5 mi) from the present site. In 2009, Kivalina was identified by a GAO report as one of 31 environmentally threatened communities in Alaska. Relocation to a site off the barrier island to higher ground has had little progress. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the estimated cost of relocation runs between $95 and $125 million, whereas the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates it to be between $100 and $400 million. In 2018, a decision was made to build an evacuation road across the Kivalina Lagoon to provide a means for the community to escape devastating storms that can inundate the barrier island. Additionally, the road will connect the village with the proposed new school site on K-Hill.

== Kivalina in the media ==
Kivalina&#x27;s environmental issues were prominently featured in The 2015 Weather Channel documentary &quot;Alaska: State of Emergency&quot; hosted by Dave Malkoff. Kivalina was one of the two towns featured in the Al Jazeera English &quot;Fault Lines&quot; documentary, &quot;When the Water Took the Land.&quot; The community, who were originally nomadic, were given an ultimatum that they would have to settle in the permanent community or their children would be taken from them. The village&#x27;s plight was also examined in &quot;Kivalina&quot;, an hourlong documentary released as part of the PBS World series &quot;America ReFramed&quot;. The Atlantic did a photo journalism story documenting climate change in Kivalina in their September 2019 article, &quot;The Impact of Climate Change on Kivalina, Alaska&quot;.

==Education==
The McQueen School, operated by the Northwest Arctic Borough School District, serves the community. it had 141 students, with Alaska Natives making up 100% of the student body.

<text>Kobuk () is a city in Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 151, up from 109 in 2000.

==History==
Kobuk was founded in 1899 as the village of Shungnak, a supply point for miners north of the Kobuk River in the Cosmos Hills. A trading post, school, and mission were built and residents came to the settlement. In the 1920s, river erosion led many residents to relocate ten miles downstream (west) to a site called &quot;Kochuk.&quot; Kochuk became the new Shungnak, while the original Shungnak became Kobuk in 1928.

In May 1973, a flood covered the entire village. In September of the same year, it incorporated as a city.

The economy of Kobuk is based on subsistence hunting for caribou and moose.

With the departure of many residents in 1927 to the &quot;New&quot; Shungnak site, the old site was renamed Kobuk in 1928. It did not appear on the 1930 census, but did beginning again in 1940. In 1970, Kobuk was erroneously reported as the unincorporated &quot;Shungnak Village&quot; (not to be confused with its neighbor city). In 1973, Kobuk was formally incorporated and has reported as Kobuk in every successive census since 1980.

As of the census of 2000, there were 109 people, 26 households, and 23 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 45 housing units at an average density of .

<text>Kotzebue ( ) or Qikiqtaġruk ( , ) is a city in the Northwest Arctic Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is the borough&#x27;s seat, by far its largest community and the economic and transportation hub of the subregion of Alaska encompassing the borough. The population of the city was 3,102 as of the 2020 census, down from 3,201 in 2010.

==History==
===Etymology and prehistory===
Owing to its location and relative size, Kotzebue served as a trading and gathering center for the various communities in the region. The Noatak, Selawik and Kobuk Rivers drain into the Kotzebue Sound near Kotzebue to form a center for transportation to points inland. In addition to people from interior villages, inhabitants of far-eastern Asia, now the Russian Far East, came to trade at Kotzebue. Furs, seal-oil, hides, rifles, ammunition, and seal skins were some of the items traded. People also gathered for competitions like the current World Eskimo Indian Olympics. With the arrival of the whalers, traders, gold seekers, and missionaries the trading center expanded.

Kotzebue is also known as Qikiqtaġruk, which means &quot;small island&quot; or &quot;resembles an island&quot; in the Iñupiaq language. In the words of the late Iñupiaq elder Blanche Qapuk Lincoln of Kotzebue:
Kotzebue gets its name from the Kotzebue Sound, which was named after Otto von Kotzebue, a Baltic German who explored the sound while searching for the Northwest Passage in the service of Russia in 1818.

===19th century===
A United States post office was established in 1899.

===20th century===
In 1958, Kotzebue Air Force Station was completed. The radar site would be operated by on-site personnel until its deactivation in 1983 and the subsequent demolition of most of the station&#x27;s structures. The radome continues to operate, but is now mostly unattended.

In 1990, the German drama film &quot;Salmonberries&quot; starring k.d. lang was mostly shot in Kotzebue.

In 1997, three 66-kw wind turbines were installed in Kotzebue, creating the northernmost wind farm in the United States. Today, the wind farm consists of 19 turbines, including two 900 kW EWT turbines. The total installed capacity has reached 3-MW, displacing approximately 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel every year.

===21st century===

On September 2, 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama gave a speech on global warming in Kotzebue, becoming the first sitting president to visit a site north of the Arctic Circle.

Since 2016, the United States Coast Guard has deployed MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters to Kotzebue from the beginning of July to the end of October as part of Operation Arctic Shield.

In 2017, the city received an All-America City award from the National Civic League.

On December 3, 2018, Mike Dunleavy was sworn in as the 12th governor of Alaska in Kotzebue&#x27;s high school gymnasium after inclement weather thwarted his plan to hold the ceremony in Noorvik.

In November 2023, ProPublica and &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; released an investigative report of domestic abuse and potential murders in Kotzebue involving six indigenous women who had dated Mayor Clement Richards Sr&#x27;s three sons, resulting in a total of 16 charges that were ultimately dismissed by local prosecutors or received minimum sentences by local judicial magistrates. While a state medical examiner stated for one of the women that there were &quot;signs of strangulation&quot;, the local police eventually closed the case as suicide. In January 2024, the police released a statement saying they would not be re-opening the case, with their timeline of events in the statement contradicting events that occurred just after the woman&#x27;s death. The city police said the other case of strangulation on the Mayor&#x27;s property was referred to state investigators, though the Alaska Department of Public Safety said no such case was ever given to them.

==Toxins==
Although no &quot;toxic releases&quot; come from within the bounds of Kotzebue, the methods used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&#x27;s in their Toxic Releases Inventory (TRI) reports that in 2016, Kotzebue, with only 7,500 inhabitants, &quot;produced&quot; 756 million pounds of toxins.(Due to the way the EPA defines toxins, even the discharge of filtered and pH balanced water is called a toxin.) The TRI placed Kotzebue as the most toxic place in the United States. The second most toxic was Bingham Canyon, Utah at 200 million pounds of toxins. However, as &quot;National Geographic&quot; explains, the source of the toxins is not Kotzebue, but Alaska&#x27;s Red Dog mine. Since the mine is located in a remote area in Alaska, the toxic release is linked to the nearest &quot;city&quot;— Kotzebue. The EPA says that when a &quot;facility&quot; is &quot;not located in a city, town, village, or similar entity will often list a nearby city.&quot; &quot;National Geographic&quot; says that, &quot;All 756 million pounds of toxic chemicals attributed to &quot;Kotzebue&quot; on the TRI dataset came from one of the world&#x27;s largest zinc and lead mines, the Red Dog mine, which is located about 80 miles north of Kotzebue.&quot; At the county level the Northwest Arctic of Alaska leads the list with 756,000,000 pounds of toxins. The state of Alaska produces three times more toxins than every other American state—834 million pounds.

<text>Red Dog Mine is a census-designated place (CDP) in the Northwest Arctic Borough of the U.S. state of Alaska. The population was 5 at the 2020 census, down from 309 in 2010.

==Economy==
The Red Dog mine is the only economic activity and the mine is the only inhabited site within the Red Dog Mine CDP.

==Mining==
The Red Dog Mine CDP derives its name from the Red Dog mine, the United States&#x27; largest source for zinc and a significant source of lead and germanium. Construction of the Red Dog mine began in 1987, after exploration revealed that the area was rich in metals.

The Red Dog ore body is one of the world&#x27;s most significant zinc deposits, containing a number of ore bodies. The mine is located in Alaska&#x27;s Northwest Arctic Borough, in the DeLong Mountains of the western Brooks Range, 90 miles north of Kotzebue and 55 miles from the Chukchi Sea.

At the end of 2007, the site&#x27;s proven and probable reserves plus indicated resources amounted to 77.5 million tons, containing 17.5 percent zinc and 4.8 percent lead, as well as 2.8 ounces per ton of silver. In addition, Red Dog also contains 36.6 million tons of inferred resources. The entire deposit lies inside a relatively small area (one mile by one-half mile). The deposit is essentially flat-lying at the surface, making open pit mining the extraction method of choice.

==Geography==
Red Dog Mine is located at . It is in the DeLong Mountains in the remote western Brooks Range about north of Kotzebue and from the Chukchi Sea.

Red Dog Mine is very isolated. It is located within the Northwest Arctic Borough, an area approximately the size of Indiana with only 11 communities, none connected by roads, with a total population of only 7,523 people at the 2010 census. The nearest of those communities are Noatak, population 514, roughly south and Kivalina, population 374, roughly west at the 2010 census.

Although native populations have historically used the nearby area for seasonal food-gathering, there are no permanent residents at the mine or the port site. The mine&#x27;s workforce consists of about 460 employees and contractors, of which somewhat more than half will be on-site at any given time. At the mine, everyone stays in the single large housing unit, tucked in among the process buildings near the edge of the open pit, while a small portion of the work force stays at the port site.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
The climate type of Red Dog Mine belongs to the subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwc&quot;), which is mainly characterized by cold and long winters and warm and short summers. June and July are the warmest months of the year and the only months with average temperatures above . In midsummer, daytime temperatures average around , while in winter, nighttime temperatures average around . In summer, there are 13 days with highs of each year; in winter, there are 76 days with lows below . Temperature extremes ranged from on February 1, 2012, to on June 19, 2013.
==Demographics==

Red Dog Mine first appeared on the 2000 U.S. census as a census-designated place (CDP).

As of the census of 2000, there were 32 people, 0 households, and 0 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 0 housing units. The racial makeup of the CDP was 31.25% White, 65.62% Native American, and 3.12% from two or more races.

In the CDP, the age distribution of the population shows 18.8% from 18 to 24, 62.5% from 25 to 44, and 18.8% from 45 to 64. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 700.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 700.0 males.

The median income for both males and females in the CDP was $0. The per capita income for the CDP was $34,438. 37.9% of the population were living below the poverty line.

==Transportation==
A haul road connects the mine pit to its seaport on the Chukchi Sea. Concentrated lead and zinc powder are trucked year-round from the mine to a storage area near the port, but vessels are only able to reach the pier about 100 days a year when the area is ice-free.

The rest of the year, the area is only accessible only by air, served by the Red Dog Airport. Mine workers from remote villages in the region are ferried to the mine on small aircraft. Alaska Airlines is contracted by the mine to fly other mine workers out of Anchorage.

<text>Shungnak ( or ) is a city in Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 262, up from 256 in 2000.

==History==
Shungnak originally was settled in 1899, approximately 10 miles to the east along the Kobuk River. The name &quot;Shungnak&quot; is derived from Iñupiaq term &quot;Isiŋnaq&quot; which means jade, a stone found in the surrounding area. In the 1920s, erosion along the river caused many residents to abandon the old townsite. In 1927, they resettled at a site originally known as &quot;Kochuk.&quot; Residents decided to rename Kochuk as the new Shungnak. At the old Shungnak village, some residents chose to remain. To avoid confusion between the two villages, Old Shungnak became Kobuk in 1928.

Shungnak officially incorporated in 1967.

==Geography==
Shungnak is located at 

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and of it (13.10%) is water.

The town is located about 150 miles east of Kotzebue.

==Demographics==

The present Shungnak first appeared on the 1930 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. The Shungnak listed on the 1910 and 1920 censuses was for the Old Shungnak, which became Kobuk in 1928. This Shungnak has reported on every census since 1930. It was formally incorporated as a city in 1967.

As of the census of 2000, there were 256 people, 56 households, and 51 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 64 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 5.47% White and 94.53% Alaska Native.

Of those 56 households, 66.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.6% were married couples living together, 16.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 8.9% were non-families. In addition, 7.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 1.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.57 and the average family size was 4.53.

In the city, the age distribution of the population shows 48.4% under the age of 18; 8.6% from 18 to 24; 23.8% from 25 to 44; 12.9% from 45 to 64; and 6.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 19 years. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.1 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $44,375, and the median income for a family was $41,000. Males had a median income of $25,750 versus $33,750 for females. The per capita income for the city was $10,377. About 21.7% of families and 35.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 46.2% of those under the age of eighteen and none of those 65 or over.

==Economics==
Shungnak has a “mixed economy” in which market, subsistence, and public sectors all contribute to individual well-being. The most comprehensive community economy data come from household surveys by the Division of Subsistence in the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G). The Division administered a comprehensive socio-economic survey to 46 of 69 Shungnak households (66.7%) in 2013. For the calendar year 2012, ADF&amp;G estimated a total community income of $4.1 million, with a median household income of $50,091. Estimated per capita income in 2012 was $15,009. Earned income contributed an estimated 71% of the total, including income from local government (26.7%), services (22.0%), and mining (11.3%). Other (unearned) income contributed an estimated 28.7% of the total, including Native corporation dividends (6.7%), food stamps (5.6%), and the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (4.9%). For comparison, in 2021 the American Community Survey estimated the five-year median household income in Shungnak to be $60,938 (±$8,736).

For calendar year 2012, the ADF&amp;G survey estimated that Shungnak residents harvested 100,872 lb (±30%) of wild food, or about 368 lb per person. The top five wild foods by estimated edible weight were caribou (53,802 lb, 53% of the total), sheefish (17,334 lb, 17%), chum salmon (14,747 lb, 15%), broad whitefish (2,842 lb, 3%), and moose (2,421 lb, 2%). All of surveyed households reported harvesting at least one kind of wild food for personal or family consumption. On average, households reported harvesting 7 and using 13 kinds of wildlife foods (the most reported by a single household was 27 kinds of wild food).

The ADF&amp;G survey included questions intended to assess households’ food security. During the 2012 study year, an estimated 86% of Shungnak Households were identified as being food secure. Of the remaining households, 7% exhibited low food security, and 7% had very low food security. The percentage of food-secure households in Shungnak was about the same as in the United States overall, and slightly lower than in the State of Alaska overall (88%). However, the percentage of households in Shungnak reporting “very low” food security was higher in Shungnak (7%) than in the nation (6%) or in the State of Alaska (4%).

The Division of Subsistence administered a similar comprehensive survey in Shungnak in 2003.

==Facilities==
The Shungnak School, operated by the Northwest Arctic Borough School District, serves the community. it had 7 teachers and 86 students, with Alaska Natives making up 95% of the student body.

The source of municipal water is from a reservoir intermittently filled from the Kobuk River. Previously, there was a water infiltration gallery that was destroyed by ice. Groundwater wells have proven unsuccessful.

The town has a 4,001-ft gravel runway owned by the state of Alaska. In the summer of 2006, only part of a fuel shipment was able to be delivered by barge and the remainder of the town&#x27;s fuel needs had to be supplied by air. This resulted in the price of gasoline rising to $8.10 per gallon at the town&#x27;s only filling station in 2006–07.

A hybrid solar-plus-storage microgrid, funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Northwest Arctic Borough, supplements diesel power generation. The hybrid solar-plus-storage microgrid utilizes 384 kWh total capacity of energy storage solution and 225 kW solar array.

<doc id="105601" wikidata="Q3002001" url="?curid=105601" title="Craig, Alaska">
<text>Craig () is a city in the Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area in the Unorganized Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. The population was 1,036 at the 2020 census, down from 1,201 in 2010.

==Geography==
Craig is the largest town on Prince of Wales Island, the fourth-largest island in the United States. Craig is approximately by air northwest of Ketchikan and south of Juneau.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (28.94%) is water.

==Climate==
Craig has an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb). Summers are mild with cool nights, while winters are chilly and wet. Precipitation is abundant year-round but is heaviest in autumn.

==History==
Originally, Craig&#x27;s townsite was a temporary fishing camp used for gathering herring.

===Name===
Craig was named after Craig Miller (also spelled Millar) who established a fish saltery on nearby Fish Egg Island in 1907 with the assistance of the local Haida natives who moved onto Prince of Wales Island, being driven from Haida Gwaii (British Columbia&#x27;s Queen Charlotte Islands) starting in the 18th century. Craig Miller constructed a cold storage plant and packing company at the present site of Craig, and in 1922 was instrumental in the incorporation of the city (originally as an Alaska second-class city within the Alaska Territory, pre-statehood).

===Growth===
The commercial fishing industry was responsible for Craig&#x27;s relatively large population compared to neighboring communities. In the 1930s, record pink salmon runs brought many new settlers. The 1950s saw a collapse of the fishing industry because of depleted salmon populations. In 1972, a large sawmill was established nearby providing a steady source of year-round employment. Today, Craig relies on commercial fishing, fish processing, and the timber industry.

===1982 Murders===
On September 7, 1982, the fishing boat &quot;Investor&quot; was found burning off the coast of Craig, and the boat&#x27;s passengers and crew were found to have been killed. Due to the badly burned state of the bodies, investigators were only certain that they had recovered the remains of seven bodies, but a coroner&#x27;s jury ruled that all eight who were aboard the boat had been killed. The boat&#x27;s owner, Mark Coulthurst, from Blaine, Washington, his wife Irene, and their two young children were among the victims. In September 1984, a suspect, John Kenneth Peel, from Bellingham, Washington, was arrested for the murders. Peel&#x27;s first trial ended in a hung jury, and his retrial, in 1988, ended in his acquittal. In 2017, Tim DeSpain, spokesman for the Alaska State Troopers stated that &quot;the case is closed&quot;

===2013 earthquake===

On January 5, 2013, at 3:58 am ET Craig was hit by a 7.5-magnitude offshore earthquake 63 miles (102 km) west of the town. Regional tsunami warnings and advisories were issued. Voluntary evacuations of the town occurred. Despite this, no fatalities, serious injuries, or incidents of damage were reported and the tsunami threat never materialized other than minor, localized sea level rises.

==Demographics==

Craig first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It incorporated in 1922.

==Transportation==
Craig, the island&#x27;s largest population center and administrative hub for many island companies and organizations, actually has limited-direct transportation off Prince of Wales Island.

===Seaplane base===
Transportation is primarily via floatplane charters at Craig Seaplane Base. Klawock Airport can accommodate wheeled-aircraft and is a short drive away.

===Ferry===
Inter-Island Ferry Authority provides regularly scheduled year-round ferry service between Ketchikan and Hollis located on the Eastern coast of Prince of Wales island. The Inter-Island Ferry Authority&#x27;s central offices are located in Klawock. The ferry terminal is located an hour drive outside of Craig and the ferry takes 3 hours to get to Ketchikan, Alaska.

There are a few marine shipping companies providing scheduled cargo barge service to South-Eastern, Alaska. Craig is usually one of their ports-of-call, handling inter-modal shipping containers for deliveries to other communities.

===Shuttle===
Prince of Wales Transportation based in Craig, provides island-wide shuttle services from the ferry terminals to the other communities and island attractions.

==Economy==
Commercial fishing and related support business comprises the largest portion of Craig&#x27;s economy. This is supplemented by timber industry related activities like the sawmill, and many residents use subsistence resources in addition to the formal economy.

In 2000, Craig had 42 vessel owners with operations in federal fisheries, 84 vessel owners with operations in state fisheries, and 149 registered crew members; 199 residents held 437 commercial fishing permits; 3,405 sport fishing licenses were sold, 2,590 licenses to non-residents of Alaska.

Commercial fishing generates much of the income in Craig. There are two harbors in the center of town one which primarily contains smaller charter and recreational boats, and the North Cove Harbor where the trollers, seiners, longliners, shrimp, crab, and dive boats that make up the local fleet are moored. During the peak of the fishing season in summer, the harbor is usually so full that boats must anchor out in the bay.

Tourism provides jobs and income to the community. Many charter fishing lodges cater to guests who visit the island for the salmon fishing as well as black bear and deer hunting.

The other main employer in Craig is the U.S. Forest Service. The rest of the economy is mainly supportive. There is a city-run medical clinic, a few restaurants, a general store, two banks, a grocery store, a coffeeshop/bookstore, clothing store, gift store, nursery and outdoor outfitter.

===Schools===
Craig has an elementary, middle, high school and an alternative school with 35 teachers and about 300 students.

===Utilities===
City of Craig provides piped water from the North Fork Lake reservoir, as well as providing a public sewage system.

Alaska Power &amp; Telephone (an employee owned company) provides hydro-electric power, telephone, and internet service to much of southeastern Alaska, including Craig. There are a few cellular carriers providing service on Prince of Wales Island, mostly to the more densely populated communities like Craig.

<text>Hydaburg ( ) (&quot;Higdáa G̱ándlaay&quot; in Haida) is a first-class city in the Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, in the U.S. state of Alaska. The population was 382 at the 2000 census and 376 as of the 2010 census. The name &quot;Hydaburg&quot; refers to the Haida people.

==History==
Hydaburg was formed in 1911 by consolidation of the three Haida villages on Cordova Bay. These villages were Howkan on the west coast of Long Island, Sukkwan at the northern end of Sukkwan Island, across Sukkwan Strait from Hydaburg, and Klinkwan on Prince of Wales Island at the mouth of Hunter Bay. The location was chosen because it had a reliable water supply. The town was incorporated in 1927. The Hydaburg Cooperative Association was established in 1938 shortly after the Indian Reorganization Act was extended to Alaska in 1936, supplanting the municipal government. It was the first IRA-recognized Village Council in Alaska. Residents petitioned to be granted an Indian Reservation as a way of securing their rights to the surrounding land. The area had previously been designated as the Hydaburg Indian Reservation from 1912-1926 but had been returned to the Tongass National Forest at community request in 1926. The Hydaburg Indian Reservation was established under the Indian Reorganization Act in 1949 but was invalidated by a US District Court decision in 1952.

Hydaburg was designated as a second-class City in the late 1960s and became a first-class city in 1973. The Hydaburg Cooperative Association remains as the federally recognized tribe, while the Haida Corporation is the village corporation under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.

<text>Hyder is a census-designated place in Prince of Wales–Hyder Census Area, Alaska, United States. The population was 48 at the 2020 census, down from 87 in 2010. Hyder is accessible by road only from Stewart, British Columbia. It is popular with motorists wishing to visit Alaska without driving the length of the Alaska Highway. Hyder has no direct access to any Alaskan road. It is the southernmost community in the state that can be reached via car (others can be reached only by boat or plane). Hyder is Alaska&#x27;s easternmost community.

== Geography ==

Hyder is located at (55.941442, -130.054504), at the end of the land border between Alaska and British Columbia and at the head of the Portland Canal, a long fjord which forms a portion of the border at the southeastern edge of the Alaska Panhandle. It sits about from Stewart, British Columbia, by road, and from Ketchikan by air.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the census-designated place (CDP) has a total area of , all land.

==Climate==
Hyder has a fairly typical Southeastern Alaskan oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;, borderline &quot;Dfb&quot;), although using the coldest-month isotherm it has an extremely wet and ocean-moderated version of a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) similar to that of Haines although substantially wetter.
== Demographics ==

Hyder first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It was chosen as the central part of its same-named census-designated place (CDP) in 1980.

As of the census of 2000, there were 97 people, 47 households, and 25 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 72 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 93 White, and 4 from two or more races. There was 1 Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 47 households, out of which 9 had children under the age of 18 living with them, 24 were married couples living together, 1 had a female householder with no husband present, and 21 were non-families. 19 of all households were made up of individuals, and 3 had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.06 and the average family size was 2.81.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 18 under 18, 11 from 18 to 24, 16 from 25 to 44, 45 from 45 to 64, and 7 who were 65 or older. The median age was 46 years. There were 44 females and 53 males, of them 34 females were age 18 and over, as were 45 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $11,719, and the median income for a family was $30,500. Males had a median income of $56,250 versus $13,750 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $11,491. There were 44.4% of families and 54.1% of the population living below the poverty line, including 81.0% under 18, and 50.0% over 64.

== Transportation ==
Stewart, British Columbia, immediately borders Hyder and is accessible by road via International Street. Outside of the town site, NFD-88 heads in a northerly direction winding through the Tongass National Forest, and enters the outer extent of Stewart&#x27;s municipal limits continuing as Granduc Road. There are few local roads, and no roads connect Hyder to any other Alaskan communities, except through Canada. The AMHS ferry that once connected Hyder to Ketchikan stopped running in the 1990s, leaving the Taquan Air floatplane that arrives twice a week with U.S. Mail at Hyder Seaplane Base as the only direct public transportation between Hyder and the rest of Alaska.

== Local services ==

There are few local services in town:
* US Postal Service
* US Forest Service Info Kiosk and observation site
* Hyder Community Association, home to a museum, information center and library

== Public utilities ==

Hyder&#x27;s public utilities are imported from Canada. Electricity is maintained by a subsidiary of BC Hydro, the Tongass Power and Light Company as part of a long-term contract with the town. While most of Alaska is in area code 907, Hyder shares the Stewart 749 exchange in area code 236, 636 in area code 250, and 794 in area code 778.

== Public safety ==

Alaska State Troopers occasionally patrol the town, but do not have a base there. In 1996, a fire consumed the community building which contained the library, post office and fire hall.

The Hyder Volunteer Fire Department was originally formed in 1921. The department was reestablished and registered with the Alaska Department of Public Safety in 2023 after a 25 year absence. There is currently no emergency medical services established yet in Hyder.

A Canada Border Services Agency customs post is on the only connecting road out of Hyder and there is no complementary American border patrol presence.

== History ==

The Nisga&#x27;a, who lived around the Nass River, called the head of Portland Canal &quot;Skam-A-Kounst,&quot; meaning &quot;safe place&quot;, probably because it served them as a retreat from the harassment of the Haidas on the coast. They traveled in the area seasonally to pick berries.

The area around the Portland Canal was explored in 1896 by Captain D.D. Gaillard of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

In 1898, gold and silver lodes were discovered in the region, mainly on the Canadian side, in the upper Salmon River basin. The Stewart brothers, for whom the British Columbia town was named, arrived in 1902.

Hyder was established in 1907 as &quot;Portland City&quot;, after the canal. In 1914, when the US Post Office Department told residents that there were many U.S. communities named Portland, it was renamed &quot;Hyder&quot;, after Frederick Hyder, a Canadian mining engineer who envisioned a bright future for the area. Hyder was the only practical point of access to the silver mines in Canada; the community became the port, supply point, and post office for miners by 1917. Hyder&#x27;s boom years were the 1920s, when the Riverside Mine on the U.S. side extracted gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, and tungsten. The mine operated from 1924 to 1950.

In 1928, the Hyder business district was consumed by fire. By 1956 all significant mining had ceased, except for the Granduc Mine on the Canadian side, which operated until 1984 and 2010 to present. Westmin Resources Ltd operated a gold and silver mine on the Canadian side in Premier, British Columbia, but is not currently active.

== Culture ==

Hyder is accessible by highway from Stewart, which connects with the British Columbia highway system. In the mid-2010s, Hyder residents said that more than 100,000 tourists came to Hyder annually. It is the location of the annual Hyder Seek gathering of long-distance motorcyclists who travel from all over North America each Memorial Day weekend. It became popular with long-distance motorcycle riders in 1998, when author Ron Ayres set a record of riding to the contiguous 48 states in six days. Ayres went on to add to the 48-state record by continuing on to Hyder to establish a new 49-state record of 7 days, 0 hours and 20 minutes. Ayres named the new long distance ride the &quot;48 Plus&quot; and it has become popular with members of the long-distance motorcycle riding Iron Butt Association. Hyder was the starting point of the 2014 coast-to-coast Scooter Cannonball Run, which ended in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Because of its accessible proximity to Stewart, and its isolation from other communities in Alaska, Hyder has many commonalities with its Canadian neighbor, with both American and Canadian holidays observed, and a shared international Chamber of Commerce. It is the only place in Alaska not to use the 907 area code, instead using British Columbia&#x27;s 250. Although Hyder is officially in the Alaska Time Zone, residents set their clocks to British Columbia&#x27;s Pacific Time. Both American and Canadian currency are accepted, except by the U.S. Post Office, which only accepts U.S. dollars.

A local tradition is known as being &quot;Hyderized&quot;, with two of the town&#x27;s bars issuing certificates to patrons who consume a shot of 151 proof (75.5% alcohol) Everclear.

==Education==
Southeast Island School District operates the Hyder School.

Children who live in Hyder have attended the Bear Valley School in Stewart, but Hyder has school when the community meets the Alaska minimum of 10 children for the state to provide a teacher.

== Trivia ==
At the border crossing to Stewart, there is a humorous imitation of a sign at the historic Berlin border crossing Checkpoint Charlie with the inscription &quot;You are leaving the American Sector&quot; in English, French, and German, as well as a sign reading &quot;Eastern Sektor&quot;. The sign was erected in 2015 as a protest after the Canadian administration announced plans to close the border control at night.
Hyder uses the area codes of Stewart, British Columbia.

<doc id="105606" wikidata="Q79528" url="?curid=105606" title="Kasaan, Alaska">
<text>Kasaan (; ) is a city in the Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. The population was 49 at the 2010 census, up from 39 in 2000. The name &quot;Kasaan&quot; comes from Tlingit , meaning &quot;pretty town&quot;.

==History==
Kasaan is one of the main historical communities of the Kaigani Haida. It is the most northernly Haida settlement. It was established by the Haida in protohistoric times or earlier, as part of a migration across the Dixon Entrance, from Dadens and other villages of Langara Island, Haida Gwaii, to Dall Island and Prince of Wales Island.

Beginning in the late 1700s, European and American ships began regularly visiting and trading with Kasaan and the rest of the Haida. Most early visiting ships were part of the maritime fur trade. The nearby trading site, &quot;Kaigani&quot;, was one of the most popular on the Pacific Northwest coast. This trade brought wealth, but also disease; the first smallpox epidemic hit Kasaan in 1794. A rough census was taken of Kasaan between 1836 and 1841 by John Work of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He reported 249 people living in the village. The 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic killed over 70% of all Haida people. The first official census was taken in 1880, and lists only 173 at Kasaan. In the 1880s and 1890s, Alaska Steamship Company boats regularly visited a nearby fish saltery and packing business, and sometimes Kasaan. Tourists visiting Kasaan helped spark trade in Haida artifacts and new artwork.

Residents moved from their former village on Skowl Arm (now called Old Kasaan), starting in 1893, and mostly in the period 1902–1904. In 1901, the leaders of Kasaan were persuaded by the Kasaan Bay Mining Company to relocate the entire village to a new site closer to the copper mine. This migration was prompted by the promise of jobs and a school occasioned by development of copper mining and a cannery near the present location. Kasaan was established as a city in 1976.

Old Kasaan was completely abandoned by 1904, and the remains were partly destroyed by fire in 1915. The site was declared a national monument in 1916, though Old Kasaan National Monument was largely neglected and a planned restoration was not done. In 1938 five historic and three replica totem poles were moved to New Kasaan. In 1955, the site was removed from the National Park System. It became Forest Service jurisdiction, which established a 38-acre Old Kasaan Village Historical Area in 1957. The relocated totem poles and a relocated house in New Kasaan were designated the Chief Son-I-Hat&#x27;s Whale House and Totems Historic District in 2002.

==Geography==
Kasaan is located at (55.541748, -132.401821).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (14.58%) is water.

Kasaan means &quot;pretty town&quot; in the Tlingit language.

==Demographics==

Kasaan first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as an unincorporated native village. It formally incorporated in 1976.

As of the 2000 census, there were 39 people, 17 households, and 12 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 39 housing units at an average density of .

There were 17 households, out of which 3 had children under the age of 18 living with them, 11 were married couples living together, 1 had a female householder with no husband present, and 5 were non-families. 4 households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.29 and the average family size was 2.75.

In the city, the age distribution of the population shows 8 residents under the age of 18, 3 from 18 to 24, 9 from 25 to 44, 15 from 45 to 64, and 4 who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45 years. There were 22 male residents and 17 female, with 18 and 13 over the age of 18, giving a ratio of 129.4 males per 100 females and 138.5 males per 100 females age 18 and over.

The median income for a household was $43,500, and the median income for a family was $42,500. Males had a median income of $36,250 versus $0 for females. The per capita income was $19,743. No residents were living below the poverty line.

<text>Klawock () is a city in Prince of Wales–Hyder Census Area, in the U.S. state of Alaska, on the west coast of Prince of Wales Island, on Klawock Inlet, across from Klawock Island. The population was 755 at the 2010 census, down from 854 in 2000. It is located from Ketchikan, from Craig, and from Hollis.

==History==
Klawock&#x27;s first settlers were Tlingit who came from the northern winter village of Tuxekan. They used it as a fishing camp for the summer period, and called it by several different names: Klawerak, Tlevak, Clevak, and Klawak. The name &quot;Klawock&quot; is derived from the Tlingit name , the man who founded the community. In 1853 a Russian navigator referred to the village as &quot;Klyakkhan&quot;, and in 1855 as &quot;Thlewakh&quot;.

In 1868, European Americans opened a trading post and a salmon saltery; some years later, in 1878, a San Francisco firm opened the first cannery in Alaska. In the following decades, several others were established. A United States post office was established in 1882. The 1890 census recorded the town&#x27;s population as 260.

The Alaska Native Brotherhood (ANB) and Alaska Native Sisterhood (ANS), nonprofit organizations working for civil rights of Alaska Natives, were established by residents in 1912. Its founders and many volunteers built the Town Hall and a community center in 1939, during the Great Depression.

In 1929 the town was incorporated as a city, and in 1934 Congress awarded federal funding for the expansion of the cannery, on the condition that the community remains liquor-free. At the same time, the Klawock Cooperative Association (a nonprofit organization) was formed to manage the cannery.

In 1931 John Barrymore looted a Totem pole from the abandoned village of Tuxekan; in 2015 the pole was returned to the Tlingit.

<text>Metlakatla (; Tsimshian: &quot;Maxłaxaała&quot; or &quot;Tak&#x27;waan&quot;; Lingít: &quot;Tàakw.àani&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) on Annette Island in Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 1,405; this had grown to 1,454 by the 2020 census.

Since the late 19th century, it has been the major settlement of the Metlakatla Indian Community of the federally recognized Annette Island Reserve, the only remaining reserve in Alaska. The Metlakatla voted to opt out of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of the 1970s and retained rights to their land and waters. Membership in the community is primarily by lineage; it consists primarily of Tsimshian people and also includes those from other Alaskan Native tribes who wish to join the Metlakatla Indian Community as a bona fide member. Bona fide membership is granted upon approval of the Metlakatla Tribal Council and Executives.

== History ==

&quot;Metlakatla&quot; comes from &quot;Maxłaxaała&quot;, a Tsimshian word meaning &quot;saltwater passage where the wind dies down.&quot; Metlakatla was named after another village of the same name (&quot;Old Metlakatla&quot;) in British Columbia, which is on Metlakatla Pass, near Prince Rupert. In a more ancient time, it was a Tlingit hunting ground known as &quot;Taquan,&quot; or &quot;Tàakw.àani.&quot; The Tsimshian were granted permission to occupy the land by Chief Johnson of the Tlingit tribe.

In 1886, William Duncan, an English tannery employee and lay member of the Church Missionary Society, had a doctrinal dispute with the Church authorities in Metlakatla, B.C. He and a devoted group of Tsimshian followers decided to leave Metlakatla. Duncan went to Washington, D.C., in the United States and asked the U.S. government to give his group land in Alaska. The U.S. under President Cleveland gave them Annette Island after a Tsimshian search committee in seagoing canoes discovered its calm bay, accessible beaches, nearby waterfall, and abundant fish.
In 1887, the group arrived on the island and built a settlement in the Port Chester area. They laid out the town in a European-style grid pattern. It contained a church, a school, a cannery, and a sawmill. They named the town New Metlakatla, after the town they had left behind, but later dropped the &quot;New.&quot; In 1888, William Duncan returned to Washington and lobbied the U.S. Congress for an Indian reserve on Annette Island. Although the reservation system had not been used in Alaska, Congress granted his request in 1891. Duncan remained at Metlakatla until his death in 1918.
During World War II, the United States made a treaty with the Metlakatla Indian Community to permit construction and operation of a military airbase on Annette Island. In exchange, the US promised to build a road connecting the ocean-side city to Alaska&#x27;s Inside Passage (in order to allow year-round ferry service to Ketchikan). The airfield on Annette Island was garrisoned by Canadians during the war. This airfield became &quot;the first Canadian force ever based in U.S. territory to directly assist in American defense.&quot;

After the war, the property was adapted as a United States Coast Guard search and rescue base. This airfield served the area commercially until the 1970s, when the new Ketchikan Airport was built at Gravina Island in the Inside Passage.

Annette Islands Reserve, including surrounding islands, today is the only Indian Reserve in Alaska. In the 1970s, the Metlakatla did not accept the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and thus kept the Reserve Status, and maintained sovereign immunity. &quot;Annette Islands Reserve consists of 132,000 acres of land and water base. Metlakatla Indian Community has exclusive commercial and subsistence fishing rights to the islands’ waterways extending from 3,000 feet at mean low tide.&quot;
Please note that the Annette island&#x27;s Reserve is not a reservation. It is a reserve

Travelers into Metlakatla usually reach it via the Alaska Marine Highway ferry. They can also travel to Ketchikan on Revillagigedo Island and cross the Revillagigedo Channel to Annette Island by boat or seaplane.

More than 50 years after the end of WWII, in 1997 the US Federal Government began construction of the cross-island road promised to Metlakatla under its wartime M.O.A. treaty. From 1997 to 2007, a joint task force under the overall command of Alaska Command, and led by the Missouri Army National Guard, worked at constructing a 15-mile road from one side of Annette Island to the other. Members of the Active and Reserve components of the Army, Navy, United States Air Force, and the Marines deployed to the island on 2- to 3-week rotations to build the road.

==Geography and climate==

Metlakatla has a Marine west coast climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), with windy and wet weather year-round, cool winters, and mild summers, and straddles the border between USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 7 and 8. Due to its southerly and maritime location, with an annual mean temperature of , the town is one of the warmest locations statewide. Most days during the winter see precipitation fall, and the seasonal total snowfall of occurs mostly from November to March, with some accumulation during April; warm spells raise the high to for several days each month.

Precipitation averages more than annually, with June and July being the driest months and October and November the wettest. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on January 30, 1947, up to on June 19, 2004, with the temperature having fallen below only on a handful of occasions. In addition, the Annette Island Airport holds the Alaska state monthly record high temperatures for April ( on April 29, 1976) and November ( on November 1, 1970).

==History==
In 1975, Point Baker and Port Protection made national news when Zieske v Butz, a landmark lawsuit against the US Forest Service brought by Pnt Baker residents Charles Zieske, Alan Stein, and Herb Zieske, was decided by Judge James von der Heydt, the Alaska Federal District court judge. The lawsuit was initiated by Alan Stein and the Point Baker Association which had about 30 fishermen members from the communities of Pt baker and Port Protection. On December 24, 1975, von der Hedyt issued an injunction against all clearcutting on the North end of the Prince of Wales island from Red Bay to Calder Bay. The lawsuit stopped planned clear cutting on on the north end Island. Congress lifted the injunction when it passed the National Forest Management Act in 1976.

Twice more Pt Baker an Port Protection made headlines in 1989, in a landmark lawsuit called Stein v Barton, many of its residents fought for buffer strips on all the salmon streams of the Tongass and for protection of the Salmon Bay watershed. In the 1990 Tongass Timber Reform Act, lobbyists for an environmental group in Washington compromised with Senator Ted Stevens and only got part of the Salmon Bay watershed protected. The timber surrounding an important salmon stream was bargained away. This statute also protected all the salmon streams in the Tongass with buffer strips during logging operations.

In February 2010, Senators Murkowski and Begich are pushing Senate Bill 881 through Congress. The bill has gone through extensive community meetings and subsequently the bill has changed and controversial areas, such as north Prince of Wales, have been removed from the draft bill. The draft bill privatizes significant acreage of National Forest Land by conveying it into the exclusive ownership of SEALASKA, a native Alaskan corporation.

In 2011, having failed to pass S 881 and almost lost her seat as a result to Joe Miller in the election, Murkowski introduced S 730. Nine Alaskan towns have opposed the bill so far. Sealaska would get the largest volume class timber remaining which is vital to protecting wolves and goshawks, both of which could be listed as endangered.

Recently a recall petition has been launched from Pt Baker&#x27;s sister community, Edna Bay

== Namesake ==
Thorne Bay is named for Frank Manly Thorn (1836–1907), who served as the sixth Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1885 to 1889. The name of the bay was misspelled when published in the original record, and the spelling was never corrected to match the spelling of Thorn&#x27;s last name.

== History and culture ==
Thorne Bay originally began as a large logging camp for the Ketchikan Pulp Company in 1960 that was originally located in Hollis. Being a floating camp at the time, most Hollis residents resided in float houses. In the 1960s and 1970s it was the largest logging camp in North America and was host to over 1500 residents at its peak. It became a second-class city in 1982 and in 2001 the logging company pulled out having been a victim of breach of contract from the U.S. Forest Service. The U.S. Forest Service signed a fifty-year contract in 1954 guaranteeing per year for the pulp mill and sawmills in Ketchikan. By 1990 that figure was down to approximately per year. Currently Thorne Bay features many seasonal residents and an employment sector based primarily in Forest Service and public education.

== World&#x27;s largest logging camp ==
In the 1960s–1970s, Thorne Bay was the world&#x27;s largest logging camp. Thorne Bay also has the world&#x27;s largest tree grapple, which is known as &quot;the claw&quot;. The grapple sits in front of the small town with a sign that says &quot;Thorne Bay&quot;.

== Education ==
The school is the Thorne Bay School, operated by Southeast Island School District.

Admiralty Island has long been the home of the Kootznoowoo Tlingit group, or &quot;Xootsnoowú Ḵwáan&quot; in Tlingit. Kootznoowoo means &quot;fortress of brown bears&quot;, literally &quot;xoots-noow-ú&quot; &quot;brown.bear-fortress-possessive&quot;. Angoon has a less-rainy climate than most of southeastern Alaska and was valued by the Tlingit for that reason.

During the Russian period in Alaska, from the 18th century to the mid-19th century, maritime fur trading was a major economic activity in the area.

In 1878, after the 1867 Alaska Purchase, the North West Trading Company established a trading post and whaling station on nearby Killisnoo Island and employed Angoon villagers to hunt whales. Whaling, a school, and a Russian Orthodox church attracted many Tlingits to neighboring Killisnoo.

In October 1882, the village was destroyed in the Angoon Bombardment by US Naval forces under the command Commander Edgar C. Merriman and the &quot;USRC Thomas Corwin&quot; under the command of Michael A. Healy. The Tlingit villagers had taken white hostages and property and demanded two hundred blankets in compensation from the North West Trading Company following the accidental death of a Tlingit shaman who died in a whaling bomb accident while working on the whaler. The hostages were released upon the arrival of the naval expedition to Angoon, however Merriman demanded four hundred blankets in tribute and upon the Tlingit delivery of just eighty one blankets, Merriman&#x27;s forces destroyed the village.

After a short time, the North West Trading Company switched to herring processing. During this time, many Tlingits moved to Killisnoo for employment at the fish plant. In 1928, Killisnoo was destroyed by fire and many Tlingits returned to Angoon.

In 1973, Angoon won a U.S. $90,000 settlement from the United States government for the 1882 bombardment.

<doc id="105616" wikidata="Q498495" url="?curid=105616" title="Johnny Dodds">
<text>Johnny Dodds (; April 12, 1892 – August 8, 1940) was an American jazz clarinetist and alto saxophonist based in New Orleans, best known for his recordings under his own name and with bands such as those of Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Lovie Austin and Louis Armstrong. Dodds was the older brother of drummer Warren &quot;Baby&quot; Dodds, one of the first important jazz drummers. They worked together in the New Orleans Bootblacks in 1926. Dodds is an important figure in jazz history. He was the premier clarinetist of his era and, in recognition of his artistic contributions, he was posthumously inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame. He has been described as &quot;a prime architect in the creation of the Jazz Age.&quot;

==Biography==
Dodds was born in Waveland, Mississippi. His childhood environment was a musical one. His father and uncle were violinists, his sister played a melodeon, and in adolescence Johnny sang high tenor in the family quartet. According to legend, his instrumental skill began with a toy flute which had been purchased for his brother, Warren &quot;Baby&quot; Dodds. He was known for his serious and reserved manner as well as his &quot;funky blues playing,&quot; which earned him the nickname &quot;toilet.&quot;

He moved to New Orleans in his youth and studied the clarinet with Lorenzo Tio and Charlie McCurdy. He played with the bands of Frankie Duson, Kid Ory, and Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver. Dodds went to Chicago and played with Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band, with which he first recorded in 1923. Dodds blamed the breakup on not wanting to travel and on musical conflicts due to Oliver&#x27;s failing musical abilities. He also worked frequently with his good friend Natty Dominique during this period, a professional relationship that would last a lifetime. After the breakup of Oliver&#x27;s band in 1924, Dodds replaced Alcide Nunez as the house clarinetist and bandleader of Kelly&#x27;s Stables. From 1924 to 1930, Dodds worked regularly at Kelly&#x27;s Stables in Chicago. He recorded with numerous small groups in Chicago, including Louis Armstrong&#x27;s Hot Five and Hot Seven and Jelly Roll Morton&#x27;s Red Hot Peppers. He also recorded prolifically under his own name, Johnny Dodds&#x27; Black Bottom Stompers, between 1927 and 1929 for Paramount, Brunswick/Vocalion, and Victor. He became a big star on the Chicago jazz scene of the 1920s, but his career precipitously declined with the Great Depression. Although his career gradually recovered, he did not record for most of the 1930s, affected by ill-health; he recorded only two sessions—January 21, 1938, and June 5, 1940—both for Decca. On August 8, 1940, Dodds died of a stroke in his Chicago home and was buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Blue Island, Illinois.

Known for his professionalism and virtuosity as a musician and his heartfelt, heavily blues-laden style, Dodds was an important influence on later clarinetists, such as Benny Goodman, who stated that no one ever surpassed Dodds in achieving a finer tone with the clarinet. The tone was probably caused by the use of double embouchure (lower and upper lips over the mouthpiece) in combination with a very hard reed (a thin piece of cane resting against the mouthpiece) according to CDK Cook in the Syncophated Times May 10, 2020. Dodds was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame in 1987.

==Sibling rivalry==
Several accounts suggest the Dodds brothers did not always get along. When the brothers were young children, Johnny received a clarinet from his father while Baby did not get a drum even though he asked for one. In &quot;The Baby Dodds Story&quot;, Baby Dodds discusses his jealousy of his older brother when they were children. As they grew up, Johnny refused to let Baby play music with him because Baby was a heavy drinker and Johnny did not drink. When Joe Oliver hired Baby to join his band and Johnny realized how much Baby&#x27;s talent as a drummer had grown, Johnny changed his mind. Although they continued to argue about Baby&#x27;s excessive drinking, they grew closer as brothers and musicians. Baby was greatly affected by his brother&#x27;s death.

<doc id="105620" wikidata="Q333871" url="?curid=105620" title="Orthogonal matrix">
<text>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix, or orthonormal matrix, is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors.

One way to express this is
formula_1
where is the transpose of and is the identity matrix.

This leads to the equivalent characterization: a matrix is orthogonal if its transpose is equal to its inverse:
formula_2
where is the inverse of .

An orthogonal matrix is necessarily invertible (with inverse ), unitary (), where is the Hermitian adjoint (conjugate transpose) of , and therefore normal () over the real numbers. The determinant of any orthogonal matrix is either +1 or −1. As a linear transformation, an orthogonal matrix preserves the inner product of vectors, and therefore acts as an isometry of Euclidean space, such as a rotation, reflection or rotoreflection. In other words, it is a unitary transformation.

The set of orthogonal matrices, under multiplication, forms the group , known as the orthogonal group. The subgroup consisting of orthogonal matrices with determinant +1 is called the special orthogonal group, and each of its elements is a special orthogonal matrix. As a linear transformation, every special orthogonal matrix acts as a rotation.

==Overview==
An orthogonal matrix is the real specialization of a unitary matrix, and thus always a normal matrix. Although we consider only real matrices here, the definition can be used for matrices with entries from any field. However, orthogonal matrices arise naturally from dot products, and for matrices of complex numbers that leads instead to the unitary requirement. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so, for vectors and in an -dimensional real Euclidean space
formula_3
where is an orthogonal matrix. To see the inner product connection, consider a vector in an -dimensional real Euclidean space. Written with respect to an orthonormal basis, the squared length of is . If a linear transformation, in matrix form , preserves vector lengths, then
formula_4

Thus finite-dimensional linear isometries—rotations, reflections, and their combinations—produce orthogonal matrices. The converse is also true: orthogonal matrices imply orthogonal transformations. However, linear algebra includes orthogonal transformations between spaces which may be neither finite-dimensional nor of the same dimension, and these have no orthogonal matrix equivalent.

Orthogonal matrices are important for a number of reasons, both theoretical and practical. The orthogonal matrices form a group under matrix multiplication, the orthogonal group denoted by , which—with its subgroups—is widely used in mathematics and the physical sciences. For example, the point group of a molecule is a subgroup of O(3). Because floating point versions of orthogonal matrices have advantageous properties, they are key to many algorithms in numerical linear algebra, such as decomposition. As another example, with appropriate normalization the discrete cosine transform (used in MP3 compression) is represented by an orthogonal matrix.

==Examples==
Below are a few examples of small orthogonal matrices and possible interpretations.
*formula_5    (identity transformation)
*formula_6    (rotation about the origin)
*formula_7    (reflection across &quot;x&quot;-axis)
*formula_8    (permutation of coordinate axes)

==Elementary constructions==

===Lower dimensions===
The simplest orthogonal matrices are the matrices [1] and [−1], which we can interpret as the identity and a reflection of the real line across the origin.

The matrices have the form
formula_9
which orthogonality demands satisfy the three equations
formula_10

In consideration of the first equation, without loss of generality let , ; then either , or , . We can interpret the first case as a rotation by (where is the identity), and the second as a reflection across a line at an angle of .

formula_11

The special case of the reflection matrix with generates a reflection about the line at 45° given by and therefore exchanges and ; it is a permutation matrix, with a single 1 in each column and row (and otherwise 0):
formula_12

The identity is also a permutation matrix.

A reflection is its own inverse, which implies that a reflection matrix is symmetric (equal to its transpose) as well as orthogonal. The product of two rotation matrices is a rotation matrix, and the product of two reflection matrices is also a rotation matrix.

===Higher dimensions===
Regardless of the dimension, it is always possible to classify orthogonal matrices as purely rotational or not, but for matrices and larger the non-rotational matrices can be more complicated than reflections. For example,
formula_13

represent an &quot;inversion&quot; through the origin and a &quot;rotoinversion&quot;, respectively, about the -axis.

Rotations become more complicated in higher dimensions; they can no longer be completely characterized by one angle, and may affect more than one planar subspace. It is common to describe a rotation matrix in terms of an axis and angle, but this only works in three dimensions. Above three dimensions two or more angles are needed, each associated with a plane of rotation.

However, we have elementary building blocks for permutations, reflections, and rotations that apply in general.

===Primitives===
The most elementary permutation is a transposition, obtained from the identity matrix by exchanging two rows. Any permutation matrix can be constructed as a product of no more than transpositions.

A Householder reflection is constructed from a non-null vector as
formula_14

Here the numerator is a symmetric matrix while the denominator is a number, the squared magnitude of . This is a reflection in the hyperplane perpendicular to (negating any vector component parallel to ). If is a unit vector, then suffices. A Householder reflection is typically used to simultaneously zero the lower part of a column. Any orthogonal matrix of size can be constructed as a product of at most such reflections.

A Givens rotation acts on a two-dimensional (planar) subspace spanned by two coordinate axes, rotating by a chosen angle. It is typically used to zero a single subdiagonal entry. Any rotation matrix of size can be constructed as a product of at most such rotations. In the case of matrices, three such rotations suffice; and by fixing the sequence we can thus describe all rotation matrices (though not uniquely) in terms of the three angles used, often called Euler angles.

A Jacobi rotation has the same form as a Givens rotation, but is used to zero both off-diagonal entries of a symmetric submatrix.

==Properties==

===Matrix properties===
A real square matrix is orthogonal if and only if its columns form an orthonormal basis of the Euclidean space with the ordinary Euclidean dot product, which is the case if and only if its rows form an orthonormal basis of . It might be tempting to suppose a matrix with orthogonal (not orthonormal) columns would be called an orthogonal matrix, but such matrices have no special interest and no special name; they only satisfy , with a diagonal matrix.

The determinant of any orthogonal matrix is +1 or −1. This follows from basic facts about determinants, as follows:
formula_15

The converse is not true; having a determinant of ±1 is no guarantee of orthogonality, even with orthogonal columns, as shown by the following counterexample.
formula_16

With permutation matrices the determinant matches the signature, being +1 or −1 as the parity of the permutation is even or odd, for the determinant is an alternating function of the rows.

Stronger than the determinant restriction is the fact that an orthogonal matrix can always be diagonalized over the complex numbers to exhibit a full set of eigenvalues, all of which must have (complex) modulus 1.

===Group properties===
The inverse of every orthogonal matrix is again orthogonal, as is the matrix product of two orthogonal matrices. In fact, the set of all orthogonal matrices satisfies all the axioms of a group. It is a compact Lie group of dimension , called the orthogonal group and denoted by .

The orthogonal matrices whose determinant is +1 form a path-connected normal subgroup of of index 2, the special orthogonal group of rotations. The quotient group is isomorphic to , with the projection map choosing [+1] or [−1] according to the determinant. Orthogonal matrices with determinant −1 do not include the identity, and so do not form a subgroup but only a coset; it is also (separately) connected. Thus each orthogonal group falls into two pieces; and because the projection map splits, is a semidirect product of by . In practical terms, a comparable statement is that any orthogonal matrix can be produced by taking a rotation matrix and possibly negating one of its columns, as we saw with matrices. If is odd, then the semidirect product is in fact a direct product, and any orthogonal matrix can be produced by taking a rotation matrix and possibly negating all of its columns. This follows from the property of determinants that negating a column negates the determinant, and thus negating an odd (but not even) number of columns negates the determinant.

Now consider orthogonal matrices with bottom right entry equal to 1. The remainder of the last column (and last row) must be zeros, and the product of any two such matrices has the same form. The rest of the matrix is an orthogonal matrix; thus is a subgroup of (and of all higher groups).

formula_17

Since an elementary reflection in the form of a Householder matrix can reduce any orthogonal matrix to this constrained form, a series of such reflections can bring any orthogonal matrix to the identity; thus an orthogonal group is a reflection group. The last column can be fixed to any unit vector, and each choice gives a different copy of in ; in this way is a bundle over the unit sphere with fiber .

Similarly, is a subgroup of ; and any special orthogonal matrix can be generated by Givens plane rotations using an analogous procedure. The bundle structure persists: . A single rotation can produce a zero in the first row of the last column, and series of rotations will zero all but the last row of the last column of an rotation matrix. Since the planes are fixed, each rotation has only one degree of freedom, its angle. By induction, therefore has
formula_18
degrees of freedom, and so does .

Permutation matrices are simpler still; they form, not a Lie group, but only a finite group, the order  symmetric group . By the same kind of argument, is a subgroup of . The even permutations produce the subgroup of permutation matrices of determinant +1, the order alternating group.

===Canonical form===
More broadly, the effect of any orthogonal matrix separates into independent actions on orthogonal two-dimensional subspaces. That is, if is special orthogonal then one can always find an orthogonal matrix , a (rotational) change of basis, that brings into block diagonal form:

formula_19

where the matrices are rotation matrices, and with the remaining entries zero. Exceptionally, a rotation block may be diagonal, . Thus, negating one column if necessary, and noting that a reflection diagonalizes to a +1 and −1, any orthogonal matrix can be brought to the form
formula_20

The matrices give conjugate pairs of eigenvalues lying on the unit circle in the complex plane; so this decomposition confirms that all eigenvalues have absolute value 1. If is odd, there is at least one real eigenvalue, +1 or −1; for a rotation, the eigenvector associated with +1 is the rotation axis.

===Lie algebra===
Suppose the entries of are differentiable functions of , and that gives . Differentiating the orthogonality condition
formula_21
yields
formula_22

Evaluation at () then implies
formula_23

In Lie group terms, this means that the Lie algebra of an orthogonal matrix group consists of skew-symmetric matrices. Going the other direction, the matrix exponential of any skew-symmetric matrix is an orthogonal matrix (in fact, special orthogonal).

For example, the three-dimensional object physics calls angular velocity is a differential rotation, thus a vector in the Lie algebra formula_24 tangent to . Given , with being a unit vector, the correct skew-symmetric matrix form of is
formula_25

The exponential of this is the orthogonal matrix for rotation around axis by angle ; setting , ,
formula_26

==Numerical linear algebra==

===Benefits===
Numerical analysis takes advantage of many of the properties of orthogonal matrices for numerical linear algebra, and they arise naturally. For example, it is often desirable to compute an orthonormal basis for a space, or an orthogonal change of bases; both take the form of orthogonal matrices. Having determinant ±1 and all eigenvalues of magnitude 1 is of great benefit for numeric stability. One implication is that the condition number is 1 (which is the minimum), so errors are not magnified when multiplying with an orthogonal matrix. Many algorithms use orthogonal matrices like Householder reflections and Givens rotations for this reason. It is also helpful that, not only is an orthogonal matrix invertible, but its inverse is available essentially free, by exchanging indices.

Permutations are essential to the success of many algorithms, including the workhorse Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (where permutations do the pivoting). However, they rarely appear explicitly as matrices; their special form allows more efficient representation, such as a list of indices.

Likewise, algorithms using Householder and Givens matrices typically use specialized methods of multiplication and storage. For example, a Givens rotation affects only two rows of a matrix it multiplies, changing a full multiplication of order to a much more efficient order . When uses of these reflections and rotations introduce zeros in a matrix, the space vacated is enough to store sufficient data to reproduce the transform, and to do so robustly. (Following , we do &quot;not&quot; store a rotation angle, which is both expensive and badly behaved.)

===Decompositions===
A number of important matrix decompositions involve orthogonal matrices, including especially:

;decomposition : , orthogonal, upper triangular
;Singular value decomposition : , and orthogonal, diagonal matrix
;Eigendecomposition of a symmetric matrix (decomposition according to the spectral theorem) : , symmetric, orthogonal, diagonal
;Polar decomposition : , orthogonal, symmetric positive-semidefinite

====Examples====
Consider an overdetermined system of linear equations, as might occur with repeated measurements of a physical phenomenon to compensate for experimental errors. Write , where is , .
A decomposition reduces to upper triangular . For example, if is then has the form
formula_27

The linear least squares problem is to find the that minimizes , which is equivalent to projecting to the subspace spanned by the columns of . Assuming the columns of (and hence ) are independent, the projection solution is found from . Now is square () and invertible, and also equal to . But the lower rows of zeros in are superfluous in the product, which is thus already in lower-triangular upper-triangular factored form, as in Gaussian elimination (Cholesky decomposition). Here orthogonality is important not only for reducing to , but also for allowing solution without magnifying numerical problems.

In the case of a linear system which is underdetermined, or an otherwise non-invertible matrix, singular value decomposition (SVD) is equally useful. With factored as , a satisfactory solution uses the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, , where merely replaces each non-zero diagonal entry with its reciprocal. Set to .

The case of a square invertible matrix also holds interest. Suppose, for example, that is a rotation matrix which has been computed as the composition of numerous twists and turns. Floating point does not match the mathematical ideal of real numbers, so has gradually lost its true orthogonality. A Gram–Schmidt process could orthogonalize the columns, but it is not the most reliable, nor the most efficient, nor the most invariant method. The polar decomposition factors a matrix into a pair, one of which is the unique &quot;closest&quot; orthogonal matrix to the given matrix, or one of the closest if the given matrix is singular. (Closeness can be measured by any matrix norm invariant under an orthogonal change of basis, such as the spectral norm or the Frobenius norm.) For a near-orthogonal matrix, rapid convergence to the orthogonal factor can be achieved by a &quot;Newton&#x27;s method&quot; approach due to (1990), repeatedly averaging the matrix with its inverse transpose. has published an accelerated method with a convenient convergence test.

For example, consider a non-orthogonal matrix for which the simple averaging algorithm takes seven steps
formula_28
and which acceleration trims to two steps (with = 0.353553, 0.565685).

formula_29

Gram-Schmidt yields an inferior solution, shown by a Frobenius distance of 8.28659 instead of the minimum 8.12404.

formula_30

===Randomization===
Some numerical applications, such as Monte Carlo methods and exploration of high-dimensional data spaces, require generation of uniformly distributed random orthogonal matrices. In this context, &quot;uniform&quot; is defined in terms of Haar measure, which essentially requires that the distribution not change if multiplied by any freely chosen orthogonal matrix. Orthogonalizing matrices with independent uniformly distributed random entries does not result in uniformly distributed orthogonal matrices, but the decomposition of independent normally distributed random entries does, as long as the diagonal of contains only positive entries . replaced this with a more efficient idea that later generalized as the &quot;subgroup algorithm&quot; (in which form it works just as well for permutations and rotations). To generate an orthogonal matrix, take an one and a uniformly distributed unit vector of dimension . Construct a Householder reflection from the vector, then apply it to the smaller matrix (embedded in the larger size with a 1 at the bottom right corner).

===Nearest orthogonal matrix===

The problem of finding the orthogonal matrix nearest a given matrix is related to the Orthogonal Procrustes problem. There are several different ways to get the unique solution, the simplest of which is taking the singular value decomposition of and replacing the singular values with ones. Another method expresses the explicitly but requires the use of a matrix square root:
formula_31

This may be combined with the Babylonian method for extracting the square root of a matrix to give a recurrence which converges to an orthogonal matrix quadratically:
formula_32
where .

These iterations are stable provided the condition number of is less than three.

Using a first-order approximation of the inverse and the same initialization results in the modified iteration:

formula_33
formula_34
formula_35

==Spin and pin==
A subtle technical problem afflicts some uses of orthogonal matrices. Not only are the group components with determinant +1 and −1 not connected to each other, even the +1 component, , is not simply connected (except for SO(1), which is trivial). Thus it is sometimes advantageous, or even necessary, to work with a covering group of SO(&quot;n&quot;), the spin group, . Likewise, has covering groups, the pin groups, Pin(&quot;n&quot;). For , is simply connected and thus the universal covering group for . By far the most famous example of a spin group is , which is nothing but , or the group of unit quaternions.

The Pin and Spin groups are found within Clifford algebras, which themselves can be built from orthogonal matrices.

==Rectangular matrices==
If is not a square matrix, then the conditions and are not equivalent. The condition says that the columns of &quot;Q&quot; are orthonormal. This can only happen if is an matrix with (due to linear dependence). Similarly, says that the rows of are orthonormal, which requires .

There is no standard terminology for these matrices. They are variously called &quot;semi-orthogonal matrices&quot;, &quot;orthonormal matrices&quot;, &quot;orthogonal matrices&quot;, and sometimes simply &quot;matrices with orthonormal rows/columns&quot;.

For the case , matrices with orthonormal columns may be referred to as orthogonal k-frames and they are elements of the Stiefel manifold.

<doc id="105621" wikidata="Q964987" url="?curid=105621" title="Music of Spain">
<text>In Spain, music Has played an important role in the development of Western music, and has greatly influenced Latin American music. Spanish music is often associated with traditional styles such as flamenco and classical guitar. While these forms of music are common, there are many different traditional musical and dance styles across the regions. For example, music from the north-west regions is heavily reliant on bagpipes, the jota is widespread in the centre and north of the country, and flamenco originated in the south. Spanish music played a notable part in the early developments of western classical music, from the 15th through the early 17th century. The breadth of musical innovation can be seen in composers like Tomás Luis de Victoria, styles like the zarzuela of Spanish opera, the ballet of Manuel de Falla, and the classical guitar music of Francisco Tárrega. Nowadays, in Spain as elsewhere, the different styles of commercial popular music are dominant.

==Origins of the music of Spain==
The Iberian Peninsula has had a history of receiving different musical influences from around the Mediterranean Sea and across Europe. In the two centuries before the Christian era, Roman rule brought with it the music and ideas of Ancient Greece; early Christians, who had their own differing versions of church music arrived during the height of the Roman Empire; the Visigoths, a Romanized Germanic people, who took control of the peninsula following the fall of the Roman Empire; the Moors and Jews in the Middle Ages. Hence, there have been more than two thousand years of internal and external influences and developments that have produced a large number of unique musical traditions.

==Medieval period==
Isidore of Seville wrote about the local music in the 6th century. His influences were predominantly Greek, and yet he was an original thinker, and recorded some of the first details about the early music of the Christian church. He perhaps is most famous in musical history for declaring that it was not possible to notate sounds, an assertion which revealed his ignorance of the notational system of ancient Greece, suggesting that this knowledge had been lost with the fall of the Roman Empire in the west.

The Moors of Al-Andalus were usually relatively tolerant of Christianity and Judaism, especially during the first three centuries of their long presence in the Iberian peninsula, during which Christian and Jewish music continued to flourish. Music notation was developed in Spain as early as the 8th century (the so-called Visigothic neumes) to notate the chant and other sacred music of the Christian church, but this obscure notation has not yet been deciphered by scholars, and exists only in small fragments. The music of the early medieval Christian church in Spain is known, misleadingly, as the &quot;Mozarabic Chant&quot;, which developed in isolation prior to the Islamic invasion and was not subject to the Papacy&#x27;s enforcement of the Gregorian chant as the standard around the time of Charlemagne, by which time the Muslim armies had conquered most of the Iberian peninsula. As the Christian reconquista progressed, these chants were almost entirely replaced by the Gregorian standard, once Rome had regained control of the Iberian churches. The style of Spanish popular songs of the time is presumed to have been heavily influenced by the music of the Moors, especially in the south, but as much of the country still spoke various Latin dialects while under Moorish rule (known today as the Mozarabic) earlier musical folk styles from the pre-Islamic period continued in the countryside where most of the population lived, in the same way as the Mozarabic Chant continued to flourish in the churches. In the royal Christian courts of the reconquistors, music like the Cantigas de Santa Maria, also reflected Moorish influences. Other important medieval sources include the Codex Calixtinus collection from Santiago de Compostela and the Codex Las Huelgas from Burgos. The so-called Llibre Vermell de Montserrat (red book) is an important devotional collection from the 14th century.

==Renaissance and Baroque periods==

In the early Renaissance, Mateo Flecha el Viejo and the Castilian dramatist Juan del Encina ranked among the main composers in the post-Ars Nova period. Renaissance song books included the Cancionero de Palacio, the Cancionero de Medinaceli, the Cancionero de Upsala (kept in Carolina Rediviva library), the Cancionero de la Colombina, and the later Cancionero de la Sablonara. The organist Antonio de Cabezón stands out for his keyboard compositions and mastery.

An early 16th-century polyphonic vocal style developed in Spain was closely related to that of the Franco-Flemish composers. Merging of these styles occurred during the period when the Holy Roman Empire and the Burgundy were part of the dominions under Charles I (king of Spain from 1516 to 1556), since composers from the North of Europe visited Spain, and native Spaniards traveled within the empire, which extended to the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. Music composed for the vihuela by Luis de Milán, Alonso Mudarra and Luis de Narváez was one of the main achievements of the period. The Aragonese Gaspar Sanz authored the first learning method for guitar. Spanish composers of the Renaissance included Francisco Guerrero, Cristóbal de Morales, and Tomás Luis de Victoria (late Renaissance period), all of whom spent a significant portion of their careers in Rome. The latter was said to have reached a level of polyphonic perfection and expressive intensity equal or even superior to Palestrina and Lassus . Most Spanish composers returned home from travels abroad late in their careers to spread their musical knowledge in their native land, or in the late 16th century to serve at the Court of Philip II.
==18th to 20th centuries==

By the end of the 17th century the &quot;classical&quot; musical culture of Spain was in decline, and was to remain that way until the 19th century. Classicism in Spain, when it arrived, was inspired by Italian models, as in the works of Antonio Soler. Some outstanding Italian composers such as Domenico Scarlatti and Luigi Boccherini were appointed to the Madrid royal court. The short-lived Juan Crisóstomo Arriaga is credited as the main beginner of Romantic sinfonism in Spain. 

Although symphonic music was never too important in Spain, chamber, solo instrumental (mainly guitar and piano) vocal and opera (both traditional opera, and the Spanish version of the singspiel) music was written by local composers. Zarzuela, a native form of opera that includes spoken dialogue, is a secular musical genre which developed in the mid-17th century, flourishing most importantly in the century after 1850. Francisco Asenjo Barbieri was a key figure in the development of the romantic zarzuela; whilst later composers such as Ruperto Chapí, Federico Chueca and Tomás Bretón brought the genre to its late 19th-century apogee. Leading 20th-century zarzuela composers included Pablo Sorozábal and Federico Moreno Torroba.

Fernando Sor, Dionisio Aguado, Francisco Tárrega and Miguel Llobet are known as composers of guitar music. Fine literature for violin was created by Pablo Sarasate and Jesús de Monasterio.

Musical creativity mainly moved into areas of popular music until the nationalist revival of the late Romantic era. Spanish composers of this period included Felipe Pedrell, Isaac Albéniz, Enrique Granados, Joaquín Turina, Manuel de Falla, Jesús Guridi, Ernesto Halffter, Federico Mompou, Salvador Bacarisse, and Joaquín Rodrigo. 
==Performers==


In the realm of classical music, Spain boasts a rich tradition of accomplished singers and performers who have made significant contributions to the global musical landscape. The country hosts a vibrant classical music scene, characterized by a multitude of professional orchestras and esteemed opera houses.

With over forty professional orchestras spread across its regions, Spain serves as a hub for orchestral excellence. Among these ensembles, notable names include the Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona, Orquesta Nacional de España, and the Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid. These orchestras showcase the nation&#x27;s commitment to fostering musical talent and nurturing classical repertoire.

In addition to its orchestral prowess, Spain boasts a selection of distinguished opera houses that serve as pillars of the classical music community. Among these institutions, the Teatro Real, the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Teatro Arriaga, and the El Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía stand as esteemed venues renowned for their commitment to showcasing world-class opera productions. These opera houses provide platforms for both established and emerging singers to showcase their talents on a prestigious stage.

During the 1940s, Spanish music was shaped by the aftermath of the Civil War and Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship. Traditional genres like flamenco and classical music continued to thrive, albeit under strict censorship. Popular music forms such as zarzuela and pasodoble celebrated Spanish identity. The era reflected a complex interplay of cultural resilience, political control, and the influence of broader European events like World War II. Overall, music in 1940s Spain mirrored a society in transition, navigating between tradition and the constraints of authoritarian rule.

==Yé-yé==


The Yé-yé movement, stemming from the English pop-refrain &quot;yeah-yeah,&quot; took on a unique form in various cultural contexts, notably in France and Spain. Initially coined in France to describe a genre influenced by American rock and British beat music of the early 1960s, such as the twist, Yé-yé music quickly gained popularity for its lively and uplifting characteristics. In Spain, Concha Velasco is often credited as the catalyst for the Yé-yé scene with her 1965 hit &quot;La Chica Ye-Yé.&quot; However, even before Velasco&#x27;s breakthrough, artists like Karina had already begun making significant strides with their infectious tunes as early as 1963. These pioneering female singers not only popularized Yé-yé music but also set the stage for a vibrant cultural movement characterized by catchy melodies and youthful exuberance.

==Popular music in Spain==


Spanish pop music&#x27;s journey through the tumultuous years of Francisco Franco&#x27;s regime was marked by resilience and adaptation. Despite strict censorship and limited outlets for contemporary music, the Benidorm International Song Festival emerged as a beacon of opportunity for Spanish musicians. Inspired by Italy&#x27;s San Remo Music Festival, Benidorm provided a crucial platform for artists to showcase new musical styles to eager audiences. This festival not only introduced international influences but also nurtured local talent, laying the groundwork for future developments in Spanish pop. An injured Real Madrid football player-turned-singer, for example, became the world-famous Julio Iglesias. During the 1960s and early 1970s, tourism boomed, bringing yet more musical styles from the rest of the continent and abroad. During Franco&#x27;s rule, which heavily restricted women&#x27;s rights and roles in public life, female artists faced additional barriers in expressing themselves through music. However, some managed to break through these constraints, contributing to the vibrant underground music scene that emerged despite censorship. Artists like Marisol, who started as a child star in the 1960s, and Rocío Dúrcal, who became a prominent figure in Spanish music and film, navigated these challenges to become beloved icons of their time.
The 1980s ushered in a transformative era with &quot;La Movida Madrileña&quot;, a countercultural movement centered in Madrid. This period was pivotal for Spain&#x27;s pop music scene, fostering a spirit of experimentation and creativity across diverse genres such as electronica, Euro disco, rock, punk, and hip-hop. Spanish pop music began to carve out its own distinctive identity, moving beyond emulation of Anglo-American trends to embrace originality and diversity. La Movida not only revitalized artistic expression but also catalyzed the industry&#x27;s growth, setting the stage for Spain&#x27;s emergence as a powerhouse in global music. Female artists such as Alaska (of Alaska y los Pegamoides and later Fangoria) and Martirio emerged as influential figures, challenging traditional gender roles and exploring new sounds and styles. 

Julio Iglesias, Enrique Iglesias, and Alejandro Sanz stand as icons of Spanish pop music&#x27;s international success. These artists not only captivated audiences within Spain but also resonated globally, showcasing the universal appeal of Spanish-language music. Julio Iglesias, in particular, achieved unprecedented success as the best-selling male Latin artist of all time, illustrating the enduring impact of Spanish pop on the global music landscape. In Spain itself, the 1990s were characterized by a vibrant underground music scene that thrived in major cities like Madrid and Barcelona. Alternative rock bands such as Los Planetas and Dover gained prominence, bringing a fresh energy to Spanish pop with their indie rock influences and experimental sounds. This period also saw the emergence of electronic music and dance clubs, further diversifying the musical landscape and fostering a new generation of DJs and producers. The integration of Spanish and Latin American music markets further amplified this influence, fostering a dynamic cultural exchange that continues to shape trends and innovation in the industry. Mónica Naranjo, known for her powerful vocals and dramatic performances, and Ana Belén, whose sophisticated style and versatile voice made her a prominent figure. These artists contributed to a diverse and vibrant era in Spanish music, each leaving a lasting impact with their distinctive contributions to the genre.

Artists like Enrique Iglesias and Alejandro Sanz have become successful internationally winning major music awards such as the Grammy Award. As Spanish is commonly spoken in Spain and most of Latin America, music from both regions have been able to crossover with each other. According to the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE), Spain is the largest Latino music market in the world. As a result, the Latin music industry encompasses Spanish-language music from Spain. The Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, the organization responsible for the Latin Grammy Awards, includes music from Spain including a category for Best Flamenco Album with voting members living in the country.

==Music by region==
The regions of Spain have distinctive musical traditions. There is also a movement of singer-songwriters with politically active lyrics, paralleling similar developments in Latin America and Portugal. The singer and composer Eliseo Parra (b 1949) has recorded traditional folk music from the Basque country and Castile as well as his own compositions inspired from the musical styles of Spain and abroad.

===Andalusia===


Though Andalusia is best known for flamenco music, there is also a tradition of gaita rociera (tabor pipe) music in western Andalusia and a distinct violin and plucked-string type of band music known as panda de verdiales in Málaga.

Sevillanas is related to flamenco and most flamenco performers have at least one classic sevillana in their repertoire. The style originated as a medieval Castilian dance, called the seguidilla, which was adopted with a flamenco style in the 19th century. Today, this lively couples&#x27; dance is popular in most parts of Spain, though the dance is often associated with the city of Seville&#x27;s famous Easter feria.

The region has also produced singer-songwriters like Javier Ruibal and , who revived a traditional music called &quot;copla&quot;. Catalan Kiko Veneno and Joaquín Sabina are popular performers in a distinctly Spanish-style rock music, while Sephardic musicians like Aurora Moreno, Luís Delgado and Rosa Zaragoza keep Andalusian Sephardic music alive.

===Aragon===

Jota, popular across Spain, might have its historical roots in the southern part of Aragon. Jota instruments include the castanets, guitar, bandurria, tambourines and sometimes the flute. The guitarro, a unique kind of small guitar also seen in Murcia, seems Aragonese in origin. Besides its music for stick-dances and dulzaina (shawm), Aragon has its own gaita de boto (bagpipes) and chiflo (tabor pipe). As in the Basque country, Aragonese chiflo can be played along to a chicotén string-drum (psaltery) rhythm.

===Asturias, Cantabria and Galicia===


Northwest Spain (Asturias, Galicia and Cantabria) is home to a distinct musical tradition extending back into the Middle Ages. The signature instrument of the region is the gaita (bagpipe). The gaita is often accompanied by a snare drum, called the tamboril, and is played in processional marches. Other instruments include the requinta, a kind of fife, as well as harps, fiddles, rebec and &quot;zanfona&quot; (hurdy-gurdy). The music itself runs the gamut from uptempo muiñeiras to stately marches. As in the Basque Country, Cantabrian music also features intricate arch and stick dances but the tabor pipe does not play as an important role as it does in Basque music. Traditionally, Galician music included a type of chanting song known as alalas. Alalas may include instrumental interludes, and were believed to have a very long history, based on legends.

There are local festivals of which Ortigueira&#x27;s &quot;Festival Internacional do Mundo Celta&quot; is especially important. Drum and bagpipe couples range among the most beloved kinds of Galician music, that also includes popular bands like Milladoiro. &quot;Pandereteiras&quot; are traditional groups of women that play tambourines and sing - bands like Tanxugueiras are directly influenced by this tradition. The bagpipe virtuosos Carlos Núñez and Susana Seivane are especially popular performers.

Asturias is also home to popular musicians such as José Ángel Hevia (bagpiper) and the group Llan de cubel. Circular dances using a 6/8 tambourine rhythm are a hallmark of this area. Vocal asturianadas show melismatic ornamentations similar to those of other parts of the Iberian Peninsula. There are many festivals, such as &quot;Folixa na Primavera&quot; (April, in Mieres), &quot;Intercelticu d&#x27;Avilés&quot; (Interceltic festival of Avilés, in July), as well as many &quot;Celtic nights&quot; in Asturias.

===Balearic Islands===
In the Balearic Islands, &quot;Xeremiers&quot; or &quot;colla de xeremiers&quot; are a traditional ensemble that consists of flabiol (a five-hole tabor pipe) and xeremias (bagpipes). Majorca&#x27;s Maria del Mar Bonet was one of the most influential artists of nova canço, known for her political and social lyrics. Tomeu Penya, Biel Majoral, Cerebros Exprimidos and Joan Bibiloni are also popular.

===Basque Country===

The most popular kind of Basque music is named after the dance trikitixa, which is based on the accordion and tambourine. Popular performers are Joseba Tapia and Kepa Junkera. Highly appreciated folk instruments are the txistu (a tabor pipe similar to Occitanian galoubet recorder), alboka (a double clarinet played in circular-breathing technique, similar to other Mediterranean instruments like launeddas) and txalaparta (a huge xylophone, similar to the Romanian toacă and played by two performers in a fascinating game-performance). As in many parts of the Iberian peninsula, there are ritual dances with sticks, swords and arches made from vegetation. Other popular dances are the fandango, jota and 5/8 zortziko.

Basques on both sides of the Spanish-French border have been known for their singing since the Middle Ages, and a surge of Basque nationalism at the end of the 19th century led to the establishment of large Basque-language choirs that helped preserve their language and songs. Even during the persecution of the Francisco Franco era (1939–1975), when the Basque language was outlawed, traditional songs and dances were defiantly preserved in secret, and they continue to thrive despite the popularity of commercially marketed pop music.

===Canary Islands===
In the Canary Islands, Isa, a local kind of Jota, is now popular, and Latin American musical (Cuban) influences are quite widespread, especially with the charango (a kind of guitar). Timple, a local instrument which resembles ukulele / cavaquinho, is commonly seen in plucked-string bands. A popular set on El Hierro island consists of drums and wooden fifes (pito herreño). The tabor pipe is customary in some ritual dances on the island of Tenerife.

===Castile, Madrid and León===

A large inland region, Castile, Madrid and Leon were Celtiberian country before its annexation and cultural latinization by the Roman Empire but it is extremely doubtful that anything from the musical traditions of the Celtic era have survived. Ever since, the area has been a musical melting pot; including Roman, Visigothic, Jewish, Moorish, Italian, French and Roma influences, but the longstanding influences from the surrounding regions and Portugal continue to play an important role. Areas within Castile and León generally tend to have more musical affinity with neighboring regions than with more distant parts of the region. This has given the region diverse musical traditions.

Jota is popular, but is uniquely slow in Castile and León, unlike its more energetic Aragonese version. Instrumentation also varies much from the one in Aragon. Northern León, that shares a language relationship with a region in northern Portugal and the Spanish regions of Asturias and Galicia, also shares their musical influences. Here, the gaita (bagpipe) and tabor pipe playing traditions are prominent. In most of Castile, there is a strong tradition of dance music for dulzaina (shawm) and rondalla groups. Popular rhythms include 5/8 charrada and circle dances, jota and habas verdes. As in many other parts of the Iberian peninsula, ritual dances include paloteos (stick dances). Salamanca is known as the home of tuna, a serenade played with guitars and tambourines, mostly by students dressed in medieval clothing. Madrid is known for its chotis music, a local variation to the 19th-century schottische dance. Flamenco, although not considered native, is popular among some urbanites but is mainly confined to Madrid.

===Catalonia===

Though Catalonia is best known for sardana music played by a cobla, there are other traditional styles of dance music like ball de bastons (stick-dances), galops, ball de gitanes. Music is at the forefront in cercaviles and celebrations similar to Patum in Berga. Flabiol (a five-hole tabor pipe), gralla or dolçaina (a shawm) and sac de gemecs (a local bagpipe) are traditional folk instruments that make part of some coblas.

Catalan gipsies and Andalusian immigrants to Catalonia created their own style of rumba called &quot;rumba catalana&quot; which is a popular style that&#x27;s similar to flamenco, but not technically part of the flamenco canon. The rumba catalana originated in Barcelona when the rumba and other Afro-Cuban styles arrived from Cuba in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Catalan performers adapted them to the flamenco format and made it their own. Though often dismissed by aficionados as &quot;fake&quot; flamenco, rumba catalana remains wildly popular to this day.

The havaneres singers remain popular. Nowadays, young people cultivate Rock català popular music, as some years ago the Nova Cançó was relevant.

===Extremadura===
Having long been the poorest part of Spain, Extremadura is a largely rural region known for the Portuguese influence on its music. As in the northern regions of Spain, there is a rich repertoire for tabor pipe music. The zambomba friction-drum (similar to Portuguese sarronca or Brazilian cuica) is played by pulling on a rope which is inside the drum. It is found throughout Spain. The jota is common, here played with triangles, castanets, guitars, tambourines, accordions and zambombas.

===Murcia===
Murcia is a region in the south-east of Spain which, historically, experienced considerable Moorish colonisation, is similar in many respects to its neighbour, Andalusia. The guitar-accompanied cante jondo Flamenco style is especially associated with Murcia as are &quot;rondallas&quot;, plucked-string bands. Christian songs, such as the polyphonic chant of the &quot;Auroro&quot; singers, are traditionally sung a cappella, sometimes accompanied by the sound of church bells, and cuadrillas are festive songs primarily played during holidays, like Christmas.

===Navarre and La Rioja===
Navarre and La Rioja are small northern regions with diverse cultural elements. Bordered by Aragon and the Basque Autonomous Community, they also share much of the music found in those two regions. Northern Navarre is Basque in language, while the Southern section shares more Aragonese features. The jota genre is also known in both Navarre and La Rioja. Both regions have rich dance and dulzaina (shawm) traditions. Txistu (tabor pipe) and dulzaina ensembles are very popular in the public celebrations of Navarre.

===Valencia===
Traditional music from Valencia is characteristically Mediterranean in origin. Valencia also has its local kind of Jota. Moreover, Valencia has a high reputation for musical innovation, and performing brass bands called &quot;bandes&quot; are common, with one appearing in almost every town. Dolçaina (shawm) is widely found. Valencia also shares some traditional dances with other Iberian areas, like for instance, the ball de bastons (stick-dances).
The group Al Tall is also well-known, experimenting with the Berber band Muluk El Hwa, and revitalizing traditional Valencian music, following the Riproposta Italian musical movement.

<text>In number theory, Euler&#x27;s criterion is a formula for determining whether an integer is a quadratic residue modulo a prime. Precisely,

Let &quot;p&quot; be an odd prime and &quot;a&quot; be an integer coprime to &quot;p&quot;. Then

:formula_1

Euler&#x27;s criterion can be concisely reformulated using the Legendre symbol:
:formula_2

The criterion dates from a 1748 paper by Leonhard Euler.

==Proof==

The proof uses the fact that the residue classes modulo a prime number are a field. See the article prime field for more details.

Because the modulus is prime, Lagrange&#x27;s theorem applies: a polynomial of degree can only have at most roots. In particular, has at most 2 solutions for each . This immediately implies that besides 0 there are at least distinct quadratic residues modulo : each of the possible values of can only be accompanied by one other to give the same residue.

In fact, formula_3This is because formula_4
So, the formula_5 distinct quadratic residues are:
formula_6
As is coprime to , Fermat&#x27;s little theorem says that
:formula_7
which can be written as
:formula_8
Since the integers mod form a field, for each , one or the other of these factors must be zero. Therefore,

:formula_9 or

:formula_10

Now if is a quadratic residue, ,
:formula_11
So every quadratic residue (mod ) makes the first factor zero.

Applying Lagrange&#x27;s theorem again, we note that there can be no more than values of that make the first factor zero. But as we noted at the beginning, there are at least distinct quadratic residues (mod ) (besides 0). Therefore, they are precisely the residue classes that make the first factor zero. The other residue classes, the nonresidues, must make the second factor zero, or they would not satisfy Fermat&#x27;s little theorem. This is Euler&#x27;s criterion.

===Alternative proof===

This proof only uses the fact that any congruence formula_12 has a unique (modulo formula_13) solution formula_14 provided formula_13 does not divide formula_16. (This is true because as formula_14 runs through all nonzero remainders modulo formula_13 without repetitions, so does formula_19: if we have formula_20, then formula_21, hence formula_22, but formula_23 and formula_24 aren&#x27;t congruent modulo formula_13.) It follows from this fact that all nonzero remainders modulo formula_13 the square of which isn&#x27;t congruent to formula_27 can be grouped into unordered pairs formula_28 according to the rule that the product of the members of each pair is congruent to formula_27 modulo formula_13 (since by this fact for every formula_31 we can find such an formula_14, uniquely, and vice versa, and they will differ from each other if formula_33 is not congruent to formula_27). If formula_27 is not a quadratic residue, this is simply a regrouping of all formula_36 nonzero residues into formula_37 pairs, hence we conclude that formula_38. If formula_27 is a quadratic residue, exactly two remainders were not among those paired, formula_40 and formula_41 such that formula_42. If we pair those two absent remainders together, their product will be formula_43 rather than formula_27, whence in this case formula_45. In summary, considering these two cases we have demonstrated that for formula_46 we have formula_47. It remains to substitute formula_48 (which is obviously a square) into this formula to obtain at once Wilson&#x27;s theorem, Euler&#x27;s criterion, and (by squaring both sides of Euler&#x27;s criterion) Fermat&#x27;s little theorem.

==Examples==
Example 1: Finding primes for which &quot;a&quot; is a residue

Let &quot;a&quot; = 17. For which primes &quot;p&quot; is 17 a quadratic residue?

We can test prime &quot;p&quot;&#x27;s manually given the formula above.

In one case, testing &quot;p&quot; = 3, we have 17(3 − 1)/2 = 171 ≡ 2 ≡ −1 (mod 3), therefore 17 is not a quadratic residue modulo 3.

In another case, testing &quot;p&quot; = 13, we have 17(13 − 1)/2 = 176 ≡ 1 (mod 13), therefore 17 is a quadratic residue modulo 13. As confirmation, note that 17 ≡ 4 (mod 13), and 22 = 4.

We can do these calculations faster by using various modular arithmetic and Legendre symbol properties.

If we keep calculating the values, we find:
:(17/&quot;p&quot;) = +1 for &quot;p&quot; = {13, 19, ...} (17 is a quadratic residue modulo these values)

:(17/&quot;p&quot;) = −1 for &quot;p&quot; = {3, 5, 7, 11, 23, ...} (17 is not a quadratic residue modulo these values).

Example 2: Finding residues given a prime modulus &quot;p&quot; 

Which numbers are squares modulo 17 (quadratic residues modulo 17)?

We can manually calculate it as:
: 12 = 1
: 22 = 4
: 32 = 9
: 42 = 16
: 52 = 25 ≡ 8 (mod 17)
: 62 = 36 ≡ 2 (mod 17)
: 72 = 49 ≡ 15 (mod 17)
: 82 = 64 ≡ 13 (mod 17).

So the set of the quadratic residues modulo 17 is {1,2,4,8,9,13,15,16}. Note that we did not need to calculate squares for the values 9 through 16, as they are all negatives of the previously squared values (e.g. 9 ≡ −8 (mod 17), so 92 ≡ (−8)2 = 64 ≡ 13 (mod 17)).

We can find quadratic residues or verify them using the above formula. To test if 2 is a quadratic residue modulo 17, we calculate 2(17 − 1)/2 = 28 ≡ 1 (mod 17), so it is a quadratic residue. To test if 3 is a quadratic residue modulo 17, we calculate 3(17 − 1)/2 = 38 ≡ 16 ≡ −1 (mod 17), so it is not a quadratic residue.

Euler&#x27;s criterion is related to the law of quadratic reciprocity.

==Applications==

In practice, it is more efficient to use an extended variant of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm to calculate the Jacobi symbol formula_49. If formula_50 is an odd prime, this is equal to the Legendre symbol, and decides whether formula_27 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_50.

On the other hand, since the equivalence of formula_53 to the Jacobi symbol holds for all odd primes, but not necessarily for composite numbers, calculating both and comparing them can be used as a primality test, specifically the Solovay–Strassen primality test. Composite numbers for which the congruence holds for a given formula_27 are called Euler–Jacobi pseudoprimes to base formula_27.

<text>Warren &quot;Baby&quot; Dodds (December 24, 1898 – February 14, 1959) was an American jazz drummer born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He is regarded as one of the best jazz drummers of the pre-big band era. He varied his drum patterns with accents and flourishes, and he generally kept the beat with the bass drum while playing buzz rolls on the snare. Early influences included Louis Cottrell, Sr., Dave Perkins, and Tubby Hall. Dodds was among the first drummers to be recorded improvising while performing.

==Early years==
&quot;Baby&quot; Dodds was the younger brother of clarinetist Johnny Dodds. His mother, who died when he was nine years old, taught him valuable lessons about persistence and putting one&#x27;s whole effort into endeavors, and he carried these with him through his career as a jazz drummer. He was born into a very musical family. His father and uncle played violin and his sister played harmonica. In addition, his father was religious and the family regularly sang hymns together. Dodds, in his autobiography &quot;The Baby Dodds Story&quot;, told the story of making his first drum: &quot;I took a lard can and put holes in the bottom and turned it over and took nails and put holes around the top of it. Then I took some rungs out of my mother&#x27;s chairs and made drumsticks out of them&quot;. At age 16, Dodds saved up enough money to buy his own drum set. Although Dodds had several paid teachers during his early years as a drummer, various jazz drummers around New Orleans also influenced him. He started playing in street parades around New Orleans with Bunk Johnson and his band and then gained a job playing in Willie Hightower&#x27;s band, the American Stars. The band played in various venues around New Orleans, and Dodds recalled hearing many musicians along the way, including Buddy Bolden, John Robichaux, and Jelly Roll Morton. He played with several different outfits including those of Frankie Duson and Sonny Celestin, and he was part of the New Orleans tradition of playing jazz during funeral marches. Dodds describes this experience in his autobiography: &quot;The jazz played after New Orleans funerals didn&#x27;t show any lack of respect for the person being buried. It rather showed their people that we wanted them to be happy&quot;.

==Prime years==
Dodds gained a reputation as a top young drummer in New Orleans. In 1918, Dodds left Sonny Celestin&#x27;s group to play in Fate Marable&#x27;s riverboat band. A teenaged Louis Armstrong also joined the band, and the two of them were on the boats together. The band played on four different boats, and usually left New Orleans in May and traveled to St. Louis, though they also sometimes traveled further north. They played jazz, popular, and classical music while on the boats. Dodds and Armstrong left Fate Marable&#x27;s band in 1921 due to a disagreement about musical style, and Dodds soon joined King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band. At this time, the personnel in Oliver&#x27;s band were Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver on cornet, Baby Dodds&#x27; brother Johnny Dodds on clarinet, Davey Jones on alto saxophone, Honoré Dutrey on trombone, Lil Hardin on piano, Jimmy Palao on violin, and Eddie Garland on bass fiddle. They moved to California in 1921 to work with Oliver there, and they played together for about fifteen months. In 1922, the band, excepting Garland, Palao, and Jones, followed Oliver to Chicago, which would be his base of operations for several years. They began playing at the Lincoln Gardens, and Armstrong also joined this outfit. Dodds describes playing with this band as &quot;a beautiful experience&quot;. King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band broke up in 1924 due to disagreements about travel and musical style; the argument became so heated that the Dodds brothers threatened to beat up Oliver. Dodds recorded with Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Art Hodes, and his brother Johnny Dodds. Dodds played in Armstrong&#x27;s Hot Five and Hot Seven groups. In May 1927, Armstrong recorded with the Hot Seven, which consisted of Johnny Dodds, Johnny St. Cyr, Lil Hardin Armstrong, John Thomas, Pete Briggs, and Baby Dodds. From September to December 1927, the Hot Five Armstrong assembled consisted of Johnny Dodds, Kid Ory, Johnny St. Cyr, Lonnie Johnson, and Baby Dodds. During the decade, he also performed with the Black Bottom Stompers, Chicago Footwarmers, Willie Hightower, and Charlie Elgar.

==Later years==
During the 1930s, Dodds performed with Lil Hardin, Natty Dominique, and the Three Deuces&#x27;s house band.

After the Oliver band broke up, the Dodds brothers played at Burt Kelley&#x27;s Stables in Chicago, and soon after, Johnny Dodds began leading his own outfit, of which Baby was a part. Johnny Dodds died of a stroke in 1940. Of his brother, Baby Dodds said the following: &quot;There just couldn&#x27;t be another Johnny Dodds or anyone to take his place. And his passing on made a big difference in my life. I had been connected with him for many years and from then on I had to be wholly on my own&quot;. After his brother&#x27;s death, Baby Dodds worked mostly as a freelance drummer around Chicago. This was the time of the New Orleans Revival, which was a movement in response to the emerging style of bebop. Many jazz traditionalists wanted jazz to return to its roots during this time. Dodds, having remained a New Orleans style drummer untouched by the influence of swing, found himself playing a role in the New Orleans jazz revival. In 1941, he played with Jimmie Noone and his band for a short time. This band featured Mada Roy on piano, Noone on clarinet, Bill Anderson on bass, and Dodds on drums. Dodds stayed with this outfit for only three months before they went to California, while Dodds decided to stay in Chicago. In the late 1940s he worked at Jimmy Ryan&#x27;s in New York City. On some of his trips back to New Orleans, he recorded with Bunk Johnson. Dodds ended up playing with Johnson&#x27;s band in New York. Dodds described his impressions of New York as a place where people listened to jazz rather than dancing to it: &quot;When I first went to New York it seemed very strange to have people sitting around and listening rather than dancing. In a way, it was similar to theatre work. But it was peculiar for me because I always felt as though I was doing something for the people if they danced to the music&quot;. After playing with several outfits in New York, he joined Mezz Mezzrow&#x27;s group on a tour of Europe in 1948 that lasted eight weeks. The group ended up playing solely in France, and Dodds had a great experience, saying that Europeans &quot;take our kind of music much more seriously than they do in our own country&quot;. They played at the Nice Festival along with Rex Stewart, Louis Armstrong, and several other American jazz musicians.

Dodds returned to Chicago after the European tour and while taking a trip to New York in April 1949, he suffered a stroke. In 1950 he had his second stroke and in 1952 suffered a third. After his three strokes, Dodds tutored and played in public as much as he could, though he was unable to complete entire performances. He retired in 1957. He died on February 14, 1959, in Chicago, and was buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Blue Island, Illinois.

==The relationship between Baby and Johnny==
Several accounts of the Dodds brothers suggest that they did not always get along. When the brothers were younger, Johnny got a clarinet from his father but Baby did not get a drum even though he asked for one. In &quot;The Baby Dodds Story&quot;, Dodds discusses his jealousy of his older brother when they were children. As they grew up, Johnny refused to let Baby play music with him because Baby was a heavy drinker and Johnny did not drink. When Joe Oliver hired Baby and Johnny saw how much Baby&#x27;s talent as a drummer had grown, however, Johnny changed his mind. Although they continued to argue about Baby&#x27;s drinking habits, they grew closer as brothers and musicians, and as suggested above, Baby was greatly affected by his brother&#x27;s death.

==The validity of &quot;The Baby Dodds Story&quot;==
In 1959, Larry Gara&#x27;s &quot;The Baby Dodds Story&quot; was published for the first time. The revised edition was published in 1992. Several critics have questioned the validity of this book, given the fact that it is solely Baby Dodds giving an extensive interview, and therefore the events in the book are based on what Dodds himself remembers. In his introduction, Gara explains the interview process, which took place in 1953, every Sunday for about twelve weeks. Gara&#x27;s wife transcribed the interview between Gara and Dodds, and Gara then edited the interviews. Gara wanted this book to be Baby Dodds telling his story rather than Gara telling it. Gara did, however, exhibit the same concerns that various critics have exhibited: one person may not remember things exactly as they happened. He, therefore, consulted jazz historian Bill Russell, who helped Gara check Dodds&#x27; interviews for details that historical findings did not support. The finished product is a narrative by Baby Dodds with minimal footnotes from Gara. Although some details may be exaggerated, &quot;The Baby Dodds Story&quot; serves as a depiction of early jazz and its many influences as seen through Dodds&#x27; eyes.

==Recording sessions==
In many of his recordings, Dodds had to use a wood block rather than a drum set because of the nature of the recording technology. It was therefore difficult to hear Dodds&#x27; original style from early recordings, such as his 1923 sessions with King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band. Dodds did, however, begin recording again in 1940, and by this time, the technology was able to show his talent on the drum set. Dodds is perhaps the first jazz drummer to record unaccompanied: in 1945 he recorded two solos for Circle Records, and the next year recorded a series of solos and reminiscences for Folkways Records. On his part of the record, Dodds discusses his drumming techniques and his drumset and playing examples of techniques. This record gives an idea of what Dodds would have sounded like in his prime had the recording technology been what it is today. In 1954, he played for a Natty Dominique recording session which also featured bassman Israel Crosby and pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong.

==Dodds&#x27; drumming style==
Dodds continues to be admired for the creativity of his playing. He believed in playing something different for every chorus of every tune. Most of his contemporaries played a short buzz or press roll on the backbeats (the 2nd and 4th beats), but Dodds played a long roll that lasted till the following beat, which created a smoother time feel that he later developed into the jazz ride pattern most commonly used ever since. Dodds was best known, however, for what he called his &quot;shimmy beat&quot;, which he first used in 1918 at Jack Sheehan&#x27;s in New Orleans. He described it in his autobiography: &quot;One night a French soldier came in. When he heard the music he couldn&#x27;t dance to it, but he just started to shake all over. That&#x27;s the way it affected me. I saw him do it and I did it, too&quot;. Dodds&#x27; unique shimmy beat caught Louis Armstrong&#x27;s eye as well, who said: &quot;To watch him play, especially when he beat on the rim of his bass in a hot chorus, he sort of shimmied when he beat with his sticks. Oh! Boy that alone was in my estimation the whole worth of admission&quot;. Besides his unique drumming style, something important to Dodds was paying attention to the musicians in the outfit and fitting his drumming into the style the band was playing. He tried to get to know each member in the outfit and learn about how each person played his or her instrument. Throughout his autobiography, Dodds talks about listening to the different band members and using his role as a drummer to help the band come together: &quot;It was my job to study each musician and give a different background for each instrument. When a man is playing it&#x27;s up to the drummer to give him something to make him feel the music and make him work. That&#x27;s the drummer&#x27;s job&quot;.

Notable is the absence of the hi-hat cymbals and stands. Dodds never liked them: &quot;I didn&#x27;t like them and I still don&#x27;t. Some drummers can&#x27;t play without them. I can&#x27;t play with them.&quot;

Baby Dodds also played washboard. He recorded together with his brother&#x27;s washboard band occasionally (Victor BVE 46063-6).

==Induction into the &quot;Downbeat&quot; Hall of Fame==
In 2010, &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine&#x27;s Veterans Committee inducted Dodds into the DownBeat Hall of Fame. The Veterans Committee specifically looks at jazz artists who are no longer living who were overlooked for one reason or another while they were alive. The article in &quot;DownBeat&quot; about Dodds&#x27; induction again blames the recording technology in the 1920s, and it also acknowledges the fact that when Dodds was in his prime, the hi-hat had not yet been invented. By today&#x27;s standards, Dodds played with an incomplete drum set for much of his career.

==Further research==

<text>Gustavus (Lingít: &quot;Wanachích T’aak Héen&quot;) () is a second-class city in Hoonah-Angoon Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. The 2020 census population was 655, which represents a 48% increase over the 2010 census of 442 and is one of the fastest growing communities in Alaska.

==History==
Gustavus, formerly known as &quot;Strawberry Point&quot;, lies on the outwash plain created by the glaciers that once filled Glacier Bay. Two hundred years ago, it was primarily a single large &quot;beach&quot;. The native Tlingit people and others used the area for fishing, berry picking, and other similar uses. The first settlers arrived in 1914, but left shortly afterward. The first permanent homestead was established in 1917, when Abraham Lincoln Parker moved his family to Strawberry Point. Many Gustavus residents are descendants and relatives of the original Parker homesteaders.

In 1925 the name became &quot;Gustavus&quot;, when the U.S. Post Office required a change for its new post office, although locals continued calling it &quot;Strawberry Point&quot; long afterwards. The new name came from Point Gustavus at the mouth of Glacier Bay.

In 1793 George Vancouver named Point Adolphus (at the northern tip of Chichagof Island, and today a well-known humpback whale feeding area) after Adolphus Frederick, seventh son of King George III. In 1878, W. H. Dall, while working on a coastal survey, saw &quot;Adolphus&quot; on the map and assumed it was for Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus. The point across Icy Strait from Point Adolphus at the mouth of Glacier Bay was not named on the map, so Dall called it &quot;Gustavus&quot;. Another possibility is that Dall named Gustavus for Gustavus C. Hanus, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who had extensive experience throughout southeast Alaska, and both Dall and Hanus served with the Coast Survey in Alaska. Hanus laid out the first streets in Juneau and helped quell the trouble in Klukwan in 1881.

There is still a large beach at Gustavus, with many strawberries. The city is surrounded on three sides by Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, and on the fourth side by water. The area is a temperate rain forest; spruce and hemlock trees reach heights of , and alders, balsam poplar, fern, mosses, fireweed, lupine, and other plants are also common. Gustavus&#x27;s coastal location gives it a relatively mild winter. Summer temperatures range from ; winter temperatures from .

==Geography==
Gustavus is located at (58.416327, -135.745549).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 11.16%, are water.

Gustavus is split by the Salmon River, a small waterway crossed by a bridge for the paved road running out to Glacier Bay National Park. Coho salmon, Dolly Varden, and other fish are commonly caught in this river. Within the city limits, the river is affected by tides.

==Climate==
Gustavus has a wet, maritime subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc) with short, mild summers and long, cold winters.

==Demographics==

Gustavus first appeared on the 1940 U.S. Census as &quot;Strawberry Point&quot;, an unincorporated village. In 1950, it returned as Gustavus. It was made a census-designated place (CDP) in 1980. Its status was changed to an incorporated city in 2004.
As of the census of 2000, there were 429 people, 199 households, and 114 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 345 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 89% white, 0% Black or African American, 4% Native American, 0.2% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 2% from other races, and 4% from two or more races. 1.4% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Of the 199 households, 28% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47% were married couples living together, 6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43% were non-families. 38% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.2 and the average family size was 2.9.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 26% under the age of 18, 3% from 18 to 24, 30% from 25 to 44, 36% from 45 to 64, and 5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 130 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 135 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $34,800, and the median income for a family was $51,800. Males had a median income of $41,800 versus $29,400 for females. The per capita income for the city was $21,100. 15% of the population and 10% of families were below the poverty line. 13% of those under the age of 18 and 14% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.

==Economy==
The Gustavus economy is strongly linked to the surrounding natural resources; tourism and commercial fishing are mainstays. However, the importance of commercial fishing is in decline, as the Dungeness crab fishery in Glacier Bay National Park was closed in the early 2000s and the fishing for Dungeness outside of the national park has become poor. Salmon and halibut remain as the primary catch of the commercial fishing done out of Gustavus. Those not involved in tourism or seafood typically work for the government at the public school, the post office, the National Park Service, or the City of Gustavus.

The hardware and grocery store is called ToshCo, named after its owner and the fact that most of its inventory is from the Costco in Juneau.

==Transportation==
Gustavus is not connected to the contiguous highway system. Gustavus Airport and the Alaska Marine Highway provide access between Gustavus and the outside world. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the ferry system shut down and Gustavus became even more isolated, relying on private boats for grocery shipments.

<text>Hoonah ( or &quot;Gaaw Yat’aḵ Aan&quot;) is a largely Tlingit community on Chichagof Island, located in Alaska&#x27;s panhandle in the southeast region of the state. It is west of Juneau, across the Alaskan Inside Passage. Hoonah is the only first-class city on Chichagof Island, the 109th-largest island in the world and the 5th-largest island in the U.S. At the 2020 census the population was 931, up from 760 in 2010. In the summer the population can swell to over 1,300 depending on fishing, boating, hiking and hunting conditions.

&quot;Hoonah&quot; became the official spelling in 1901, with establishment of the Hoonah branch of the United States Post Office. &quot;Hoonah&quot; is the approximate pronunciation of the Tlingit name , which means “lee of the north wind”, i.e., protected from the north wind.

==History==
The clans comprising the Huna Tlingit originally settled what is now Glacier Bay National Park as well as Icy Strait, Cross Sound, and the outer coast north to Sea Otter Creek. Two catastrophic events forced the Tlingit from their homeland; rapid glacial advance in Glacier Bay and a landslide-induced tsunami in Lituya Bay along the outer coast. Tlingit oral tradition recounts these events as well as the clans&#x27; ultimate resettlement in Xunaa.

A partial timeline of modern Hoonah history is below:

*1750s - Xunaa was settled by clans fleeing glacial advance in Glacier Bay.
*1880 - The North West Trading Company built the first store in Hoonah.
*1881 - The Presbyterian Home Mission and school was built.
*1887 - 450 to 500 people were wintering in the village.
*1901 - Hoonah post office was opened.
*1912 - The Hoonah Packing Co. built a large cannery north of town. The cannery was shut down after decades of use and is now a tourist attraction at Icy Strait Point.
*1934, 1936 - Hoonah Indian Association was constituted as a federally recognized tribe, authorized to act on behalf of the Huna Tlingit.
*1944 - A fire destroyed much of Hoonah, including many priceless Tlingit cultural objects. The United States federal government assisted in rebuilding Hoonah.
*1953 - Last year that Icy Strait Salmon Company operated as a full-fledged canning operation. From this point until 1999 the property functioned as a maintenance and support facility for the seine boat fishing fleet.
*1964 - First graduating class from Hoonah High School, in May.
*2001 - Groundbreaking ceremony for Icy Strait Point, at abandoned Hoonah Packing Company site. 
*2004 - Celebrity MV &quot;Mercury&quot; makes inaugural call at Icy Strait Point.
*2007 - ZipRider! The world&#x27;s largest zipline opens at Icy Strait Point.
*2010 - Alaska State Troopers assisted Hoonah police in a 2-day manhunt for a man who was reported to be armed in a wooded area in the city. He was later apprehended without incident.
*2010 - A fire and subsequent series of explosions destroyed the Icy Strait Lumber Mill. No criminal activity was suspected in the fire.
*2010 - Two police officers from the city were shot and killed in an ambush on Front Street. The suspect subsequently barricaded himself inside his own home on August 29, 2010. State, local and federal law enforcement officers and SWAT personnel from agencies throughout Alaska responded in the wake of the shooting. The suspect, John Marvin, was taken into custody the next day.

The town of Hoonah is featured on the Discovery Channel show &quot;Alaskan Bush People&quot;.

===Education and schools===

Sheldon Jackson established the first school house and teacher&#x27;s residence in November 1881. The school was initially overseen by Mr. and Mrs. Walter B. Styles of New York until their transfer to Sitka in 1882. The Reverend and Mrs. John McFarland assumed responsibility for the school in 1884, and by 1885 219 Tlingit students were enrolled: 69 boys, 76 girls and 74 adults. A territorial school and government school were built in 1923. In 1932 the government school was demolished and replaced by a Bureau of Indian Affairs school.

Hoonah City Schools currently serves the needs of Hoonah&#x27;s elementary and secondary students. Six graduating seniors made up the Hoonah City Schools class of 2015.

===Hoonah Packing Company===

The Hoonah Packing Company (&quot;HPC&quot;), built in 1912, was one of eight canneries operating in the area during the early twentieth century, representing Hoonah&#x27;s major industry at the time. HPC was sold several times until coming to be owned by Wards Cove Packing, which also owned Hoonah Trading. The cannery ceased operating in 1954, but continued to see use by commercial fishermen for storing and repairing their boats and gear.
==Geography==

Hoonah is on the north shore of Chichagof Island, on Icy Strait, at (58.109435, -135.436349). The communities of Whitestone Logging Camp (which was being dismantled in early 2011) and Game Creek just south of the city limits. The port at Hoonah is called Port Frederick. Other incorporated communities nearby on Chichagof Island include Tenakee Springs to the south and Pelican to the west. A study began in 2009 regarding the feasibility of a road from Hoonah to Pelican and possibly connecting to Tenakee Springs to allow an energy corridor to hot spring thermal energy sources in the region for Hoonah, to lower heating and energy costs. Most Tenakee residents expressed opposition to the road, while Pelican has generally supported the idea. The road would save the Alaska Department of Transportation ferry costs in summer snow-free months, by connecting these areas to Hoonah.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Hoonah has a total area of , of which are land and , or 17.59%, are water.

Tongass National Forest borders the area and has an unpaved road system of over . Recreation areas include Game Creek, Kennel Creek, and Freshwater Bay which has a small boat harbor, all to the east; and Whitestone boat landing and False Bay recreation area to the southeast. These areas are inaccessible in winter due to deep snow.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Hoonah has a humid continental climate (Dfb), or an oceanic climate (Cfb) depending on the isotherm used.

==Demographics==

Hoonah first reported on the 1880 U.S. Census as the Tlingit settlement of Koudekan. It reported as &quot;Huna&quot; on the 1890 U.S. Census. It next appeared on the 1900 U.S. Census as &quot;Hooniah.&quot; From 1910 onwards, it appeared as Hoonah. It formally incorporated in 1946.

Hoonah is the principal village for the Huna Tlingit who originally settled Glacier Bay, Icy Strait, Cross Sound, and the Outer Coast. The four original Tlingit clans present are Chookaneidi, T&#x27;aakdeintaan, Wooshkeetaan, and Kaagwaantaan. Numerous other clans migrated to, or married into, the community, as have non-native peoples.

As of the census of 2000, there were 860 people, 300 households, and 215 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 348 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 28.72% White, 0.23% Black or African American, 60.58% Native American, 0.12% Asian, 0.81% from other races, and 9.53% from two or more races. 3.60% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 300 households, out of which 33.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52.3% were married couples living together, 12.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.3% were non-families. 22.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.83 and the average family size was 3.34.

In the city, the age distribution of the population shows 29.2% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 26.5% from 25 to 44, 27.3% from 45 to 64, and 7.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 112.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 115.2 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $39,028, and the median income for a family was $45,125. Males had a median income of $37,083 versus $23,958 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,097. About 14.3% of families and 16.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.1% of those under age 18 and 10.4% of those age 65 or over.

The old fish cannery, which ceased operations in the 1950s, located near Icy Strait, was obtained by the Huna Totem Corporation (HTC), the village ANCSA Corporation. The road to the site, Cannery Road, was paved in 2000 and the site was converted into a tourism destination for cruise ship passengers. From May to September, cruise ships anchor off Icy Strait Point, and visits from ship passengers enhance Hoonah&#x27;s warm-weather economy weekly. The former Hoonah Air Force Station, once a White Alice Communications System facility during the Cold War, which closed in the mid-1970s, is now the start point of a zip-line, one of the longest in the world, which ends at the cannery site. The cruise ship passengers, visiting fishing vessels, and summertime boaters who dock in the Hoonah city small boat harbor, all bring revenue to the city. The closing of the logging industry in southeast Alaska hurt the town economically in the early 1990s, but limited logging, tourism and fishing have helped to replace the void.

Hunters, hikers, campers, boaters and fishers all visit Hoonah as tourists throughout the year. The mild weather, much like that of Seattle, attracts tourists to the city.

==Transportation==
Hoonah, being an island community, is only accessible by boat or plane.

===Ferry===
The Alaska Marine Highway serves Hoonah with the M/V &quot;LeConte&quot; with recent gaps in coverage due to state funding and needed repair work. The ferry service has traditionally offered residents a slower but more dependable and cheaper option to travel to and from Hoonah to Juneau.

The city of Hoonah operates a small boat harbor, a large vessel mooring harbor and a new boat haul-out facility. The Alaska Department of Transportation built a new ferry facility that opened in early 2001 in Hoonah.

===Airport===
The Hoonah Airport was expanded in 2011 and now has a runway. The airport is planned for expansion to better allow military C-130s from the Coast Guard and Air National Guard to land in Hoonah.

The airport offers service via bush carrier Alaska Seaplanes which offers multiple flights a day between Hoonah and Juneau and other local communities. Connections can be made in Juneau with Alaska Airlines for regional and interstate travel or to other bush carriers traveling to remote villages or communities from Juneau.

==Infrastructure==
Hoonah has a K-12 school with approximately 120 students. There are two grocery stores, a fuel dealership, hardware store, bar, hotel and restaurant-bar, two cafes, an auto service center, several gift shops, several bed and breakfasts, a U.S. post office, a regional U.S. Forest Service office for Tongass National Forest, a fish processing facility, and a sporting goods store. In 2015, a local brewery was established under the name Hoonah Brewing Company. Plans are underway to build a new jail.

The city is an Alaskan first class city and provides all municipal services including police, utilities and road maintenance. The city also maintains a city park, built in 2010 near the harbor, and a youth activity center.

The police department has a five-bed jail and employs four paid police officers, along with volunteer reserve officers. The Hoonah volunteer Emergency Medical Service (EMS) was recognized by the state of Alaska in 2009 for excellence, and the Hoonah Volunteer Fire Department was accredited by the Alaska Fire Commission in 2010. The Alaska State Troopers have an office post in Hoonah, with one &quot;brown shirt&quot; wildlife enforcement trooper-pilot posted there.

The Alaska Courts maintain a court house in Hoonah for district court, presided over by a magistrate.

The Hoonah Indian Association maintains a tribal office, a senior citizens center and other services to local tribal members.

==Health care==
The SEARHC Hoonah Health Center (or SEARHC Hoonah Medical Center) is the primary health clinic in the community. Its senior staff are Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners. The facility operates as part of the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium (or SEARHC). It is open Monday through Friday for primary care and acute concerns, and offers assistance after hours in emergency situations. In the summer of 2015, the health center was moved to a new, larger facility. Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau, roughly 40 miles away (or an approximately 20 minute flight), is the nearest hospital. Because no roads lead in or out of Hoonah, individuals in need of dire medical attention are often airlifted to Juneau or Sitka via air ambulance or Coast Guard helicopter. The community is also served by local Emergency Medical Service. The volunteer EMS team retains two fully functioning ambulances as well as a modified ambulance for off-road emergencies.

==Religion==
Hoonah has eight churches:

* Sacred Heart Parish (Roman Catholic)
* St. Nicholas Eastern Orthodox Church
* Harbor of Faith Lutheran Church
* Hoonah United Presbyterian Church ()
* Abundant Life Christian Fellowship (Assemblies of God)
* Hoonah Pentecostal Church (United Pentecostal)
* The Salvation Army Corps, Center for Worship and Service
* Hoonah Baptist Fellowship

==History==

===Shipwreck===

According to legend, many years ago when Russian ships roamed Alaska waters, one foundered in the uncharted waters of Cross Sound. Survivors rowed their lifeboat up an inlet that would later be known as Lisianski. In a sheltered cove, they founded a settlement. They cleared and planted gardens, trapped, and hunted game. The story goes that a shipyard was built and a ship constructed, which allowed them to return to their homeland.

When the Russian settlement died, the land again reverted to wilderness. Early hunters and trappers noticed the clearing in the woods and found iron and copper tools along with sunken graves. They named the abandoned settlement &quot;Sunnyside&quot;.

The Lisianski Inlet Lodge is located on the site of the old Russian settlement at Sunnyside, and the owners can attest to there being &quot;mounds&quot; nearby in the trees that may be burial sites and finding tools in the ground.

In the late 1970s, Paul Corbin found what appears to be a spike from a Russian ship while digging a garbage pit a few hundred yards behind the Lodge. A few years later Denny Corbin found a pair of eyeglasses while digging to enforce a coffer dam in the woods behind the lodge. The eyeglasses had gold rims, blue glass, and diamond-shaped pieces of jade in each corner.

===Mining exploration===

By 1938 the Lisianski Inlet had become home to gold miners. Hjalmar Mork, Jack Ronning and the older of the Mork family boys operated the Mork mine, called the Goldwin Prospect.
Besides the Mork mine, there was a gold mine called the Apex, founded earlier, which can be found across the inlet from Sunnyside. The Apex-El Nido mine produced 18,000 ounces of gold. Jack Koby was developing a mine called Lucky Strike up towards the head of the inlet, and another mine was being worked at its mouth. This is the Lisianski Inlet Kalle (Charley) Raatikainen found when he started looking for a place to build a town.

===1938–1941 fish processing and storage development===

Raatikainen was an Alaskan pioneer and fish buyer when fish made people wealthy. During the fishing season, he would hardly sleep, as he bought fish and ran them from the fishing grounds to Sitka. Raatikainen would leave Deer Harbor when the last troller had unloaded for the night. He would arrive in Sitka around three in the morning awaken the crew, unload, pick up groceries and arrive back on the fishing grounds by noon. Hoping to give better and faster service to the fishermen and buyers, he began looking for a place to build a cold storage plant close to the fishing grounds.

====Location and pilings====

Raatikainen went to his friend Hjalmar Mork and told him what he was looking for. On August 2, 1938, Hjalmar took him to a place up the inlet near his mine and suggested the location. Raatikainen found a harbor with deep water, land, and a large lake with a waterfall. Located between Juneau and Sitka, the site had everything he was looking for.

Raatikainen organized a corporation and brought in a crew to start the building. On September 26, 1938, his boat the &quot;Pelican&quot; brought in Bob DeArmond as timekeeper and storekeeper, Eli Rapich as cook&#x27;s helper, and another cook known as Slim. Others may have been Don White and Gust Savela. A. P. &quot;Coho&quot; Walder and his wife Martha arrived with their troller and Raatikainen had one or two others with him when he brought in his fish scows. One scow was put on the beach and became the mess house with worker quarters in the upper section. The other scow was anchored out and connected to the beach by a floating walkway. It served as a warehouse as well as living quarters for workers. The town site became known as Pelican City. Why is not known, but probably not to confuse it with Raatikainen&#x27;s boat the &quot;Pelican&quot;.

Joe and Jim Paddock came with their pile-driving equipment. They used their donkey engine on the pile driver to clear timber from the cold storage site. Hjalmer Mork and Jack Ronning moved their air compressor and jackhammers up from their mine to clear rock from the cold storage site.

====Building supplies====

The steam schooner the &quot;SS Tongass&quot; arrived and dropped overboard tons of lumber and pilings in front of the town, despite Raatikainen&#x27;s lack of funds. DeArmond was the one who had to request that the captain of the &quot;Tongass&quot; defer the payment. A sawmill and other supplies were loaded on rafts and dragged ashore. The &quot;SS Tongass&quot; would be the only steamer into Pelican for the next few years with supplies but not regularly.

The first building erected ashore had a dual purpose. It housed a Finnish steam bath on one side and on the other a store and offices for the new corporation. During this time, Pelican was often referred to as &quot;Finn Town&quot;. The town started looking like a town when the Paddocks and Raatikainen built homes. Arthur Silverman arrived from Sitka with lumber, beer, and a license to operate a beer parlor and soon was open for business.

The expense of building a cold storage, acquiring diesel engines, and building a water and electric system left the company short of money. Raatikainen went to Seattle and raised money, but it was never enough. The town continued to grow because the depression left little winter work elsewhere. Fishermen and others were willing to take food, tobacco, and stock in the company for their work.

====Fire and general expansion====

There was a major setback when the bathhouse caught fire and the only available fire equipment was a few buckets of salt water brought up from the beach. The bath/store building was quickly replaced and would later become home to Pelican&#x27;s first school. One of the first major construction sites was a two-story multipurpose building. On the first floor a kitchen and mess hall occupied one end with the office, store and later the post office on the other side. The upper floor was used for a bunkhouse. This building&#x27;s second floor is still used as a bunkhouse.

Gus Savela, a Finn and Alaskan fish buyer with engineering experience, oversaw the building of the dam. With the sawmill that had arrived on the &quot;Tongass&quot;, the Paddock brothers built the wharf, fish house and started the boardwalk. When the summer fishing season began, the men left to work other jobs or fish their boats and even Raatikainen had to take his scows to their summer stations.

Work slowed in 1939, when the Navy began building a base on Japonski Island and outside jobs became available. Even so, a post office under the name &quot;Pelican&quot; was established on November 27, 1939, with Bob DeArmond as first postmaster. Pelican&#x27;s school opened with Arvo Wahto, of Douglas, becoming its first teacher. He would teach two generations of children before retiring in the 60&#x27;s. A sawmill was built and put into operation producing the lumber to build homes adding to the permanence of the town.

In the summer of 1940 things got livelier when A. R. Breuger of Wrangell brought his floating cannery to Pelican and moored it to the dock. It brought new people and small seine boats to town, and employment to a few of the residents. By the summer of 1941 Pelican had another salmon cannery. The Cape Cross Salmon Company organized by Larry Freeburn and Pros Ganty put canning machinery and a retort in the fish house, they made a pack of more than 17,000 cases. Later, Cape Cross would build a separate cannery next to the cold storage.

====Completion====

Henry Roden, the former attorney general of Alaska who was helping Raatikainen raise money, finally had success when Norton Clapp agreed to participate in the project. The work of getting the cold storage plant operating immediately gathered speed. J. P. McNeil, who had been in charge of the Booth Fisheries cold storage at Sitka for many years, was hired as manager to oversee the installation of the refrigeration machinery. The hydroelectric power plant was completed and a new office and store building were attached to the cold storage.

In August 1942 the first fish was loaded into the sharp freezer. The census in 1939 gave Pelican a count of 48. In 1951 it was up to 180, it would later reach its peak at 250.

===Recent history===

Pelican Seafoods closed for business in July 2008. The city foreclosed on the seafood plant in 2010. However, by 2016, a new fish processing business, Yakobi Fisheries, had begun to operate in Pelican.

==Education==
Pelican School District is the school district of the city.

<text>The Municipality and Borough of Skagway is a borough in Alaska on the Alaska Panhandle. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,240, up from 968 in 2010. The population doubles in the summer tourist season in order to deal with the large number of summer tourists each year. Incorporated as a borough on June 25, 2007, it was previously a city (urban Skagway located at ) in the Skagway-Yakutat-Angoon Census Area (now the Hoonah–Angoon Census Area, Alaska). The most populated community is the census-designated place of Skagway.

Skagway, on the Taiya Inlet, was an important saltwater port during the Klondike Gold Rush. The White Pass and Yukon Route narrow gauge railroad, part of the area&#x27;s mining past, now in operation purely for the tourist trade and running throughout the summer months, has its starting point at the port of Skagway. Skagway is a popular stop for cruise ships, and the tourist trade is a big part of the business of Skagway.

Skagway is also the setting for part of Jack London&#x27;s book &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, Will Hobbs&#x27;s book &quot;Jason&#x27;s Gold&quot;, and Joe Haldeman&#x27;s novel, &quot;Guardian&quot;. The John Wayne film &quot;North to Alaska&quot; (1960) was filmed nearby.

The name &quot;Skagway&quot; (historically also spelled Skaguay) is the English divergent of &quot;sha-ka-ԍéi&quot;, a Tlingit idiom which figuratively refers to rough seas in the Taiya Inlet, which are caused by strong north winds. (&quot;See&quot;, &quot;Etymology and the Mythical Stone Woman&quot;, below.)

==History==
===Etymology and the Mythical Stone Woman===
&quot;Skagway&quot; is the English adaptation of &quot;sha-ka-ԍéi&quot;, a Tlingit idiom which figuratively refers to &quot;rough seas in the Taiya Inlet, that are caused by strong north winds&quot;. Literally, &quot;sha-ka-ԍéi&quot; is a verbal noun which means &quot;pretty woman&quot;. The verbal noun was derived from the Tlingit finite verb theme &quot;-sha-ka-li-ԍéi&quot;, which means, in the case of a woman, &quot;to be pretty&quot;.

The story behind the name is that &quot;Sha-ka-ԍéi&quot; or &quot;Skagway&quot; [&quot;Pretty Woman&quot;] was the nickname of Kanagoo, a mythical woman who transformed herself into stone at Skagway Bay and who (according to the story) now causes the strong, channeled winds which blow toward Haines, Alaska. The rough seas caused by these winds have therefore been referred to by the use of Kanagoo&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Sha-ka-ԍéi&quot; or &quot;Skagway&quot;.

The Kanagoo stone formation is now known as Face Mountain, which is seen from Skagway Bay. The Tlingit name for Face Mountain is &quot;Kanagoo Yahaayí&quot; [Kanagoo&#x27;s Image/Soul].

===Early Skagway===

One prominent resident of early Skagway was William &quot;Billy&quot; Moore, a former steamboat captain. As a member of an 1887 boundary survey expedition, he had made the first recorded investigation of the pass over the Coast Mountains, which later became known as White Pass. He believed that gold lay in the Klondike because it had been found in similar mountain ranges in South America, Mexico, California, and British Columbia. In 1887, he and his son, J. Bernard &quot;Ben&quot; Moore, claimed a homestead at the mouth of the Skagway River in Alaska. Moore settled in this area because he believed it provided the most direct route to the potential goldfields. They built a log cabin, a sawmill, and a wharf in anticipation of future gold prospectors passing through.

The boundary between Canada and the United States along the Alaska Panhandle was only vaguely defined then (see Alaska boundary dispute). There were overlapping land claims from the United States&#x27; purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 and British claims along the coast. Canada requested a survey after British Columbia united with it in 1871, but the idea was rejected by the United States as being too costly, given the area&#x27;s remoteness, sparse settlement, and limited economic or strategic interest.
The Klondike gold rush changed everything. In 1896, gold was found in the Klondike region of Canada&#x27;s Yukon Territory. On July 29, 1897, the steamer &quot;Queen&quot; docked at Moore&#x27;s wharf with the first boat load of prospectors. More ships brought thousands of hopeful miners into the new town and prepared for the 500-mile journey to the gold fields in Canada. Moore was overrun by lot jumping prospectors and had his land stolen from him and sold to others.

The population of the general area increased enormously and reached 30,000, composed largely of American prospectors. Some realized how difficult the trek ahead would be en route to the gold fields, and chose to stay behind to supply goods and services to miners. Within weeks, stores, saloons, and offices lined the muddy streets of Skagway. The population was estimated at 8,000 residents during the spring of 1898 with approximately 1,000 prospective miners passing through town each week. By June 1898, with a population between 8,000 and 10,000, Skagway was the largest city in Alaska.

Due to the sudden influx of visitors to Skagway, some town residents began offering miners transportation services to aid them in their journeys to the Yukon, often at highly inflated rates. A group of miners upset with the treatment organized a town council to help protect their interests. But as the members of the council moved north to try their own hands at mining, control of the town reverted to the more unscrupulous, most notably Jefferson Randolph &quot;Soapy&quot; Smith.


Between 1897 and 1898, Skagway was a lawless town, described by one member of the North-West Mounted Police as &quot;little better than a hell on earth.&quot; Fights, prostitutes and liquor were ever-present on Skagway&#x27;s streets, and con man &quot;Soapy&quot; Smith, who had risen to considerable power, did little to stop it. Smith was a sophisticated swindler who liked to think of himself as a kind and generous benefactor to the needy. He was gracious to some, giving money to widows and halting lynchings, while simultaneously operating a ring of thieves who swindled prospectors with cards, dice, and the shell game. His telegraph office charged five dollars to send a message anywhere in the world. Consequently, unknowing prospectors sent news to their families back home without realizing there was no telegraph service to or from Skagway until 1901.

Smith also controlled a comprehensive spy network, a private militia called the Skaguay Military Company, the town newspaper, the Deputy U.S. Marshal&#x27;s office and an array of thieves and con men who roamed about the town. Smith was finally shot and killed by Frank Reid and Jesse Murphy on July 8, 1898, in the famed Shootout on Juneau Wharf. Smith managed to return fire — some accounts claim the two men fired their weapons simultaneously — and Frank Reid died from his wounds twelve days later. Jesse Murphy is believed by some to be responsible for killing Smith, but the official coroner&#x27;s inquest ruled &quot;that said Smith [died] by reason of pistol wound piercing the heart. The said wound was the result of a pistol shot fired by one Frank H. Reid.&quot;

Smith and Reid are now interred at the Klondike Gold Rush Cemetery, also known as &quot;Skagway&#x27;s Boot Hill.&quot;

The prospectors&#x27; journey began for many when they climbed the mountains over the White Pass above Skagway and onward across the Canada–US border to Bennett Lake, or one of its neighboring lakes, where they built barges and floated down the Yukon River to the gold fields around Dawson City. Others disembarked at nearby Dyea, northwest of Skagway, and crossed northward on the Chilkoot Pass, an existing Tlingit trade route to reach the lakes. The Dyea route fell out of favor when larger ships began to arrive, as its harbor was too shallow for them except at high tide. Officials in Canada began requiring that each prospector entering Canada on the north side of the White Pass bring with him one ton (909 kg) of supplies, to ensure that he did not starve during the winter. This placed a large burden on the prospectors and the pack animals climbing the steep pass.

In 1898, a 14-mile, steam-operated aerial tramway was constructed up the Skagway side of the White Pass, easing the burden of those prospectors who could afford the fee to use it. The Chilkoot Trail tramways also began to operate in the Chilkoot Pass above Dyea. In 1896, before the Klondike gold rush had begun, a group of investors saw an opportunity for a railroad over that route. It was not until May 1898 that the White Pass and Yukon Route began laying narrow gauge railroad tracks in Skagway. The railroad depot was constructed between September and December 1898. This destroyed the viability of Dyea, as Skagway had both the deep-water port and the railroad. Construction of McCabe College, the first school in Alaska to offer a college preparatory high school curriculum, began in 1899. The school was completed in 1900.

By 1899, the stream of gold-seekers had diminished and Skagway&#x27;s economy began to collapse. By 1900, when the railroad was completed, the gold rush was nearly over. In 1900, Skagway was incorporated as the first city in the Alaska Territory. Much of the history of Skagway was saved by early residents such as Martin Itjen, who ran a tour bus around the historical town. He was responsible for saving and maintaining the gold- rush cemetery from complete loss. He purchased Soapy Smith&#x27;s saloon (Jeff Smith&#x27;s Parlor) from going the way of the wrecking ball, and placed many early artifacts of the city&#x27;s early history inside and opened Skagway&#x27;s first museum.

In July 1923, President Warren G. Harding visited Skagway while on his historic tour through Alaska. Harding was the first President of the United States to travel and tour Alaska while in office. The Canol pipeline was extended to Skagway in the 1940s where oil was shipped in by sea and pumped north.

==Geography==

Skagway is located at (59.468519, −135.305962).

Skagway is located in a narrow glaciated valley at the head of the Taiya Inlet, the north end of the Lynn Canal, which is the most northern fjord on the Inside Passage on the south coast of Alaska. 
It is in the Alaska panhandle 90 miles northwest of Juneau, Alaska&#x27;s capital city.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (2.5%) is water. It is currently the smallest borough in Alaska, having taken the title away from Bristol Bay Borough at its creation.

===Adjacent boroughs===
* Haines Borough, Alaska – south, west
* Stikine Region, British Columbia – north, east

===National protected areas===
* Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park (part, also in Seattle, Washington)
* Tongass National Forest (part)

===Climate===
Skagway has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dsb&quot;). It is in the rain shadow of the coastal mountains, and though not as pronounced as the rain shadow in Southcentral Alaska in the valley of the Susitna River, this still allows it to receive only half as much precipitation as Juneau and only a sixth as much as Yakutat. Although winters are too cold for the classification, precipitation patterns resemble a mediterranean climate due to the summer precipitation minimum. The highest temperature recorded in Skagway is in three separate years, most recently in 2019, and the lowest is on February 2, 1947.

North winds prevail at Skagway from November to March. South winds prevail from April to October.

==Demographics==
Skagway first appeared on the 1900 U.S. Census, having incorporated as a city that same year. It was the 2nd largest city in Alaska, behind fellow Gold Rush boomtown Nome. It reported 3,117 residents, of which 2,845 were White, 113 were Native Americans, 98 were Black and 61 were Asian. It rapidly declined to 872 residents by 1910, falling to the 8th largest city. It reported 802 Whites, 61 Native Americans and 9 Others. It would be 90 years (until 2000) before it would almost reach that population again (862). It fell to 15th largest community overall in 1920. By 1930, it bottomed out at 492 residents, although it rose to 13th largest in the state. In 1940, it fell to 16th. By 1950, 19th. 1960, it tied for 29th place (16th largest incorporated). In 1970, it dropped to 45th (24th largest incorporated). In 1980, it rose to 35th place. In 1990, it fell to 53rd place. In 2000, it was at 60th place overall (29th largest incorporated). In 2007, with the creation of the Skagway Municipality out of Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon, it ceased to be an incorporated city and became a census-designated place (CDP). As of 2010, it is the 71st largest community in Alaska.

The per capita income for the city was $27,700. About 1.0% of families and 3.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under age 18 and 4.5% of those age 65 or over.

===Tourism===
There are visitors to the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park and White Pass and Chilkoot Trails. Skagway has a historical district of about 100 buildings from the gold rush era. It receives about a million tourists annually, most of whom (about three quarters) come on cruise ships. The White Pass and Yukon Route operates its narrow-gauge train around Skagway during the summer months, primarily for tourists. The WPYR also ships copper ore from the interior. &quot;The Days of &#x27;98 Show&quot; is performed in Skagway&#x27;s Fraternal Order of Eagles Hall.

==Transportation==

Skagway is one of three Southeast Alaskan communities that are connected to the road system; Skagway&#x27;s connection is via the Klondike Highway, completed in 1978. This allows access to the lower 48, Whitehorse, Yukon, northern British Columbia, and the Alaska Highway. This also makes Skagway an important port-of-call for the Alaska Marine Highway — Alaska&#x27;s ferry system — and serves as the northern terminus of the important and heavily used Lynn Canal corridor. (The other Southeast Alaskan communities with road access are Haines and Hyder.)

The White Pass and Yukon Route is a railway that formerly linked Whitehorse, Yukon in Canada to Skagway, the railway&#x27;s southernmost terminus. Today, trains travel several times a week from May through September from Skagway to the small community of Carcross, approximately 45 miles south/southwest of Whitehorse. There, passengers (mostly tourists) can make connections via bus to Whitehorse.

Skagway Airport receives service from two bush carriers: Alaska Seaplanes, and Air Excursions.

==Media==

===Local radio and newspapers===
Skagway is served by its local semimonthly newspaper, &quot;The Skagway News,&quot; as well as regional public radio station KHNS, which has its principal studios in nearby Haines but also has studios and programs based in Skagway. Juneau radio station KINY operates a translator in Skagway which serves the entire town.

Skagway also receives copies of the free regional newspaper &quot;Capital City Weekly.&quot;

<text>Big Delta is a census-designated place (CDP) in Southeast Fairbanks Census Area, Alaska, United States. The population was 591 at the 2010 census, down from 749 in 2000. Big Delta is at the confluence of the Delta River and the Tanana River and gets its name from the huge river delta formed by the confluence.

== History ==
From at least 10,000 years ago to the present, Athabascan Indians have inhabited portions of the interior of Alaska. They survived by hunting the abundant game and fishing in the rivers of the interior of Alaska.

Beginning in 1899, the United States Army built a pack trail from Valdez, on the south coast of Alaska, to Eagle, northeast of Big Delta, a distance of about . The trail crossed the Tanana River near the confluence of the Delta and Tanana Rivers.

Gold was discovered in 1902 in Fairbanks, about north of the crossing of the Tanana River. Roadhouses were built along the pack trail that connected the south coast of Alaska with Fairbanks. One such roadhouse was Bates Landing, which was built at the confluence of the Delta and Tanana Rivers, about north of the current Delta Junction, in the area known now as Big Delta. The U. S. government collected a toll on the south side of the Tanana River from all passengers crossing north. In 1904 work began on the Richardson Highway, which mostly followed the route of the pack trail.

In 1906, John Hajdukovich bought the roadhouse and enlarged it. In addition to running the lodge there, he took hunting parties into the nearby Granite Mountains and traded with the Athabaskans in the surrounding area. An 18-year-old Swedish girl named Rika Wallen came to the roadhouse to work for John. After several years, John deeded the roadhouse to Rika in lieu of back wages he owed her. Rika also homesteaded an adjoining piece of land. Rika&#x27;s Roadhouse and the adjacent property are now the Big Delta State Historical Park.

In 1928 a herd of bison were brought from the U. S. state of Montana to Big Delta, because they were thought to be threatened with extinction in the continental United States. The herd still roams in the Delta Junction area, about south of Big Delta.

The construction of the Alaska Highway during World War II shifted much of the economic activity of the area south to Delta Junction. Later history of the area can be found in the entry for Delta Junction.

<text>Chicken is a tiny unincorporated village in Southeast Fairbanks Census Area, Alaska. A community founded on gold mining, it is one of the few surviving gold-rush towns in Alaska. The population was 12 at the time of the 2020 census, up from 7 in 2010. However, usually year round, there are 17 inhabitants. Due to mining, Chicken&#x27;s population peaks during the summer. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.
Chicken has a cafe with gas station, a small hotel, an RV park, a small general store and a saloon.

==History==
Chicken was settled by gold miners in the late-19th century. In 1902 the local post office was established, requiring a community name. Due to the prevalence of ptarmigan in the area, that name was suggested as the official name for the new community. However, the spelling could not be agreed on, and &quot;Chicken&quot; was used to avoid embarrassment. However, this is likely apocryphal, since it was popularized in the 1940s, almost 50 years after the town was founded. The most likely origin is from nearby Chicken Creek, as noted by Josiah Edward Spurr in 1896, “The creek is so named from the size of the gold, which is about that of chicken feed (corn).”

A portion of Chicken, with buildings from the early 1900s and the F.E. Company Dredge No. 4 (Pedro Dredge), is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Chicken Historic District. Chicken is the outpost for the 40-Mile mining district. There are still active gold mines and inactive gold dredges in this area. Enough gold was mined here to make it worthwhile to haul huge gold dredges to this remote location.

On September 7, 2021, Jack in the Box released an ad campaign claiming to have purchased the town for 10,000 Cluck Chicken Sandwiches and a commemorative hat. The company explains on a website created for the campaign this was only an ad, but that the company has donated $10,000 to help the town amid the pandemic. However, as of September 2021 the downtown area of Chicken (not owned by Jack in the Box) was for sale, including the Chicken Creek Cafe, the Chicken Creek Saloon, a liquor store, a gas station, the Chicken Mercantile Emporium, and a 1400-sq.-ft. residential cabin.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

Chicken is accessible by air via Chicken Airport, and by road via Alaska Route 5, the Taylor Highway, which is not maintained from mid-October through mid-March.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Chicken has a dry-winter subarctic climate (Koppen: &quot;Dwc&quot;), it is characterized by extremely cold and long winters and warm, short summers. The average temperature of Chicken is , July is the hottest month with , and the coldest month is January with . Although Chicken has a latitude of 64°N, it is hardly affected by the Chinook winds. So far, the maximum temperature in January has never exceeded , and the extreme high temperature in December is also . Even in the hottest months, nighttime temperatures are low enough that there is a greater chance of frost in the hottest months of the year, June and July. Extreme temperatures range from to . Among them, four days of extreme low temperature were recorded, namely January 1, 2000, February 7–8, 2008, and December 31, 1999. Chicken holds the United States record for the coldest temperature ever recorded in the country in December. Chicken’s extreme high temperature was recorded for two days, both occurred on July 4 and 7, 1998. The record cold daily maximum is , set on January 1, 2000, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is on June 9, 2017. The coldest day of the year averaged in the 1991 to 2020 normals, while the warmest night average was at .

==Demographics==

Chicken first appeared as an unincorporated village on the 1930 U.S. Census. It appeared on the 1940 and 1950 censuses, but then did not appear again until 1980, when the Census Bureau selected Chicken to be part of, and name-source for, a census-designated place (CDP). It was then abandoned as a CDP for a decade and the Census Bureau again did not publish the village-only population in 1990, but the CDP was re-established in 2000. Populations available for Chicken from 2000 onward include, therefore, residents of the entire CDP and not just the village proper.

==Depictions in literature==

The biographical novel &quot;Tisha: The Story of a Young Teacher in the Alaskan Wilderness&quot;, by Robert Specht, tells the story of Anne Hobbs, a white teacher in Chicken during the 1920s.

In the short story &quot;The Red Convertible&quot;, by Louise Erdrich, Henry and Lyman take a road trip from Montana to Chicken, Alaska.

<text>Delta Junction (; ), officially the City of Delta Junction, is a small city in Southeast Fairbanks Census Area, Alaska, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 958, up from 840 in 2000. The 2018 estimate was down to 931. The city is located a short distance south of the confluence of the Delta River with the Tanana River, which is at Big Delta. It is about south of Fairbanks. Native inhabitants are Tanana Athabaskans.

== History ==

For at least 10,000 years, Athabascan indigenous peoples have inhabited portions of the interior of Alaska. Early inhabitants survived by hunting and fishing. The early history of non-native settlement in the area occurred at the river crossing at Big Delta and is found at the entry, Big Delta, Alaska.

In 1904, the location first served as a telegraph station. In 1928, a herd of 23 bison were brought from the National Bison Range in Montana to an area south of Big Delta to provide an additional game species for hunters. Buffalo Center, a small community near the center of present-day Delta Junction, was named because of their presence, especially during the winter months. The huge animals were troublesome, and sometimes made landings dangerous at nearby Allen Field.

=== World War II (1941–1945) ===
During World War II, the United States aided the Soviet Union against Germany by sending airplanes and supplies authorized by the Lend-lease Act to the Soviet Union through Alaska into the Russian Far East. The Alaska Highway was built to connect an existing road in Dawson Creek, British Columbia, Canada, with the Richardson Highway in Alaska, a distance of .

The Alaska Highway met the Richardson Highway at a point south along the Delta River from Big Delta. The place where the highways met became known as Delta Junction. Allen Field was constructed south of Delta Junction for use in sending supplies to Russia. The Glenn Highway was built from Anchorage to what is now Glennallen, where it met the Richardson Highway. This connection created a motor route between Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska.

=== Cold War (1945–1991) ===
After World War II, a U.S. army base, Fort Greely, was built next to the air field. The base, and a huge tract of land around it, was used for training soldiers for cold weather combat during the Cold War with the former Soviet Union. In 1957, the Richardson Highway was paved. About this time, portions of the Alaska Highway were also paved. The army base and tourism brought on the highways, caused a boom in the area&#x27;s economy and the commercial center of the area moved from Big Delta to Delta Junction. Some people also began farming and raising livestock in the Delta Junction area. This farming required new techniques to accommodate the short growing season and the cold and dark winters of interior Alaska.

Delta Junction was incorporated on December 19, 1960. Oil was discovered in the North Slope of Alaska in 1968. In 1974, construction began on the pipeline to transport the oil from the North Slope to Valdez. The pipeline construction also aided the economy of the area. Delta Junction experienced a temporary boom, similar to the gold rush, that resulted in a wave of new residents and businesses in the community. Cost of living during this period was well above the national average due to transportation costs, as well as gouging. Prostitution and bars flourished — as did churches and religious communes.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Tanana Valley was designated as a potential agricultural area for Alaska. The state of Alaska then made large tracts of land available to future farmers for purchase. Significant was establishment of the &quot;Barley Project&quot; east of the city. Plans were made to grow barley, ship it to Valdez via a future rail terminal, and from there ship it overseas to Asia. Though farms were established and a storage facility constructed in Valdez, the railroad never came, essentially resulting in the failure of the project.

Political pressure and growing costs resulted in the project being defunded upon change in governors. Today, these original farms are primarily used as pasture or for hay production though barley, potatoes, carrots, and even wheat are still grown with limited commercial success. With the availability of a nearby meat processing facility (Delta Meat and Sausage Company), many farmers turned to cattle with limited success. In addition, the area is now known for production of exotic meats such as yak, bison, and elk.

In 1971, the George Parks Highway between Anchorage and Fairbanks was completed. This highway followed the railroad route and was a shorter route for motorists traveling between Anchorage and Fairbanks than the Glenn and Richardson Highway route. Many travelers used the new highway, bypassing Delta Junction. In 1977, pipeline construction ended. The Cold War also ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. These events caused a decline in the economy of Delta Junction.

=== Contemporary (1991–present) ===
During the 1990s and 2000s, immigrants from the former Soviet republics came to the area, significantly changing the makeup of the local population. Fort Greely was included on the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) list in 1995. From 1995 to 2002, Fort Greely was gradually re-aligned through a gradual drawdown in both military and civilian personnel. Once BRAC was complete in 2002, Fort Greely remained open but was staffed with fewer than 100 military and civilian personnel. During this time the remaining workers were either associated with public works functions or the Cold Regions Test Center, which continued testing on the installation. Headquarters for both the Cold Regions Test Center and the Northern Warfare Training Center moved to Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks in 2002. Base housing and numerous surplus buildings remained vacant, though the Army continued heating and maintaining them.

Re-alignment of Fort Greely resulted in heated discussion throughout the Delta Junction community over a proposal to site a privately operated state prison within surplus buildings on Fort Greely. Eventually, the city of Delta Junction entered into a contract with Allvest Corporation to operate this prison. Plans for the prison eventually fell through. Allvest Corporation subsequently sued Delta Junction for $1million for breach of contract.

Shortly after BRAC was complete, the United States government announced plans to build a missile defense installation at Fort Greely. The installation was then divided into two parts operated by two different commands — U.S. Army Garrison Alaska and Space and Missile Defense Command. The main post retained the name Fort Greely and is operated by the Space and Missile Defense Command. Outlying range, training and impact areas were absorbed by Fort Wainwright and were renamed Donnelly Training Area.

From 2002 to 2005, Delta Junction experienced an economic boom similar to the pipeline days as Fort Greely became fully operational again and the missile test bed was constructed. National firms such as Boeing, Bechtel, and Brown and Root, as well as regional firms including Chugach opened up offices on the installation, under contract to the government. Construction of the Pogo Gold Mine just north of Delta Junction, near the Goodpaster River, also contributed significantly to the economic fortune of the city. Mineral deposits near Tangle Lakes, south of Delta Junction, will likely result in additional development of mining in the area.

== Geography ==
&quot;Big Delta&quot; lies at the intersection of the Delta River and the Tanana River. The city of Delta Junction sits on the Delta River at the intersection of the Richardson Highway and the terminus of the Alaska Highway. The city and Delta community lie within the fertile Tanana River valley. Three mountain ranges—the White Mountains to the north, the Granite Mountains to the southeast, and the Alaska Range to the southwest—and the Delta River to the west surround the city.

Once overlain by glaciers, the geology is marked by glacial moraines as well as alluvial deposits from the Delta and Tanana Rivers. Numerous mineral deposits are found in the vicinity of Delta Junction ranging from gold to molybdenum to coal. A prominent natural feature on the landscape is Donnelly Dome, located within the Donnelly Training Area of Fort Wainwright (formerly a part of nearby Fort Greely until 2001), to the south of Delta Junction. This dome was formed as a glacier coming from the Alaska Range split in two, carving away sides of a former mountain.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

=== Climate ===

As is typical of the Alaska Interior, Delta Junction has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dwc&quot;), closely bordering on a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;). The average high temperature is below freezing from mid-October thru late March, and during the height of winter cold, as the town is located in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 2a, the coldest conditions of the year typically bottom out in the range, with sub- highs a common occurrence. Precipitation averages at only annually, and over half of this total occurs from June to August.

Snow, which typically falls from October to April and sometimes May and September, is generally not heavy due to the dry climate, and averages per season. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on January 30, 1947, up to on June 15, 1969. Delta Junction has an unofficial record low of set on January 6, 1975 (as seen on the big thermometer in the town center) but the Delta Junction weather station and NOAA refuse to acknowledge this record as legitimate, as such temperatures are atypical for the region and atypical temperature readings are usually inaccurate.

The coldest daily maximum on record from Delta Junction was an extremely cold in January 1975. During an average year between 1991 and 2020, the coldest maximum averaged . Summer nights are seldom warm but nevertheless did not fall below in August 1999 and August 6, 2024. During an average year the warmest low is .

Delta Junction was known as the &quot;Windy City&quot; and &quot;Little Chicago&quot; by many soldiers on Fort Greely. In Delta Junction itself, but not in the nearby areas, wind blows many days from the south down the Delta River from the Gulf of Alaska, bringing river silt in the summer and snowdrifts in the winter. There are usually several days in the winter when the temperature is in the range of −40 °F/°C when a wind (known as a Chinook wind) begins to blow. A few minutes later, the temperature climbs to above the freezing mark. When the wind stops, the temperature returns to colder ranges.

Delta Junction&#x27;s prevailing winds are from the east.
;Notes: 
== Demographics ==

Delta Junction first appeared on the 1970 U.S. Census as an incorporated city.

=== Race and ethnicity ===
As of the census of 2000, there were 840 people, 312 households, and 208 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 422 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 91.43% White, 1.07% Black or African American, 4.05% Native American, 0.95% Asian, 0.12% from other races, and 2.38% from two or more races. 0.83% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Delta Junction has the highest percentage of Ukrainian people in the United States, with 16.4% of residents having been born in Ukraine and an even higher total number having Ukrainian ancestry. According to the 2000 Census, 19.64% of the general population and 31.10% of those aged 5–17 used either Russian or Ukrainian as home language. Delta Junction is home for a sizable community of Russian Orthodox Old Believers.

=== Age and gender ===
Of the 312 households, 35.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52.6% were married couples living together, 9.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.3% were non-families. 28.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.69 and the average family size was 3.32.

In the city, the age distribution of the population shows 32.6% under the age of 18, 6.5% from 18 to 24, 26.5% from 25 to 44, 26.5% from 45 to 64, and 7.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 112.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 109.6 males.

=== Income ===
The median income for a household in the city was $43,500, and the median income for a family was $58,250. Males had a median income of $50,469 versus $25,750 for females. The per capita income for the city was $19,171. About 12.3% of families and 19.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.8% of those under age 18 and 13.2% of those age 65 or over.

== Economy ==
Construction and maintenance of the military facilities, mining, agriculture, tourism and their support industries form the backbone of the area economy. An Alaska Railroad spur from Fairbanks to Delta Junction has been proposed to transport material to the missile defense site. This could facilitate other types of industry in Delta Junction, as the railroad could transport agricultural products out of the area as well as promote tourist travel into the area by rail.

Many people in Delta Junction supplement their food supply by hunting the moose, caribou, Dall sheep and bison in the area, as well as fishing. A few operate small gold mines or hunt or trap fur-bearing animals for extra income. Delta Junction, like most Alaskan communities, has a small airstrip where charter flights are available for sightseeing, hunting and fishing. Due to limited shopping availability, many residents travel to Fairbanks via the Richardson Highway to purchase goods and services. Though Delta has a clinic, primary medical care is also in Fairbanks.

Delta Junction is home to Alaska Range Dairy, the only dairy in Alaska.

== Parks and recreation ==
The area around Delta Junction is home to a number of parks. Just north of the city is the Quartz Lake State Recreation Area. South of the city is the Clearwater State recreation Site, a park with a campground and access to the Delta Clearwater River.

Further south is the Delta State Recreation Site, a park directly across from the Delta River. It has a campground, a nearby airstrip, and views of the Alaska Range. The Donnelly Creek State Recreation Site is an isolated park in an alpine environment. The park has a campground and is considered a prime spot for wildlife viewing and is adjacent to the calving grounds for the bison herd.

In the early 1980s, the Delta Junction Bison Range, south of the Alaska Highway and between Ft. Greely and the Little Gerstle River was established. The range is managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to provide fall habitat for bison to reduce farm depredations and to provide habitat for other wildlife. The herd is now kept at several hundred animals by the annual issuance of hunting permits.

== Education ==
Public education in Delta Junction is provided by the Delta-Greely School District, which combines the city with neighboring communities such as Big Delta, Deltana, Fort Greely Gerstle River School, and Healy Lake. In 2007, Delta Junction Elementary School was named a National Blue Ribbon School.

<text>Eagle ( in Hän Athabascan) is a village on the south bank of the Yukon River, near the Canada–US border in the Southeast Fairbanks Census Area in Alaska, United States. It includes the Eagle Historic District, a U.S. National Historic Landmark. The population was 86 at the 2010 census. Every February, Eagle hosts a checkpoint for the long-distance Yukon Quest sled dog race.

==Geography==
Eagle is located at (64.786022, -141.199917), in a straight line about west of the border between Alaska and the Yukon Territory of Canada at the 141st meridian west.

Eagle is on the southern bank of the Yukon River at the end of the Taylor Highway, near Yukon–Charley Rivers National Preserve.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Climate==
Like most of Alaska, Eagle has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dwc&quot;) with long, severely cold, dry winters occasionally moderated by chinook winds, and short, warm summers. In the absence of chinook moderation, winter temperatures can be dangerously cold: in the notoriously cold month of December 1917, the temperature did not rise above and it averaged . When chinooks occur, winter temperatures can get above , doing so on an average of five days per winter.

==History==
For thousands of years prior to Europeans arriving in Alaska, the Eagle area was home to many indigenous peoples, including the Han.

The first known American-built structure in Eagle was a log trading post called &quot;Belle Isle&quot;, erected around 1874. Subsequently, in the late 1800s, Eagle became a supply and trading center for miners working the upper Yukon River and its tributaries. By the year 1898, Eagle&#x27;s population had exceeded 1,700 persons; many newcomers journeyed to the area with word of the Klondike Gold Rush.

In 1901, Eagle became the first incorporated city of the Alaska Interior. It was named for the many eagles that nested on nearby Eagle Bluff. A United States Army camp, Fort Egbert, was built at Eagle in 1900. A telegraph line between Eagle and Valdez was completed in 1903. In 1905, Roald Amundsen arrived in Eagle and telegraphed the news of the Northwest Passage to the rest of the world.

The ensuing gold rushes in Nome and Fairbanks eventually lured people away from Eagle. In 1903, Judge James Wickersham moved the Third Division court from Eagle to Fairbanks. By 1910, Eagle&#x27;s population had declined to its present-day level, below 200 people. Fort Egbert was abandoned in 1911.

Present-day Eagle is home to (mostly) people of European descent; nearby Eagle Village has a small population that is about 50 percent Han.

The town enjoyed some notoriety, as the setting of John McPhee&#x27;s book &quot;Coming into the Country&quot;, first published in 1977 and becoming quite popular. Many of the buildings from the Gold Rush years are preserved as part of the Eagle Historic District, a National Historic Landmark district.
The Eagle area also is one of the locales featured on the National Geographic Channel series &quot;Life Below Zero&quot;.
==Demographics==
Eagle first appeared on the 1900 U.S. Census as Eagle City, although it was not incorporated until the following year. It was shortened to Eagle in the following census.

==Eagle Historic District==

The Eagle Historic District is a well-preserved example of the historic development in Northern Alaska. Fort Egbert was built in 1889 to serve a central governmental role for the area. Over 100 buildings from this era survive including the Federal courthouse which was funded by fines enacted against the rowdy inhabitants. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 27, 1970 and was designated as a National Historic Landmark on June 2, 1978.

===Army Nuclear Power Program===
Because of its remote location, Fort Greely was chosen as one of the first US military posts to have a compact, nuclear power reactor to generate heat and electricity, under the auspices of the Army Nuclear Power Program. A nuclear power plant, designated the SM-1A was flown in and installed between 1960–62, and was based on the Army&#x27;s first prototype reactor, the SM-1 at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. SM-1A pressurized-water reactor reached initial criticality on March 13, 1962, and was shut down in 1972: the reactor core was removed and sent to the Savannah River nuclear site.

==Demographics==

<text>Tetlin (&quot;Teełąy&quot; in Upper Tanana Athabascan) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Southeast Fairbanks Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 127, up from 117 in 2000.

==Geography==
Tetlin is located at (63.137840, -142.524451).
Tetlin is located along the Tetlin River, between Tetlin Lake and the Tanana River, about southeast of Tok. It lies in the Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge. The village is connected by a dirt road to the Alaska Highway. The community is located in the Fairbanks Recording District.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (2.14%) is water.

==Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge==
Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1980 to conserve and manage habitat critical to migratory and resident wildlife for benefit of present and future generations. The Refuge includes snowcapped mountains and glacier-fed rivers, forests and treeless tundra, and an abundance of wetlands. Tetlin Wildlife Refuge produces up to 1,000,000 ducklings a year, and it is home to 186 or more species of birds. This upper Tanana Valley has been called the &quot;Tetlin Passage&quot; because it serves as a major migratory route for birds traveling to and from Canada, the Lower 48 and both Central and South America. Many of these birds breed and nest in the refuge. Migrants, including ducks, geese, swans, cranes, raptors, and songbirds begin arriving in the valley in early April and continue into early June.

Tetlin also supports a variety of large mammals. Dall Sheep dot the higher slopes while moose feed upon the tender new growth that springs up in the wake of frequent lightning-caused fires. Wolves, grizzly, black bears and many members of three different caribou herds range over the refuge.

Two of the six known humpback whitefish spawning areas of the Yukon River drainage are located within the refuge. Along with caribou and moose, these fish are important subsistence resources for area residents. Arctic Grayling, Northern Pike and burbot are also found in the refuge&#x27;s many streams and lakes.

==History==
The semi-nomadic Athabascan Indians have historically lived in this area, moving with the seasons between several hunting and fishing camps. In 1885, Lt.H.T. Allen found small groups of people living in Tetlin and Last Tetlin, to the south. The residents of Last Tetlin had made numerous to trading posts on the Yukon River. In 1912, the villagers from Tetlin would trade at the Tanana Crossing Trading Post. During the Chisana gold stampede in 1913, a trading post was established across the river from Tetlin. When two trading posts were opened in the village during the 1920s by John Hajdukovich and W.H. Newton, residents from Last Tetlin relocated to Tetlin. A school was constructed in 1929, and a post office was opened in 1932. The Tetlin Indian Reserve was established in 1930. An airstrip was constructed in 1946. When the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act(ANCSA) was passed in 1971, the reserve was revoked. Tetlin opted for surface and subsurface title to the of land in the former Reserve.

==Demographics==

Tetlin first appeared on the 1940 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It was made a census-designated place (CDP) in 1980.

== History ==
There have been Athabascan settlements in the region of what is now Tok for many centuries.

The town at the present location of Tok began in 1942 as an Alaska Road Commission camp used for construction and maintenance of the Alaska Highway. So much money was spent in the camp&#x27;s construction and maintenance that it earned the nickname &quot;Million Dollar Camp&quot; from those working on the highway. In 1947 the first school opened, and in 1958 a larger school was built to accommodate the many newcomers. In 1995 a new school was opened to provide for the larger community. A U.S. Customs Office was located in Tok between 1947 and 1971, when it was moved to the Canada–US border.

Between 1954 and 1979, an 8-inch U.S. Army fuel pipeline operated from the port of Haines to Fairbanks, with a pump station in Tok.

In July 1990 Tok faced extinction when a lightning-caused forest fire jumped two rivers and the Alaska Highway, putting both residents and buildings in peril. The town was evacuated and even the efforts of over a thousand firefighters could not stop the fire. At the last minute a &quot;miracle wind&quot; (so labeled by Tok&#x27;s residents) came up, diverting the fire just short of the first building. The fire continued to burn the remainder of the summer, eventually burning more than .

On January 10, 2009, Tok made headlines with an unconfirmed temperature reading of .

=== Etymology ===
In one version, the name Tok is derived from the Athabascan word for &quot;peaceful crossing.&quot; The U.S. Geological Survey notes that the name &quot;Tok River&quot; was in use for the nearby river around 1901, and the Athabascan name of &quot;Tokai&quot; had been reported for the same river by Lt. Allen in 1887. In another version the name is derived from the English words &quot;Tokyo camp&quot;, although the major war benefit was supporting the transfer of airplanes to the Soviet Union. Another version claims the name was derived from the canine mascot for one of the Engineer units that built the highways. The name has no connection to the western Alaskan community of Newtok.

Another version comes from the proposed road construction of the highway to Richardson Highway. In the 1940s and 1950s, another highway, the Tok Cut-Off was constructed and connected Tok with the Richardson Highway at Glennallen. It was a &quot;cut-off&quot; because it allowed motor travelers from the lower United States to travel to Valdez and Anchorage in south-central Alaska without going further north to Delta Junction and then traveling south on the Richardson Highway. When originally being surveyed from the air, the map marking showed the &quot;T&quot; intersection, and the letters &quot;OK&quot; to confirm the location was suitable.

==Education==
Tok is part of the Alaska Gateway School District. Tok School, a K–12 campus, currently serves approximately 200 community students.
There is also a small University of Alaska office that provides distance and even some local classes for the small community.

==Health care==
Residents are primarily served by the Tok Clinic and EMS. Roads connect Tok to both Fairbanks and Anchorage (Alaska&#x27;s two most populous cities), but the drive is approximately 3 hours 40 minutes or 6 hours 30 minutes, respectively. Therefore, once patients with serious medical conditions are stabilized, they are often airlifted to a hospital/medical center in Fairbanks (an approximately 1 hour 30 minute flight) if further treatment is needed.

== Economy ==
The most common occupations in Tok are in the construction, healthcare, and accommodation industries. The unemployment rate is 8%. Tok&#x27;s economy is supported largely by tourism.

==Protected areas==
There are a number of state parks in the vicinity of Tok.

The Tok River State Recreation Site is a small, park, east of Tok; it has a small campground, trails, and river access for small boats. The area directly across the river from the park is part of the burned-over area still recovering from the 1990 wildfire.

The Eagle Trail State Recreation Site is a park, about south of Tok, on the Tok Cutoff. The park has a campground and picnic areas, hiking trails, access to the historic Valdez-Eagle Trail and the high country of the Alaska Range.

The Moon Lake State Recreation Site is a small, park off the Alaska Highway, 15 miles northwest of Tok. It has a small campground, beach, boat launch for smaller boats, and is an active landing spot for floatplanes.

<text>William Sealy Gosset (13 June 1876 – 16 October 1937) was an English statistician, chemist and brewer who served as Head Brewer of Guinness and Head Experimental Brewer of Guinness and was a pioneer of modern statistics. He pioneered small sample experimental design and analysis with an economic approach to the logic of uncertainty. Gosset published under the pen name Student and developed most famously Student&#x27;s t-distribution – originally called Student&#x27;s &quot;z&quot; – and &quot;Student&#x27;s test of statistical significance&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Born in Canterbury, England the eldest son of Agnes Sealy Vidal and Colonel Frederic Gosset, R.E. Royal Engineers, Gosset attended Winchester College before matriculating as Winchester Scholar in natural sciences and mathematics at New College, Oxford. Upon graduating in 1899, he joined the brewery of Arthur Guinness &amp; Son in Dublin, Ireland; he spent the rest of his 38-year career at Guinness.

Gosset had three children with Marjory Gosset (née Phillpotts). Harry Gosset (1907–1965) was a consultant paediatrician; Bertha Marian Gosset (1909–2004) was a geographer and nurse; the youngest, Ruth Gosset (1911–1953) married the Oxford mathematician Douglas Roaf and had five children.

In his job as Head Experimental Brewer at Guinness, Gosset developed new statistical methods – both in the brewery and on the farm – now central to the design of experiments, to proper use of significance testing on repeated trials, and to analysis of economic significance (an early instance of decision theory interpretation of statistics) and more, such as his small-sample, stratified, and repeated balanced experiments on barley for proving the best yielding varieties. Gosset acquired that knowledge by study, by trial and error, by cooperating with others, and by spending two terms in 1906–1907 in the Biometrics laboratory of Karl Pearson. Gosset and Pearson had a good relationship. Pearson helped Gosset with the mathematics of his papers, including the 1908 papers, but had little appreciation of their importance. The papers addressed the brewer&#x27;s concern with small samples; biometricians like Pearson, on the other hand, typically had hundreds of observations and saw no urgency in developing small-sample methods.

Gosset&#x27;s first publication came in 1907, &quot;On the Error of Counting with a Haemocytometer,&quot; in which – unbeknownst to Gosset aka &quot;Student&quot; – he rediscovered the Poisson distribution. Another researcher at Guinness had previously published a paper containing trade secrets of the Guinness brewery. The economic historian Stephen Ziliak discovered in the Guinness Archives that to prevent further disclosure of confidential information, the Guinness Board of Directors allowed its scientists to publish research on condition that they do not mention &quot;1) beer, 2) Guinness, or 3) their own surname&quot;. To Ziliak, Gosset seems to have gotten his pen name &quot;Student&quot; from his 1906–1907 notebook on counting yeast cells with a haemocytometer, &quot;The Student&#x27;s Science Notebook&quot; Thus his most noteworthy achievement is now called Student&#x27;s, rather than Gosset&#x27;s, t-distribution and test of statistical significance.

Gosset published most of his 21 academic papers, including &quot;The probable error of a mean,&quot; in Pearson&#x27;s journal &quot;Biometrika&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Student&quot;. It was, however, not Pearson but Ronald A. Fisher who appreciated the understudied importance of Gosset&#x27;s small-sample work. Fisher wrote to Gosset in 1912 explaining that Student&#x27;s z-distribution should be divided by degrees of freedom not total sample size. From 1912 to 1934 Gosset and Fisher would exchange more than 150 letters. In 1924, Gosset wrote in a letter to Fisher, &quot;I am sending you a copy of Student&#x27;s Tables as you are the only man that&#x27;s ever likely to use them!&quot; Fisher believed that Gosset had effected a &quot;logical revolution&quot;. In a special issue of &quot;Metron&quot; in 1925 Student published the corrected tables, now called Student&#x27;s t formula_1. In the same volume Fisher contributed applications of Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution to regression analysis.

Although introduced by others, Studentized residuals are named in Student&#x27;s honour because, like the problem that led to Student&#x27;s t-distribution, the idea of adjusting for estimated standard deviations is central to that concept.

Gosset&#x27;s interest in the cultivation of barley led him to speculate that the design of experiments should aim not only at improving the average yield but also at breeding varieties whose yield was insensitive to variation in soil and climate (that is, &quot;robust&quot;). Gosset called his innovation &quot;balanced layout&quot;, because treatments and controls are allocated in a balanced fashion to stratified growing conditions, such as differential soil fertility. Gosset&#x27;s balanced principle was challenged by Ronald Fisher, who preferred randomized designs. The Bayesian Harold Jeffreys, and Gosset&#x27;s close associates Jerzy Neyman and Egon S. Pearson sided with Gosset&#x27;s balanced designs of experiments; however, as Ziliak (2014) has shown, Gosset and Fisher would strongly disagree for the rest of their lives about the meaning and interpretation of balanced versus randomized experiments, as they had earlier clashed on the role of bright-line rules of statistical significance.

In 1935, at the age of 59, Gosset left Dublin to take up the position of Head Brewer at a new (and second) Guinness brewery at Park Royal in northwestern London. In September 1937 Gosset was promoted to Head Brewer of all Guinness. He died one month later, aged 61, in Beaconsfield, England, of a heart attack.

Gosset was a friend of both Pearson and Fisher, a noteworthy achievement, for each had a massive ego and a loathing for the other. He was a modest man who once cut short an admirer with this comment: &quot;Fisher would have discovered it all anyway.&quot;
