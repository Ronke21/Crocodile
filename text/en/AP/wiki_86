<text>A dietary supplement is a manufactured product intended to supplement a person&#x27;s diet by taking a pill, capsule, tablet, powder, or liquid. A supplement can provide nutrients either extracted from food sources, or that are synthetic (in order to increase the quantity of their consumption). The classes of nutrient compounds in supplements include vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids, and amino acids. Dietary supplements can also contain substances that have not been confirmed as being essential to life, and so are not &quot;nutrients&quot; per se, but are marketed as having a beneficial biological effect, such as plant pigments or polyphenols. Animals can also be a source of supplement ingredients, such as collagen from chickens or fish for example. These are also sold individually and in combination, and may be combined with nutrient ingredients. The European Commission has also established harmonized rules to help insure that food supplements are safe and appropriately labeled.
Creating an industry estimated to have a value of $151.9 billion in 2021, there are more than 50,000 dietary supplement products marketed in the United States, where about 50% of the American adult population consumes dietary supplements. Multivitamins are the most commonly used product among types of dietary supplements. The United States National Institutes of Health states that supplements &quot;may be of value&quot; for those who are nutrient deficient from their diet and receive approval from their medical provider.
In the United States, it is against federal regulations for supplement manufacturers to claim that these products prevent or treat any disease. Companies are allowed to use what is referred to as &quot;Structure/Function&quot; wording if there is substantiation of scientific evidence for a supplement providing a potential health effect. An example would be &quot;_____ helps maintain healthy joints&quot;, but the label must bear a disclaimer that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) &quot;has not evaluated the claim&quot; and that the dietary supplement product is not intended to &quot;diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease&quot;, because only a drug can legally make such a claim. The FDA enforces these regulations and also prohibits the sale of supplements and supplement ingredients that are dangerous, or supplements not made according to standardized good manufacturing practices (GMPs).

==Definition==
In the United States, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 provides this description: &quot;The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) defines the term &quot;dietary supplement&quot; to mean a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other botanical, an amino acid, a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the aforementioned ingredients. Furthermore, a dietary supplement must be labeled as a dietary supplement and be intended for ingestion and must not be represented for use as conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or of the diet. In addition, a dietary supplement cannot be approved or authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biologic, unless it was marketed as a food or a dietary supplement before such approval or authorization. Under DSHEA, dietary supplements are deemed to be food, except for purposes of the drug definition.&quot;

Per DSHEA, dietary supplements are consumed orally, and are mainly defined by what they are not: conventional foods (including meal replacements), medical foods, preservatives or pharmaceutical drugs. Products intended for use as a nasal spray, or topically, as a lotion applied to the skin, do not qualify. FDA-approved drugs cannot be ingredients in dietary supplements. Supplement products are or contain vitamins, nutritionally essential minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids and non-nutrient substances extracted from plants or animals or fungi or bacteria, or in the instance of probiotics, are live bacteria. Dietary supplement ingredients may also be synthetic copies of naturally occurring substances (for example: melatonin). All products with these ingredients are required to be labeled as dietary supplements. Like foods and unlike drugs, no government approval is required to make or sell dietary supplements; the manufacturer confirms the safety of dietary supplements but the government does not; and rather than requiring risk–benefit analysis to prove that the product can be sold like a drug, such assessment is only used by the FDA to decide that a dietary supplement is unsafe and should be removed from market.

==Types==

===Vitamins===

A vitamin is an organic compound required by an organism as a vital nutrient in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is called a vitamin when it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism and must be obtained from the diet. The term is conditional both on the circumstances and on the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is a vitamin for anthropoid primates, humans, guinea pigs and bats, but not for other mammals. Vitamin D is not an essential nutrient for people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, as they synthesize vitamin D in skin. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules, &quot;vitamers&quot;, (e.g. vitamin E includes tocopherols and tocotrienols, vitamin K includes vitamin K1 and K2). The list: vitamins A, C, D, E, K, Thiamine (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacin (B3), Pantothenic Acid (B5), Vitamin B6, Biotin (B7), Folate (B9) and Vitamin B12. Vitamin intake below recommended amounts can result in signs and symptoms associated with vitamin deficiency. There is little evidence of benefit when vitamins are consumed as a dietary supplement by those who are healthy and have a nutritionally adequate diet.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for some of the vitamins. This does not prevent dietary supplement companies from selling products with content per serving higher than the ULs. For example, the UL for vitamin D is 100 μg (4,000 IU), but products are available without prescription at 10,000 IU.

===Minerals===
Minerals are the exogenous chemical elements indispensable for life. Four minerals – carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen – are essential for life but are so ubiquitous in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. Sulfur is essential, but for humans, not identified as having a recommended intake per se. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine. There are dietary supplements that provide sulfur, such as taurine and methylsulfonylmethane.

The essential nutrient minerals for humans, listed in order by weight needed to be at the Recommended Dietary Allowance or Adequate Intake are potassium, chlorine, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, iodine, chromium, molybdenum, selenium and cobalt (the last as a component of vitamin B12). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as boron and silicon. Essential and purportedly essential minerals are marketed as dietary supplements, individually and in combination with vitamins and other minerals.

Although as a general rule, dietary supplement labeling and marketing are not allowed to make disease prevention or treatment claims, the U.S. FDA has for some foods and dietary supplements reviewed the science, concluded that there is significant scientific agreement, and published specifically worded allowed health claims. An initial ruling allowing a health claim for calcium dietary supplements and osteoporosis was later amended to include calcium supplements with or without vitamin D, effective January 1, 2010. Examples of allowed wording are shown below. In order to qualify for the calcium health claim, a dietary supplement must contain at least 20% of the Reference Dietary Intake, which for calcium means at least 260 mg/serving.

* &quot;Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.&quot;
* &quot;Adequate calcium as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life.&quot;
* &quot;Adequate calcium and vitamin D throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.&quot;
* &quot;Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life.&quot;

In the same year, the European Food Safety Authority also approved a dietary supplement health claim for calcium and vitamin D and the reduction of the risk of osteoporotic fractures by reducing bone loss.
The U.S. FDA also approved Qualified Health Claims (QHCs) for various health conditions for calcium, selenium and chromium picolinate. QHCs are supported by scientific evidence, but do not meet the more rigorous &quot;significant scientific agreement&quot; standard required for an authorized health claim. If dietary supplement companies choose to make such a claim then the FDA stipulates the exact wording of the QHC to be used on labels and in marketing materials. The wording can be onerous: &quot;One study suggests that selenium intake may reduce the risk of bladder cancer in women. However, one smaller study showed no reduction in risk. Based on these studies, FDA concludes that it is highly uncertain that selenium supplements reduce the risk of bladder cancer in women.&quot;

===Proteins and amino acids===
Protein-containing supplements, either ready-to-drink or as powders to be mixed into water, are marketed as aids to people recovering from illness or injury, those hoping to thwart the sarcopenia of old age, to athletes who believe that strenuous physical activity increases protein requirements, to people hoping to lose weight while minimizing muscle loss, i.e., conducting a protein-sparing modified fast, and to people who want to increase muscle size for performance and appearance. Whey protein is a popular ingredient, but products may also incorporate casein, soy, pea, hemp or rice protein. A meta-analysis found a moderate degree of evidence in favor of whey protein supplements use as a safe and effective adjunct to an athlete&#x27;s training and recovery, including benefits for endurance, average power, muscle mass, and reduced perceived exercise intensity.

According to US and Canadian Dietary Reference Intake guidelines, the protein Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults is based on 0.8 grams protein per kilogram body weight. The recommendation is for sedentary and lightly active people. Scientific reviews can conclude that a high protein diet, when combined with exercise, will increase muscle mass and strength, or conclude the opposite. The International Olympic Committee recommends protein intake targets for both strength and endurance athletes at about 1.2–1.8 g/kg body mass per day. One review proposed a maximum daily protein intake of approximately 25% of energy requirements, i.e., approximately 2.0 to 2.5 g/kg.

The same protein ingredients marketed as dietary supplements can be incorporated into meal replacement and medical food products, but those are regulated and labeled differently from supplements. In the United States, &quot;meal replacement&quot; products are foods and are labeled as such. These typically contain protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals. There may be content claims such as &quot;good source of protein&quot;, &quot;low fat&quot; or &quot;lactose free&quot;. Medical foods, also nutritionally complete, are designed to be used while a person is under the care of a physician or other licensed healthcare professional. Liquid medical food products – for example, Ensure – are available in regular and high protein versions.

Proteins are chains of amino acids. Nine of these proteinogenic amino acids are considered essential for humans because they cannot be produced from other compounds by the human body and so must be taken in as food. Recommended intakes, expressed as milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day, have been established. Other amino acids may be conditionally essential for certain ages or medical conditions. Amino acids, individually and in combinations, are sold as dietary supplements. The claim for supplementing with the branched-chain amino acids leucine, valine and isoleucine is for stimulating muscle protein synthesis. A review of the literature concluded this claim was unwarranted. In elderly people, supplementation with just leucine resulted in a modest (0.99 kg) increase in lean body mass. The non-essential amino acid arginine, consumed in sufficient amounts, is thought to act as a donor for the synthesis of nitric oxide, a vasodilator. A review confirmed blood pressure lowering. Taurine, a popular dietary supplement ingredient with claims made for sports performance, is technically not an amino acid. It is synthesized in the body from the amino acid cysteine.

===Bodybuilding supplements===
===Essential fatty acids===

Fish oil is a commonly used fatty acid supplement because it is a source of omega-3 fatty acids. Fatty acids are strings of carbon atoms, having a range of lengths. If links are all single (C−C), then the fatty acid is called &quot;saturated&quot;; with one double bond (C=C), it is called &quot;monounsaturated&quot;; if there are two or more double bonds (C=C=C), it is called &quot;polyunsaturated&quot;. Only two fatty acids, both polyunsaturated, are considered essential to be obtained from the diet, as the others are synthesized in the body. The &quot;essential&quot; fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, and linoleic acid (LA), an omega-6 fatty acid. ALA can be elongated in the body to create other omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

Plant oils, particularly seed and nut oils, contain ALA. Food sources of EPA and DHA are oceanic fish, whereas dietary supplement sources include fish oil, krill oil and marine algae extracts. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identifies 250 mg/day for a combined total of EPA and DHA as Adequate Intake, with a recommendation that women pregnant or lactating consume an additional 100 to 200 mg/day of DHA. In the United States and Canada are Adequate Intakes for ALA and LA over various stages of life, but there are no intake levels specified for EPA and/or DHA.

Supplementation with EPA and/or DHA does not appear to affect the risk of death, cancer or heart disease. Furthermore, studies of fish oil supplements have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes. In 2017, the American Heart Association issued a science advisory stating that it could not recommend use of omega-3 fish oil supplements for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease or stroke, although it reaffirmed supplementation for people who have a history of coronary heart disease.

Manufacturers have begun to include long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA and arachidonic acid (AA) into their formula milk for newborns, however, a 2017 review found that supplementation with DHA and AA does not appear to be harmful or beneficial to formula-fed infants.

===Natural products===


Dietary supplements can be manufactured using intact sources or extracts from plants, animals, algae, fungi or lichens, including such examples as ginkgo biloba, curcumin, cranberry, St. John&#x27;s wort, ginseng, resveratrol, glucosamine and collagen. Products bearing promotional claims of health benefits are sold without requiring a prescription in pharmacies, supermarkets, specialist shops, military commissaries, buyers clubs, direct selling organizations, and the internet. While most of these products have a long history of use in herbalism and various forms of traditional medicine, concerns exist about their actual efficacy, safety and consistency of quality. Canada has published a manufacturer and consumer guide describing quality, licensing, standards, identities, and common contaminants of natural products.

In 2019, sales of herbal supplements just in the United States alone were $9.6 billion, with the market growing at approximately 8.6% per year, with cannabidiol and mushroom product sales as the highest. Italy, Germany, and Eastern European countries were leading consumers of botanical supplements in 2016, with European Union market growth forecast to be $8.7 billion by 2020.

===Probiotics===

Claimed benefits of using probiotic supplements are not supported by sufficient clinical evidence. Meta-analysis studies have reported a modest reduction of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and acute diarrhea in children taking probiotics. There is limited evidence in support of adults using mono-strain and multi-strain containing probiotics for the alleviation of symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Probiotic supplements are generally regarded as safe.

=== Fertility ===

A meta-analysis provided preliminary evidence that men treated with supplements containing selenium, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10 or carnitines reported improvements in total sperm count, concentration, motility, and morphology. A review concluded that omega-3 taken through supplements and diet might improve semen quality in infertile men. A 2021 review also supported selenium, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10 or carnitines, but warned that &quot;excessive use of antioxidants may be detrimental to the spermatic function and many of the over-the-counter supplements are not scientifically proven to improve fertility.&quot;

There is low quality and insufficient evidence for the use of oral antioxidant supplements as a viable treatment for subfertile woman. A review provided evidence that taking dehydroepiandrosterone before starting an &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization series may increase pregnancy rates and decrease miscarriage likelihood.

=== Prenatal ===

Prenatal vitamins are dietary supplements commonly given to pregnant women to supply nutrients that may reduce health complications for the mother and fetus. Although prenatal vitamins are not meant to substitute for dietary nutrition, prenatal supplementation may be beneficial for pregnant women at risk of nutrient deficiencies because of diet limitations or restrictions. The most common components in prenatal vitamins include vitamins B6, folate, B12, C, D, E, iron and calcium.

Sufficient intake of vitamin B6 can lower the risk of early pregnancy loss and relieve symptoms of morning sickness. Folate is also an essential nutrient for pregnant women to prevent neural tube defects. In 2006, the World Health Organization endorsed the recommendation for women of child-bearing age to consume 400 micrograms of folate through the diet daily if planning a pregnancy. A 2013 review found folic acid supplementation during pregnancy did not affect the mother&#x27;s health other than a risk reduction on low pre-delivery serum folate and megaloblastic anemia. There is little evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplementation improves prenatal outcomes in hypertensive disorders and gestational diabetes. Evidence does not support the routine use of vitamin E supplementation during pregnancy to prevent adverse events, such as preterm birth, fetal or neonatal death, or maternal hypertensive disorders.

Iron supplementation can lower the risk of iron deficiency anemia for pregnant women. In 2020, the World Health Organization updated recommendations for adequate calcium levels during pregnancy to prevent hypertensive disorders.

=== Pharmacotherapy ===
Individuals with hypokalemic sensory overstimulation are sometimes diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), raising the possibility that a subtype of ADHD has a cause that can be understood mechanistically and treated in a novel way. The sensory overload is treatable with oral potassium gluconate.

==Industry==
In 2020, the American market for dietary supplements was valued at $140.3 billion, with the economic impact in the United States for 2016 estimated at $122 billion, including employment wages and taxes. A 2020 analysis projected that the global market for vitamins and dietary supplement products would reach $196.6 billion by 2028, where the growth in market size is largely attributed to recent technological advancements in product manufacturing, increased demand for products advertised as healthy, increased product availability, and population aging.

==Adulteration, contamination and mislabeling==
Over the period 2008 to 2011, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) of the United States received 6,307 reports of health problems (identified as adverse events) from use of dietary supplements containing a combination of ingredients in manufactured vitamins, minerals or other supplement products, with 92% of tested herbal supplements containing lead and 80% containing other chemical contaminants. Using undercover staff, the GAO also found that supplement retailers intentionally engaged in &quot;unequivocal deception&quot; to sell products advertised with baseless health claims, particularly to elderly consumers. Consumer Reports also reported unsafe levels of arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury in several protein powder products. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that protein spiking, i.e., the addition of amino acids to manipulate protein content analysis, was common. Many of the companies involved challenged CBC&#x27;s claim.

In some botanical products, undeclared ingredients were used to increase the bulk of the product and reduce its cost of manufacturing, while potentially violating certain religious and/or cultural limitations on consuming animal ingredients, such as cow, buffalo or deer. In 2015, the New York Attorney General (NY-AG) identified four major retailers with dietary supplement products that contained fraudulent and potentially dangerous ingredients, requiring the companies to remove the products from retail stores. According to the NY-AG, only about 20% of the herbal supplements tested contained the plants claimed. The methodology used by the NY-AG was disputed. The test involves looking for DNA fragments from the plants named as the dietary supplement ingredients in the products. One scientist said that it was possible that the extraction process used to create the supplements removed or destroyed all DNA. This, however, would not explain the presence of DNA from plants such as rice or wheat, that were not listed as ingredients.

A study of dietary supplements sold between 2007 and 2016 identified 776 that contained unlisted pharmaceutical drugs, many of which could interact with other medications and lead to hospitalization. 86% of the adulterated supplements were marketed for weight loss and sexual performance, with many containing prescription erectile dysfunction medication. Muscle building supplements were contaminated with anabolic steroids that can lead to health complications affecting the kidney, the heart, and cause gynecomastia. Multiple bodybuilding products also contained antidepressants and antihistamines. Despite these findings, fewer than half of the adulterated supplements were recalled.

==Regulatory compliance==
The European Commission has published harmonized rules on supplement products to assure consumers have minimal health risks from using dietary supplements and are not misled by advertising.

In the United States and Canada, dietary supplements are considered a subset of foods, and are regulated accordingly. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monitors supplement products for accuracy in advertising and labeling. Dietary supplements are regulated by the FDA as food products subject to compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) and labeling with science-based ingredient descriptions and advertising. When finding CGMP or advertising violations, FDA warning letters are used to notify manufacturers of impending enforcement action, including search and seizure, injunction, and financial penalties. Examples between 2016 and 2018 of CGMP and advertising violations by dietary supplement manufacturers included several with illegal compositions or advertising of vitamins and minerals.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which litigates against deceptive advertising in marketed products, established a consumer center to assist reports of false health claims in product advertising for dietary supplements. In 2017, the FTC successfully sued nine manufacturers for deceptive advertising of dietary supplements.

==Adverse effects==
In the United States, manufacturers of dietary supplements are required to demonstrate safety of their products before approval is granted for commerce. Despite this caution, numerous adverse effects have been reported, including muscle cramps, hair loss, joint pain, liver disease, and allergic reactions, with 29% of the adverse effects resulting in hospitalization, and 20% in serious injuries or illnesses. The potential for adverse effects also occurs when individuals consume more than the necessary daily amount of vitamins or minerals that are needed to maintain normal body processes and functions. The incidence of adverse effects reported to the FDA were due to &quot;combination products&quot; that contain multiple ingredients, whereas dietary supplements containing a single vitamin, mineral, lipid product, and herbal product were less likely to cause adverse effects related to excess supplementation.

Among general reasons for the possible harmful effects of dietary supplements are: a) absorption in a short time, b) manufacturing quality and contamination, and c) enhancing both positive and negative effects at the same time. The incidence of liver injury from herbal and dietary supplements is about 16–20% of all supplement products causing injury, with the occurrence growing globally over the early 21st century. The most common liver injuries from weight loss and bodybuilding supplements involve hepatocellular damage with resulting jaundice, and the most common supplement ingredients attributed to these injuries are green tea catechins, anabolic steroids, and the herbal extract, aegeline. Weight loss supplements have also had adverse psychiatric effects. Some dietary supplements may also have adverse interactions with prescription medications that may enhance side effects or decrease therapeutic effects of medications.

==Society and culture==

===Public health===
Work done by scientists in the early 20th century on identifying individual nutrients in food and developing ways to manufacture them raised hopes that optimal health could be achieved and diseases prevented by adding them to food and providing people with dietary supplements; while there were successes in preventing vitamin deficiencies, and preventing conditions like neural tube defects by supplementation and food fortification with folic acid, no targeted supplementation or fortification strategies to prevent major diseases like cancer or cardiovascular diseases have proved successful.

For example, while increased consumption of fruits and vegetables are related to decreases in mortality, cardiovascular diseases and cancers, supplementation with key factors found in fruits and vegetable, like antioxidants, vitamins, or minerals, do not help and some have been found to be harmful in some cases. In general, as of 2016, robust clinical data is lacking, that shows that any kind of dietary supplementation does more good than harm for people who are healthy and eating a reasonable diet but there is clear data showing that dietary pattern and lifestyle choices are associated with health outcomes.

As a result of the lack of good data for supplementation and the strong data for dietary pattern, public health recommendations for healthy eating urge people to eat a plant-based diet of whole foods, minimizing ultra-processed food, salt and sugar and to get exercise daily, and to abandon Western pattern diets and a sedentary lifestyle.

===Legal regulation===

====United States====

The regulation of food and dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is governed by various statutes enacted by the United States Congress. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and accompanying legislation, the FDA has authority to oversee the quality of substances sold as food in the United States, and to monitor claims made in the labeling about both the composition and the health benefits of foods.

Substances which the FDA regulates as food are subdivided into various categories, including foods, food additives, added substances (man-made substances which are not intentionally introduced into food, but nevertheless end up in it), and dietary supplements. The specific standards which the FDA exercises differ from one category to the next. Furthermore, the FDA has been granted a variety of means by which it can address violations of the standards for a given category of substances.

Dietary supplement manufacture is required to comply with the good manufacturing practices established in 2007. The FDA can visit manufacturing facilities, send Warning Letters if not in compliance with GMPs, stop production, and if there is a health risk, require that the company conduct a recall. Only after a dietary supplement product is marketed, may the FDA&#x27;s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) review the products for safety and effectiveness.

====European Union====
The European Union&#x27;s (EU) Food Supplements Directive of 2002 requires that supplements be demonstrated to be safe, both in dosages and in purity. Only those supplements that have been proven to be safe may be sold in the EU without prescription. As a category of food, food supplements cannot be labeled with drug claims but can bear health claims and nutrition claims.

The dietary supplements industry in the United Kingdom (UK), one of the 28 countries in the bloc, strongly opposed the Directive. In addition, a large number of consumers throughout Europe, including over one million in the UK, and various doctors and scientists, had signed petitions by 2005 against what are viewed by the petitioners as unjustified restrictions of consumer choice. In 2004, along with two British trade associations, the Alliance for Natural Health (ANH) had a legal challenge to the Food Supplements Directive referred to the European Court of Justice by the High Court in London.

Although the European Court of Justice&#x27;s Advocate General subsequently said that the bloc&#x27;s plan to tighten rules on the sale of vitamins and food supplements should be scrapped, he was eventually overruled by the European Court, which decided that the measures in question were necessary and appropriate for the purpose of protecting public health. ANH, however, interpreted the ban as applying only to synthetically produced supplements, and not to vitamins and minerals normally found in or consumed as part of the diet. Nevertheless, the European judges acknowledged the Advocate General&#x27;s concerns, stating that there must be clear procedures to allow substances to be added to the permitted list based on scientific evidence. They also said that any refusal to add the product to the list must be open to challenge in the courts.

===Fraudulent products during the COVID-19 outbreak===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the FDA and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned consumers about marketing scams of fraudulent supplement products, including homeopathic remedies, cannabidiol products, teas, essential oils, tinctures and colloidal silver, among others. By August 2020, the FDA and FTC had issued warning letters to dozens of companies advertising scam products, which were purported &quot;to be drugs, medical devices or vaccines. Products that claim to cure, mitigate, treat, diagnose or prevent disease, but are not proven safe and effective for those purposes, defraud consumers of money and can place consumers at risk for serious harm&quot;

==Research==
Examples of ongoing government research organizations to better understand the potential health properties and safety of dietary supplements are the European Food Safety Authority, the Office of Dietary Supplements of the United States National Institutes of Health, the Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate of Canada, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia. Together with public and private research groups, these agencies construct databases on supplement properties, perform research on quality, safety, and population trends of supplement use, and evaluate the potential clinical efficacy of supplements for maintaining health or lowering disease risk.

===Databases===
As continual research on the properties of supplements accumulates, databases or fact sheets for various supplements are updated regularly, including the Dietary Supplement Label Database, Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database, and Dietary Supplement Facts Sheets of the United States. In Canada where a license is issued when a supplement product has been proven by the manufacturer and government to be safe, effective and of sufficient quality for its recommended use, an eight-digit Natural Product Number is assigned and recorded in a Licensed Natural Health Products Database. The European Food Safety Authority maintains a compendium of botanical ingredients used in manufacturing of dietary supplements.

In 2015, the Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Health published the results of a review of herbal supplements to determine if any were suitable for coverage by health insurance. Establishing guidelines to assess safety and efficacy of botanical supplement products, the European Medicines Agency provided criteria for evaluating and grading the quality of clinical research in preparing monographs about herbal supplements. In the United States, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health of the National Institutes of Health provides fact sheets evaluating the safety, potential effectiveness and side effects of many botanical products.

===Quality and safety===
To assure supplements have sufficient quality, standardization, and safety for public consumption, research efforts have focused on development of reference materials for supplement manufacturing and monitoring. High-dose products have received research attention, especially for emergency situations such as vitamin A deficiency in malnutrition of children, and for women taking folate supplements to reduce the risk of breast cancer.

===Population monitoring===
In the United States, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) has investigated habits of using dietary supplements in context of total nutrient intakes from the diet in adults and children. Over the period of 1999 to 2012, use of multivitamins decreased, and there was wide variability in the use of individual supplements among subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational status. Particular attention has been given to use of folate supplements by young women to reduce the risk of fetal neural tube defects.

===Clinical studies===
Limited human research has been conducted on the potential for dietary supplementation to affect disease risk. Examples:
* vitamin D acute respiratory tract infections
* iron maternal iron deficiency anemia and adverse effects on the fetus
* multiple supplements no evidence of benefit to lower risk of death, cardiovascular diseases or cancer
* magnesium supplementation in reducing all-cause and cancer mortality, as well as improving glucose parameters in people with diabetes and insulin-sensitivity parameters in those at high risk of diabetes.
* folate alone or with B vitamins stroke

A 2017 academic review indicated a rising incidence of liver injury from use of herbal and dietary supplements, particularly those with steroids, green tea extract, or multiple ingredients.

===Absence of benefit===
The potential benefit of using essential nutrient dietary supplements to lower the risk of diseases has been refuted by findings of no effect or weak evidence in numerous clinical reviews, such as for HIV, or tuberculosis.

===Reporting bias===
A review of clinical trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov, which would include both drugs and supplements, reported that nearly half of completed trials were sponsored wholly or partially by industry. This does not automatically imply bias, but there is evidence that because of selective non-reporting, results in support of a potential drug or supplement ingredient are more likely to be published than results that do not demonstrate a statistically significant benefit. One review reported that fewer than half of the registered clinical trials resulted in publication in peer-reviewed journals.

===Future===
Improving public information about use of dietary supplements involves investments in professional training programs, further studies of population and nutrient needs, expanding the database information, enhancing collaborations between governments and universities, and translating dietary supplement research into useful information for consumers, health professionals, scientists, and policymakers. Future demonstration of efficacy from use of dietary supplements requires high-quality clinical research using rigorously qualified products and compliance with established guidelines for reporting of clinical trial results (e.g., CONSORT guidelines).

<text>Anna Mary Robertson Moses (September 7, 1860 – December 13, 1961), or Grandma Moses, was an American folk artist. She began painting in earnest at the age of 78 and is a prominent example of a newly successful art career at an advanced age. Moses gained popularity during the 1950s, having been featured on a cover of &quot;Time Magazine&quot; in 1953. She was a subject of numerous television programs and of a 1950 Oscar-nominated biographical documentary. Her autobiography, titled &quot;My Life&#x27;s History&quot;, was published in 1952. She was also awarded two honorary doctoral degrees.

Moses was a live-in housekeeper for a total of 15 years, starting at age 12. An employer noticed her appreciation for their prints made by Currier and Ives, and they supplied her with drawing materials. Moses and her husband began their married life in Virginia, where they worked on farms. In 1905, they returned to the Northeastern United States and settled in Eagle Bridge, New York. They had ten children, five of whom survived infancy. She embroidered pictures with yarn, until disabled by arthritis.

In her 1961 obituary, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;The simple realism, nostalgic atmosphere and luminous color with which Grandma Moses portrayed simple farm life and rural countryside won her a wide following. She was able to capture the excitement of winter&#x27;s first snow, Thanksgiving preparations and the new, young green of oncoming spring ... In person, Grandma Moses charmed wherever she went. A tiny, lively woman with mischievous gray eyes and a quick wit, she could be sharp-tongued with a sycophant and stern with an errant grandchild.&quot;

Moses&#x27;s work has been a subject of numerous museum exhibitions worldwide and has been extensively merchandised, such as on greeting cards. In 2006, her 1943 painting titled &quot;Sugaring Off&quot; was sold at Christie&#x27;s New York for , setting an auction record for the artist.

==Early life==

Anna Mary Robertson was born in Greenwich, New York, on September 7, 1860; she was the third of ten children born to Margaret Shanahan Robertson and Russell King Robertson. She was raised with four sisters and five brothers. Her father ran a flax mill and was a farmer. She briefly attended a one-room school. That school is now the Bennington Museum in Vermont, which has the largest collection of her works in the United States. She was inspired to paint by taking art lessons at school. As a child, she started painting using lemon and grape juice to make colors for her &quot;landscapes&quot; and used ground ocher, grass, flour paste, slaked lime, and sawdust.

At age 12, she left home and performed farm chores for a wealthy neighboring family. She continued to keep house, cook, and sew for wealthy families for 15 years. One of these families, the Whitesides, noticed her interest in their Currier and Ives prints and bought her chalk and wax crayons.

==Marriage and children==

At age 27, she worked on the same farm with Thomas Salmon Moses, a &quot;hired man&quot;. They were married and established themselves near Staunton, Virginia, where they spent nearly two decades, living and working in turn on five local farms. Four of them are The Bell Farm or Eakle Farm, The Dudley Farm, Mount Airy Farm (now included within Augusta County&#x27;s Millway Place Industrial Park), and Mount Nebo. To supplement the family income at Mount Nebo, Anna made potato chips and churned butter from the milk of a cow that she purchased with her savings. Later, the couple bought a farm, Mount Airy, near Verona, Virginia; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Having bought the house in January 1901, it was the first residence the family owned. They lived there until September 1902.

Five of the ten children born to them survived infancy. Although she loved living in the Shenandoah Valley, in 1905 Anna and Thomas moved to a farm in Eagle Bridge, New York, at her husband&#x27;s urging. When Thomas Moses was about 67 years of age in 1927, he died of a heart attack, after which Anna&#x27;s son Forrest helped her operate the farm. She never married again. She retired and moved to a daughter&#x27;s home in 1936. She was known as either &quot;Mother Moses&quot; or &quot;Grandma Moses&quot;, and although she first exhibited as &quot;Mrs. Moses&quot;, the press dubbed her &quot;Grandma Moses&quot;, and the nickname stuck.

==Decorative arts==
As a young wife and mother, Moses was creative in her home; for example, in 1918 she used housepaint to decorate a fireboard. Beginning in 1932, Moses made embroidered pictures of yarn for friends and family. She created quilted objects, a form of &quot;hobby art&quot;. Lucy R. Lippard stated in &quot;The Word in Their Hands&quot; that she found &quot;hobby art&quot; to be &quot;an activity so &#x27;low&#x27; on the art lists that it still ranks way below &#x27;folk art&#x27;&quot;. She found that hobby art often involves reuse of otherwise discarded objects.

By the age of 76, Moses had developed arthritis, which made embroidery painful. Her sister Celestia suggested that painting would be easier for her, and this idea spurred Moses&#x27;s painting career in her late 70s. Grandma Moses also told reporters that she turned to painting in order to create the postman&#x27;s Christmas gift, seeing as it &quot;was easier to make [a painting] than to bake a cake over a hot stove&quot;. Being practical, painted works would last longer than her embroidered compositions made of worsted wool, which risked being eaten by moths. Judith Stein noted that &quot;her sense of accomplishment in her painting was rooted in her ability to make &#x27;something from nothing&#x27;&quot;.

==Art career==

What appeared to be an interest in painting at a late age was actually a manifestation of a childhood dream. With no time in her difficult farm life to pursue painting, she was obliged to set aside her passion to paint. At age 92 she wrote, &quot;I was quite small, my father would get me and my brothers white paper by the sheet. He liked to see us draw pictures, it was a penny a sheet and lasted longer than candy.&quot;

===Style===

Moses painted scenes of rural life from earlier days, which she called &quot;old-timey&quot; New England landscapes. Moses said that she would &quot;get an inspiration and start painting; then I&#x27;ll forget everything, everything except how things used to be and how to paint it so people will know how we used to live.&quot; From her works of art, she omitted features of modern life, such as tractors and telephone poles.

Her early style is less individual and more realistic or primitive, with a lack of knowledge of, or perhaps rejection of, basic perspective. Initially she created simple compositions or copied existing images. As her career advanced, she created complicated, panoramic compositions of rural life.

She was a prolific painter, generating more than 1,500 canvasses in three decades. She initially charged $3 to $5 for a painting, depending upon its size, and as her fame increased her works were sold for $8,000 to $10,000. Her winter paintings are reminiscent of some of the known winter paintings of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, although she had never seen his work. A German fan said, &quot;There emanates from her paintings a light-hearted optimism; the world she shows us is beautiful and it is good. You feel at home in all these pictures, and you know their meaning. The unrest and the neurotic insecurity of the present day make us inclined to enjoy the simple and affirmative outlook of Grandma Moses.&quot;

===Initial exhibitions===
During a visit to Hoosick Falls in 1938, Louis J. Caldor, an art collector who worked as an engineer in the state of New York, saw paintings made by Moses in the window of a drug store. He bought their supply and ten more from her Eagle Bridge house for $3 or $5 each. The next year, three Grandma Moses paintings were included in New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art exhibition titled &quot;Contemporary Unknown American Painters&quot;. Her first solo exhibition, &quot;What a Farm Wife Painted&quot;, opened in New York in October 1940 at Otto Kallir&#x27;s Galerie St. Etienne. A meet-and-greet with the artist and an exhibition of 50 paintings at Gimbel&#x27;s Department Store was held next on November 15. Her art displays included samples of her baked goods and preserves that won Moses prizes at the county fair. Her third solo show in as many months was held at the Whyte Gallery, Washington, D.C. In 1944, she was represented by the American British Art Center and the Galerie St. Etienne, which increased her sales. Her paintings were exhibited throughout Europe and the United States over the next 20 years. Otto Kallir established the Grandma Moses Properties, Inc. for her.

The paintings of Grandma Moses were used to publicize American holidays, including Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Mother&#x27;s Day. A Mother&#x27;s Day feature in &quot;True Confessions&quot; (1947) written by Eleanor Early noted how &quot;Grandma Moses remains prouder of her preserves than of her paintings, and proudest of all of her four children, eleven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.&quot; During the 1950s, her exhibitions broke attendance records around the world. Art historian Judith Stein noted: &quot;A cultural icon, the spry, productive nonagenarian was continually cited as an inspiration for housewives, widows and retirees.&quot; Her paintings were reproduced on Hallmark greeting cards, tiles, fabrics, and ceramics. They were also used to market products, like coffee, lipstick, cigarettes, and cameras.

===Acclaim===

In 1950, the National Press Club cited her as one of the five most newsworthy women and the National Association of House Dress Manufacturers honored her as their 1951 Woman of the Year. When she reached 88, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazine named her a &quot;Young Woman of the Year&quot;. She was awarded two honorary doctoral degrees. The first was bestowed in 1949 from Russell Sage College and the second two years later from the Moore College of Art and Design.

President Harry S. Truman presented her with the Women&#x27;s National Press Club trophy Award for outstanding accomplishment in art in 1949. Jerome Hill directed the 1950 documentary of her life, which was nominated for an Academy Award. In 1952, she published her autobiography, &quot;My Life&#x27;s History&quot;. In it she said &quot;I look back on my life like a good day&#x27;s work, it was done and I feel satisfied with it. I was happy and contented, I knew nothing better and made the best out of what life offered. And life is what we make it, always has been, always will be.&quot; In 1955, she appeared as a guest on &quot;See It Now&quot;, a television program hosted by Edward R. Murrow.

==Later years and death==
She was a member of the Society of Mayflower Descendants and Daughters of the American Revolution. Her 100th birthday was proclaimed &quot;Grandma Moses Day&quot; by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine celebrated her birthday by featuring her on its September 19, 1960, cover. The children&#x27;s book &quot;Grandma Moses Story Book&quot; was published in 1961.

Grandma Moses died at age 101 on December 13, 1961, at the Health Center in Hoosick Falls, New York. She is buried there at the Maple Grove Cemetery. President John F. Kennedy memorialized her: &quot;The death of Grandma Moses removed a beloved figure from American life. The directness and vividness of her paintings restored a primitive freshness to our perception of the American scene. Both her work and her life helped our nation renew its pioneer heritage and recall its roots in the countryside and on the frontier. All Americans mourn her loss.&quot; After her death, her work was exhibited in several large traveling exhibitions in the United States and abroad.

==Legacy==

A 1942 piece, &quot;The Old Checkered House, 1862&quot;, was appraised at the Memphis 2004 &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;. It was not as common as her winter landscapes. Originally purchased in the 1940s for under $10, the piece was assigned an insurance value of $60,000 by the appraiser, Alan Fausel.

In November 2006, her 1943 work &quot;Sugaring Off&quot; became her highest-selling work at US $1.2 million.

Otto Kallir of the Galerie St. Etienne gave her painting &quot;July Fourth&quot; (1951) to the White House as a gift in 1952. The painting also appears on a U.S. commemorative stamp that was issued in Grandma Moses&#x27;s honor in 1969.

The character Daisy &quot;Granny&quot; Moses (Irene Ryan) on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, was named as an homage to Grandma Moses, who died shortly before the series began.

Norman Rockwell and Grandma Moses were friends who lived across the Vermont–New York state border from each other. Moses lived in Eagle Bridge, New York, and after 1938 the Rockwells had a house in nearby Arlington, Vermont. She appears on the far left edge in the Norman Rockwell painting &quot;Christmas Homecoming,&quot; which was printed on &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;″s December 25, 1948, cover.

<text>George Francis Abbott (June 25, 1887January 31, 1995) was an American theatre producer, director, playwright, screenwriter, film director and producer whose career spanned eight decades. He received numerous honors including six Tony Awards, the Pulitzer Prize, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1982. the National Medal of Arts in 1990. and was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame.

Starting as an actor he later became known for producing numerous Broadway productions such as &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1940), &quot;On the Town&quot; (1944), &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; (1950), &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; (1953), &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; (1954), &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1955), &quot;New Girl in Town&quot; (1957), &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot; (1959), &quot;Fiorello!&quot; (book, 1959), &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1962), &quot;Broadway&quot; (1987), &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1994).

Abbot also acted in numerous films in the 1920s and 1930s. He received an Academy Award for Best Writing nomination for &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930). He later directed the movie musicals adaptations of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; (1957), and &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1958).

==Early years==
Abbott was born in Forestville, New York, to George Burwell Abbott (May 1858 Erie County, New York – February 4, 1942 Hamburg, New York) and Hannah May McLaury (1869 – June 20, 1940 Hamburg, New York). He later moved to the city of Salamanca, which twice elected his father mayor. In 1898, his family moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming, where he attended Kearney Military Academy. Within a few years, his family returned to New York, and he graduated from Hamburg High School in 1907.

In 1911 he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Rochester, where he wrote his first play, &quot;Perfectly Harmless&quot;, for the University Dramatic Club. Abbott then attended Harvard University, to take a course in playwriting from George Pierce Baker. Under Baker&#x27;s tutelage, he wrote &quot;The Head of the Family&quot;, which was performed at the Harvard Dramatic Club in 1912. He then worked for a year as 
&quot;author, gofer, and actor&quot; at the Bijou Theatre in Boston, where his play &quot;The Man in the Manhole&quot; won a contest.

==Career==

Abbott started acting on Broadway in 1913, debuting in &quot;The Misleading Lady&quot;. While acting in several plays in New York City, he began to write; his first successful play was &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; (1925).

Abbott acquired a reputation as an astute &quot;show doctor&quot;. He frequently was called upon to supervise changes when a show was having difficulties in tryouts or previews prior to its Broadway opening. His first hit was &quot;Broadway&quot;, written and directed in partnership with Philip Dunning, whose play Abbott &quot;rejiggered&quot;. It opened on September 16, 1926, at the Broadhurst Theatre and ran for 603 performances. Other successes followed, and it was a rare year that did not have an Abbott production on Broadway.

He also worked in Hollywood as a film writer and director while continuing with his theatre work.

Among those who worked with Abbott early in their careers are Desi Arnaz, Gene Kelly, June Havoc, Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Leonard Bernstein, Jules Styne, Stephen Sondheim, Elaine Stritch, John Kander, Fred Ebb, Carol Burnett and Liza Minnelli. He introduced the &quot;fast-paced, tightly integrated style that influenced&quot; performers and especially directors such as Jerome Robbins, Bob Fosse and Hal Prince.

==Autobiography ==
In 1963, he published his autobiography, &quot;Mister Abbott&quot;.

==Personal life==
Abbott was married to Edna Lewis from 1914 to her death in 1930; they had one child. Actress Mary Sinclair was his second wife. Their marriage lasted from 1946 until their 1951 divorce. He had a long romance with actress Maureen Stapleton from 1968 to 1978. She was 43 and he was 81 when they began their affair, then ten years later Abbott left her for a younger woman. His third wife was Joy Valderrama. They were married from 1983 until his death in 1995.

Abbott was a vigorous man who remained active past his 100th birthday by golfing and dancing. He died from complications of a stroke on January 31, 1995, at his home on Sunset Island off Miami Beach, Florida, at age 107. &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary read, &quot;Mrs. Abbott said that a week and a half before his death he was dictating revisions to the second act of &quot;Pajama Game&quot; with a revival in mind, in addition to working on a revival of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;.

At the age of 106, he walked down the aisle on opening night of the &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; revival and received a standing ovation. He was heard saying to his companion, &#x27;There must be somebody important here.&#x27;&quot; Just thirteen days before his 107th birthday, Abbott made an appearance at the 48th Tony Awards, coming onstage with fellow &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; alumni Gwen Verdon and Jean Stapleton at the end of the opening number, a medley performed by the nominees for Best Revival of A Musical, which included &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;She Loves Me&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, and his own &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;.

He was cremated at Woodlawn Park Cemetery in Miami and the ashes were taken by his wife.

==Family==

In addition to his wife, who died in 2020 at 88, Abbott was survived by a sister, Isabel Juergens, who died a year later at the age of 102; two granddaughters, Amy Clark Davidson and Susan Clark Hansley; a grandson, George Clark, and six great-grandchildren.

==Honors==
In 1965, the 54th Street Theatre was rechristened the George Abbott Theatre in his honor. The building was demolished in 1970. New York City&#x27;s George Abbott Way, the section of West 45th Street northwest of Times Square, is also named after him.

He received New York City&#x27;s Handel Medallion in 1976, honorary doctorates from the Universities of Rochester and Miami, and the Kennedy Centre Honors in 1982. He was also inducted into the Western New York Entertainment Hall of Fame and the American Theatre Hall of Fame. In 1990, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts.

<doc id="104454" wikidata="Q278825" url="?curid=104454" title="Charles Spurgeon">
<text>Charles Haddon Spurgeon (19th June 1834 – 31st January 1892) was an English Particular Baptist preacher. Spurgeon remains highly influential among Christians of various denominations, to some of whom he is known as the &quot;Prince of Preachers.&quot; He was a strong figure in the Reformed Baptist tradition, defending the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith, and opposing the liberal and pragmatic theological tendencies in the Church of his day.

Spurgeon was pastor of the congregation of the New Park Street Chapel (later the Metropolitan Tabernacle) in London for 38 years. He was part of several controversies with the Baptist Union of Great Britain and later he left the denomination over doctrinal convictions.

While at the Metropolitan Tabernacle, he built an Almshouse and the Stockwell Orphanage. He encouraged his congregation to engage actively with the poor of Victorian London. He also founded Spurgeon&#x27;s College, which was named after him posthumously.

Spurgeon authored sermons, an autobiography, commentaries, books on prayer, devotionals, magazines, poetry, and hymns. Many sermons were transcribed as he spoke and were translated into many languages during his lifetime. He is said to have produced powerful sermons of penetrating thought and precise exposition. His oratory skills are said to have held his listeners spellbound in the Metropolitan Tabernacle, and many Christians hold his writings in exceptionally high regard among devotional literature.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Born in Kelvedon, Essex, he moved with his family to Colchester at 10 months old. 

The missionary Richard Knill spent several days with Spurgeon while visiting his grandfather in 1844; he announced to him and his family that the child would one day preach the gospel to great multitudes. 

Spurgeon&#x27;s conversion from nominal Congregationalism came on 6th of January 1850, at age 15. On his way to a scheduled appointment, a snowstorm forced him to cut short his intended journey and to turn into a Primitive Methodist chapel in Artillery Street, Newtown, Colchester, where he believed God opened his heart to the salvation message. 
The text that moved him was Isaiah 45:22 (&quot;Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none else&quot;). Later that year, on April 4th, he was admitted to the church at Newmarket. His baptism followed on 3rd May in the river Lark, at Isleham. Later that same year he moved to Cambridge, where he later became a Sunday school teacher. Spurgeon preached his first sermon in the winter of 1850–51 in a cottage at Teversham while filling in for a friend. From the beginning of Spurgeon&#x27;s ministry, his style and ability were considered to be far above average. In the same year, he was installed as pastor of the small Baptist church at Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, where he published his first literary work, a Gospel tract written in 1853.

===New Park Street Chapel===

In April 1854, after preaching three months on probation and just four years after his conversion, Spurgeon, then only 19 years old, was called to the pastorate of London&#x27;s famed New Park Street Chapel in Southwark (formerly pastored by the Particular Baptists Benjamin Keach, and theologian John Gill). This was the largest Baptist congregation in London at the time, although it had dwindled in numbers for several years. Spurgeon found friends in London among his fellow pastors, such as William Garrett Lewis of Westballs Grove Church, an older man who along with Spurgeon went on to found the London Baptist Association. 
Within a few months of Spurgeon&#x27;s arrival at Park Street, his ability as a preacher made him famous. The following year the first of his sermons in the &quot;New Park Street Pulpit&quot; was published. Spurgeon&#x27;s sermons were published in printed form every week and had a high circulation. By the time of his death in 1892, he had preached nearly 3,600 sermons and published 49 volumes of commentaries, sayings, anecdotes, illustrations and devotions.

Immediately following his fame was criticism. The first attack in the press appeared in the &quot;Earthen Vessel&quot; in January 1855. His preaching, although not revolutionary in substance, was a plain-spoken and direct appeal to the people, using the Bible to provoke them to consider the teachings of Jesus Christ. Critical attacks from the media persisted throughout his life. The congregation quickly outgrew their building and moved to Exeter Hall, then to Surrey Music Hall. At 22, Spurgeon was the most popular preacher of the day.
On 8th of January 1856, Spurgeon married Susannah, daughter of Robert Thompson of Falcon Square, London, by whom he had twin sons, Charles and Thomas born on September 20th, 1856. At the end of that year, tragedy struck on 19th of October 1856, as Spurgeon was preaching at the Surrey Gardens Music Hall for the first time. Someone in the crowd yelled, &quot;FIRE&quot;. The ensuing panic and stampede left several dead. Spurgeon was emotionally impacted by the event and it had a sobering influence on his life. For many years he spoke of being moved to tears for no reason known to himself.
Walter Thornbury later wrote in &quot;Old and New London&quot; (1898) describing a subsequent meeting at Surrey:
Spurgeon&#x27;s work went on. A Pastors&#x27; College was founded in 1856 by Spurgeon and was renamed Spurgeon&#x27;s College in 1923, when it moved to its present building in South Norwood Hill, London. At the Fast Day, 7 October 1857, he preached to his largest crowd ever – 23,654 people – at The Crystal Palace in London. Spurgeon noted:
===Metropolitan Tabernacle===
On 18 March 1861, the congregation moved permanently to the newly constructed purpose-built Metropolitan Tabernacle at Elephant and Castle, Southwark, seating 5,000 people with standing room for another 1,000. The Metropolitan Tabernacle was the largest church edifice of its day. Spurgeon continued to preach there several times per week until his death 31 years later. He never gave altar calls at the conclusion of his sermons, but he always extended the invitation that if anyone was moved to seek an interest in Christ by his preaching on a Sunday, they could meet with him at his vestry on Monday morning. Without fail, there was always someone at his door the next day.

He wrote his sermons out fully before he preached, but what he carried up to the pulpit was a note card with an outline sketch. Stenographers would take down the sermon as it was delivered and Spurgeon would then have the opportunity to make revisions to the transcripts the following day for immediate publication. His weekly sermons, which sold for a penny each, were widely circulated and still remain one of the all-time best-selling series of writings published in history.


Besides sermons, Spurgeon also wrote several hymns and published a new collection of worship songs in 1866 called &quot;Our Own Hymn Book&quot;. It was mostly a compilation of Isaac Watts&#x27;s Psalms and Hymns that had been originally selected by John Rippon, a Baptist predecessor to Spurgeon. Singing in the congregation was exclusively a cappella under his pastorate. Thousands heard the preaching and were led in the singing without any amplification of sound that exists today. Hymns were a subject that he took seriously. While Spurgeon was still preaching at New Park Street, he entered the &quot;Rivulet&quot; controversy over a hymn book. He found its theology largely deistic. At the end of his review, he warned:

We shall soon have to handle truth, not with kid gloves, but with gauntlets, – the gauntlets of holy courage and integrity. Go on, ye warriors of the cross, for the King is at the head of you.

On 5th June 1862, Spurgeon challenged the Church of England when he preached against baptismal regeneration. However, Spurgeon taught across denominational lines as well: for example, in 1877 he was the preacher at the opening of a new Free Church of Scotland church building in Dingwall. It was during this period at the new Tabernacle that Spurgeon found a friend in James Hudson Taylor, the founder of the inter-denominational China Inland Mission. Spurgeon supported the work of the mission financially and directed many missionary candidates to apply for service with Taylor. He also aided in the work of cross-cultural evangelism by promoting &quot;The Wordless Book&quot;, a teaching tool that he described in a message given on 11 January 1866, regarding Psalm 51:7: &quot;Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.&quot; The book has been and is still used to teach people without reading skills and people of other cultures and languages – young and old – around the globe about the Gospel message.

On the death of missionary David Livingstone in 1873, a discoloured and much-used copy of one of Spurgeon&#x27;s printed sermons, &quot;Accidents, Not Punishments,&quot; was found among his few possessions much later, along with the handwritten comment at the top of the first page: &quot;Very good, D.L.&quot; He had carried it with him throughout his travels in Africa. It was sent to Spurgeon and treasured by him.

===Metropolitan Tabernacle Societies and Institutions===
In 1876, 22 years after becoming pastor, Spurgeon published &quot;The Metropolitan Tabernacle: Its History and Work&quot;. His intention stated in the preface is to give a &#x27;printed history of the Tabernacle&#x27;. The book has 15 chapters and of these 5 are given over to what he called &#x27;Societies and Institutions&#x27;.

The Five Chapters are:

xi. The Almshouses. Explaining how the New Park Street Chapel site was sold to allow the Tabernacle to build an Almshouse and school.

xiii. The Stockwell Orphanage. This opened for 240 boys in 1867 (and later for girls in 1879). These orphanages continued in London until they were bombed in the Second World War. The inspiration for starting an orphanage came from a visit with George Müller. The orphanage changed its name to Spurgeon&#x27;s Child Care in 1937, and again in 2005 to Spurgeons. Spurgeon was linked more with the Stockwell orphanage than any other Metropolitan Tabernacle endeavour. There are probably four reasons for this:

xiv. The Colportage Association. Colporters were employed to take Bibles, good books and periodicals for sale, from house to house. They also were involved in visiting the sick and holding meetings.

xv. Other Institutions Connected with the Tabernacle. Here Spurgeon describes 21 other &#x27;Institutions&#x27;. Two examples are: The Ordinance Poor Fund which distributed money amongst poor members of the church of about £800 annually, and the Ladies&#x27; Benevolent Society. This group made clothing for the poor and &#x27;relieved&#x27; them, with an income of £105.

Eight years later at Spurgeon&#x27;s fiftieth birthday celebration an updated list of &#x27;Societies and Institutions&#x27; was read out. With Spurgeon&#x27;s strong encouragement and support the 24 groups listed in &#x27;The Metropolitan Tabernacle: Its History and Work&#x27;, had become 69. Before they are read out Spurgeon says: &quot;I think everybody should know what the church has been moved to do, and I beg to say that there are other societies besides those which will be mentioned, but you will be tired before you get to the end of them.&quot; and finishes after the list by saying: &quot;We have need to praise God that he enables the church to carry on all these institutions.&quot;

Spurgeon&#x27;s encouragement for members of the Tabernacle to be involved in these ministries was very strong. Spurgeon&#x27;s own regular contributions to them meant that he left his wife only 2,000 pounds, when he died, despite having earned millions from his published sermons and books.

He encouraged others to give, with comments like these:

On the Green Walk Mission: &quot;Here a good hall must be built. If some generous friend would build a place for this mission, the money would be well laid out&quot;,

On colporters: &quot;Mr Charlesworth’s two Bible classes have generously agreed to support a brother with a Bible Carriage in the streets of London. Would not some other communities of young people do well to have their own man at work in the regions where they dwell? THINK OF IT&quot;,

On the almshouses: &quot;WE GREATLY NEED AT LEAST £5000 TO ENDOW THE ALMHOUSES, AND PLACE THE INSTITUTION UPON A PROPER FOOTING. Already C. H. Spurgeon, Thomas Olney, and Thomas Greenwood have contributed £200 each towards the fund, and we earnestly trust that either by donations or legacies the rest of the £5000 will be forthcoming.&quot;

Spurgeon had one infirmary built, at the Stockwell Orphanage. However, he also recognised that the poor had limited access to health care and so was also an enthusiastic supporter of the Metropolitan Hospital Sunday Fund. He left us this quote: 
===Downgrade controversy===

A controversy among the Baptists flared in 1887 with Spurgeon&#x27;s first &quot;Down-grade&quot; article, published in &quot;The Sword &amp; the Trowel&quot;. In the ensuing &quot;Downgrade Controversy,&quot; the Metropolitan Tabernacle disaffiliated from the Baptist Union, effectuating Spurgeon&#x27;s congregation as the world&#x27;s largest self-standing church. Spurgeon framed the controversy in this way:
The controversy took its name from Spurgeon&#x27;s use of the term &quot;Downgrade&quot; to describe certain other Baptists&#x27; outlook toward the Bible (&quot;i.e.&quot;, they had &quot;downgraded&quot; the Bible and the principle of &quot;sola scriptura&quot;). Spurgeon alleged that an incremental creeping of the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis, Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, and other concepts were weakening the Baptist Union. Spurgeon emphatically decried the doctrine that resulted: 
The standoff caused division amongst the Baptists and other non-conformists and is regarded by many as an important paradigm.

===Opposition to slavery===

Spurgeon strongly opposed the owning of slaves. He lost support from the Southern Baptists, sales of his sermons dropped, and he received scores of threatening and insulting letters as a consequence.
In a letter to the &quot;Christian Watchman and Reflector&quot; (Boston), Spurgeon declared:
===Restorationism===
Like other Baptists of his time, despite opposing Dispensationalism, Spurgeon anticipated the restoration of the Jews to inhabit the Promised Land.
===Final years and death===

Spurgeon&#x27;s wife was often too ill to leave home to hear him preach.

Spurgeon had a long history of poor health. He was already being reported as having gout when he was 33.
By 1871, when he was 37 he was already being advised by his doctors to leave town for his health.

His favourite place to go to rest was Menton in the South of France. He was often there in the winter months. He was there often enough to have visitors, with George Müller visiting in 1879 and members of the Baptist Union in 1887, attempting to get him to rejoin the Union.

When he was on the improve in Menton he would preach in the local church, or write, such as in 1890 when he wrote a commentary on Matthew while ‘resting’.

He became increasingly unwell and in May 1891 he was forced &#x27;to rest&#x27;. In 1891 he went to rest in Menton and remained there for three months. During this period he wrote 180 pages of commentary.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Times 11/2/1892&quot;&gt;The Times 11/2/1892&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not recover and died at the age of 57, while still in Menton, from gout and congestion of the kidneys. From May 1891 until his death in January 1892, he received 10,000 letters of &#x27;condolence, resolutions of sympathy, telegrams of enquiry&#x27;.

After Spurgeon&#x27;s body was returned to England it lay in repose in the Metropolitan Tabernacle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Western Mail 12/2/1892&quot;&gt;Western Mail 12/2/1892&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days prior to the funeral, four memorial services were held at the Metropolitan Tabernacle. The first service at 11 am was for those with current communion cards, the second at 3 pm was for ministers and student pastors, the third at 7 pm was for Christians who hadn&#x27;t gotten in yet and the final service at 11 pm included the Stockwell Orphans. Police controlled the crowds waiting to get in during the day, and to help with order, at the end of services people left through a back door.

On the day of the funeral, eight hundred extra police were on duty along the route the cortège took, from the Metropolitan Tabernacle, past the Stockwell Orphanage and to the Norwood Cemetery. Accounts vary about the number of carriages in the cortege. One account puts it as: 
Extra trains were put on to cater for the crowd, along with extra omnibuses and cabs. Except for a few tobacco shops and taverns, the businesses along the funeral route were shut, with some houses displaying black and white material. An estimated total of 100,000 people either passed by Spurgeon as he lay in state or attended the funeral services. An unknown number lined the streets for the cortége. As the cortége passed the Stockwell Orphanage it stopped briefly while the children sang a verse of one of his favourite hymns “For ever with the Lord,” with the refrain “Nearer home.”. Along the route, some flags were at half-mast.

Spurgeon was survived by his wife and sons. His remains were buried at West Norwood Cemetery in London, where the tomb is still visited by admirers. His son Tom became the pastor of the Metropolitan Tabernacle after his father died.
==Library==
William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri, purchased Spurgeon&#x27;s 5,103-volume library collection for £500 ($2500) in 1906. The collection was purchased by Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Kansas City, Missouri, in 2006 for $400,000 and can be seen on display at the Spurgeon Center on the campus of Midwestern Seminary. A special collection of Spurgeon&#x27;s handwritten sermon notes and galley proofs from 1879 to 1891 resides at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama. Spurgeon&#x27;s College in London also has a small number of notes and proofs. Spurgeon&#x27;s personal Bible, with his handwritten notes, is on display in the library of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, KY.

<text>A curb cut (U.S.), curb ramp, depressed curb, dropped kerb (UK), pram ramp, or kerb ramp (Australia) is a solid (usually concrete) ramp graded down from the top surface of a sidewalk to the surface of an adjoining street. It is designed primarily for pedestrian usage and commonly found in urban areas where pedestrian activity is expected. In comparison with a conventional curb (finished at a right angle above the street surface) a curb cut is finished at an intermediate gradient that connects both surfaces, sometimes with tactile paving.

==History==
Historically speaking, footpaths were finished at right angles to the street surface with conventional stepped curb treatments. Their introduction to help people pushing prams dates back at least as far as the 1930s in the UK.

Kalamazoo, Michigan installed curb cuts in the 1940s as a pilot project introduced by veteran and lawyer Jack H. Fischer to aid employment of veterans with disabilities. A major project in Berkeley, California led by the grassroots Center for Independent Living led to curb cuts up and down Telegraph and Shattuck Avenues creating an extensive path of travel. Following this, the value of curb cuts was promoted more strongly and their installation was often made on a voluntary basis by municipal authorities and developers. 

Curb cuts in Western countries have been mandated by legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) in the United States (which requires that curb cuts be present on all sidewalks) or the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 in Australia. The legislative requirements in some jurisdictions have been increased from the original requirements in recent times, to the point where existing treatments can now fail to meet the most recent design requirements.

When the ramps are used by a broader population than just the disabled, for whom the curb cut requirement was legislated, this new convenience can be seen as a positive externality, and has become known as the curb cut effect.

==Users and uses==

Curb cuts placed at street intersections allow for certain people, such as wheelchair users, baby carriages, and others to move onto or off of a sidewalk with less difficulty. Many curb cuts also feature tactile paving, a pattern of circular bumps that indicate to visually impaired pedestrians that they are about to enter a roadway.

Curb cuts also benefit pedestrians and people using a walker or cane, pushing or pulling a cart or hand truck, or walking next to a bicycle; as well as anyone riding a bicycle, roller skates, or a skateboard.

==Other applications==
A wider curb cut is also useful for motor vehicles to enter a driveway or parking lot on the other side of a sidewalk. In the UK this is commonly referred to as a &#x27;crossover&#x27;.

Smaller curb cuts may be used along streets, parking areas or sidewalks in the manner of a water bar; by redirecting water from traditional drainage ways to stormwater BMPs which allow infiltration, such as a grassed area or rain garden.

==Design==
Accessible curb cuts transition from the low side of a curb to the high side (usually change in level). Accessible curb ramps are a minimum of wide. They are sloped no greater than 1:12 (8.33%), which means that for every of horizontal distance, they rise no more than . The concrete curb ramp is sometimes scored with grooves, the texture of which may serve as a warning to vision-impaired persons of the transition to the street. Such grooves also allow for traction and water runoff, and may be stained a color that significantly contrasts with the adjacent concrete. If a curb ramp contains flared sides, they are usually no greater than 1:10 (10%) slope.

Pram ramps in Australia are designed according to &quot;Australian Standard AS 1428: Design for access and mobility&quot;.

=== Universal design ===
Proponents of universal design often point to the curb cut effect as an example when raising awareness of the benefits of this design philosophy.

<text>Gustav IV Adolf or Gustav IV Adolph (1 November 1778 – 7 February 1837) was King of Sweden from 1792 until he was deposed in a coup in 1809. He was also the last Swedish monarch to be the ruler of Finland.

The occupation of Finland in 1808–09 by Russian forces was the immediate cause of Gustav Adolf&#x27;s overthrow, violently initiated by officers of his own army. Following his abdication on 29 March 1809, an Instrument of Government was hastily written, which severely circumscribed the powers of the monarchy. The &quot;Instrument&quot; was adopted in 1809 on 6 June, the National Day of Sweden now as well as in his time. It remained in force until replaced in 1974. The crown, now with strictly limited powers, passed to Gustav Adolf&#x27;s uncle Charles XIII.

==Early life==

Gustav Adolf was born in Stockholm on 1 November 1778 as the son of Gustav III and queen Sophia Magdalena. His mother was the eldest daughter of Frederick V of Denmark and Louise of Great Britain.

Gustav Adolf was under the tutelage of Hedvig Sofia von Rosen and her deputies Brita Ebba Celestina von Stauden and Maria Aurora Uggla until the age of 4. He was then raised under the tutelage of his father and the liberal-minded Nils von Rosenstein. Upon Gustav III&#x27;s assassination in March 1792, Gustav Adolf succeeded to the throne at the age of 13, under the regency of his uncle, Prince Charles, Duke of Södermanland, who was later to become King Charles XIII when his nephew was forced to abdicate and was banished from the country in 1809.

In August 1796, his uncle the regent arranged for the young king to visit Saint Petersburg. The intention was to arrange a marriage between the young king and Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna, a granddaughter of Catherine the Great. However, the whole arrangement foundered on Gustav Adolf&#x27;s unwavering refusal to allow his intended bride liberty of worship according to the rites of the Russian Orthodox Church. Nobody seems to have suspected the possibility at the time that emotional problems might lie at the root of Gustav Adolf&#x27;s abnormal piety. On the contrary, when he came of age that year, thereby ending the regency, there were many who prematurely congratulated themselves on the fact that Sweden had now no disturbing genius, but an economical, God-fearing, commonplace monarch.

==Politics==
Gustav Adolf&#x27;s prompt dismissal of the generally detested Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm, the duke-regent&#x27;s leading advisor, added still further to his popularity. On 31 October 1797, Gustav married Friederike Dorothea, granddaughter of Karl Friedrich, Margrave of Baden, a marriage which seemed to threaten war with Russia but for the fanatical hatred of the French republic shared by the Emperor Paul of Russia and Gustav IV Adolf, which served as a bond between them. Indeed, the king&#x27;s horror of Jacobinism was intense, and drove him to become increasingly committed to the survival of Europe, to the point where he postponed his coronation for some years, so as to avoid calling together a diet. Nonetheless, the disorder of the state finances, largely inherited from Gustav III&#x27;s war against Russia, as well as widespread crop failures in 1798 and 1799, compelled him to summon the estates to Norrköping in March 1800 and on 3 April the same year. When the king encountered serious opposition at the Riksdag, he resolved never to call another.

==Loss of Finland==

His reign was ill-fated and was to end abruptly. In 1805, he joined the Third Coalition. 
against Napoleon. His campaign went poorly and the French occupied Swedish Pomerania. When his ally, Russia, made peace and concluded an alliance with France at Tilsit in 1807, Sweden and Portugal were left as Great Britain&#x27;s only allies on the European continent. On 21 February 1808, Russia invaded Finland, which was ruled by Sweden, on the pretext of compelling Sweden to join Napoleon&#x27;s Continental System. Denmark likewise declared war on Sweden. In just a few months, almost all of Finland was lost to Russia. As a result of the war, on 17 September 1809, in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn, Sweden surrendered the eastern third of Sweden to Russia. Following which the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was established within Imperial Russia.

==Coup d&#x27;état and abdication==

Gustav Adolf was deposed by a conspiracy of army officers.

On 7 March 1809, lieutenant-colonel Georg Adlersparre, commander of a part of the so-called western army stationed in Värmland, triggered the Coup of 1809 by raising the flag of rebellion in Karlstad and starting to march upon Stockholm. To prevent the king from joining loyal troops in Scania, on 13 March 1809 seven of the conspirators led by Carl Johan Adlercreutz broke into the royal apartments in the palace, seized the king, and imprisoned him and his family in Gripsholm Castle; the king&#x27;s uncle, Duke Charles (Karl), accepted the leadership of a provisional government, which was proclaimed the same day; and a diet, hastily summoned, solemnly approved of the revolution.

On 29 March, Gustav IV Adolf, to save the crown for his son, voluntarily abdicated; but on 10 May, the Riksdag of the Estates, dominated by the army, declared that not merely Gustav but his whole family had forfeited the throne, perhaps an excuse to exclude his family from succession based on the rumours of his illegitimacy. A more likely cause, however, is that the revolutionaries feared that Gustav Adolf&#x27;s son, if he inherited the throne, would avenge his father&#x27;s deposition when he came of age. On 5 June, Gustav Adolf&#x27;s uncle was proclaimed King Charles XIII, after accepting a new liberal constitution, which was ratified by the diet the next day. In December, Gustav Adolf and his family were transported to Germany. In 1812, he divorced his wife.

In exile Gustav Adolf used several titles, including Count Gottorp and Duke of Holstein-Eutin, and finally settled at St. Gallen in Switzerland where he lived in a small hotel in great loneliness and indigence, under the name of Colonel Gustafsson. It was there that he suffered a stroke and died on 7 February 1837. He was buried in Moravia. At the suggestion of King Oscar II and Norway, his body was finally brought to Sweden and interred in Riddarholm Church. Gustav Adolf was the great-grandfather of Victoria of Baden, Oscar&#x27;s new daughter-in-law at the time and eventually Queen of Sweden as consort to Oscar&#x27;s son Gustaf V.

== Arms ==
==Ancestry==
==Family==
On 31 October 1797, he married Frederica Dorothea Wilhelmina of Baden, with whom he had five children:

# Crown Prince Gustav, after 1809 known as &quot;Gustaf Gustafsson, Prince of Vasa&quot; (9 November 1799 – 4/5 August 1877). He served as an officer in the service of the Habsburgs of Austria, and with his wife Princess Louise Amelie of Baden, fathered a son who died in infancy, and a daughter, Carola, the wife of Albert, King of Saxony. She died childless.
# Princess Sofia Wilhelmina (21 May 1801 – 6 July 1865). She married Grand Duke Leopold of Baden, and their granddaughter Victoria of Baden married the Bernadotte king Gustaf V. (The present King Carl XVI Gustaf is thus a descendant of Gustav IV).
# Prince Carl Gustaf, Grand Duke of Finland (2 December 1802 – 10 September 1805)
# Princess Amalia (22 February 1805 – 31 August 1853); unmarried and without issue
# Princess Cecilia (22 June 1807 – 27 January 1844). She married Augustus, Grand Duke of Oldenburg, and had issue.

By 1812, Gustav Adolf divorced his consort, and following this he had several mistresses, among them Maria Schlegel, who gave him a son, Adolf Gustafsson (1820–1907), styled Count Gustafson, married in 1856 to Ernestine Simon (1823–1911), no children.

<text>The Liouville lambda function, denoted by and named after Joseph Liouville, is an important arithmetic function. 
Its value is if is the product of an even number of prime numbers, and if it is the product of an odd number of primes. 

Explicitly, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that any positive integer can be represented uniquely as a product of powers of primes: , where are primes and the are positive integers. ( is given by the empty product.) The prime omega functions count the number of primes, with () or without () multiplicity:

: formula_1
: formula_2

 is defined by the formula

: formula_3

 is completely multiplicative since is completely additive, i.e.: . Since has no prime factors, , so .

It is related to the Möbius function . Write as , where is squarefree, i.e., . Then

: formula_4

The sum of the Liouville function over the divisors of is the characteristic function of the squares:

:formula_5

Möbius inversion of this formula yields
:formula_6

The Dirichlet inverse of Liouville function is the absolute value of the Möbius function, , the characteristic function of the squarefree integers. We also have that .

==Series==
The Dirichlet series for the Liouville function is related to the Riemann zeta function by

:formula_7

Also:

:formula_8

The Lambert series for the Liouville function is

:formula_9

where formula_10 is the Jacobi theta function.

==Conjectures on weighted summatory functions==



The Pólya problem is a question raised made by George Pólya in 1919. Defining

: formula_11 ,

the problem asks whether formula_12 for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1. The answer turns out to be no. The smallest counter-example is &quot;n&quot; = 906150257, found by Minoru Tanaka in 1980. It has since been shown that &quot;L&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &gt; 0.0618672 for infinitely many positive integers &quot;n&quot;, while it can also be shown via the same methods that &quot;L&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &lt; -1.3892783 for infinitely many positive integers &quot;n&quot;.

For any formula_13, assuming the Riemann hypothesis, we have that the summatory function formula_14 is bounded by 

:formula_15 

where the formula_16 is some absolute limiting constant.

Define the related sum

: formula_17

It was open for some time whether &quot;T&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) ≥ 0 for sufficiently big &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;n&quot;0 (this conjecture is occasionally–though incorrectly–attributed to Pál Turán). This was then disproved by , who showed that &quot;T&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) takes negative values infinitely often. A confirmation of this positivity conjecture would have led to a proof of the Riemann hypothesis, as was shown by Pál Turán. 

===Generalizations===

More generally, we can consider the weighted summatory functions over the Liouville function defined for any formula_18 as follows for positive integers &quot;x&quot; where (as above) we have the special cases formula_19 and formula_20 

:formula_21 

These formula_22-weighted summatory functions are related to the Mertens function, or weighted summatory functions of the Moebius function. In fact, we have that the so-termed non-weighted, or ordinary function formula_23 precisely corresponds to the sum 

:formula_24 

Moreover, these functions satisfy similar bounding asymptotic relations. For example, whenever formula_25, we see that there exists an absolute constant formula_26 such that 

:formula_27

By an application of Perron&#x27;s formula, or equivalently by a key (inverse) Mellin transform, we have that 

:formula_28 

which then can be inverted via the inverse transform to show that for formula_29, formula_30 and formula_31 

:formula_32

where we can take formula_33, and with the remainder terms defined such that formula_34 and formula_35 as formula_36. 

In particular, if we assume that the 
Riemann hypothesis (RH) is true and that all of the non-trivial zeros, denoted by formula_37, of the Riemann zeta function are simple, then for any formula_31 and formula_39 there exists an infinite sequence of formula_40 which satisfies that formula_41 for all &quot;v&quot; such that 

:formula_42 

where for any increasingly small formula_43 we define 

:formula_44 

and where the remainder term 

:formula_45 

which of course tends to &quot;0&quot; as formula_36. These exact analytic formula expansions again share similar properties to those corresponding to the weighted Mertens function cases. Additionally, since formula_47 we have another similarity in the form of formula_48 to formula_49 in so much as the dominant leading term in the previous formulas predicts a negative bias in the values of these functions over the positive natural numbers &quot;x&quot;.

<text>Alfred Mossman Landon (September 9, 1887October 12, 1987) was an American oilman and politician who served as the 26th governor of Kansas from 1933 to 1937. A member of the Republican Party, he was the party&#x27;s nominee in the 1936 presidential election, and was defeated in a landslide by incumbent president Franklin D. Roosevelt. The margin of victory in the electoral college was the largest of Roosevelt&#x27;s four elections to the office of president, as Landon won just 8 electoral votes to Roosevelt&#x27;s 523. Landon died on October 12, 1987, becoming the only presidential candidate from either of the major parties to live to the age of 100 until Jimmy Carter in 2024, and is to date the only Republican candidate to do so.

Born in West Middlesex, Pennsylvania, Landon spent most of his childhood in Marietta, Ohio, before moving to Kansas. After graduating from the University of Kansas, he became an independent oil producer in Lawrence, Kansas. His business made him a millionaire, and he became a leader of the liberal Republicans in Kansas. Landon won election as Governor of Kansas in 1932 and sought to reduce taxes and balance the budget in the midst of the Great Depression. He supported components of the New Deal but criticized aspects that he found inefficient.

The 1936 Republican National Convention selected Landon as the Republican Party&#x27;s presidential nominee. He proved to be an ineffective campaigner and carried just two states in the election, neither of which was Kansas despite him being the sitting governor of that state. After the election, he left office as governor and never sought public office again. Later in life, he supported the Marshall Plan and President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society programs. He gave the first in a series of lectures, now known as the Landon Lecture Series, at Kansas State University. Landon lived to the age of 100 and died in Topeka, Kansas, in 1987. His daughter, Nancy Kassebaum, represented Kansas in the United States Senate from 1978 to 1997.

==Early life and education==
Alfred Mossman Landon was born on September 9, 1887, in West Middlesex, Pennsylvania, the son of Anne Mossman and John Manuel Landon. Landon grew up in Marietta, Ohio. He moved with his family to Kansas at age 17 and graduated from the University of Kansas in 1908. Landon first pursued a career in banking, but in 1912 he became an independent petroleum producer in Independence, Kansas. During World War I, he joined the Army and was selected for assignment as an officer. He was commissioned in the Chemical Corps and attained the rank of captain. He was preparing to depart for France when the Armistice ended the war, so he was discharged and returned to Kansas.

By 1929, Landon&#x27;s career in the oil industry had made him a millionaire, and he was instrumental in the establishment of the Kansas-Oklahoma division of the United States Oil and Gas Association, then known as the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, a petroleum lobbying organization.

Landon was married to Margaret Fleming until her death in 1918.

==Career==
Landon supported Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Progressive Party in 1912, and by 1922, was private secretary to the governor of Kansas. He later became known as the leader of the liberal Republicans in the state. He was elected chairman of the Republican state central committee in 1928 and directed the successful Republican presidential and gubernatorial campaigns in Kansas in that year.

In 1930, however, incumbent Republican Kansas governor Clyde M. Reed failed to gain renomination, as he was defeated by challenger Frank Haucke, who would later go on to lose the general election to Harry H. Woodring. The election left the Kansas Republican Party damaged and divided. Landon decided to run in 1932 as a candidate who would reunite the Kansas GOP, and he won the nomination.

Landon was elected Governor of Kansas in the general election, where he defeated both the incumbent Democrat Woodring and independent challenger John R. Brinkley in a closely contested race. He was re-elected governor in 1934, over Democrat Omar B. Ketchum (whose campaign was directed by Clyde Short); Gov. Frank Merriam of California and Landon were the only Republican governors in the nation to be re-elected that year. As governor, Landon gained a reputation for reducing taxes and balancing the budget. Landon is often described as a fiscal conservative who nevertheless believed that government must also address certain social issues. He supported parts of the New Deal and labor unions. Later in life, Landon would come out against Right-to-Work laws. Landon was opposed to segregation. When newly elected black party officials asked where their office space would be, Landon responded with &quot;Right here with the rest of us.&quot;

During the 1932 presidential campaign, a degree of animosity developed between Landon and then U.S. President Herbert Hoover. Osro Cobb of Arkansas, a friend of both men, tried to bring about a reconciliation, as he explains in his memoirs:

During his gubernatorial years, Landon attempted to address the needs of his Depression-battered state while still advancing the Republican Party. After his speech at the Cleveland convention in 1936, Landon stated, &quot;My chief concern in this crisis is to see the Republican Party name its strongest possible candidate and a man that would be a good president.&quot; During the election year, Landon called for a &quot;special session of the Legislature to enact measures to bring Kansas within the requirements of the federal social security program.&quot;

===1936 presidential election===
In 1936, Landon sought the Republican presidential nomination opposing the re-election of Roosevelt. At the 1936 Republican National Convention, Landon&#x27;s campaign manager John Hamilton mobilized the younger elements of the party against the faction led by Herbert Hoover. Landon won the nomination on the first ballot; the convention selected Chicago newspaper publisher (and Roosevelt&#x27;s future Secretary of the Navy) Frank Knox as his running mate.

Landon proved to be an ineffective campaigner who rarely traveled. Most of the attacks on Roosevelt and Social Security were developed by Republican campaigners rather than Landon himself. In the two months after his nomination he made no campaign appearances. As columnist Westbrook Pegler lampooned, &quot;Considerable mystery surrounds the disappearance of Alfred M. Landon of Topeka, Kansas ... The Missing Persons Bureau has sent out an alarm bulletin bearing Mr. Landon&#x27;s photograph and other particulars, and anyone having information of his whereabouts is asked to communicate direct with the Republican National Committee.&quot;

Landon respected and admired Roosevelt and accepted much of the New Deal but objected that it was hostile to business and involved too much waste and inefficiency. Late in the campaign, Landon accused Roosevelt of corruption – that is, of acquiring so much power that he was subverting the Constitution. Landon said:

The 1936 presidential election was extraordinarily lopsided. Although Landon accrued nearly seventeen million votes and obtained the endorsement of track star Jesse Owens, he lost the popular vote by more than 10 million votes. He lost his home state of Kansas and carried only Maine and Vermont for a total of eight electoral votes to Roosevelt&#x27;s 523. On the same day, Republicans lost control of the Kansas governorship, as Democrat Walter A. Huxman was elected as his successor as governor. FDR&#x27;s win was the most lopsided electoral victory since the 1820 election. The overwhelming Roosevelt victory prompted Democratic National Committee chair James Farley to jokingly update the political maxim &quot;As Maine goes, so goes the nation&quot; to &quot;As Maine goes, so goes Vermont&quot;.

==Later life==
Following his defeat, Landon finished out his term as Governor of Kansas and returned to the oil industry. Landon did not seek elected office again.

In 1938, he spoke out in defense of the First Amendment rights of one his 1936 opponents, Norman Thomas. Mayor Frank Hague, a close FDR ally, had forced Thomas to leave Jersey City after he attempted to speak at a rally for free speech. The two men struck up a lifetime friendship. Landon hoped that the incident would &quot;draw together all those who have common ideals of freedom and tolerance&quot; and pledged to stand &quot;shoulder to shoulder with you in this fight for free speech.&quot; Landon&#x27;s comments portrayed the New Deal and Hague, as closely aligned threats to free speech.

The Republicans&#x27; defeats in 1932 and 1936 plunged their party into a period of bitter intra-party strife. Landon played an important role in ending this internal bickering in 1938 by helping to prepare a new group of leaders for the presidential campaign of 1940, and in trying to bring about a compromise between the isolationist and internationalist viewpoints in foreign policy. Landon was in the American delegation led by Secretary of State Cordell Hull to the 1938 Pan-American Conference in Lima, Peru. However, Landon declined a position in Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Cabinet because he made his acceptance contingent upon the President&#x27;s renunciation of a third term.

After war broke out in Europe in 1939, Landon fought against isolationists such as America First Committee who supported the Neutrality Act; he feared it would mislead Nazi Germany into thinking the United States was unwilling to fight. In 1941, however, he joined isolationists in arguing against lend-lease, although he did urge that United Kingdom be given $5 billion outright instead.

After the war, he backed the Marshall Plan, while opposing high domestic spending. After the communist revolution in China, he was one of the first to advocate recognition of Mao Zedong&#x27;s communist government, and its admission to the United Nations, when this was still a very unpopular position among the leadership and followers of both major parties.

In 1961, Landon urged the United States to join the European Common Market. In November 1962, when he was asked to describe his political philosophy, Landon said: &quot;I would say practical progressive, which means that the Republican party or any political party has got to recognize the problems of a growing and complex industrial civilization. And I don&#x27;t think the Republican party is really wide awake to that.&quot; Later in the 1960s, Landon backed President Lyndon Johnson on Medicare and other Great Society programs.

On December 13, 1966, Landon gave his first &quot;Landon Lecture&quot; at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas. Landon&#x27;s lecture, titled &quot;New Challenges in International Relations&quot; was the first in a series of public issues lectures that continues to this day and has featured numerous world leaders and political figures, including seven U.S. presidents (Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush).

Landon addressed the Republican National Convention in 1976 in Kansas City.

==Final year==

President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy attended Landon&#x27;s hundredth birthday party at his home in Topeka. Describing Landon as &quot;the living soul of Kansas&quot;, the 76-year old-Reagan remarked, &quot;You don&#x27;t know what a joy it is for a fella like me to go to a birthday party for someone who can, in all honesty, call me a kid.&quot; Landon, standing with the use of a walking stick, told the President and well-wishers at the party, &quot;It&#x27;s a great day in my life. And it&#x27;s a great day in the lives of all of us to have had the privilege that we have today of meeting with the President of the United States and Mrs. Reagan.&quot; White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker married Landon&#x27;s daughter Nancy nine years later.

Nine days after his birthday, Landon was hospitalized at Stormant-Vail Regional Medical Center after complaining of internal pain. He was treated for a gallstone and a mild case of bronchitis and returned home on October 10.
Landon died in Topeka on October 12, 1987, at 5:25 p.m., thirty-three days after celebrating his hundredth birthday, and is interred at Mount Hope Cemetery in Topeka. At the time of his death, he was survived by his second wife, Theo Cobb.

==Family==
On January 7, 1915, Landon married Margaret Fleming of Oil City, Pennsylvania. They had one son and one daughter, both of whom they named after themselves, but the marriage only lasted three years, until the senior Margaret&#x27;s death in 1918. The junior Alf died a week after birth. Landon then &quot;devoted himself to managing his oil interests and raising his young daughter&quot;, remaining unmarried until January 15, 1930, when he married Theo Cobb, of Topeka, Kansas. They had one son and one daughter. Theo preferred to stay at home and raise the children rather than engaging in her husband&#x27;s political efforts, later quipping about the 1936 presidential election that &quot;Mrs. Roosevelt was doing enough traveling for both of us&quot;. Theo outlived Landon by nine years, dying in Topeka on July 21, 1996, at the age of 97.

Landon&#x27;s daughter, Nancy Landon Kassebaum, was a United States Senator from Kansas. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1978, she was re-elected in 1984 and 1990. Her second husband was her former Senate colleague Howard Henry Baker Jr., of Tennessee (1925–2014). Landon&#x27;s nephew was actor Hal Landon Jr.

<doc id="104468" wikidata="Q747113" url="?curid=104468" title="Hitler Has Only Got One Ball">
<text>&quot;Hitler Has Only Got One Ball&quot;, sometimes known as &quot;The River Kwai March&quot;, is a World War II British song, the lyrics of which, sung to the tune of the World War I-era &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot;, impugn the masculinity of Nazi leaders by alleging they had missing, deformed, or undersized testicles. Multiple variant lyrics exist, but the most common version refers to rumours that Adolf Hitler had monorchism (&quot;one ball&quot;), and accuses Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler of microorchidism (&quot;two but very small&quot;) and Joseph Goebbels of anorchia (&quot;no balls at all&quot;). An alternative version suggests Hitler&#x27;s missing testicle is displayed as a war trophy in the Royal Albert Hall.

The author of the lyrics is unknown, though several claims have been made. The song first appeared among British soldiers in 1939 and was quickly taken up by Allied military and civilians. Its familiarity increased after its use in a scene in the 1957 film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;. The song has been cited as an example of morally-correct disrespect that used political mockery to boost morale in wartime.

== Lyrics ==


The best known stanza consists of the following quatrain:
The opening line is a reference to widespread rumours that Adolf Hitler had monorchism (&quot;one ball&quot; meaning one testicle). The second and third lines similarly attack Luftwaffe chief Hermann Göring and SS chief Heinrich Himmler by suggesting they had microorchidism (&quot;very small&quot; testicles).
In the fourth line, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels&#x27;s name is often mispronounced &quot;go-balls&quot; so that it rhymes with the accusation of anorchia (&quot;no balls&quot; meaning no testicles).

== Analysis ==
The lyrics attack Nazi leaders&#x27; masculinity by mocking and belittling their alleged testicular deformities.
University of Kent psychology professor Janet Sayers wrote that the song was a response by the Allies to the use of &quot;male fantasy&quot; in Nazi propaganda. 
According to Brian O. Murdoch, a philologist with the University of Stirling, a notable aspect of the lyrics is that they attack enemy leaders, but not the enemy in general.
Folklorist Greg Kelley of the University of Guelph-Humber wrote:
According to Kelley, in claiming that Hitler had only one testicle, the opening line suggests that Hitler had less than the normal amount of sexual prowess and, symbolically, courage.
Mad studies scholar Richard A. Ingram wrote that the accusation of monorchidism in the song alluded to the theory that monorchidism caused Hitler to be insane, in the same way that lone nut&#x27; retains the idea of a causal relationship between monotesticularity and madness.&quot; 
Jason Lee of De Montfort University wrote, &quot;Just as Shakespeare used a disability based on some fact to construct Richard III&#x27;s character, in the case of Hitler disability is equated with not just moral weakness but evil.&quot;
University of Stirling philosophy professor Rowan Cruft describes the song as an example of morally-appropriate disrespect, writing &quot;Hitler&#x27;s actions made it morally correct to show him disrespect&quot; by singing the song.

All known versions of the original verse end with &quot;no balls at all&quot;. According to Kelley, &quot;in this musical catalogue of testicular disorders, the definitive last entry is always anorchismthe physical signifier of a lack of courage or character.&quot;

Southern Illinois University Edwardsville philosophy professor Greg Littmann writes that the song is an example of political mockery used to build a &quot;fighting spirit&quot;.
Maria Curie-Skłodowska University lecturer Joanna Jabłońska-Hood describes the song as using comedy to attack the masculinity of Nazi leaders, turning them from symbols of strength to objects of pity. According to Jabłońska-Hood, the apparent contradiction of high-ranking Nazi leaders being pitied mirrors the juxtaposition of the cheerful, upbeat tune of Colonel Bogey March with the &quot;grim subject&quot; of the lyrics.
University of Nottingham music professor Mervyn Cooke describes the tune as &quot;reflect[ing] the moods of humour in adversity and pride in the resilience of the underdog&quot;.

== Other versions ==

Additional British verses ran:
In addition to the common reference to Hitler&#x27;s rumoured monorchidism, these versions suggest he was abused by his mother, and that Hitler&#x27;s severed testicle ultimately became a war trophy on public display in the Royal Albert Hall. Variations of the &quot;Albert Hall&quot; lyrics were still sung by schoolchildren in the London neighbourhoods of Finsbury in 1983 and Kensington in 1984. Regional variations found in other areas of the United Kingdom use (for example) Ulster Hall (Northern Ireland), Kelvin Hall (Glasgow), Free Trade Hall (Manchester), and Leeds Town Hall (Leeds).

After Hitler&#x27;s death at the end of World War II, later versions changed the first line to the past-tense: &quot;Hitler, he only had one ball&quot;. 
Other postwar variations of the first line included &quot;only one big ball&quot;, &quot;only one brass ball&quot; and &quot;only one left ball&quot; (which latter folklorist Greg Kelley of the University of Guelph-Humber calls &quot;a curious description, given that having one left testicle is considered the norm&quot;). Another variation, &quot;only one meat ball&quot;, emerged in the mid-1940s after The Andrews Sisters version &quot;One Meat Ball&quot;.
Some variants used by children replace &quot;Go-balls&quot; with a mispronunciation of &quot;Goebels&quot;,or a fictional character, &quot;Joe Balls&quot;.

== Second verse ==

According to folklorist Greg Kelley of the University of Guelph-Humber, there is a less common second verse:
Erwin Rommel, the decorated German field marshal known as the &quot;Desert Fox&quot;, who was more respected (or at least less hated) than the Nazi officials named in the first verse, is implied to be hypermasculine by virtue of having extra testicles (polyorchidism).

This verse&#x27;s second line is a reference to the mystery surrounding the capture and imprisonment in 1941 of Hitler&#x27;s deputy, Rudolf Hess. Hess secretly flew to Scotland to attempt to negotiate a peace treaty, but was arrested by the British and imprisoned for life.

The third line is an American addition referencing German boxer Max Schmeling, whose success was touted by Nazi propaganda as evincing Aryan superiority.
Schmeling was defeated in 1938 by African-American boxer Joe Louis, &quot;letting out a high-pitched cry&quot; when Louis landed a decisive punch. This &quot;yell heard around the world&quot; became a symbol of American victory over Nazism.

== Origin ==
An adaptation of the World War I-era &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot;, &quot;Hitler Has Only Got One Ball&quot; first appeared among British troops in 1939.
The exact origins of the lyrics (which are listed as number 10,493 in the Roud Folk Song Index) are unknown, and though there have been several claims of authorship there have apparently been no attempts to claim copyright.

Author Donough O&#x27;Brien stated in his autobiography that his father, Toby O&#x27;Brien, then a publicist for the British Council, wrote the lyrics in August 1939 to be used as wartime propaganda.
The version purportedly authored by O&#x27;Brien begins &quot;Göring has only got one ball, Hitler had two but very small&quot;, while almost all other versions have the order reversed (&quot;Hitler has only got one ball, Göring had two but very small&quot;).

British composer and broadcaster Hubert Gregg claimed to have written the lyrics and submitted them anonymously to the British War Office to be used as wartime propaganda.

According to folklorist Greg Kelley of the University of Guelph-Humber, such claims by O&#x27;Brien and Gregg are &quot;dubious&quot;governments rarely use humour as propaganda because such efforts are largely unsuccessful. 
According to Kelley, another possible explanation for the song&#x27;s origin is that the lyrics developed organically from the difficulty English speakers had pronouncing Goebbels&#x27;s name (in the song, &quot;Goebbels&quot; is mispronounced &quot;go-balls&quot;).

In his purportedly factual 2001 BBC radio play &quot;Dear Dr. Goebbels&quot;, British screenwriter Neville Smith suggested that an undercover MI6 agent in Germany named Philip Morgenstern wrote the lyrics and used the song as a means to transmit intelligence to Britain concerning private details about Joseph Goebbels (the last line of the adaptation&#x27;s first verse is &quot;But poor old Goebbels has no balls at all&quot;).

Brian O. Murdoch, a philologist with the University of Stirling, wrote that the adaptation was an oral composition that likely originated in London. 
Murdoch stated that the opening line may have originated from various folk sources, such as the Irish ballad Sam Hall (which, in some versions, includes the lyric &quot;Oh my name it is Sam Hall / and I&#x27;ve only got one ball&quot;).

According to Scottish poet Alan Bold, the last line may have been influenced by an earlier song called &quot;No Balls At All&quot;, itself a parody of an Air Force song called &quot;No Bombs At All&quot;, which in turn was a parody of a song about women&#x27;s clothing called &quot;Nothing to Wear&quot;.

== &quot;River Kwai&quot; and post-war legacy ==
After World War II, the song (and the debate about Hitler&#x27;s monorchism) remained in common parlance. 
Its use in David Lean&#x27;s 1957 film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; led to the Mitch Miller band recording a best-selling version under the title &quot;The River Kwai March&quot;. 
In Lean&#x27;s early conception of the film, Allied soldiers in a Japanese prison camp would sing the song as an act of defiance. 
But after the widow of the composer of &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot; objected to the bawdy lyrics, Lean decided that if the soldiers simply whistled the tune the audience would supply the lyrics mentally. 
Since then the song has been the subject of numerous cultural references, both comedic and controversial.

When, in 1980, The King&#x27;s Own Calgary Regiment Band played the &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot; (its official march) during a visit to Canada by Japan&#x27;s prime minister, it was perceived as an insult to Japan,
but in 2007 the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Seventh Fleet Band played the tune in Japan without apparent objection.

The song appears in the satirical comic book limited series &quot;Adventures in the Rifle Brigade&quot; (2000), by Garth Ennis and Carlos Ezquerra, and the severed testicle is the main MacGuffin of its sequel, aptly named &quot;Operation Bollock&quot; (2001–2002).

A 2003 advertisement for Spitfire ale showed a picture of Hitler in military uniform with the caption &quot;Spot the ball&quot;. 
In 2007, &quot;The Armstrong and Miller Show&quot; aired a comedy sketch mocking theories that the song had originated as a British intelligence report. In the sketch, a military officer reads the incoming report, which an intelligence agent describes as &quot;possibly the single biggest intelligence coup of the war&quot; (brackets in the original):
In the 2010s, the video game series &quot;Sniper Elite&quot; alluded to the song by including the ability to shoot off Hitler&#x27;s single testicle with a rifle.

At the 2016 Winnipeg Comedy Festival, comedian Lara Rae referenced the song in a joke about the dangers of cats being neutered by non-professionals who might not complete the task: &quot;It might start out okay, but you really have to finish the job. A cat with no balls is mellow; a cat with one ball is Hitler.&quot;

A 2019 episode of the American television series &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; shares its title with the song and features a scene in which it is sung.

In the 2024 television series Monsieur Spade &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot; is whistled at the end of episode 4, the beginning of episode 5 and the end of episode 6 as a way to animate the protagonist, an Algerian boy savant named Zaid, and motivate him to continue his journey. 

In Germany, the song has been used in advertisements for the digestif Underberg, and in Japan, where it has been used in game shows and children&#x27;s shows. Thomas Jefferson School of Law professor Aaron Schwabach described the song&#x27;s appropriation not just by Britain&#x27;s allies but also by its former enemies, whom the lyrics attack, as a form of &quot;cultural transformation&quot; that is &quot;an essential tool of cultural survival in a global era&quot;.

According to folklorist Greg Kelley of the University of Guelph-Humber, these comedic references have been effective for nearly a century after the war engendering theories of Hitler&#x27;s actual monorchism in the public consciousness.

<doc id="104476" wikidata="Q3233993" url="?curid=104476" title="Smothers Brothers">
<text>The Smothers Brothers were the American duo of brothers Tom and Dick Smothers, who performed folk singing, music, and comedy. The brothers&#x27; trademark double act was performing folk songs (Tommy on acoustic guitar, Dick on double bass), which usually led to arguments between them. Tommy&#x27;s signature line was &quot;Mom always liked you best!&quot; Tommy (the elder of the two) acted &quot;slow&quot; and Dick, the straight man, acted &quot;superior&quot;.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the brothers frequently appeared on television variety shows and issued several popular record albums of their stage performances. Their own television variety show, &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, became one of the most controversial American TV programs of the Vietnam War era. Despite popular success, the brothers&#x27; (especially Tom&#x27;s) penchant for material that was critical of the political mainstream and sympathetic to the emerging counterculture led to their firing by the CBS network in 1969. One episode was left unaired.

The brothers continued to work, both independently and as a team, on stage and television, and in films during subsequent decades.

==Early years==
The brothers were both born on Governors Island in New York Harbor, where their father, Thomas B. Smothers Jr., a West Point graduate and U.S. Army officer, was stationed. Tom was born on February 2, 1937, and Dick was born on November 20, 1938. Major Smothers served in the 45th Infantry Regiment and died during World War II, while being transported from a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Fukuoka, Japan, to a POW camp in Mukden, Manchukuo. They were raised by their mother in the Los Angeles area.

They graduated from Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California, and attended San Jose State University. After a brief time in a folk group called the Casual Quintet, the brothers made their first professional appearance as a duo in February 1959 at The Purple Onion in San Francisco. They were a popular act in clubs and released several successful top 40 albums for Mercury Records, the most successful being &quot;Curb Your Tongue, Knave!&quot; in 1964. Their first national television appearance was on &quot;The Jack Paar Show&quot; on January 28, 1961. On October 6, 1963, the Smothers Brothers made an appearance on the CBS variety series &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; which also showcased Barbra Streisand. Tom and Dick inherited Garland&#x27;s time slot when their own variety series began in early 1967.

The brothers appeared in a segment of the television series &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, in 1964, in which they played two compulsive hoarders. Their first television series was a situation comedy, &quot;The Smothers Brothers Show&quot; (1965–1966), produced by Four Star Television. Tom played an angel come back to earth to oversee his brother Dick, who played a swinging bachelor. It did not do well in the ratings and had little of the music that was identified with the brothers. Tom said in 1969 that &quot;Four Star gave me ulcers.&quot;

==&quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;==
===History===

&quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; started out as only a slightly &quot;hip&quot; version of the typical comedy-variety show of its era, but rapidly evolved into a show that extended the boundaries of what was considered permissible in television satire at that time. While the Smothers themselves were at the forefront of these efforts, credit also goes to the roster of writers and regular performers they brought to the show, including Steve Martin, Don Novello, Rob Reiner, presidential candidate Pat Paulsen, Bob Einstein, Albert Brooks, and resident hippie Leigh French. The show also introduced audiences to pop singer Jennifer Warnes (originally billed as Jennifer Warren or simply Jennifer), who was a regular on the series. The television premiere of Mason Williams&#x27; hit record, &quot;Classical Gas&quot;, took place on the show; Williams was also the head writer for the series.

===Musical guests===
The series showcased new musical artists to whom other comedy-variety shows rarely gave airtime, due to the nature of their music or their political affiliations. George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Joan Baez, Buffalo Springfield, Cass Elliot, Harry Belafonte, Cream, Donovan, The Doors, Glen Campbell, Janis Ian, Jefferson Airplane, The Happenings, Peter, Paul and Mary, Spanky and Our Gang, Steppenwolf, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, The Hollies, The Who, the original broadway cast of Hair and even Pete Seeger were showcased on the show, despite the advertiser-sensitive nature of their music.

Seeger&#x27;s appearance was his first appearance on network television since being blacklisted in the 1950s. It became controversial because of his song choice, &quot;Waist Deep in the Big Muddy&quot;, an anti-war song that the network considered to be an insult to President Lyndon Johnson and his Vietnam War policy. The song was censored on Seeger&#x27;s first appearance but permitted on a later appearance.

In September 1968, the show broadcast in successive weeks &quot;music videos&quot; (called &quot;promotional films&quot; at the time) for The Beatles&#x27; double A-side single &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot;. Before a rowdy crowd at the Los Angeles Forum, Jimi Hendrix dedicated &quot;I Don&#x27;t Live Today&quot; to the Smothers Brothers, as heard on &quot;The Jimi Hendrix Box Set&quot;.

===The Who incident===
The performance by the Who in 1967 was another defining moment in the series. As the group often did during that period, the Who destroyed their instruments at the conclusion of their performance of &quot;My Generation&quot;, with the usual addition of mild explosives for light pyrotechnic effect. The piece ended with guitarist Pete Townshend grabbing Tommy&#x27;s guitar and smashing it. On the &quot;Smothers Brothers&quot; show that night a small amount of explosive was put into the small cannon that Keith Moon kept in his bass drum. But it did not go off during the rehearsal. Unbeknownst to Moon, a stage hand had added another explosive before the taping, and later Moon added another charge so that now there were three explosive charges in the cannon instead of one. When Moon detonated it, the explosion was so intense that a piece of cymbal shrapnel cut into Moon&#x27;s arm; Moon is heard moaning in pain toward the end of the piece. Townshend, who had been in front of Moon&#x27;s drums at the time, had his hair singed by the blast; he is seen putting out sparks in his hair before finishing the sketch with a visibly shocked Tommy Smothers. The blast contributed heavily to Townshend&#x27;s long-term hearing loss.

===Controversies and cancellation===
With its focus having evolved toward a more youth-oriented one, the show became both popular and controversial. Three specific targets of satire – racism, the President of the United States, and the Vietnam War – wound up defining the show&#x27;s content for the remainder of its run, eventually leading to its demise. However, contrary to popular belief, the brothers did not agree politically, with Tom being the one having more intention to challenge the political establishment; he even later described his younger brother as &quot;more conservative politically.&quot;

The brothers soon found themselves in regular conflict with CBS&#x27;s network censors. At the start of the 1968–69 season, the network ordered that the Smothers Brothers deliver their shows finished and ready to air 10 days before air date so that the censors could edit the shows as necessary. In the season premiere, CBS deleted the entire segment of Belafonte singing &quot;Lord, Don&#x27;t Stop the Carnival&quot; against a backdrop of the havoc during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, along with two lines from a satire of their main competitor, &quot;Bonanza&quot;. As the year progressed, battles over content continued, including a David Steinberg sermon about Moses and the Burning Bush.

With some local stations making their own deletions of controversial skits or comments, the continuing problems over the show came to a head after CBS broadcast a rerun on March 9, 1969. The network explained the decision by stating that, because that week&#x27;s episode did not arrive in time to be previewed, it would not be shown. In that program, Joan Baez paid tribute to her then-husband, David Harris, who was entering prison after refusing military service, while comedian Jackie Mason made a joke about children &quot;playing doctor&quot;. When the show finally did air, two months later, the network allowed Baez to state that her husband was in prison, but edited out the reason.

Despite the conflict, the show was picked up for the 1969-70 season on March 14, seemingly ending the debate over its status. However, network CEO and President William S. Paley abruptly cancelled the show on April 4, 1969. The reason given by CBS was the brothers’ refusal to meet the pre-air delivery dates as specified by the network in order to accommodate review by the censors. This cancellation led the brothers to file a successful breach of contract suit against the network, although the suit failed to see the brothers or their show returned to the air. Despite this cancellation, the show went on to win the Emmy Award that year for best writing. The saga of the cancellation of the show is the subject of a 2002 documentary film, &quot;Smothered&quot;.

==Later career and retirement==

The Smothers Brothers starred in several other television shows. These included a 1968 CBS summer replacement series, &quot;The Summer Brothers Smothers Show&quot;; a 1970 ABC summer series, &quot;The Return of the Smothers Brothers&quot;; an NBC series called &quot;The Smothers Brothers Show&quot; (1975), initially produced by Joe Hamilton (who concurrently produced &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, starring his wife), which was an unsuccessful attempt to recapture the look and feel of the original comedy-variety series without the controversy; and &quot;The Tom and Dick Smothers Brothers Specials I and II&quot; in 1980.

In February 1970, &quot;The Return of the Smothers Brothers&quot; aired. The hour-long special was written by Tom Smothers, David Steinberg, and Bob Einstein. Guests included Peter Fonda and Glen Campbell.

In 1978, the brothers starred in a replacement cast for &quot;I Love My Wife&quot;, Cy Coleman&#x27;s and Michael Stewart&#x27;s Broadway musical satire on the sexual revolution of the 1970s, directed by Gene Saks.

In 1981, Tom and Dick Smothers played non-brothers in a light TV drama, set in San Francisco, titled &quot;Fitz and Bones&quot;. Both characters worked at a Bay Area television station; Tom played cameraman Bones Howard and Dick played Ryan Fitzpatrick, an investigative reporter. The show was cancelled after five episodes.
In 1985 they guest-starred as themselves on &quot;Benson&quot; season 6, episode 17 &quot;Solid Gold&quot;.

The pair starred in the Cinemax Comedy Experiment &quot;Rap Master Ronnie,&quot; a film version of Garry Trudeau and Elizabeth Swados&#x27; off-Broadway play. In 1989, they also appeared in the box office flop &quot;Speed Zone&quot; aka &quot;Cannonball Fever&quot; co-starring John Candy, Peter Boyle, and Donna Dixon.

In 1988, Tom and Dick reunited with CBS for a special celebrating the 20th anniversary of their variety show (though their show premiered in 1967, which made it their 21st anniversary). The brothers used the special to pay tribute to their network and also poke fun at it for cancelling them 19 years earlier. Several of their former writers, including Steve Martin, Rob Reiner, and Mason Williams appeared as guests, as did former series regulars such as Jennifer Warnes and Glen Campbell. The success of the special led to &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; (1988–1989). This show began production during a 1988 Writers Guild of America strike as the WGA had agreed to settle with the show&#x27;s producer and grant the show an exemption from the strike and allow writers to go back to work for the series.

1988 also marked the release of &quot;The Yo Yo Man Instructional Video&quot;, a VHS release in which Tom&#x27;s non-speaking &quot;Yo-Yo Man&quot; character, who appeared as early as the 1960s, guides viewers through basic yo-yo moves. The video sold over 200,000 copies.

In 2004, they guest starred on Bonnie Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Life With Bonnie&quot;.

The brothers have worked independently as well; Dick has appeared as an actor in films, including a rare dramatic role as a Nevada state senator in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Casino&quot;. Tom appeared in the 2005 made-for-television movie &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot;.

They appeared in the documentary &quot;The Aristocrats&quot; in 2005, and had separate cameos in the 2009 film &quot;The Informant!&quot; In December 2009, the duo guest starred in a 21st-season episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; that also featured Cooper, Peyton, and Eli Manning.

After more than 51 years of touring, the Smothers Brothers officially announced their retirement from touring during their final performance at the Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Sunday May 16, 2010. The affair was kept low key with some family members and friends in attendance.

On July 22, 2019, the Smothers Brothers made their first official appearance together in almost a decade at a charity event held at McCurdy&#x27;s Comedy Theater in Sarasota, Florida. Though not a proper performance, they spoke about their careers and answered audience questions. The duo donated much of their archives and artifacts from their career to the National Comedy Center a week later and appeared at the Chautauqua Institution to discuss the 50th anniversary of the cancellation of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;.

The Smothers Brothers made several appearances in 2022. On the December 11, 2022, episode of &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;, the brothers announced that they would be going on tour in 2023. However, the tour was cancelled and Tom Smothers announced in July 2023 that he was diagnosed with stage 2 lung cancer. He died on December 26, 2023, at the age of 86.

Tom Smothers, along with his wife Marcy Carriker, operated the Remick Ridge Vineyards (Remick was the maiden name of Smothers&#x27; mother) in Sonoma County, California.

==Awards==
In 2003, the brothers were awarded the George Carlin Freedom of Expression Award from the Video Software Dealers&#x27; Association. The award was in recognition of the brothers&#x27; &quot;extraordinary comic gifts and their unfailing support of the First Amendment&quot;. In the same year, they both received Honorary Doctorate Degrees from San Jose State University. The Boston Comedy Festival presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to the brothers in 2008.

In September 2008, during the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards, Tommy Smothers, a lead writer of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, was belatedly awarded a 1968 Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Comedic Series. The award was presented to him by Steve Martin, one of the show&#x27;s original writers. In 1968, Tommy Smothers had refused to let his name be on the list of writers nominated for the Emmy because he felt his name was too controversial, and thus when the writing staff won he was the only member not to receive the award.

The Smothers Brothers were inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2010. They were given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1989.

On June 18, 2022, the Smothers Brothers received the Johnny Carson Comedy Legend Award at the conclusion of the Great American Comedy Festival in Norfolk, Nebraska.

<text>Thomas Bolyn Smothers III (February 2, 1937 – December 26, 2023) was an American comedian, actor, composer, and musician, widely known as half of the musical comedy duo the Smothers Brothers, alongside his younger brother Dick. In the 1960s they were known for their network comedy and variety shows, &quot;The Smothers Brothers Show&quot; and &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;.

Smothers and John Lennon played acoustic guitar during the live recording of Lennon&#x27;s 1969 song &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;.

==Early life==
Thomas Bolyn Smothers III was born on February 2, 1937, at the Fort Jay army post hospital on Governors Island in New York City, the son of Ruth (&quot;née&quot; Remick), a homemaker, and Major Thomas B. Smothers, a United States Army officer who died a POW of the Japanese in April 1945. The younger Smothers later grew up in Altadena, Tujunga, and Redondo Beach, California. 

As a child, Smothers played guitar and piano by ear due to difficulty reading sheet music; Smothers would be diagnosed with dyslexia at age 31. Beginning in fifth grade, he played guitar in bands formed with friends and began incorporating humor with his music and in-school interactions. Athletically, he grew up competing in gymnastics.

Smothers first attended Verdugo Hills High School before transferring to Redondo Union High School as a senior. At Redondo Beach, he and his brother sang in the school&#x27;s madrigal choir, Tom as a bass and Dick as a tenor; Tom graduated from Redondo Union in 1955. Smothers then enrolled at San Jose State College (now San Jose State University) in 1956 as an advertising major and competed at pole vault on the track team as a freshman in 1956–57. Then in 1957–58, Smothers competed on the gymnastics team, where he tied for first place on the parallel bars at the 1958 State College Gymnastics Championships.

==Career==
Inspired by the popularity of The Kingston Trio&#x27;s &quot;Tom Dooley&quot;, the Smothers Brothers initially wanted to be folk musicians. 

After Dick transferred to San Jose State in 1957, Tom and Dick began performing music at San Jose nightclubs, with audiences mostly of other college students. In January 1959, the Smothers brothers were discovered by a detective who became their first manager and invited them to an audition at the Purple Onion, a nightclub in San Francisco. The following month, the brothers left San Jose State to focus full-time on working in entertainment, after the Purple Onion asked them to substitute for other acts who were ill. Their show was so successful that the Purple Onion extended their original two-week contract to 16 weeks; the brothers returned to the Purple Onion for another 16-week contract after playing a Lake Tahoe club in the summer of 1959.

In February 1960, the Smothers Brothers made their professional debut at Aspen, Colorado. Tom recalled in 2006 interview:

Tom&#x27;s first foray into the medium of television was as a regular on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; in 1961. He followed that role with a single episode of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;.

The Smothers Brothers next appeared on the CBS sitcom &quot;The Smothers Brothers Show&quot; from 1965 to 1966. Tom felt that the show did not play to the brothers&#x27; strengths and wanted creative control over their next venture.

===&quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; and aftermath===

Tom Smothers negotiated creative control over their next CBS show, a variety show titled &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; in 1967. The brothers had conflicts with the CBS standards and practices department with jokes about religion, recreational drugs, sex, and the Vietnam War, topics considered taboo on primetime television of the era. The brothers&#x27; political action on the air led to their show&#x27;s demise, with David Steinberg later claiming &quot;The most innovative variety show on television shut down because of political pressure.&quot; In 2006, Tom revealed that he and his brother actually disagreed on politics. During the same years, Tom recorded mainstream songs, such as &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love with You&quot;. Tom later stated, &quot;When the Smothers Brothers came on the air we had no political point of view or social consciousness, it just evolved as the show was on the air.&quot;

===Rock and Roll, &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;===
Smothers introduced some musical acts at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. As he became more politically active, he befriended similarly inclined celebrities like John Lennon.

In 1969, Smothers and Lennon played acoustic guitars on Lennon&#x27;s recording of his single &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; (Smothers&#x27; name was also mentioned in the song). The song was written and performed during Lennon&#x27;s and Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Bed-in&quot; honeymoon on June 1, 1969, in Room 1742 at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Smothers can be seen in the hotel room in the 1988 documentary film &quot;&quot;.

===Political involvement===

After &quot;Comedy Hour&quot; was canceled, Smothers became outspoken in politics.

In the 1970s, Smothers mocked Bill Cosby for not taking a stand on political issues of the day, such as civil rights.

In October 1976, Cosby and Smothers attended a Playboy Mansion party. The tension between the two culminated in Cosby punching Smothers in the head.

Smothers&#x27;s politics were in marked contrast to those of his brother Dick, whom Tom described as &quot;more conservative&quot;. Tom publicly criticized Democratic president Lyndon B. Johnson and his involvement in and perpetuation of the Vietnam War. Tom stated in 2006 that the duo&#x27;s real-life political and philosophical differences were a key part of their ability to maintain their act for as long as they did.

===Film roles===
In motion pictures, Smothers portrayed corporate-executive-turned-tap-dancing-magician Donald Beeman in Brian De Palma&#x27;s 1972 film, &quot;Get to Know Your Rabbit&quot;. He also played a banker in &quot;Silver Bears&quot;. He later portrayed Reverend Spike in &quot;Serial&quot; (1980).

In 1973, he voiced Ted E. Bear (Theodore Edward Bear) in the DePatie-Freleng NBC animated Christmas special &quot;The Bear Who Slept Through Christmas&quot;. Ten years later, he voiced Ted E. Bear again for its Halloween sequel &quot;The Great Bear Scare&quot;.

In 1980, Smothers starred in the film &quot;There Goes the Bride&quot;. In 1982, he played with an ensemble cast in &quot;Pandemonium&quot; in which he was a brave Canadian Mountie chasing down a serial killer at a cheerleader camp. In 1983 he appeared in an episode of the UK TV series &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;. He also voiced one of the characters in the cartoon Christmas movie &quot;Precious Moments: Timmy&#x27;s Special Delivery&quot; in 1993.

===Later work===

The Smothers Brothers hosted the NBC sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1982, with a parody of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; as its opening sketch, with Tom playing Johnny Carson, interviewing Dick. The sketch derailed after Tom (in character as Johnny) tried to goad Dick into talking more about Tom.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the brothers turned to television commercials, filming spots for Kentucky Fried Chicken and Planters peanuts, in which Tom invoked his famous line, &quot;Mom always did like you best!&quot;. Tom made a solo endorsement for Cheetos.

In 2007, Tom and Dick Smothers filmed a series of 30-second commercials and promotional spots for the River Rock Casino in Geyserville, California.

To augment their act in recent years, &quot;Yo-Yo Man&quot; became part of their shows. Tom Smothers had created the mostly non-speaking character in the late 1960s, a comedic performer of tricks using a yo-yo. The term &quot;Yo-Yo Man&quot; is registered in his name. In their 2008 tour, Yo-Yo Man was listed as the group&#x27;s opening act.

In 2008, during the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards, Smothers was awarded a special Emmy. In 1969, when he was head writer of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, the writing staff was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Comedic Series. Smothers had refused to let his name be on the list of writers nominated for the Emmy because he felt his name was too contentious. The award at the 2008 ceremony was presented by Steve Martin, one of the writers who originally won the award.

In December 2009, Tom and Dick both guest starred in a 21st-season episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; that also featured Cooper, Peyton, and Eli Manning.

The Smothers Brothers announced in May 2010 that their shows at The Orleans near Las Vegas would be &quot;farewell performances&quot; marking their retirement from touring.

On May 6, 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union&#x27;s Sonoma County chapter honored Smothers with its Jack Green Civil Liberties Award for his work against television censorship and for speaking out for peace and civil liberties.

Tom and Dick Smothers reunited in 2019 to mark the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&#x27;s&quot; abrupt cancellation.

On December 11, 2022, in an episode of &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;, the brothers announced they would go on tour in 2023.

==Personal life==
Smothers was the owner of Remick Ridge Vineyards in Sonoma County, California, which he established in 1977 and sold in 2023. Smothers and his wife, Marcy Carriker, have two children, Bo (born 1991) and Riley Rose (born 1996). He also had a son from his first marriage, Thomas Bolyn Smothers IV (Tom Jr.), who died in April 2023; and one grandson, Phoenix Parrish-Smothers. Tom and Dick had a sister, Sherry, born in September 1941 in Pasadena, California; she died in April 2023.

In 2023, Smothers announced he had been diagnosed with stage two lung cancer. He died from the disease at his home in Santa Rosa, California, on December 26, 2023, at age 86.

<text>Richard Remick Smothers (born November 20, 1939) is an American actor, comedian, composer, and musician. He was half of the musical comedy team the Smothers Brothers, with his older brother Tom.

== Early life ==
Smothers was born in New York City in 1939, the son of Ruth (&quot;née&quot; Remick), a homemaker, and Thomas B. Smothers, an Army officer who died as a prisoner of war of the Japanese in April 1945. His middle name, Remick, originates from his mother&#x27;s maiden name. 

After moving to Southern California, Dick attended Verdugo Hills High School in Tujunga, California, and graduated from Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California, and later attended San Jose State University, then called San Jose State College. At SJSC, Smothers participated as a distance runner for the track team, coached by Lloyd (Bud) Winter.

== Career ==

=== The Smothers Brothers ===
The Smothers Brothers formed in the late 1950s and appeared on numerous television shows, including two shows of their own: &quot;The Smothers Brothers Show&quot;, a sitcom from 1965 to 1966; and &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, a variety show in 1967. The show was cancelled by CBS on April 4, 1969. After filing a lawsuit, the Smothers were given $776,300. Though he often aided Tom with various subjects which were deemed controversial, Dick was in reality &quot;more conservative politically&quot; than his older brother was, with Tom stating in 2006, &quot;We still disagree about everything.&quot; 
In December 2009, Dick and Tom both guest-starred in a 21st-season episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; that also featured Cooper, Peyton, and Eli Manning.

The Smothers Brothers both announced their retirement from touring in May 2010. On the December 11, 2022, episode of &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;, the brothers announced that they would be going on tour in 2023. However, the tour was cancelled and Tom Smothers announced in July 2023 that he was diagnosed with stage 2 lung cancer. He died on December 26, 2023, at the age of 86.

=== Other works ===
In 1977, he appeared twice as a panelist on the daytime TV game show &quot;Match Game&quot;. In 1993, he played one of the characters on cartoon Christmas movie &quot;Precious Moments: Timmy&#x27;s Special Delivery&quot;. Without Tom, he also appeared in the 1995 Martin Scorsese-directed film &quot;Casino&quot; in an uncharacteristically serious role as a dishonest Nevada State Senator. His character and the dialogue in one scene were partly based on the career of former United States Senator Harry Reid, who once chaired the Nevada Gaming Commission.

Smothers has been active in amateur auto racing, both road racing and drag racing. He started the Smothers Brothers racing team, which competed in three championship seasons between 1968 and 1971. He specialized in endurance racing and drove cars at the famous Sebring and Le Mans events.

==Personal life==
In 2004, Smothers was taken to court in a domestic violence incident by his then-wife Denby after she accused him of intentionally pushing her into her car and poked her finger into her chest and allegedly said &quot;You have no rights to our house&quot; and that &quot;Our marriage is over&quot; 
Denby and Dick Smothers filed for divorce in late 2005 and it was finalized in 2006. Their Condo in Bird Key Florida was later foreclosed on and sold for just under $90,000. 
In a 2006 interview with the Vancouver-based Comedy Couch, Tom Smothers stated that he and his brother actually &quot;disagree about everything&quot; and that while he was &quot;a little bit looser,&quot; Dick was &quot;more conservative politically and also is a pragmatist. He&#x27;s very pragmatic and wants everything to line up and put in a box.&quot;

In February 2010, Smothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In May, he and his brother announced their retirement from touring. In October 2010, he announced he had been diagnosed with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus.

He is the father of six children — Dick Jr., Andrew, Steven, Sarah, Susan, and Remick. he resides in upstate New York. In September 2022, Smothers married Marie Navarolli Kropp.

<text>Vladimir Alexandrovich Voevodsky (, ; 4 June 1966 – 30 September 2017) was a Russian-American mathematician. His work in developing a homotopy theory for algebraic varieties and formulating motivic cohomology led to the award of a Fields Medal in 2002. He is also known for the proof of the Milnor conjecture and motivic Bloch–Kato conjectures and for the univalent foundations of mathematics and homotopy type theory.

== Early life and education ==

Vladimir Voevodsky&#x27;s father, Aleksander Voevodsky, was head of the Laboratory of High Energy Leptons in the Institute for Nuclear Research at the Russian Academy of Sciences. His mother Tatyana was a chemist. Voevodsky attended Moscow State University for a while, but was expelled without a diploma for refusing to attend classes and failing academically. He received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Harvard University in 1992 after being recommended without even applying and without a formal college degree, following several independent publications; he was advised there by David Kazhdan.

While he was a first year undergraduate, he was given a copy of &quot;Esquisse d&#x27;un Programme&quot; (submitted a few months earlier by Alexander Grothendieck to CNRS) by his advisor George Shabat. He learned the French language &quot;with the sole purpose of being able to read this text&quot; and started his research on some of the themes mentioned there.

== Work ==

Voevodsky&#x27;s work was in the intersection of algebraic geometry with algebraic topology. Along with Fabien Morel, Voevodsky introduced a homotopy theory for schemes. He also formulated what is now believed to be the correct form of motivic cohomology, and used this new tool to prove Milnor&#x27;s conjecture relating the Milnor K-theory of a field to its étale cohomology. For the above, he received the Fields Medal at the 24th International Congress of Mathematicians held in Beijing, China.

In 1998 he gave a plenary lecture (&quot;A1-Homotopy Theory&quot;) at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin. He coauthored (with Andrei Suslin and Eric M. Friedlander) &quot;Cycles, Transfers and Motivic Homology Theories&quot;, which develops the theory of motivic cohomology in some detail.

From 2002, Voevodsky was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

In January 2009, at an anniversary conference in honor of Alexander Grothendieck, held at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques, Voevodsky announced a proof of the full Bloch–Kato conjectures.

In 2009, he constructed the univalent model of Martin-Löf type theory in simplicial sets. This led to important advances in type theory and in the development of new univalent foundations of mathematics that Voevodsky worked on in his final years. He worked on a Coq library &quot;UniMath&quot; using univalent ideas.

In April 2016, the University of Gothenburg awarded an honorary doctorate to Voevodsky.

==Death and legacy ==
Voevodsky died on 30 September 2017 at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, aged 51, from an aneurysm. He was survived by his daughters, Diana Yasmine Voevodsky and Natalia Dalia Shalaby.

<doc id="104485" wikidata="Q315396" url="?curid=104485" title="Laurent Lafforgue">
<text>Laurent Lafforgue (; born 6 November 1966) is a French mathematician. He has made outstanding contributions to Langlands&#x27; program in the fields of number theory and analysis, and in particular proved the Langlands conjectures for the automorphism group of a function field. The crucial contribution by Lafforgue to solve this question is the construction of compactifications of certain moduli stacks of shtukas. The proof was the result of more than six years of concentrated efforts.

In 2002 at the 24th International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing, China, he received the Fields Medal together with Vladimir Voevodsky.

== Biography ==
Laurent Lafforgue has two brothers, Thomas and Vincent, both mathematicians. Thomas is now a teacher in a &quot;classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles&quot; at Lycée Louis le Grand in Paris and Vincent a CNRS directeur de recherches at the Institut Fourier in Grenoble.

He won 2 silver medals at International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in 1984 and 1985. He entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1986. In 1994 he received his Ph.D. under the direction of Gérard Laumon in the Arithmetic and Algebraic Geometry team at the Université de Paris-Sud. Currently he is a research director of CNRS. He was detached as permanent professor of mathematics at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHÉS) in Bures-sur-Yvette, France, in 2000-2021. In 2021, he left his IHÉS position and moved to Huawei.

Laurent is a devout Catholic and never married.

==Career==
He received the Clay Research Award in 2000, and the of the French Academy of Sciences in 2001 and was awarded the Fields Medal in 2002. His younger brother Vincent Lafforgue is also a notable mathematician. On 22 May 2011 Lafforgue was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Notre Dame.

==Views==
Lafforgue is a critic of what he calls the &quot;pedagogically correct&quot; in France&#x27;s educational system. In 2005, he was forced to resign from the Haut conseil de l&#x27;éducation after he expressed these views in a private letter that he sent to Bruno Racine, president of the HCE, that later was made public.

<doc id="104492" wikidata="Q215506" url="?curid=104492" title="Jerry Seinfeld">
<text>Jerome Allen Seinfeld ( ; born April 29, 1954) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer. As a stand-up comedian, Seinfeld specializes in observational comedy. Seinfeld has received numerous accolades including a Primetime Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Awards, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards as well as nominations for four Grammy Awards. In 2004, Comedy Central named him the 12th-greatest stand-up comedian of all time. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named him the 7th-greatest stand-up comedian of all time.

Seinfeld gained stardom playing a semi-fictionalized version of himself in the NBC sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1989–1998), which he co-created and wrote with Larry David. Seinfeld earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1995. The show is one of the most acclaimed and popular sitcoms of all time. He has since created and produced the reality series &quot;The Marriage Ref&quot; (2010–2011), and created and hosted the web series &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot; (2012–2019), the latter of which earned him three Webby Awards. He also co-produced, co-wrote, and starred in the DreamWorks animated film &quot;Bee Movie&quot; (2007) and the Netflix comedy &quot;Unfrosted&quot; (2024).

He has released four standup specials his first being &quot;Stand-Up Confidential&quot; (1987) followed by &quot;I&#x27;m Telling You for the Last Time&quot; (1998), &quot;Jerry Before Seinfeld&quot; (2017) and &quot;23 Hours to Kill&quot; (2020). Seinfeld has also written three books starting with &quot;SeinLanguage&quot; (1993), followed by the children&#x27;s book &quot;Halloween&quot; (2002), and the comedic compilation book &quot;Is This Anything?&quot; (2020). He is an avid fan of coffee and automobiles. He practices transcendental meditation. He is married to author and philanthropist Jessica Seinfeld, with whom he has three children.

== Early life and education ==
Seinfeld was born on April 29, 1954, to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York City. His father, Kalmen Seinfeld, a sign painter, was from Hungary and collected jokes that he heard while serving in World War II. His mother, Betty (née Hosni) and her parents, Selim and Salha Hosni, were Syrian Jews from Aleppo. Their nationality was stated as Turkish when they immigrated in 1917, as Syria was under the Ottoman Empire. Seinfeld has an older sister, Carolyn. Salha&#x27;s mother, Garez Dayan, Seinfeld&#x27;s great-grandmother, was a member of the Dayan rabbinic family, who claim ancestry back to the Medieval Exilarchs, and from the Exilarchs back to the Biblical King David. Seinfeld&#x27;s second cousin is alternative metal musician and actor Evan Seinfeld.

Seinfeld grew up in Massapequa, in the Nassau County of Long Island and attended Massapequa High School. At 16, he spent time volunteering in Kibbutz Sa&#x27;ar in Israel. He attended the State University of New York at Oswego, and transferred after his second year to Queens College of the City University of New York in Flushing, from which he graduated in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications and theater.

== Career ==
===1976–1987: Rise to prominence ===
Seinfeld developed an interest in stand-up comedy after brief stints in college productions. He appeared on open-mic nights at Budd Friedman&#x27;s Improv Club while attending Queens College. After graduation in 1976, he tried out at an open-mic night at New York City&#x27;s Catch a Rising Star, which led to an appearance in a Rodney Dangerfield HBO special. In 1980, he had a small recurring role on the sitcom &quot;Benson&quot;, playing Frankie, a mail-delivery boy who had comedy routines that no one wanted to hear. Seinfeld was abruptly fired from the show due to creative differences. Seinfeld said that he was not told he had been fired until he arrived for a read-through session and found that there was no script for him. In January 1981, he performed stand-up on &quot;An Evening at the Improv&quot;. In May, Seinfeld made an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, impressing Carson and the audience, leading to frequent appearances on that show and others, including &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. On September 5, 1987, his first one-hour special &quot;Stand-Up Confidential&quot; aired live on HBO.

===1988–1998: &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and stardom ===

Seinfeld created &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles&quot; with Larry David in 1988 for NBC. It was renamed &quot;Seinfeld&quot; to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom &quot;The Marshall Chronicles&quot;. By its third season, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; had become the most watched sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular syndicated re-run ever since. NBC offered Seinfeld $110 million—a record $5 million an episode for a 22-episode tenth season—but he declined. Along with Seinfeld, the show starred &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumna Julia Louis-Dreyfus and established actors Michael Richards and Jason Alexander. Alexander played George, a caricature of Larry David. Seinfeld is the only actor to appear in every episode.

=== 1998–2010: Established career ===
After he ended his sitcom, Seinfeld moved back to New York City and returned to stand-up comedy instead of staying in Los Angeles and furthering his acting career. In 1998, he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled &quot;I&#x27;m Telling You for the Last Time&quot;. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, &quot;Comedian&quot;, which also featured fellow comic Orny Adams and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines. In the late 1990s, Apple Computer came up with the advertising slogan &quot;Think different&quot; and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to &quot;think differently,&quot; such as Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, although he had not been in the original cut. This shorter version of the commercial aired only once, during the series finale of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.
In 2004, Seinfeld appeared in two commercial webisodes promoting American Express, titled &quot;The Adventures of Seinfeld &amp; Superman&quot;. In these, Seinfeld appeared with a cartoon rendering of Superman, to whom reference was made in numerous episodes of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as Seinfeld&#x27;s hero, voiced by Patrick Warburton (character David Puddy on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;). The webisodes were directed by Barry Levinson and aired briefly on television. Seinfeld and &quot;Superman&quot; were also interviewed by Matt Lauer in a specially recorded interview for the &quot;Today&quot; show. On November 18, 2004, Seinfeld appeared at the National Museum of American History to donate the &quot;puffy shirt&quot; he wore in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode of the same name. He also gave a speech when presenting the &quot;puffy shirt,&quot; saying humorously that &quot;This is the most embarrassing moment of my life.&quot; On May 13, 2006, Seinfeld had a cameo appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as host Julia Louis-Dreyfus&#x27; assassin. Louis-Dreyfus in her opening monologue mentioned the &quot;Seinfeld curse.&quot; While talking about how ridiculous the &quot;curse&quot; was, a stage light suddenly fell next to her. The camera moved to a catwalk above the stage where Seinfeld was standing, holding a large pair of bolt cutters. He angrily muttered, &quot;Damn it!&quot; upset that it did not hit her. Louis-Dreyfus continued to say that she is indeed not cursed.

On February 25, 2007, Seinfeld appeared at the 79th Academy Awards as the presenter for &quot;Best Documentary.&quot; Before announcing the nominations, he did a monologue about the unspoken agreement between movie theater owners and movie patrons. On October 4, 2007, Seinfeld made a guest appearance as himself in the &quot;30 Rock&quot; episode &quot;SeinfeldVision.&quot; On February 24, 2008, at the 80th Academy Awards, Seinfeld appeared as the voice of his &quot;Bee Movie&quot; animated character Barry, presenting Best Animated Short Film. Before announcing the nominees, he showed a montage of film clips featuring bees, saying that they were some of his early work (as Barry).

On June 2, 2008, amidst his spring 2008 tour, Seinfeld performed in his hometown of New York City for a one-night-only show at the Hammerstein Ballroom to benefit &quot;Stand Up for a Cure&quot;, a charity aiding lung cancer research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In August 2008, the Associated Press reported that Jerry Seinfeld would be the pitchman for Windows Vista, as part of a $300-million advertising campaign by Microsoft. The ads, which were intended to create interest for Windows in support of the subsequent &quot;I&#x27;m a PC&quot; advertisements, began airing in mid-September 2008. They were cut from television after three installments; Microsoft opted to continue with the &quot;I&#x27;m a PC&quot; advertisements and run the Seinfeld ads on the Microsoft website as a series of longer advertisements. In March 2009, it was announced that Seinfeld and the entire cast of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; would be appearing for a reunion in Larry David&#x27;s HBO series &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. The fictional reunion took place in the seventh season&#x27;s finale and starred most of the original cast, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander, Michael Richards, in a multiple-episode arc. Seinfeld appeared on an episode of the Starz original series &quot;Head Case&quot;. As was the case in many of his previous guest appearances on sitcoms, he played himself.

In Australia, Seinfeld appeared on a series of advertisements for the Greater Building Society, a building society based in New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. His appearance in these ads was highly publicized and considered a coup for the society, being the third time Seinfeld had appeared in a television commercial. The advertisements were filmed in Cedarhurst, Long Island, with the street designed to emulate Beaumont Street in Hamilton, where the Greater&#x27;s head offices are located. Seinfeld also wrote the scripts for the 15 advertisements that were filmed. The ads largely aired in the Northern New South Wales television market, where the society has most of its branches. Seinfeld was the first guest on Jay Leno&#x27;s talk show &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, which premiered on September 14, 2009. Seinfeld was featured on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s Weekend Update sketch to do the &quot;Really!?!&quot; segment with Seth Meyers. He executive produced and regularly appeared as a panelist in &quot;The Marriage Ref&quot;. On August 30, 2010, Seinfeld made a surprise guest appearance on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, ending the feud the two had in the early 1990s.

Seinfeld toured the U.S. in 2011 and made his first stand-up appearance in the United Kingdom in 11 years. In July 2011, he was a surprise guest on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, helping Jon Stewart to suppress his urge to tell &quot;cheap&quot; &quot;Michele Bachmann&#x27;s husband acts gay&quot; jokes. Seinfeld also launched a personal archives website at JerrySeinfeld.com and appeared in the HBO special &quot;Talking Funny&quot; with fellow comedians Chris Rock, Louis C.K., and Ricky Gervais in the same year.

=== 2011–present: Talk show and expansion ===
In 2012, Seinfeld started a web series titled &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;, in which he would pick up a fellow comedian in a different car every episode and take them out for coffee and conversation. The show originally aired on the Crackle streaming service and then was bought by Netflix. The initial series consisted of ten episodes lasting from 7 to 25 minutes each. The show has continued to get high-profile guests such as Alec Baldwin, Mel Brooks, Bill Burr, Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Larry David, Ellen DeGeneres, Tina Fey, David Letterman, Jerry Lewis, Steve Martin, John Mulaney, Eddie Murphy, Carl Reiner, Don Rickles, Chris Rock, Howard Stern, and Jon Stewart. The show has also hosted &quot;Seinfeld&quot; alums Larry David, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander, and Michael Richards. Season seven featured its most high-profile guest, then-President Barack Obama. In a farewell tribute video for the Obamas before the President left office, Seinfeld stated, &quot;That knocking on the Oval Office window. That probably was the peak of my entire existence.&quot;

In 2014, Seinfeld told David Letterman he invited Woody Allen to be on the show but hadn&#x27;t heard back. That same year he also revealed Joan Rivers was supposed to be a guest on the show before she died due to a botched medical procedure. Seinfeld signed a deal with Netflix in January 2017 that included placing &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot; on their streaming service as well as two new Seinfeld stand-up specials and the development of scripted and non-scripted comedy programming. As part of the deal, all episodes of &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot; were made available on the streaming service, in addition to a new 24-episode season. The series was nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards and won three Webby Awards.
In June 2013, Seinfeld appeared on rapper Wale&#x27;s album &quot;The Gifted&quot;, on the song &quot;Outro About Nothing.&quot; Seinfeld received coverage for his speech at the 2014 Clio Awards ceremony, where he received an honorary award, as media reporters said that he &quot;mocked&quot; and &quot;ripped apart&quot; the advertising industry; his statement that &quot;I love advertising because I love lying&quot; received particular attention. In 2014, Seinfeld hosted the special &quot;Don Rickles: One Night Only&quot; at the Apollo Theatre. The event celebrated Don Rickles and his career, but also served as a roast among friends. Those who participated in the event included Jon Stewart, David Letterman, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Nathan Lane, Regis Philbin, Robert De Niro, and Martin Scorsese. On February 15, 2015, Seinfeld made a guest appearance on the &quot;Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special&quot;, where he hosted the &quot;Questions from the Audience&quot; segment, which included cameos from Michael Douglas, John Goodman, James Franco, Larry David, Ellen Cleghorne, Dakota Johnson, Tim Meadows, Bob Odenkirk, and Sarah Palin (who Seinfeld initially mistook for Tina Fey). On May 20, 2015, Seinfeld made a guest appearance on David Letterman&#x27;s final &quot;Late Show&quot; episode. Seinfeld joined guests including Alec Baldwin, Barbara Walters, Steve Martin, Jim Carrey, Chris Rock, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Peyton Manning, Tina Fey, and Bill Murray who all participated in The Top Ten List segment, &quot;Things I&#x27;ve Always Wanted to Say to Dave.&quot;

In January 2017, Seinfeld went on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; and joined Dave Chappelle and Jimmy Fallon in honoring outgoing First Lady Michelle Obama, and played a game of &quot;Catchphrase&quot;, which Obama and Fallon won to Seinfeld&#x27;s dismay. On September 19, 2017, Netflix released the stand-up comedy special &quot;Jerry Before Seinfeld&quot;. It follows Seinfeld as he returns for a stand-up routine at the New York City comedy club, Comic Strip Live, which started his career. It is intercut with documentary clips and his stand-up special. It was later released as an LP, CD and download album, and was nominated for a 2018 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. In 2020, it was announced that Netflix would be releasing Seinfeld&#x27;s first original stand-up special in 22 years, &quot;23 Hours to Kill&quot;. The special premiered on May 5. In October 2020, Seinfeld joined Steve Martin in a discussion about comedy at &quot;The New Yorker Festival&quot;. They discussed subjects ranging from the creative process, Netflix, and The Oscars, to their comedy backgrounds, and the future of comedy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2024 he directed, co-wrote, and produced in the Netflix comedy film &quot;Unfrosted&quot;, a satirical spoof about the creation of Pop-Tarts. Seinfeld also starred in the film alongside Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, and Hugh Grant. The film earned mixed reviews with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; writing the film received a &quot;sharply divided reaction from critics&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; labeled it a &quot;Critic&#x27;s Pick&quot; with Anne Nicholson describing it as a &quot;full-fledged, fully ridiculous feature comedy targeted to the audience’s sweet-and-salty dopamine receptors&quot;. David Ehrlich of &quot;IndieWire&quot; wrote that the &quot;comedy never heats up&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s a movie about so many different things at once that it comes to feel like a movie about nothing&quot;. Seinfeld appeared as a guest on &quot;John Mulaney Presents: Everybody&#x27;s in LA&quot; where he joked that it was &quot;the weirdest talk show I&#x27;ve ever been on in my life&quot;. He also embarked on a new tour starting with his first show in Singapore in June 2024 followed by a number of stops in Australia and North America. Seinfeld returned to &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; in its final season reuniting with Larry David where they poked fun at the controversial ending of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. Ben Travers of &quot;IndieWire&quot; wrote, &quot;If the &quot;Curb&quot; finale is meant to rewrite the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; ending in any way, it&#x27;s during that first scene between Jerry and Larry. They&#x27;re playing out the kind of scene they used to write for Jerry and George, and getting that silly, joyful spark between two TV legends — even for a moment — is pure bliss&quot;.

==Books==
Seinfeld wrote the book &quot;SeinLanguage&quot;, released in 1993. Written as his television show was first rising in popularity, it is primarily an adaptation of his stand-up material. The title comes from an article in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listing the numerous catchphrases for which the show was responsible. In 2002, he wrote the children&#x27;s book &quot;Halloween&quot;. The book was illustrated by James Bennett. Seinfeld wrote the forewords to Ted L. Nancy&#x27;s &quot;Letters from a Nut&quot; series of books and Ed Broth&#x27;s &quot;Stories from a Moron&quot;. Seinfeld also wrote the foreword to the &quot;Peanut Butter &amp; Co. Cookbook&quot;. In October 2020, Seinfeld released his new book &quot;Is This Anything?&quot;. The book chronicles Seinfeld&#x27;s 45 years working in comedy and contains many of his best bits that span from various decades.

==Influences==
Seinfeld has stated, &quot;On the Mount Rushmore of stand-up comedy, there are four faces, in my opinion: Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Bill Cosby, and Don Rickles.&quot; Seinfeld has also cited as his influences Jean Shepherd, &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;, Jonathan Winters, Jerry Lewis, Robert Klein, and Abbott and Costello. He stated, &quot;Monty Python was a gigantic influence on me. They were just about silly, funny things that meant nothing, and that&#x27;s the stuff I love. There&#x27;s a wonderful childlike freedom in those kinds of things.&quot;

In the Netflix comedy special, &quot;Jerry Before Seinfeld&quot;, he displayed his personal comedy albums collection from when he was a teenager. These albums included:

*Lenny Bruce – &quot;Thank You Masked Man&quot; (1972)
*George Carlin – &quot;Class Clown&quot; (1972)
*Steve Martin – &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Small&quot; (1977)
*Bob Newhart – &quot;The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart&quot; (1960)
*Mike Nichols and Elaine May – &quot;Improvisations to Music&quot; (1958)
*Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner – &quot;2000 and One Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks&quot; (1961)

In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Seinfeld stated his five favorite films are &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; (1972), &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), &quot;The In-Laws&quot; (1979), &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1935), and &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; (1992).

Those influenced by Seinfeld include John Mulaney, Ellen DeGeneres, Jim Gaffigan, Judd Apatow, Issa Rae,
Nate Bargatze, and
Mark Normand.
On &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, Steve Martin described Seinfeld as one of his &quot;retro heroes&quot; saying &quot;[He&#x27;s] a guy who came up behind me and is better than I am. I think he&#x27;s fantastic, I love to listen to him, he almost puts me at peace. I love to listen to him talk&quot;.

==Personal life==

Seinfeld is a fan of the New York Mets and periodically calls Steve Somers&#x27; show on WFAN-AM, a sports talk radio station, as &quot;Jerry from Queens.&quot; Seinfeld called four innings of a Mets game on SportsNet New York on June 23, 2010, reuniting with analyst Keith Hernandez, who appeared in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; two-part episode entitled &quot;The Boyfriend.&quot; According to Seinfeld, he thinks about baseball &quot;all day&quot; and has said &quot;when I think of retirement, all I would think of is going to a baseball game every day.&quot;

Seinfeld is left-handed, and the first joke he ever wrote was about the topic. In a 2014 interview with NBC News, he made statements suggesting that he believed he was on the autism spectrum. However, following criticism for his alleged self-diagnosis, he later clarified that he is not autistic and had been commenting on a play about the condition that he &quot;related to [...] on some level&quot;.

=== Relationships and marriage ===
Years before &quot;Seinfeld&quot; was created, Seinfeld dated Carol Leifer. She was a fellow comedian, and one of the inspirations for the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; character Elaine Benes. On national television with sex therapist and talk show host Dr. Ruth Westheimer, he mentioned that he was engaged in 1984 but called it off.

In May 1993, Seinfeld met 17-year-old Shoshanna Lonstein in Central Park. After a brief conversation, Lonstein gave Seinfeld her phone number. Seinfeld and Lonstein dated for approximately four years, until 1997. She transferred from George Washington University to UCLA, in part to be with him, ultimately citing constant press coverage and missing New York City as reasons for the relationship ending.
In August 1998, while at a Reebok Sports Club, Seinfeld met Jessica Sklar, a public relations executive for Tommy Hilfiger who had just returned from a three-week honeymoon in Italy with then-husband Eric Nederlander, a theatrical producer and scion of a theater-owning family. Unaware of Sklar&#x27;s marital status, Seinfeld invited her out. When Sklar eventually told Seinfeld about her relationship situation, she said, &quot;I told him I didn&#x27;t think this was the right time for me to be involved with anybody.&quot; Two months later, Sklar filed for divorce and began dating Seinfeld. The pair married on December 25, 1999. Comedian George Wallace was the best man at the wedding. After the nuptials, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld bought Billy Joel&#x27;s house in Amagansett, New York, for US$32 million after news of the couple&#x27;s interest in the property became public in 2000. The Seinfelds have a daughter and two sons.

=== Wealth and charity ===
In 1999, Seinfeld auctioned a Breitling Chronomat watch as part of the &quot;Famous Faces, Watch Auction For Charity&quot; event in New York City. This watch sold for $11,000. In 2001, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld created the charitable organization Good+Foundation after their first child was born. Good+Foundation grants donations of products and services to programs that have demonstrated a capacity to address family poverty in three focus areas: supporting new mothers, investing in early childhood, and engaging fathers. GOOD+ Foundation has donated over $42M worth of items through its partner network across the United States. Seinfeld has also participated in Jon Stewart&#x27;s charity event, &quot;Night of Too Many Stars&quot;.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, Seinfeld&#x27;s cumulative earnings from &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as of 2004 was $267 million, placing him at the top of the celebrity earnings list that year. He turned down $5 million per episode, for 22 episodes, to continue the show for a 10th season. Seinfeld earned $100 million from syndication deals and stand-up performances in 2004, and $60 million in 2006. He also earned $10 million for appearing with Bill Gates in Microsoft&#x27;s 2008 advertisements for Windows. Between June 2008 and June 2009, Seinfeld earned $85 million, making him the world&#x27;s highest-paid comedian during those 12 months. In 2013, &quot;Forbes&quot; documented Seinfeld&#x27;s annual income as $32 million. In mid-2013, Seinfeld disputed &quot;Forbes&quot; claims regarding his income and net worth on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. Seinfeld was ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; the highest-paid comedian for 2015, the second-highest-paid in 2016, and the highest-paid again in 2017. Seinfeld&#x27;s income between June 2016 and June 2017 was $69 million.

In 2024, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; declared Seinfeld a billionaire, with a net worth standing at more than $1 billion, thanks to various syndication deals his sitcom signed, with $465 million coming from those deals, making him one of the richest celebrities.

===Automobiles===

Seinfeld is an automobile enthusiast and collector, and he owns a collection of about 150 cars, including many Porsches. He rented a hangar at Santa Monica Airport in Santa Monica, California, in the 1990s to store cars. In 2002, Seinfeld purchased property on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City where he built a $1.4 million two-story garage to store Porsches. One tally has Seinfeld owning 43 Porsches. Paul Bannister has written that Seinfeld&#x27;s collection includes Porsche 911s from various years, 10 Porsche Boxsters each painted a different color, and the 1955 Porsche 550 Spyder, the same model and pearl-grey color of the car James Dean was driving in his fatal crash.

The centerpiece of the Seinfeld collection is Steve McQueen&#x27;s Porsche 917 Chassis 022, driven extensively in the 1971 film &quot;Le Mans&quot;, acquired by Seinfeld in 2002, and restored by Joe Cavaglieri to the 1971-era Gulf Porsche team livery. 

The Discovery Channel television show &quot;Chasing Classic Cars&quot; claimed that Seinfeld owns the first and last produced air-cooled Porsche 911s. He has a $700,000 Porsche 959, one of only 337 built. He was originally not allowed to drive it, because the car was &quot;not street legal.&quot; U.S. emissions and crash tests had not been performed for the model because Porsche refused to donate four Porsche 959s for destruction tests. Seinfeld imported the car &quot;for exhibition purposes,&quot; on the stipulation that it may never be driven on U.S. roads. The car was made U.S. street legal in 1999 under the &quot;Show or Display&quot; federal law. Seinfeld wrote an article for the February 2004 issue of &quot;Automobile&quot;, reviewing the Porsche Carrera GT.

In 2008, Seinfeld was involved in a car accident when the brakes on his 1967 Fiat 500 failed and, to avoid an intersection, he pulled the emergency brake while turning sharply, ultimately causing the car to flip onto its side. No one was hurt.

===Coffee machines===
A coffee aficionado, Seinfeld owns multiple espresso machines, including the $17,000 Elektra Belle Epoque and two machines manufactured by Slayer and Breville. Seinfeld described his single-group Slayer machine, which costs upwards of $8,500, as a &quot;beautiful machine.&quot; When NPR asked him about the influence of coffee culture in the U.S., Seinfeld responded in 2013:I never liked [coffee] and I didn&#x27;t understand it and I used to do a lot of stuff in my stand-up set in the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s about how I don&#x27;t &#x27;get&#x27; coffee. And then something happened about five years ago. I started touring a lot, and we would have these great big, fun breakfasts in the hotel and [coffee] just seemed to go really well [with breakfast]. [Now], I&#x27;ve just started this espresso thing.

In a May 2024 &quot;GQ&quot; interview titled &quot;10 Things Jerry Seinfeld Can&#x27;t Live Without&quot;, Seinfeld revealed that a Bialetti moka pot is one of his must-haves. He described the process of making coffee with a moka pot as complex and time-consuming, but a pleasurable way to &quot;waste time&quot;.

=== Religion and politics ===
Seinfeld is Jewish and has incorporated elements of his Jewish identity in his work. Although he shared that his mother was born into a large family of Syrian Orthodox Jews, he admitted to being non-religious himself. Seinfeld stated that he took a Scientology course when he was in his 20s; he said that he found it interesting but that he did not pursue it any further.

Seinfeld expressed support for Israel during the Israel–Hamas war, saying &quot;I will always stand with Israel and the Jewish people.&quot; Seinfeld and his family previously drew criticism, travelling to the West Bank in 2018 to participate in an anti-terrorism training camp. Seinfeld also visited the headquarters of Abducted and Missing Families Forum where he met with representatives of the families and with abductees who returned from Hamas captivity, and listened to their stories. On May 12, 2024, Seinfeld gave a commencement address and received an honorary degree at Duke University. During his speech, a number of students booed, waved Palestinian flags and walked out in protest. In June 2024, Seinfeld was heckled by protesters during a comedy show in Sydney, Australia. Seinfeld responded joking, &quot;You&#x27;re really influencing everyone here. We&#x27;re all on your side now, because you&#x27;ve made your point so well, and in the right venue, you’ve come to the right place for a political conversation&quot;. In 2025, responding to a social media influencer and ambush activist who said &quot;Free Palestine&quot;, he shook his head and replied “I don&#x27;t care about Palestine.&quot;

Seinfeld has made several political contributions, including to George W. Bush&#x27;s and Al Gore&#x27;s presidential campaigns in 2000, and subsequently to four Democratic Party primary candidates in 2000 and 2004.

Seinfeld has expressed his distaste for what he views as political correctness. In 2015, Seinfeld stated that he avoids performing on college campuses because students have become too easily offended by his comedic routines. In a 2024 interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Seinfeld claimed political correctness was destroying comedy, saying, &quot;This is the result of the extreme left and PC crap, and people worrying so much about offending other people. When you write a script and it goes into four or five different hands, committees, groups — &#x27;Here&#x27;s our thought about this joke&#x27; — well, that&#x27;s the end of your comedy.&quot; Months later, he walked back those comments on the &quot;Breaking Bread&quot; podcast, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t think, as I said, &#x27;the extreme left&#x27; has done anything to inhibit the art of comedy. I&#x27;m taking that back officially.&quot; Seinfeld said he regrets his previous comments because changing cultural attitudes are &quot;not [his] business.&quot;

=== Transcendental Meditation ===
In December 2012, Seinfeld said that he had been practicing Transcendental Meditation for 40 years. He promoted the use of the technique in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder with Bob Roth of the David Lynch Foundation in December 2012 on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and also appeared at a 2009 David Lynch Foundation benefit for TM, at which Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr appeared. On November 5, 2015, the David Lynch Foundation organized a benefit concert at New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall called &quot;Change Begins Within&quot; to promote transcendental meditation for stress control. &quot;It&#x27;s been the greatest companion technique of living that I&#x27;ve ever come across, and I&#x27;m thrilled to be part of this movement that seems to have really been reinvigorated by Bob [Roth] and David Lynch,&quot; Seinfeld said. &quot;I would do anything that I could to promote it in the world, because I think it&#x27;s the greatest thing as a life tool, as a work tool and just making things make sense.&quot;

<text>Maxim Lvovich Kontsevich (, ; born 25 August 1964) is a Russian and French mathematician and mathematical physicist. He is a professor at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques and a distinguished professor at the University of Miami. He received the Henri Poincaré Prize in 1997, the Fields Medal in 1998, the Crafoord Prize in 2008, the Shaw Prize and Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics in 2012, and the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics in 2015.

== Academic career and research ==
He was born into the family of Lev Kontsevich, Soviet orientalist and author of the Kontsevich system. After ranking second in the All-Union Mathematics Olympiads, he attended Moscow State University but left without a degree in 1985 to become a researcher at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems in Moscow. While at the institute he published papers that caught the interest of the Max Planck Institute in Bonn and was invited for three months. Just before the end of his time there, he attended a five-day international meeting, the Arbeitstagung, where he sketched a proof of the Witten conjecture to the amazement of Michael Atiyah and other mathematicians and his invitation to the institute was subsequently extended to three years.

The next year he finished the proof and worked on various topics on mathematical physics and in 1992 received his Dr. rer. nat. at the University of Bonn under Don Bernard Zagier. His thesis outlines a proof of a conjecture by Edward Witten that two quantum gravitational models are equivalent. In 1992, Kontsevich was appointed to a full professorship in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, before moving in 1995 to France, where he joined the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques in Bures-sur-Yvette as a permanent member.

His work concentrates on geometric aspects of mathematical physics, most notably on knot theory, quantization, and mirror symmetry. One of his results is a formal deformation quantization that holds for any Poisson manifold. He also introduced the Kontsevich integral, a topological invariant of knots (and links) defined by complicated integrals analogous to Feynman integrals, and generalizing the classical Gauss linking number. In topological field theory, he introduced the moduli space of stable maps, which may be considered a mathematically rigorous formulation of the Feynman integral for topological string theory. He also proved that the Dixmier conjecture is equivalent to the Jacobian conjecture.

==Honors and awards==
In 1998, he won the Fields Medal &quot;for his contributions to algebraic geometry, topology, and mathematical physics, including the proof of Witten&#x27;s conjecture of intersection numbers in moduli spaces of stable curves, construction of the universal Vassiliev invariant of knots, and formal quantization of Poisson manifolds.&quot; In July 2012, he was an inaugural awardee of the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, the creation of physicist and internet entrepreneur, Yuri Milner. Also in 2012, he was awarded the Shaw Prize. In 2015, he was awarded Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics.

<text>A yo-yo (also spelled yoyo) is a toy consisting of an axle connected to two disks, and a string looped around the axle, similar to a . It is an ancient toy with proof of existence since 440 BC. The yo-yo was also called a bandalore in the 17th century.

It is played by holding the free end of the string known as the &quot;handle&quot; (by inserting one fingerusually the middle or ring fingerinto a slip knot), allowing gravity (or the force of a throw and gravity) to spin the yo-yo and unwind the string (similar to how a pullstring works). The player then allows the yo-yo to wind itself back to the player&#x27;s hand, exploiting its spin (and the associated rotational energy). This is often called &quot;yo-yoing&quot; or &quot;playing yo-yo&quot;.

In the simplest play, the string is intended to be wound on the spool by hand; the yo-yo is thrown downward, hits the end of the string then winds up the string toward the hand, and finally the yo-yo is grabbed, ready to be thrown again. One of the most basic tricks is called the sleeper, where the yo-yo spins at the end of the string for a noticeable amount of time before returning to the hand.

==Etymology and history==
The word yo-yo probably comes from the Ilocano term yóyo, or a cognate word from the Philippines.


A Greek vase painting from 440 BC shows a boy playing with a yo-yo (see right). Greek records from the period describe toys made out of wood, metal, or painted terra cotta (fired clay). The terra cotta disks were used to ceremonially offer the toys of youth to certain gods when a child came of age—discs of other materials were used for actual play.

=== First yo-yo company ===
In 1928, Pedro Flores, a Filipino immigrant to the United States, opened the Yo-yo Manufacturing Company in Santa Barbara, California. The business started with a dozen handmade toys; by November 1929, Flores was operating two additional factories in Los Angeles and Hollywood, which all together employed 600 workers and produced 300,000 units daily.

The principal distinction between the Filipino design popularized by Flores and the more traditional yo-yos is in the way the yo-yo is strung. In older (and some remaining inexpensive) yo-yo designs, the string is tied to the axle using a knot. With this technique, the yo-yo just goes back and forth; it returns easily, but it is impossible to make it sleep. In Flores&#x27;s design, one continuous piece of string, double the desired length, is twisted around something to produce a loop at one end which is fitted around the axle. Also termed a &quot;looped slip-string&quot;, this seemingly minor modification allows for a far greater variety and sophistication of motion, thanks to increased stability and suspension of movement during free spin.

Shortly thereafter (c. 1929), entrepreneur Donald F. Duncan recognized the potential of this new fad and purchased the Flores yo-yo Corporation and all its assets, including the Flores name, which was transferred to the new company in 1932.

The name &quot;Yo-yo&quot; was registered in 1932 as a trademark by in Vancouver, Canada, and Harvey Lowe won the first World Yo-Yo Contest in London, England. In 1932, Swedish Kalmartrissan yo-yos started to be manufactured as well.

In 1933, yo-yos were banned in Syria, because many locals superstitiously blamed the use of them for a severe drought.

In 1946, the Duncan Toys Company opened a yo-yo factory in Luck, Wisconsin. The Duncan yo-yo was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York, in 1999.

=== 1960s resurgence ===
Declining sales after World War II prompted Duncan to launch a comeback campaign for his trademarked &quot;Yo-Yo&quot; in 1962 with a series of television advertisements.

In a trademark case in 1965, a federal court of appeal ruled in favor of the Royal Tops Company, determining that &quot;yo-yo&quot; had become a part of common speech and that Duncan no longer had exclusive rights to the term. As a result of the expenses incurred by this legal battle as well as other financial pressures, the Duncan family sold the company name and associated trademarks in 1968 to Flambeau, Inc, which had manufactured Duncan&#x27;s plastic models since 1955. , Flambeau Plastics continued to run the company.
=== Rise of the ball bearing ===
As popularity spread through the 1970s and 1980s, there were a number of innovations in yo-yo technology, primarily regarding the connection between the string and the axle. In 1979, dentist and yo-yo celebrity Tom Kuhn patented the &quot;No Jive 3-in-1&quot; yo-yo, creating the world&#x27;s first &quot;take-apart&quot; yo-yo, which enabled yo-yo players to change the axle.

Swedish bearing company SKF briefly manufactured novelty yo-yos with ball bearings in 1984. In 1990, Kuhn introduced the SB-2 yo-yo that had an aluminum transaxle, making it the first successful ball-bearing yo-yo. The SB2 was originally offered only in a natural silver color, but as time went on, it became available in many different colors, with various decorative embellishments.

In all transaxle yo-yos, ball bearings significantly reduce friction when the yo-yo is spinning, enabling longer and more complex tricks. Subsequent yo-yo players used this ability to their advantage, creating new tricks that had not been possible with fixed-axle designs.

There are many new types of ball bearings in the market which deviate from the original design and/or material of the standard stainless steel ball bearing. For example, a certain type of bearing has an inward facing curved surface, to prevent the string from rubbing on the sides of the yo-yo, which would cause unwanted friction when performing intricate string tricks. Other manufacturers replicate this with a similar inwardly curved surface, but use minor modifications. Some high-end bearings use ceramic composites in the balls of the bearing, to reduce internal friction, again making for a smoother spinning yo-yo. Precious materials such as ruby have also been used as a material in prototype ball bearings for its properties such as extreme hardness. The material was first tested in a prototype bearing made by Wolf Yoyo Works in May 2018.

=== Modern yo-yo ===
The era following the yo-yo boom of the late 1990s is often referred to as the &quot;modern&quot; era of yo-yo. The modern era of yo-yo is characterized by markedly more complicated and sophisticated yo-yo techniques than came before in addition to a plethora of different yo-yo designs created to serve various niche purposes. This increased complexity of yo-yo play was allowed by the introduction of the ball-bearing technology to yo-yos, which enabled yo-yos to spin much longer than was previously possible. This, in addition to the advent of the bind technique and unresponsive yo-yoing equipped yo-yo players with an essentially limitless amount of freedom, with which they were able to create myriad yo-yo tricks and techniques.

In the wake of this revolution that took place in yo-yo, a landscape of yo-yo competitions tailored towards this modern style of yo-yo play emerged. One example of such competitions is the World Yo-Yo Contest. Outside of the competition scene, yo-yo players regularly share videos of their yo-yo tricks on the Internet; a common place players do so is on Instagram, using the hashtag &quot;#trickcircle&quot;. Some yo-yo players have also found modest success outside the yo-yo community, going viral on TikTok, gaining significant YouTube followings, or being featured guests on television programs.

== Techniques ==
=== Sleeping ===

The sleeper is one of the most common yo-yo throws and is the basis for nearly all yo-yo throws other than looping. Keeping a yo-yo spinning while remaining at the end of its uncoiled string is known as sleeping. While the yo-yo is in the &quot;sleeping&quot; state at the end of the string, one can then execute tricks like &quot;walk the dog&quot;, &quot;the elevator&quot;, &quot;around the world&quot;, or the slightly more complex &quot;rock the baby&quot;.

The essence of the throw is that one throws the yo-yo with a very pronounced wrist action so that when the yo-yo reaches the end of the string it spins in place rather than rolling back up the string to the thrower&#x27;s hand. Most modern yo-yos have a transaxle or ball bearing to assist this, but if it is a fixed axle yo-yo, the tension must be loose enough to allow this. The two main ways to do this are (1), allow the yo-yo to sit at the bottom of the string to unwind, or (2) perform lariat or UFO to loosen the tension. When one decides to end the &quot;sleeping&quot; state, one merely jerks the wrist and the yo-yo &quot;catches&quot; the string and rolls back up to the hand. Ball-bearing yo-yos with a &quot;butterfly&quot; shape, primarily used for string tricks, frequently have a low response or are completely unresponsive, requiring a &quot;bind&quot; for the yo-yo to return.

In competition, mastery of sleeping is the basis for the 1A division. Inexpensive fixed-axle yo-yos usually spin between 10 and 20 seconds, while the expensive ball bearing yo-yos can spin about 1–4 minutes depending on the throw. , the world record sleep times were 3:51.54 minutes for fixed-axle and 21:15.17 minutes for transaxle yo-yos. In 2012, the transaxle yo-yo sleep time record was broken by the C3YoyoDesign BTH, with a time of 30:28.30 minutes. A traditional sleeper throw is employed to start frontstyle combinations, whereas a sideways sleeper, or &quot;breakaway&quot; is used to start sidestyle combinations.

=== Mounts, transitions, and dismounts ===
Yo-yo tricks in which the yo-yo comes to be sitting a string are called mounts. Transitions are employed to move from one mount to another. Frontstyle mounts include the under and over mounts, as well as the split bottom mount. Sidestyle mounts include the man on the flying trapeze. Combinations can be produced by transitioning from one mount to another in various ways.

Combinations which can repeat indefinitely are called &quot;repeaters&quot;.

=== Loops and Regens ===
Loops are yoyo tricks that consist of the yoyo looping around the throw hand.

A certain class of looping tricks, regens, are tricks that add spin to a yoyo without having to return it to the throwing hand. Because regens switch between frontstyle and sidestyle, they are frequently used to transition between frontstyle and sidestyle combinations.

=== Tricks which adjust string tension ===
Certain tricks, such as the UFO and Sidewinder, can alter the string tension, making it looser or tighter, thereby altering the response of the yo-yo. This also allows for a certain type of trick called slack tricks to be completed with greater ease.

=== Yo-yo notation ===
Several methods of notating yo-yo tricks have been formulated, including a system described Mark Mcbride in his work about yo-yo theory, the Yonomicon. This system is similar to Ross Levine&#x27;s &quot;Modern Yoyo Notation&quot;. Modern yo-yo notation is designed to be ambidextrous, further eschewing terms like &quot;clockwise&quot; and &quot;counterclockwise&quot;.

== Styles ==

=== Unresponsive (1A) ===

Eventually, wider string gaps and silicone response systems led to the innovation of unresponsive yoyoing, otherwise known as 1A. Traditional yoyos (responsive) would return to the hand when one would tug on the string, but unresponsive yoyos behave a little differently. Instead of returning to the hand when one tugs on the string, one has to perform a trick called a &quot;bind&quot; where the string is doubled over inside the string gap to increase friction on the response system. This has brought about innovation of many different kinds of tricks involving leaving slack in the string, as this would have caused a responsive yoyo to return to the hand. This style of yoyoing is the most popular and the most common, and the most yoyo tricks are done with 1A yoyos.

=== Looping (2A) ===

Looping is a yo-yo technique which emphasizes keeping the body of two yo-yos, one on each hand, in constant motion, with or without sleeping.

Yo-yos optimized for looping have weight concentrated in their centers so they may easily rotate about the string&#x27;s axis without their mass contributing to resistance due to a gyroscopic effect.

In yo-yo competitions, looping both to the inside and outside of the hand with the yo-yo plays a strong role in the 2A division. Sometimes the yoyos would wrap around arms, legs, or necks.

Also known as two hands looping freestyle.

=== Two handed string tricks (3A) ===
Two handed or 3A style play involves doing string tricks with two flared bearing yo-yos. Popularized and pioneered by Mark McBride, the first modern Triple A trick appeared in Fiend Magazine and was called the Velvet Rolls. The different mounts in this style are referred to as houses (e.g. &quot;Kink House&quot;).

Photos from as early as the late 1950s show early yo-yo demonstrators performing very basic 3A tricks, such as a Sleeper with one hand, and a Trapeze with the other. While 3A as a concept has existed for many years, it was not until the debut of Velvet Rolls, coupled with the rise of unresponsive yoyo play, that development began on what is currently considered Triple A. This is the most complex style and is the most likely to obtain knots, dings, and clangs.

In competition, two handed string tricks have the 3A division.

=== Off-string (4A) ===
In the &quot;off-string&quot; technique, the yo-yo&#x27;s string is not tied directly to the yo-yo&#x27;s axle, and the yo-yo is usually launched into the air by performing a &quot;forward pass&quot; to be caught again on the string. However, some players can &#x27;throw down&#x27; off-string yo-yos and catch it on the string just as it leaves the end of the string by pivoting the string around a finger as it unwinds, so that the yo-yo is caught on the string. This is exactly the opposite of a &quot;forward pass&quot;, but with the same result.

Yo-yos optimized for off-string tricks have flared designs, like the butterfly shape, which makes it easier to land on the string, and often have soft rubber rings on the edges, so minimum damage is inflicted on the yo-yo, the player, or anyone who happens to be standing nearby, should a trick go wrong. There are also tricks which involve the use of two off-string yoyos at the same time, thrown with the same hand, this is known as &quot;soloham&quot;.

Yo-yo competitions have the 4A division for off-string tricks.

=== Freehand (5A) ===
In freehand tricks, the yo-yo&#x27;s string is not tied to the player&#x27;s hand, instead ending in a counterweight. The counterweight is then thrown from hand to hand and used as an additional element in the trick.

Developed in 1999 by Steve Brown, as of 2008 freehand is considered to be the fastest-growing style of yo-yo play. Steve Brown was awarded a patent on his freehand yo-yo system, which was assigned to Flambeau Products (Duncan&#x27;s parent company). Duncan patented the counterweight, and no one was able to design a unique weight. However, since March 28, 2020, the patent has expired.

In yo-yo competitions, counterweight yo-yos are emphasized in the 5A division.

=== Modern Responsive (0A) ===
Modern responsive yo-yo can be thought of as 2A with a single yoyo, but differs from 2A in the fact that it, like 1A, has access to tricks involving the use of the free hand. Unlike 1A, modern responsive deliberately abstains from tricks that involve sleeping, frequently replacing mounts with stalls.

== Physical mechanism ==
When the yo-yo is first released, the gravity (and the throw) give it translational kinetic energy and necessarily, since the string must unwind, much of this energy is converted into rotational kinetic energy establishing the free movement of the yo-yo, and causing it to spin rapidly. As the yo-yo unwinds downward, it also converts potential energy from gravity to translational energy in its rotation to overcome gravity all the way back up to the hand.

Because the sense of spinning does not change during the whole move, the string winds up in the opposite direction upon the return of the yo-yo. If the shaft of the yo-yo is connected to the string with a loop, there may not be enough frictional force to overcome the weight of the yo-yo, which is necessary to begin winding up the string. In this case, the yo-yo will continue to spin in the loop at the end of the string (or &quot;sleep&quot;), just being slightly braked by the small dynamic friction, instead of returning. However, if the string is jerked slightly up, or the hand is lowered, the slack created in the string will allow it to begin winding around the shaft, thereby increasing friction and allowing it to catch as the static friction force rises above the gravitation force holding the yo-yo at the bottom of the string, making the yo-yo wind up the string returning to the hand.

Patents have been issued to create more complicated mechanisms to allow tension control and an adjustable mechanism.

== Purported use as weapons ==
There is no sound historical evidence that yo-yos were ever used as weapons; the notion is believed to have been a marketing gimmick disseminated by Duncan yo-yo demonstrators in the early years of the company. Regardless, the notion that yo-yos can be used as weapons persists to this day in pop culture, as in the Chinese television series &quot;Blazing Teens&quot;, and in the Japanese &quot;Guilty Gear&quot; franchise by the character Bridget (whose giant yo-yo&#x27;s movements were a considerable challenge to animate). The popular sandbox adventure game Terraria features many yo-yo weapons.

<doc id="104525" wikidata="Q336247" url="?curid=104525" title="Justo José de Urquiza">
<text>Justo José de Urquiza y García (; October 18, 1801 – April 11, 1870) was an Argentine general and politician who served as president of the Argentine Confederation from 1854 to 1860.

==Life==
Justo José de Urquiza y García was born in Entre Ríos, the son of José Narciso de Urquiza Álzaga, born in Castro Urdiales, Spain, and María Cándida García González, a Creole of Buenos Aires. He was governor of Entre Ríos during the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas, governor of Buenos Aires with powers delegated from the other provinces. Rosas presented a resignation to his charge frequently, but only as a political gesture, counting that the other governments would reject it. However, in 1851, resentful of the economic and political dominance of Buenos Aires, Urquiza accepted Rosas&#x27; resignation and resumed for Entre Rios the powers delegated in Buenos Aires. Along with the resuming of international commerce without passing through the port of Buenos Aires, Urquiza replaced the &quot;Death to the savage unitarians!&quot; slogan with &quot;Death to the enemies of national organization!&quot;, requesting the making of a national constitution that Rosas had long rejected. Corrientes supported Urquiza&#x27;s action, but Rosas and the other provinces condemned the &quot;crazy, traitor, savage, unitarian&quot; Urquiza. Supported by Brazil and the Uruguayan liberals, he created the Grand Army and forced Manuel Oribe to capitulate, ending the long siege of Montevideo in October 1851, and finally defeating Rosas on 3 February 1852 at the Battle of Caseros. The other provinces that supported Rosas against Urquiza&#x27;s pronunciation changed sides and supported his project of creating a National Constitution.

Urquiza immediately began the task of national organization. He became provisional director of the Argentine Confederation in May 1852. In 1853, a constituent assembly adopted a constitution based primarily on the ideas of Juan Bautista Alberdi, and Urquiza was inaugurated president in March 1854.

During his administration, foreign relations were improved, public education was encouraged, colonization was promoted, and plans for railroad construction was initiated. His work of national organization was, however, hindered by the opposition of Buenos Aires, which seceded from the Confederation. Open war broke out in 1859. Urquiza defeated the provincial army led by Bartolomé Mitre in October 1859, at the Battle of Cepeda, and Buenos Aires agreed to re-enter the Confederation.

Constitutional amendments proposed by Buenos Aires were adopted in 1860 but the settlement was short-lived, and further difficulties culminated in civil war. Urquiza met the army of Buenos Aires, again led by Mitre, in September 1861. The battle was indecisive, but Urquiza withdrew from the field, leaving the victory with Mitre. He retired to San José Palace, his residence in Entre Ríos, where he ruled until he was assassinated at age 69 (along with his sons Justo and Waldino) by followers of dissident and political rival Ricardo López Jordán.

Like many other nineteenth century Argentine patriots, Urquiza was a freemason. His imposing Palacio San José has been interpreted as containing many masonic symbols, created &quot;to symbolize and reflect the construction of his other work: the Argentine State&quot;.

==Tributes==
There are many streets, parks and squares all over Argentina that are named after Justo José de Urquiza, such as the Urquiza park in Rosario or the Urquiza park in Parana City. There is a central street in Rosario called Urquiza, and there is a commuter railway line in Buenos Aires named after him, the Urquiza Line. The Colegio del Uruguay, founded by Urquiza, was later renamed in his honor.

<text>Anandamide (ANA), also referred to as &quot;N&quot;-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) is a fatty acid neurotransmitter belonging to the fatty acid derivative group known as N-acylethanolamine (NAE). Anandamide takes its name from the Sanskrit word &quot;ananda&quot;, meaning &quot;joy, bliss, delight,&quot; plus amide. Anandamide, the first discovered endocannabinoid, engages with the body&#x27;s endocannabinoid system by binding to the same cannabinoid receptors that THC found in cannabis acts on. Anandamide can be found within tissues in a wide range of animals. It has also been found in plants, such as the cacao tree.

Anandamide is derived from the non-oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid, an essential omega-6 fatty acid. It is synthesized from &quot;N&quot;-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine by multiple pathways. It is degraded primarily by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme, which converts anandamide into ethanolamine and arachidonic acid. As such, inhibitors of FAAH lead to elevated anandamide levels and are being pursued for possible therapeutic use.

== Discovery ==
Anandamide was discovered by Raphael Mechoulam and fellow coworkers in 1992. This was the first marijuana-like substance produced by the human body to be observed. By examining a pig brain and canine gut, they were able to isolate ANA using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. ANA works within the system of the brain associated with the feeling of reward, and as such, has been the topic of many research studies. Since the 1992 findings, many studies have been completed to examine ANA further, including research on behavioral and molecular effects.

== Research ==
According to in vitro research, anandamide effects are mediated primarily by CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the central nervous system, and CB2 cannabinoid receptors in the periphery. The latter appear to be involved in functions of the immune system. Cannabinoid receptors were originally discovered as sensitive to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC, commonly called THC), which is the primary psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis. The discovery of anandamide came from research into CB1 and CB2, as it was inevitable that a naturally occurring (endogenous) chemical would be found to affect these receptors.

Anandamide is under research for its potential involvement in the implantation of the early stage embryo in its blastocyst form into the uterus. Therefore, cannabinoids such as Δ9-THC might influence processes during the earliest stages of human pregnancy. Peak plasma anandamide occurs at ovulation and positively correlates with peak estradiol and gonadotrophin levels, suggesting that these may be involved in the regulation of anandamide levels. Subsequently, anandamide has been proposed as a biomarker of infertility, but so far lacks any predictive values in order to be used clinically.

===Behavior===
Both the CB1 and CB2 receptors (the binding site of anandamide) are under research for a possible role in positive and negative interpretation of environment and setting. The binding relationship of anandamide and the CB1/CB2 may affect neurotransmission of dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and glutamate.

Endocannabinoids may disturb homeostasis in several ways: by enhancing hunger sensations, encouraging increased food intake, and shifting energy balance towards energy storage. A resultant decrease in energy expenditure is observed.

Cortical glutamatergic transmission may be modulated by endocannabinoids during stress and fear habituation.

===Obesity and liver disease===
Blockade of CB1 receptors was found to improve lipid resistance and lipid profile in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Elevated anandamide levels are found in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis.

===Topical effects===

The American Academy of Dermatology has named topical anandamide a promising therapy for cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

== Biosynthesis ==
In humans, anandamide is biosynthesized from &quot;N&quot;-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). In turn, NAPE arises by transfer of arachidonic acid from lecithin to the free amine of cephalin through an &quot;N&quot;-acyltransferase enzyme. Anandamide synthesis from NAPE occurs via multiple pathways and includes enzymes such as phospholipase A2, phospholipase C and N-acetylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolysing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), with other key enzymes yet to be identified.

The crystal structure of NAPE-PLD in complex with phosphatidylethanolamine and deoxycholate shows how the cannabinoid anandamide is generated from membrane &quot;N&quot;-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs), and reveals that bile acids – which are mainly involved in the absorption of lipids in the small intestine – modulate its biogenesis.

== Metabolism ==

Endogenous anandamide is present at very low levels and has a very short half-life due to the action of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which breaks it down into free arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. Studies of piglets show that dietary levels of arachidonic acid and other essential fatty acids affect the levels of anandamide and other endocannabinoids in the brain. High fat diet feeding in mice increases levels of anandamide in the liver and increases lipogenesis. Anandamide may be relevant to the development of obesity, at least in rodents.

Paracetamol (known as acetaminophen in the US and Canada) is metabolically combined with arachidonic acid by FAAH to form AM404. This metabolite is a potent agonist at the TRPV1 vanilloid receptor, a weak agonist at both CB1 and CB2 receptors, and an inhibitor of anandamide reuptake. Consequently, anandamide levels in the body and brain are elevated. Thus, paracetamol acts as a pro-drug for a cannabimimetic metabolite, which may be partially or fully responsible for its analgesic effects.

Black pepper contains the alkaloid guineesine, which is an anandamide reuptake inhibitor. It may therefore increase anandamide&#x27;s physiological effects.

== Transport ==

Endocannabinoid transporters for anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol include the heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs).

Anandamide shows a preference for binding to cholesterol and ceramide over other membrane lipids. Cholesterol acts as a binding partner for anandamide. Initially, a hydrogen bond facilitates their interaction. Following this, anandamide is drawn towards the membrane interior, where it forms a molecular complex with cholesterol. This process involves a conformational adaptation of anandamide to the apolar membrane environment. Subsequently, the anandamide-cholesterol complex is directed to the cannabinoid receptor (CB1) and then exits.

<text>Leda , also known as , is a prograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by Charles T. Kowal at the Mount Palomar Observatory on September 14, 1974, after three nights&#x27; worth of photographic plates had been taken (September 11 through 13; Leda appears on all of them). It was named after Leda, who was raped by Zeus, the Greek equivalent of Jupiter (who came to her in the form of a swan). Kowal suggested the name and the IAU endorsed it in 1975.

Leda belongs to the Himalia group, moons orbiting between 11 and 13 Gm from Jupiter at an inclination of about 27.5°. The orbital elements given here are as of January 2021, but they are continuously changing due to solar and planetary perturbations.

<text>In Greek mythology, Leda (; Ancient Greek: Λήδα ) was an Aetolian princess who became a Spartan queen. According to Ovid, she was famed for her beautiful black hair and snowy skin. Her myth gave rise to the popular motif in Renaissance and later art of Leda and the Swan.

== Family ==

Leda was the daughter of the Aetolian King Thestius hence she was also called Thestias. Her mother was possibly Leucippe, Deidameia, daughter of Perieres, Eurythemis, daughter of Cleoboea, or Laophonte, daughter of Pleuron. According to Alcman, Leda&#x27;s parents were Glaucus and Laophonte while Eumelus attested that they are Sisyphus and Panteiduia or Paneidyia.

She married king Tyndareus of Sparta and by him became the mother of Helen of Troy, Clytemnestra, Castor, and Pollux (also called &quot;Polydeuces&quot;). Leda also had three other daughters by Tyndareus: Timandra, Phoebe, and Philonoe.

== Mythology ==
Leda was admired by Zeus, who seduced her in the guise of a swan. As a swan, Zeus fell into her arms for protection from a pursuing eagle. Their consummation, on the same night as Leda lay with her husband Tyndareus, resulted in two eggs from which hatched Helen (later known as the beautiful &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;), Clytemnestra, and Castor and Pollux (also known as the Dioscuri). Which children are the progeny of Tyndareus the mortal king, and which are of Zeus and thus half-immortal, is not consistent among accounts, nor is which child hatched from which egg. The split is almost always half mortal, half divine, although the pairings do not always reflect the children&#x27;s heritage pairings. Castor and Pollux are sometimes both mortal, sometimes both divine. One consistent point is that if only one of them is immortal, it is Pollux. It is also always stated that Helen is the daughter of Zeus.

In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Helen looks down from the walls of Troy and wonders why she does not see her brothers among the Achaeans. The narrator remarks that they are both already dead and buried back in their homeland of Lacedaemon, thus suggesting that at least in the Homeric tradition, both were mortal.

Another account of the myth states that Nemesis (Νέμεσις) was the mother of Helen, and was also impregnated by Zeus in the guise of a swan. A shepherd found the egg and gave it to Leda, who carefully kept it in a chest until the egg hatched. When the egg hatched, Leda adopted Helen as her daughter. Zeus also commemorated the birth of Helen by creating the constellation Cygnus (Κύκνος), the Swan, in the sky.

== In art ==

Leda and the Swan, Leda and the Egg, and Leda with her children were popular subjects in ancient art. In the post-classical arts, it became a potent source of inspiration. It is the subject of William Butler Yeats&#x27; poem Leda and the Swan. She is also the main subject in Honoré Desmond Sharrer&#x27;s &quot;Leda &amp; the Folks&quot;, a large painting focusing as well on the parents of entertainer Elvis Presley and currently located at the Smith College Museum of Art.

Australian artist Sidney Nolan produced at least a dozen interpretations of Leda and the Swan in the 1950s and 1960s, connected with his work on the myths of the Trojan War and World War I.

In October 2022, the myth inspired Hozier to write a song in response to the &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson&quot; decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, which repealed &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. The song is called &quot;Swan Upon Leda&quot;.

<text>Tigris and Euphrates () is a tabletop eurogame designed by Reiner Knizia and first published in 1997 by Hans im Glück. Before its publication, it was highly anticipated by German gamers hearing rumors of a &quot;gamer&#x27;s game&quot; designed by Knizia. &quot;Tigris and Euphrates&quot; won first prize in the 1998 Deutscher Spielepreis. A card game version was released in 2005.

The game is set as a clash between neighboring dynasties at the dawn of civilization and is named after the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, in the region now called the Middle East. The rivers together formed natural borders for an area which harboured several grand ancient civilizations, including Sumer, Babylonia, and Assyria. The Greeks called this area Mesopotamia, which literally means &quot;between the rivers&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The game can be played by two, three, or four people. Play offers both tactical and strategic objectives. As with many games, short-term objectives gain prominence when more players participate, as players have fewer chances to follow up on previous moves. Luck plays a role, as players draw tiles from a bag, but it is seldom decisive. Players may selectively discard and redraw their tiles at the cost of one &quot;action point&quot;, of which each player has two per turn. The game does not use dice.

The board is a map of the two rivers, marked with a square grid. There are four types of tiles with corresponding leaders: temples and priests (red), farms and farmers (blue), markets and merchants (green), and settlements and kings (black). The game starts with ten isolated temple tiles already placed on the board. Players play tiles and leaders onto the board, creating and expanding regions and kingdoms. Monuments may be built on the board when four tiles of the same color are played into a square pattern.

Two leaders of the same type cannot coexist in the same kingdom. Internal conflicts are caused by players adding a second leader of a type to a kingdom. External conflicts are caused by players playing tiles to merge two existing kingdoms.

During the game, players collect points in each of the four colors as a result of playing tiles, resolving conflicts and controlling monuments. After the final round each player sorts his or her points by color, including any &quot;treasures&quot; which they have acquired, which count as any color the player wishes. In order to limit specialization the player with the most points in their weakest category wins.

For example:
*Alice has 6 black, 8 red, 12 green, and 12 blue points; thus has a score of 6.
*Bob has 9 black, 10 red, 7 green, and 15 blue points; thus has a score of 7.
*Charlie has 14 black, 14 red, 5 green, and 20 blue points; thus has a score of 5.

Players must balance their scoring and avoid overspecializing. Knizia later used this mechanism as the basis for Ingenious.

==Reception==
Thomas Lehmann comments: &quot;If you are looking for a tactically rich, intense strategy game with lots of conflict (unusual in a German game), try &quot;Tigris &amp; Euphrates&quot; and see why so many players consider this game Reiner Knizia&#x27;s masterpiece.&quot;

<text>The Salon des Refusés, French for &quot;exhibition of rejects&quot; (), is generally known as an exhibition of works rejected by the jury of the official Paris Salon, but the term is most famously used to refer to the Salon des Refusés of 1863.

Today, by extension, &quot;salon des refusés&quot; refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show.

==Background of the Salon of 1863==
The Paris Salon, sponsored by the French government and the Academy of Fine Arts, took place annually, and was an exhibition of the best academic art. A medal from the Salon was assurance of a successful artistic career; winners were given official commissions by the French government and were sought after for portraits and private commissions. Since the 18th century, the paintings were classified by genre, following a hierarchy; history paintings were ranked first, followed by the portrait, the landscape, the &quot;genre scene&quot; and the still life. The jury, headed by the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, the head of the Academy of Fine Arts, was very conservative; near-photographic but idealized realism was expected.

Much intrigue often went on to get acceptance, and to be given a good place in the galleries. In 1851, Gustave Courbet managed to get one painting into the Salon, &quot;Enterrement à Ornans&quot;, and in 1852 his &quot;Baigneuses&quot; was accepted, scandalizing critics and the public, who expected romanticized nudes in classical settings, but in 1855 the Salon refused all of Courbet&#x27;s paintings. As early as the 1830s, Paris art galleries mounted small, private exhibitions of works rejected by the Salon jurors. Courbet was obliged to organize his own exhibit, called &quot;The Pavillon of Realism&quot;, at a private gallery. Private exhibits attracted far less attention from the press and patrons, and limited the access of the artists to a small public.

In 1863 the Salon jury refused two thirds of the paintings presented, including the works of Gustave Courbet, Édouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Antoine Chintreuil, and Johan Jongkind. The rejected artists and their friends protested, and the protests reached Emperor Napoleon III. The Emperor&#x27;s tastes in art were traditional; he commissioned and bought works by artists such as Alexandre Cabanel and Franz Xaver Winterhalter, but he was also sensitive to public opinion. His office issued a statement: &quot;Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition. His Majesty, wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints, has decided that the works of art which were refused should be displayed in another part of the Palace of Industry.&quot;

More than a thousand visitors a day visited the Salon des Refusés. The journalist Émile Zola reported that visitors pushed to get into the crowded galleries where the refused paintings were hung, and the rooms were full of the laughter of the spectators. Critics and the public ridiculed the &quot;refusés&quot;, which included such famous paintings as Édouard Manet&#x27;s &quot;Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; and James McNeill Whistler&#x27;s &quot;Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl&quot;. The critical attention also legitimized the emerging avant-garde in painting. The Impressionists exhibited their works outside the traditional Salon beginning in 1874. Subsequent Salons des Refusés were mounted in Paris in 1874, 1875, and 1886, by which time the popularity of the Paris Salon had declined for those who were more interested in Impressionism.

==Works in the exhibition==

===&quot;Le déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;===
Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit &quot;Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés. &quot;Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; depicts the juxtaposition of a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather in the background, on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. The painting sparked public notoriety and stirred up controversy and has remained controversial, even to this day. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in Proust&#x27;s &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;.

One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution in the &quot;Bois de Boulogne&quot;, a large park at the western outskirts of Paris, at the time. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.

Émile Zola comments about &quot;Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;:

&quot;The Luncheon on the Grass&quot; is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. My God! What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! That has never been seen. And this belief is a gross error, for in the Louvre there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging &quot;The Luncheon on the Grass&quot; like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience. Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of &quot;The Luncheon on the Grass&quot; is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.

Émile Zola incorporated a fictionalized account of the 1863 scandal in his novel &quot;L&#x27;Œuvre&quot; &quot;(The Masterpiece)&quot; (1886).

===&quot;Symphony in White no 1&quot;===
In 1861, after returning to Paris for a time, James Abbott McNeill Whistler painted his first famous work, &quot;Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl&quot;. This portrait of his mistress and business manager Joanna Hiffernan was created as a simple study in white; however, others saw it differently. The critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary thought the painting an allegory of a new bride&#x27;s lost innocence. Others linked it to Wilkie Collins&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in White&quot;, a popular novel of the time, or various other literary sources. In England, some considered it a painting in the Pre-Raphaelite manner. In the painting, Hiffernan holds a lily in her left hand and stands upon a wolf skin rug (interpreted by some to represent masculinity and lust) with the wolf&#x27;s head staring menacingly at the viewer.

Countering criticism by traditionalists, Whistler&#x27;s supporters insisted that the painting was &quot;an apparition with a spiritual content&quot; and that it epitomized his theory that art should be concerned essentially with the arrangement of colors in harmony, not with a literal portrayal of the natural world.

Whistler started working on &quot;The White Girl&quot; shortly after December 3, 1861, with the intention of submitting it to the prestigious annual exhibition of the Royal Academy. In spite of bouts of illness, he finished the painting by April. The white paint Whistler used contained lead, and his work on the seven-foot-high canvas had given the artist a dose of lead poisoning. The portrait was refused for exhibition at the conservative Royal Academy in London. Whistler then submitted the painting to the Paris Salon of 1863, where it was also rejected. The public was able to see the painting exhibited with other rejected works, in the Salon des Refusés. The Salon des Refusés was an event sanctioned by Emperor Napoleon III, to appease the large number of artists who joined forces to protest the harsh jury decisions in 1863 Of the over 5,000 paintings submitted in 1863, 2,217 were rejected. 

In a letter to George du Maurier in early 1862 Whistler wrote of the painting:

Whistler submitted the painting to the Academy, but according to Joanna Hiffernan, he expected it to be rejected. The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. Edwin Henry Landseer&#x27;s &quot;The Shrew Tamed&quot; showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert, a noted equestrienne of the period, however it was soon rumored that it was actually Catherine Walters, the notorious London courtesan. Whistler&#x27;s painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer&#x27;s that the judges were wary of admitting it. &quot;White Girl&quot; was submitted to the Academy along with three etchings, all three of which were accepted, while the painting was not. Whistler exhibited it at the small Berners Street Gallery in London instead. The next year, Whistler tried to have the painting exhibited at the &quot;Salon&quot; in Paris – the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts – but it was rejected there as well. Instead, it was accepted at the alternative &quot;Salon des Refusés&quot; – the &quot;exhibition of rejects&quot; that opened on May 15, two weeks after the official &quot;Salon&quot;.

Although Whistler&#x27;s painting was widely noticed, he was upstaged by Manet&#x27;s more shocking painting &quot;Le déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;. The controversy surrounding the paintings was described in Émile Zola&#x27;s novel &quot;L&#x27;Œuvre&quot; (1886). The reception Whistler&#x27;s painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris. The painting was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter Gustave Courbet and the poet Charles Baudelaire. The art critic Théophile Thoré-Bürger saw it in the tradition of Goya and Velázquez. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.

==Legacy==
Art historian Albert Boime wrote: &quot;The Salon des Refusés introduced the democratic concept of a multi-style system (much like a multi-party system) subject to the review of the general jury of the public.&quot;

<doc id="104543" wikidata="Q1195015" url="?curid=104543" title="Ternary form">
<text>Ternary form, sometimes called song form, is a three-part musical form consisting of an opening section (A), a following section (B) and then a repetition of the first section (A). It is usually schematized as A–B–A. Prominent examples include the da capo aria &quot;The trumpet shall sound&quot; from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, Chopin&#x27;s Prelude in D-Flat Major &quot;Raindrop&quot;, (Op. 28) and the opening chorus of Bach&#x27;s &quot;St John Passion&quot;.

==Simple ternary form==
In ternary form each section is self-contained both thematically as well as tonally (that is, each section contains distinct and complete themes), and ends with an authentic cadence. The B section is generally in a contrasting but closely related key, usually a perfect fifth above or the parallel minor of the home key of the A section (V or i); however, in many works of the Classical period, the B section stays in tonic but has contrasting thematic material. It usually also has a contrasting character; for example section A might be stiff and formal while the contrasting B section would be melodious and flowing.

===Da capo aria===

Baroque opera arias and a considerable number of baroque sacred music arias was dominated by the &quot;Da capo&quot; aria which were in the ABA form. A frequent model of the form began with a long A section in a major key, a short B section in a relative minor key mildly developing the thematic material of the A section and then a repetition of the A section. By convention in the third section (the repeat of section A after section B) soloists may add some ornamentation or short improvised variations. In later classical music such changes may have been written into the score. In these cases the last section is sometimes labeled A’ or A1 to indicate that it is slightly different from the first A section.

==Compound ternary or trio form==

In a trio form each section is a dance movement in binary form (two sub-sections which are each repeated) and a contrasting trio movement also in binary form with repeats. An example is the minuet and trio from Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Surprise Symphony&quot;. The minuet consists of one section (1A) which is repeated and a second section (1B) which is also repeated. The trio section follows the same format (2A repeated and 2B repeated). The complete minuet is then played again at the end of the trio represented as: . By convention in the second rendition of the minuet, the sections are not repeated with the scheme . The trio may also be referred to as a double or as I/II, such as in Bach&#x27;s polonaise and double (or Polonaise I/II) from his second orchestral suite and his Bourrée and double (or Bourrée I/II) from his second English Suite for harpsichord.

The scherzo and trio, which is identical in structure to other trio forms, developed in the late Classical and early Romantic periods. Examples include the scherzo and trio (second movement) from Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 and the scherzo and trio in Schubert&#x27;s String Quintet. Another name for the latter is &quot;composite ternary form&quot;.

Trio form movements (especially scherzos) written from the early romantic era sometimes include a short coda (a unique ending to complete the entire movement) and possibly a short introduction. The second movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 is written in this style which can be diagrammed as 

Quickstep military marches, in particular, many marches by John Philip Sousa follow this form, and the middle section is called the &quot;trio&quot;. 

Polkas are also often in compound-ternary form.

===Quasi compound form===

Occasionally the A section or B section of a dance like movement is not divided into two repeating parts. For example, in the Minuet in Haydn&#x27;s String Quartet op. 76 no. 6, the Minuet is in standard binary form (section A and B) while the trio is in free form and not in two repeated sections. Haydn labeled the B section &quot;Alternative&quot;, a label used in some Baroque pieces (though most such pieces were in proper compound ternary form).

==Ternary form within a ternary form==
In a complex ternary form each section is itself in ternary form in the scheme of By convention each part is repeated and only on its first rendition: . An example are the Impromptus (Op. 7) by Jan Voříšek.

Expanded ternary forms are especially common among Romantic-era composers; for example, Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Military&quot; Polonaise (Op. 40, No. 1) is in the form , where the A and B sections and C and D sections are repeated as a group, and the original theme returning at the end without repeats.

<text>Five Points is a town in Chambers County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 114.

==History==
In 1885, Five Points was named because of the five roads converging at a single point. Before this, the post office was known as &quot;Lystra&quot;. The town was incorporated in 1915, making it Chambers County&#x27;s oldest incorporated town. The Baptist Church was the first to take the name of &quot;Five Points&quot; on its building in 1929.

Five Points holds the distinction of being the first town of its size to receive electricity from Alabama Power in 1925. In order to receive power, citizens were required to erect their own poles from Stroud to White Plains.

Five Points is home to the first consolidated high school in Alabama. The original Five Points High School was an imposing brick building which had two floors above a full basement and a large auditorium that seated 400 people. Erected in 1916 on an campus, it was the only rural school in the state with its own electric and steam-generating plant and water works. The school building was replaced by a one-story building in 1939. In 1974 a fire destroyed that structure which was replaced by the present building.

The town elected its first African-American mayor, Geneva Bledsoe, in 1992. The current mayor is Jeffrey Monroe, who was appointed Mayor in 2022 when former mayor Derrick Wright moved out of the town limits.

<text>LaFayette ( , ) is the county seat of Chambers County, Alabama, United States, northwest of Columbus, Georgia. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 3,003.

==History==
Chambers County was formed in 1832. The newly elected county officials opted to locate the county seat as near as possible to the center of the county. Lots for the new town were auctioned in October 1833, with proceeds from the sale financing the construction of a courthouse and jail. The town was first called &quot;Chambersville&quot;, but by the time of incorporation on January 7, 1835, the town name had been changed to &quot;Lafayette&quot;, named after the Marquis de Lafayette; its spelling was changed to &quot;LaFayette&quot; due to the influence of newspaper editor Johnson J. Hooper, who created a fictional character called Captain Simon Suggs, a backwoods southerner who pronounced the town&#x27;s name as &quot;La Fait&quot;. The city&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The LaFayette Sun&quot;, was founded under the name &quot;The Alabama Standard&quot; in April 1841 and adopted its current name on August 3, 1881.

<text>Clanton is a city in Chilton County, Alabama, United States. It is part of the Birmingham–Hoover–Cullman Combined Statistical Area. At the 2020 census, the population was . The city is the county seat of Chilton County. Clanton is near the site of the geographic center of the U.S. state of Alabama.

==History==
The area that would become Clanton was known as &quot;Goose Pond&quot; and nearby &quot;Ranch&quot; when Baker County (later renamed Chilton County) was founded on December 30, 1868. Soon thereafter (May 1871) the town of Clanton took its name from the South and North Alabama Railroad station of that name. A couple of actions solidified the name of the town. First, during the Alabama Legislative actions to allow the vote to set the permanent location of the courthouse (January - March 1871), their amendments changed the nominated name from &quot;Baker&#x27;s&quot; to &quot;Clanton.&quot; Finalizing the name change was an official application in May 1871 by the Postmaster to the Federal Postal System to re-designate the local Post Office as &quot;Clanton&quot; and terminate the former designation (Goose Pond). The railroad had named &quot;Clanton Station&quot; in honor of James H. Clanton, an attorney, Chairman of the Alabama Democratic Executive committee, and a former Brigadier General in the Confederate States Army. It was incorporated on April 23, 1873. Alfred Baker was also elected first mayor of the town.

Nearby Mitchell Dam became Alabama Power&#x27;s first two dams in the state, bringing economic improvements to the area. Immigrants played a part in starting the county&#x27;s peach industry more than a century ago.

Residents and businesspeople from the original Maplesville began moving closer to the railroad, and when the Maplesville Post Office was relocated to the railroad town in 1856, the new town was renamed Maplesville.
The original town site gradually became deserted, and all that remains today is the Old Maplesville Cemetery.

Maplesville continued to prosper after the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad ran a line through the town 
In 1901, a lumber mill opened near the town, and the town&#x27;s population grew as people moved to Maplesville to work at the mill.
Maplesville incorporated in 1914, but the incorporation soon lapsed because the town failed to hold elections after the initial round.
It reincorporated in 1947, and by 1951 had established a telephone system, garbage pick-up, and water system.

A new town hall was completed in 1975.

=== Historic sites ===

There are four historic sites currently listed in Maplesville.

==== Maplesville Depot ====
Maplesville&#x27;s first railroad depot was constructed when the Alabama and Tennessee River Railroad arrived in 1853.
In 1865, the depot was destroyed in a raid by Union general James H. Wilson, as Wilson&#x27;s Raiders marched on to Selma.
It was replaced soon after the Civil War, but was destroyed by fire in 1911.
The fire had begun at a building owned by a local merchant, R. H. Martin, and had spread to several nearby wood-frame structures, one of which was the depot.
It was reconstructed in 1912 and has continued to stand thereafter.

The Maplesville High School was accredited in 1932.
Before then, children had to take the train to and from Plantersville, the location of the Dallas County High School.
It cost for a book of one month&#x27;s worth of return tickets for a student on the number 19 train.
Dallas County High arranged for its classes to begin after the arrival of the train from Maplesville, with local students attending a study hall in the morning until the others arrived.

By 2022 the Depot was being used as a senior citizen recreation centre.
It had been remodelled with new kitchens and restrooms for use in a meals on wheels program for senior citizens as part of the celebrations of the United States Bicentennial in 1976.
Of the GM&amp;O railroad, only the railbed remains.

==== Old Maplesville Cemetery ====

The Old Maplesville Cemetery, at the site of the original Maplesville, is located along what is now Highway 191.

This cemetery is also home to the oldest grave in Chilton County, dating back to 1833.

During the construction of Highway 191, several of the graves were destroyed during the process.

==History==

Thorsby is a small Central Alabama town located in Chilton County. Thorsby was first settled in 1895 and incorporated in 1901 by Scandinavian immigrants who had originally settled in the midwestern United States, but who were seeking a milder climate and fertile soil for growing food. One of those earliest settlers was Theodore T. Thorson, for whom the town was eventually named (the suffix &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;settlement&quot; in Scandinavian languages). The town grew quickly, with two hotels, a sawmill and lumber company, and two wineries being built within the first couple of years. The town of Thorsby was declared a promised land for northerners looking to relocate to a warmer climate, suitable for farming and better health. The fertile soil of the South produced grapes in large numbers, along with other fruits such as strawberries, and the peaches for which Chilton County is famous. The founders formed the Concordia Land and Improvement Association and began advertising in New England newspapers about the &quot;utopia&quot; they had discovered in the Southeastern United States. Many traveled by railroad to purchase a tract of land and start a better life. Thorsby became affectionately known as the little &quot;Swede town&quot; by locals.

Thorsby is located almost exactly between the downtown areas of Birmingham and Montgomery, with either destination being approximately from the center of town.

Each autumn, the town of Thorsby celebrates its heritage with the Annual Swedish Festival that includes an arts and crafts fair, a pageant, music, car and motorcycle shows and food native to the American South. The town maintains the old Norwegian Lutheran Church, now called &quot;Helen Jenkins Chapel&quot;. It is a venue available for public use. A Scandinavian Cemetery is available for visits any time. The town operates its own police and fire departments, as well as departments of building inspection, law, parks and recreation, and the Thorsby Water Works. The Chilton County School System operates the K-12 Thorsby School in the town.

==Thorsby High School==

Thorsby High School is a 3-A, K-12 educational institution. It has been a public school since 1957. The school originated as Thorsby Institute shortly after the town was founded in the early 1900s. Thorsby Institute was founded as a private school and was turned over to the Chilton County Board of Education to become a part of the public school system. Thorsby Institute provided a quality education for many years to local and out-of-state students.

There is an old school house in central Thorsby, which was in use until the mid-1970s.

<doc id="104573" wikidata="Q79885" url="?curid=104573" title="Thomasville, Alabama">
<text>Thomasville is a city in Clarke County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 3,649. Founded as a late 19th-century railroad town, it has transitioned over the course of more than a century into a 21st-century commercial hub. It is the childhood hometown of author and storyteller Kathryn Tucker Windham.

==History==
Thomasville was founded in 1888 and incorporated on November 24 of that year. The former community of Choctaw Corner, dating back to the antebellum period, was a settlement west of what would become Thomasville, but when the merchants there learned that a railroad was going to bypass their town to the east, they decided to move their stores to be near the railroad. The former community is now inside the city limits. The tracks between Mobile and Selma were completed the same year that Thomasville began. First referred to as &quot;Choctaw&quot;, the town was named after railroad financier and former Union Civil War general, Samuel Russell Thomas, after he donated $500 for the construction of Thomasville&#x27;s first school. The town had expanded by the end of the 19th century with numerous stores, several hotels and boarding houses, and a depot station. In 1899, what is now downtown was destroyed by a fire that burned several blocks of the wood frame buildings. Thomasville quickly rebuilt, this time in brick, and was once again flourishing by the start of World War I.

Over the next century, Thomasville continued to grow and expand. Over the years, many businesses came and others left. These included garment factories, sawmills, and cotton gins. The railroad discontinued its use of the town&#x27;s depot by the 1950s, but that time also saw the opening of Thomasville&#x27;s FPS-35 radar base, part of the Air Defense Command&#x27;s Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, bringing in servicemen and their families. The prototype for the FPS-35 radar was developed at the Thomasville Aircraft Control and Warning Station. The 1950s also saw the planting of roses along Highway 43, the main highway through Thomasville, earning it the nickname of The City of Roses. The 1960s and 1970s saw the opening of numerous paper mills in the area, an industry that continues to be important to the economy of Thomasville today. This time also saw businesses begin to relocate from downtown to the main highway. The Thomasville Historic District was designated in 1999 by the National Register of Historic Places.

Thomasville had one acute care hospital, Southwest Alabama Medical Center, with 50 licensed beds. In 2009 the hospital&#x27;s owner, Anne Thompson, and city leaders announced plans for a new hospital facility near Thomasville&#x27;s South Industrial Park, the first new rural hospital in Alabama in 30 years. The new facility was projected to cost $35 million and employ roughly 200 people. However, the facility permanently closed its doors on August 16, 2011. Despite generating revenues in excess of $24.3 million for the year ending in March 2010, the facility lost more than half of a million dollars during the same period. A statement released to the public after closing stated that the hospital had not made enough money to cover operating expenses. The director of the Alabama Department of Public Health confirmed that the facility had turned in its operating license on August 16. In 2020, it was announced that due to the presence of asbestos, the old hospital building would be demolished and the old property redeveloped.

<text>Ashland is a city in and the county seat of Clay County, Alabama, United States. The population was 2,037 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Clay County was formed by an act of the Alabama General Assembly on December 7, 1866. Less than a year later, Ashland was established as the county seat on land donated by Hollingsworth Watts for the construction of a courthouse. In 1871 Ashland was incorporated and named for 19th century statesman Henry Clay&#x27;s Kentucky estate home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashland/Clay County, Alabama&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early years, the town grew very rapidly. The town continued to grow with the opening of Alabama&#x27;s first graphite mine in 1899. When World War I ended, the market for graphite dropped drastically, thus ending the town&#x27;s growth phase.

The 1930s brought the Great Depression and boll weevil to Ashland that destroyed the cotton industry. Farmers were forced to abandon what had been the community&#x27;s major industry. Timber, poultry, and cabinet making became the dominant industries by the beginning of the 21st century.

<text>Lineville is a city in Clay County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 2,489.

==History==

Native Americans were the first to inhabit the area now known as Lineville. The Creek Indian War of 1813, however, resulted in their removal. The first white settlers in the area were William and Thomas Lundie. Their settlement became known as Lundie&#x27;s Cross Roads after a trading post opened in the 1830s to serve pioneers and miners searching for gold. In 1856, Lundie&#x27;s Cross Roads became known as County Line, probably for the Baptist Church, founded in 1848 and located on what was then the boundary line between Talladega and Randolph counties. Also in 1856, a post office was established in County Line, schools were consolidated and corn and cotton became cash crops.

The Town of (Crooked Creek) Lineville was built on what was at that time the dividing line between Talladega and Randolph Counties, hence the name, Lineville. John H. Ingram, Sr. of Lineville, Alabama furnishes the following early history: “Crooked Creek Baptist Church, later Lineville, was organized in 1839 and built one and one quarter miles west of the town of Lineville about 200 yards northwest of the home of Frank Pittard; and the first literary school of the community was nearby. Some years later the church was moved a short distance and a house was built on the left side of the public road near the residence of the late Thomas H. Harris. In about 1863 the church was moved into the town of Lineville and a house built just west of the present grammar school building; the name was changed to Lineville Baptist Church in 1881 and legally incorporated in 1912; the first Circuit Court that was held in the new County of Clay, was held in the Lineville Baptist Church in 1867, with John Henderson of Talladega, Alabama, as a judge. The present new brick building was built in 1915 and 1916, with the first service held on March 1st, 1916, with prayer and thanksgiving service conducted by J.H. Ingram, Sr., and C.N. James, pastor.”

One of the newest attractions in Clay County in the 1920s, was the chicken business. Millions of chickens and eggs and long chicken houses In or about 1921, Reverend Secelar Claxton Ray took one hundred, day-old chicks to the Clay County Fair and put them under an oil burning brooder and called attention to the advantage of using chickens on the farm to supplement the ‘all cotton’ cash crop. This was something new, but it did gradually got the attention of the local farmers. He was now fully in the poultry business, and named it Goodwill Poultry Farm and Hatchery. He bought houses then idle at the local graphite mines in Clay County and hired neighbors in their spare time and built the hatchery and chicken houses and an extra tenant house on the farm, southeast of Ashland, Alabama, whose population of close to one thousand had grown considerably from two hundred in 1881.

<text>Elba is a city in and the county seat of Coffee County, Alabama, United States. It is the official seat, although there are two county courthouses, with the other one being located in the city of Enterprise. At the time of the 2020 US Census, Elba&#x27;s population was 3,508. Elba is part of the Enterprise micropolitan statistical area.

==History==
The town which eventually became Elba originated near a ferry across the Pea River in the early 1830s. Originally called Bridgeville, a U.S. post office was established in the town by 1841. In 1851, a lottery to determine a new name for the town was held. One citizen had been reading a biography of Napoleon Bonaparte, and his suggestion of &quot;Elba&quot; as its name was the winner when it was drawn from a hat before any of the other suggestions. Elba became the county seat of Coffee County in 1852.

A logging railroad first reached Elba on March 20, 1892, with the first permanent rail line arriving in October 1898. The &quot;Dorsey Trailer Company&quot; was constructed at the end of this railroad line, and this company manufactured the highway trailers that served on railroads and highways starting with the piggyback railroad or containerized cargo boom of the second half of the 20th century. The new railroad line ended in West Elba, where the &quot;New Town&quot; industrial section of the town was located. The Seaboard System Railroad ceased all railroad service to Elba, including freight service, on November 27, 1984.

The Pea River is an essential component of the history of Elba. The river was originally called the Talakatchee River by the Creek Indians. (In the Creek language, &quot;talak&quot; means &quot;pea&quot;, and &quot;hatchee&quot; means &quot;small river&quot;.) The Pea River frequently flooded, causing great damage to the town. The Lincoln flood of 1865, named for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in the same year, was the first to destroy the town. Another devastating flood occurred in 1929 when the river crested at a depth of early on March 15. Airplanes were used to drop supplies to the completely inundated town. There was only one death from the flood, an African-American man named &quot;Phoe&quot; Larkins. A child born at the Elba Hotel during this flood was named &quot;Noah Tucker&quot; after the biblical character Noah. Vivian Harper received the Theodore N. Vail Silver Medal for her heroic actions during the flood.

A levee was built around the town in 1930. Flood gates were erected and drainage systems were improved. Floods continued, however, with especially severe inundations in 1938, 1959 and 1975. The worst flood ever recorded in Elba occurred in 1990, with a river crest of . The levee broke and Whitewater Creek overflowed into the town. Elba was completely flooded for four days, and the town was nearly destroyed. More floods struck Elba in 1994 and 1998.

<text>Enterprise is a city in the southeastern part of Coffee County and the southwestern part of Dale County in Southeastern Alabama, United States. Its population was 28,711 at the 2020 census. Enterprise is the primary city of the Enterprise micropolitan statistical area (with the portion of the city in Dale County part of the Ozark micropolitan statistical area). It was originally a part of Enterprise–Ozark micropolitan area before being split; for a longer while it was originally part of the Dothan-Enterprise-Ozark combined statistical area but is now its own separate primary statistical area in later censuses.

Enterprise is famous for the Boll Weevil Monument, a large monument of a woman holding a boll weevil, in the middle of Main Street. The city erected the statue because the destruction of the cotton crop by the boll weevil had led to agricultural diversity, starting with peanuts and more prosperity than had ever come from cotton alone. It is the only statue to an insect pest in the world. Enterprise is right outside the U.S. Army&#x27;s Fort Novosel, the home of Army Aviation.

Enterprise is home to Enterprise State Community College.

==History==
===Founding and the Boll Weevil Monument===

The founder of Enterprise, John Henry Carmichael, first settled there in 1881. Carmichael opened a store, which attracted more settlers to the area, and by the next year, a post office was relocated from the settlement of Drake Eye to the north to Enterprise. In 1896, with 250 people having settled there, the city of Enterprise incorporated. Soon afterward, the Alabama Midland Railway came to Enterprise, bringing with it opportunities for commerce and growth. By 1906, its population had grown to 3,750.
Enterprise&#x27;s way of life came under threat in 1915. An infestation of boll weevils found its way into the region&#x27;s cotton crops, resulting in the destruction of most of the cotton in Coffee County. Facing economic ruin, the nearly bankrupt area farmers were forced to diversify, planting peanuts and other crops in an effort to lessen the damage and recoup some of their losses.
Two years later, Coffee County was the United States&#x27; leading producer of peanuts. Not only did Enterprise stave off disaster, but its economy was renewed by the thriving new crop base. In appreciation, the people of Enterprise erected a monument in the city center to what the monument calls their &quot;herald of prosperity&quot;, the boll weevil. The Boll Weevil Monument was dedicated on December 11, 1919, as a reminder of how the city adjusted in the face of adversity. It is the only monument to an agricultural pest in the world.

===March 2007 tornado===
In the early afternoon of March 1, 2007, Enterprise was struck by a violent EF4 tornado. The tornado caused nine deaths and injured over 121 others. Damage in Enterprise was estimated at nearly $307 million, the worst disaster in the city&#x27;s history.

The most severe damage occurred at Enterprise High School, where eight students died after a hallway was destroyed and the wall collapsed on them. The students were Michael Bowen (16), Andrew (AJ) Jackson (16), Ryan Mohler (16), Peter Dunn lll (16), Michael (Mikey) Tompkins (17), Jamie Vidensek (17), Michelle Wilson (16) and Kathryn Strunk (16). Enterprise resident Edna Strickland was killed in her home near the high school, the ninth fatality from the tornado. A quarter mile-wide swath through the downtown area was devastated, with at least 370 houses damaged or destroyed. The National Guard was called into the city; a dusk-to-dawn curfew was implemented immediately after the disaster. President Bush arrived the morning of March 3 and immediately declared Coffee County a disaster area. An AmeriCorps team was sent to the city to help organize and participate in disaster relief.

After the tornado, Enterprise High School students attended classes at the local community college, where trailers were used as temporary additional classrooms. The high school was rebuilt on a new site on the west end of Boll Weevil Circle and opened on August 23, 2010, at a cost of over $80 million. The new high school has structurally reinforced safe rooms and areas to shelter during severe weather and is rated to withstand winds from an EF5 tornado.

==Point of interest==

Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. Paul Theodore Arlt was an artist with the Section of Fine Arts and painted the post office mural, &quot;The Section&quot;, in the Enterprise post office in 1941. The post office was torn down in 1991, but Arlt&#x27;s mural, &quot;Saturday in Enterprise&quot; was preserved and now hangs in the Enterprise Public Library.

Weevil Way is a community art project with a series of 30 boll weevil statues decorated or dressed to represent the local landmarks or businesses where they stand. One of these statues, specifically the statue named &quot;Ronald McWeevil&quot; located at a local McDonalds, ended up going viral online.

==Media==
A weekly newspaper, &quot;The Southeast Sun&quot;, had been published since 1982 but is no longer publishing. &quot;The Enterprise Ledger&quot; is published Tuesday–Friday and Sunday and has been in circulation since 1898.

==Music==
The song &quot;Your Guardian Angel&quot; by The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus is dedicated to the eight students who lost their lives when a tornado hit the high school. The twister claimed 9 lives and destroyed Enterprise High School. The song &quot;Held In His Love&quot; by The Springs (band) was written by Stewart Halcomb, a student inside Enterprise High School on March 1, 2007, and dedicated to the eight friends he lost that day.

<text>Muscle Shoals is the largest city in Colbert County, Alabama, United States. It is located on the left bank of the Tennessee River in the northern part of the state and, as of the 2010 census, its population was 13,146. The estimated population in 2019 was 14,575.

Both the city and the Florence-Muscle Shoals Metropolitan Area (including four cities in Colbert and Lauderdale counties) are commonly called &quot;The Shoals&quot;. Northwest Alabama Regional Airport serves the Shoals region, located in the northwest section of the state in Muscle Shoals.

Due to its strategic location along the Tennessee River, Muscle Shoals had long been territory of Native American tribes. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, as Europeans entered the area in greater number, it became a center of historic land disputes. The new state of Georgia had ambitions to anchor its western claims (to the Mississippi River) by encouraging development here, but that project did not succeed.

Under President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration during the Great Depression, the Tennessee Valley Authority was established to create infrastructure and jobs, resulting in electrification of a large rural area along the river. The Ford Motor Company did build and operate a plant for many years in the Listerhill community, three miles east of Muscle Shoals; it closed in 1982 as part of industrial restructuring when jobs moved out of the country.

Since the 1960s, the city has been known for music. Local studios and artists developed the &quot;Muscle Shoals Sound&quot;, including FAME Studios in the late 1950s and Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in 1969.

==Etymology==
There are several explanations as to how the city got its name. One is that it was named after a former natural feature of the Tennessee River, a shallow zone where mussels were gathered and settlers named, and spelled, &quot;Muscle Shoals&quot;. When the area was first settled, the proper spelling of &quot;mussel&quot; to refer to the shellfish had not been locally adopted.
Cherokee people knew this place as ᏓᎫᎾᏱ (Dagunahi), or &quot;the place of clams or mussels,&quot; from &quot;daguna&quot; (mussel)&quot; and &quot;-hi&quot; (place).

==History==
Like other areas along waterways, this was important to indigenous peoples for The area of Muscle Shoals was a part of the historic Cherokee hunting grounds dating to at least the early eighteenth century, if not earlier. In the early 18th century, Muscle Shoals was the site of a French trading post. In 1783, six prominent North Carolinians (William Blount, Richard Caswell, Griffith Rutherford, John Donelson, Joseph Martin, John Sevier) formed a company for the purposes of establishing a colony at Muscle Shoals.

Many Cherokee fought against the rebels during the late American Revolutionary War, hoping to expel them from their territories. After the Revolution, Cherokee attitudes toward the new U.S. republic were divided, as settlers increasingly encroached on their territory. An anti-American faction, dubbed the Chickamauga, separated from more conciliatory Cherokees, and moved into present-day south-central and southeastern Tennessee. Most of this band settled along the Chickamauga Creek, from which their name was derived. They claimed Muscle Shoals as part of their domain. When Anglo-Americans attempted to settle the region in the 1780s and 1790s, the Chickamaugas bitterly resisted them.

The Upper Creek, residing in what is now north and central Alabama, also resented any European or Euro-American presence in the region. A major incident occurred in 1790, when U.S. President George Washington sent an expedition under Major John Doughty in an attempt to establish a fort and trading post at Muscle Shoals. This expedition was nearly annihilated by a Chickamauga and Creek party sent to destroy it, and the administration abandoned the project. Meanwhile, Francisco Luis Hector de Carondelet, governor of the Spanish Louisiana, was in conversations with the Indian confederation to establish a fort in 1792.

Anglo-American settlers in Tennessee continued to agitate for control of this region. The site was particularly desirable, as it controlled access to fine cotton-producing land immediately to its south. In 1797, John Sevier, the first governor of Tennessee, complained to Andrew Jackson that &quot;The prevention of a settlement at or near the Muscle Shoals is a manifest injury done the whole western country.&quot; At Sevier&#x27;s behest, Jackson attempted to persuade Congress and President John Adams to fund a new expedition to take control of the site, but to no avail.

U.S. officials finally took control of the region in the wake of the U.S. invasion of Creek country during the War of 1812. Jackson and General John Coffee obtained cession of the land from both the Cherokee and Creek (who had continued to dispute possession) by treaty, without permission from the federal government. Secretary of War William H. Crawford refused to recognize the cession, and reconfirmed Cherokee ownership, leading to personal enmity between him and Jackson. The political struggle over the lands was eventually won by Jackson and his backers, who gained passage in Congress of the Indian Removal Act in 1830. When Jackson, as president, implemented the policy of Indian Removal, Muscle Shoals was used as a site from which to exile the Upper Creek to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).

During World War I President Wilson authorized a dam on the Tennessee River just downstream of Muscle Shoals to help power nitrate plants for munitions.
The first plant started producing nitrates two weeks after the armistice, but the dam was not completed until 1924.

Meanwhile, in 1922 Henry Ford tried to buy the nitrate works and the unfinished dam. The Michigan car manufacturer and industrialist proposed leasing the uncompleted hydro-electric dam at Muscle Shoals on the Tennessee River in Alabama. The US War Department had begun the project during World War I, and engineers estimated a cost of $40 million to complete. At this time, public projects were financed either through raising taxes—which, Congress was unwilling to do at the time- or by issuing bonds. For the Muscle Shoals project, the proposal was for 30-year bonds at 4% interest.

Ford and his friend and fellow inventor Thomas Edison balked at the idea that the US government should have to pay $48 million in interest on top of the $40 million they would have to pay back—all for a project that would benefit the public (the argument being that the hydro-electric dam and accompanying fertilizer plants would create jobs and revitalize the area). Responding to the bond issue, Edison remarked: &quot;Any time we wish to add to the national wealth, we are compelled to add to the national debt.&quot; Edison and Ford hoped that a new monetary system could be created where dollar bills were issued directly to workers and manufacturer, with the money being backed by the goods they produced rather than the gold and silver held in bank vaults. Congress eventually rejected Ford&#x27;s idea.

The project of area development based on hydroelectric power languished until the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration created the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933 to construct needed infrastructure and install an electrical system in the rural area, using newly generated electricity from the dam complex.

==Music==
Residents in Muscle Shoals created two studios that have recorded many hit songs since the 1960s. These are FAME Studios, founded by Rick Hall, where Arthur Alexander, Percy Sledge, Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding and numerous others recorded; and Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, founded by the musicians known as The Swampers. They worked with Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Rod Stewart, the Rolling Stones, The Allman Brothers, and others.

In addition to the city being home to country music band Shenandoah, it has been a destination of numerous artists to write and record. Both FAME Studios and Muscle Shoals Sound Studio are still in operation in the city. They recorded such recent hit songs such as &quot;Before He Cheats&quot; by Carrie Underwood and &quot;I Loved Her First&quot; by Heartland, continuing the city&#x27;s musical legacy. George Michael recorded an early, unreleased version of &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; with Jerry Wexler in Muscle Shoals in 1983. Bettye LaVette recorded her Grammy nominated album &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; at FAME in 1972.

The original Muscle Shoals Sound Studios were located at 3614 Jackson Highway in Sheffield but that site was closed in 1979 when the studio relocated to 1000 Alabama Avenue in Sheffield. The studio in the Alabama Avenue building closed in 2005; it houses a movie production company, which also hosts tours and concerts at the venue.

Muscle Shoals encouraged the cross-pollination of musical styles: black artists from the area, such as Arthur Alexander and James Carr, used white country music styles in their work, and white artists from the Shoals frequently borrowed from the blues/gospel influences of their black contemporaries, creating a distinct sound.

Sam Phillips, founder of Sun Records, was born in and lived in the area. He stated that the Muscle Shoals radio station WLAY (AM), which played both &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; music, and where he worked as a disc jockey in the 1940s, influenced his merging of these sounds at Sun Records with Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor David Fricke wrote that if one wanted to play a single recording that would &quot;epitomize and encapsulate the famed Muscle Shoals Sound&quot;, that record would be &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You There&quot; by The Staple Singers in 1972. After hearing that song, American songwriter Paul Simon phoned his manager and asked him to arrange a recording session with the musicians who had performed it. Simon was surprised to learn that he would have to travel to Muscle Shoals to work with the artists. After arriving in the small town, he was introduced to the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (&quot;The Swampers&quot;) who had recorded this song with Mavis Staples. Expecting black musicians (the original Rhythm Section consisted only of white musicians), and assuming that he had been introduced to the office staff, Simon politely asked to &quot;meet the band&quot;. Once things were sorted out, Simon recorded a number of tracks with the Muscle Shoals band, including &quot;Kodachrome&quot; and &quot;Loves Me Like a Rock&quot;.

When Bob Dylan began to plan the recording of an album that would feature his new-found faith in Christ, he recruited veteran R&amp;B producer Jerry Wexler and they agreed to use the Muscle Shoals studio. Wexler remembered: &quot;Dylan came to me because he wanted the sonority he&#x27;d heard in Aretha and Otis as opposed to those out-of-time, see-you-down-the-line, thirteen-and-a-half-measure, out-of-time phrases.&quot; With Wexler, Dylan recorded two albums of contemporary gospel music, &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot; (1979) and &quot;Saved&quot; (1980).

In the early 21st century, Florence native Patterson Hood, son of &quot;Swamper&quot; David Hood, found fame as a member of the alternative rock group Drive-By Truckers. Siblings and Muscle Shoals natives Angela Hacker (winner) and Zac Hacker (second place) were the top two finishing finalists on the 2007 season of &quot;Nashville Star&quot;, a country-music singing competition. In 2008, State Line Mob, a Southern rock duo group formed by singer and songwriters Phillip Crunk (Florence native) and Dana Crunk (Rogersville native), released their first CD, &quot;Ruckus&quot;, and won two Muscle Shoals Music Awards for 2008 for (Best New Artist) and Best New Country Album) of the year. Band of Horses recorded a portion of their album &quot;Infinite Arms&quot; at Muscle Shoals. Artists signed to the FAME label in 2017 include Holli Mosley, Dylan LeBlanc, Jason Isbell, Angela Hacker, Gary Nichols, and James LeBlanc.

Although Muscle Shoals is no longer the &quot;Hit Recording Capital of the World&quot; (as it was in the 1960s and 1970s), the music continues. Groups and artists include Drive-By Truckers, The Civil Wars, Dylan LeBlanc, Gary Nichols, Jason Isbell, State Line Mob, Eric &quot;Red Mouth&quot; Gebhardt, Fiddleworms, and BoomBox.

A number of rock, R&amp;B and country music celebrities have homes in the area surrounding Muscle Shoals (Tuscumbia), or riverside estates along the Tennessee River. They may be seen performing in area nightclubs, typically rehearsing new material.
Sister city Florence, Alabama, is frequently referred to as &quot;the birthplace of the Blues&quot;. W. C. Handy was born in Florence and is generally regarded as the &quot;Father of the Blues&quot;. Every year since 1982, the W. C. Handy Music Festival is held in the Florence/Sheffield/Muscle Shoals area, featuring blues, jazz, country, gospel, rock music and R&amp;B. The roster of jazz musicians known as the &quot;Festival All-Stars&quot;, or as the
W. C. Handy Jazz All-Stars, includes musicians from all over the United States, such as guitarist Mundell Lowe, drummer Bill Goodwin, pianist/vocalist Johnny O&#x27;Neal, vibraphone player Chuck Redd, pianist/vocalist Ray Reach, and flutist Holly Hofmann.

On January 6, 2010, Muscle Shoals was added to the Mississippi Blues Trail.

After FAME studio founder Rick Hall died in early 2018, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; concluded its retrospective with this comment: 
&quot;Muscle Shoals remains remarkable not just for the music made there but for its unlikeliness as an epicenter of anything; that a tiny town in a quiet corner of Alabama became a hotbed of progressive, integrated rhythm and blues still feels inexplicable. Whatever Hall conjured there—whatever he dreamt, and made real—is essential to any recounting of American ingenuity. It is a testament to a certain kind of hope.&quot; &quot;Al.com&quot; commented that Hall is survived by his family &quot;and a Muscle Shoals music legacy like no other&quot;. An editorial in the &quot;Anniston Star&quot; concludes with this epitaph, &quot;If the world wants to know about Alabama – a state seldom publicized for anything but college football and embarrassing politics – the late Rick Hall and his legacy are worthy models to uphold&quot;.

=== 3614 Jackson Highway Studio===

The original location of Muscle Shoals Sound Studios in Sheffield has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since June 2006. From the early 2000s to 2013, it had been partly restored and open for tours. In 2013, the documentary &quot;Muscle Shoals&quot; raised public interest in a major restoration of the original studio. In the same year, the Muscle Shoals Music Foundation was formed to raise funds to purchase the building and to complete major renovations. In June 2013, the owner of the property since 1999 sold it without the historic recording equipment to the Foundation.

A grant from Beats Electronics, a manufacturer of headphones owned by Apple Inc., and founded by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, provided an essential $1 million. The state tourism director said in 2015 that the 2013 film &quot;Muscle Shoals&quot; had been a significant influence. &quot;The financial support from Beats is a direct result of their film.&quot; Additional donations were made by other groups and individuals.

, tours were visiting the partly-restored studio on Jackson Highway. It was closed when major restoration work started in September 2015. Muscle Shoals Sound Studio reopened as a finished tourist attraction on January 9, 2017. Owned and operated by the foundation, the interior is reminiscent of the 1970s, with relevant recording equipment and paraphernalia. There are plans for future recording projects.

Even before the Jackson Highway studio reopened, The Alabama Tourism Department named Muscle Shoals Sound Studio as the state&#x27;s top attraction in 2017.

===The Swampers===
The members of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section were Pete Carr (lead guitar), Jimmy Johnson (rhythm guitar), Roger Hawkins (drums), David Hood (bass guitar) and Barry Beckett (keyboards).

Affectionately called The Swampers, the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section was a local group of first-call studio musicians (initially working at FAME and then at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios) who were available for back-up. They were given the nickname The Swampers by music producer Denny Cordell during the Leon Russell sessions because of their &quot;funky, soulful Southern &#x27;swamp&#x27; sound&quot;.

A verse of the Lynyrd Skynyrd song &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; contains references to the Swampers and their native town, Muscle Shoals: &quot;Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers / And they&#x27;ve been known to pick a song or two.&quot;

<text>Tuscumbia is a city in, and the county seat of Colbert County, Alabama, United States. The population was 9,054 at the 2020 census, and was estimated to be 9,169 in 2023. The city is part of The Shoals metropolitan area.

Tuscumbia was the hometown of Helen Keller, who lived at Ivy Green. Several sites in the city are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, especially in the Tuscumbia Historic District. The city is also the site of the Alabama Music Hall of Fame.

==History==
When the Michael Dixon family arrived about 1816, they were the first European Americans to settle here. It was traditional territory of the Chickasaw people. The settlers traded with Chief Tucumseh for the Tuscumbia Valley and built their home at the head of the big spring. Other settlers joined them and there developed a village known as the Big Spring Community. The men of the community requested that the state legislature incorporate them as a city. The town was incorporated in 1820 as Ococoposa, a Chickasaw word meaning &#x27;dry watermelon&#x27;. It is one of Alabama&#x27;s oldest towns. In 1821, its name was changed to Big Spring and on December 22, 1822, to Tuscumbia, after the Chief Rainmaker of the Chickasaw.

Although shoals on the nearby Tennessee River made the river nearly impassable, a federal road completed in 1820 provided the area with good access to markets. Tuscumbia soon became the center for agriculture in northern Alabama. A line to the town on the Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad was completed in 1832, and by 1850 Tuscumbia was a major railroad hub for train traffic throughout the South.

From 1826 to the 1860s, the Tuscumbia Female Academy operated in Tuscumbia. It was one of a number of private schools founded by planters and others wealthy enough to pay for the education of their sons and daughters. A public city school system was not established until 1855.

During the Civil War, the railroad hub made Tuscumbia a target of the Union Army, which destroyed the railroad shops and other parts of the town. The Civil War resulted in the permanent closure of the Tuscumbia Female Academy.

Tuscumbia was designated as the county seat for Colbert County in 1867.

A tornado, estimated at F4 intensity on the Fujita scale, struck Tuscumbia on November 22, 1874, damaging or destroying about a third of the town and killing 14 people.

In April 1894, three African Americans accused of planning to commit arson were taken from the Tuscumbia jail by a mob of 200 men and lynched, hanged from the bridge over the Tennessee River. The turn of the century period was the nadir of race relations in the South, with frequent violence by whites against African Americans to maintain white supremacy.

==Fred the Town Dog==
In 1993, a sick and bedraggled dog wandered into Rockford. The animal was called &quot;Fred&quot; and was nursed back to health by town residents. For the next ten years, Fred was the town mascot.

Fred gained popularity through a regular newspaper column, &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Life,&quot; about his activities and encounters, and then national recognition after he was profiled on cable TV&#x27;s &quot;Animal Planet&quot;.

Fred died on December 23, 2002, in a Birmingham animal hospital, from a mysterious animal bite. He was buried behind the town&#x27;s old jailhouse. A full-size grave marker, donated by a Montgomery businessman, was added in May 2003. Fred was inducted into the Alabama Veterinary Medical Association Animal Hall of Fame in 2004.

In 2014, the story was turned into a short film documentary titled &quot;Fred: The Town Dog&quot;.

== History ==

Carolina was founded by Elzy Henderson Garvin from Wagener, South Carolina. South Carolina had been hit by an especially severe drought and when missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormons) arrived in the area, many members of the Garvin family converted to the Mormon faith. Elzy Garvin left South Carolina in search of better land, better climate for farming and for matters of faith. It was recorded that he once remarked, &quot;Our family left Ireland to practice our faith, and we are not becoming something new.&quot; The area reminded him so much of his home state that he named it &quot;Carolina&quot;. Elzy was married to Emma Catherine Bass. They produced 5 children. Sherman, Ollie, Nancy, Willia &amp; Odessa. Elzy and Emma are both buried in Carolina. Many of his relations have been found to be buried at Bethcar Baptist Church on the outskirts of Wagener, SC.

<text>Lockhart is a town in Covington County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 445.

==Geography==
Lockhart is located in southern Covington County at (31.011435, -86.350652), north of the Florida state line. Lockhart is bordered by the town of Florala to the east.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.53%, is water.

==History==
Lockhart came into being about 1904 when the Jackson Lumber Company mill was constructed there, the community being a company town. Many streets were named for Native American tribes. The mill was erected to handle the dense forests of yellow pine in what was known as the &quot;Jackson Tract&quot;. The town was named for Standard Oil magnate and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania financier, Charles Lockhart. In 1912, the mill employed around a thousand workers and ran 24/7. At that time Lockhart was the largest lumber mill in the United States. Flooring for the famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City came from Lockhart.

In 1903 the mill was the center of a peonage scandal. More than a hundred immigrant laborers recruited in cities in the North were held against their will in a walled compound on the site. Company officials were sentenced to as much as eighteen months in jail when convicted but were able to have their sentences reduced by political friends.

The milling facility was served by both the Central of Georgia Railroad and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, connecting through nearby Florala, Alabama. &quot;The mill, however, closed in 1940, and historical accounts offer two reasons. Military enlistments prior to U.S. entry in World War II caused a labor shortage, or company officials sold their holdings and the land to the residents after cutting all the timber in the area and deciding not to wait for replanted timber to mature. Jackson Lumber Company also donated much land to the state that was replanted and developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps into Geneva State Forest in neighboring Geneva County.&quot; This land had little value after it had been clear cut, the practice of the time, and being unable to sell the now-deforested acreage during the Great Depression, the company returned it to the state in the 1930s rather than pay taxes on it.
