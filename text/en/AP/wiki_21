<text>Blaine County is a county in the U.S. state of Idaho. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 24,272. The county seat and largest city is Hailey. It is also home to the Sun Valley ski resort, adjacent to Ketchum.

Blaine County was created by the territorial legislature on March 5, 1895, by combining Alturas and Logan counties; it was named for former congressman and 1884 Republican presidential nominee James G. Blaine. Its present boundaries were set on February 8, 1917, when a western portion was partitioned off to form Camas County.

Blaine County is part of the Hailey, ID Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The Wood River Valley in present-day Blaine County was organized as part of Alturas County by the Idaho Territorial Legislature in 1864. By the 1880s the valley supported a thriving mining commerce; in 1882 the county seat of Alturas County was moved from Rocky Bar in present-day Elmore County to Hailey, in response to a population shift from Rocky Bar – which would eventually become a ghost town – to the Wood River Valley.

The Blaine County boundaries described in its 1895 creation ordinance contained lands that soon were partitioned off to form other counties. Only thirteen days after the official formation date of Blaine, Lincoln County was formed from the county. Lincoln itself was later partitioned to create Gooding (1913), Minidoka (1913), and Jerome (1919) counties. Blaine County was further reduced in 1917 when Camas County was formed.

The strong mining economy of the 1880s had substantially declined by 1890, when Idaho Territory became a state. The county began to recast itself as a tourism destination in 1936 with the opening of the Sun Valley resort, originally owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. The area soon attracted celebrity visitors, and later residents, most notably Ernest Hemingway, who is buried in the Ketchum Cemetery. Celebrities who have lived in Blaine County include Adam West, Demi Moore, and John Kerry.

==County profile==
Most Blaine County residents live in the Wood River Valley along State Highway 75 in the western half of the county. This area includes all of the county&#x27;s incorporated cities and towns except Carey, which is located in the south-central part of the county at the junction of US 20 with US 26/93. The county&#x27;s gerrymandered southeastern panhandle, known locally as the Yale area, is sparsely populated.

As the home of a major ski resort, Blaine County has a higher cost of living than surrounding areas; the median value of its owner-occupied housing units is more than double the state average. As a result, many who work in Blaine County live in outlying areas, particularly in the city of Shoshone in neighboring Lincoln County. It is estimated that 2,540 people from outside the county commute to work in Blaine County.

A portion of Blaine County, the &quot;Yale&quot; area, forms a political peninsula. Douglas S. Jones of the Mini-Cassia News Service wrote that access to a Union Pacific railroad line, and therefore getting tax money from it, is likely why the county wanted that strip of land.

==Government and politics==
Since 1992, Blaine County has gained a reputation as a Democratic Party enclave in strongly Republican Idaho. The Democratic presidential candidate has won the county in every election since; that year, incumbent George H. W. Bush finished third behind Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. In 2000 and 2004, Blaine was the only Idaho county carried by Al Gore and John Kerry, respectively. Barack Obama carried the county in 2008 by a 33.2% margin over John McCain, while McCain won statewide by a 25.3% margin. It was one of three counties (Latah, Teton) in Idaho won by Obama in 2008, and by far the highest margin. In 2020, Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump in the county by 36.8 percentage points, with his 67.1% vote share being the highest for any Democrat since 1900.

Obama also carried Blaine County in 2012 with 58.8 percent of the vote, compared to Mitt Romney&#x27;s 38.7 percent. Blaine County was the only Idaho county in which Obama received over 50 percent of the vote, although he also carried Latah County with 49.6 percent of the vote. From 1968 through 1988, a less populated Blaine County was won by the Republican candidate in all six presidential elections, as was the state of Idaho, although even then the county voted more Democratic than Idaho as a whole in every election going back to 1924.

Similar to other Idaho counties, an elected three-member county commission heads the county government. Other elected officials include clerk, treasurer, sheriff, assessor, and prosecutor.

In 2006, Blaine County voted 66.3% against HJR 2, which amended the Idaho Constitution to outlaw same-sex marriage in Idaho; the measure passed with 63.4% of the statewide vote. Latah County (Moscow, home of the University of Idaho) was the only other county where the measure failed.

Until the 2021 redistricting cycle, Blaine County at the state level was located in Legislative District 25, with an all-Democratic delegation in the Idaho Legislature. Michelle Stennett, a former minority leader of the Idaho Senate, and Wendy Jaquet, a member of the Idaho House of Representatives and a former minority leader of that body, both live in Ketchum.

==Government and politics==
The last Democratic candidate for President to win the county was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Subsequent Republican victories have been by smaller margins than those in the rest of Eastern Idaho, due to the presence of Idaho State University.












Similar to other Idaho counties, an elected three-member county commission heads the county government. Other elected officials include clerk, treasurer, sheriff, assessor, coroner, and prosecutor.

Like the rest of eastern Idaho, Bannock County has a significant Latter Day Saint population which tends to strongly vote Republican. However, a substantial trade union presence in the county - as well as the Idaho State University community - often gives Democrats an overall advantage, especially in local races. Bannock County routinely elects more Democrats than Republicans to county-level offices.

At the state level, Bannock County is located in Legislative Districts 28 and 29. Democrats currently control two of these six seats in the Idaho Legislature. In 2016, Republicans were able to win House Seat A in District 29.

Idaho Department of Correction operates the Pocatello Women&#x27;s Correctional Center (PWCC) in Pocatello and in Bannock County.

==Government and politics==
Ada County has traditionally been rather conservative for an urban county. Like Idaho as a whole, it has long been a Republican Party stronghold. The last victory in a presidential election by a Democrat in Ada County was by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. It rejected Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 during his 44-state landslide. Barry Goldwater carried it by 13 points, a major reason why Idaho was Johnson&#x27;s closest state. In 2008 the presidential election in Ada County was more competitive than in previous years; John McCain defeated Barack Obama by six percentage points. Obama became the first Democrat to garner as much as 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote since Lyndon B. Johnson. In 2016, Donald Trump won the county by only a plurality due to high third party performance. In 2020, whereas the state of Idaho voted very strongly for Trump, he carried Ada County by a slim majority, only beating Joe Biden by around 3 percentage points. The election was close due to Biden&#x27;s strength in Boise&#x27;s downtown urban core, which gave him 59.2% of the vote to Trump&#x27;s 37.4%. This is the narrowest election in decades for Ada County, and the closest a Democrat has come to carrying the county since 1940. Yet, in 2024, this trend reversed, with Trump once again taking the majority in the county with 53.76% of the vote. This was the best performance for a Republican presidential candidate in Ada county since George W. Bush in 2004.

Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jerry Brady carried the county in his 2002 and 2006 races, despite losing statewide in both contests. Another prominent Democrat, Boise mayor David Bieter, was elected in 2007, 2011 and 2015.

Ada County is split between the first and second congressional districts; it is the only county in the state that is not located entirely within one district. As of 2022, the first district is represented by Russ Fulcher and includes Meridian, Eagle and Kuna, while the second district is represented by Mike Simpson and includes most of Boise proper. Both Fulcher and Simpson are Republicans.

In the Idaho Legislature, Ada County is split among nine districts, the most of any county. Each district elects one state senator and two state representatives. As of 2022, In the state senate, Republicans hold five seats and Democrats hold four. In the state house, Republicans hold ten seats and Democrats hold eight. Generally, Democratic strength is concentrated in Boise itself, while Republican strength is concentrated in the western suburbs. Several of the Boise seats were Democratic pickups in 2006.

Each party held all of their respective legislative seats in the 2008 elections, but Republicans won two competitive county commission races.

<text>Haumia-tiketike (or simply Haumia) is the god of all uncultivated vegetative food in Māori mythology. He is particularly associated with the starchy rhizome of the &quot;Pteridium esculentum&quot;, which became a major element of the Māori diet in former times. He contrasts with Rongo, the god of and all cultivated food plants.

In different tribal and regional variations of the stories involving him, he is often portrayed as the son or grandson of Ranginui. He is frequently associated with traditions of the world&#x27;s creation, in which he agreed to and attempted the separation of Rangi from his wife Papa.

== creation myth==
After Haumia agreed to Rangi and Papa&#x27;s forced separation in order to allow light and space into the world between them, he was the third child to attempt to push them apart with his arms. Despite Tāne being the one to successfully carry out the task, Haumia&#x27;s involvement meant he was subjected to the fury of their brother, Tāwhirimātea, god of the winds and storms, who would have killed him if their mother had not hidden him and their brother Rongo-mā-Tāne under her bosom - that is, in the ground.

While they had successfully escaped Tāwhirimātea&#x27;s stormy wrath, they were later discovered by Tūmatauenga (god of war, here representing humankind) who felt betrayed that he was left to fend against Tāwhirimātea by himself, so when he saw Rongo-mā-Tāne&#x27;s and Haumia-tiketike&#x27;s hair and descendants (all represented by leaves) sticking up out of the earth he harvested them with a wooden hoe and devoured them in revenge.

== Genealogy ==

== God of uncultivated food plants ==
=== Bracken ===

Food-quality rhizomes () were only obtained from the &quot;Pteridium esculentum&quot; bracken () growing in deep, moderately fertile soils. Bracken became abundant after the arrival of Māori, &quot;mainly a result of burning to create open landscapes for access and ease of travel&quot;. Rhizomes were dug in early summer and then dried for use in the winter. Although it was not liked as much as , it was appreciated for its ready availability and the ease with which it could be stored.

The rhizomes were air-dried so that they could be stored and become lighter. When ready for consumption, they were briefly heated and then softened with a (rhizome pounder); the starch could then be sucked from the fibres, or collected to be prepared for a larger feast. Several distinct styles of were developed.

The plants of the bracken genus (&quot;Pteridium&quot;) contain the known carcinogen ptaquiloside, identified to be responsible for haemorrhagic disease, as well as esophageal cancer, and gastric cancer in humans.

=== Other plants ===
A handful of other native plants from across New Zealand that are recorded as traditionally being used for food by Māori include:
* &quot;Cordyline australis&quot; - , the shoots and roots could be cooked and eaten, or used to make a sweet beverage.
* &quot;Coriaria arborea&quot; - , the juices were extracted from the berries and petals, and could be used to sweeten fernroot, or boiled with seaweed to make a black jelly.
* &quot;Cyathodes juniperina&quot; - , edible berries.
* &quot;Dacrycarpus dacrydioides&quot; - , edible berries, and could apparently be used to make beer.
* &quot;Dacrydium cupressinum&quot; - , edible berries.
* &quot;Gaultheria antipoda&quot; - , edible berries.
* &quot;Leucopogon fasciculatus&quot; - , edible berries.
* &quot;Lobelia angulata&quot; - , the leaves were cooked and eaten as greens.
* &quot;Metrosideros excelsa&quot; - , a thin layer of honey was collected from the flowers.
* &quot;Muehlenbeckia australis&quot; - , edible berries.

<text>In the mythology of Tonga, Havea Hikuleo is the goddess of the world, Pulotu. The islands of Kao, Tofua, Hunga Haapai, Hunga Tonga, Late and Fonualei came from stones thrown down from the skies by Hikuleo. They are all volcanic islands. The other, (coral) islands were fished up by her brother or cousin Maui.

==Mythology==
Hikuleʻo&#x27;s ancestors were, according to one source, the god Pil&#x27;e (Limu according to others) and the goddess Kele, who came from Pulotu and created the mythical land of Tongamamaʻo for their children to dwell in. They had a son Toiukamea &quot;Hidden Iron&quot; and a daughter Māʻimoaʻalōngona &quot;Royal Game of Hearing&quot; who married each other and had children. This pair seems to be a modern invention, since &quot;ukamea&quot; &quot;iron&quot; is a word that postdates European contact; other informants leave out this generation.

Among their children were many sons, the boy Taufulifonua and the girl Havea Lolofonua. One day they lay on the beach, naked, as they were still innocent, with their legs in the sea. The tide rose and the water covered them more and more. Then an oʻo (&quot;penetrate&quot;) fish swam along and started to suck from the girl&#x27;s labia, which caused her a lot of joy. Once the fish had been chased away the boy tried to gently stroke her inflicted parts but that did not give her relief. Then instead of his hand, he tried it with his penis, and suddenly the girl was consoled. So copulation was invented, and Havea Hikuleʻo was the first of many children.

Meanwhile, Taufulifonua and Havea Lolofonua&#x27;s younger brother and sister, also twins, also married each other. They were named Fonuʻuta &quot;Land Turtle&quot; and Fonutahi &quot;Sea Turtle&quot; and their child was Maui (Maui Motuʻa, that is; if he was not the child of Taufulifonua and Havea Lolofonua themselves). And the next younger brother and sister, also twins who married each other, were Velesiʻi &quot;Small Enticer&quot; and Velelahi &quot;Big Enticer&quot;, who brought forth Tangaloa (Tangaloa ʻEiki, that is).

When Taufulifonua had become old and close to death, he divided the universe: Tangaloa got the sky to rule, Maui the earth, and Havea Hikuleʻo became the lord of Pulotu.

Tangaloa&#x27;s descendants would become later the (divine) Tuʻi Tonga starting with ʻAhoʻeitu. Maui&#x27;s line became the Tuʻi Talau, while Hikuleʻo&#x27;s offspring was Loʻau, and the ancestry of the Tuʻi Haʻatakalaua.

The historical interpretation of this triumvirate (Hikuleʻo, Maui, Tangaloa) may be a struggle to liberate Tonga from the dominance of the Tuʻi Pulotu empire in Fiji, after which the victors could divide the spoils. Or theoretically they could have been Samoans, which made would have made Tonga and Fiji part of the so-called Tuʻi Manuʻa empire. But without credible evidence or claim, it is still a mystery whether Tu&#x27;i Manu&#x27;a even existed or had power over the isles of Tonga, Fiji or any other.

==Notes==

However, u&#x27;amea in Samoan is also an archaic word for a type of lava (known in Hawai&#x27;i as ʻaʻā), from u&#x27;a (&quot;viscous, glutinous&quot;) and mea (&quot;red-brown,&quot; as in the color of the manumea, the &quot;reddish-brown bird&quot;). U&#x27;a was used in colonial times to refer to iron because it turns the same color (&quot;mea&quot;) as it oxidizes.

<text>Tiki culture is an American-originated art, music, and entertainment movement inspired by Polynesian, Melanesian, and Micronesian cultures, and by Oceanian art. Influential cultures to Tiki culture include Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia, the Caribbean Islands, and Hawaii. The name comes from Tiki, the Māori name for the first human, often represented in the form of hei-tiki, a pendant and important taonga. The hei-tiki was often appropriated by Europeans as a commercialised good luck charm, hence the name of Tiki culture. Despite spanning over 10,000 miles and including many different unrelated cultures, religions, and languages, Tiki aesthetic is considered by some to be amalgamated into one &quot;fantasia of trans-Pacific cultures&quot; and &quot;colonial nostalgia&quot;. Because of this, and the simplistic view of the Pacific taken by the aesthetic, Tiki culture has often proved controversial.

Tiki culture initially extended to decorate themed bars and restaurants, catering to Americans&#x27; views of the South Pacific. Featuring Tiki carvings and complex, alluringly named alcoholic drinks, it eventually influenced residential recreation. It became one of the primary ways, although indirectly, that New Zealand culture influenced that of the United States. Beginning in California in the 1930s and then spreading around the world, Tiki culture was inspired by the sentimental appeal of an idealized South Pacific, particularly Polynesia, as viewed through the experiences of tourists and Hollywood movies, incorporating beautiful scenery, forbidden love, and the potential for danger. Over time, it selectively incorporated more cultural elements (and imagined aspects) of other regions such as Southeast Asia. While the decor and ambiance at these establishments largely draws from Polynesian influences, the cocktails are inspired by the tropical drinks and ingredients of the Caribbean.

Tiki culture changed over time, influenced by World War II and the firsthand exposure hundreds of thousands of American servicemen gained during that conflict. In time its appeal wore off, and both the culture and the hospitality industry theme saw a decline. The early decades of the 21st century have seen a renaissance of interest in Tiki culture, including a limited commercial revival. In addition, it has attracted people interested in cocktails, history, urban archeology, and retroism. However, the appropriation of indigenous Pacific cultures has become increasingly challenged as culturally insensitive or racist.

==Name==

Tiki is the first human in Māori mythology, and also a wooden image of him.

The word &quot;tiki&quot; was used to describe the style of the tropical islands of the South Pacific starting in the late 1930s, a usage that is &quot;unknown to the languages of the Pacific.&quot; It was applied early on to &quot;tiki punch,&quot; &quot;tiki rooms,&quot; &quot;tiki torches,&quot; and so on. By the 1950s, restaurants often used the word to describe Polynesian-themed &quot;tiki bars&quot; and &quot;tiki rooms.&quot;

The term &quot;tiki culture&quot; emerged in the 1990s to describe the revival of the style.

==Origin==

Tiki culture began at the end of Prohibition in 1933 with the opening of Don&#x27;s Beachcomber, a Polynesian-themed bar and restaurant in Hollywood, California. The proprietor was Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gantt, a young man from Texas and New Orleans who had done some rum-running with his father and claimed to have sailed throughout much of the Pacific Ocean. The restaurant&#x27;s name was later changed to Don the Beachcomber, and Beaumont-Gantt legally changed his name to Donn Beach. His restaurant featured Cantonese cuisine and exotic rum cocktails and punch drinks, with a décor of flaming torches, rattan furniture, flower leis, and brightly colored fabrics that looked like imagery out of the popular movies that were helping to fuel the desires of the average American to travel the Pacific.

In 1936, a restaurant owner from Oakland, California, Victor Bergeron, ate at the Don the Beachcomber restaurant. Bergeron said: &quot;We went to a place called the South Seas...and even visited Don the Beachcomber in Hollywood. In fact, I even bought some stuff from Don the Beachcomber. When I got back to Oakland I told my wife what I had seen, we agreed to change the name of our restaurant and our décor.&quot; The renamed restaurant, as well as his new nickname, became Trader Vic&#x27;s. Bergeron adopted the new persona in a manner to imitate Beach&#x27;s theatrics and further perpetuate the illusions of Hollywood, telling people that the leg he had lost to tuberculosis had been the result of being attacked by a shark.

Other restaurants such as Clifton&#x27;s Cafeteria also had begun introducing grand decorations based on non-traditional and &quot;kitschy&quot; themes. Clifton&#x27;s was heavily remodeled in 1939 to become Clifton&#x27;s South Seas. The exterior and interior were decorated with 12 waterfalls, volcanic rock, and tropical foliage. It supposedly even featured a &quot;sherbet-gushing volcano&quot;.

The décor of both the inside and the outside of the restaurants was often painstakingly created with decorations from around the world. Joseph Stephen Crane, the owner of the later The Luau restaurant, began his menu with a list of the places of origin of his building materials. It included not just Hawaii but virtually all areas of Oceania, as well as furniture from Hong Kong and &quot;man eating clam shells&quot; from the Indian Ocean.

Early tiki restaurants, although not called that at the time, attempted to walk a fine line between the reality and myth of what they were creating, acknowledging that much of it was Hollywood hocus-pocus but also trying to create an atmosphere of authenticity. Crane&#x27;s later restaurant menus stated: &quot;You have just passed the gangplank into another world – into a segment of Paradise – or such is the illusion we of THE LUAU hope to create. And truly it is more than an illusion for there is authenticity in the adventure you are about to experience... Both food and drink are prepared under the matchless guidance of the one and only Dr. Foo Fong... Our drink specialties, Island Symphonies of rare and distinguished rums, irresistibly claim your fullest respect which is best shown by drinking slowly and reverently&quot;.

South Seas genre movies leading up to this period included &quot;White Shadows in the South Seas&quot; (1928), &quot;The Love Trader&quot; (1928), and &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; (1932). Beach frequently interacted with movie stars, inviting them to his home for luau-like dinners and becoming friends with actors such as Clark Gable.

&quot;Hei Tiki&quot; was released in 1935, with a &quot;New York Times&quot; review describing the plot as being about &quot;a chieftain&#x27;s daughter who is declared tabu and destined to be the bride of the war god&quot;. It attributed the title to mean &quot;love charm&quot;, in reference to Hei-tiki pendants sometimes associated with fertility. &quot;Waikiki Wedding&quot;, starring Bing Crosby and Martha Raye, was released in 1937 with the popular song &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;, as was &quot;Her Jungle Love&quot; in 1938, starring Dorothy Lamour.
During a time when overseas civilian China Clipper air travel was still uncommon, the Hawaiian Steamship Company&#x27;s Matson Line also continued its aggressive advertising campaigns promoting a leisurely but still exotic island lifestyle, led by famous photographers such as Edward Steichen and Anton Bruehl and featuring actresses such as Jinx Falkenburg (later in &quot;Sweetheart of the Fleet&quot; and &quot;Tahiti Nights&quot;). Matson commissioned artists to design memorable keepsake menus for the voyages.

Between the Matson Line&#x27;s advertising, new restaurants and continual cinematic exposure, the theme began to take on a life of its own. California&#x27;s World&#x27;s Fair in 1939 – the Golden Gate International Exposition – celebrated for the first time Polynesian culture in the United States. The feature of the fair was &quot;Pageant of the Pacific&quot;, primarily showcasing the goods of nations bordering the Pacific Ocean. At its opening ceremonies President Franklin Roosevelt spoke of friendship and the co-mingled destinies between the United States and Pacific countries, a sentiment physically symbolized in part with the incorporation of a giant, 80-foot statue of Pacifica, goddess of the Pacific Ocean. World War II would greatly test those ambitions.

==Post-World War II==
When American servicemen returned home after the end of World War II in 1945, they brought with them stories and souvenirs from their time in the South Pacific that helped to reinforce the popularity of what Hollywood had set the stage for Donn Beach to create. Beach was himself a WWII veteran, and he had invented the Three Dots &amp; A Dash cocktail, which is Morse code for &quot;V&quot; (for victory). Women wore &quot;victory roll&quot; hairstyles and people were in the mood to celebrate.

The excitement surrounding Thor Heyerdahl&#x27;s 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition, followed by the book in 1948 and a movie in 1950, helped promote tropical exploration. Importantly within the context of tiki culture, it successfully injected the word &quot;tiki&quot; into the popular American lexicon on a large scale (Hawaiians had not used the word &quot;tiki&quot;, but rather &quot;ki‘i&quot;). Heyerdahl&#x27;s work also expanded the theme&#x27;s mythology to include the west coast of South America in what became an ever increasing mix of cultural motifs, both real and imagined. Easter Island statues (moai) also became iconic with the publication of his book Aku-Aku.

Steven Crane of The Luau restaurant took advantage of the public&#x27;s fascination with Heyerdahl and further followed in the footsteps of Beach and Bergeron by building a chain of tiki restaurants in partnership with Sheraton Hotels called Kon-Tiki Ports. Crane is generally credited with also bringing tiki to the forefront of decorations at such restaurants and bars, prominently placing their image on his menu covers, matchbooks, entry ways, and other signage. Southern Pacific themes continued to stray more into the even further imagined realm of the mysterious &quot;tiki&quot;.
James Michener won the 1948 Pulitzer Prize for his collection of short stories, &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot;, which in turn was the basis for &quot;South Pacific&quot;, the 1949 musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein that included the song &quot;Bali Ha&#x27;i&quot; about a mystical tropical island. The Bali Hai restaurant opened a few years later on San Diego&#x27;s Shelter Island, introducing its faux-tiki mascot and signature cocktail, the Mr. Bali Hai.

In addition to the returning World War II veterans, several other factors contributed to the mid-century American explosion in tiki culture. Post-war America saw the rise of the middle class as an economic force. This coupled with ever-increasing affordability of travel, particularly newly established civilian air travel to Hawaii (which had been halted during the war), helped to propel the nation&#x27;s disposable income into all things tropical. Just as the Matson Line had done with their boats, the airlines aggressively marketed flights to consumers.

Donn Beach moved to Hawaii, where he later lived on a houseboat and was a driving force behind the 1956 creation of the International Market Place in Waikiki. He opened a Don the Beachcomber there, along with the Dagger Bar and created a treehouse office in the top of a giant banyan tree that oversaw a complex of multiple thatch-roofed buildings and huts that sold a variety of goods from around the tropical world. Other tiki bars opened in Hawaii as well, initially staffed by native bartenders who did not recognize the allegedly Hawaiian drinks that American tourists were requesting. Hawaiian bartender Harry Yee created the iconic Blue Hawaii cocktail in 1957. Ultimately, Beach and his ex-wife had at least 25 restaurants in the Beachcomber chain. Bergeron and his Trader Vic&#x27;s had even more, beginning with his first franchise in Seattle (the Outrigger) in 1949 and going on to have locations all over the world. Steven Crane&#x27;s franchise also expanded, and &quot;mom and pop&quot; tiki bars flourished in the 1950s well into the 1960s across the country in various forms of shapes and sizes.

Over the 1950s, Polynesian design began to infuse many aspects of the country&#x27;s visual aesthetic, from home accessories to architecture. The Trader Vic&#x27;s in Palo Alto eventually even spawned architectural choices, such as the concept behind the odd-looking Tiki Inn Motel, which still exists as the Stanford Terrace Inn. Single family homes, apartment complexes, bowling alleys and other business were heavily influenced by assumed Polynesian aesthetics, in some cases incorporating the motif into entire residential areas and shopping districts. Much of it was accomplished by purchasing material from the company Oceanic Arts, which opened in 1956 by both importing materials and doing original wood carvings in California.

Following Hawai&#x27;i statehood in 1959, the 1960s saw a popular trend among surfers, especially in California, of wearing tiki god necklaces, adopting tiki &#x27;mascots&#x27; to protect their surfing spots, and wearing Hawaiian shirts. Like surfing itself, the imagery was adopted by the youth culture of the time. The surfers in Gidget Goes Hawaiian (1961) wore tiki carvings as pendants, and followed a leader known as the Big Kahuna. 

In 1963, Disneyland opened the Walt Disney&#x27;s Enchanted Tiki Room attraction, feature Polynesian-style decor, fashion, and music. In 1971, a similar attraction was opened in Walt Disney World as well as a hotel resort of the same theme.

==Drinks==
===Elaborate cocktails===
If Tiki culture began as a restaurant theme made to look like a Hollywood set, alcoholic drinks dressed up in elaborate barware are its cornerstones and main actors. Just as the Don the Beachcomber restaurant is largely credited as being the first &quot;tiki bar&quot; from which all other such establishments &quot;liberally borrowed&quot;, Beach himself is also credited as having almost single-handedly created the entire &quot;tiki drink&quot; genre. He was the first restaurateur to focus an entire drink menu on the mixing of flavored syrups and fresh fruit juices with rum, which he called &quot;Rhum Rhapsodies&quot; and were served in fancy glasses, hollowed out pineapples, and drilled coconuts. A social extrovert good at gaining attention, Beach&#x27;s early success was noted by tiki historian Jeff Berry, who said that &quot;Donn was good with names, good with drinks, and good with drink names&quot;.

These &quot;exotic&quot; drinks, such as his first, the Sumatra Kula, quickly made Beach&#x27;s restaurant the hot spot for the elite and movie stars from the 1940s well into the 1960s. Howard Hughes was a regular at the Hollywood Don the Beachcomber, as were Charlie Chaplin and Frank Sinatra. Over time many restaurateurs had begun to copy, and in some cases steal, Beach&#x27;s cocktail recipes and template for immersive island decorations coupled with &quot;newly discovered&quot; Southeast Asian/Polynesian food (rumaki, crab rangoon, etc.). Many eventually created their own signature drink and food dishes, but Beach remains regarded as the originator and is credited for having invented many of the most memorable drinks such as the Cobra&#x27;s Fang, Pearl Diver, Pi Yi, Shark&#x27;s Tooth, Test Pilot, and Zombie. Many drink names were meant to sound as having a foreign origin or being tongue in cheek dangerous.

Bergeron was viewed as a Beach contemporary with his founding of Trader Vic&#x27;s, and although Bergeron had started by copying the &quot;tiki template&quot; that Beach had created he eventually provided significant additions to the tiki canon. He also ultimately had longer staying power than Beach and over time created nearly as many additional cocktails. He is especially known for creating the Fog Cutter cocktail and Scorpion bowl, as well as the quintessential Mai Tai. Many were strong drinks and noted on menus as having a &quot;limit of two&quot; per person.

A protracted feud between Beach and Bergeron erupted when both claimed to have invented the Mai Tai, which Beach said was a knock-off of his Q.B. Cooler. Bergeron eventually won the exclusive rights to distribute a commercial Mai Tai mix for people to use at home.

Some drinks served at tiki bars include co-opting previous cocktails with exotic sounding names or foreign backstories, such as the Bloody Nelson, Blow My Skull, Boomerang, Corpse Reviver, Diki-Diki, Doctor Funk, Planter&#x27;s Punch, and Singapore Sling. New inventions by Beach, Bergeron, and others included the Coffee Grog, Navy Grog, Lapu Lapu, Outrigger, Pago Pago, Rum Barrel, Shrunken Head, and Tropical Itch. While many were created expressly as &quot;tiki drinks&quot; (although such a term was not used at the time), others were simply new World War II era cocktails made overseas that could quickly be assimilated into the formula, such as the case with the Suffering Bastard.

Beach was very secretive with his drink recipe ingredients, with only a select few of his bartenders knowing them. Some drinks Beach would only make himself, and he frequently placed alcohol into generic bottles labeled with only letters or numbers, or premixed &quot;secret&quot; ingredients in a similar fashion so that employees only needed to &quot;mix X, Y, &amp; Z with lime juice&quot; to make a certain drink.

Bergeron was less secretive with his ingredients over time, releasing two drink guides that carried his recipes, one in 1947 and the other in 1972. Despite this, many original cocktail recipes were lost to time, either because the recipes themselves were altered to reflect changing tastes (or restaurant budgets), or simply because memories faded and people died. The disagreement between Beach and Bergeron over who created the Mai Tai was not an isolated incident, and who &quot;invented&quot; what drink and when was frequently obscured by establishments that served cocktails with the same name but in sometimes remarkably different manners.

=== Mugs and other vessels ===
Tiki drinks, as they are generically called, are typically heavily garnished, with ample fruit, swizzle sticks, cocktail umbrellas, or flowers. Establishments that were part of or influenced by tiki culture also eventually served at least some of their cocktails in decorative ceramic mugs, which came to be known in the 1950s as tiki mugs because the barware started to bear the shape of a tiki or &quot;faux tiki&quot; approximation. Styles and sizes vary widely, and are generically referred to as tiki mugs even if they are in the shape of a skull, hula girl, or other motif. The cocktails may also be served in hollowed out pineapples, or in large communal drink bowls with long straws that are meant to be shared. Some are set on fire with overproof rum for additional theatrics and flair.

Many restaurants offer a signature drink in a tiki mug that the customer is able to take home or purchase. Both Beach and Bergeron offered in-restaurant &quot;stores&quot; where people could buy not only mugs but drink mixes and other kitsch items. Some mugs were simply stolen and brought home by diners. This led to a large number of 20th-century tiki mugs surviving as souvenirs. Vintage tiki mugs are highly prized finds and are considered to be as much of a symbol of the tiki culture as a tiki itself.

==Fashion==
The so-called burgeoning &quot;tiki culture&quot; influenced the clothing choices of mainstream Americans. This held true for both general wear and over time included how to get &quot;dressed up&quot; for going out to get a few drinks and fitting in with the exotic ambience of tiki restaurants.

Sarong inspired dresses became more popular with women, and were also associated with actresses and pin-up models used in tourism advertising such as Dorothy Lamour (known as both the &quot;Sarong Girl&quot; and the &quot;Sarong Queen&quot; from her role in the 1937 film &quot;The Hurricane&quot;). Other movies such as Abbott and Costello&#x27;s &quot;Pardon My Sarong&quot;, as well as &quot;Song of the Sarong&quot; and &quot;Sarong Girl&quot; were later released over the course of the 1940s, and served to self reinforce the popularity of Beach&#x27;s and Bergeron&#x27;s tropical escape restaurant motifs during this time.

An increasing emphasis on idealized &quot;wahine&quot; (island women) saw their depiction grow from menu cover placement to their use on tiki barware. The Fog Cutter mug and the Kava Bowl were two of the earliest ceramic tiki drinking vessels bearing the images of such women to be used in Trader Vic&#x27;s restaurants. The Pago Pago Lounge also created a Sarong cocktail.
For men, the &quot;Hawaiian Shirt&quot; would become an enduring symbol of leisure and were increasingly worn in public. US President Harry Truman was famously pictured wearing a Hawaiian shirt on the front cover of &quot;Life Magazine&#x27;s&quot; 10 December 1951 issue.

Called &quot;aloha shirts&quot; on the island, the book &quot;Aloha Attire: Hawaiian Dress in the Twentieth Century&quot; describes how the shirt&#x27;s history is more than Hawaiian and can be traced to a confluence of cultural influences. As explained by author Linda Bradley, the shirt was actually made with a Western-style silhouette originally inspired by Western sailor shirts, was cut from Japanese crepe fabric (originally used for kimono), was sewn by Japanese and Chinese tailors who immigrated to Hawaii as plantation field workers, and was ultimately worn like a Filipino barong tagalog (always untucked and outside of the pants).

Gardenia, hibiscus, and florals became a more popular fabric pattern in America, as did palm fronds and similar types of tropical plants or animals such as fish and birds. Beyond Polynesia, other more frequently worn patterns included Batik and fabrics from differing Oceanic regions. Leis became worn more frequently outside of Hawaii, not just at Tiki restaurants but also at backyard barbeques and &quot;luau&quot; pool parties.

==Hawaiian statehood==

Official Hawaiian statehood in 1959 became another factor in the popularity of the tropical lifestyle, but also changed how tiki culture was perceived. Hawaii was no longer just a foreign country to the American people, in reality or as imagined, but now a formalized part of their country. Tourism continued ever bigger growth, with the years after statehood becoming a &quot;jet rush&quot; for vacationers snapping up $100 tickets for a now only five-hour flight from Los Angeles or San Francisco without the former restrictions of the former Territory of Hawaii. With statehood making travel easier than ever, for many average Americans for the first time the myth of what Hawaii was and what it was supposed to be came face to face as a booming economy and urbanization began to change the lifestyle of its countryside.

During America&#x27;s honeymoon with the romanticized version of its newly incorporated state came the 1959 Warner Bros. Television series &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; and the 1961 musical smash-hit &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;, featuring pop crooner Elvis Presley playing an Army veteran returning to Hawaii to surf, sing, and marry his girlfriend. It contained many plot elements similar to 1937&#x27;s &quot;Waikiki Wedding&quot;, and helped to bring a &quot;Polynesian pop&quot; aspect of tiki to a new generation. This addition came as tiki culture music had begun to split into separate subgenres with the additions of lounge and exotica in the 1950s, which at that point had amended the typical Bing Crosby style of American-Hawaiian music. The popularity of Elvis nevertheless helped to keep broad tiki culture alive, even as adults began to take it into new directions and their children began to meld it into evolving subcultures such as surf.

==Music==
The impact of tiki culture on music (and vice versa) had beginnings in the creation of &quot;hapa-haole&quot; music, with &quot;haole&quot; meaning &quot;foreigner&quot; in the context, derived from America&#x27;s expectation of native Hawaiian (and other Oceanic regions) folk music. As is the case with much of tiki culture, its genres can fall into varying themes. Hapa-Haole was more prominent in Beach&#x27;s and Bergeron&#x27;s early days during the 1930s and 1940s, and was more traditional and &quot;poppish&quot;. Later genres, such as exotica and lounge are more associated with mood music meant to play-off the &quot;mysteriousness&quot; and faux-danger of tiki. It could include high energy drumming or slower and enchanting melodic rhythms. It was frequently instrumental, serving as the &quot;soundtrack&quot; for tropical excursions. Exotica and lounge were more prominent in the 1950s and later, although new variations of hapa-haole would also continue.

===Hapa-haole===
Traditional Hawaiian melodies, sometimes called &quot;Hula Music&quot; at the time by mainstream Americans, initially became prominent in piano sheet music and also created a dancing fad and obsession with Hula girls swaying to the music of strummed ukuleles.

&quot;Hapa-haole&quot; is the more proper name for what most 20th century Americans would think of as sung Hawaiian music, where the tune, styling, and subject matter have very distinct Hawaiian elements, but the lyrics are mostly in English. It became sung by both Hawaiians and contemporary performers, such as the Bing Crosby vehicles &quot;Sweet Leilani&quot; and &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; in 1937. Alfred Apaka was arguably the foremost interpreter of hapa haole music, melding Hawaiian music with traditional American pop arrangements and English lyrics. Apaka began touring in the late 1930s, and settled more into routine shows at performance rooms created just for him in Hawaii in the 1950s. He would also sing at large luaus being put on by Donn Beach.

Other important singers include Hal Aloma, who had changed his name in response to the 1926 film &quot;Aloma of the South Seas&quot;, and the legendary Don Ho would follow in the 1960s and 1970s. Music changed with the times with easy listening light instrumentation, with Ho releasing his famous song &quot;Tiny Bubbles&quot;, which charted on both the pop (#57 Billboard) and easy listening charts in 1967. Ho also helped bring attention to Marlene Sai, who has been described as a living legend of Hawaiian music.

===Exotica and lounge===

Yma Sumac first appeared on radio in 1942. Born in Peru, she was not Polynesian but she quickly became famous because of her diverse vocal range and in 1946 her home government formally supported her claim to be a descendant of Atahualpa, the last Incan emperor. With enough &quot;exotic&quot; credibility to be packaged as part of tiki culture, especially after Heyerdahl linked tiki to the Andes in 1947, she released albums with names such as &quot;Voice of the Xtabay&quot; and &quot;Legend of the Sun Virgin&quot;. These featured tiki-like South American stone carvings and exploding volcanoes on their covers. She also went on to play in minor film roles, such as &quot;Secret of the Incas&quot;. &quot;Voice of the Xtabay&quot; was produced and composed by Les Baxter, who had started to experiment with theremin mood music on &quot;Music Out of the Moon&quot; a few years earlier.

Baxter began to &quot;tikify&quot; this type of mood music. Most lounge and exotica was chiefly instrumental, and largely the integration of exotic escapism into American Jazz. Other early pioneers included Arthur Lyman and Martin Denny, who played live at Don the Beachcomber and other venues. The new theme was blended through jazz stylings augmented with Polynesian, Southeast Asian, and Latin instruments. The music also incorporated elements of Afro-Cuban rhythms, unusual instrumentations, environmental sounds, and the lush romantic themes of Hollywood.

Sandra Warner was showcased on the album cover for &quot;Exotica&quot;, helping it to reach no.1 on the Billboard charts and eventually giving the entire genre its name. She appeared on the first 12 Martin Denny album covers, 16 overall, and became a lasting iconic association with both the genre and tiki culture. Other important albums in the genre included &quot;Jewels of the Sea&quot;, &quot;Ritual of the Savage&quot;, and &quot;Forbidden Island&quot;, matched with similarly evocative covers.

There are two primary strains of this kind of exotica: &quot;jungle exotica&quot; and &quot;tiki exotica.&quot; Jungle exotica was a Hollywood creation, with its roots in Tarzan movies (and further back to William Henry Hudson&#x27;s novel &quot;Green Mansions&quot;). Les Baxter was the king of jungle exotica. Tiki exotica on the other hand was introduced in Martin Denny&#x27;s Waikiki nightclub jungle noises arrangement in Baxter&#x27;s song &quot;Quiet Village&quot;.

Robert Drasnin and Korla Pandit were other important artists in the genre. Just as Bergeron and others in tiki culture had done before him, Pandit invented a new persona (he was born John Roland Redd) by claiming to be a French-Indian musician from New Delhi when he was in fact born in the United States and would be considered by some to be African-American.

==Television==

===First Wave (1933–1980)===
The TV detective show &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; (1959–1963) prominently featured a tiki during its credits, and although shot mostly in California it helped to promote the island while spinning off tiki motific comic books and games. Harry Yee is generally attributed with inventing a Hawaiian Eye cocktail named after the show. A &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; tiki mug was made as well.

Hawaiian politician turned actor Tiki Santos (born Abraham De Los Santos) was a recurring minor role character on &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; and went on to make appearances in other shows such as the sitcom &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; (1962–1966). He played the role of Chief Watara in episodes such as &quot;The Dart Gun Wedding&quot;, sitting in a large wicker &quot;throne&quot; behind a large tiki mask.

As the first tiki wave started to crest towards the end of the 1960s, the original air of mystery and exoticism associated with the tiki motif by Americans began to be replaced by more humorous &quot;curse of the tiki&quot; plot devices as sitcoms gained prominence on television. The visual iconography of TV series &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1964–1967) borrowed significantly from an assumed tiki culture with huts and furniture resembling a fantasy-Polynesian castaway village. An episode had the cast disturbing the resting place of a vengeful tiki god, and attempting to break the curse by invoking &quot;The Great Watubi&quot;. A well-known 1972 episode of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; entitled &quot;The Tiki Caves&quot; involves a magical, taboo idol which the characters believe to be cursed.

Shows like &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, &quot;Green Acres&quot;, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, and &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; often featured special Hawaiian episodes. Tiki carvings sometimes appeared on the shows, including on &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; but in increasingly less prominent ways.

The long running &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; series hailed back to &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, and was one of a few exception to the sitcoms during this time. The crashing of its iconic wave during opening credits ended with its cancellation in 1980, coinciding with the general end of tiki culture&#x27;s first wave as well.

===Second Wave (1990s) to Present===
The &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; franchise, created in 1999 by marine biologist Stephen Hillenburg, heavily relies on Tiki art, patterns, and music. Tiki-themed elements of the show include intertitle paintings; retro Hawaiian and hula production music from APM; borrowing patterns from aloha prints and Polynesian patterns for backgrounds and skies; and character and background designs which reflect Māori religious influences, such as Squidward&#x27;s dwelling which resembles a religious Tiki head. Showrunner Stephen Hillenburg referred to Squidward&#x27;s house as an &quot;Easter Island head&quot; despite the design differences.

==Decline==
Towards the latter part of the 1970s, &quot;tiki restaurants&quot; were well past the apex of their popularity and many started to close. This was true for both many independent tiki bars as well as what had grown into the major chains associated with hotels such as Vic&#x27;s Outrigger and the Sheraton&#x27;s Kon-Tiki. The majority of independent tiki bars like the Pago Pago Lounge were demolished or shuttered, with only a few such as the Tonga Room, Tiki Ti, and Mai Kai managing to stay afloat. Trader Vic&#x27;s was the only of the former major chains that was still in large scale operation.

By 1980, most of the tiki aesthetic in architecture and elsewhere had been completely wiped away in the name of progress. Some examples of homes, apartments and restaurant buildings remained, almost exclusively on the west coast. Of those, only a small handful still featured carved tikis.

The allure of escapism and tropical drinks for the average American still remained, but was eclipsed by Jimmy Buffett and Parrotheads seeking the closer to home &quot;Margaritaville&quot; instead of tikis further away Bali-Hai islands as their preferred Shangri-La for relaxing and drinking.

Tiki restaurants and bars had been vital through much of the 1930s into the 1970s, what Jeff Berry called an unprecedented lifespan for a [themed] drink fad. The Chin Tiki, which had been permanently closed in 1980 and falling into disrepair, was finally torn down in Detroit near the turn of the century, just as tiki was beginning to stir once again on America&#x27;s west coast.

==Partial revival==
The later 1990s saw the start of a renewed larger scale interest in tiki from a variety of sources, the main being simply based on the curiosity of a new generation whose Woodstock parents had rejected tiki as old and &quot;square&quot;, but for their children was something new to be appropriated and repurposed. This began with people like Bosko Hrnjak, who had been raised in California&#x27;s San Gabriel valley among its tiki inspired architecture and who in the mid-1990s began to carve large palm logs into tikis for his home bar. He became an influential artist known for his burnt wood carving style and making of homemade tiki mugs, an early catalyst for getting tiki&#x27;s revival off the ground. Another early artist of the revival period was Tiki King from the Santa Cruz mountains. He was inspired by his artistic parents and a large tiki given to his family by his surfer uncle. He became known for carving tiki necklaces and starting a mail order tiki business in the early 1990s.

Also towards the end of the century saw a renewed interest in trying to &quot;authentically&quot; recreate older drinks. Jeff &quot;Beachbum&quot; Berry released several drink books starting in 1998 (the &quot;Grog Log&quot;, &quot;Intoxica&quot;, and others) that contained researched recipes for many of the signature drinks from the sometimes shuttered bars of previous decades. This was also the beginnings of the &quot;urban archeology&quot; aspects of 21st century tiki culture, based on historical interest and fueled by the &quot;puzzle solving&quot; of trying to discover secrets from the past from a cultural theme that was based in part on the &quot;exploration&quot; of tropical regions. Berry&#x27;s work is considered to be one of the most important contributions to tiki&#x27;s renaissance.

Soon after also came the influential &quot;The Book of Tiki&quot; by Sven Kirsten in 2000. Before that, Otto Von Stroheim had been self publishing a &#x27;zine called &quot;Tiki News&quot; that helped provide critical mass for books like Kirsten&#x27;s to be made. Berry created two cocktails named after both Kirsten and Stroheim for their early contributions to tiki&#x27;s resurgence in his historical drink guides.

In 1995 tiki websites began to grow on the internet; in 1995 Exoticon, a convention of tiki art and exotic music, drew over 1500 people in Los Angeles including local celebrities such as Mark Mothersbaugh and Matt Groening.

===Restaurant and bar resurgence===

Many new tiki bars and retro-Polynesian themed restaurants began to open their doors after the turn of the century. Non-themed bars also started placing tiki drinks on their menus, signaling a broader acceptance of the genre while also engendering discussion over what qualified to be called an &quot;authentic&quot; tiki bar.

Interest in tiki had also proliferated overseas, with &quot;The Book of Tiki&#x27;s&quot; Sven Kirsten hailing from Germany where a tiki subculture is strong. In 2017 noted tiki historians Sven Kirsten, Jeff Berry, Martin Cate, Brian Miller, and Chris Osburn listed their top 15 operating tiki bars in the world, which included four from London, one from Munich, one from Tokyo, and one from Barcelona.

===Lowbrow movement===
In California and elsewhere, the re-exploration of rat rod and Hot rod culture melded with tiki, tattoo history, and rockabilly music to create new cultural hybrids such as &quot;lowbrow&quot; that manifested itself in music, art, and a new breed of tiki bars. Rockabilly artist Brian Setzer released his album &quot;The Dirty Boogie&quot; in 1998, featuring retro tiki bar images on its cover. &quot;Taboo: The Art of Tiki&quot; was released in 1999, with artists such as Mark Ryden and Shag also employing tiki imagery in retro eclectic paintings.

WFMU&#x27;s on-line channel &quot;Sheena&#x27;s Jungle Room&quot; plays exotica music as part of its mix of &quot;all things Lowbrow&quot;.

Psycho Suzi&#x27;s Motor Lounge opened featuring motifs of tattooed hula girls sporting suicide rolls and a parking lot accommodated for motorcycles. It describes itself by saying: &quot;We take lovingly-remembered tiki bar history, a healthy helping of tattoo culture, several measures of kitsch, a dash of voodoo and a passion for good times, stick them all in a blender and hit Liquify&quot;. The bar had originally opened in 2003 at a shuttered A&amp;W Drive-In.

The popularity of modern Western tattooing already had its roots in the South Pacific, but a resurgence in tattooing saw popularity with tiki-related tattoos. Sailor Jerry Rum, named after legendary tattoo artist Norman Collins, was introduced and marketed in part to be used in tiki drinks.

&quot;Tiki Art Now!: A Volcanic Eruption of Art&quot; was published in 2004 with an introduction by Otto Von Stroheim. Art galleries held Tiki Art shows, highlighting the works of artists such as Sunny Buick, Heather Watts, Derek Yaniger, Flounder, and Tiki Tony.

Lowbrow also spawned &quot;Tiki Noir&quot;, a literary subgenre of hard-boiled crime fiction in a tiki setting, in which the main character is often a world-weary and deeply flawed detective. &quot;Ritual of the Savage&quot; by Jay Strongman and the comic &quot;Hawaiian Dick&quot; are two examples.

=== 21st-century cultural events ===
The rise in popularity for traditional tiki drinks also took hold in the craft cocktail movement, as well as within certain &quot;retro culture&quot; circles that were associated with it such as with Hipsters. Switching tiki drinks back to their original fresh juice origins, which had turned towards more artificial syrups during tiki&#x27;s decline, helped to give the drinks a new reputation. The craft cocktail movement also saw drink experimentation that moved beyond rum and gin, highlighting tiki cocktails that were made with American whiskey and other different base liquor ingredients.

Duke Carter&#x27;s catalogue of historical tiki mugs, &quot;Tiki Quest&quot;, was published in 2003. Goodwill stores and thrift shops saw dusty tiki mugs suddenly whisked off their shelves, becoming stock for new home tiki bars and period-authentic sets for &quot;Blast from the Past&quot; and &quot;Mad Men&quot;. These bars range from the simple to full-builds which rival their commercial forebears. Modern tiki mug manufacturing in the 21st century also became common and they are frequently purchased on the internet from companies such as Tiki Farm and Munktiki, among others.

The pioneering video podcast &quot;Tiki Bar TV&quot; started in 2005, highlighting drink recipes such as the Suffering Bastard and the Boomerang while filling tongue in cheek &quot;prescriptions&quot; for modern day maladies with tiki cocktails. It garnered attention from the Apple Corporation.

&quot;Tiki Magazine&quot; was launched, and large tiki-themed conventions began being held. Annual events include Tiki Oasis in San Diego started in 2001 by Otto and Baby Doe von Stroheim; the Hukilau occurs in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and was started in 2002 by Tim &quot;Swanky&quot; Glazner and Christie White in association with the Mai-Kai restaurant. In 2005, Robert Drasnin was invited to perform at The Hukilau, his show consisting of selections from his 1959 album &quot;Voodoo&quot;, as well as new material that would form the basis for the release of &quot;Voodoo II&quot; almost a half century later in 2007.; Tiki-Kon started as the NW Tiki Crawl in 2003, and takes place in Portland, Oregon. &quot;Tiki Caliente&quot; in Palm Springs. The Ohana: Luau at the Lake takes place in Lake George, NY at the Tiki Resort hotel. It is put on in conjunction with The Fraternal Order of Moai, a tiki-themed social club formed in Ohio in 2005. Inhuele is hosted in Atlanta, GA every January. The same organizers also produce an Atlanta tiki home-bar crawl.

A remake of Thor Heyerdahl&#x27;s 1950 documentary was filmed using two languages and turned into a major motion picture in 2012 with the release of &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot;. The documentary &quot;Bosko and the Rebirth of Tiki&quot; was released in 2018.

== Critical reception ==
With the 21st century revival has come criticism. Some criticize tiki bars as a seductive form of cultural appropriation which can obscure and subsume native traditions and divert attention from the history of violent colonialism in the region. In 2016, National Public Radio posed the question: &quot;Let&#x27;s talk tiki bars, harmless fun or exploitation?&quot;

<text>In Fijian mythology, Dakuwaqa (Dakuwanga) is a shark deity and often appears as a fierce sea monster, guarding the islands. He was greatly respected by fishermen because he protected them from any danger at sea and its denizens.

==Background==
In one creation myth, the god was planning inland to conquer Kadavu Island through the river when a goddess challenged him in the form of an octopus. After a great battle, the octopus won by pulling out his teeth with her eight arms which enabled her to hold off the massive attack of Dakuwaqa, forcing Dakuwaqa to promise to never attack Kadavu again. That is how Dakuwaqa became the god and protector of Kadavu. 

Dakuwaqa can also change shape into anything, but his real form is that of a muscular Fijian man with the upper torso of a shark. In the book &quot;Pacific Irishman&quot;, the Anglican priest Charles William Whonsbon-Aston records in Chapter 1, &quot;Creation&quot;:

== Media ==

* Jeff VanderMeer wrote the story &quot;The Third Bear&quot; about Dakuwaqa. 
* Dakuwaqa is the father of the supervillain King Shark in the DC Universe. 
* One episode of the History Channel series &quot;Beast Legends&quot; is about Dakuwaqa.
* Dakuwanga is an Atlantean Bio-weapon in the Earth Prime setting of the Mutants &amp; Masterminds roleplaying game. 
* Dakuwanga is the official pet in the &quot;Quidditch World Cup Argentina 2014&quot; in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe. 
* Dakuwaqa&#x27;s vest is a fictional artifact mentioned in the 2017 film &quot;Sharknado 5: Global Swarming&quot; as the item used to prevent sharknados in the past. 
* The merged tribe in &quot;Survivor 45&quot; was named after Dakuwaqa.

<text>In Māori and Polynesian mythology, Ikatere, also spelled Ika-tere, (&#x27;fast fish&#x27;) is a fish god, the father of all sea creatures, including mermaids.

He is a son of Punga, and a grandson of Tangaroa, and his brother is Tū-te-wehiwehi (Grey 1971:1–5).

==Disagreements between brothers==
When Tāwhirimātea (god of storms) made war against his brothers for the separation of Rangi and Papa (sky and earth), Ikatere and Tū-te-wehiwehi were among those who had to flee from his wrath for their survival. The two argued over whether they should stay in the sea or go to the land. Ikatere chose to keep his children, the fish, to the sea, while Tū-te-wehiwehi chose to take his children, reptiles, to the land. A saying that refers to the choices they made for their descendants goes as such:

<text>Kaha&#x27;i (specifically: Hawaii; elsewhere Tafaki, Tafa&#x27;i, Tahaki, Tava&#x27;i, Tāwhaki) is a handsome Polynesian demigod whose exploits were popular in many Polynesian mythologies.

==Hawaii==
In Hawaiian mythology, according to the Kumulipo he is known as Kaha&#x27;inuiahema and according to Tregear, the legends about Kaha’i are &#x27;extremely fragmentary and vague&#x27;, but they indicate that Hema traveled to &#x27;Kahiki&#x27; (perhaps Tahiti, but more probably to &quot;kahiki&quot; &#x27;the distance&#x27;, as &quot;kahiki&quot; can be understood to include all of the islands in the Pacific Ocean) to receive a tribute called &quot;palala&quot; for the birth of his son Kaha’i. There he was captured by the Aiaia (a bird, messenger of the god Kane), died, and was buried in Ulu-paupau. Kaha’i decided to go and avenge his father. A rainbow was the path over which he and his brother ‘Alihi ascended into the skies, where they asked Kane and Kanaloa where Hema&#x27;s remains were to be found. Kaha’i appears in the genealogy of Hawaiian kings.

==Tuamotus==
In the Tuamotuan version of the myth, Tahaki and Karihi are twins, but only Tahaki has magical powers. Tahaki&#x27;s father, Hema, trespassed on lands belonging to the goblins of Matuauru in order to go crabbing. They captured him and took him prisoner, and Tahaki and Karihi begin a quest to rescue him. En route, Karihi accidentally gets snared on the fishing line of their blind grandmother, Kuhi. Tahaki throws coconuts at the old woman and when they hit her, her sight is miraculously restored. Tahaki again sets out to save his father, whom he finds in a pit on Matuaru and rescues. He then proceeds to Hiva-nui, the land of the goblins, with a strong net called Tukutuhuraho-nui (great spider). Ensnaring the goblins, he beats them to death. While returning home via the land of the fish, he gives his dark skin to the Hami-kere fish. After his death, Tahaki goes to the sacred sky of Kane, where it is set apart to rule over Havaiki-nui.

==Mangareva==
In a legend from Mangareva, Tahaki is famous for his reddish skin. During a diving competition off the inner reef, his enemies make Tahaki dive last. As each person dives down, he changes temporarily into a fish and waits below. When at last Tahaki dives, all the fish swarm in, each removing a piece of his beautiful skin. When Tahaki reappears, he is naked. But luckily for him his grandmother is nearby. No sooner does a fish bite off a piece of skin, than the grandmother takes it out of the fish&#x27;s mouth and puts it in her basket. Then she goes back to the underworld, taking with her all of Tahaki&#x27;s skin. Later, the nude Tahaki and his cousin Karihi go down to the underworld, where his grandmother returns each piece of skin to its rightful place. However, some stick insects have helped themselves to pieces of the skin, using it to beautify their armpits. They will not give it back, but the grandmother tells Tahaki not to worry about it, because they only have the skin from the soles of his feet, and no one will notice. So it is that Mangarevan stick insects have red under their arms.

==Samoa==
In the Samoan version of the legend, Tafa&#x27;i, his brother &#x27;Alise, and his sister Ifiifi are the children of Pua and Sigano. Their servant Lauamatoto ascends to heaven in order to find a bride suitable for Tafa&#x27;i. He convinces the goddess Sina-tae-o-i-lagi, daughter of Tagaloa-lagi, to give an audience to the Tafa&#x27;i and his brother, who disguise themselves as ugly old men in order to reach her court safely. Because of their appearance, the goddess rejects them. The next day when they are about to leave, she sees their true appearance and is distraught and chases after them. Tafa&#x27;i threw Sina into a pit, from which she is rescued by his parents, who bring her to live with them. Eventually, Tafa&#x27;i falls in love with her, but she escapes to her home in heaven. Her family convince her to return to earth and marry Tafa&#x27;i, to whom she bears La, the sun, who goes to live with her mother in the sky.

<text>In Māori mythology, Irawaru is the origin of the dog. He is the husband of Hinauri, the sister of Māui. Māui becomes annoyed with Irawaru and stretches out his limbs, turning him into a dog. When Hinauri asks Māui if he has seen her husband, Māui tells her to call &quot;Moi! Moi!&quot; whereupon the poor dog runs up to Hinauri. Learning the truth, she throws herself to Tangaroa (the ocean) never to be seen again.

Versions differ as to the cause of Māui&#x27;s annoyance with his brother-in-law. In some, he is jealous of Irawaru&#x27;s success at fishing; in others, he is angry at Irawaru&#x27;s refusal to give him a cloak, or disgusted at Irawaru&#x27;s greedy nature.

In other Ngā Puhi Nui Tonu mythology, three dogs were brought to Aotearoa by Kupe. These spirits were known as kehua or guardians brought over from Hawaiki. During the arrival to Aotearoa they were sent to Cape Reinga with a few men to guard the escape of their souls. The iwi later was named Ngāti Kurī. Their job was to guard the spirits through to the afterlife.

In traditional Māori society, dogs (&quot;kurī&quot;) were given the best cuts of meat and were highly regarded as sacred. Their fur was highly regarded for cloaks reserved for rangatira.

The story accounts for the characteristics of dogs: they warn of danger or night raids, they respond to commands, and are loyal companions that ward off evil spirits.

<text>In Kiribati, mythology, a sacred tree was known as the &quot;Tree of Many Branches.&quot; It grew from the spine of Na Atibu (the father of the gods), after he died. The spine was buried in Samoa, and the tree Kai-n-tiku-aba grew. This tree was significant to the people as they believed they descended from it. 

Unfortunately, a man named Koura-Abi intentionally chopped down the tree, causing significant disruption and violence among the people. They scattered and were left sorrowful. The tree was also believed to have marked the northern and southern solstices, with its right side being the north solstice (the au-meang) and its left side being the southern solstice (the au-maiaki).

==Origins==
This myth is from Kiribati, to explain why the I-Kiribati migrated to Kiribati from Samoa.

<text>In Hawaiian mythology, Kalamainu&#x27;u (alternate spelling Kalanimainu&#x27;u) was a lizard goddess.

==Myths==
She is said to have lured her lover Puna-ai-koa&#x27;e to her cave where she kept him prisoner. When he longed to go surfing again, Kalamainu&#x27;u gave him her surfboard, but warned him not to speak with anyone. He, however, spoke with two men: Hinale and Aikilolo (or Hinalea and ‘Akilolo) who revealed to him his lover&#x27;s true nature. He returned to her cave, saw her in her true form, but showed no fear. Kalamainu&#x27;u then attempted to slay his informants, but they turned into wrasse and escaped into cracks in the seafloor. To capture them, she learned to set a hina&#x27;i hinalea fishing basket (Craig 1989:95, 218, Beckwith 1940:193, 200).

<text>Richard Marius Joseph Greene (25 August 1918 – 1 June 1985) was a noted English film and television actor. A matinée idol who appeared in more than 40 films, he was perhaps best known for the lead role in the long-running British TV series &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, which ran for 143 episodes from 1955 to 1959.

==Early life==
Greene was born in Plymouth, Devon, England. He was raised Roman Catholic, attending Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School (Kensington, London), which he left at 18. His aunt was actress Evie Greene. His father, Richard Abraham Greene and his mother, Kathleen Gerrard, were both actors with the Plymouth Repertory Theatre. He was the grandson of Richard Bentley Greene and a descendant of four generations of actors.

It has been stated elsewhere that he was the grandson of the inventor William Friese-Greene, (credited by some as the inventor of cinematography) but this was found to be false, as a result of two parallel lines of genealogical research, conducted by the British Film Institute and Paul Pert respectively, the latter being subsequently published in 2009.

==Career==
He started his stage career as a spear carrier in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in 1933. A handsome young man, Greene added to his income by modelling shirts and hats.

His professional career began at the age of 15, with a walk-on role in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; at the Old Vic. He did some modelling work and appeared in a stage production of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; and had a small role in &quot;Sing As We Go&quot; (1934), He joined the Jevan Brandon Repertory Company in 1936 with whom he appeared in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. He won accolades in the same year for his part in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;French Without Tears&quot;, which brought him to the attention of MGM, Alexander Korda and Darryl F. Zanuck, who all made offers for films. On 17 January 1938 Greene signed with Fox.

===20th Century Fox===
At 20, he joined 20th Century Fox as a rival to MGM&#x27;s Robert Taylor. His first film for Fox was John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Four Men and a Prayer&quot; (1938). Greene was a huge success, especially with female film goers, who sent him mountains of fan mail which at its peak rivalled that of Fox star Tyrone Power.

Greene co-starred with Sonia Henie in &quot;My Lucky Star&quot; (1938) and was reunited with Ford in &quot;Submarine Patrol&quot; (1939). Zanuck put him in &quot;Kentucky&quot; (1938) with Loretta Young and Walter Brennan.

Greene was the romantic male lead in the Shirley Temple vehicle &quot;The Little Princess&quot; (1939) and was Sir Henry Baskerville in the 1939 Sherlock Holmes film &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;. The film marked the first pairing of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, but it was Greene who was top billed.

Greene had a support part in &quot;Stanley and Livingstone&quot; (1939) with Spencer Tracy and the lead in &quot;Here I Am a Stranger&quot; (1939). He co-starred with Alice Faye and Fred MacMurray in &quot;Little Old New York&quot; (1940) and supported Vera Zorina in &quot;I Was an Adventuress&quot; (1940). He had failed to become a major star but he was still playing leads in &quot;A&quot; movies when World War II began.

===World War II===
Greene tried to enlist in the Seaforth Highlanders in Vancouver, but they would not give him a commission. He obtained a release from Fox and travelled to England where he enlisted in the 27th Lancers, where he distinguished himself. After three months, he went to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and was commissioned and given the service number of 184251. He was promoted to captain in the 27th Lancers in May 1944.

He was given leave in 1942 to appear in the British propaganda films &quot;Flying Fortress&quot; (1942) for Warners and &quot;Unpublished Story&quot; (1942) with Valerie Hobson. In 1943, he appeared in the Anna Neagle thriller &quot;Yellow Canary&quot; while on leave. He also appeared in a British comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Take It to Heart&quot; (1944).

He later toured in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, entertaining the troops. Greene was discharged in December 1944 and appeared in the stage play &quot;Desert Rats&quot;.

===Return to Hollywood===
After the war he starred in a British musical, distributed by Warners, &quot;Gaiety George&quot; (1946), which was a flop.

He returned to Hollywood, and appeared in Fox&#x27;s big budget &quot;Forever Amber&quot; (1947), but in support of Cornel Wilde. He went to Universal to play the villain in &quot;The Fighting O&#x27;Flynn&quot; (1948) with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. At Fox he was third billed in &quot;The Fan&quot; (1949), based on the play &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;.

Greene returned to England to appear in &quot;That Dangerous Age&quot; (1949) and &quot;Now Barabbas&quot; (1949). He went back to Universal in Hollywood to play the hero in a Yvonne de Carlo eastern, &quot;The Desert Hawk&quot; (1950). Director de Cordova said Greene was &quot;everything a man or woman could want in a desert hero.&quot;

In Britain he was in &quot;My Daughter Joy&quot; (1950), and &quot;Shadow of the Eagle&quot; (1950). He went to Italy to make &quot;The Rival of the Empress&quot; (1951). In 1951, he divorced his wife, Patricia Medina, whom he had married in 1941.

In Hollywood Edward Small asked him to play the male hero of &quot;Lorna Doone&quot; (1951). He stayed on to star in &quot;The Black Castle&quot; (1952) and support Peter Lawford in &quot;Rogue&#x27;s March&quot; (1952). For Small he made &quot;The Bandits of Corsica&quot; (1953), then he was in another swashbuckler, &quot;Captain Scarlett&quot; (1953) shot in Mexico.

===&quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;===

Greene returned to Britain looking for work. Reflecting on his career he said &quot;I haven&#x27;t had the big build-up part I expected. They turned me into a cloak-and-dagger merchant. After four dungeon pictures in a row I decided to throw it up.&quot;

Greene got a role on stage in a production of &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; with Virginia McKenna. Then Yeoman Films of Great Britain approached him for the lead role in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1955–59). He was an immediate success in it. The series and a number of related marketing products bearing his likeness, such as comic books and &quot;Robin Hood Shoes&quot;, solved his financial problems with success both in the United Kingdom and the United States.

During the series&#x27; run he made the occasional film such as &quot;Contraband Spain&quot; (1955), &quot;Beyond the Curtain&quot; (1960), and &quot;Sword of Sherwood Forest&quot; (1960), as Robin Hood.

He had a long love affair in the 1950s with Nancy Oakes, wealthy daughter of mining tycoon Sir Harry Oakes.

===TV and Fu Manchu===
Amongst other TV programmes, Greene was in &quot;A Man For Loving&quot;, &quot;The Doctors&quot;, &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot;, &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, &quot;Scarf Jack&quot;, as corrupt businessman Neil Turvey in &quot;The Professionals&quot; episode &quot;Everest Was Also Conquered&quot;, and the &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; episode &quot;Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel&#x27;s Coat&quot;.

Greene replaced Douglas Wilmer to play Sir Denis Nayland Smith in two of Harry Alan Towers&#x27;s Fu Manchu films, &quot;The Blood of Fu Manchu&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Castle of Fu Manchu&quot; (1969). Both films were directed by Jess Franco and shot in Spain.

==Later life and death==

In 1972 Greene was unwittingly embroiled in the &quot;Lewis v Averay&quot; court case, after a fraudster pretending to be Greene had purchased a vehicle.

Greene died in 1985 of cardiac arrest at his home at Kelling Hall, Norfolk, England, aged 66. His daughter, Patricia, said he had never completely recovered from an injury sustained from a fall three years earlier. &quot;He still had quite a fan club and was receiving letters requesting signed pictures&quot;, she said.

<doc id="96407" wikidata="Q3812662" url="?curid=96407" title="Kamapuaʻa">
<text>In Hawaiian mythology, Kamapuaa (&quot;hog child&quot;) is a hog-man fertility superhuman associated with Lono, the god of agriculture. The son of Hina and Kahikiula, the chief of Oahu, Kamapuaʻa was particularly connected with the island of Maui.

A &quot;kupua&quot; (demigod), Kamapuaa is best known for his romantic pursuit of the fire goddess Pele, with whom he shared a turbulent relationship. Despite Pele&#x27;s power, Kamapuaa&#x27;s persistence allows him to turn her lava rock into fertile soil.

He is linked with the &quot;humuhumunukunukuāpua&#x27;a&quot; (reef triggerfish), the state fish of Hawaiʻi.

Lilikalā Kameʻeleihiwa describes him as &quot;defiant of all authority, bold and untamed,&quot; and states that he &quot;recalls the pig nature that is dormant in most people . . . . Treacherous and tender, he thirsts after the good things in life—adventure, love, and sensual pleasure . . . .&quot;

==Early life==
Kamapua’a was born to human parents, Kahikiula and Hina, on Oahu. He is recorded as having one brother, Kahikihonuakele. There are also many stories involving his grandmother, whom he seems to be very close to. There is not a lot of information on his childhood.

Growing up, Kamapuaʻa was never accepted by his step father Olopana. This hurt Kamapuaʻa because he wanted his father to love him and be proud of him, but Olopana never showed any love and mocked instead. Kamapuaʻa grew with anger and let rage take over his soul. This led to his reputation of being mischievous and rascal.

== Adult life ==
Kamapuaʻa grows up to be a handsome, talented man. His talents made Olopana very angry. Wounded at Olopanaʻs disapproval, Kamapuaʻa leaves for the hills to calm himself, where he spends time scavenging and growing stronger. Later he engages in many battles with Olopana and Pele, eventually killing Olopana brutally.

==Mythology==
In Maui the &quot;kukui&quot; is a symbol of enlightenment, protection and peace. It was said that Kamapua&#x27;a could transform into a &quot;kukui&quot; tree. One of the legends told of Kamapua&#x27;a: one day, a man beat his wife to death and buried her beneath Kamapua&#x27;a while he was in tree form. Because he saw that the woman had been a good person, he raised her to new life, but damned her husband to death.
One well known myth involves Olopana and some birds. Being the Trickster that he was, one day Kamapua’a stole some chickens from Olopana, who was enraged at the theft. Olopana sent his warriors after Kamapua’a, who, along with his own followers, fought back, until it became clear they could not win. Kamapua’a took his followers and fled until they came up against a waterfall where they were seemingly cornered. It was at this point that Kamapua’a shifted into a hog which his followers used to climb to the next level of the falls and to freedom. His pig-form dammed up the water of Kaliuwa‘a where they were. Olopana&#x27;s men pursued. As they trekked up Kaliuwa‘a, Kamapua‘a released the water killing all but Olopana. Olopana flees to Wai‘anae where he ultimately loses to Kamapua‘a.

==Kamapua’a and Pele==
There are contradictory stories depicting the relationship between Kamapua’a and Pele. In some versions they are described as enemies (Hawaiian Romance), in others they are depicted as lovers or husband and wife (Hawaiian folk tales). One story of how Pele and Kamapua’a met starts off with Kamapua’a on a journey to Pele&#x27;s home. Kamapua’a tried to impress Pele and her sisters by looking like a handsome man. He impressed her sisters but Pele is not impressed, instead she insults Kamapua’a by calling him a pig. This upsets Kamapua’a, which then turned their conversation into an argument of insults to each other. Kamapua’a tried to get closer to Pele but Pele sent her flames to him leaving him in a pit of fire. Kamapua’a strikes back by summoning his sister Makahanaloa; she puts out the fire with fog and rain, and hogs run all over the place. All that is left are the fire sticks; Pele accepts her defeat. Kamapua’a takes the sticks and divides the districts giving Pele the districts overrun with lava flows; he takes the Windward districts with the most rain. Kamapua’a leaves Hawaii and starts a family in the ocean where he belongs; Pele now loves Kamapua’a and tries to get him back with a love chant. As Kamapua’a lives his life in the ocean, he still watches over his side of the island. He ventures through the ocean in his new form the humu-humu-nuku-nuku apua’a. He never steps foot on the island again because he doesn&#x27;t want to run into Pele. Kamapuaʹa later returned to the island as a handsome man and made love with Pele. Their union produced a baby girl whom Pele named Kaʹowakaikalani.

<text>In Hawaiian religion, Kamohoaliʻi is a shark god and a brother of Kāne Milohaʻi, Pele, Kapo, Nāmaka, and Hiʻiaka. He is also the father of Nanaue.

Kamohoaliʻi swam in the area around the islands of Maui and Kahoolawe. When a ship was lost at sea, Ka-moho-aliʻi shook his tail in front of the fleet and the kahuna would feed him awa, a narcotic drink, and Kamohoaliʻi would guide the men home. He is sometimes said to have guided the ships of the original inhabitants of Hawaii from the mainland to their island home in this way. 

Kamohoaliʻi had the power to take on the form of any fish and is believed to own multiple underwater caves beneath the ocean where he dwells.

<doc id="96423" wikidata="Q1246476" url="?curid=96423" title="Kumulipo">
<text>In Hawaiian religion, the Kumulipo is the creation chant, first recorded in the 18th century. It also includes a genealogy of the members of Hawaiian royalty and was created in honor of Kalaninuiamamao and passed down orally to his daughter Alapaiwahine.

==Creation chant==

In the &quot;Kumulipo&quot; the world was created over a cosmic night. This is not just one night, but many nights over time. The ancient Hawaiian &quot;kahuna&quot; and priests of the Hawaiian religion would recite the &quot;Kumulipo&quot; during the &quot;makahiki&quot; season, honoring the god Lono. In 1779, Captain James Cook arrived in Kealakekua Bay on the island of Hawaii during the season and was greeted by the Hawaiians reciting the &quot;Kumulipo&quot;. Some stories say Cook was mistaken for Lono, because of the type of sails on his ship and his pale skintone.
In 1889, King Kalākaua printed a sixty-page pamphlet of the &quot;Kumulipo&quot;. Attached to the pamphlet was a 2-page paper on how the chant was originally composed and recited.

Years later Queen Liliuokalani described the chant as a prayer of the development of the universe and the ancestry of the Hawaiians. Liliuokalani translated the chant under house arrest in Iolani Palace. The translation was published in 1897, then republished by Pueo Press in 1978.

The &quot;Kumulipo&quot; is a total of 2,102 lines long, in honor of Kalaninuiamamao, who created peace for all when he was born. There was a lot of fighting between his ʻI and Keawe family, who were cousins so his birth stopped the two from feuding. The &quot;Kumulipo&quot; is a cosmogonic genealogy, which means that it relates to the creation of the universe and the descent of humans and other entities. Out of the 2102 lines, it has 16 &quot;wā&quot; which means era or age. In each &quot;wā&quot;, something is born whether it is a human, plant, or other creature.

==Divisions==
The &quot;Kumulipo&quot; is divided into sixteen &quot;wā&quot;, sections. The first seven &quot;wā&quot; fall under the section of &quot;pō&quot; (darkness), the age of spirit. The Earth may or may not exist, but the events described do not take place in a physical universe. The words show the development of life as it goes through similar stages as a human child. All plants and animals of sea and land, earth and sky, male and female are created. Eventually, it leads to early mammals.

These are the first twelve lines of the &quot;Kumulipo&quot;, in Hawaiian, in Liliuokalani&#x27;s English translation and in Bastian&#x27;s German translation. Two other significant English translations - Rock&#x27;s translation of Bastian and Beckwith&#x27;s translation - appear in Beckwith&#x27;s 1951 book &quot;The Kumulipo&quot;.

The second section, containing the remaining nine wā, is &quot;ao&quot; and is signaled by the arrival of light and the gods, who watch over the changing of animals into the first humans. After that is the complex genealogy of Kalaninuiamamao that goes all the way to the late 18th century.

==Births in each &quot;wā&quot;==
The births in each age include:
# In the first &quot;wā&quot;, the sea urchins and &quot;limu&quot; (seaweed) were born. The &quot;limu&quot; was connected through its name to the land ferns. Some of these &quot;limu&quot; and fern pairs include: ʻEkaha and ʻEkahakaha, Limu ʻAʻalaʻula and ʻalaʻalawainui mint, Limu Manauea and Kalo Maunauea upland taro, Limu Kala and ʻakala berry. These plants were born to protect their sea cousins.
# In the second &quot;wā&quot;, 73 types of fish. Some deep sea fish include &quot;Naiʻa&quot; (porpoise) and the &quot;Mano&quot; (shark). Also reef fish, including &quot;Moi&quot; and &quot;Weke&quot;. Certain plants that have similar names are related to these fish and are born as protectors of the fish.
# In the third &quot;wā&quot;, 52 types of flying creatures, which include birds of the sea such as ʻIwa (frigate or man-of-war bird), the Lupe, and the Noio (Hawaiian noddy tern). These sea birds have land relatives, such as &quot;Io&quot; (hawk), &quot;Nene&quot; (goose), and &quot;Pueo&quot; (owl). In this wā, insects were also born, such as Peʻelua (caterpillar) and the Pulelehua (butterfly).
# In the fourth &quot;wā&quot;, the creepy and crawly creatures are born. These include &quot;Honu&quot; (sea turtle), &quot;Ula&quot; (lobster), &quot;Moʻo&quot; (lizards), and &quot;Pololia&quot; (jellyfish). Their cousins on land include &quot;Kuhonua&quot; (maile vine) and &quot;ʻOheʻohe&quot; bamboo.
# In the fifth &quot;wā&quot;, &quot;Kalo&quot; (taro) is born.
# In the sixth &quot;wā&quot;, &quot;Uku&quot; (flea) and the &quot;ʻIole&quot; (rat) are born.
# In the seventh &quot;wā&quot;, &quot;ʻĪlio&quot; (dog) and the &quot;Peʻapeʻa&quot; (bat) are born.
# In the eighth &quot;wā&quot;, the four divinities are born: Laʻilaʻi (Female), Kiʻi (Male), Kāne (God), Kanaloa (Octopus), respectively.
# In the ninth &quot;wā&quot;, Laʻilaʻi takes her eldest brother Kiʻi as a mate and the first humans are born from her brain.
# In the tenth &quot;wā&quot;, Laʻilaʻi takes her next brother Kāne as a mate after losing interest in Kiʻi, she then had four of Kāne&#x27;s children: Laʻiʻoloʻolo, Kamahaʻina (Male), Kamamule (Male), Kamakalua (Female). Laʻilaʻi soon returned to Kiʻi and three children are born: Haʻi(F), Haliʻa(F), and Hākea(M). Having been born during their mothers being with two men they become &quot;Poʻolua&quot; and claim the lineage of both fathers.
# The eleventh &quot;wā&quot; pays homage to the Moa.
# The twelfth &quot;wā&quot; honors the lineage of Wākea, whose son Hāloa is the ancestor of all people.
# The thirteenth &quot;wā&quot; honors the lineage of Hāloa&#x27;s mother Papahānaumoku.
# In the fourteenth &quot;wā&quot; Liʻaikūhonua mates with Keakahulihonua, and have their child Laka.
# The fifteenth &quot;wā&quot; refers to Haumeanuiʻāiwaiwa and her lineage, it also explains Māui&#x27;s adventures and siblings.
# The sixteenth &quot;wā&quot; recounts all of Māui&#x27;s lineage for forty-four generations, all the way down to the &quot;Moʻi&quot; of Māui, Piʻilani.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, anthropologists Adolf Bastian and Roland Burrage Dixon interpreted a recurring verse of the Kumulipo as describing the octopus as the sole survivor of a previous age of existence. In her 1951 translation of the Kumulipo, ethnographer Martha Warren Beckwith provided a different translation of the verse, although she does discuss the possibility that &quot;octopus&quot; is the correct translation and describes the god Kanaloa.

== Comparative literature ==
Comparisons may be made between marital partners (husband and wife often have synonymous names), between genealogical and flora-fauna names, and in other Polynesian genealogies.

== Cultural impact ==
The supermassive black hole M87*, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope, was informally given the Hawaiian name &quot;Pōwehi&quot;, a poetic description of generative darkness or the spirit world taken from the &quot;Kumulipo&quot;.

In 2009, the poet Jamaica Heolimeleikalani Osorio performed her poem, Kumulipo, at a poetry event at the White House.

<doc id="96425" wikidata="Q2310726" url="?curid=96425" title="Kupua">
<text>In Hawaiian mythology, the Kupua are a group of supernatural entities which might be considered gods or spirits (see also &quot;Atua&quot;).

Hawaiian myths and legends abound with such characters. They are traditionally described as monsters having the power of appearing in different kinds of bodies. They usually have cruel and vindictive characters and are ready to destroy and devour any persons they can catch. There are, however, many kupuas of kindly spirit who give watchful care to the members of their own families.

Many Hawaiian kupua are considered as gods having a double body, sometimes appearing as a man and sometimes being able to change shape, into an animal, vegetable, or mineral form. The latter form always possesses supernatural powers. William Westervelt mentions the following classification for kupua:
* Ka-poe-kino-lau (the people who had leaf bodies)
* Ka-poe-kino-pua (the people who had flower bodies)
* Ka-poe-kino-manu (the people who had bird bodies)
* Ka-poe-kino-laau (trees of all kinds, ferns, vines, etc.)
* Ka-poe-kino-pupu (all shells)
* Ka-poe-kino-ao (all clouds)
* Ka-poe-kino-maani (all winds)
* Ka-poe-kina-ia (all fish)
* Ka-poe-kina-mano (all sharks)
* Ka-poe-kina-limu (all sea-mosses)
* Ka-poe-kina-pokaku (all peculiar stones)
* Ka-poe-kina-hiwa-hiwa (all dangerous places of the pali)

==Famous kupua in Hawaiian legends==
Mamala the surf-rider was a chieftess of kupua character. She might appear as a shark, a lizard, or a woman. Her surfing skills were so impressive that people would gather on the beach to applaud her performance. She was married to the shark-man Ouha, but later left him for a chief named Hono-kau-pu.

In an old Honolulu legend, a kupua, who is a dog-man, overthrows the government of Kahanai and becomes the ruling power between Nuuanu Valley and the sea. He is a cannibal, and many of the people are killed and eaten by him. He can appear at will either as a man or a dog.

In Maui, the king once had a kupua, a rooster, which was very cruel and destructive. He could assume a different bird form for each magic power he possessed. This, with his miraculous human powers, made him superior to all the roosters which had ever been his antagonists in cock-fighting.

In Kauai, Akua-pehu-ale (god-of-the-swollen-billow) was a kupua who devoured his enemies and was greatly feared and hated even by his own tribe.

In the legend of the bread-fruit tree, Papa, one of the ancestors of the people living in all the islands now known as Polynesia, is described as a kupua. Her daughter Kap-ula-kinau also has kupua, or magic power.

Other Hawaiian kupua mentioned in the mythology include the famous tricksters Māui and Kamapua&#x27;a, Iwa, Ono, and Pekoi, amongst others.

<text>Mary Flannery O&#x27;Connor (March 25, 1925August 3, 1964) was an American novelist, short story writer, and essayist. She wrote two novels and 31 short stories, as well as a number of reviews and commentaries.

She was a Southern writer, who often wrote in a sardonic Southern Gothic style, and she relied, heavily, on regional settings and grotesque characters, often in violent situations. In her writing, an unsentimental acceptance or rejection of the limitations, imperfections or differences of these characters (whether attributed to disability, race, crime, religion or sanity) typically underpins the drama.

Her writing often reflects her Catholic faith, and frequently examines questions of morality and ethics. Her posthumously compiled &quot;Complete Stories&quot; won the 1972 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction and has been the subject of enduring praise.

==Early life and education==
===Childhood===
O&#x27;Connor was born on March 25, 1925, in Savannah, Georgia, the only child of Edward Francis O&#x27;Connor, a real estate agent, and Regina Cline, both of Irish descent. As an adult, she remembered herself as a &quot;pigeon-toed child with a receding chin and a you-leave-me-alone-or-I&#x27;ll-bite-you complex&quot;. The Flannery O&#x27;Connor Childhood Home museum is located at 207 E. Charlton Street on Lafayette Square.

In 1940, O&#x27;Connor and her family moved to Milledgeville, Georgia, where they initially lived with her mother&#x27;s family at the so-called &#x27;Cline Mansion,&#x27; in town. In 1937, her father was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, which led to his eventual death on February 1, 1941. O&#x27;Connor and her mother continued to live in Milledgeville. In 1951, they moved to Andalusia Farm, which is now a museum dedicated to O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s work.

===School===
O&#x27;Connor attended Peabody High School, where she worked as the school newspaper&#x27;s art editor and from which she graduated in 1942. She entered Georgia State College for Women (now Georgia College &amp; State University) in an accelerated three-year program and graduated in June 1945 with a B.A. in sociology and English literature. While at Georgia College, she produced a significant amount of cartoon work for the student newspaper. Many critics have claimed that the idiosyncratic style and approach of these early cartoons shaped her later fiction, in important ways.
In 1945, she was accepted into the prestigious Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop at the University of Iowa, where she went, at first, to study journalism. While there, she got to know several important writers and critics who lectured or taught in the program, among them Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom, Robie Macauley, Austin Warren and Andrew Lytle. Lytle, for many years editor of the &quot;Sewanee Review&quot;, was one of the earliest admirers of her fiction. He later published several of her stories in the &quot;Sewanee Review&quot;, as well as critical essays on her work. Workshop director Paul Engle was the first to read and comment on the initial drafts of what would become &quot;Wise Blood&quot;. She received an M.F.A. from the University of Iowa, in 1947. She remained at the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop for another year, after completing her degree on a fellowship. During the summer of 1948, O&#x27;Connor continued to work on &quot;Wise Blood&quot; at Yaddo, an artists&#x27; community in Saratoga Springs, New York, where she also completed several short stories.

In 1949 O&#x27;Connor met and eventually accepted an invitation to stay with Robert Fitzgerald (a well-known translator of the classics) and his wife, Sally, in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

==Career==
O&#x27;Connor is primarily known for her short stories. She published two books of short stories: &quot;A Good Man Is Hard to Find&quot; (1955) and &quot;Everything That Rises Must Converge&quot; (published posthumously in 1965). Many of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s short stories have been re-published in major anthologies, including &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot; and &quot;Prize Stories&quot;.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s two novels are &quot;Wise Blood&quot; (1952) (made into a film by John Huston) and &quot;The Violent Bear It Away&quot; (1960). She also has had several books of her other writings published, and her enduring influence is attested by a growing body of scholarly studies of her work.

Fragments exist of an unfinished novel tentatively titled &quot;Why Do the Heathen Rage?&quot; that draws from several of her short stories, including &quot;Why Do the Heathen Rage?&quot;, &quot;The Enduring Chill&quot;, and &quot;The Partridge Festival&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Regarding her emphasis of the grotesque, O&#x27;Connor said: &quot;[A]nything that comes out of the South is going to be called grotesque by the northern reader, unless it is grotesque, in which case, it is going to be called realistic.&quot; Her fiction is usually set in the South and features morally flawed protagonists who frequently interact with characters with disabilities or are disabled themselves (as O&#x27;Connor was by lupus). The issue of race often appears. Most of her works feature disturbing elements, although she did not like to be characterized as cynical. &quot;I am mighty tired of reading reviews that call &quot;A Good Man&quot; brutal and sarcastic,&quot; she wrote. &quot;The stories are hard, but they are hard, because there is nothing harder or less sentimental than Christian realism. When I see these stories described as horror stories, I am always amused, because the reviewer always has hold of the wrong horror.&quot;

She felt deeply informed by the sacramental and by the Thomist notion that the created world is charged with God. Yet, she did not write apologetic fiction of the kind prevalent in the Catholic literature of the time, explaining that a writer&#x27;s meaning must be evident, in his or her fiction, without didacticism. She wrote ironic, subtly allegorical fiction about deceptively backward Southern characters, usually fundamentalist Protestants, who undergo transformations of character that, to her thinking, brought them closer to the Catholic mind. The transformation is often accomplished through pain, violence, and ludicrous behavior in the pursuit of the holy. However grotesque the setting, she tried to portray her characters as open to the touch of divine grace. This ruled out a sentimental understanding of the stories&#x27; violence, as of her own illness. She wrote: &quot;Grace changes us, and the change is painful.&quot;

She had a deeply sardonic sense of humor, often based on the disparity between her characters&#x27; limited perceptions and the extraordinary fate awaiting them. Another frequent source of humor is the attempt of well-meaning liberals to cope with the rural South on their own terms. O&#x27;Connor used such characters&#x27; inability to come to terms with disability, race, poverty, and fundamentalism, other than in sentimental illusions, to illustrate her view that the secular world was failing in the twentieth century.

In several stories, O&#x27;Connor explored a number of contemporary issues from the perspective of both her fundamentalist and liberal characters. She addressed the Holocaust in her story &quot;The Displaced Person&quot;, racial integration in &quot;Everything That Rises Must Converge&quot;, and intersexuality, in &quot;A Temple of the Holy Ghost&quot;. Her fiction often included references to the problem of race in the South. Occasionally, racial issues come to the forefront, as in &quot;The Artificial Nigger&quot;, &quot;Everything that Rises Must Converge&quot;, and &quot;Judgement Day&quot;, her last short story, and a drastically rewritten version of her first published story, &quot;The Geranium&quot;. 

Despite her secluded life, her writing reveals an uncanny grasp of the nuances of human behavior. O&#x27;Connor gave many lectures on faith and literature, traveling quite far, despite her frail health. Politically, she maintained a broadly progressive outlook, in connection with her faith, voting for John F. Kennedy in 1960 and outwardly supporting the work of Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement. Despite this, she made her personal stance on race and integration known, throughout her life, such as in several letters to playwright Maryat Lee, which she wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Mrs Turpin&quot;, saying, &quot;You know, I&#x27;m an integrationist, by principle, and a segregationist, by taste. I don&#x27;t &quot;like&quot; negroes. They all give me a pain, and the more of them I see, the less and less I like them. Particularly the new kind&quot;. According to O&#x27;Connor biographer, Brad Gooch, there are also &quot;letters where she even talks about a friend that she makes in graduate school at the University of Iowa who is Black, and she defends this friendship to her own mother, in letters. It&#x27;s complicated to look at, and I don&#x27;t think that we can box her in.&quot;

==Illness and death==
By the summer of 1952, O&#x27;Connor was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), as her father had been, before her. She remained, for the rest of her life, at Andalusia. O&#x27;Connor lived for twelve years after her diagnosis, which was seven years longer than expected.

Her daily routine was to attend Mass, write in the morning, then, spend the rest of the day recuperating and reading. Despite the debilitating effects of the steroid drugs used to treat O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s lupus, she, nonetheless, made over sixty appearances at lectures to read her works.

In the PBS documentary, &quot;Flannery&quot;, the writer Alice McDermott explains the impact lupus had on O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s work, saying, &quot;It was the illness, I think, which made her the writer she is.&quot;

O&#x27;Connor completed more than two dozen short stories and two novels, while living with lupus. She died on August 3, 1964, at the age of 39 in Baldwin County Hospital. Her death was caused by complications from a new attack of lupus, following surgery for a uterine fibroid. She is buried in Milledgeville, Georgia, at Memory Hill Cemetery.

==Letters==
Throughout her life, O&#x27;Connor maintained a wide correspondence with writers that included Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop, English professor Samuel Ashley Brown, Catholic nun and literary critic M. Bernetta Quinn, and playwright Maryat Lee. After her death, a selection of her letters, edited by her friend, Sally Fitzgerald, was published as &quot;The Habit of Being&quot;. Much of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s best-known writing on religion, writing, and the South is contained in these and other letters.

In 1955, Betty Hester, an Atlanta file clerk, wrote O&#x27;Connor a letter, expressing admiration for her work. Hester&#x27;s letter drew O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s attention, and they corresponded, frequently. For &quot;The Habit of Being&quot;, Hester provided Fitzgerald with all the letters she received from O&#x27;Connor but requested that her identity be kept private. She was identified, only, as &quot;A.&quot; The complete collection of the unedited letters between O&#x27;Connor and Hester was unveiled by Emory University, in May 2007. The letters had been given to the university, in 1987, with the stipulation that they not be released to the public for 20 years.

Emory University also contains the more than 600 letters O&#x27;Connor wrote to her mother, Regina, nearly every day, while she was pursuing her literary career in Iowa City, New York, and Massachusetts. Some of these describe &quot;travel itineraries and plumbing mishaps, ripped stockings and roommates with loud radios,&quot; as well as her request for the homemade mayonnaise of her childhood. O&#x27;Connor lived with her mother for 34 of her 39 years of life.

==Catholicism==
O&#x27;Connor was a devout Catholic. From 1956 through 1964, she wrote more than one hundred book reviews for two Catholic diocesan newspapers in Georgia: &quot;The Bulletin&quot; and &quot;The Southern Cross&quot;. According to fellow reviewer Joey Zuber, the wide range of books she chose to review demonstrated that she was profoundly intellectual. Her reviews consistently confronted theological and ethical themes in books written by the most serious and demanding theologians of her time. Professor of English Carter Martin, an authority on O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s writings, notes simply that her &quot;book reviews are at one with her religious life&quot;.

A prayer journal O&#x27;Connor had kept during her time at the University of Iowa was published in 2013. It included prayers and ruminations on faith, writing, and O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s relationship with God.

==Interest in birds==
O&#x27;Connor frequently used bird imagery within her fiction.

When she was six, O&#x27;Connor experienced her first brush with celebrity status. Pathé News filmed &quot;Little Mary O&#x27;Connor&quot; with O&#x27;Connor and her trained chicken and showed the film around the country. She said: &quot;When I was six I had a chicken that walked backward and was in the Pathé News. I was in it too with the chicken. I was just there to assist the chicken but it was the high point in my life. Everything since has been an anticlimax.&quot;

In high school, when the girls were required to sew Sunday dresses for themselves, O&#x27;Connor sewed a full outfit of underwear and clothes to fit her pet duck and brought the duck to school to model it.

As an adult at Andalusia, she raised and nurtured some 100 peafowl. Fascinated by birds of all kinds, she raised ducks, ostriches, emus, toucans, and any sort of exotic bird she could obtain, while incorporating peacock imagery in her writing. She described her peacocks in an essay titled &quot;The King of the Birds&quot;.

==Legacy, awards, and tributes==
O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;Complete Stories&quot; won the 1972 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction and, in a 2009 online poll, was named the best book ever to have won the National Book Awards.

In June 2015, the United States Postal Service honored O&#x27;Connor with a new postage stamp, the 30th issuance in the Literary Arts series. Some criticized the stamp as failing to reflect O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s character and legacy.

She was inducted into the Savannah Women of Vision investiture in 2016.

The Flannery O&#x27;Connor Award for Short Fiction, named in honor of O&#x27;Connor by the University of Georgia Press, is a prize given annually since 1983 to an outstanding collection of short stories.

Killdozer published the song &quot;Lupus&quot;, based on the disease that took O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s life. Her name is mentioned many times in this song; it can be found on the 1989 album &quot;12 Point Buck&quot;.

The Flannery O&#x27;Connor Book Trail is a series of Little Free Libraries stretching between O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s homes in Savannah and Milledgeville.

The Flannery O&#x27;Connor Childhood Home is a historic house museum in Savannah, Georgia, where O&#x27;Connor lived during her childhood. In addition to serving as a museum, the house hosts regular events and programs.

Loyola University Maryland had a student dormitory named for O&#x27;Connor. In 2020, Flannery O&#x27;Connor Hall was renamed in honor of activist Sister Thea Bowman. The announcement also mentions, &quot;This renaming comes after recent recognition of Flannery O&#x27;Connor, a 20th century Catholic American writer, and the racism present in some of her work.&quot;

The &quot;Flannery List&quot;, named after O&#x27;Connor is a curated list of musicals and plays that &quot;&quot;deal in an interesting way with faith, religion, and/or spirituality.&quot;

The film, &quot;Flannery: The Storied Life of the Writer from Georgia&quot; has been described as the story of a writer &quot;who wrestled with the greater mysteries of existence.&quot;

In 2023, the biographical film &quot;Wildcat&quot; was released. Co-written and directed by Ethan Hawke and starring his daughter as Flannery O&#x27;Connor, the film features a dramatization of O&#x27;Connor trying to publish &quot;Wise Blood,&quot; interspersed with scenes from her short fiction.

In 2024, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;Why Do the Heathen Rage?&quot; was published by Brazos Press. Jessica Hooten Wilson assembled scenes from O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s drafts and supplied her own critical commentary.

<text>is a semi-dwarf wheat cultivar with very large ears that was bred by at an experimental station in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. Its parents were a semi-dwarf Japanese landrace that may have originated in Korea in the 3rd or 4th century AD, and two varieties from the USA. In 1935 it was registered as a numbered cultivar by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry . 

Norin 10 grew to just two feet (60 - 100 cm) tall, instead of the usual four (150 cm). It provided two genes, &quot;Rht1&quot; and &quot;Rht2&quot;, that resulted in reduced-height wheats, thus allowing better nutrient uptake and tillage, since when heavily fertilised with nitrogen, tall varieties grow too high, become top-heavy, and lodge.

The &quot;Rht1&quot; and &quot;Rht2&quot; genes have been used in wheat breeding programmes worldwide to provide shorter plants with higher yields. Cecil Salmon, a biologist and wheat expert on General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s team in Japan after 1945, collected 16 varieties of wheat including Norin 10. He sent these seeds to Orville Vogel at Washington State University and they were used within USA breeding programmes in the 1950s. Norin 10 was also provided to the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico. It was used here by Norman Borlaug and collaborators in crosses with local varieties to produce dwarf varieties that were also daylight-insensitive and had resistance to rust disease. These were subsequently distributed worldwide. These included high-output varieties tested in India (Lerma Rojo 64 and Sonora 64) during the Green Revolution.

Norin 10 helped developing countries, such as India and Pakistan, to increase the productivity of their crops by approximately 60% during the Green Revolution.

<text>Gerald Jay Sussman (born February 8, 1947) is the Panasonic Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He has been involved in artificial intelligence (AI) research at MIT since 1964. His research has centered on understanding the problem-solving strategies used by scientists and engineers, with the goals of automating parts of the process and formalizing it to provide more effective methods of science and engineering education. Sussman has also worked in computer languages, in computer architecture, and in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design.

==Education==
Sussman attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an undergraduate and received his SB in mathematics in 1968. He continued his studies at MIT and obtained a PhD in 1973, also in mathematics, under the supervision of Seymour Papert. His doctoral thesis was titled &quot;A Computational Model of Skill Acquisition&quot; focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning, using a computational performance model named &quot;HACKER&quot;.

According to a common story, in 1966, Marvin Minsky tasked his student Gerald Jay Sussman to “spend the summer linking a camera to a computer and getting the computer to describe what it saw.” This story was often told to illustrate that the difficulty of computer vision was not apparent to AI researchers in the early days.

==Academic work==
Sussman is a coauthor (with Hal Abelson and Julie Sussman) of the introductory computer science textbook &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; (SICP). It was used at MIT for several decades, and has been translated into several languages.

Sussman&#x27;s contributions to artificial intelligence include problem solving by debugging almost-right plans, propagation of constraints applied to electrical circuit analysis and synthesis, dependency-based explanation and dependency-based backtracking, and various language structures for expressing problem-solving strategies. Sussman and his former student, Guy L. Steele Jr., invented the programming language Scheme in 1975.

Sussman saw that artificial intelligence ideas can be applied to computer-aided design (CAD). Sussman developed, with his graduate students, sophisticated computer-aided design tools for Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI). Steele made the first Scheme hardware chips in 1978. These ideas and the AI-based CAD technology to support them were further developed in the Scheme chips of 1979 and 1981. The technique and experience developed were then used to design other special-purpose computers. 

Sussman was the principal designer of the Digital Orrery, a machine designed to do high-precision integrations for orbital mechanics experiments. The Orrery hardware was designed and built by a few people in a few months, using AI-based simulation and compiling tools.

Using the Digital Orrery, Sussman has worked with Jack Wisdom to discover numerical evidence for chaotic motions in the outer planets. The Digital Orrery machine is now retired at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.z Sussman was also the lead designer of the Supercomputer Toolkit, another multiprocessor computer optimized for evolving of ordinary differential equations. The Supercomputer Toolkit was used by Sussman and Wisdom to confirm and extend the discoveries made with the Digital Orrery to include the entire planetary system.

Sussman has pioneered the use of computational descriptions to communicate methodological ideas in teaching subjects in Electrical Circuits and in Signals and Systems. Over the past decade Sussman and Wisdom have developed a subject that uses computational techniques to communicate a deeper understanding of advanced classical mechanics. In &quot;Computer Science: Reflections on the Field, Reflections from the Field&quot;, he writes &quot;... computational algorithms are used to express the methods used in the analysis of dynamical phenomena. Expressing the methods in a computer language forces them to be unambiguous and computationally effective. Students are expected to read the programs and to extend them and to write new ones. The task of formulating a method as a computer-executable program and debugging that program is a powerful exercise in the learning process. Also, once formalized procedurally, a mathematical idea becomes a tool that can be used directly to compute results.&quot; Sussman and Wisdom, with Meinhard Mayer, have produced a textbook, &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics&quot; (SICM), to capture these new ideas.

Sussman and Abelson have also been a part of the free software movement, including releasing MIT/GNU Scheme as free software and serving on the board of directors of the Free Software Foundation.

Sussman&#x27;s work is presented in many videos, such as: with Hal Abelson in a full 20-lecture version of MIT&#x27;s SICP course, for LispNYC, at the International Conference on Complex Systems, for ArsDigita University, and giving the keynote talk at a Strange Loop conference.

==Awards and organizations==
For his contributions to computer science education, Sussman received the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Karl Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award in 1990, and the Amar G. Bose award for teaching in 1992.

, Sussman is the only founding director who is still active on the board of directors of the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

In 2023 he received the IEEE Computer Society’s Taylor L. Booth Education Award for his “inspirational approach to the teaching of computer science through functional programming&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gerald Sussman is married to computer programmer Julie Sussman.

In 2011, Sussman attended an event on Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s private island, Little Saint James, known as the &quot;Mindshift Conference&quot;, hosted by Epstein and Al Seckel. Sussman was also quoted on Epstein&#x27;s website saying “Jeffrey Epstein is one of the most amazing, interesting, and brilliant people that I know.” 

Sussman is a bonded locksmith, and also does hands-on work with precision mechanical watch movements, as well as amateur telescope making. He has given public lectures on the physics and mathematics of watch escapements. He is a life member of the American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute.

<doc id="96432" wikidata="Q514506" url="?curid=96432" title="Owari Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area that today forms the western half of Aichi Prefecture, including the modern city of Nagoya. The province was created in 646. Owari bordered on Mikawa, Mino, and Ise Provinces. Owari and Mino provinces were separated by the Sakai River, which means &quot;border river.&quot; The province&#x27;s abbreviated name was . 
Owari is classified as one of the provinces of the Tōkaidō. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Owari was ranked as a &quot;superior country&quot; (上国) and a &quot;near country&quot; (近国), in relation to its distance from the capital.

==History==
Owari is mentioned in records of the Nara period, including the &quot;Kujiki&quot;, although the area has been settled since at least the Japanese Paleolithic period, as evidenced by numerous remains found by archaeologists. Early records mention a powerful “Owari clan”, vaguely related to, or allied with the Yamato clan, who built massive kofun burial mounds in several locations within the province, from which archaeologists have recovered bronze artifacts and mirrors dating from the 4th century. Atsuta Shrine is of very ancient origin, ranking with Ise Shrine in importance, and is the repository of one of the Imperial Regalia of Japan, the &quot;Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi&quot;.

Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Owari was divided into eight counties, which persisted as administrative units into the Edo period.
The exact location of the provincial capital is not known, but is traditionally considered to have been located in what is now the city of Inazawa, although the &quot;Ichinomiya&quot; of the province is located in what is now Ichinomiya.

During the Heian period, the province was divided into numerous &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by local samurai clans. However, by the Sengoku period, the province had fragmented into many small territories largely dominated by the Oda clan. Under Oda Nobunaga, the province was reunified. Nobunaga began his campaign to reunify Japan from his stronghold at Kiyosu Castle. and many of his retainers (who later became &quot;daimyōs&quot; under the Tokugawa shogunate) were natives of Owari, including Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Katō Kiyomasa.

Under Tokugawa Ieyasu, the province was assigned as a feudal domain to his ninth son, Tokugawa Yoshinao with official revenues of 619,500 &quot;koku&quot;, the largest domain in the Tokugawa clan holdings outside of the shogunate itself. Yoshinao was founder of the Owari Tokugawa clan, one of the &quot;Gosanke&quot;, which had the hereditary right of succession to the position of &quot;shōgun&quot; should the main line fail. The castle town of Nagoya prospered during this period, and Owari Province was especially known for its ceramics industry.

Following the abolition of the han system in 1871 after the Meiji Restoration, former Owari Domain and Inuyama Domain were transformed into short-lived prefectures, which were joined with Nukata Prefecture, which was the former Mikawa Province, to form the new Aichi Prefecture in January 1872. At the same time, the province continued to exist for some purposes. For example, Owari is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.

==Bakumatsu-period domains in Owari Province==
==Historical districts==
Owari Province consisted of eleven districts:

*** Higashikasugai District (東春日井郡) – dissolved
*** Nishikasugai District (西春日井郡)
** Kaisei District (海西郡; West Ama) – merged with Kaitō District to Ama District (海部郡) on April 4, 1913
** Kaitō District (海東郡; East Ama) – merged with Kaisei District to Ama District on April 4, 1913

<text>In Hawaiian mythology, Laʻamaomao is the goddess of the wind, she carried a gourd that contains all the winds of Hawai‘i, &quot;which could be called forth by chanting their names&quot;, the gourd was passed down byLa‘amaomao, the Hawaiian wind goddess (lit. “distant sacredness”), to her granddaughter La‘amaomao; to her granddaughter’s son Paka‘a; to Paka‘a’s son, Ku-a-Paka‘a. In “The Triple Marriage of Laa-Mai-Kahiki” (Kalākaua, &quot;The Legends and Myths of Hawaii&quot;), La‘amaomao is described as a god rather than a goddess. He accompanies Moikeha to Hawai‘i from Kahiki and settles at Hale-o-Lono on the island of Moloka‘i, where he was worshiped as an ‘aumakua, or deity, of the winds. The female gender of the wind deity in the Paka‘a story seems to be a Hawaiian development as the wind deity in other Polynesian traditions is male (Ra‘a—Society Islands, Raka—Cook Islands, Raka-maomao—New Zealand).The male version of the wind divinity was said to be created in the midst of chaos by his father, the sun god. Largely a benevolent entity, he is the god of forgiveness.

<doc id="96440" wikidata="Q17052651" url="?curid=96440" title="Laufakana'a">
<text>In the Polynesian mythology of Tonga, Laufakanaa (speak to silence; i.e.: command [the winds] to calm down) was a primordial creator god, and his home was Ata. 

In Tongan cosmogony, the sky and the sea, and the land of Pulotu (the dark underworld, the home of the souls of departed chiefs) existed from the earliest times. All other lands were created later. Either they were thrown down from the sky by Havea Hikuleo or, subsequently, they were fished up by Maui from the bottom of the ocean. All the &quot;makafonua&quot; (landstones) of Hikuleo were full of unevenness, and tended to jump around (that is, they were the source of earthquakes) and were full of holes and pits (that is, volcanoes), while Maui&#x27;s lands were smooth (coral islands and atolls). ʻAta and ʻEua, the islands which were fished up first, were quite hilly, as Maui apparently was not an expert fisherman yet. His next catch, (Tongatapu) he kept much smoother.

The first people of Ata came forth directly from the same &quot;uanga&quot; (fly larva, maggot) as Kohai, Koau, mo Momo, and were the ancestors of all other men. At that time the god Tamapoulialamafoa was the king of the sky, and he commanded some of the Tangaloa gods to tell the &quot;faahikehe&quot; (sub-god) Laufakanaa to go down to the realm of light (i.e. the earth, not Pulotu) to become ruler of Ata and also ruler of the winds. Whenever a boat came to Ata in stormy weather, Laufakanaa had to listen to the prayers of the crew and give them a good wind to sail on. The prayer had to consist of an offering of &quot;mā&quot; (bread) cooked in the oil of the grated coconut.

Laufakanaa also brought a special fishing net with him. This typical Ata-net was used by the islanders on special occasions, as when they went fishing for the Tuʻi Tonga. As well, the &quot;putalinga&quot; (a kind of plantain), the &quot;sī&quot; (ti (plant)), the &quot;ngū-ata&quot; and &quot;tua-ata&quot; yams were brought down from the sky by Laufakanaa and first grew on Ata, before they spread to the other islands.

<text>In Māori tradition, the Maero (or Mohoao) are an iwi-atua or supernatural people from New Zealand. They are sometimes described as giants or wild men of the woods, and inhabit mountains and forest, particularly in the South Island and Tararua Range. Maero are characterised as wild, malevolent and often violent, carrying stone clubs as weapons. They are covered in dark body hair and have long, bony fingers with sharp fingernails. They kill and eat humans and other animals.

The Maero are said to harbour anger towards the Māori, who arrived from Hawaiki, and are thought to have displaced them and ruined the tapu (sacredness) of their homes, forcing them to dwell in inhospitable alpine regions.

==In traditional Māori stories==

In a story from the Whanganui area told by Tuao, chief of Upper Whanganui, Tukoio, a mortal man, once found a maero, a &quot;mohoao&quot; (wild man), and attacked it, cutting off its arms, legs and head. He brought the head back, but it was still alive and called for help. Tukoio did not want to fight a whole clan of maero, so he dropped it and came back later with reinforcements, only to find the maero had put itself back together and returned to the forest.

<text>Tukoio is the name of a legendary or mythological chief in Māori mythology.

In a story from the Māori tradition of the Whanganui area, Tukoio, a mortal man, came across a Maero or Mohoao, a wild person or monster much feared in Maori legend. The creature instantly attacked him, fighting fiercely until Tukoio cut off its limbs and head, which he took as a trophy back to his village. However, when the severed head cried out for help from its clan, Tukoio instantly dropped the head and ran, fearing retaliation. When he and some of his villagers returned, they found the Mohoao gone, having reassembled itself and returned to the forest.

<text>In Māori mythology, Makeatutara is the father of Māui. His wife is Taranga. He is a deity and guardian of the underworld. Makeatutara made mistakes as he recited the dedicatory (or baptismal) incantations over Māui, which made it inevitable that Māui would die. As a result, humankind is mortal.

<text>In Māori mythology, Taranga is the mother of Māui. Her husband is Makeatutara. Māui was born prematurely, so Taranga wrapped his body in her hair and threw him into the waves. Some sea-creatures cared for him, hiding him in kelp until a storm sent him back to the beach. His ancestor, Tama-nui-a-rangi, found him and brought him back to life, and educated him.

Māui arrived at his mother&#x27;s village one day, and recognized his brothers. Taranga didn&#x27;t know who he was until Māui reminded her of the circumstances of his birth. Each morning, Taranga would disappear and eventually Māui followed her to the underworld by assuming the shape of a wood pigeon. Māui found her with his father, Makeatutara, a guardian of the underworld. Taranga introduced them and his father performed the dedicatory ritual over his son. Because Makeatutara made mistakes in the incantation, Māui was fated to die and thus humankind is mortal.

In some versions, Taranga is a man, the son of Murirangawhenua. He married Irawhaki, and begat the Māui brothers.

An October 2007 mākutu-lifting in the Lower Hutt suburb of Wainuiomata led to the death by drowning of a woman and the hospitalisation of a teen, allegedly due to attempts to remove such a curse.

<text>Ngā Mānawa, in a tradition of the Ngāti Awa, a Māori tribe of the eastern Bay of Plenty Region in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, was the collective name for the Fire Children, the five sons of Mahuika and Auahitūroa. The names of the Fire Children are the names of the five fingers of the human hand:

# Takonui (thumb)
# Takoroa (forefinger)
# Māpere (middle finger) 
# Mānawa (ring finger)
# Tōiti (little finger)

The names of the fire children differ in the various regions of New Zealand, simply because the name of the fingers differ. For example, to the Ngāti Kahungunu people of the East Coast of the North Island, they are:

# Konui (thumb)
# Koroa (forefinger)
# Māpere (middle finger) 
# Mānawa (ring finger)
# Kōiti (little finger)

<text>:&quot;&quot;Maohi&quot; can also refer to the indigenous people of French Polynesia, also known as Tahitians.&quot;

In Tahiti and adjacent islands, the term Maohi (&quot;Mā’ohi&quot; in Tahitian language) refers to the ancestors of the Polynesian peoples.

The term can also be a reference to normal, everyday people, just as Māori is accepted among native or indigenous people in New Zealand or the Cook Islands as the way they describe themselves. Te Ao Maohi – the Maohi world – as an expression coined by Oscar Temaru gives an example of this.

== History ==
The Ma&#x27;ohi people first arrived to what is known today as French Polynesia over 2,300 years ago. The Ma&#x27;ohi include not only Tahiti but 17 surrounding islands in French Polynesia. It wasn&#x27;t until the 18th century that external influence was introduced to the Ma&#x27;ohi people. In 1880 France seized control of Tahiti and its surrounding islands.

== La Culture Ma&#x27;ohi ==

La Culture Ma&#x27;ohi is a culture movement by the Ma&#x27;ohi people to rediscover their culture after colonization by the French in the mid-nineteenth century. Most traditions from the Ma&#x27;ohi culture were lost due to colonization, and diverse influences from neighboring islands such as the Marquesas, the Austral and the Cook Islands, helped to reconstruct post contact Tahitian culture. Reinterpretation of traditions such as art and dance as well as reconstructions of traditional Marae&#x27;s played an important role in recreating a cultural identity for Tahitians. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1950s that the reconstruction of these traditions began, due to an overall lack of knowledge about Tahitian culture. La Culture Ma&#x27;ohi is a way for Tahitian politicians to heighten the awarenesses of the cultural past as well as create and identity for the future of Tahiti.

=== Dance ===

Traditional dance was one piece of the Ma&#x27;ohi culture that was lost due to colonization by the French. Historical reenactments of the dances, the costumes and the chants had to be reconstructed due to their being no feasible way of knowing what the authentic creations were to begin with. The Heiva is a traditional annual dance event that started in the 1950s as a way to bring traditional Tahitian dance back into Tahitian culture.

=== Tattooing ===
Tattoos in Tahiti have become an accepted symbol of Ma&#x27;ohi culture. Tattoos demonstrate a commitment to Tahitian cultural identity and can be seen has decorative. Those that are young and involved in other aspects of Tahitian culture such as dance are the majority of people that have tattoos. The practice of tattooing also exists in other islands known as the Polynesian Triangle.

<text>Graham William Walker (born 4 April 1963), known professionally as Graham Norton, is an Irish comedian, broadcaster, actor, and writer. Known for his television work in the UK, Norton is a five-time BAFTA TV Award winner for the comedy chat show &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; (2007–present). He has received the British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance three times for the chat show &quot;So Graham Norton&quot; (1998–2002). He has been noted for his innuendo-laden dialogue and flamboyant presentation style.

After an early career doing stand-up comedy, Norton gained recognition for his portrayal of Father Noel Furlong in three episodes of the multiple award-winning sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot; (1996–1998). From 2010 to 2020, he presented the Saturday-morning slot on BBC Radio 2, and from 2021 to 2024, he presented his weekend show for Virgin Radio UK. Since 2009, Norton has served as the BBC&#x27;s television commentator for the Eurovision Song Contest. In 2012, he sold his production company So Television to ITV for around £17 million. In 2019, Norton became a judge on the reality competition series &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race UK&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Norton was born Graham William Walker on 4 April 1963, at 48 St Brigid&#x27;s Road, in Clondalkin, County Dublin, Ireland, to William &quot;Billy&quot; (died 2000), a sales representative for Guinness, and Rhoda Walker. He has an older sister, Paula (born 1959). Because of his father&#x27;s job, he and his family moved around Ireland throughout his early childhood; they lived in Tramore, then Waterford, then Kilkenny, before settling in the town of Bandon, County Cork, where he grew up. He was raised in a Church of Ireland family, and has said that he felt somewhat isolated growing up as a Protestant in the predominantly Catholic south of Ireland. His father&#x27;s family were from County Wicklow, while his mother is a native of Belfast. He discovered during a 2007 episode of the genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; that his father&#x27;s direct ancestors were English, having originated in Yorkshire before emigrating to Ireland in 1713.

Norton was educated at Bandon Grammar School in County Cork and then University College Cork, where he spent two years studying English and French in the 1980s. He did not complete his studies after having a breakdown and refusing to leave his flat. He later received an honorary doctorate from the university in 2013.

In 1981, Norton featured in an episode of RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Youngline&quot;, participating in an audience debate about underage teens attending discos. In 1983, Norton travelled to San Francisco where he lived for one year, in the &quot;Stardance&quot; hippie commune house,&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/2007/11/18/bbc.television&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcamerica/1013084&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mamamia/graham-norton&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebar/222970&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; on Fulton Street and worked as a waiter.&lt;ref name=&quot;tv.apple/graham-norton&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s he moved to London to attend the Central School of Speech and Drama. He again found work as a waiter during that period. Upon joining the actors&#x27; union Equity, he chose Norton (his great-grandmother&#x27;s maiden name) as his new surname, as there was already a comic-actor called Graham Walker, represented by the union.

==Career==
===Channel 4===
In 1992, Norton&#x27;s stand-up comedy drag act as a tea-towel-clad Mother Teresa of Calcutta in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe made the press when Scottish Television&#x27;s religious affairs department mistakenly thought he represented the real Mother Teresa. His first appearances in broadcasting were in the UK, where he had a spot as a regular comedian and panellist on the BBC Radio 4 show &quot;Loose Ends&quot; in the early 1990s, when the show ran on Saturday mornings.

He was one of the early successes of Channel 5, winning an award as stand-in host of a late-night TV talk show usually presented by Jack Docherty. This was followed by a comic quiz show on Channel 5 called &quot;Bring Me the Head of Light Entertainment&quot;, which was not well received as a programme but enhanced Norton&#x27;s reputation as a comic and host. In 1996, he co-hosted the late-night quiz show &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; on ITV with Maria McErlane.

Between 1996 and 1998, Norton played the part of Father Noel Furlong in three episodes (&quot;Hell&quot;, &quot;Flight into Terror&quot;, &quot;The Mainland&quot;) of the Channel 4 series &quot;Father Ted&quot;, which was set on the fictional Craggy Island off the west coast of Ireland. Father Furlong was often seen taking charge of the St Luke&#x27;s Youth Group.

After this early success, Norton moved to Channel 4 in 1998 to host his own chat shows, including the weekly &quot;So Graham Norton&quot; (1998–2002), followed by the daily weeknight show &quot;V Graham Norton&quot; (2002–03). In January 2003 Norton was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 1,000 funniest acts in British comedy. (Though Norton is Irish, the bulk of his television career has been in the UK.) In January 2004, he was named the most powerful person in TV comedy by &quot;Radio Times&quot;.

Also that year he was the subject of controversy in the United Kingdom when, on his Channel 4 show, he joked, &quot;I bet Maurice Gibb&#x27;s heart monitor was singing the tune of &#x27;Stayin&#x27; Alive&#x27;&quot;, referring to the recent death of the Bee Gees singer. Gibb&#x27;s brother Robin described Norton as &quot;scum&quot;, threatened to &quot;rip his head off&quot; if he saw him, and demanded an apology from him, the show&#x27;s producers, and Channel 4. The Independent Television Commission investigated after complaints about this insensitivity were received and eventually Channel 4 had to make two apologies: one in the form of a caption slide before the show, another from Norton in person.

In the summer of 2004, Norton ventured into American television. &quot;The Graham Norton Effect&quot; debuted on 24 June 2004, on Comedy Central, and was also broadcast in the UK on BBC Three. In the midst of controversy surrounding Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson&#x27;s Super Bowl performance, Norton was wary of moving into the market.

===BBC===
====Television====

Norton began his career on the BBC in 2001 when he hosted Comic Relief 2001.

In 2005, Norton moved to the BBC and began hosting the Saturday evening reality TV series &quot;Strictly Dance Fever&quot; on BBC One, as well as a new comedy chat show, &quot;Graham Norton&#x27;s Bigger Picture&quot;. He also read stories some nights on the BBC children&#x27;s channel CBeebies as part of &quot;Bedtime Hour&quot;.

In 2006, Norton hosted the BBC One series &quot;How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?&quot; in which Andrew Lloyd Webber tried to find a lead actress for his West End version of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Norton has subsequently presented the three follow-up series: &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; in 2007, in which a group of males competed to win the role of Joseph in the West End production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot; in 2008, in which Lloyd Webber seeks to find the parts of Nancy and Oliver for Sir Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s production of Lionel Bart&#x27;s &quot;Oliver!&quot;; and &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; in 2010, following a similar format to find a new Dorothy for a &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; West end Production.

Norton hosted various other shows for the BBC during this time, including &quot;When Will I Be Famous?&quot; (2007), &quot;The One and Only&quot; (2008) and &quot;Totally Saturday&quot; (2009). Since 2007, Norton has also been a regular host of The British Academy Television Awards. On 7 July 2007, Norton presented at Live Earth and undertook a trip to Ethiopia with the Born Free Foundation to highlight the plight of the Ethiopian wolf – the rarest canid in the world. In the same year, he was the subject of an episode of the BBC1 genealogy documentary &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;

Norton&#x27;s chat show, &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;, began on 22 February 2007, on BBC Two. The format is very similar to his previous Channel 4 shows. On 6 October 2009, the show moved to BBC One, in a new one-hour format.

In May 2010, Norton stood in for Chris Evans&#x27; breakfast show on BBC Radio 2. Later that month, it was confirmed that he would be replacing Jonathan Ross&#x27;s Saturday morning slot on the same station.

In December 2011, the panel show &quot;Would You Rather...? with Graham Norton&quot; premiered on BBC America in the time slot immediately following &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;. Recorded in New York, it is one of BBC America&#x27;s earliest efforts at producing original programming, and is also the first panel game the channel has shown, either of British or American origin.

In October 2018, talking to BBC News about his reported 2017–18 BBC salary, Norton said that he genuinely &quot;doesn&#x27;t know&quot; how the corporation arrived at that figure. &quot;Myself and my agent look at that number and we go &#x27;I wonder how they came up with that&#x27;,&quot; he says. &quot;It bears no relation to anything I know. But if that&#x27;s what they say I earn, that&#x27;s what I earn.&quot;

In February 2019, it was announced that Norton would be a judge on &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race UK&quot; alongside Alan Carr in a rotating basis. Norton and Carr were joined by permanent judges Michelle Visage and RuPaul.

====Radio====
Since 1999, Norton has appeared regularly on the BBC Radio 4 panel show &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, appearing in over 100 episodes.

On 2 October 2010, Norton began presenting a Saturday morning show on BBC Radio 2, which he took over from Jonathan Ross. Norton co-hosted with Maria McErlane who featured as an &quot;agony aunt&quot; on the segment &quot;Grill Graham&quot;. &quot;Tune with a Tale&quot; is where a listener suggests playing a song with a plot, summarising the story it contains, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Better&quot; is a feature where a listener requests a song that was previously a hit, but might be considered particularly bad now. Unlike &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot; aired from 14:00 to 17:00 on weekdays, it is well established as being a &quot;brand&quot;, with its end of each hour style of presentations, although Norton regularly uses the standard BBC Radio 2 jingles along with jingles unique to the Saturday morning show, written and performed by the BBC Radio 2 Orchestra.

In January 2012, Norton asked listeners to his Radio 2 show to help find his car, shortly after it was stolen. He called it &quot;The Great Car Hunt&quot; and told listeners to
&quot;Keep your eyes out for it. It was filthy by the way.&quot;

On 11 November 2020, Norton announced that he would step down from the show and hosted his final Saturday morning show on 19 December 2020, after 10 years. He was replaced by Claudia Winkleman from February 2021.

Norton joined Virgin Radio UK in January 2021, hosting shows on Saturday and Sunday. In February 2024, Norton announced that &quot;he wanted his weekends back&quot; and would step away from hosting his weekend radio show for the station.

====Eurovision Song Contest====

Norton, along with Claudia Winkleman, hosted the first annual Eurovision Dance Contest, which was held on 1 September 2007, in London, England. The format was based on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and the EBU&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest. Norton and Winkleman also hosted the 2008 contest in Glasgow, Scotland.

In October 2008, it was confirmed by the BBC that Norton would replace Terry Wogan as the presenter of the UK national selection of the Eurovision Song Contest, &quot;Your Country Needs You&quot;.

On 5 December 2008, it was announced that Norton would also take over from Wogan as the British commentator for the main Eurovision Song Contest. The 54th Eurovision Song Contest was held in the Olympic Arena, Moscow on 16 May 2009.

In January 2009, Norton hosted &quot;&quot;, a talent show to find who would represent the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest that year. The winning song, It&#x27;s My Time, was penned by Diane Warren and Andrew Lloyd Webber and was sung in the contest by Jade Ewen, who the public voted to represent the United Kingdom.

Norton&#x27;s debut jokes received some positive reviews from the British press. &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted his comments on Iceland&#x27;s entry, which finished in second place, had &quot;rooted around in a cupboard and found an old bridesmaid dress from 1987&quot; and the Armenian singers, who finished in 10th place, were sporting traditional dress, &quot;which would be true if you come from the village where Liberace is the mayor.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; noted his highlighting of the arrest of 30 gay rights protesters in Moscow – &quot;heavy-handed policing has really marred what has been a fantastic Eurovision.&quot;

In 2015, Norton, along with Petra Mede, hosted the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; concert show on 31 March at the Eventim Apollo, in Hammersmith, London to commemorate the contest&#x27;s 60th anniversary.

Norton played a fictionalised version of himself in his role of the British Eurovision commentator in the 2020 Netflix film &quot;Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga&quot;.

Norton co-hosted the final of the in Liverpool alongside Alesha Dixon, actress Hannah Waddingham and Ukrainian singer Julia Sanina, in addition to his usual commentary role which was shared with Mel Giedroyc. With this, he also became the second-oldest person to ever host the Eurovision Song Contest, after the French presenter Léon Zitrone in 1978.

=== ITV ===
In 2024, Norton returned to ITV to present a revival of Wheel of Fortune, including the celebrity version, featuring Gok Wan and Charlotte Church.

Norton wrote an advice column in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper from 2006 to 2018. In October 2010, his columns were made into a book entitled &quot;Ask Graham&quot;, published by John Blake Publishing. In late 2018, Norton stood down from the role and the newspaper found a replacement as their agony aunt in Richard Madeley.

In 2016, Norton published his debut novel &quot;Holding&quot;, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, about a murder in an Irish rural community. &quot;Holding&quot; won Popular Fiction Book of the Year in the Bord Gais Energy Irish Book Awards 2016. In 2022, an adaptation of the book for television, directed by Kathy Burke, aired on ITV.

On 7 March 2013, Norton broke the Guinness World Record for &quot;Most Questions Asked on a TV Chat Show&quot; on &quot;Comic Relief&#x27;s Big Chat&quot;, which raised £1.02 million.

In 2014, Norton criticised the decision by Irish broadcaster RTÉ to settle out of court with opponents of gay marriage who claimed they had been defamed in an edition of the &quot;Saturday Night Show&quot;.

In 2014, Norton publicly backed &quot;Hacked Off&quot; and its campaign toward UK press self-regulation by &quot;safeguarding the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable&quot;.

In October 2014, Norton released his second memoir, &quot;The Life and Loves of a He-Devil&quot;. It won in the Non-Fiction Book of the Year category at the 2014 Irish Book Awards. Also in 2014, he was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.

On 9 October 2020, Norton announced via Twitter he had been cast as the voice of Moonwind, a spiritual sign twirler, in the Disney/Pixar animated feature &quot;Soul&quot;, starring Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey.

==Personal life==
Norton primarily resides in the Wapping area of London. He also owns homes in Manhattan, on the Sussex coast and in County Cork, where he was raised.

In 1989, Norton was a victim of a violent mugging by a group of attackers in London where he lost half of his blood and nearly died. He said that an elderly couple were the ones who found him and that they &quot;saved his life&quot; after calling for an ambulance. He did not think the attack was homophobic, as he was walking alone at the time. He was hospitalised for two and a half weeks before recovering from the attack.

In January 2012, Norton&#x27;s home was burgled and the keys to his Lexus were stolen. He appealed for the return of his car during his BBC Radio 2 show the following day.

He adopted two dogs from the UK charity Dogs Trust in 2012 which he regarded as his &quot;significant others&quot;, a labradoodle called Bailey and a terrier called Madge. Madge was at least 16 years old when she died in December 2019. In October 2020, he said that Bailey had recently died in Cork at the age of 15.

Norton had a 5-year on-again, off-again relationship with Kristian Seeber, whom he met at Barracuda Lounge in New York City in 2001. Seeber performs as drag queen, Tina Burner, and moved to the United Kingdom to be with Norton, until their separation in 2006. Norton had a two-year relationship with Trevor Patterson which ended in 2013, and a three-year relationship with Andrew Smith, which ended in 2015.

On 10 July 2022, Norton married Scottish filmmaker Jonathan &quot;Jono&quot; McLeod, at Bantry House in County Cork.

In October 2022, Norton was involved in controversy over comments he made in an interview with Mariella Frostrup at the Cheltenham Literature Festival. He expressed scepticism over the existence of cancel culture, arguing that &quot;I think the word should be &#x27;accountability&#x27;.&quot; When Frostrup countered that J. K. Rowling had been &quot;deluged with... anger, rage and attempts at censorship&quot; over her views on transgender rights, Norton responded that it would be better to &quot;talk to trans people, talk to the parents of trans kids, talk to doctors&quot; about the issue than to celebrities like himself. Rowling criticised Norton&#x27;s comments on Twitter, citing him as part of a &quot;recent spate of bearded men stepping confidently onto their soapboxes to define what a woman is and throw their support behind rape and death threats to those who dare disagree&quot;. Following further criticism on Twitter from supporters of Rowling, Norton deactivated his Twitter account.

<text>The are traditional winter hunters of the Tōhoku region of northern Japan, most famously today in the Ani area in Akita Prefecture, which is known for the Akita dogs. Afterwards, they spread to the Shirakami-Sanchi forest between Akita and Aomori, and other areas of Japan. Documented as a specialised group from the medieval period onwards, the Matagi continue to hunt deer and bear in the present day, and their culture has much in common with the bear worship of the Ainu people.

With the introduction of modern firearms in the 19th century, and mass-production of reloadable cartridges beginning with the Murata rifle, the need for group hunting for bear has diminished, leading to a decline in Matagi culture.

Matagi hamlets are found in the districts of Nishitsugaru and Nakatsugaru (Aomori Prefecture), Kitaakita and Senboku (Akita Prefecture), Waga (Iwate Prefecture), Nishiokitama and Tsuruoka (Yamagata Prefecture), Murakami and Nakauonuma (Niigata Prefecture and Nagano Prefecture). Well-known Matagi villages frequented by tourists can be found in Ani on the western slopes of Mount Moriyoshi in Akita Prefecture, and a few hamlets on the eastern slopes of Mount Chōkai in Akita and Yamagata prefectures.

== Etymology and language ==

There are multiple theories on the origins of the word Matagi. One notable theory is that it is derived from the Touhoku word . It is also hypothesised that the word &quot;matagi&quot; originates in the Ainu language, from or , meaning &quot;man of winter&quot; or &quot;hunter&quot;. The latter theory is also supported by the existence of specialised hunting vocabulary in the Matagi dialect which contains a number of Ainu language words.

== Ethnic origin ==
According to Lee and Hasegawa, the Matagi are the historical descendants of Ainu-speaking hunters and fishermen who migrated down from Hokkaido into parts of Honshu. They also contributed several Ainu-derived toponyms and loanwords, related to geography and certain forest and water animals which they hunted, to the local Japonic-speaking people.

== Hunting practices ==
=== Spirituality ===

The Matagi have a unique culture that centers around their belief in mountain gods and distinct law. For them, hunting is a way of life, and not a form of sport. The animals hunted are perceived as gifts from the mountain gods, and the Matagi have a certain way to butcher and prepare the animal. After the animal is killed, it is praised, and the spirit comforted. Then, to recompense for the loss of life, everything, from the fur to the internal organs, is used. Emphasis is put on the act of taking an animal&#x27;s life through ceremony and reflection, which is then passed along to future generations of Matagi.

=== Present-day Matagi ===
The Matagi live in small hamlets of the mountain beech forests of Tōhoku and engage in agriculture during the planting and harvest season. In the winter and early spring, they form hunting bands that spend weeks at a time in the forest.

In the modern day, some Matagi have come into conflict with environmental activists, due to concerns over deforestation and the depletion of certain animal species. The Matagi no longer hunt the Japanese serow, which is protected, but continue to hunt bear by special license.

== Literary references ==

Matagi are referenced and described in the biographical novel &quot;Dog Man: An Uncommon Life on a Faraway Mountain&quot; by Martha Sherrill, alongside descriptions of a real modern day Matagi named Uesugi, who was a friend of the main characters who helped preserve the Akita breed of dog, which they used extensively for hunting.

Matagi figure as primary characters in the novel, &quot;The Girl with the Face of the Moon&quot; by Ellis Amdur.
In the manga series &quot;Golden Kamuy&quot; a Matagi hunter named Tanigaki Genjirou is prominently featured, as well as Ainu culture in general. &quot;My Deer Friend Nokotan&quot; also features a Matagi character named &quot;Souichirou Kumatori&quot; who attempts to hunt the main character, a deer, for a procession of a local festival in his hometown in Hokkaido.

The main character, Hitomi, of the comic book series with the same name by HS Take and Isabella Mazantini is said to be a Matagi.

<text>In Māori culture, Matariki is the Pleiades star cluster and a celebration of its first rising in late June or early July. The rising marks the beginning of the new year in the Māori lunar calendar. 

Historically, Matariki was usually celebrated for a period of days during the last quarter of the moon of the lunar month Pipiri (around June). The ceremony involved viewing the individual stars for forecasts of the year to come, mourning the deceased of the past year, and making an offering of food to replenish the stars. Some Māori use the rise of Puanga (Rigel) or other stars to mark the new year. 

Celebration of Matariki declined during the 20th century, but beginning in the early 1990s it underwent a revival. Matariki was first celebrated as an official public holiday in New Zealand on 24 June 2022.

== Name and meaning ==
Matariki is the Māori name for the cluster of stars known to Western astronomers as the Pleiades in the constellation Taurus. is a shortened version of , &quot;the eyes of the god Tāwhirimātea&quot;. According to Māori tradition, Tāwhirimātea, the god of wind and weather, was enraged by the separation of heaven and earth – his parents, Ranginui and Papatūānuku. Defeated in battle by his brother, Tāwhirimātea fled to the sky to live with Ranginui, but in his anger he first plucked out his eyes as a gesture of contempt towards his siblings, and flung them into the sky, where they remain, stuck to his father&#x27;s chest. In Māori tradition the unpredictability of the winds is blamed on Tāwhirimātea&#x27;s blindness.

The word is the name of both the star cluster and one of the stars within it. Other terms for the cluster as a whole include (&quot;Matariki fixed in the heavens&quot;) and (&quot;the assembly of Matariki&quot;).

Matariki is sometimes incorrectly translated as (&quot;little eyes&quot;), a mistake originating in the work of Elsdon Best and continued by others.

=== In other Polynesian cultures ===
The word &quot;matariki&quot; or similar, referring to the Pleiades, is found in many Polynesian languages. In the Marquesas the star cluster is known as or , in the Cooks as , and in the Tuamotu archipelago as . In some languages it has Best&#x27;s meaning of &#x27;little eyes&#x27;, but in most it is a contraction of , meaning &#x27;eyes of the god&#x27; or &#x27;eyes of the chief&#x27;. In Hawaii, the rising of in November ushers in the four-month season Makahiki, which honours Lono, the god of agriculture and fertility. In Tahiti, the year was divided into two seasons, named according to whether the Pleiades are visible after sunset: (&#x27; above&#x27;) and (&#x27; below&#x27;). On Rapa Nui, Matariki heralded the New Year, and its disappearance in mid-April ended the fishing season.

==The nine stars==

To the ancient Greeks, the Pleiades contained nine stars: the parents Atlas and Pleione, positioned to one side of the cluster, and their seven daughters Alcyone, Maia, Taygeta, Electra, Merope, Celaeno and Sterope.

Many Māori sources, especially older ones, list seven stars in Matariki: Matariki herself, the central star in the cluster (the or &#x27;conductor&#x27;), and six children. The emblem of the Kīngitanga or Māori King movement, Te Paki o Matariki, includes the star Matariki flanked by three stars on each side. The six other stars are sometimes named as Matariki&#x27;s daughters; it has been suggested that the idea of Matariki as a group of seven female stars was influenced by the concept of the Pleiades&#x27; &quot;seven sisters&quot;.

The manuscript of Rāwiri Te Kōkau passed on to Rangi Mātāmua recognised nine stars in Matariki, adding Pōhutukawa and Hiwa-i-te-Rangi (also known just as Hiwa) to make a total of eight children, five of which were female and three male. The father of Matariki&#x27;s children was Rehua, paramount chief of the heavens, identified by Māori as the star Antares.

The stars of Matariki and their genders as recorded by Te Kōkau are identified with particular traits and areas of influence, also reflected in their positions in the star cluster:
The star Pōhutukawa&#x27;s association with the departed relates to the lone pōhutukawa tree at Te Rerenga Wairua (Cape Reinga), the departing place for the spirits of the deceased as they return to the ancestral homeland of Hawaiki. Mourning the deceased is one component of the Matariki celebration.

Hiwa-i-te-rangi, also known just as Hiwa, is the youngest of Matariki&#x27;s children and was considered the &quot;wishing star&quot;: Māori would rest their hopes and desires on Hiwa, similar to &quot;wishing upon a star&quot;, and if it appeared to shine bright and clear on the first viewing of Matariki those individual and collective wishes were likely to be answered.

== Māori New Year ==

Traditional Māori culture was interwoven with astronomical knowledge, with constellations and the lunar cycle used for navigation, planting and harvesting, delineating the seasons, and marking the spawning and migration of fish. This knowledge was passed down by oral tradition, and different regions and iwi recorded different dates, significant constellations, and traditional calendars or .

The Pleiades constellation (Matariki) is visible for most of the year in New Zealand, except for approximately a month in the middle of winter. Matariki finally sets in the west in the early evening in May, and reappears just prior to sunrise in late June or early July, which begins the first month of the Māori lunar calendar, Pipiri (meaning to huddle together). All the months of the Māori calendar are indicated by this heliacal rising of a particular star on the eastern horizon just before dawn, on the night of the new moon: for example, the tenth month, Poutūterangi, is signalled by the heliacal rising of Altair. Matariki&#x27;s role in signalling the start of the year means it is known as (&quot;the star of the year&quot;).

The time in midsummer when Matariki is overhead in the night sky is referred to as , i.e. the calm weather of summer – a phrase meaning good weather and good fortune. In Māori historical recollection, the Tainui canoe was instructed to leave the homeland of Hawaiki for Aotearoa in summer, when Matariki was overhead: this being a direct, ancient historical reference to Māori use of star navigation, for long sea voyaging. Because of these associations with peace and calm, the second Māori king, Matutaera Tāwhiao, chose Matariki as an emblem, and the Kīngitanga newspaper was named . 

Most celebration of Matariki begins in the last quarter phase of the moon after the constellation&#x27;s first appearance, during 3–4 nights known as &quot;the nights of Tangaroa&quot; (), and finishes on the night before the new moon. The new moon, or , is considered inauspicious in the Māori calendar, so would spoil any celebrations. Because Māori traditionally use a 354-day lunar calendar with 29.5 days to the month, rather than the 365-day Gregorian solar calendar, the dates of Matariki vary each year. Māori did not use a single unified lunar calendar, and different iwi might recognise different numbers of months, give them different names, or start the month on the full moon rather than the new moon.

=== Puanga and Matariki ===
There has also always been regional variation across Aotearoa, in which stars signal the start of the New Year, and what date is chosen to celebrate it. Some iwi (tribes) – specifically those in the far north of Te Ika-a-Māui (the North Island), the mid-western parts of Te Ika-a-Māui around Taranaki, the Chatham Islands, and much of Te Waipounamu (South Island) – celebrate Puanga, using the rising of the brighter star Rigel (&quot;Puanga&quot; in northern Māori, &quot;Puaka&quot; in southern Māori) as the marker of the New Year, instead of Matariki. This is sometimes attributed to Puanga being more visible or visible earlier than Matariki, but, as Rangi Mātāmua puts it, &quot;the variation in the rising between Matariki and Puanga is very small, and if the Tangaroa nights of Piripi are observed correctly, then both stars will be seen in the morning sky.&quot; It has been suggested that that tradition of Puaka belonged to the first Polynesian settlers to arrive in Aotearoa, and Matariki was brought by a second wave of arrivals, who also brought the first kūmara (with which Matariki is associated).

In Māori tradition the stars Puanga and Matariki were rivals, with Puanga beautifying herself every winter, attempting to be the star beside which the sun rises and signals the New Year, but being eternally frustrated when each year the Sun rose beside Matariki.

Other iwi use Atutahi (Canopus) rather than Puanga, or the setting of Rehua (Antares) in winter, to mark the New Year.

== Traditional celebration ==
Matariki was an occasion to mourn the deceased, celebrate the present, and prepare the ground for the coming year. The ceremony had three parts: viewing the stars, remembering the deceased, and making an offering of food to the stars. This time of the year was also a good time to instruct young people in the lore of the land and the forest. In addition, certain birds and fish were associated with Matariki: to Tūhoe it marked the beginning of the season where kererū or native pigeon could be captured, cooked, and preserved in its own fat, and the rise of Matariki corresponded with the return of korokoro (lampreys) from the sea to spawn in rivers. 
=== Viewing ===
Because of the frequent poor weather in winter, the viewing of Matariki was spread across the three or four nights of Tangaroa to increase the chance that the stars would be clearly seen. The first clear night marked the beginning of festivities. When Matariki reappeared, Māori would look to its stars for a forecast of the coming season&#x27;s prosperity: if they shone clear and bright, the remaining winter would be warm, but hazy or twinkling stars predicted bad weather in the season ahead. The colour, brightness, and distinctiveness of each star in Matariki would be assessed, and forecasts made according to each of their associations: for example, if Tupu-ā-rangi did not shine clearly then hunters would expect a poor catch of birds in the coming season. Pōhutukawa was linked to the deceased, so its brightness would signal how many people were likely to pass away in the coming year. These predictions were made by tohunga kōkōrangi, learned elders who had studied and debated for many years in a whare kōkōrangi (house of astronomical learning).

=== Remembering the deceased ===
After the forecasts for the year had been read from the stars, the deceased were invoked with tears and song in a ceremony called (&quot;the reciting of laments&quot;). The names of everyone who had died since Matariki&#x27;s last rising were recited. Traditionally, Māori believed that the spirits of the dead were collected during the year and at the setting of Matariki in the month of Hautara they were led into the afterlife. On the rising of Matariki at the start of the year, the deceased of the past year were carried up from the underworld and cast up into the night sky to become stars, accompanied by prayers and the recitation of their names. Beginning the mourning for the previous year&#x27;s departed at Matariki is still reflected in modern Māori mourning practices.

=== Offering of food ===
An important part of the celebration was , a ceremonial offering of food to the stars. The reasoning was that Matariki, after shepherding the spirits of the dead up from the underworld and turning the sun back from the winter solstice, would be weak and in need of sustenance. A small hāngī or earth oven was built, with heated stones in a pit on which was placed food, a layer of leaves, and earth. The uncovering of the cooked food released steam which rose into the sky and fed the stars, the steam being the or sacred offering. The food was chosen to correspond with the domains of the stars in Matariki: these might include kūmara for Tupuānuku, a bird for Tupuārangi, freshwater fish for Waitī, and shellfish for Waitā. The offering of food was the final part of the ceremony, which ended at sunrise.

The Matariki ceremony was followed by days of festivities – song, dance, and feasting – known as (&quot;the first fruits of the year&quot;), celebrating prosperity, life, and the promise of the year to come.

== Modern observance ==
With the colonisation of New Zealand by Pākehā settlers in the 19th century, many traditional Māori practices began to decline. Some aspects of Matariki were incorporated into new religious traditions such as the Ringatū church, but its traditional celebration had almost ceased by the early 20th century. The last of the traditional Matariki celebrations were recorded in the 1940s. Dansey records the ceremony being still practised in the 1880s or 1890s, and gives an account of one elderly New Plymouth woman carrying on the custom on her own until her death in 1941.

The revival of the celebration of Matariki can be traced to the early 1990s, sparked by various Māori iwi and organisations such as the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, for example in 1995 there was a festival called &quot;Pipitea Marae: Te Whakanui i a Matariki,&quot; at Pipitea Marae, Wellington City supported by Te Awa Kairangi Community Arts, Te Atiawa FM, Ernst &amp; Young and Te Taura Whiri.

Te Rangi Huata of Ngāti Kahungunu began in 2000 an annual Matariki celebration in Hastings, which attracted 500 people, which reached 15,000 in 2001. In 2001, the Māori Language Commission began a move to &quot;reclaim Matariki, or Aotearoa Pacific New Year, as an important focus for Māori language regeneration&quot;. In 2016 Te Wānanga o Aotearoa promoted a new vision of Matariki in a month-long roadshow called &quot;Te Iwa o Matariki&quot; ( being Māori for &quot;nine&quot;), stressing the nine stars recognised by some iwi.

Since then it has increasingly become common practice for people – Māori and non-Māori – and institutions such as schools, libraries, and city councils to celebrate Matariki in a range of ways. These have included concerts, festivals of lights, the illumination of Auckland&#x27;s Sky Tower, and tree planting. In 2017 Wellington City Council announced they would cancel the Sky Show fireworks held on Guy Fawkes Night for 22 years, and move them to a Matariki cultural festival from July 2018.

The celebrations have taken place over the period of a week or month, anywhere from early June to late August, but increasingly coincide with the winter solstice or the traditional dates of Matariki.

In 2024, Charles III, as King of New Zealand, released a message recognising the holiday in both English and Māori. Earlier on 30 April, President of French Polynesia Moetai Brotherson in a session with his Council of Ministers agreed to make their local counterpart as an official public holiday on November 20th in place of Internal Autonomy Day on June 29th inspired by the success of the celebrations in Aotearoa following a proposal by its Minister of Culture Eliane Tevahitua; the act would be implemented officially on 2025.

===Public holiday===

A proposal to make Matariki an official public holiday in New Zealand was made by former Māori Party MP Rahui Katene&#x27;s member&#x27;s bill &quot; Bill/Matariki Day Bill&quot;, drawn from the ballot in June 2009. The Bill would have fixed the date of a public holiday using the new moon in June; this was later changed to the new moon of the heliacal rising of Matariki when the bill was drawn a month later and set down for introduction into Parliament. Mayor of Waitakere City Bob Harvey supported the call to make Matariki a public holiday to replace Queen&#x27;s Birthday, along with the Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand, which found none of New Zealand&#x27;s local authorities held celebrations for Queen&#x27;s Birthday but many celebrated Matariki. However, the Bill itself did not propose abolishing Queen&#x27;s Birthday, and was voted down at its first reading.

As part of the National–Māori Party agreement subsequent to the 2011 New Zealand general election, both parties agreed to support a &quot;cultural heritage bill to recognise Matariki/Puanga, and to honour the peace-making heritage established at Parihaka.&quot;

In July 2020, Laura O&#x27;Connell Rapira delivered two combined petitions calling for Matariki to be made a public holiday that were signed by 30,000 people. 

On 7 September 2020, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern pledged to make Matariki a public holiday if the Labour Party were re-elected in the 2020 general election. The proposed public holiday would not be implemented until 2022, during which businesses could recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. On 4 February 2021, Ardern announced the first date for the public holiday as 24 June 2022. Legislation to give this legal effect would be introduced during the 2021 parliamentary session.

On 2 July 2021, the day the constellation rose, Ardern announced the proposed dates of the holiday for the next 30 years, as determined by a Matariki Advisory Group drawn from iwi across the country. The date of the holiday was formalised as the Friday closest to the 4 days of the nights of Tangaroa in the lunar month Piripi. The dates vary from late June to mid July, but are always on a Friday, to encourage people to travel and spend time with their families, and to give an extra public holiday to people who usually miss out on Mondayised public holidays (e.g. those who normally work Tuesday to Saturday). The date of Matariki varies because the 354-day Māori lunar calendar (with occasional intercalary months) only approximates the 365.24 day solar Gregorian solar calendar.

On 30 September 2021, Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Kiri Allan introduced the Te Kāhui o Matariki Public Holiday Bill to make Matariki a public holiday. The bill passed its first reading supported by the Labour, Green and Māori parties, but opposed by National and ACT. National argued that Matariki should replace an existing public holiday instead of being added as a new holiday, to lessen the impact on businesses which is estimated to be NZ$448 million annually. The bill passed its second reading on 29 March 2022. During the debate, the National and ACT parties expressed concerns about creating a 12th public holiday; claiming that it would cost NZ$450 million and have a negative impact on businesses. The Labour, Green and Māori parties argued that the bill would establish a new Māori public holiday in the calendar and raise awareness of Māori indigenous knowledge.

The bill passed its third reading on 7 April. During the final debate, National MP Paul Goldsmith argued that Matariki should replace a previous public holiday while ACT&#x27;s Small Business spokesperson Chris Baillie claimed that having a new public holiday would cost businesses NZ$453 million. The Bill&#x27;s sponsor Kiritapu Allan defended Matariki, arguing that public holidays reduced employee burnout and stress while boosting hospitality and tourism. National MP Simon O&#x27;Connor suggested naming the bill a &quot;neutral&quot; name such as Pleiades, which prompted Crown-Māori Relations Minister Kelvin Davis to claim that the former&#x27;s remarks showed National&#x27;s contempt for Māori culture. The bill received royal assent on 11 April 2022.

Matariki was first observed as a public holiday on 24 June 2022, including a pre-dawn live broadcast of a hautapu ceremony. It was received positively overall by New Zealanders. Its significance to New Zealanders is also enhanced by being exclusive to New Zealand culture.

For businesses, Matariki is treated identically to most other public holidays; employees working on Matariki are required to be paid time-and-a-half and there are no restrictions on shops opening or alcohol sales. However, due to the unique cultural significance of the holiday, Māori cultural advisers and academics have warned companies against commercialising Matariki, citing cultural disrespect. Due to its proximity between King&#x27;s Birthday and Labour Day, concerns were made regarding overcommercialisation of Matariki in terms of appropriating the extended public holiday as an opportunity for shopping events, such as the sale of fireworks. There are concerns regarding the impact of commercialisation on Matariki in the future, potentially associating the holiday with binge-drinking instead of time with whānau (family) as intended.

<text>In Māori mythology, Matuku-tangotango (Matuku) is an ogre who kills Wahieroa the son of Tāwhaki. In some versions, Matuku lives in a cave called Putawarenuku. Rātā, the son of Wahieroa, sets off to avenge his murdered father, and arrives at last at Matuku&#x27;s village. He hears from Matuku&#x27;s servant that at the new moon his master can be killed at the pool where he washes his face and hair. When the new moon has come, Rātā waits until the ogre comes out of his cave and is leaning over with his head in the pool. He grabs him by the hair and kills him. Rātā then sets off to rescue his father&#x27;s bones from the Ponaturi. A South Island version names the islands where Matuku lives as Puorunuku and Puororangi and also states that Rātā nooses Matuku as he comes out of his lair to perform certain rituals (Tregear 1891:232, 399-400).

*Matuku-tangotango (&#x27;tangotango&#x27; perhaps means &#x27;dark as night&#x27;, or &#x27;ominous&#x27;)

<text>In Māori mythology, Wahieroa is a son of Tāwhaki, and father of Rātā.

Tāwhaki was attacked and left for dead by two of his brothers-in-law, jealous that their wives preferred the handsome Tāwhaki to them. He was nursed back to health by his wife Hinepiripiri. She helped him back to their house, and brought home a long piece of timber for the fire, to keep him warm. Shortly afterwards, a son was born to them, and named Wahieroa. The name, meaning &#x27;long piece of firewood&#x27;, was chosen to fix in their son&#x27;s mind the wrong that had been done to Tāwhaki, in order that one day Wahieroa might avenge him.

In another version, Tāwhaki told his people to collect firewood, and went himself to gather some. The others were lazy, and brought back little wood, but Tāwhaki returned with a long piece of timber on his shoulder. When he saw what the others had brought, he threw it down, and the noise startled them. Tāwhaki told his wife to call their child Wahieroa when it was born, to remind them of the incident. The child was raised with care, and when he grew to adulthood he married Tonga-rau-tāwhiri When she was pregnant, she had a craving to eat the flesh of a tūī bird, and asked Wahieroa to catch one. Wahieroa did so. It was cooked and she ate it with relish. Some time later she asked him to bring her another. Wahieroa went into the forest with his slave, but could not find any tūī. The two men went further and further into the forest, until they came to the hunting grounds of Matuku-tangotango, who killed Wahieroa and captured his slave. Shortly after Wahieroa had been killed, Matoka-rau-tawhiri gave birth to a son, named Rātā, who would one day avenge the death of Wahieroa.

<text>Motoro is a god in Polynesian mythology, the tribal god of the Ngariki of Mangaia. He is the son of Tangiia and the brother of Ruanuku, Kereteki and Utakea. While travelling to Mangaia he argued with his two eldest brothers, was thrown into the sea, and devoured by sharks. His spirit then floated to Mangaia on a piece of hibiscus. He was known as &quot;i&#x27;o ora&quot; (&quot;god of the living&quot;) because his followers could not be used as human sacrifices.

Moko is a ruler or king of the lizards, and he orders his lizard subjects to climb into the basket of the sky demon Amai-te-rangi to spy on him. When Amai-te-rangi pulls up his basket, he is disappointed to find it full of miserable little reptiles, which escape and overrun his home in the sky.

<text>Matthew Wayne Shepard (December 1, 1976 – October 12, 1998) was an American student at the University of Wyoming who was beaten, tortured, and left to die near Laramie on October 6, 1998. He was transported by rescuers to Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colorado, where he died six days later from severe head injuries sustained during the attack.

Suspects Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson were arrested shortly after the attack and charged with first-degree murder following Shepard&#x27;s death. Significant media coverage was given to the murder and what role Shepard&#x27;s sexual orientation played as a motive for the crime, as he was gay.

The prosecutor argued the murder of Shepard was premeditated and driven by greed. McKinney&#x27;s defense counsel countered by arguing that he had intended only to rob Shepard but he killed him in a rage when Shepard made a sexual advance toward him. McKinney&#x27;s girlfriend told police that he had been motivated by anti-gay sentiment, but later, she recanted her statement, saying that she had lied because she thought she could help him by lying. Henderson pleaded guilty to murder, and McKinney was tried and found guilty of murder; each of them received two consecutive life sentences.

Shepard&#x27;s murder brought national and international attention to hate crime legislation at both the state and federal level. In October 2009, the United States Congress passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (commonly the &quot;Matthew Shepard Act&quot; or &quot;Shepard/Byrd Act&quot; for short), and on October 28, 2009, President Barack Obama signed the legislation into law. Following their son&#x27;s murder, Dennis and Judy Shepard became LGBTQ rights activists and established the Matthew Shepard Foundation. Shepard&#x27;s murder inspired a number of films, novels, plays, songs, and other works, including &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; (a 2000 play and 2002 film) and Judy Shepard&#x27;s 2009 memoir &quot;The Meaning of Matthew&quot;.

==Background==
Matthew Shepard was born in 1976 in Casper, Wyoming; he was the first of two sons born to Judy (née Peck) and Dennis Shepard. His younger brother, Logan, was born in 1981. The two brothers had a close relationship. Matthew was raised in the Episcopal denomination and had once served as an altar boy in the church. He attended Crest Hill Elementary School, Dean Morgan Junior High School, and Natrona County High School for his freshman through junior years. As a child, he was &quot;friendly with all his classmates&quot;, but was targeted and teased due to his small stature and lack of athleticism. He developed an interest in politics at an early age.

During his high school years, Matthew moved with his family to Saudi Arabia, when his father was hired by Saudi Aramco, a Saudi oil and natural gas company. With the family based at the Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran, Shepard completed high school in Switzerland, at the American School in Switzerland (TASIS). There, he participated in theater, and took German and Italian courses. In 1995, during a high school trip to Morocco, Shepard was abducted, beaten and raped. This caused him to experience depression and panic attacks, according to his mother. One of Shepard&#x27;s friends feared that his depression had driven him to become involved with drugs during his time at college. Multiple times, Shepard was hospitalized due to his clinical depression and suicidal ideation.

After graduating from high school in May 1995, Shepard attended Catawba College in North Carolina and Casper College in Wyoming, before settling in Denver, Colorado. Shepard became a first-year political science major at the University of Wyoming in Laramie with a minor in languages, and was chosen as the student representative for the Wyoming Environmental Council.

Shepard was described by his father as &quot;an optimistic and accepting young man who had a special gift of relating to almost everyone. He was the type of person who was very approachable and always looked to new challenges. Shepard had a great passion for equality and always stood up for the acceptance of people&#x27;s differences.&quot; Michele Josue, who had been Shepard&#x27;s friend and later created a documentary about him, &quot;Matt Shepard Is a Friend of Mine,&quot; described him as &quot;a tenderhearted and kind person.&quot;

==Murder==

On the night of October 6, 1998, Shepard was approached by Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie; all three men were in their early 20s. McKinney and Henderson offered to give Shepard a ride home. They subsequently drove to a remote rural area and proceeded to rob, pistol-whip, and torture Shepard, tying him to a split-rail fence and leaving him to die. It was erroneously reported by the news that he had been tied to a barbed wire fence. Many media reports contained the graphic account of the pistol-whipping and his fractured skull. Reports described how Shepard was beaten so brutally that his face was completely covered in blood, except where it had been partially cleansed by his tears.

The assailants&#x27; girlfriends testified that neither McKinney nor Henderson was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs at the time of the attack. McKinney and Henderson testified that they learned of Shepard&#x27;s address and intended to steal from his home as well. After attacking Shepard and leaving him tied to the fence in near-freezing temperatures, McKinney and Henderson returned to town. McKinney proceeded to pick a fight with two men, 19-year-old Emiliano Morales and 18-year-old Jeremy Herrara. The fight resulted in head wounds for both Morales and McKinney. Police officer Flint Waters arrived at the scene of the fight. He arrested Henderson, searched McKinney&#x27;s truck, and found a blood-smeared gun along with Shepard&#x27;s shoes and credit card. Henderson and McKinney later tried to persuade their girlfriends to provide alibis for them and help them dispose of evidence.

Still tied to the fence, Shepard was in a coma eighteen hours after the attack when he was discovered by Aaron Kreifels, a cyclist who initially mistook Shepard for a scarecrow. Reggie Fluty, the first police officer to arrive at the scene, found Shepard alive but covered in blood. Shepard was transported first to Ivinson Memorial Hospital in Laramie before being moved to the more advanced trauma ward at Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colorado. He had suffered fractures to the back of his head and in front of his right ear. He experienced severe brainstem damage, which affected his body&#x27;s ability to regulate his heart rate, body temperature, and other vital functions. There were also about a dozen small lacerations around his head, face, and neck. His injuries were deemed too severe for doctors to operate. Shepard never regained consciousness and remained on full life support. While he lay in intensive care and in the days following the attack, candlelight vigils were held in countries around the world.

Shepard was pronounced dead six days after the attack at 12:53 a.m. on October 12, 1998. He was 21 years old.

===Arrests and trial===
McKinney and Henderson were arrested and initially charged with attempted murder, kidnapping, and aggravated robbery. After Shepard&#x27;s death, the charges were upgraded from attempted murder to first-degree murder, which meant that the two defendants were eligible for the death penalty. Their girlfriends, Kristen Price and Chasity Pasley, were charged with being accessories after the fact. At McKinney&#x27;s November 1998 pretrial hearing, Sergeant Rob Debree testified that McKinney had stated in an interview on October 9 that he and Henderson had identified Shepard as a robbery target and pretended to be gay to lure him out to their truck, and that McKinney had attacked Shepard after Shepard put his hand on McKinney&#x27;s knee. Detective Ben Fritzen testified that Price stated McKinney told her the violence against Shepard was triggered by how McKinney &quot;[felt] about gays&quot;.

In December 1998, Pasley pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder. On April 5, 1999, Henderson avoided going to trial when he pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping charges. In order to avoid the death penalty, he agreed to testify against McKinney and was sentenced by District Judge Jeffrey A. Donnell to two consecutive life terms. At Henderson&#x27;s sentencing, his lawyer argued that Shepard had not been targeted because he was gay.

McKinney&#x27;s trial took place in October and November 1999. Prosecutor Cal Rerucha alleged that McKinney and Henderson pretended to be gay to gain Shepard&#x27;s trust. Price, McKinney&#x27;s girlfriend, testified that Henderson and McKinney had &quot;pretended they were gay to get [Shepard] in the truck and rob him.&quot; McKinney&#x27;s lawyer attempted to put forward a gay panic defense, arguing that McKinney was driven to temporary insanity by alleged sexual advances by Shepard. This defense was rejected by the judge. McKinney&#x27;s lawyer stated that the two men wanted to rob Shepard but never intended to kill him. Rerucha argued that the killing had been premeditated, driven by &quot;greed and violence&quot;, rather than by Shepard&#x27;s sexual orientation. The jury found McKinney not guilty of premeditated murder but guilty of felony murder and began to deliberate on the death penalty. Shepard&#x27;s parents brokered a deal that resulted in McKinney receiving two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. Henderson and McKinney were incarcerated in the Wyoming State Penitentiary in Rawlins and were later transferred to other prisons because of overcrowding. Following her testimony at McKinney&#x27;s trial, Price pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of misdemeanor interference with a police officer.

==Subsequent reporting==
===&quot;20/20&quot; report===
Shepard&#x27;s murder continued to attract public attention and media coverage long after the trial was over. In 2004, the ABC News news program &quot;20/20&quot; aired a report by TV journalist Elizabeth Vargas that quoted statements by McKinney, Henderson, Price, Rerucha, and a lead investigator. The statements alleged that the murder had not been motivated by Shepard&#x27;s sexuality but was primarily a drug-related robbery that had turned violent. Price said she had lied to police about McKinney having been provoked by an unwanted sexual advance from Shepard, telling Vargas, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it was a hate crime at all.&quot; Rerucha said, &quot;It was a murder that was once again driven by drugs.&quot;

The report was criticized by GLAAD as relying on speculation and statements by unreliable individuals changing their story. Judy Shepherd&#x27;s lawyer described the report as an oversimplification, while Michael Adams of Lambda Legal described it as an attempt to &quot;de-gay the murder&quot;.

===&quot;The Book of Matt&quot;===

Stephen Jimenez, the producer of the 2004 &quot;20/20&quot; segment, went on to write a book, &quot;The Book of Matt: Hidden Truths About the Murder of Matthew Shepard&quot;, which was published in September 2013. The book said that Shepard and McKinney—the killer who inflicted the injuries—had been occasional sex partners and that Shepard was a methamphetamine dealer. Jimenez wrote that Fritzen told an interviewer &quot;Matthew Shepard&#x27;s sexual preference or sexual orientation certainly wasn&#x27;t the motive in the homicide...&quot;.

Some commentators have criticized Jimenez&#x27;s views on the attack by classifying them as being sensational and misleading. Other commentators, however, have spoken up to defend them. Some police that were involved in the investigation have criticized Jimenez&#x27;s conclusions, while other police said that there was evidence that drugs were an important factor that led to the murder.

==Anti-gay protests==
Members of the Westboro Baptist Church, led by Fred Phelps, received national attention for picketing Shepard&#x27;s funeral with signs bearing homophobic slogans, such as &quot;Matt in Hell&quot; and &quot;God Hates Fags&quot;.

Church members also mounted anti-gay protests during the trials of Henderson and McKinney. In response, Romaine Patterson, one of Shepard&#x27;s friends, organized a group that assembled in a circle around the Westboro Baptist Church protesters. The group wore white robes and gigantic wings (resembling angels) that blocked the protesters. Despite this, Shepard&#x27;s parents were able to hear the protesters shouting anti-gay remarks and comments directed toward them. The police intervened and created a human barrier between the two groups. 

Angel Action was founded by Patterson in April 1999.

==Legacy==
In the years following her son&#x27;s death, Judy Shepard has worked as an advocate for LGBTQ rights, particularly issues relating to gay youth. She was a main force behind the Matthew Shepard Foundation, which she and her husband, Dennis, founded in December 1998.

Gay rights activist John Stoltenberg has said that to portray Shepard as a gay-bashing victim is to present an incomplete account of his victimization: &quot;Keeping Matthew as the poster boy of gay-hate crime and ignoring the full tragedy of his story has been the agenda of many gay-movement leaders. Ignoring the tragedies of Matthew&#x27;s life prior to his murder will do nothing to help other young men in our community who are sold for sex, ravaged by drugs, and generally exploited.&quot;

In June 2019, Shepard was one of the inaugural 50 American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall&#x27;s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

===Hate crime legislation===

Requests for new legislation to address hate crimes gained momentum during coverage of the incident. Under existing United States federal law and Wyoming state law, crimes committed on the basis of sexual orientation could not be prosecuted as hate crimes.

A few hours after Shepard was discovered, his friends Walt Boulden and Alex Trout began to contact media organizations, claiming that Shepard had been assaulted because he was gay. According to prosecutor Cal Rerucha, &quot;They were calling the County Attorney&#x27;s office, they were calling the media and indicating Matthew Shepard is gay and we don&#x27;t want the fact that he is gay to go unnoticed.&quot; Tina Labrie, a close friend of Shepard&#x27;s, said &quot;[Boulden and Trout] wanted to make [Matt] a poster child or something for their cause&quot;. Boulden linked the attack to the absence of a Wyoming criminal statute providing for a hate crimes charge.

In the following session of the Wyoming Legislature, a bill was introduced that defined certain attacks motivated by a victim&#x27;s sexual orientation as hate crimes. The measure failed on a 30–30 tie in the Wyoming House of Representatives.

President Bill Clinton renewed attempts to extend federal hate crime legislation to include gay people, women, and people with disabilities. A Hate Crimes Prevention Act was introduced in both the United States Senate and House of Representatives in November 1997, and reintroduced in March 1999, but was passed by only the Senate in July 1999. In September 2000, both houses of Congress passed such legislation; however, it was stripped out in conference committee.

On March 20, 2007, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act () was introduced as federal bipartisan legislation in the U.S. Congress, sponsored by Democrat John Conyers with 171 co-sponsors. It would amend the existing federal hate crimes definition and expand it to cover gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and require reporting by the FBI of those crimes included in the expansion. Shepard&#x27;s parents attended the introduction ceremony. The bill passed the House of Representatives on May 3, 2007. Similar legislation passed in the Senate on September 27, 2007 (), however then-President George W. Bush indicated he would veto the legislation if it reached his desk. The Democratic leadership dropped the legislation in response to opposition from conservative groups and Bush, and because the measure was attached to a defense bill there was a lack of support from antiwar Democrats. On December 10, 2007, congressional powers attached bipartisan hate crimes legislation to a Department of Defense Authorization bill, although it failed to pass. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, said she was &quot;still committed to getting the Matthew Shepard Act passed&quot;. Pelosi planned to get the bill passed in early 2008 although she did not succeed. Following his election as president, Barack Obama stated that he was committed to passing the act.

The U.S. House of Representatives debated expansion of hate crimes legislation on April 29, 2009. During the debate, Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina called the &quot;hate crime&quot; labeling of Shepard&#x27;s murder a &quot;hoax&quot;. Foxx later called her comments &quot;a poor choice of words&quot;. The House passed the act, designated , by a vote of 249 to 175. Ted Kennedy, Patrick Leahy, and a bipartisan coalition introduced the bill in the Senate on April 28; it had 43 cosponsors as of June 17, 2009. The Matthew Shepard Act was adopted as an amendment to S.1390 by a vote of 63–28 on July 15, 2009. On October 22, 2009, the Senate passed the act by a vote of 68–29. President Obama signed the measure into law on October 28, 2009.

===Interment in Washington National Cathedral===

On October 26, 2018, just over 20 years after his death, Shepard&#x27;s ashes were interred at the crypt of Washington National Cathedral. The ceremony was presided over by the first openly gay Episcopal bishop Gene Robinson, and the Bishop of Washington the Right Reverend Mariann Edgar Budde. Music was performed by the Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus of Washington, D.C.; GenOUT; and Conspirare, which performed Craig Hella Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Considering Matthew Shepard&quot;. His was the first interment of the ashes of a national figure at the cathedral since Helen Keller&#x27;s 50 years earlier.

===In popular culture===

Matthew Shepard&#x27;s life, death, trial, and its aftermath have inspired numerous works, including documentary and narrative films and television shows, stage plays (such as &quot;The Laramie Project&quot;), and musical and written works. Additionally, NBA player Jason Collins wore the jersey number &quot;98&quot; in honor of Shepard during his 2012–13 season with the Boston Celtics and the Washington Wizards, and he would come out as gay following the season. After Collins joined the Brooklyn Nets in 2014, NBA marketing reported high interest in his &quot;98&quot; jersey and high sales once the item became available for purchase.

&quot;The Meaning of Matthew: My Son&#x27;s Murder in Laramie, and a World Transformed&quot;, is a 2009 biographical book by Judy Shepard about her son. Judy Shepard speaks about her loss, her family memories of Matthew, and the tragic event that changed the Shepards&#x27; lives and America. &quot;The Meaning of Matthew&quot; follows the Shepard family in the days immediately after the crime to see their incapacitated son, kept alive by life support machines; how the Shepards learned of the huge public response, the candlelit vigils and memorial services for their child; and their struggles to navigate the legal system.

American musician Tori Amos frequently dedicated her 1998 song &quot;Merman&quot; to Shepard, at the request of fans following her tours at the time.

In 1999, American singer-songwriter Melissa Etheridge released the song &quot;Scarecrow&quot; in Shepard&#x27;s memory, from her sixth studio album &quot;Breakdown&quot;.

In 2006, American metal band Trivium released the song &quot;And Sadness Will Sear&quot;, which was written as a tribute and reminder about Shepard&#x27;s murder.

<text>In Hawaiian mythology, Nāmaka (or Nā-maka-o-Kahai, the eyes of Kahai) appears as a sea goddess in the Pele family. She is an older sister of Pele-honua-mea.

She is the daughter of Ku-waha-ilo and Haumea, whose other children are Pele, the Hiʻiaka sisters, the Kama brothers, and the bird Halulu. Nāmaka takes as her husband ʻAukelenuiaʻīkū, who had arrived in Lalakeenuiakane or in Kahiki (Tahiti), but he later becomes the husband of her sister Pele, and because of this Pele, the Hiiaka sisters, Malulani, and Kaʻōhelo migrate to Hawaii. When Pele quarrels with her powerful sister Nāmaka , Nāmaka sends tidal waves to destroy Pele&#x27;s lands and homes. Helped by her family, Pele fights Nāmaka, but Nāmaka defeats her.

In Thrum&#x27;s Kane-huna-moku myth, Nāmaka is called the chiefess of the Mu and Menehune people when they are summoned to build the watercourse for Kikiaola at Waimea on Kauai.

When Pele causes a conflagration by staying too close to the fire god Lono-makua, Nāmaka drives her away Another legend mentions that Nāmaka&#x27;s guardian dog, Moela is reduced to ashes when he touches ʻAukele.

==Moon==
Namaka, the smaller moon of the dwarf planet Haumea, is named after the goddess.

<text>In Hawaiian mythology, Nana-Ula or Nanaulu is the hero who led his people from Tahiti to Hawaii. He was the first King of Hawaii, and began the royal dynasty.

Kalakaua, during his reign as the last king of Hawaii, compiled the Legends and Mythology of Hawaii. He accepted the thesis of Abraham Fornander that the Polynesian &quot;race&quot; originated from &quot;Aryans&quot; in Asia Minor who emigrated to Southeast Asia via India and subsequent dispersal during the first and second centuries. These views were challenged at the time.
Their first general rendezvous was in the Fiji group, where they left their impress upon the native Papuans. Expelled from, or voluntarily leaving, the Fijis, after a sojourn there of several generations, the Polynesians scattered over the Pacific, occupying by stages the several groups of islands where they are now found. Moving by the way of the Samoan and Society Islands, the migratory wave did not reach the Hawaiian group until about the middle of the sixth century.

Nanaula, a distinguished chief, was the first to arrive from the southern islands. It is not known whether he discovered the group by being blown northward by adverse winds, or in deliberately adventuring far out upon the ocean in search of new lands. In either event, he brought with him his gods, priests, prophets and astrologers, and a considerable body of followers and retainers. He was also provided with dogs, swine and fowls, and the seeds and germs of useful plants for propagation. It is probable that he found the group without human inhabitants.

During that period——probably during the life of Nanaula——other chiefs of less importance arrived with their families and followers either from Tahiti or Samoa. They came in barges and large double canoes capable of accommodating from fifty to one hundred persons each. They brought with them not only their priests and gods, but the earliest of Polynesian traditions. It is thought that none of the pioneers of the time of Nanaula ever returned to the southern islands, nor did others immediately follow the first migratory wave that peopled the Hawaiian group.

<text>In Fijian mythology (Fiji), Daucina (&quot;torchbearer&quot;) is the great god of seafaring Fiji. When Daucina was a toddler, he was only quiet when looking at a lamp. His mother tied fiery reeds to his head so that he would be calm. He has roamed the coral reefs with a hood on ever since. He is a trickster and a patron of adulterers, and a seducer of women. He is known to appear to people in the form of a star or a handsome man.

<doc id="96488" wikidata="Q5251763" url="?curid=96488" title="Degei">
<text>In Fijian mythology, Degei (pronounced &quot;Ndengei&quot;), enshrined as a serpent, is the supreme god of Fiji. He is the creator of the (Fijian) world, fruits, and of men and is specially connected to Rakiraki District, Fiji. He judges newly dead souls after they pass through one of two caves: Cibaciba or Drakulu. A few he sends to paradise Burotu. Most others are thrown into a lake, where they will eventually sink to the bottom (Murimuria) to be appropriately rewarded or punished.

He is said to have at first moved about freely, but then in the form of a snake to have grown into the earth with his ringed tail. Since then he has become the god of earthquakes, storms and seasons. Whenever Degei shakes himself fertilising rain will fall, delicious fruits hang on the trees, and the yam fields yield an excellent crop.

Degei is also a god of wrath who declares himself in terrible fashion. He punishes and chastens his people by destroying the crops or by floods; he could indeed easily wipe out mankind from the earth, for since he has lived in the bowels of the earth he has been tormented with so insatiable hunger that he would like to take in and swallow the whole world.

Rokola is a name of the son of Degei.

== First human couple ==
Degei hatched an egg from which the first humans came to Earth.

== In popular culture ==
Friedrich Ratzel in &quot;The History of Mankind&quot; reported in 1896 a religious practice enjoined by Degei that involved tattooing women on the lower part of the body and the thigh, the corner of the mouth, and the finger.

R.A. Derrick (1957:11) says:
&quot;In these traditions Degei figures not only as the origin of the people, but also as a huge snake, living in a cave near the summit of the mountain Uluda – the northernmost peak of the Nakauvandra Range. Earth tremors and thunder were ascribed as his uneasy turnings within the cave. He took no interest in his people’s affairs; his existence was no more than a round of eating and sleeping. By association with him, snakes were honoured as ‘the Offspring of the origin’. The snake cult was generally throughout the group.&quot;

<text>In Cook Islands mythology (Aitutaki), Nganaoa is a hero who sighted and killed unusually large animals in the ocean while sailing with Rata.

== Family ==
Nganaoa is the son of Vaiaroa and Tairi-tokerau. He discovered his parents on an island, sitting next to a sennit.

== Boat request ==
Rata retrieved a canoe with his grandmother. He requested to enter the boat, claiming that he was excellent at flying kites. However, it did not please Rata, and Nganaoa was thrown overboard. However, Rata changed his mind and let him on the boat.

== Monsters ==
Nganaoa sighted a large clam and shouted to Rata &quot;O Rata! A fearful enemy is rising up from the sea!&quot;. Nganaoa was prepared and threw a spear into the clams stomach. After killing the clam, he claimed he saw another one.

Along the way, he discovered giant octopuses and whales. He attempted to kill a whale with his spear, but it broke into half. Before he was almost smashed by the whale, he cut him in half with both pieces of his spear.

<text>Ngaro (&quot;vanished&quot;) is mentioned as a delicacy of the dead in a Māori legend from the far north of the North Island of New Zealand.

Te Atarahi was five days and five nights in Te Reinga, the place from where the spirits of the dead leap into the underworld. His seemingly dead body was found by two women who went out to cut flax leaves. When Te Atarahi revived, he mentioned being offered food by the inhabitants of Te Reinga, and also offered the information that &quot;ngaro&quot; was one of their delicacies. The story as reported by Edward Shortland has a degree of similarity to the New Testament episode where Jesus rose after three days and three nights in the tomb; Christian influence may have played a role in the plot of this tale.

<doc id="96495" wikidata="Q296597" url="?curid=96495" title="Ian Paisley">
<text>Ian Richard Kyle Paisley, Baron Bannside, (6 April 1926 – 12 September 2014) was a loyalist politician and Protestant religious leader from Northern Ireland who served as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) from 1971 to 2008 and First Minister of Northern Ireland from 2007 to 2008.

Paisley became a Protestant evangelical minister in 1946 and remained one for the rest of his life. In 1951 he co-founded the Reformed fundamentalist Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster and was its leader until 2008. Paisley became known for his fiery sermons and regularly preached anti-Catholicism, anti-ecumenism and against homosexuality. He gained a large group of followers who were referred to as Paisleyites.

Paisley became involved in Ulster unionist/loyalist politics in the late 1950s. In the mid-late 1960s, he led and instigated loyalist opposition to the Catholic civil rights movement in Northern Ireland. This contributed to the outbreak of the Troubles in the late 1960s, a conflict that would engulf Northern Ireland for the next 30 years. In 1970 he became Member of Parliament for North Antrim and the following year he founded the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which he would lead for almost 40 years. In 1979 he became a Member of the European Parliament.

Throughout the Troubles, Paisley was seen as a firebrand and the face of hardline unionism. He opposed all attempts to resolve the conflict through power-sharing between unionists and Irish nationalists/republicans, and all attempts to involve the Republic of Ireland in Northern Irish affairs. His efforts helped bring down the Sunningdale Agreement of 1974. He also opposed the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, with less success. His attempts to create a paramilitary movement culminated in Ulster Resistance. Paisley and his party also opposed the Northern Ireland peace process and Good Friday Agreement of 1998.

In 2005, Paisley&#x27;s DUP became the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland, displacing the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), which had dominated unionist politics since 1905 and had been an instrumental party in the Good Friday Agreement. In 2007, following the St Andrews Agreement, the DUP finally agreed to share power with republican party Sinn Féin. Paisley and Sinn Féin&#x27;s Martin McGuinness became First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively, in May 2007. He stepped down as First Minister and DUP leader in mid-2008, and left politics in 2011. Paisley was made a life peer in 2010 as Baron Bannside.

==Personal life==
Ian Richard Kyle Paisley was born in Armagh, County Armagh, and brought up in the town of Ballymena, County Antrim, where his father James Kyle Paisley was an Independent Baptist pastor who had previously served in the Ulster Volunteers under Edward Carson. His mother was Scottish.

Paisley married Eileen Cassells on 13 October 1956. They had five children, daughters Sharon, Rhonda and Cherith and twin sons, Kyle and Ian. Three of their children followed their father into politics or religion: Kyle is a Free Presbyterian minister; Ian was a DUP MP; and Rhonda, a retired DUP councillor. He had a brother, Harold, who is also an evangelical fundamentalist.

Paisley saw himself primarily as an Ulsterman. However, despite his hostility towards Irish republicanism and the Republic of Ireland, he also saw himself as an Irishman and said that &quot;you cannot be an Ulsterman without being an Irishman&quot;.

==Religious career==
When he was a teenager, Paisley decided to follow his father and become a Christian minister. He delivered his first sermon aged 16 in a mission hall in County Tyrone. In the late 1940s he undertook theological training at the Barry School of Evangelism (now called the Wales Evangelical School of Theology), and later, for a year, at the Reformed Presbyterian Theological Hall in Belfast.

By June 1950 Paisley was preaching at an &#x27;Old Time Gospel Campaign&#x27; on waste ground off Moore Street in the lower Ravehill Road area of Belfast.

A year later a congregation of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland (PCI) was forbidden by church authorities to hold a meeting in their own church hall at which Paisley was to be the speaker. In response, the leaders of that congregation left the PCI and began a new denomination, the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, with Paisley, who was just 25 years old at the time. Paisley soon became the leader (or moderator) of the Free Presbyterian Church and was re-elected every year, for the next 57 years.
The Free Presbyterian Church is a fundamentalist, evangelical church, requiring strict separation from &quot;any church which has departed from the fundamental doctrines of the Word of God.&quot; At the time of the 1991 census, the church had about 12,000 members, less than 1 per cent of the Northern Ireland population.

Paisley promoted a highly conservative form of Biblical literalism and anti-Catholicism, which he described as &quot;Bible Protestantism&quot;. The website of Paisley&#x27;s public relations arm, the &quot;European Institute of Protestant Studies&quot;, describes the institute&#x27;s purpose as to &quot;expound the Bible, expose the Papacy, and to promote, defend and maintain Bible Protestantism in Europe and further afield.&quot; Paisley&#x27;s website describes a number of doctrinal areas in which he believes that the &quot;Roman church&quot; (which he termed &#x27;Popery&#x27;) has deviated from the Bible and thus from true Christianity. Over the years, Paisley would write numerous books and pamphlets on his religious and political views, including a commentary on the Epistle to the Romans. Paisley set up his own newspaper in February 1966, the &quot;Protestant Telegraph&quot;, as a mechanism for further spreading his message.

In the 1960s, Paisley developed a relationship with the fundamentalist Bob Jones University located in Greenville, South Carolina. In 1966, he received an honorary doctorate of divinity from the institution and subsequently served on its board of trustees. This relationship would later lead to the establishment of the Free Presbyterian Church of North America in 1977. His honorary doctorate, along with his political obstinacy, led to Paisley&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Dr. No&quot;.

When Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother met Pope John XXIII in 1958, Paisley condemned them for &quot;committing spiritual fornication and adultery with the Antichrist&quot;. When Pope John died in June 1963, Paisley announced to a crowd of followers that &quot;this Romish man of sin is now in Hell!&quot;. He organised protests against the lowering of flags on public buildings to mark the Pope&#x27;s death.

In 1988, having given advance warning of his intentions, Paisley interrupted a speech being delivered by Pope John Paul II in the European Parliament. Paisley shouted &quot;I denounce you as the Antichrist!&quot; and held up a poster reading &quot;Pope John Paul II ANTICHRIST&quot;. Other MEPs jeered Paisley, threw papers at him and snatched his poster, but he produced another and continued shouting. He was admonished by Parliamentary President Lord Plumb, who formally excluded him. He was then forcibly removed from the chamber. Paisley claims he was injured by other MEPs—including Otto von Habsburg—who struck him and threw objects at him.

Paisley believed the European Union is a part of a conspiracy to create a Roman Catholic superstate controlled by the Vatican. He claimed in an article that the seat no. 666 in the European Parliament is reserved for the Antichrist.

Paisley continued to denounce the Catholic Church and the Pope after the incident. In a television interview for &quot;The Unquiet Man&quot;, a 2001 documentary on Paisley&#x27;s life, he expressed his pride at being &quot;the only person to have the courage to denounce the Pope&quot;. However, after the death of Pope John Paul in 2005, Paisley expressed sympathy for Catholics, saying &quot;We can understand how Roman Catholics feel at the death of the Pope and we would want in no way to interfere with their expression of sorrow and grief at this time.&quot;

Paisley and his followers also protested against what they saw as instances of blasphemy in popular culture, including the stage productions &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot;, as well as being strongly anti-abortion.

===Campaign against homosexuality===

Paisley preached against homosexuality, supported laws criminalising it and picketed various gay rights events. He denounced it as &quot;a crime against God and man and its practice is a terrible step to the total demoralisation of any country&quot;. Save Ulster from Sodomy was a campaign launched by Paisley in 1977, in opposition to the Northern Ireland Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform, established in 1974. Paisley&#x27;s campaign sought to prevent the extension to Northern Ireland of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, which had decriminalised homosexual acts between males over 21 years of age in England and Wales. Paisley&#x27;s campaign failed when legislation was passed in 1982 as a result of the previous year&#x27;s ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of &quot;Dudgeon v United Kingdom&quot;.

==Political career, 1949–2010==

===Early activism===
In 1949, Paisley formed a Northern Irish branch of the National Union of Protestants, the group being led in the UK by his uncle, W. St Clair Taylor. Paisley&#x27;s first political involvement came at the 1950 general election when he campaigned on behalf of the successful Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) candidate in Belfast West, the Church of Ireland minister James Godfrey MacManaway. Independent Unionist MP Norman Porter came to lead the National Union of Protestants, while Paisley became treasurer, but Paisley left after Porter refused to join the Free Presbyterian Church.

Paisley first hit headlines in 1956 when Maura Lyons, a 15-year-old Belfast Catholic doubting her faith, sought his help and was smuggled illegally to Scotland by members of his Free Presbyterian Church. Paisley publicly played a tape of her religious conversion but refused to help with the search for her, saying he would rather go to prison than return her to her Catholic family. Lyons eventually returned both to her family and Catholicism.

In 1956, Paisley was one of the founders of Ulster Protestant Action (UPA). Its initial purpose was to organise the defence of Protestant areas against anticipated Irish Republican Army (IRA) activity. It carried out vigilante patrols, made street barricades, and drew up lists of IRA suspects in both Belfast and rural areas. The UPA was to later become the Protestant Unionist Party in 1966. UPA factory and workplace branches were formed, including one by Paisley in Belfast&#x27;s Ravenhill area under his direct control. The concern of the UPA increasingly came to focus on the defence of &#x27;Bible Protestantism&#x27; and Protestant interests where jobs and housing were concerned. The UPA also campaigned against the allocation of public housing to Catholics.

As Paisley came to dominate UPA, he received his first convictions for public order offences. In June 1959, Paisley addressed a UPA rally in the mainly-Protestant Shankill district of Belfast. During the speech, he shouted out the addresses of some Catholic-owned homes and businesses in the area. These homes and businesses were then attacked by the crowd; windows were smashed, shops were looted and &quot;Taigs out&quot; painted on the doors.

During the 1964 UK general election campaign, an Irish republican candidate displayed an Irish tricolour from the window of his office in a republican area of Belfast. Paisley threatened that if the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) did not remove the tricolour he would lead a march to the office and take it down himself. The Flags and Emblems Act banned the public display of any symbol, with the exception of the Union Flag, that could cause a breach of the peace. In response, armed officers arrived at the building, smashed their way inside and seized the flag. This led to severe rioting between republicans and the RUC. Thirty people, including at least 18 officers, had to be hospitalised.

===Opposition to the civil rights movement===
In 1964, a peaceful civil rights campaign began in Northern Ireland. The civil rights movement sought to end discrimination against Catholics and those of Catholic background by the Protestant and unionist government of Northern Ireland. Paisley instigated and led loyalist opposition to the civil rights movement over the next few years. He also led opposition against Terence O&#x27;Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Although O&#x27;Neill was also unionist, Paisley and his followers saw him as being too &#x27;soft&#x27; on the civil rights movement and opposed his policies of reform and reconciliation.

In April 1966, Paisley and his associate Noel Doherty founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC) and its paramilitary wing, the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV). At the time, Irish republicans were marking the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising. Although the IRA was inactive, loyalists such as Paisley warned that it was about to be revived and launch another campaign against Northern Ireland. At the same time, a loyalist paramilitary group calling itself the &quot;Ulster Volunteer Force&quot; (UVF) emerged in the Shankill area of Belfast, led by Gusty Spence. Many of its members were also members of the UCDC and UPV, including UCDC secretary and UPV leader Noel Doherty. Paisley publicly thanked the UVF for taking part in a march on 7 April. Paisley forced the Stormont government to mobilise B-Specials for the entire month of April with the hope of outlawing public commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. Paisley failed in this objective but did succeed in pressuring the government to ban trains from the Republic transporting people to Northern Ireland for the ceremonies. In May and June, the UVF petrol bombed a number of Catholic homes, schools and businesses. It also shot dead two Catholic civilians as they walked home. These are sometimes seen as the first deaths of the Troubles. Following the killings, the UVF was outlawed and Paisley denied any knowledge of its activities. One of those convicted for the killings said after his arrest &quot;I am terribly sorry I ever heard of that man Paisley or decided to follow him&quot;.

Paisley would later establish two other paramilitary groups: Third Force in 1981 and Ulster Resistance in 1986.

On 6 June 1966, Paisley led a march to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church against what he claimed to be its &quot;Romeward trend&quot;. The authorities allowed the marchers to go through the Catholic Cromac Square neighbourhood carrying placards with anti-Catholic slogans. Catholic youths attacked the march and clashed with the RUC. Many were injured and cars and businesses were wrecked. Following the riots, Paisley was charged with unlawful assembly and sentenced to three months in prison. The &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; declared that Paisley&#x27;s organisations &quot;represent a defiance of lawful authority no less serious in essence than that of the IRA&quot;. On 22 July 1966, Paisleyites clashed with the RUC outside Crumlin Road Prison, where Paisley was being held. The next day, Protestant mobs several thousand strong &quot;rampaged through the city, smashing windows and trying to damage businesses owned by Catholics&quot;. In response, the authorities banned all meetings and marches in Belfast for three months.

On 30 November 1968, hours before a civil rights march in Armagh, Paisley and Ronald Bunting arrived in the town in a convoy of cars. Men armed with nail-studded cudgels emerged from the cars and took over the town centre to prevent the march. The RUC halted the civil rights march, sparking outrage from activists. On 25 March 1969, Paisley and Bunting were jailed for organising the illegal counter-demonstration. On 6 May, they were released during a general amnesty for people convicted of political offences.

In March–April 1969, the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV) bombed water and electricity installations in Northern Ireland, leaving much of Belfast without power and water. Paisley and the UPV blamed the bombings on the dormant IRA and elements of the civil rights movement. Paisley&#x27;s &quot;Protestant Telegraph&quot; called them &quot;the first act of sabotage perpetrated by the IRA since the murderous campaign of 1956&quot;, warning that it was &quot;an ominous indication of what lies ahead for Ulster&quot;. Many people believed these claims of IRA responsibility. The loyalists also hoped that the bombings would weaken confidence in Prime Minister Terence O&#x27;Neill. Unionist support for O&#x27;Neill waned, and on 28 April he resigned as Prime Minister. Paisley&#x27;s approach led him, in turn, to oppose O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s successors as Prime Minister, Major James Chichester-Clark (later Lord Moyola) and Brian Faulkner.

The civil rights campaign, and attacks on it by loyalists and police, culminated in the August 1969 riots. The 1969 Northern Ireland riots, Divis Street were the worst in Belfast since the 1930s. Catholic Irish nationalists clashed with the police and with loyalists, who invaded Catholic neighbourhoods and burned scores of homes and businesses. This led to the deployment of British troops and is seen by many as the beginning of the Troubles. Journalists Patrick Bishop and Eamonn Mallie said of the rioting in Belfast: &quot;Both communities were in the grip of a mounting paranoia about the other&#x27;s intentions. Catholics were convinced that they were about to become victims of a Protestant pogrom; Protestants that they were on the eve of an IRA insurrection&quot;. After the riots, Paisley is reported to have said:Catholic homes caught fire because they were loaded with petrol bombs; Catholic churches were attacked and burned because they were arsenals and priests handed out sub-machine guns to parishioners.

===Electoral success and founding of the DUP===

On 16 April 1970, in a by-election to the Northern Ireland Parliament, Paisley, standing on behalf of the Protestant Unionist Party, won the Bannside seat formerly held by Prime Minister Terence O&#x27;Neill. Another PUP candidate, William Beattie, won the South Antrim seat. In the 1970 UK general election, Paisley won the North Antrim seat. These elections were &quot;further evidence of the break-up of the unionist block and the unease among a large section of Protestants about the reform measures introduced under Chichester-Clark&quot;.

On 30 September 1971, Paisley and Desmond Boal founded the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).

===Relationship with the nationalist SDLP===
From the 1960s, one of his main rivals was civil rights leader and co-founder of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), John Hume. British Government papers, released in 2002, show that in 1971 Paisley attempted to reach a compromise with the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). The attempt was made via then British Cabinet Secretary, Sir Burke Trend. The papers show that Paisley had indicated he could &quot;reach an accommodation with leaders of the Catholic minority, which would provide the basis of a new government in Stormont.&quot; It appears that the move was rejected once it became clear to the SDLP that it would have created a very one-sided alliance. Speaking about the deal in 2002 Paisley said: 

Promoting the DUP&#x27;s manifesto at a launch event ahead of the 1983 United Kingdom general election Paisley made clear that the core message of the party&#x27;s campaign would be to &quot;expose and oppose Provisional Sinn Fein and its fellow travellers, the SDLP.&quot; Responding to reporters, Paisley said:

Speaking at the launch of the DUP&#x27;s policy proposals for devolved government for the briefly revived Northern Ireland Assembly in September 1984, Paisley echoed the document&#x27;s position on power-sharing with the SDLP:

In one interview during the referendum campaign following the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, he declared that he
was &#x27;opposed to power-sharing with nationalists because nationalists are only power-sharing to destroy Northern Ireland&#x27; clearly meaning the SDLP as well as Sinn Féin.

===Campaign against the Sunningdale Agreement===
The Sunningdale Agreement of December 1973 set up a new government for Northern Ireland in which unionists and nationalists would share power. It also proposed the creation of a Council of Ireland, which would facilitate co-ordination and co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Paisley and other hardline unionists opposed the Agreement. Specifically, they opposed sharing political power with nationalists and saw the Council of Ireland as a step towards a united Ireland.

Paisley, along with anti-Agreement Ulster Unionist Party leader Harry West and Ulster Vanguard leader William Craig, formed the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC) to oppose the Agreement. Its slogan was &quot;Dublin is just a Sunningdale away&quot;. Loyalists formed the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council (UWC) to mobilise loyalist workers against the Agreement, while the loyalist paramilitary groups (UDA, UVF etc.) formed the Ulster Army Council (UAC) to co-ordinate their response.

Addressing an anti-Agreement rally in January 1974, Paisley declared:Mr Faulkner says it&#x27;s &#x27;hands across the border&#x27; to Dublin. I say if they don&#x27;t behave themselves in the South, it will be &quot;shots&quot; across the border!

On 15 May 1974, the UWC called a general strike aimed at bringing down the Agreement and the new government. A co-ordinating committee was set up to help organise the strike. It included Paisley and the other UUUC leaders, the leaders of the UWC, and the heads of the loyalist paramilitary groups. Its chairman was Glenn Barr, a high-ranking member of Ulster Vanguard and the UDA. In its first meeting, Barr arrived late and found Paisley sitting at the head of the table. Barr told him &quot;you might be chairman of the Democratic Unionist Party but I&#x27;m chairman of the co-ordinating committee, so move over&quot;. Paisley moved from the head of the table but carried the chair away with him and the two argued over the chair itself, with Paisley eventually allowed to keep it as he claimed to need a chair with arms due to back pain.

The strike lasted fourteen days and brought Northern Ireland to a standstill. Loyalist paramilitaries helped to enforce the strike by blocking roads and intimidating workers. On 17 May, the third day of the strike, loyalists detonated four car bombs in Dublin and Monaghan, in the Republic of Ireland. The bombs killed 33 civilians and injured 300, making it the deadliest attack of the Troubles, and the deadliest terrorist attack in the Republic&#x27;s history. In an interview nine months before his death, Paisley said he was &quot;shocked&quot; by the bombings, but claimed that the Republic&#x27;s government provoked the attack. The strike led to the downfall of the Agreement on 28 May.

===Unionist Action Council strike===
In 1977 the United Unionist Action Council (UUAC) was formed out of the UUUC. The council was chaired by Joseph Burns and included Paisley, Ernest Baird (leader of the United Ulster Unionist Movement), members of the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council, and leaders of loyalist paramilitaries including the UDA, Orange Volunteers and Down Orange Welfare. The UUAC also established its own loyalist vigilante group called the Ulster Service Corps (USC).

On 3 May 1977, the UUAC organised a general strike. It was seen by the public as &quot;Paisley&#x27;s strike&quot;, due to his prominent role in it. The main aims of the strike were to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland under a system of simple majority (i.e. unionist) rule and to force the British Government to introduce tougher security measures against the IRA. As in 1974, loyalist paramilitaries tried to enforce the strike by blocking roads, intimidating workers and attacking businesses that refused to co-operate. However, unlike in 1974, many workers refused to join the strike and the security forces were better prepared. The Ulster Service Corps set up roadblocks and carried out patrols in rural areas. Some members carried guns, although these were generally legally-held firearms. During a speech in the House of Commons, Paisley claimed to have taken part in some of these patrols and encouraged his supporters to join the group. On 10 May, Protestant bus driver Harry Bradshaw was shot dead by loyalists for working during the strike, and UDR soldier John Geddis was killed when loyalists bombed a petrol station that had stayed open. That same day, Paisley, Baird and other members of the UUAC were arrested at a roadblock outside Ballymena. Paisley was charged with obstruction of the highway and then released.

On 13 May, the strike was called off. The strike was widely seen as a failure, but Paisley—who had said he would quit politics if it failed—declared it a success and continued his career. The RUC later reported that three people had been killed by loyalists during the strike, 41 RUC officers had been injured, there had been thousands of reports of intimidation, and 115 people had been charged with offences.

===Election to European Parliament===
Paisley opposed the European Economic Community (EEC) but stood for election to the European Parliament to give a platform to his views and those of his supporters. In June 1979, in the first election to the European Parliament, Paisley won one of the three Northern Ireland seats. He topped the poll, with 29.8% of the first preference votes. On 17 July, Paisley interrupted the opening proceedings of the European Parliament to protest that the Union Jack outside the building was flying upside down. Louise Weiss, who presided over the Parliament, dealt with the interruption swiftly and later said of it that she was used to dealing with &quot;recalcitrant youngsters&quot;. On 18 July, Paisley tried to interrupt Jack Lynch—then Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) and President of the European Council—as he was making a speech in the Parliament. Paisley was shouted down by other MEPs.

Paisley easily retained his seat in every European election until he stood down in 2004, receiving the highest popular vote of any British MEP (although as Northern Ireland uses a different electoral system from Great Britain for European elections, the figures are not strictly comparable).

===Third Force===
During 1981, Paisley attempted to create a Protestant loyalist volunteer militia—called the (Ulster) Third Force—which would work alongside the police and army to fight the IRA. At the time, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was holding talks with Taoiseach Charles Haughey, and the Irish republican hunger strike was underway.

On the night of 6 February 1981, Paisley summoned journalists to a hillside in County Antrim, where he had gathered 500 men. The men were photographed in military formation, waving what purported to be firearms certificates in the air. Paisley declared: &quot;This is a small token of the men who are placed to devastate any attempt by Margaret Thatcher and Charles Haughey to destroy the Union&quot;. He added: &quot;I will take full responsibility for anything these men do. We will stop at nothing.&quot;

Paisley helped organise further night-time rallies on 1 April, where large groups of men brandished more pieces of paper. They were held on hillsides near Gortin, Armagh and Newry. At Gortin, the police were attacked and two police vehicles overturned. On 16 November, Paisley addressed a large Third Force rally in Enniskillen, where hundreds of men marched in a show of strength. Paisley organised a loyalist &#x27;Day of Action&#x27; on 23 November, to pressure the British government to take a harder line against the IRA. Rallies were held in Protestant areas of Northern Ireland and a number of businesses shut. The DUP and UUP held separate rallies at Belfast City Hall. That night, Paisley addressed a Third Force rally in Newtownards, where thousands of masked and uniformed men marched before him. He declared:My men are ready to be recruited under the crown to destroy the vermin of the IRA. But if they refuse to recruit them, then we will have no other decision to make but to destroy the IRA ourselves!

On 3 December, Paisley claimed that the Third Force had 15,000–20,000 members. James Prior, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, replied that private armies would not be tolerated.

In December 1981, the State Department of the United States revoked Paisley&#x27;s visa, citing his &quot;divisive rhetoric&quot; and forcing him to cancel plans for a two-week speaking and fundraising tour in the US. He insisted the cancellation was part of a &quot;conspiracy between the Thatcher Government and the U.S.A. Government to sell out Ulster&quot;.

===Campaign against the Anglo-Irish Agreement===
The Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed by the British and Irish governments on 15 November 1985, following months of talks between the two governments. The Agreement confirmed that there would be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority of its citizens, and set out conditions for the creation of a power-sharing government for Northern Ireland. It also gave the Irish government an advisory role on political, legal and security matters in Northern Ireland.

Led by Paisley and UUP leader James Molyneaux, unionists mounted a major protest campaign against the Agreement, dubbed &quot;Ulster Says No&quot;. Both unionist parties resigned their seats in the British House of Commons, suspended district council meetings, and supported a campaign of mass civil disobedience. There were strikes and mass protest rallies. On 23 November 1985, more than 100,000 people attended a rally at Belfast City Hall. The rally was addressed by Paisley and Molyneaux. In his address, Paisley famously stated:

&quot;Where do the terrorists operate from? From the Irish Republic! &lt;br&gt;Where do the terrorists return to for sanctuary? To the Irish Republic!&lt;br&gt; 
And yet Mrs Thatcher tells us that that Republic must have some say in our Province.
We say Never! Never! Never! Never!

On 23 June 1986, Paisley and 21 other unionist politicians occupied the Stormont Parliament Building in protest at the Agreement, while 200 supporters protested outside and clashed with police. Paisley and the others were forcibly removed by police the next day. He shouted at police officers: &quot;Don&#x27;t come crying to me if your homes are attacked. You will reap what you sow!&quot; During the campaign against the Agreement, loyalist militants attacked the homes of over 500 police officers, forcing 150 families to move. That evening, he addressed an Ulster Clubs rally in Larne and warned:If the British government force us down the road to a united Ireland we will fight to the death! [...] This could come to hand-to-hand fighting in every street in Northern Ireland. We are on the verge of civil war [...] We are asking people to be ready for the worst and I will lead them. On 10 July, Paisley and deputy DUP leader Peter Robinson led 4,000 loyalists in an early morning protest in which they &#x27;took over&#x27; and &#x27;occupied&#x27; the town of Hillsborough in protest against the Agreement. Hillsborough Castle is where the Agreement had been signed. One month later, Robinson led a loyalist invasion of the village of Clontibret in the Republic of Ireland. Robinson was arrested and charged for his part in the incident. Paisley and many loyalist supporters travelled south to support him during his court appearance in Dundalk. Their singing of loyalist songs outside the courthouse led to rioting, causing Paisley and Robinson to lodge a formal complaint with the Foreign Office about what they said was inadequate protection.

On 10 November 1986, a large private rally was held in the Ulster Hall. At the rally, Paisley and DUP members Peter Robinson and Ivan Foster announced the formation of the Ulster Resistance Movement (URM). This was a loyalist paramilitary organisation whose purpose was to &quot;take direct action as and when required&quot; to bring down the Agreement and defeat republicanism. Paisley, who stood on the platform in a red beret, said &quot;there are many like myself who&#x27;d like to see the Agreement brought down by democratic means, but wouldn&#x27;t we all be fools if we weren&#x27;t prepared&quot;. Other recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and the movement was organised into nine &#x27;battalions&#x27;. The following year, the URM helped smuggle a large shipment of weapons into Northern Ireland, which were shared out between the URM, UVF and UDA. Most, but not all, of the weaponry, was seized by police in 1988. In 1989, URM members attempted to trade Shorts&#x27; missile blueprints for weapons from the apartheid South African regime. Following these revelations, the DUP said that it had cut its links with the URM in 1987.

On 9 December 1986, Paisley was once again ejected from the European Parliament for continually interrupting a speech by Margaret Thatcher.

===Drumcree dispute===
Paisley was involved in the Drumcree dispute during the late 1980s and 1990s. He supported the right of the Orange Order, a Protestant unionist fraternal organisation, to march through the Catholic part of Portadown. The Catholic residents sought to ban the yearly march from their area, seeing it as sectarian, triumphalist and supremacist. Paisley was a former member of the Orange Order and belonged to a similar Protestant brotherhood: the Apprentice Boys. He also addressed the yearly gathering of the Independent Orange Order.

On 30 March 1986, a loyalist march was banned from the Catholic district. At midnight, 3,000 loyalists gathered in the town centre. Led by Paisley, they forced their way past police and marched through the Catholic district. Residents claimed that some of the marchers were carrying guns and that police did little to stop the loyalists attacking their homes. This led to severe rioting between residents and the police.

In July 1995, residents succeeded in stopping the Orange march from entering their area. Thousands of Orangemen and loyalists engaged in a standoff with the police and army at Drumcree Church. Paisley addressed a rally at Drumcree, telling a crowd of thousands:We will die if necessary rather than surrender! If we don&#x27;t win this battle all is lost. It is a matter of life and death; it is a matter of Ulster or the Irish Republic; it is a matter of freedom or slavery!

Afterwards, Paisley gathered a throng of Orangemen and tried to push through the police lines, but was arrested. Loyalists threw missiles at the police and tried to break through the blockade; police responded with plastic bullets. In support of the Orangeman, loyalists blocked roads across Northern Ireland, and there were attacks on Catholics and the police. The march was eventually allowed to continue through the Catholic area. As the march ended, Paisley and David Trimble held hands in the air in what appeared to be a gesture of triumph, causing considerable ill-feeling among the Catholic residents.

===Campaign against the Good Friday Agreement===

Paisley&#x27;s DUP was initially involved in the negotiations under former United States Senator George J. Mitchell that eventually led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, but the party withdrew in protest when Sinn Féin was allowed to participate after the Provisional IRA&#x27;s 1994 ceasefire. Instead, Paisley travelled to Cameroon with the documentary filmmaker Jon Ronson, filming an episode of the television series &quot;Witness&quot; called &quot;Dr Paisley, I Presume&quot;. Paisley and his party opposed the Agreement in the referendum that followed its signing, which saw it approved by over 70% of the voters in Northern Ireland and by over 90% of voters in the Republic of Ireland.

Although Paisley often stressed his loyalty to the Crown, he accused Queen Elizabeth of being Tony Blair&#x27;s &quot;parrot&quot; when she voiced approval of the Agreement.

The DUP fought the resulting election to the Northern Ireland Assembly, to which Paisley was elected while keeping his seats in the Westminster and European parliaments. The DUP took two seats in the multi-party power-sharing executive (Paisley, like the leaders of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Sinn Féin chose not to become a minister) but those DUP members serving as ministers (Peter Robinson and Nigel Dodds) refused to attend meetings of the Executive Committee (cabinet) in protest at Sinn Féin&#x27;s participation.

Paisley assumed the chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly created by the Belfast Agreement. The Minister for Agriculture, the SDLP&#x27;s Bríd Rodgers, remarked that she and Paisley had a &quot;workmanlike&quot; relationship.

===2000s: compromise and power===

At the age of 78, Paisley retired from his European Parliament seat at the 2004 elections and was succeeded by Jim Allister. In September 2004, he agreed to meet Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, in his political capacity as leader of the DUP. At an early meeting with Ahern at the Irish embassy in London, he requested breakfast and asked for boiled eggs; when Ahern asked him why he had wanted boiled eggs, he quipped &quot;it would be hard for you to poison them&quot;. Following rumours and a marked change in his appearance, it was confirmed in July 2004 that Paisley had been undergoing tests for an undisclosed illness, and in 2005 Ian Paisley Jr. confirmed that his father had been gravely ill. Paisley himself later said that he had &quot;walked in death&#x27;s shadow.&quot;

Paisley again retained his North Antrim seat in the 2005 UK general election. In 2005, he was made a Privy Counsellor, an appointment traditionally bestowed upon leaders of political parties in the British Parliament. In the October 2006 St Andrews Agreement, Paisley and the DUP agreed to new elections, and support for a new executive including Sinn Féin subject to Sinn Féin acceptance of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the successor to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. This reversed half a century of opposition to Sinn Féin, such as his comments four months previously on 12 July in Portrush, following Orange Order parades, when he said, &quot;[Sinn Fein] are not fit to be in partnership with decent people. They are not fit to be in the government of Northern Ireland and it will be over our dead bodies if they ever get there.&quot; Sinn Féin subsequently endorsed the PSNI, and in the subsequent election Paisley and the DUP received an increased share of the vote and increased their assembly seats from 30 to 36. On Monday 26 March 2007, the date of the British Government deadline for devolution or dissolution, Paisley led a DUP delegation to a meeting with a Sinn Féin delegation led by Gerry Adams, which agreed on a DUP proposal that the executive would be established on 8 May.

On 8 May 2007 power was devolved, the Assembly met, and Paisley and Sinn Féin&#x27;s Martin McGuinness were elected First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland.

Speaking at Stormont to an invited international audience he said, &quot;Today at long last we are starting upon the road—I emphasise starting—which I believe will take us to lasting peace in our province.&quot; Paisley and McGuinness subsequently established a good working relationship and were dubbed the &quot;Chuckle Brothers&quot; by the Northern Irish media. In September 2007, he confirmed that he would contest North Antrim at the 2010 general election as well as serving the full four years as First Minister, stating &quot;I might as well make hay while the sun shines.&quot;

In 2007, Paisley was named as &quot;Opposition Parliamentarian of the Year&quot; in The House Magazine Parliamentary Awards and by &quot;The Spectator&quot; as &quot;Marathon Man of the Year.&quot; Following his January 2008 retirement as leader of the Free Presbyterian Church and pressure from party insiders, on 4 March 2008, Paisley announced that he would stand down as DUP leader and First Minister of Northern Ireland in May 2008. On 17 April, Peter Robinson was elected unopposed as leader of the DUP and succeeded Paisley as First Minister at a special sitting of the assembly on 5 June 2008. On 2 March 2010, it was announced that Paisley would step down as a Member of Parliament at that year&#x27;s general election. His son Ian Paisley Jr. was elected to succeed him in the seat at the general election on 6 May 2010.

On 18 June 2010, Paisley was created a life peer as &quot;Baron Bannside, of North Antrim in the County of Antrim&quot;, and he was introduced in the House of Lords on 5 July 2010. Bannside was the Northern Ireland Parliament constituency Paisley had won in 1970; he opted not to take the title of &quot;Lord Paisley&quot; as his wife was already in the House as Baroness Paisley and he said that it would have implied she was &quot;sitting not in her own right but as my wife&quot;.

==Final years and death (2010–14)==
In November 2011, Paisley announced to his congregation, which he had led for over 60 years, that he would retire as minister. He delivered his final sermon to a packed attendance at the Martyrs&#x27; Memorial Hall on 18 December 2011, and finally retired from his religious ministry at the age of 85, on 27 January 2012.

In February 2012, Paisley was admitted to hospital with heart problems. Jim Flanagan, editor of the &quot;Ballymena Guardian&quot;, who spoke to close family friends, said that Paisley had been able to communicate &quot;to some degree&quot; with family members. A year before, he had had a pacemaker fitted due to cardiac arrhythmia, during his time in the House of Lords. In late December 2013, Paisley was once again taken to hospital for &quot;necessary tests&quot;. Ian Paisley Jr. emphasised that they were routine.

Paisley died in Belfast on 12 September 2014, aged 88. His body was buried at Ballygowan, in County Down on 15 September following a private funeral, and a public memorial for 830 invited guests was held in the Ulster Hall on 19 October 2014. A &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary reported that late in life Paisley had moderated and softened his stances against Roman Catholics but that &quot;the legacies of fighting and religious hatreds remained.&quot;

<text>In Hawaiian mythology, Nu&#x27;u was a man who built an ark with which he escaped a Great Flood. He landed his vessel on top of Mauna Kea on the Big Island. Nu&#x27;u mistakenly attributed his safety to the moon, and made sacrifices to it. Kāne, the creator god, descended to earth on a rainbow and explained Nu&#x27;u&#x27;s mistake. The myth has been interpreted as depicting the hazards of the Oceanian environment and local peoples&#x27; ability to withstand them. Missionaries to Hawaii in the 19th century considered him analogous to Noah of the Bible.

Some tellings also say Uenuku had built a canoe for his 70 sons and set about to do their hair with sacred combs for the first voyage, or that Ruatapu was about to use Uenuku&#x27;s own sacred comb rather than Kahutia&#x27;s. Either way, Ruatapu is told he cannot use any sacred comb because of his heritage, and is shamed.

In other accounts, the rebuke came when dared to walk on the roof of &#x27;s house.

==&#x27;s revenge==

Angry and ashamed at his father&#x27;s disparaging comments, he lured and a large number of the other noble sons of into a canoe the next day and took them out to sea. He had hid the bailer somewhere onshore prior, and as soon as they were far enough he unplugged a preformed hole on the canoe flooring, drowning all members aboard - apart from who recited an incantation invoking his ancestor Tangaroa, or the goddess Moakuramanu, to call forth a whale (usually considered to be a southern humpback whale - to carry him ashore. was the sole survivor of his brother&#x27;s evildoing and assumed the name as a memorial of the assistance he received from the whale.

In some versions, himself transformed into the whale. In some tellings Ruatapu simply slays everybody with a spear once they&#x27;re out at sea - again with the exception of Paikea who takes to the oceans and is saved by the gods.

The episode where threatens to return as the great waves of the eighth month may explain other accounts which portray as having invoked a great flood which destroyed Hawaiki.

==Kāti Kurī version==
In a version probably recorded from Kaikōura, Paikea was the youngest of Uenuku&#x27;s sons, and his favourite, which made the other siblings incredibly jealous of him. His brothers plot to kill him, intending to slay him out on a fishing trip and tell Uenuku that he drowned. Paikea, through feigning his sleep that night, learned of the plan, and so deliberately sunk the canoe the next day himself, killing his brothers. Paikea alone remained alive, clinging to the remains of the canoe for survival, awaiting his death. Suddenly, a tohorā came to his aid, and carried him all the way to Whāngārā.

<text>In Hawaiian mythology, Pakaʻa is the god of the wind and the inventor of the sail.

In the legend, Pakaʻa was the child of a traveling royal named Kuanuʻuanu and a beautiful common woman named Laʻamaomao. Kuanu&#x27;uanu was summoned back to his liege Keawenuiaumi before Pakaʻa&#x27;s birth. Pakaʻa was then raised by Laʻamaomao and her elder brother Maʻilou, who Pakaʻa was told was his father. Pakaʻa however questioned this, because despite his young age, he was much taller than Maʻilou. 

He then went traveling with the king of Kauaʻi, Paiʻea, to the other Hawaiian Islands, taking the Gord of Laʻamaomao, which gave him control over the many winds of Hawaii.

He later served under Keawenuiaumi and taught his son Ku-a-Pakaʻa to follow in his footsteps.

==Mythologies==
In some of these legends, the Pouākai kills and eats humans. The myth may refer to the real but now extinct Haast&#x27;s eagle: the largest known eagle species, which was able to kill an adult moa weighing up to , and which potentially had the capability to kill a small child.
==History==
Haast&#x27;s eagles, which lived only in the east and northwest of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, did not become extinct until around two hundred years after the arrival of Māori. Eagles are depicted in early rock-shelter paintings in South Canterbury. Large amounts of the eagle&#x27;s lowland habitat had been destroyed by burning by AD 1350, and it was driven extinct by overhunting, both directly (Haast&#x27;s eagle bones have been found in Māori archaeological sites) and indirectly: its main prey species, nine species of moa and other large birds such as adzebills, flightless ducks, and flightless geese, were hunted to extinction at the same time.

<text>Slash fiction (also known as &quot;m/m slash&quot; or slashfic) is a genre of fan fiction that focuses on romantic or sexual relationships between fictional characters of the same sex. While the term &quot;slash&quot; originally referred only to stories in which male characters are involved in an explicit sexual relationship as a primary plot element, it is now also used to refer to any fan story containing a romantic pairing between same-sex characters. Many fans distinguish slash with female characters as a separate genre, commonly referred to as femslash (also known as &quot;f/f slash&quot; or &quot;femmeslash&quot;).

These fan-written stories are not often accepted in a work&#x27;s canon, and the characters are usually not engaged in such relationships in their respective fictional universes.

==History==
It is commonly believed that slash fan fiction originated during the late 1960s, within the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; fan fiction fandom, starting with &quot;Kirk/Spock&quot; stories generally authored by female fans of the series and distributed privately among friends.
The name arises from the use of the slash symbol (/) in mentions in the late &#x27;70s of K/S (meaning stories where Kirk and Spock had a romantic [and often sexual] relationship), as compared to the ampersand (&amp;) conventionally used for K&amp;S or Kirk and Spock &quot;friendship&quot; fiction. For a time, both &quot;slash&quot; and &quot;K/S&quot; (for &quot;Kirk/Spock&quot;) were used interchangeably. Slash later spread to other fan groups, first &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, and &quot;The Professionals&quot;, then many others, eventually creating a fandom based on the concept of slash. Many early slash stories were based on a pairing of two close friends, a &quot;hero dyad&quot;, or &quot;One True Pairing&quot;, such as Kirk/Spock or Starsky/Hutch; conversely, a classic pairing between foils was that of Blake/Avon from &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;.

The first K/S stories were not immediately accepted by all &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans. Later, authors such as Joanna Russ studied and reviewed the phenomenon in essays and gave the genre some academic respectability. Greater subsequent tolerance and acceptance of homosexuality and increased frustration with the portrayal of gay relationships in mainstream media fed a growing desire in authors to explore the subjects on their own terms, using established media characters. &quot;Star Trek&quot; slash fiction remained important to fans, while new slash fiction grew up around other television shows, movies, and books with sci-fi or action-adventure roots.

Early slash fans in England feared that they would be arrested, because slash violated the obscenity laws there at the time.

===Slash sources===
From its earliest days, slash fiction has been particularly inspired by popular speculative fiction franchises, possibly because speculative fiction may lack well-developed female characters or because the speculative elements allow greater freedom to reinterpret canonical characters. However, other large bodies of slash fiction, such as &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; or &quot;The Professionals&quot;, are based on non-speculative sources.

Slash fiction follows popular media, and new stories are constantly produced. There is some correlation between the popularity and activity of each variety of slash fiction and those of the source of the material. Some slash fiction readers and writers tend to adhere closely to the canonical source of their fiction, while other participants may follow the slash content without being fans of the original source material itself.

===Slash on the Internet===
Until the Internet became accessible to the general public in the early 1990s, slash was hard to find. It was published only in fan-edited non-profit fanzines (often called only &quot;zines&quot;), which were usually priced just high enough to recoup printing costs, and were sold via adzines or at conventions. With the advent of the Internet, slash fiction writers created mailing lists which gradually took the place of amateur press associations (APA), and websites such as FanFiction.Net (which gradually started taking the place of zines).

Forum boards and message boards were active during the first half of the first decade of the millennium, and sites such as Angelfire, Geocities, and ProBoards were quite successful. Other venues in which slash was, and still is, published are Facebook and private groups. Much later came Archive of Our Own. As slash publishing gradually moved to the Internet, the field opened to more writers, and a greater quantity of material was published.

The Internet allowed slash authors more freedom than print: stories could include branching story lines, links, collages, song mixes, and other innovations. The Internet increased slash visibility and the number of readers, as readers were now able to access the stories from their own home at a much lower cost, since zines cost more than an Internet connection. The number of fandoms represented increased dramatically, especially those devoted to science fiction, fantasy, and police dramas. The Internet also increased the level of reader interaction, making it easier for fans to comment on stories, give episode reviews, and discuss comment on trends in slash fandom itself. Websites and fanzines dedicated to fans of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; became common, with tens of thousands of slash stories available.

==Critical and queer attention==

Slash fiction has received more academic attention than other genres of fan fiction. Slash fiction was the subject of several notable academic studies in the early 1990s, as part of the cultural studies movement within the humanities: most of these, as is characteristic of cultural studies, approach slash fiction from an ethnographic perspective and talk primarily about the writers of slash fiction and the communities that form around it. Slashers have been configured as fans who resisted culture. Some studies – for example by Italian anthropologist Mirna Ciconi – focus on the textual analysis of slash fiction itself.

Slash fiction was often ignored by queer theorists. However, slash fiction has been described as important to the LGBTQ community and to the formation of queer identities, as it represents a resistance to the expectation of heterosexuality. In a society in which heterosexuality is the norm and homosexuality is highly stigmatized, an online forum is sometimes the only space where young members of the LGBTQ community can be out. Young members of the community all go through a time in which they are still exploring their identity, labels, and pronouns. By writing slash fiction, queer youth can use their favorite characters and stories in order to create scenarios that allow them to explore their feelings, thoughts, and selves. Slash fiction, in this sense, offers queer youth a low-risk chance to explore who they are. They can stay anonymous while creating a world in which they can express themselves creatively and freely. However, slash fiction has also been criticized as being unrepresentative of the gay community as a whole, and as being used as a medium to express feminist frustration with popular and speculative fiction.

The predominant demographic among slash fiction readers is female, the majority of whom identify as other than heterosexual. Science fiction writer Joanna Russ (herself a lesbian), author of &quot;How to Suppress Women&#x27;s Writing&quot;, is one of the first major science fiction writers to take slash fiction and its cultural and literary implications seriously. In her essay &quot;Pornography by Women for Women, with Love,&quot; Russ argues that, in regard to the Kirk/Spock relationship, slash fiction combines both masculine and feminine traits of emotional vulnerability. Such an equal relationship, she contends, negates the power imbalance typically seen in regular fan fiction.

==Definition and ambiguity==
Slash fiction fandoms tend to be diverse and segregated, and each has its own rules of style, etiquette, history, and favorite stories and authors.

Slash cannot be commercially distributed due to copyright laws, and, until the 1990s, it was either undistributed or published in zines. Today, slash fiction is most commonly published on Tumblr, LiveJournal accounts and other websites online, such as Archive Of Our Own. Legal scholars promoting copyright reform sometimes use slash fiction as an example of semiotic democracy.

The term &quot;slash fiction&quot; contains several ambiguities. Due to the lack of canonical homosexual relationships in source media at the time that slash fiction began to emerge, some came to see slash fiction stories as being exclusively outside their respective canons and held that the term &quot;slash fiction&quot; applies only when the characters&#x27; same-sex romantic or erotic relationship about which an author writes is not part of the source&#x27;s canon and that fan fiction about canonical same-sex relationships is therefore not slash. The recent appearance on screen of openly gay and bisexual characters, such as Willow and Tara in the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, the characters of &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, Jack Harkness in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and numerous characters in &quot;Torchwood&quot;, has occasioned much additional discussion of this problem. Abiding by the aforementioned definition leaves such stories without a convenient label, so this distinction has not been widely adopted.

Some slash authors also write slash fiction which contains transgender themes and transgender/transsexual or intersex characters. As a result, the exact definition of the term has often been hotly debated within various slash fandoms. The strictest definition holds that only stories about relationships between two male partners (&#x27;M/M&#x27;) constitute &#x27;slash fiction&#x27;, which has led to the evolution of the term femslash. Slash-like fiction is also written in various Japanese anime or manga fandoms but is commonly referred to as shōnen-ai or yaoi for relationships between male characters, and shōjo-ai or yuri between female characters, respectively.

Due to the increasing popularity and prevalence of slash on the Internet in recent years, some use &quot;slash&quot; as a generic term for any erotic fan fiction, whether it depicts heterosexual or homosexual relationships. This has caused concern for other slash writers, who believe that, while it can be erotic, slash is not, by definition, so, and that defining all erotic fiction as slash makes such fiction unsuitable for potential underage readers of homoromantic fan fiction. In addition, a number of journalists writing about the fan fiction phenomenon in general seem to believe that &quot;all&quot; fan fiction is slash, or at least erotic in character. Such definitions fail to distinguish between erotic and romantic slash, and between slash, het (works focusing primarily on heterosexual relationships) and gen (works which do not include a romantic focus).

The slash mark itself (/), when put between character&#x27;s names, has come to mean a shorthand label for a romantic relationship, regardless of whether the pairing is heterosexual or homosexual, romantic or erotic.

==Slash and the original media sources==
For many people, slash is a controversial subject. In addition to the legal issues associated with traditional fan fiction, some people believe that it tarnishes established media characters to portray them in a way which was never illustrated canonically. But official disapproval of slash, specifically, is hard to find. As early as 1981, Lucasfilm has issued legal notices to fans who wrote sexually explicit stories. J. K. Rowling/Warner Brothers have sent cease and desist letters referencing &quot;sexually explicit&quot; writings on the web, though Rowling approves the writing of fan fiction in general, posting links to fan fiction on her website and openly acknowledging slash fiction while maintaining that pairings such as those between Harry/Draco and Harry/Snape are non-canonical.

Some media creators seem downright slash friendly. In the &quot;Angel&quot; DVD commentary for &quot;A Hole in the World&quot;, Joss Whedon, the creator of &quot;Angel&quot;, said, &quot;Spike and Angel...they were hanging out for years and years and years. They were all kinds of deviant. Are people thinking they never...? Come on, people! They&#x27;re open-minded guys!&quot; as well as Spike saying, &quot;Angel and me have never been intimate. Except that one...&quot; to Illyria in the episode &quot;Power Play.&quot; Renaissance Pictures invited femslash author Melissa Good to pen scripts for &quot;&quot;. Some people say they see similar evidence of such relationships in other shows such as &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot; and &quot;Due South.&quot;

&quot;Due South&#x27;s&quot; fandom was one of the first to go online, after the show debuted in 1994. In 1999 &quot;Due South&quot; creator Paul Haggis participated in a question-and-answer panel with an online &quot;Due South&quot; newsgroup. The newsgroup asked Haggis if he had a problem with fans seeing the characters he created (Detective Ray Vecchio and Constable Benton Fraser) as being in love with each other and having a closeted relationship. Haggis replied, &quot;Absolutely no problem at all. If ever two people loved each other, it&#x27;s Ray and Fraser.&quot;

Furthermore, the YouTubers Daniel Howell and Phil Lester (Daniel Howell and amazingphil) are well known for being very accepting of slash fiction and even wrote some fanfiction about themselves, which was featured in their book &quot;The Amazing Book is Not on Fire&quot;. In addition, their stage show, The Amazing Tour is Not on Fire, included a section called Fanfiction Live.

In the episode &quot;The Monster at the End of This Book&quot; of the TV show &quot;Supernatural&quot;, the main characters encounter fictional representations of themselves in a series of books. They find the online fandom, and comment about their activities including the writing of slash fanfiction. This is often referred to by fans of &quot;Supernatural&quot; as Wincest, based on the characters&#x27; surname (Winchester) and the fact that they are brothers (incest).

The revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; led by the openly gay writer Russell T Davies has also seen nods towards the slash fans beyond the omnisexual Captain Jack Harkness and other characters from the spin-off &quot;Torchwood&quot;. Many fans see exchanges between the Doctor and the Master (played in the new series by John Simm, whose &quot;Life On Mars&quot; character Sam Tyler is also the subject of a lot of slash fiction) as indicative of a previous relationship, or current attraction. At one point the Master says to the Doctor &quot;I like it when you use my name&quot;, and in a Children in Need special, the Tenth Doctor tells the Fifth, after being asked whether the Master still has &quot;that rubbish beard&quot;, &quot;No, no beard this time. Well, a wife.&quot; – which fans point to as a reference to gay men marrying a woman for public respectability, the wife being referred to as &quot;a beard&quot;. The term for shows that seem to be giving material for slash writers to use is &quot;pre-slashed&quot;, sometimes &quot;pre-slashed for your convenience&quot;.

==Slash fandom==

===Conventions===

Several slash conventions run throughout the year and across the globe, mostly in the United States, including Escapade in California, REVELcon in Texas, Connexions in Maryland, MediaWest*Con in Michigan, CON.TXT in Washington, D.C., Con*Strict in Nevada, Connotations in England, Zebracon in Illinois, Yaoi-Con in California, Bascon in California, and others.

===Terminology ===
Slash fiction has created and appropriated words to denote peculiarities found within the fandom. &quot;Gayfic&quot; is sometimes used to refer to stories focusing on gay male relationships, and &quot;femslash&quot; or &quot;f/f&quot; used to indicate that a work features female characters in slash relationships.

Slash fiction, like other fan fiction, sometimes borrows the MPAA film rating system to indicate the amount of sexual content in the story. Not all slash fiction has explicit sexual content – the interaction between two characters can be as innocent as holding hands or a chaste kiss, or even contain nothing but unfulfilled yearning; stories may be labeled &quot;UST&quot; for &quot;unresolved sexual tension&quot;. Some sites require all stories to be rated and have warnings attached, often by using a beta reader.

The term &quot;no lemon&quot; is sometimes used to indicate fan fiction stories without explicit sexual content. Anything with explicit content, especially with erotic scenes without accompanying romantic scenes, may be labeled &quot;lemon&quot;. The term &quot;lemon&quot; arose from the anime/yaoi fandoms, referring to a hentai anime series, &quot;Cream Lemon&quot;. The term &quot;squick&quot; is most often used as a warning to refer to a reader&#x27;s possible negative reaction to scenes in the text (often sexual) that some might find offensive or distressing, such as those including incest, BDSM, rape, &quot;mpreg&quot; (male pregnancy), gender swapping, and torture. The term originated in the Usenet newsgroup alt.sex.bondage in 1991. Squicks are often listed as a warning in the header of a fanfiction story.

The term &quot;slasher&quot; is used for someone who creates slash fiction, and the term &quot;slashy&quot; is used to mean &quot;homoerotic&quot;. &quot;Slashy moments&quot; are those events in the canonical storyline which slashers interpret as homoerotic, which in turn form the slashers&#x27; depiction of the characters in slash fiction.

==Subgenres==

===Femslash===

Femslash or femmeslash is a subgenre of slash fiction which focuses on romantic and/or sexual relationships between female fictional characters. Typically, characters featured in femslash are heterosexual in the canonical universe; however, similar fan fiction about lesbian characters are commonly labeled as femslash for convenience. The term is generally applied only to fanworks based on Western fandoms; the nearest anime/manga equivalents are more often called yuri and shōjo-ai fanfiction. Femslash is also known as &quot;f/f slash&quot;, &quot;femmeslash&quot;, and &quot;saffic&quot;, the last term blending the words &quot;Sapphic&quot; and &quot;fiction&quot;.

There is less femslash than there is slash based on male couples – it has been suggested that heterosexual female slash authors generally do not write femslash, and that it is rare to find a fandom with two sufficiently engaging female characters. Janeway/Seven is the main &quot;Star Trek&quot; femslash pairing, as only they have &quot;an on-screen relationship fraught with deep emotional connection and conflict&quot;. Although it is debated whether fanfiction about canonical lesbians such as Willow and Tara of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; counts as &quot;slash&quot;, their relationship storylines are more coy than heterosexual ones, which entices Willow/Tara femslash authors to fill in the gaps in the known relationship storyline. It is &quot;relatively recently&quot; that male writers have begun writing femslash.

Another suggestion in which there is less femslash is its lack of strong female characters in media. TV shows are heavily skewed toward the portrayal of men, with only two notable predominant female TV shows: &quot;&quot; and &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot;. In these two cases, because there is an overwhelming number of strong female characters, femslash is much more popular. Otherwise, shows with a skew towards men are more popular, as women portrayed in these shows are weaker supporting characters.

===Chanslash===

Chanslash is the portrayal of underage characters in sexual situations in slash fiction. The prefix chan most likely comes from the Japanese name suffix used as a term of endearment toward children or women. It may be a nod towards yaoi fandoms, in which underage pairings are more commonplace. Owners of the intellectual property rights to characters in this type of slash are often unhappy with chanslash because of the potential legal ramifications and concern over negatively affecting the popularity of the character. Some studios owning the rights to slashed characters have issued cease and desist orders in the past as a result of this type of slash. Chanslash is also called shotacon (abbreviated as &quot;shouta&quot; or &quot;shota&quot;) when dealing with anime fanfiction.

===Real person slash===
Real person slash (RPS), also a subgenre of real person fiction, involves taking a celebrity&#x27;s public image and creating slash stories with them. Real person slash gained popularity with the 1990s rise of boy bands in the pop music industry. In the &quot;Supernatural&quot; fandom, slash fans who were uncomfortable with shipping the two main brother characters moved into writing and reading Jsquared/J2 fic (slash involving the lead actors Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles). This led to the phrase &quot;Supernatural fandom – where RPS is the moral high ground&quot;. Though increasingly common, RPS is considered a potential &quot;squick&quot; for slash readers. In addition, the use of celebrities in fictional, sexual stories remains controversial. Journals including RPS often include disclaimers that explain their true fictional nature. Henry Jenkins says that RPS may be &quot;troubling&quot; to the old guard of slash. Fans of real person slash state that the personas presented by the common figures of RPS such as boy bands, celebrities, athletes and pro wrestlers are &quot;largely manufactured&quot; for the pleasure of female fans, &quot;so why not just run with them?&quot;

===Reverse slash===
Reverse slash is a term used for fanfic without any sexual content, or very little sexual content, compared to the canon. The term is believed to have originated when non-sexual fanfic based on the Anita Blake series began to circulate. Fanfic without sexual content can also be referred to as &#x27;genfic&#x27;, short for general fiction, non-romantic in nature.

===Original slash===
Original slash stories are those that contain male/male content, based on perceived homoerotic subtext between fictitious characters. This can be sourced from a variety of media content, such as manga, TV shows, movies and books amongst others. These works are now generally published online and use the same forms of rating, warnings and terminology that is commonly used by slash writers.

Slash has a different sensibility to gay fiction, probably because most slash readers are female and in a closed community that shares their tastes, which makes most stories in the genre centered into emotional relationships, even as sex is very prominent.

A different variety of homoerotic amateur fiction is original yaoi, from the manga/anime genre yaoi (boy-love), popularized in the West by subbers and scanlations.

Both (original slash and original yaoi) are terms that are considered somewhat controversial by some slash fans since they feel that the term &#x27;slash&#x27; can only refer to works of fan fiction and not original works.

===Omegaverse===

Omegaverse is a subgenre of speculative erotic fiction that originated as a subgenre of slash fiction. In Omegaverse works, humans are either dominant &quot;alphas&quot;, neutral &quot;betas&quot; or submissive &quot;omegas&quot;, and they exhibit sexual traits and behaviors based on those of wolves or other wild animals. The first Omegaverse slash fiction was written about the TV series &quot;Supernatural&quot; in the 2010s. The subgenre has become so popular that it evolved into a genre of original erotic fiction in its own right, independent from its roots in fan fiction. The earliest commercial publication using omegaverse tropes is &quot;With Caution&quot; by J.L. Langley. The trope gained rapid popularity in Japan in the mid-2010s through fan &quot;dōjinshi&quot; and has become a subgenre of &quot;yaoi&quot; works. In Japanese works, Omegaverse also introduces a caste system, where Alphas are depicted as the upper class elites while Omegas are at the bottom tier and face discrimination. Omegas can get pregnant in spite of being male.

==Other slash fanworks==

===Slash art===

In addition to fiction, fans also create artwork depicting media characters in same-sex relationship contexts. Initially, slash art was mostly used in covers and interior pages of fanzines, and sold to other fans at media and slash conventions.

=== Slash manips ===
In recent years, more slash artwork has used widespread availability of imaging software, like Adobe Photoshop, to manipulate photographs of their subjects to produce romantic or erotic images (often referred to as &quot;slash manips&quot;) which imply a homosexual relationship, either as static pictures or animated GIFs. When the manipulated photos depict real people instead of media characters, the creation of these images can be as contentious as real person slash, and for many of the same reasons.

===Slash vidding===
Vidding has existed in media fandom since the 1980s, and slash vidding is still a popular movement within vidding. Slash vidders take clips of characters (generally ones not written as gay, or in a relationship together), and through juxtaposition, song choice, and other techniques, portray a slash relationship on screen. Vidding used to be very guarded within the slash community, among other reasons, because the songs used in videos are copyrighted. When vidders started putting their videos online, their sites were routinely password protected, etc.

Today, there are thousands of vids, and vid-like projects, available on YouTube and other video sites. Many of these vids are made by slash (and gen) fans, but enormous numbers of them are made by people who have never heard of media fandom. The previous secrecy of vidding fans has come to seem unnecessary, but there is still a community ethos of not freely giving out a vidder&#x27;s URL.

===Slash roleplay===
Sometimes referred to as &quot;yaoi&quot; (male/male) or &quot;yuri&quot; (female/female), roleplay involving same-sex characters in relationships can be either with canonical or original character creations. There are slash roleplaying based on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and &quot;Dragon Age&quot;, among others.

There are many mediums used to approach the act of internet roleplaying including message boards, AIM, IRC and specially created chatrooms on servers. Some roleplay is very strict and requires players to be able to type a paragraph or two per each turn, some use strict guidelines involving roleplay dice and some are combinations of all of the above.

Not every roleplay community accepts slash, however, and some people specifically disallow the use of it in their community as not being canonical or simply the operators do not care for slash.

<text>Raka-maomao or Rakamaomao, in Māori mythology, is a god of wind. He is the god of ordinary winds, in contrast to Tāwhirimātea, who is the god of tempests. To the Waitaha tribe of the South Island, Rakamaomao was the group of winds that blew from the south and north.

Raka-maomao is equivalent to Ra‘a (Society Islands), Raka (Cook Islands), La&#x27;a Maomao (Hawaii) and Fa&#x27;atiu (Samoa).

<text>In Māori mythology, Rongomai refers to several entities:

* a deity by whose assistance Haungaroa traveled from Hawaiki to New Zealand as she went to tell Ngātoro-i-rangi that he had been cursed by Manaia.
* a being in whale form which attacked and almost wiped out the war-party of Maru.
* a god of comet.
* the war god of the tribes in the Lake Taupō region.
* a celebrated demi-god ancestor of some iwi. He went with Ihinga and others of his friends to visit the dread Miru in her abode in the underworld. There they were taught incantations, witchcraft, religious songs, dances, and certain games. One of Rongomai&#x27;s men was caught, and was claimed by Miru in sacrifice, as payment for having imparted the sacred knowledge, but Rongomai and the others got safely back to the world again.
* the chief of the Mahuhu canoe in its voyage from Hawaiki to New Zealand. He was drowned when the canoe overturned, and his body was eaten by the araara fish, since held sacred by the Ngā Puhi and Rarawa iwi, who claim descent from Rongomai. Until they embraced Christianity, those iwi would not eat the araara (or trevally, &quot;Caranx georianus&quot;) .
* a meteor or comet, seen in the full light of day when in comparatively recent times, the Ngāti Hau tribe were besieging the fortress named Rangiuru at Ōtaki, occupied by the Ngāti Awa.Ronngomai can mean princess or sunshine said in many Māori dictionaries and the big book of names.

<text>In Māori mythology, Rūaumoko (also known as Rūamoko) is the god of earthquakes, volcanoes and seasons. He is the youngest son of Ranginui (the Sky father) and Papatūānuku (the Earth mother) (commonly called Rangi and Papa).

Ruaumoko Patera, named after this god, is one of many paterae (shallow craters) on Io, one of Jupiter&#x27;s moons.

==Origin story==
After Rangi and Papa were separated by their sons, Rangi cried, and his tears drenched the land. To stop this, the sons decided to turn Papa face down, so Rangi and Papa could no longer see each other&#x27;s sorrow. Rūaumoko was at his mother&#x27;s breast when this happened, so he was carried into the world below. He was given fire for warmth die by Tama-kaka, and his movements below the earth cause earthquakes and volcanoes. Another version tells that he remains in Papa&#x27;s womb, with some variants saying it was to keep Papa company after her separation from Rangi. In these versions, his movements in the womb cause earthquakes.

The earthquakes Rūaumoko causes are in turn responsible for the change of seasons. Depending on the time of year, the earthquakes cause the warmth, or cold, of Papa to come to the surface of the land, resulting in the warming, or cooling of the Earth.

Rūaumoko pulls on the ropes that control the land causing the shimmering effect of hot air, called haka of Tane-rore, and in some versions, earthquakes.

In some traditions, Rūaumoko creates the Auckland volcanic field alongside his brother Mataaho, in retribution for a war between two rival tribes of patupaiarehe.

<text>In the mythology of Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Tikokura is a sea-dwelling evil spirit in the shape of a storm wave.

Ngaru determined to try his strength against Tikokura and his shark-like companion, Tumuitearetoka. He provided himself with a surfboard named Orua (the two). Ngaru went to the edge of the reef and called out insults against the two demons, who promptly appeared to exact revenge. A huge smashed over the reef, and Ngaru let himself be washed out to sea.

Tumuitearetoka saw his chance to strike, but Moko, Ngaru&#x27;s grandfather, was sitting on a high rock and called out &quot;The shark is below you!&quot; The wave and the shark kept attacking, but each time Moko warned his grandson, who was able to outwit them and live on. After eight days and nights, Ngaru threw his surfboard to the monsters, who gladly retired to their home in the deep, while Ngaru went off to find Tongatea, his wife (Gill 1876:225-227).

<text>In Polynesian mythology, stories about Tinirau are found throughout the islands of Polynesia. He is a guardian of fish. Many themes recur in the various versions. Often he travels to another land in search of his wife, or his wife travels to another land in search of him; sometimes he treats his wife badly, or she rejects him; while he is guardian of fish, it is his wife who gives the fish their individual characteristics. Sometimes their anxious or jealous relatives try to separate the lovers (Tremewan 2002:120).

In some traditions, he has a dual nature; one destructive as the guardian of sharks, and one a kind, handsome male youth; in others, his right side is human and his left side is a fish. Alternate names in the various Polynesian languages include [[Kinilau]], Sinilau, Tigilau, and Tinilau.

==In Samoa==
Stories about Tinilau (or Tigilau) and his wife Sina are very popular in Samoa. There are numerous legends, and much variation in the tellings (Tremewan 2002:157). Here are some examples:

* Tinilau lends his two turtles to ‘Ae, a Tongan. When he gets home, ‘Ae kills the turtles and has a great feast for his people. When a bloody wave washes up on the beach, Tinilau calls a meeting of all the avenging gods of Savaii. The gods go to Tonga and pick &#x27;Ae up, and return him to the house of Tinilau. When ‘Ae wakes up, he hears the rooster crowing, and it reminds him of the one he heard when he was staying with Tinilau. &#x27;Ae, not knowing that he is in Tinilau&#x27;s house, begins talking about “the pig, my master”. At once he is killed and eaten (Tregear 1891:110, Tremewan 2002:157).
* ‘Ae of Tonga comes to visit Tigilau and returns with Tigilau&#x27;s two turtles, Toga, whom he kills, and Utuutu, who gets away. A demon named Supa catches ‘Ae and brings him back to Samoa to be killed by Tigilau (Tremewan 2002:157).
*Sina rejects offers of marriage from the kings of Tonga and Fiji, instead seeking out Tigilau, who lives with his many wives. One day, Tigilau goes out fishing, and one of the jealous wives steals Sina&#x27;s soul. To get it back, Tigilau travels to the sun (Tremewan 2002:157).
* The fish for the wedding feast of Sina and Tigilau are swallowed by one of Tigilau&#x27;s other wives. Tigilau blames Sina and banishes her to the forest with two servants. When he hears what has happened to his sister, Lupe flies to her home, his arrival throwing the whole land into shadow. He presents fine mats as gifts for her wedding. Sina sings a song complaining about her harsh treatment, asking to be taken away. Tigilau overhears and kills his wives, telling Lupe that he wants Sina to return to him. When he visits his son in a house near to Sina&#x27;s, he becomes jealous when he sees how many suitors are visiting Sina. At last, Sina returns to live with Tigilau for her son&#x27;s sake (Tremewan 2002:157).

Motutapu is given to him as his inheritance. He is guardian of all fish. Tumetua, Vatea, and others are his brothers (Tregear 1891:513).

<doc id="96558" wikidata="Q212397" url="?curid=96558" title="Maxwell's demon">
<text>Maxwell&#x27;s demon is a thought experiment that appears to disprove the second law of thermodynamics. It was proposed by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1867. In his first letter, Maxwell referred to the entity as a &quot;finite being&quot; or a &quot;being who can play a game of skill with the molecules&quot;. Lord Kelvin would later call it a &quot;demon&quot;. 

In the thought experiment, a demon controls a door between two chambers containing gas. As individual gas molecules (or atoms) approach the door, the demon quickly opens and closes the door to allow only fast-moving molecules to pass through in one direction, and only slow-moving molecules to pass through in the other. Because the kinetic temperature of a gas depends on the velocities of its constituent molecules, the demon&#x27;s actions cause one chamber to warm up and the other to cool down. This would decrease the total entropy of the system, seemingly without applying any work, thereby violating the second law of thermodynamics.

The concept of Maxwell&#x27;s demon has provoked substantial debate in the philosophy of science and theoretical physics, which continues to the present day. It stimulated work on the relationship between thermodynamics and information theory. Most scientists argue that, on theoretical grounds, no practical device can violate the second law in this way. Other researchers have implemented forms of Maxwell&#x27;s demon in experiments, though they all differ from the thought experiment to some extent and none has been shown to violate the second law.

== Origin and history of the idea ==
The thought experiment first appeared in a letter Maxwell wrote to Peter Guthrie Tait on 11 December 1867. It appeared again in a letter to John William Strutt in 1871, before it was presented to the public in Maxwell&#x27;s 1872 book on thermodynamics titled &quot;Theory of Heat&quot;.

In his letters and books, Maxwell described the agent opening the door between the chambers as a &quot;finite being&quot;. Being a deeply religious man, he never used the word &quot;demon&quot;. Instead, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) was the first to use it for Maxwell&#x27;s concept, in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; in 1874, and implied that he intended the Greek mythology interpretation of a daemon, a supernatural being working in the background, rather than a malevolent being.

== Original thought experiment ==
The second law of thermodynamics ensures (through statistical probability) that two bodies of different temperature, when brought into contact with each other and isolated from the rest of the Universe, will evolve to a thermodynamic equilibrium in which both bodies have approximately the same temperature. The second law is also expressed as the assertion that in an isolated system, entropy never decreases.

Maxwell conceived a thought experiment as a way of furthering the understanding of the second law. His description of the experiment is as follows:

In other words, Maxwell imagines one container divided into two parts, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Both parts are filled with the same gas at equal temperatures and placed next to each other. Observing the molecules on both sides, an imaginary demon guards a trapdoor between the two parts. When a faster-than-average molecule from &quot;A&quot; flies towards the trapdoor, the demon opens it, and the molecule will fly from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;. Likewise, when a slower-than-average molecule from &quot;B&quot; flies towards the trapdoor, the demon will let it pass from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;A&quot;. The average speed of the molecules in &quot;B&quot; will have increased while in &quot;A&quot; they will have slowed down on average. Since average molecular speed corresponds to temperature, the temperature decreases in &quot;A&quot; and increases in &quot;B&quot;, contrary to the second law of thermodynamics. A heat engine operating between the thermal reservoirs &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; could extract useful work from this temperature difference.

The demon must allow molecules to pass in both directions in order to produce only a temperature difference; one-way passage only of faster-than-average molecules from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; will cause higher temperature and pressure to develop on the &quot;B&quot; side.

== Criticism and development ==
Several physicists have presented calculations that show that the second law of thermodynamics will not actually be violated, if a more complete analysis is made of the whole system including the demon. The essence of the physical argument is to show, by calculation, that any demon must &quot;generate&quot; more entropy segregating the molecules than it could ever eliminate by the method described. That is, it would take more thermodynamic work to gauge the speed of the molecules and selectively allow them to pass through the opening between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; than the amount of energy gained by the difference of temperature caused by doing so.

One of the most famous responses to this question was suggested in 1929 by Leó Szilárd, and later by Léon Brillouin. Szilárd pointed out that a real-life Maxwell&#x27;s demon would need to have some means of measuring molecular speed, and that the act of acquiring information would require an expenditure of energy. Since the demon and the gas are interacting, we must consider the total entropy of the gas and the demon combined. The expenditure of energy by the demon will cause an increase in the entropy of the demon, which will be larger than the lowering of the entropy of the gas.

In 1960, Rolf Landauer raised an exception to this argument. He realized that some measuring processes need not increase thermodynamic entropy as long as they were thermodynamically reversible. He suggested these &quot;reversible&quot; measurements could be used to sort the molecules, violating the Second Law. However, due to the connection between entropy in thermodynamics and information theory, this also meant that the recorded measurement must not be erased. In other words, to determine whether to let a molecule through, the demon must acquire information about the state of the molecule and either discard it or store it. Discarding it leads to immediate increase in entropy, but the demon cannot store it indefinitely. In 1982, Charles Bennett showed that, however well prepared, eventually the demon will run out of information storage space and must begin to erase the information it has previously gathered. Erasing information is a thermodynamically irreversible process that increases the entropy of a system. Although Bennett had reached the same conclusion as Szilard&#x27;s 1929 paper, that a Maxwellian demon could not violate the second law because entropy would be created, he had reached it for different reasons. Regarding Landauer&#x27;s principle, the minimum energy dissipated by deleting information was experimentally measured by Eric Lutz &quot;et al.&quot; in 2012. Furthermore, Lutz &quot;et al.&quot; confirmed that in order to approach the Landauer&#x27;s limit, the system must asymptotically approach zero processing speed.
Recently, Landauer&#x27;s principle has also been invoked to resolve an apparently unrelated paradox of statistical physics, Loschmidt’s paradox. 

John Earman and John D. Norton have argued that Szilárd and Landauer&#x27;s explanations of Maxwell&#x27;s demon begin by assuming that the second law of thermodynamics cannot be violated by the demon, and derive further properties of the demon from this assumption, including the necessity of consuming energy when erasing information, etc. It would therefore be circular to invoke these derived properties to defend the second law from the demonic argument. Bennett later acknowledged the validity of Earman and Norton&#x27;s argument, while maintaining that Landauer&#x27;s principle explains the mechanism by which real systems do not violate the second law of thermodynamics.

== Recent progress ==
Although the argument by Landauer and Bennett only answers the consistency between the second law of thermodynamics and the whole cyclic process of the entire system of a Szilard engine (a composite system of the engine and the demon), a recent approach based on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics for small fluctuating systems has provided deeper insight on each information process with each subsystem. From this viewpoint, the measurement process is regarded as a process where the correlation (mutual information) between the engine and the demon increases, decreasing the entropy of the system in an amount given by the mutual information. If the correlation changes, thermodynamic relations such as the second law of thermodynamics and the fluctuation theorem for each subsystem should be modified, and for the case of external control a second-law like inequality and a generalized fluctuation theorem with mutual information are satisfied. For more general information processes including biological information processing, both inequality and equality with mutual information hold. When repeated measurements are performed, the entropy reduction of the system is given by the entropy of the sequence of measurements, which takes into account the reduction of information due to the correlation between the measurements.

== Applications ==
Real-life versions of Maxwellian demons occur, but all such &quot;real demons&quot; or molecular demons have their entropy-lowering effects duly balanced by increase of entropy elsewhere. Molecular-sized mechanisms are no longer found only in biology; they are also the subject of the emerging field of nanotechnology. Single-atom traps used by particle physicists allow an experimenter to control the state of individual quanta in a way similar to Maxwell&#x27;s demon.

If hypothetical mirror matter exists, Zurab Silagadze proposes that demons can be envisaged, &quot;which can act like perpetuum mobiles of the second kind: extract heat energy from only one reservoir, use it to do work and be isolated from the rest of ordinary world. Yet the Second Law is not violated because the demons pay their entropy cost in the hidden (mirror) sector of the world by emitting mirror photons.&quot;

== Experimental work ==
In 2007, David Leigh announced the creation of a nano-device based on the Brownian ratchet popularized by Richard Feynman. Leigh&#x27;s device is able to drive a chemical system out of equilibrium, but it must be powered by an external source (light in this case) and therefore does not violate thermodynamics.

Previously, researchers including Nobel Prize winner Fraser Stoddart had created ring-shaped molecules called rotaxanes which could be placed on an axle connecting two sites, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Particles from either site would bump into the ring and move it from end to end. If a large collection of these devices were placed in a system, half of the devices had the ring at site &quot;A&quot; and half at &quot;B&quot;, at any given moment in time.

Leigh made a minor change to the axle so that if a light is shone on the device, the center of the axle will thicken, restricting the motion of the ring. It keeps the ring from moving, however, only if it is at &quot;A&quot;. Over time, therefore, the rings will be bumped from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;A&quot; and get stuck there, creating an imbalance in the system. In his experiments, Leigh was able to take a pot of &quot;billions of these devices&quot; from 50:50 equilibrium to a 70:30 imbalance within a few minutes.

In 2009, Mark G. Raizen developed a laser atomic cooling technique which realizes the process Maxwell envisioned of sorting individual atoms in a gas into different containers based on their energy. The new concept is a one-way wall for atoms or molecules that allows them to move in one direction, but not go back. The operation of the one-way wall relies on an irreversible atomic and molecular process of absorption of a photon at a specific wavelength, followed by spontaneous emission to a different internal state. The irreversible process is coupled to a conservative force created by magnetic fields and/or light. Raizen and collaborators proposed using the one-way wall in order to reduce the entropy of an ensemble of atoms. In parallel, Gonzalo Muga and Andreas Ruschhaupt independently developed a similar concept. Their &quot;atom diode&quot; was not proposed for cooling, but rather for regulating the flow of atoms. The Raizen Group demonstrated significant cooling of atoms with the one-way wall in a series of experiments in 2008. Subsequently, the operation of a one-way wall for atoms was demonstrated by Daniel Steck and collaborators later in 2008. Their experiment was based on the 2005 scheme for the one-way wall, and was not used for cooling. The cooling method realized by the Raizen Group was called &quot;single-photon cooling&quot;, because only one photon on average is required in order to bring an atom to near-rest. This is in contrast to other laser cooling techniques which use the momentum of the photon and require a two-level cycling transition.

In 2006, Raizen, Muga, and Ruschhaupt showed in a theoretical paper that as each atom crosses the one-way wall, it scatters one photon, and information is provided about the turning point and hence the energy of that particle. The entropy increase of the radiation field scattered from a directional laser into a random direction is exactly balanced by the entropy reduction of the atoms as they are trapped by the one-way wall.

This technique is widely described as a &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s demon&quot; because it realizes Maxwell&#x27;s process of creating a temperature difference by sorting high and low energy atoms into different containers. However, scientists have pointed out that it does not violate the second law of thermodynamics, does not result in a net decrease in entropy, and cannot be used to produce useful energy. This is because the process requires more energy from the laser beams than could be produced by the temperature difference generated. The atoms absorb low entropy photons from the laser beam and emit them in a random direction, thus increasing the entropy of the environment.

In 2014, Pekola et al. demonstrated an experimental realization of a Szilárd engine. Only a year later and based on an earlier theoretical proposal, the same group presented the first experimental realization of an autonomous Maxwell&#x27;s demon, which extracts microscopic information from a system and reduces its entropy by applying feedback. The demon is based on two capacitively coupled single-electron devices, both integrated on the same electronic circuit. The operation of the demon is directly observed as a temperature drop in the system, with a simultaneous temperature rise in the demon arising from the thermodynamic cost of generating the mutual information. In 2016, Pekola et al. demonstrated a proof-of-principle of an autonomous demon in coupled single-electron circuits, showing a way to cool critical elements in a circuit with information as a fuel. Pekola et al. have also proposed that a simple qubit circuit, e.g., made of a superconducting circuit, could provide a basis to study a quantum Szilard&#x27;s engine.

== As metaphor ==
Daemons in computing, generally processes that run on servers to respond to users, are named for Maxwell&#x27;s demon.

Historian Henry Brooks Adams, in his manuscript &quot;The Rule of Phase Applied to History&quot;, attempted to use Maxwell&#x27;s demon as a historical metaphor, though he misunderstood and misapplied the original principle. Adams interpreted history as a process moving towards &quot;equilibrium&quot;, but he saw militaristic nations (he felt Germany pre-eminent in this class) as tending to reverse this process, a Maxwell&#x27;s demon of history. Adams made many attempts to respond to the criticism of his formulation from his scientific colleagues, but the work remained incomplete at his death in 1918 and was published posthumously.

<text>Tū-te-wehiwehi (also Tū-te-wanawana) is the father of all reptiles in Māori mythology.

== Family ==
He is a son of Punga and brother of Ikatere. Punga&#x27;s father was Tangaroa, atua of the sea.

When Tāwhirimātea made war against his brothers for separating Rangi and Papa, Ikatere and Tū-te-wehiwehi had to flee, and Ikatere fled to the sea and became an ancestor of fishes, while Tū-te-wehiwehi took refuge in the forest and fathered lizards. Before Tū-te-wehiwehi and Ikatere fled, they disputed together as to what they should do to escape from the storms.

One of Tu-te-wanwana&#x27;s offspring was Uenuku, a lesser reptile atua. His mother was Mairangi, who was the daughter of Kauika, son of Wareware, son of Murirangawhenua and Mahuika. This Uenuku should not be confused with Uenuku, a more prominent atua.

<text>In the Micronesian mythology of Kiribati (formerly the Gilbert Islands) Uekera is a tree that reaches to the heavens; &quot;Te Kaintikuaba&quot; which is translated as the &quot;tree of life&quot; or &quot;tree of knowledge&quot; in Kiribati legend. It is said to have been planted in Buariki village in North Tarawa by Nei Tekanuea. The creation story is that spirits who lived in &quot;Te Kaintikuaba&quot; in Samoa, migrated northward carrying branches from the tree and created the islands of Tungaru (the Gilberts). It is the inspiration for the name of the Kiribati weekly newspaper, &quot;Te Uekera&quot;.

<doc id="96570" wikidata="Q7880817" url="?curid=96570" title="Ulupoka">
<text>In Polynesian mythology, Ulupoka is the god of evil and demons. According to legend, during a great battle between the gods, Ulupoka was beheaded by the other gods, but due to his divine nature, he did not die. The gods took Ulupoka&#x27;s head and hid it, leaving his body behind. For centuries, his body has been wandering around, causing death, disease, mischief, and misfortune.

== Story ==
When Milu, the Polynesian god of the Underworld, encountered Ulupoka&#x27;s body (the first time he had seen Ulupoka since he had been beheaded), he promised Ulupoka that he would help him reunite with his head if Milu would allow him to use Ulupoka&#x27;s body to take control of the Hawaiian Islands in revenge against the goddess Pele, who had imprisoned him for centuries. Ulupoka accepted this offer and joined Milu&#x27;s takeover of Hawaii, leading the forces of evil against the Hawaiian troops and people.

Weeks after Milu captured the Hawaiian Islands, he and his army, including Ulupoka, were heavily defeated by the military forces of the nations around the Pacific Ocean and Pele&#x27;s army. As a result, Ulupoka became angry with Milu and left him, instead traveling all over the Pacific Islands in search of his head once again, making the islanders sick with his body.

Ulupoka fought the other gods several times, usually resulting in him being pushed back into the ocean or making everyone around him sick so he could escape. He hates humans, seeing them as weak and shallow beings who foolishly take pride in their heads, which are nothing more than symbols of their ignorance and emptiness.

Today, Ulupoka continues to search for his own head, spreading evil and disease wherever he goes in pursuit of it. He is against humans, their morality, and their love. He sees himself as a &#x27;wounded god&#x27; who should not be underestimated. He is eager to spread any evil or use demons to attack others. Milu once again offers his help to Ulupoka, who, weary from searching for his head, accepts the offer again. This time, he plans to find his own head before he invades more &#x27;stupid islands&#x27;.

It is said that Ulupoka&#x27;s head still seeks his body today, biting the necks and heads of sleeping people, bringing sickness and death in its wake. His head is known to travel at the speed of hurricane winds across the Pacific region in search of his body.

<doc id="96571" wikidata="Q274569" url="?curid=96571" title="Upolu">
<text>Upolu is an island in Samoa, formed by a massive basaltic shield volcano which rises from the seafloor of the western Pacific Ocean. The island is long and in area, making it the second largest of the Samoan Islands by area. With approximately 145,000 inhabitants, it is by far the most populous of the Samoan Islands. Upolu is situated to the southeast of Savai&#x27;i, the &quot;big island&quot;. Apia, the capital, is in the middle of the north coast, and Faleolo International Airport at the western end of the island. The island has not had any historically recorded eruptions, although there is evidence of three lava flows, dating back only to between a few hundred and a few thousand years ago.

In the Samoan branch of Polynesian mythology, Upolu was the first woman on the island.

James Michener based his character Bloody Mary in &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot; (later a major character in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, &quot;South Pacific&quot;) on the owner of Aggie Grey&#x27;s Hotel on the south end of the island. She was still running the hotel in 1960. A branch was later opened in Apia, overlooking the harbor.

==History==
In 1841, the island was the site of the Bombardment of Upolu, an incident during the United States Exploring Expedition.

In the late 19th century, the Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson owned a estate in the village of Vailima in Upolu. He died there in 1894 and is buried at the top of Mount Vaea overlooking his former estate. The Vailima estate was purchased in 1900 to serve as the official residence for the German governor of German Samoa. When the British/Dominion took over governance of the islands, they confiscated the estate and put it to the same use. It later served as the residence for the New Zealand administrator and, after independence, for the Samoan head of state. During World War II, the US Navy built Naval Base Upolu on the island.

===2009 Samoa tsunami===

The island of Upolu was hit by a tsunami at 06:48:11 local time on 29 September 2009 (17:48:11 UTC). Twenty villages on Upolu&#x27;s south side were reportedly destroyed, including Lepā, the home of Samoa&#x27;s prime minister, Tuila&#x27;epa Sa&#x27;ilele Malielegaoi. In Lepā, only the church and the village&#x27;s welcome sign remained standing after the disaster.

===2024 HMNZS &quot;Manawanui&quot; sinking===

On 5 October 2024, the Royal New Zealand Navy ship HMNZS &quot;Manawanui&quot; ran aground and sunk off the coast of Siumu on the southern coast of Upolu. The &quot;Manawanui&quot; had been surveying a nearby reef and was caught up in a storm. The sinking of the &quot;Manawanui&quot; polluted the surrounding sea and disrupted the livelihoods of local communities in the Safata district, who were unable to fish due to restrictions around the wreckage site. The Samoan and New Zealand authorities were criticised by local villagers for a lack of compensation and engagement with local communities. This led local villagers to seek financial assistance from the Chinese Embassy in Apia.

On 12 February 2025, the Samoan Government lifted a &quot;precautionary zone&quot; around the wreckage of the HMNZS &quot;Manawanui&quot; following testing by the Scientific Research Organisation of Samoa (SROS). However, a two km prohibition zone around the sunken ship remained in force.

==Wildlife==
An extremely small species of spider lives on Upolu. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the spider is the size of a period (full stop) on a printed page.

==Depictions in popular culture==
Upolu was the filming location for the 1953 South Seas film &quot;Return to Paradise&quot;, starring Gary Cooper.

The island was also the filming location for several seasons of several editions of the competition reality television series, &quot;Survivor&quot;. This included:

* Five seasons of &quot;Australian Survivor&quot;: the 3rd season in 2016 and the 4th season in 2017; &quot;Australian Survivor: Heroes vs Villains&quot; in 2023 (10th season); &quot;Australian Survivor: Titans vs Rebels&quot; in 2024 (11th season); and &quot;Australian Survivor: Brains vs Brawn II&quot; in 2025 (12th season).
* Four seasons of the &quot;American version&quot; of &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;&quot; (19th season); &quot;&quot; (20th season); &quot;&quot; (23rd season); and &quot;&quot; (24th season). 
* One season of &quot;Survivor South Africa&quot;: &quot;Survivor South Africa: Island of Secrets&quot; (7th season) in 2019.

<text>In the education system of New Zealand, a wānanga is a publicly-owned tertiary institution or Māori university that provides education in a Māori cultural context. Section 162 of the New Zealand Education Act of 1989 specifies that wānanga resemble mainstream universities in many ways but expects them to be:
:... characterised by teaching and research that maintains, advances, and disseminates knowledge and develops intellectual independence, and assists the application of knowledge regarding āhuatanga Māori (Māori tradition) according to tikanga Māori (Māori custom).

Wānanga educational programmes, accredited through the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) and through the Ministry of Education, are partly governed by New Zealand&#x27;s Tertiary Education Commission (TEC). Wānanga offer certificates, diplomas, and bachelor-level degrees, with some wānanga providing programmes in specialized areas up to doctorate level.

Outside the 21st-century formal education system, the word &quot;wānanga&quot; in the Māori language traditionally conveys meanings related to highly evolved knowledge, lore, occult arts,
and also – in the sense of a discussion to arrive at deeper understanding.

The Education and Training Act 2020 underwent proposed amendments to better recognize the role of wānanga in New Zealand’s tertiary education system. These changes focused on providing a new framework for the country’s three current wānanga: Te Wānanga o Aotearoa, Te Wānanga o Raukawa, and Te Whare Wānanga Awanuiārangi.

The term &quot;Whare Wānanga&quot; is also widely used in the Māori names of New Zealand universities (e.g., Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato/University of Waikato).

==Recognised wānanga==
* Te Wānanga o Raukawa, founded in 1981 and based in Ōtaki 
* Te Wānanga o Aotearoa, founded in 1984, operating nationwide and headquartered in Te Awamutu
* Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiārangi, founded in 1991 and based in Whakatāne

<text>The Karakum Desert ( ; ), also spelt &#x27; and &#x27; (; ), is a desert in Central Asia. The name refers to the shale-rich sand beneath the surface. It occupies about 70 percent, or roughly , of Turkmenistan.

The population is sparse, with an average of one person per . Rainfall is also rare, ranging from per year.

==Geography==
The desert covers roughly seventy percent of Turkmenistan, a long east–west swath. It sits east of the Caspian Sea which has a steep east bank. It adjoins, to the north, the long delta feeding the South Aral Sea further north, another endorheic lake, about higher than the Caspian Sea. The delta is that of the Amu Darya river to the northeast, demarcating the long border with the Kyzylkum Desert of Uzbekistan. The desert is divided into three regions, the elevated northern Trans-Unguz Karakum, the low-lying Central Karakum, and the southeastern Karakum, home to a chain of salt marshes. Since the early 1980s, the relatively small desert extension, the Aralkum, has come to occupy most of the former seabed of the Aral Sea, about . The sea has fluctuated over millennia, but its majority loss during the Soviet Union&#x27;s existence coincided with great irrigation projects. The North Aral Sea was partly restored, but the South Aral Sea ebbed to a small-size stasis at its river mouth, which itself dried up by 2014, leaving only fragments of the former sea behind, such as Barsakelmes Lake. 

Within the north-west edge of the desert used to be a river. In the late Pleistocene, the Amu Darya used to flow beyond the Aral Basin to Sarykamysh Lake then to the Caspian Sea. Sedimentation and floods during a pluvial period led to overflow to the Zeravshan River valley to the east. The two flows merged and formed or expanded Horezm Lake, which had been formed by the earlier Khvalinian period, and as it overflowed northwards it carved its link with the Aral Sea along the Akcha Dar&#x27;ya population corridor of that low, gentle valley (a remote community of Western Uzbekistan and north-east Turkmenistan).

==Environment==
The sands of the Aral Karakum are made of finely-dispersed evaporites and remnants of alkaline mineral deposits, washed into the basin from irrigated fields.

==Wildlife==
Wildlife in this area is not very diverse and includes insects and arachnids such as ants, termites, ticks, spiders, dung beetles, and darkling beetles. Lizards, turtles and snakes also live in the Karakum. Bird species include &quot;Alauda&quot;, desert sparrows, and other species, while rodents include jerboas and gophers. The tolai hare, goitered gazelle, and corsac fox are examples of mammal species in the Karakum Desert.

==Geology==

The Karakum is home to the Darvaza gas crater. Also called the &quot;Door to Hell&quot; or the &quot;Gates of Hell&quot; by locals, it is a crater of natural gas that has been burning since 1971. The crater is a major tourist attraction, with hundreds of visitors arriving each year.

The area has significant oil and natural gas deposits.

==Hydrography==
To the south the Murghab and Tejen rivers flow out of the Hindu Kush mountains, flow west, and empty into the desert, providing water for irrigation.

The desert is crossed by the second-largest irrigation canal in the world, the Karakum Canal, which brings water from the Amu Darya to southern regions of the desert. Construction on the canal was started in 1954 and completed in 1958. It is in length, and carries 13 to 20 km3 of water annually.

==Archaeology==
Within the Karakum are the Uly Balkan, a mountain range in which archaeologists have found human remains dating back to the Stone Age.

==Economy and resources==
The oases of Mary and Tejen are noted for cotton growing.

==Transport==
The desert is crossed by the Trans-Caspian Railway.

== Golden Age Lake ==
Golden Age Lake, locally known as Altyn Asyr köli or alternatively as Karakum Lake, is a man-made lake under construction in the Karashor Depression in the Karakum Desert.

Upon completion, the lake will span with a maximum depth of , and hold more than 130 cubic kilometers (4600 billion cubic feet) of water. Filling the lake could take 15 years and cost up to $4.5 billion. According to government plans, it is intended to be filled by a network of tributary canals. The Dashoguz Collector, spanning a distance of 432 kilometers, traces approximately half of its course along the historic path of the Uzboy River. The Great Turkmen Collector starts in Lebap Province and is long. They are used for pumping run-off water from irrigated cotton fields towards the lake.

<text>Marisol Malaret Contreras (October 13, 1949 – March 19, 2023) was a Puerto Rican TV host, model and beauty queen who won the title of Miss Universe 1970, becoming the first Caribbean and Puerto Rican woman to be crowned Miss Universe.

==Biography==
Malaret was born in Utuado, Puerto Rico on October 13, 1949. She started to work from an early age due to the death of her father and chronic illness of her mother. She was reportedly persuaded by Puerto Rican make-up artist Carmen Andino to compete in the Miss Puerto Rico pageant, then owned by Puerto Rican modeling guru and businesswoman Anna Santisteban. Malaret&#x27;s strong will, ethics, and beauty made her a crowd favorite in the local contest. Before winning, she worked as an executive secretary for the Puerto Rico Telephone Company.

Malaret had one brother Jesús, and five half-siblings Joseph, Alicia, Rita, Antonio, and Raul. Her parents were Lydia Contreras and José Antonio Malaret. She was married three times; to former male model Butch James, musician Corky Stroman, with whom she had her only child Sasha, and Cuban-born engineer Frank Cué.

Malaret died from complications of a pulmonary condition on March 19, 2023, at age 73.

==Miss Universe 1970==
The auburn-haired, blue-green-eyed Malaret won the title on July 11, 1970, at the Miami Beach Auditorium in Miami Beach, Florida. Her victory also made her the first Puerto Rican and the first Caribbean to win the Miss Universe title. Additionally, she obtained Puerto Rico&#x27;s first ever placement at Miss Universe since its inception in 1952 and was the first Puerto Rican woman to win a major international pageant.

After her win in the Miss Universe pageant, she was honored with what was considered until then one of the biggest welcomings ever at San Juan&#x27;s Isla Verde International Airport. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;50,000 turned out in San Juan to honor a Queen.&quot;

She was also invited to the White House for a visit in the Oval Office with then-President Richard Nixon.

Malaret&#x27;s face graced the covers of many international and Puerto Rican entertainment and gossip magazines, such as Vea, Teve Guía, Artistas, Estrellas, and its smaller version Estrellitas. She participated in many advertising campaigns, and performed occasionally as a motivational speaker to young women and aspiring business leaders.

<text>Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound with the formula . It is a white crystalline salt consisting of ions of ammonium and nitrate. It is highly soluble in water and hygroscopic as a solid, but does not form hydrates. It is predominantly used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer.

Its other major use is as a component of explosive mixtures used in mining, quarrying, and civil construction. It is the major constituent of ANFO, an industrial explosive which accounts for 80% of explosives used in North America; similar formulations have been used in improvised explosive devices. 

Many countries are phasing out its use in consumer applications due to concerns over its potential for misuse. Accidental ammonium nitrate explosions have killed thousands of people since the early 20th century. Global production was estimated at 21.6 million tonnes in 2017. By 2021, global production of ammonium nitrate was down to 16.7 million tonnes.

==Occurrence==
Ammonium nitrate is found as the natural mineral gwihabaite (formerly known as nitrammite) – the ammonium analogue of saltpetre (mineralogical name: niter) – in the driest regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile, often as a crust on the ground or in conjunction with other nitrate, iodate, and halide minerals. Ammonium nitrate was mined there until the Haber–Bosch process made it possible to synthesize nitrates from atmospheric nitrogen, rendering nitrate mining obsolete.

==Production, reactions and crystalline phases==
The industrial production of ammonium nitrate entails the acid-base reaction of ammonia with nitric acid:
:HNO3 + NH3 → NH4NO3
The ammonia required for this process is obtained by the Haber process from nitrogen and hydrogen. Ammonia produced by the Haber process can be oxidized to nitric acid by the Ostwald process. Ammonia is used in its anhydrous form (a gas) and the nitric acid is concentrated. The reaction is violent owing to its highly exothermic nature. After the solution is formed, typically at about 83% concentration, the excess water is evaporated off to leave an ammonium nitrate (AN) content of 95% to 99.9% concentration (AN melt), depending on grade. The AN melt is then made into &quot;prills&quot; or small beads in a spray tower, or into granules by spraying and tumbling in a rotating drum. The prills or granules may be further dried, cooled, and then coated to prevent caking. These prills or granules are the typical AN products in commerce.

Another production method is a variant of the nitrophosphate process:

:Ca(NO3)2 + 2 NH3 + CO2 + H2O → 2 NH4NO3 + CaCO3

The products, calcium carbonate and ammonium nitrate, may be separately purified or sold combined as calcium ammonium nitrate.

Ammonium nitrate can also be made via metathesis reactions:
:(NH4)2SO4 + Ba(NO3)2 → 2 NH4NO3 + BaSO4
:(NH4)2SO4 + Ca(NO3)2 → 2 NH4NO3 + CaSO4
:NH4Cl + AgNO3 → NH4NO3 + AgCl
===Reactions===
As ammonium nitrate is a salt, both the cation, , and the anion, , may take part in chemical reactions. 

Solid ammonium nitrate decomposes on heating. At temperatures below around 300 °C, the decomposition mainly produces nitrous oxide and water:

: NH4NO3 → N2O + 2 H2O

At higher temperatures, the following reaction predominates.

: 2 NH4NO3 → 2 N2 + O2 + 4 H2O

Both decomposition reactions are exothermic and their products are gases. Under certain conditions, this can lead to a runaway reaction, with the decomposition process becoming explosive. See for details. Many ammonium nitrate disasters, with loss of lives, have occurred.

The red–orange colour in an explosion cloud is due to nitrogen dioxide, a secondary reaction product.

===Crystalline phases===
Several crystalline phases of ammonium nitrate have been observed. The following occur under atmospheric pressure. 
The transition between β-rhombic to α-rhombic forms (at 32.3 °C) occurs at ambient temperature in many parts of the world. These forms have a 3.6% difference in density and hence transition between them causes a change in volume. One practical consequence of this is that ammonium nitrate cannot be used as a solid rocket motor propellant, as it develops cracks. Stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) was developed as a solution to this and incorporates metal halides stabilisers, which prevent density fluctuations.

==Applications==
===Fertilizer===
Ammonium nitrate is an important fertilizer with NPK rating 34-0-0 (34% nitrogen). It is less concentrated than urea (46-0-0), giving ammonium nitrate a slight transportation disadvantage. Ammonium nitrate&#x27;s advantage over urea is that it is more stable and does not rapidly lose nitrogen to the atmosphere.

===Explosives===

Ammonium nitrate readily forms explosive mixtures with varying properties when combined with explosives such as TNT or with fuels like aluminium powder or fuel oil. 
Examples of explosives containing ammonium nitrate include:

* Amatex (ammonium nitrate, TNT and RDX)
* Amatol (ammonium nitrate and TNT)
* Ammonal (ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder)
* ANFO (ammonium nitrate and fuel oil)
* Astrolite (ammonium nitrate and hydrazine rocket fuel)
* Goma-2 (ammonium nitrate, nitroglycol, nitrocellulose, dibutyl phthalate and fuel)
* Minol (explosive) (ammonium nitrate, TNT and aluminum powder)
* Nitrolite (ammonium nitrate, TNT and nitroglycerin +)
* DBX (ammonium nitrate, RDX, TNT and aluminum powder)
* Tovex (ammonium nitrate and methylammonium nitrate)

====Mixture with fuel oil====

ANFO is a mixture of 94% ammonium nitrate (&quot;AN&quot;) and 6% fuel oil (&quot;FO&quot;) widely used as a bulk industrial explosive. It is used in coal mining, quarrying, metal mining, and civil construction in undemanding applications where the advantages of ANFO&#x27;s low cost, relative safety, and ease of use matter more than the benefits offered by conventional industrial explosives, such as water resistance, oxygen balance, high detonation velocity, and performance in small diameters.

====Terrorism====
Ammonium nitrate-based explosives were used in the Sterling Hall bombing in Madison, Wisconsin, 1970, the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the 2011 Delhi bombings, the 2011 bombing in Oslo, the Myyrmanni bombing and the 2013 Hyderabad blasts.

In November 2009, the government of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan imposed a ban on ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizers in the former Malakand Divisioncomprising the Upper Dir, Lower Dir, Swat, Chitral, and Malakand districts of the NWFP – following reports that those chemicals were used by militants to make explosives. Due to these bans, &quot;Potassium chloratethe material which allows safety matches to catch firehas surpassed fertilizer as the explosive of choice for insurgents.&quot;

===Niche uses===
Ammonium nitrate is used in some instant cold packs, as its dissolution in water is highly endothermic. In 2021, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia conducted experiments to study the potential for dissolving ammonium nitrate in water for off-grid cooling systems and as a refrigerant. They suggested that the water could be distilled and reused using solar energy to avoid water wastage in severe environments.

It was once used, in combination with independently explosive &quot;fuels&quot; such as guanidine nitrate, as a cheaper (but less stable) alternative to 5-aminotetrazole in the inflators of airbags manufactured by Takata Corporation, which were recalled as unsafe after killing 14 people. The current USA death total is 27.

==Safety, handling, and storage==
Numerous safety guidelines are available for storing and handling ammonium nitrate. Health and safety data are shown on the safety data sheets available from suppliers and from various governments. 

Pure ammonium nitrate does not burn, but as a strong oxidizer, it supports and accelerates the combustion of organic (and some inorganic) material. It should not be stored near combustible substances.

While ammonium nitrate is stable at ambient temperature and pressure under many conditions, it may detonate from a strong initiation charge. It should not be stored near high explosives or blasting agents. 

Molten ammonium nitrate is very sensitive to shock and detonation, particularly if it becomes contaminated with incompatible materials such as combustibles, flammable liquids, acids, chlorates, chlorides, sulfur, metals, charcoal and sawdust.

Contact with certain substances such as chlorates, mineral acids and metal sulfides, can lead to vigorous or even violent decomposition capable of igniting nearby combustible material or detonating.

Ammonium nitrate begins decomposition after melting, releasing , HNO3, NH and H2O. It should not be heated in a confined space. The resulting heat and pressure from decomposition increases the sensitivity to detonation and increases the speed of decomposition. Detonation may occur at 80 atmospheres. Contamination can reduce this to 20 atmospheres. 

Ammonium nitrate has a critical relative humidity of 59.4% at 30 °C. At higher humidity it will absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Therefore, it is important to store ammonium nitrate in a tightly sealed container. Otherwise, it can coalesce into a large, solid mass. Ammonium nitrate can absorb enough moisture to liquefy. Blending ammonium nitrate with certain other fertilizers can lower the critical relative humidity.

The potential for use of the material as an explosive has prompted regulatory measures. For example, in Australia, the Dangerous Goods Regulations came into effect in August 2005 to enforce licensing in dealing with such substances. Licenses are granted only to applicants (industry) with appropriate security measures in place to prevent any misuse. Additional uses such as education and research purposes may also be considered, but individual use will not. Employees of those with licenses to deal with the substance are still required to be supervised by authorized personnel and are required to pass a security and national police check before a license may be granted.

==Health hazards==
Ammonium nitrate is not hazardous to health and is usually used in fertilizer products.

Ammonium nitrate has an LD50 of 2217 mg/kg, which for comparison is about two-thirds that of table salt.

==Disasters==

Ammonium nitrate decomposes, non-explosively, into the gases nitrous oxide and water vapor when heated. However, it can be induced to decompose explosively by detonation. Large stockpiles of the material can also be a major fire risk due to their supporting oxidation, a situation which can easily escalate to detonation. Explosions are not uncommon: relatively minor incidents occur most years, and several large and devastating explosions have also occurred. Examples include the Oppau explosion of 1921 (one of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions), the Texas City disaster of 1947, the 2015 Tianjin explosions in China, and the 2020 Beirut explosion.

Ammonium nitrate can explode through two mechanisms:
* Shock induced detonation. An explosive charge within or in contact with a mass of ammonium nitrate causes the ammonium nitrate to detonate. Examples of such disasters are Kriewald, Morgan (present-day Sayreville, New Jersey), Oppau, and Tessenderlo.
* Deflagration to detonation transition. The ammonium nitrate explosion results from a fire that spreads into the ammonium nitrate (Texas City, TX; Brest; West, TX; Tianjin; Beirut), or from ammonium nitrate mixing with a combustible material during the fire (Gibbstown, Cherokee, Nadadores). The fire must be confined at least to a degree for successful transition from a fire to an explosion.

<text>The Pauly encyclopedias or the Pauly-Wissowa family of encyclopedias, are a set of related encyclopedias on Greco-Roman topics and scholarship. The first of these, or (1839-1852), was begun by compiler August Friedrich Pauly. Other encyclopedias in the set include &quot;Pauly–Wissowa&quot; (1890-1978), &quot;Little Pauly&quot; (1964-1975), and &quot;The New Pauly&quot; (1996-2012).

==Ur-Pauly==

The first edition was the &#x27; (&quot;Practical Encyclopedia of the Study of Classical Ancient History in Alphabetical Order&quot;) originally compiled by August Friedrich Pauly. As the basis for the subsequent PaulyWissowa edition, it is also known as the &#x27;. The first volume was published in 1839 but Pauly died in 1845 before the last was completed. Christian Waltz (18021857) and Wilhelm Siegmund Teuffel completed the 6 volume first edition in 1852.

A second edition of the first volume of Pauly&#x27;s encyclopedia was published by Teuffel in 1861. The revised second volume came out in 1866, with the rest of the work left incomplete.

==Pauly–Wissowa==
Georg Wissowa began work on a new and more ambitious edition in 1890. &#x27; (&quot;Pauly&#x27;s Practical Encyclopedia of the Study of Classical Ancient History&quot;), more commonly known as the Pauly–Wissowa ( PW&quot;&quot;&#x27;), was planned for completion by 1900 but work again outlasted its initial editor. Continued under Wilhelm Kroll, Kurt Witte, Karl Mittelhaus, and Konrat Ziegler, the series was not completed until 1972, with supplements added until 1978 and the index in 1980. Each article was written by a recognized specialist in the relevant field, but unsurprisingly for a work spanning three generations, the underlying assumptions vary radically with the age of the article. Many early biographies were written by Elimar Klebs, Paul von Rohden, Friedrich Münzer, and Otto Seeck.

==Little Pauly==

The size and price of Wissowa&#x27;s edition being daunting, Konrat Ziegler put out an abridged (&quot;The Little Pauly&quot;; &quot;KlP&quot;) edition of 5 volumes between 1964 and 1975. Ziegler was assisted by Walther Sontheimer and Hans Gärtner.

==New Pauly==
&#x27; (&quot;The New Pauly&quot;) was published in 16 volumes from 1996 to 2003, including 12 volumes on antiquity edited primarily by Hubert Cancik and Helmuth Schneider, 3 volumes on the classical tradition edited primarily by Manfred Landfester, and an index. The English translation was published as Brill&#x27;s New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World&quot;&quot;&#x27; in 22 volumes between 2002 and 2014. Supplements have been published regularly since 2004 in German and English translation. Among other numbering differences, there is one less supplement in the English edition than the German edition because in the German edition the index to the &quot;Classical Tradition&quot; was counted as a supplement.

<doc id="96598" wikidata="Q1134106" url="?curid=96598" title="Cornerstone Festival">
<text>Cornerstone Festival was a Christian music festival put on by Jesus People USA and held annually around July 4 near Bushnell, Illinois, drawing some 20,000 attendees each year. In a given year, many artists that played at Cornerstone also played at other events such as Creation Festival and mainstream festivals and tours such as the Warped Tour. The final festival was held in 2012.

Cornerstone Festival was a member of the Christian Festival Association.

==History==
From 1984 to 1990, Cornerstone was held at the Lake County Fairgrounds near Grayslake, Illinois. In 1991, Cornerstone moved near the town of Bushnell (outside Macomb) where the organizers of the festival purchased a large piece of land, which is now called &quot;Cornerstone Farm&quot;.

Tens of thousands of people attended Cornerstone Farm each year and saw over 300 bands play many styles of music, including rock, metal, punk, hardcore and pop music. In addition to the many musicians, Cornerstone Festival also presented guest speakers, and featured independent/foreign film screenings, writers&#x27; seminars, and art workshops.
In 2010 the festival&#x27;s main stage moved to the &quot;Midway&quot;, which is about 0.7 miles northeast of its previous location in the &quot;bowl&quot;.

The 2011 festival featured a Jesus Rally showcasing many of the groundbreaking Jesus music artists including; Servant, Daniel Amos, Randy Stonehill, Barry McGuire, Resurrection Band, Phil Keaggy, and Classic Petra.

On May 15, 2012 it was announced that the 2012 Festival would be the last. The final song performed at Cornerstone, on July 7, 2012, was &quot;To Bid Farewell&quot; performed by Derri Daugherty and Steve Hindalong of The Choir.

The festival ceased due to budgetary reasons.

<doc id="96602" wikidata="Q16967" url="?curid=96602" title="Zhejiang">
<text>Zhejiang is an eastern coastal province of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Its capital and largest city is Hangzhou, and other notable cities include Ningbo and Wenzhou. Zhejiang is bordered by Jiangsu and Shanghai to the north, Anhui to the northwest, Jiangxi to the west and Fujian to the south. To the east is the East China Sea, beyond which lies the Ryukyu Islands. The population of Zhejiang stands at 64.6 million, the 8th largest in China. It has been called &quot;the backbone of China&quot; because it is a major driving force in the Chinese economy and being the birthplace of several notable people, including the Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek and entrepreneur Jack Ma. Zhejiang consists of 90 counties (incl. county-level cities and districts).

The area of Zhejiang was controlled by the Kingdom of Yue during the Spring and Autumn period. The Qin Empire later annexed it in 222 BC. Under the late Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty that followed it, Zhejiang&#x27;s ports became important centers of international trade. It was occupied by the Empire of Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese war and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the Reorganized National Government of China. After the establishment of the PRC, Zhejiang&#x27;s economy became stagnant under Mao Zedong&#x27;s policies. Nevertheless, after China&#x27;s economic reform, Zhejiang has grown to be considered one of China&#x27;s wealthiest provinces, ranking fourth in GDP nationally and sixth by GDP per capita, with a nominal GDP of US$1.14 trillion as of 2022.

Zhejiang consists mostly of hills, which account for about 70% of its total area, with higher altitudes towards the south and the west. Zhejiang also has a longer coastline than any other mainland province of China. The Qiantang River runs through the province, from which it derives its name. Included in the province are three thousand islands, the most in China. The capital Hangzhou marks the end of the Grand Canal and lies on Hangzhou Bay on the north of Zhejiang, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. The bay contains many small islands collectively called the Zhoushan Islands.

Hangzhou is a historically important city of China and is considered a World City with a &quot;Beta+&quot; classification according to GaWC. It includes the notable West Lake. Various varieties of Chinese are spoken in Zhejiang, the most prominent being Wu Chinese. Zhejiang is also one of China&#x27;s leading provinces in research and education. , two major cities in Zhejiang ranked in the world&#x27;s top 200 cities (Hangzhou 13th and Ningbo 123rd) by scientific research output, as tracked by Nature Index.

==Etymology==
The province&#x27;s name originates from the Zhe River (), the former name of the Qiantang River which flows past Hangzhou and whose mouth forms Hangzhou Bay. It is usually understood as meaning &quot;Crooked&quot; or &quot;Bent River&quot;, from the meaning of Chinese , but is more likely a phono-semantic compound formed from adding (the &quot;water&quot; radical used for river names) to phonetic (Pinyin &quot;zhé&quot; but reconstructed Old Chinese *&quot;tet&quot;), preserving a proto-Wu name of the local Yue, similar to Yuhang, Kuaiji and Jiang.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Kuahuqiao culture was an early Neolithic culture that flourished in the Hangzhou area in 6,000-5,000 BC.

Zhejiang was the site of the Neolithic cultures of the Hemudu (starting in 5500 BC) and Liangzhu (starting in 3400 BC).

===Ancient history===
The area of modern Zhejiang was outside the major sphere of influence of Shang civilization during the second millennium BC. Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as Dongyue.

The kingdom of Yue began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the Spring and Autumn period. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was in Northern Zhejiang. Shiji claims that its leaders were descended from the Xia founder Yu the Great. The &quot;Song of the Yue Boatman&quot; () was transliterated into Chinese and recorded by authors in North China or inland China of Hebei and Henan around 528 BC. The song shows that the Yue people spoke a language that was mutually unintelligible with the dialects spoken in north and inland China. The Sword of Goujian bears bird-worm seal script. Yuenü () was a swordswoman from the state of Yue. To check the growth of the kingdom of Wu, Chu pursued a policy of strengthening Yue.

Under King Goujian, Yue recovered from its early reverses and fully annexed the lands of its rival in . The Yue kings then moved their capital center from their original home around Mount Kuaiji in present-day Shaoxing to the former Wu capital at present-day Suzhou. With no southern power to turn against Yue, Chu opposed it directly and, in 333 BC, succeeded in destroying it. Yue&#x27;s former lands were annexed by the Qin Empire in 222 BC and organized into a commandery named for Kuaiji in Zhejiang but initially headquartered in Wu in Jiangsu.

===Han and the Three Kingdoms===
Kuaiji Commandery was the initial power base for Xiang Liang and Xiang Yu&#x27;s rebellion against the Qin Empire which initially succeeded in restoring the kingdom of Chu but eventually fell to the Han. Under the Later Han, control of the area returned to the settlement below Mount Kuaiji but authority over the Minyue hinterland was nominal at best and its Yue inhabitants largely retained their own political and social structures.

At the beginning of the Three Kingdoms era (AD 220–280), Zhejiang was home to the warlords Yan Baihu and Wang Lang prior to their defeat by Sun Ce and Sun Quan, who eventually established the Kingdom of Wu. Despite the removal of their court from Kuaiji to Jianye (present-day Nanjing) and they continued development of the region and benefitted from influxes of refugees fleeing the turmoil in northern China. Industrial kilns were established and trade reached as far as Manchuria and Funan (southern Mainland Southeast Asia).

Zhejiang was part of the Wu during the Three Kingdoms. Wu (229–280), commonly known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, had been the economically most developed state among the Three Kingdoms (220–280). The historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms records that Zhejiang had the best-equipped naval force. The story depicts how the states of Wei () and Shu (), lack of material resources, avoided direct confrontation with the Wu. In armed military conflicts with Wu, the two states relied intensively on tactics of camouflage and deception to steal Wu&#x27;s military resources including arrows and bows.

===Six Dynasties===
Despite the continuing prominence of Nanjing (then known as Jiankang), the settlement of Qiantang, the former name of Hangzhou, remained one of the three major metropolitan centers in the south to provide major tax revenue to the imperial centers in the north China. The other two centers in the south were Jiankang and Chengdu. In 589, Qiantang was raised in status and renamed Hangzhou.

Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (266–420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege and took refuge in areas south of the Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from North China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181–234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name &quot;Zhuge.&quot; The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refuge south of the Yangtze River. However, considering the mountainous geography and relative lack of agrarian lands in Zhejiang, most of these refugees might have resided in some areas in South China beyond Zhejiang, where fertile agrarian lands and metropolitan resources were available, mainly Southern Jiangsu, Eastern Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui and provinces where less cohesive, organized regional governments had been in place. Metropolitan areas of Sichuan was another hub for refugees, given that the state of Shu had long been founded and ruled by political and military elites from the Central Plain and North China. Some refugees from North China might have found residence in South China depending on their social status and military power in the north. The rump Jin state or the Southern dynasties vied against some elite Chinese from the Central Plain and south of the Yangtze River.

===Sui and Tang eras===
Zhejiang, as the heartland of the Jiangnan (Yangtze River Delta), remained the wealthiest area during the Six Dynasties (220 or 222–589), Sui and Tang. After being incorporated into the Sui dynasty, its economic richness was used for the Sui dynasty&#x27;s ambitions to expand north and south, particularly into Korea and Vietnam. The plan led the Sui dynasty to restore and expand the network which became the Grand Canal of China. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the Zhe River and the shores of Hangzhou Bay) and from Suzhou and thence to the North China Plain. The débâcle of the Korean war led to Sui&#x27;s overthrow by the Tang, who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country. Zhejiang was an important economic center of the empire&#x27;s Jiangnan East Circuit and was considered particularly prosperous. Throughout the Tang dynasty, The Grand Canal had remained effective, transporting grains and material resources to North China plain and metropolitan centers of the empire. As the Tang dynasty disintegrated, Zhejiang constituted most of the territory of the regional kingdom of Wuyue.

===Wuyue era===
After the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907, the entire area of what is now Zhejiang fell under the control of the kingdom Wuyue established by King Qian Liu, who selected Hangzhou (a city in the modern day area of Zhejiang) as his kingdom&#x27;s capital. Despite being under Wuyue rule for a relatively short period of time, Zhejiang underwent a long period of financial and cultural prosperity which continued even after the kingdom fell.
After Wuyue was conquered during the reunification of China, many shrines were erected across the former territories of Wuyue, mainly in Zhejiang, where the kings of Wuyue were memorialised, and sometimes, worshipped as being able to dictate weather and agriculture. Many of these shrines, known as &quot;Shrine of the Qian King&quot; or &quot;Temple to the Qian King&quot;, still remain today, with the most popularly visited example being that near West Lake in Hangzhou.

China&#x27;s province of Zhejiang during the 940s was also the place of origin of the Hú family (Hồ in Vietnamese) from which the founder of the Hồ dynasty who ruled Vietnam, Emperor Hồ Quý Ly, came from.

===Song era===

The Song dynasty re-established unity around 960. Under the Song, the prosperity of South China began to overtake that of North China. After the north was lost to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1127 following the Jingkang Incident, Hangzhou became the capital of the Song dynasty under the name Lin&#x27;an, which was renowned for its prosperity and beauty, it was suspected to have been the largest city in the world at the time.

From then on, northern Zhejiang and neighboring southern Jiangsu have been synonymous with luxury and opulence in Chinese culture. The Mongol conquest and the establishment of the Yuan dynasty in 1279 ended Hangzhou&#x27;s political clout, but its economy continued to prosper. The famous traveler Marco Polo visited the city, which he called &quot;Kinsay&quot; (after the Chinese &quot;Jingshi&quot;, meaning &quot;Capital City&quot;) claiming it was &quot;the finest and noblest city in the world.&quot;

Greenware ceramics made from celadon had been made in the area since the 3rd-century Jin dynasty, but it returned to prominence—particularly in Longquan—during the Southern Song and Yuan. Longquan greenware is characterized by a thick unctuous glaze of a particular bluish-green tint over an otherwise undecorated light-grey porcellaneous body that is delicately potted. Yuan Longquan celadons feature a thinner, greener glaze on larger vessels with decoration and shapes derived from Middle Eastern ceramic and metalwares. These were produced in large quantities for the Chinese export trade to Southeast Asia, the Middle East and (during the Ming) Europe. By the Ming, however, production was notably deficient in quality. It is in this period that the Longquan kilns declined, to be eventually replaced in popularity and ceramic production by the kilns of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi.

===Yuan and Ming eras===

Zhejiang was finally conquered by the Mongols in the late 13th century who later established the short lived Yuan dynasty. Zhejiang became part of the much larger Jiangzhe Province.

The Ming dynasty, which drove out the Mongols in 1368, finally established the present day province of Zhejiang with its borders having little changes since this establishment.

As in other coastal provinces, number of fortresses were constructed along the Zhejiang coast during the early Ming to defend the land against pirate incursions. Some of them have been preserved or restored, such as Pucheng in the south of the province (Cangnan County).

===Qing era===

Under the late Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty that followed it, Zhejiang&#x27;s ports were important centers of international trade.

&quot;In 1727 the to-min or &#x27;idle people&#x27; of Cheh Kiang province (a Ningpo name still existing), the yoh-hu or &#x27;music people&#x27; of Shanxi province, the si-min or &#x27;small people&#x27; of Kiang Su (Jiangsu) province and the Tanka people or &#x27;egg-people&#x27; of Canton (to this day the boat population there), were all freed from their social disabilities and allowed to count as free men.&quot; &quot;Cheh Kiang&quot; is another romanization for Zhejiang. The Duomin () are a caste of outcasts in this province.

During the First Opium War, the British navy defeated Eight Banners forces at Ningbo and Dinghai. Under the terms of the Treaty of Nanking, signed in 1843, Ningbo became one of the five Chinese treaty ports opened to virtually unrestricted foreign trade. Much of Zhejiang came under the control of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom during the Taiping Rebellion, which resulted in a considerable loss of life in the north-western and central parts of the province, sparing the rest of Zhejiang from the disastrous depopulation that occurred. In 1876, Wenzhou became Zhejiang&#x27;s second treaty port. Jianghuai Mandarin speakers later came to settle in these depopulated regions of northern Zhejiang.

===Republican era===

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, which led into World War II, much of Zhejiang was occupied by Japan and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the Reorganized National Government of China. Following the Doolittle Raid, most of the B-25 American crews that came down in China eventually made it to safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. The Chinese people who helped them, however, paid dearly for sheltering the Americans. The Imperial Japanese Army began the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign to intimidate the Chinese out of helping downed American airmen. Imperial Japanese forces killed an estimated 250,000 Chinese civilians from the area of Hangzhou to Nanchang and also Zhuzhou while searching for Doolittle&#x27;s men.

===People&#x27;s Republic era===
After the People&#x27;s Republic of China took control of Mainland China in 1949, the Republic of China government based in Taiwan continued to control the Dachen Islands off the coast of Zhejiang until 1955, even establishing a rival Zhejiang provincial government there. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), Zhejiang was in chaos and disunity and its economy was stagnant, especially during the high tide (1966–69) of the revolution. The agricultural policy favoring grain production at the expense of industrial and cash crops intensified economic hardships in the province. Mao&#x27;s self-reliance policy and the reduction in maritime trade cut off the lifelines of the port cities of Ningbo and Wenzhou. While Mao invested heavily in railroads in interior China, no major railroads were built in South Zhejiang, where transportation remained poor.

Zhejiang benefited less from central government investment than some other provinces due to its lack of natural resources, a location vulnerable to potential flooding from the sea and an economic base at the national average. Zhejiang, however, has been an epicenter of capitalist development in China and has led the nation in the development of a market economy and private enterprises. Northeast Zhejiang, as part of the Yangtze Delta, is flat, more developed and industrial.

==Geography==

Zhejiang consists mostly of hills, which account for about 70% of its total area. Altitudes tend to be the highest to the south and west and the highest peak of the province, Huangmaojian Peak (), is located there. Other prominent mountains include Mounts Yandang, Tianmu, Tiantai and Mogan, which reach altitudes of .

Valleys and plains are found along the coastline and rivers. The north of the province lies just south of the Yangtze Delta and consists of plains around the cities of Hangzhou, Jiaxing and Huzhou, where the Grand Canal of China enters from the northern border to end at Hangzhou. Another relatively flat area is found along the Qu River around the cities of Quzhou and Jinhua. Major rivers include the Qiangtang and Ou Rivers. Most rivers carve out valleys in the highlands, with plenty of rapids and other features associated with such topography. Well-known lakes include the West Lake of Hangzhou and the South Lake of Jiaxing.

There are over three thousand islands along the rugged coastline of Zhejiang. The largest, Zhoushan Island, is mainland China&#x27;s third largest island, after Hainan and Chongming. There are also many bays, of which Hangzhou Bay is the largest. Zhejiang has a humid subtropical climate with four distinct seasons. Spring starts in March and is rainy with changeable weather. Summer, from June to September is long, hot, rainy and humid. Fall is generally dry, warm and sunny. Winters are short but cold except in the far south. Average annual temperature is around , average January temperature is around and average July temperature is around . Annual precipitation is about . There is plenty of rainfall in early summer and by late summer Zhejiang is directly threatened by typhoons forming in the Pacific.

==Administrative divisions==

Zhejiang is divided into eleven prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities (including two sub-provincial cities):

The eleven prefecture-level divisions of Zhejiang are subdivided into 90 county-level divisions (37 districts, 20 county-level cities, 32 counties, and one autonomous county). Those are in turn divided into 1,364 township-level divisions (618 towns, 488 townships, and 258 subdistricts). Hengdian belongs to Jinhua, which is the largest base of shooting films and TV dramas in China. Hengdian World Studios is called &quot;China&#x27;s Hollywood.&quot; At the year end of 2021, the total population was 65.40 million.

==Politics==

The politics of Zhejiang is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China. The Governor of Zhejiang is the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Government of Zhejiang. However, in the province&#x27;s dual party-government governing system, the Governor is subordinate to the secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

Several political figures who served as Zhejiang&#x27;s top political office of Party Secretary have played key roles in various events in PRC history. Tan Zhenlin (term 1949–1952), the inaugural Party Secretary, was one of the leading voices against Mao&#x27;s Cultural Revolution during the so-called February Countercurrent of 1967. Jiang Hua (term 1956–1968), was the &quot;chief justice&quot; on the Special Court in the case against the Gang of Four in 1980. Three provincial Party Secretaries since the 1990s have gone onto prominence at the national level. They include CPC General Secretary and President Xi Jinping (term 2002–2007), National People&#x27;s Congress Chairman and former Vice-Premier Zhang Dejiang (term 1998–2002), and Zhao Hongzhu (term 2007–2012), the Deputy Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, China&#x27;s top anti-corruption body. Of Zhejiang&#x27;s fourteen Party Secretaries since 1949, none were native to the province.

Zhejiang was home to Chiang Kai-shek and many high-ranking officials in the Kuomintang, who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Civil War.

==Economy==

Zhejiang is one of the richest and most developed provinces in China. , its nominal GDP was US$1.15 trillion (CN¥ 7.77 trilion), about 6.42% of the country&#x27;s GDP and ranked 4th among province-level administrative units; the province&#x27;s primary, secondary and tertiary industries were worth CN¥232.48 billion (US$34.56 billion), CN¥3.3205 trillion (US$493.67 billion) and CN¥4.2185 trillion (US$627.18 billion) respectively. Its nominal GDP per capita was US$17,617 (CN¥118,496) and ranked the 6th in the country. The private sector in the province has been playing an increasingly important role in boosting the regional economy since Economic Reform in 1978. Zhejiang is generally regarded as having one of the strongest private sectors among Chinese provinces and its local governments typically adopt permissive business policies.

Zhejiang&#x27;s main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the &quot;Zhejiang model&quot;, which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces and the &quot;Zhejiang spirit&quot; has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 55,574 yuan (US$8,398) in 2018, an annual real growth of 8.4%. The per capita disposable income of rural residents stood at 27,302 yuan (US$4,126), a real growth of 9.4%.

Zhejiang was the first province to pilot a common prosperity pilot program.

Traditionally, the province is known as the &quot;Land of Fish and Rice.&quot; True to its name, rice is the main crop, followed by wheat; north Zhejiang is also a center of aquaculture in China, and the Zhoushan fishery is the largest fishery in the country. The main cash crops include jute and cotton and the province also leads the provinces of China in tea production. (The renowned Longjing tea is a product of Hangzhou.) Zhejiang&#x27;s towns have been known for handicraft production of goods such as silk, for which it is ranked second among the provinces. Its many market towns connect the cities with the countryside.

In 1832, the province was exporting silk, paper, fans, pencils, wine, dates, tea and &quot;golden-flowered&quot; hams.

Zhejiang has been leading the digital economy development in China, in recent years, the provincial economy has been boosted by the economic surge brought by internet corporations such as Alibaba and NetEase.

Ningbo, Wenzhou, Taizhou and Zhoushan are important commercial ports. The Hangzhou Bay Bridge between Haiyan County and Cixi, is the longest bridge over a continuous body of sea water in the world.

===Economic and technological development concerns===
====Waste disposal====
On Thursday, September 15, 2011, more than 500 people from Hongxiao Village protested over the large-scale death of fish in a nearby river. Angry protesters stormed the Zhejiang Jinko Solar Company factory compound, overturned eight company vehicles, and destroyed the offices before police came to disperse the crowd. Protests continued on the two following nights with reports of scuffles, officials said. Chen Hongming, a deputy head of Haining&#x27;s environmental protection bureau, said the factory&#x27;s waste disposal had failed pollution tests since April. The environmental watchdog had warned the factory, but it had not effectively controlled the pollution, Chen added.

==Demographics==

Han Chinese make up the vast majority of the population and the largest Han subgroup are the speakers of Wu varieties of Chinese. There are also 400,000 members of ethnic minorities, including approximately 200,000 She people and approximately 20,000 Hui Chinese. Jingning She Autonomous County in Lishui is the only She autonomous county in China.
== Religion ==

The predominant religions in Zhejiang are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 23.02% of the population believes and is involved in ancestor veneration, while 2.62% of the population identifies as Christian, decreasing from 3.92% in 2004. The reports did not give figures for other types of religion; 74.36% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects. As of the mid-2010s, Zhejiang has 34,880 registered folk religious temples greater than 20 sqm and 10,000 registered places of worship of the five doctrines (Buddhism, Taoism, Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam).

In mid-2015 the government of Zhejiang recognised folk religion as &quot;civil religion&quot; beginning the formal registration of the province&#x27;s folk religious temples under the aegis of the provincial Bureau of Folk Faith. Buddhism has an important presence since its arrival in Zhejiang 1,800 years ago.

Catholicism arrived 400 years ago in the province and Protestantism 150 years ago. Zhejiang is one of the provinces of China with the largest concentrations of Protestants, especially notable in the city of Wenzhou. In 1999, Zhejiang&#x27;s Protestant population comprised 2.8% of the provincial population, a small percentage but higher than the national average.

The rapid development of religions in Zhejiang has driven the local committee of ethnic and religious affairs to enact policies to rationalise them in 2014, variously named &quot;Three Remodelings and One Demolition&quot; operations or &quot;Special Treatment Work on Illegally Constructed Sites of Religious and Folk Religion Activities&quot; according to the locality. These regulations have led to cases of demolition of churches and folk religion temples or the removal of crosses from churches&#x27; roofs and spires. An exemplary case was that of the Sanjiang Church. Despite English-language media focused on Christian churches, only 2.3% of the buildings affected by the regulations were Christian churches; most of them were folk religious temples.

Islam arrived 1,400 years ago in Zhejiang. Today Islam is practiced by a small number of people including virtually all the Hui Chinese living in Zhejiang. In 2020, there are 117,000 Muslims in Zhejiang. Another religion present in the province is She shamanism (practiced by She ethnic minority).

==Media==
The Zhejiang Radio &amp; Television Group, Hangzhou Radio &amp; Television Group, Ningbo Radio &amp; Television Group are the local broadcasters in Zhejiang Province.

==Culture==

===Languages===
Zhejiang is mountainous and has therefore fostered the development of many distinct local cultures. Linguistically speaking, Zhejiang is extremely diverse. Most inhabitants of Zhejiang speak varieties of Wu, but those Wu dialects are very diverse, especially in the south, where one valley may speak a dialect completely unintelligible to the next valley a few kilometers away. Other varieties of Chinese are spoken as well, mostly along the borders; Mandarin and Huizhou dialects are spoken on the border with Anhui, while Min dialects are spoken on the border with Fujian. (See Hangzhou dialect, Shaoxing dialect, Ningbo dialect, Wenzhou dialect, Taizhou dialect, Jinhua dialect and Quzhou dialect for more information)

Throughout history there have been a series of &quot;lingua francas&quot; in the area to allow for better communication. The dialects spoken in Hangzhou, Shaoxing and Ningbo have taken on this role historically. Since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Mandarin, which is not mutually intelligible with any of the Wu dialects, has been promoted as the standard language of communication throughout China. As a result, most of the population now can, to some degree, speak and comprehend Mandarin and can code-switch when necessary. A majority of the population educated since 1978 can speak some Mandarin. Urban residents tend to be more fluent in Mandarin than rural people. Nevertheless, a Zhejiang accent is detectable in almost everyone from the area communicating in Mandarin and the home dialect remains an important part of the everyday lives and cultural identities of most Zhejiang residents.

===Music===
Zhejiang is the home of Yue opera, one of the most prominent forms of Chinese opera. &quot;Yueju&quot; originated in Shengzhou and is traditionally performed by actresses only, in both male and female roles. Other important opera traditions include Yongju (of Ningbo), Shao opera (of Shaoxing), Ouju (of Wenzhou), Wuju (of Jinhua), Taizhou Luantan (of Taizhou) and Zhuji Luantan (of Zhuji).

===Cuisine===

Longjing tea (also called dragon well tea), originating in Hangzhou, is one of the most prestigious, if not &quot;the&quot; most prestigious Chinese tea. Hangzhou is also renowned for its silk umbrellas and hand fans. Zhejiang cuisine (itself subdivided into many traditions, including Hangzhou cuisine) is one of the eight great traditions of Chinese cuisine.

===Place names===
Since ancient times, north Zhejiang and neighboring south Jiangsu have been famed for their prosperity and opulence and simply inserting north Zhejiang place names (Hangzhou, Jiaxing, etc.) into poetry gave an effect of dreaminess, a practice followed by many noted poets. In particular, the fame of Hangzhou (as well as Suzhou in neighboring Jiangsu province) has led to the popular saying: &quot;Above there is heaven; below there is Suzhou and Hangzhou&quot; (), a saying that continues to be a source of pride for the people of these two still prosperous cities.
