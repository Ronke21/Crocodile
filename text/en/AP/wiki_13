<text>Kearny County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Lakin. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 3,983. The county is named in honor of Philip Kearny, a general during the American Civil War that died during the Battle of Chantilly.

==History==

The original Kearney County was established on March 6, 1873, and was dissolved in 1883, with the land area being split between Hamilton and Finney counties. It was reestablished with its original borders in 1887, and organized on March 27, 1888. The county is named in honor of Philip Kearny, a U.S. Army officer in the Mexican–American War and a Union army general in the American Civil War. In 1889, the name was corrected to Kearny County.

Prior to settlement, Kearny County was unorganized territory that was entirely &quot;cow country,&quot; undeveloped and with no agricultural activity except for cattlemen grazing their herds. The region was part of the vast open range found in the American West at that time.

In the mid-1880s, homesteaders began pouring into the area, initiating conflicts with the existing cattle ranching industry as they claimed land and fenced off the open range. Towns like Leeser, established in 1885, and Pierceville, est. 1886, were built to service the cattle industry, but disappeared as homesteading displaced the great cattle herds.

The arrival of homesteaders was seen as both an opportunity for development but also a threat to the cattle industry&#x27;s way of life, with numerous allegations of ranchers trying to drive settlers out by destroying crops and setting prairie fires appearing in local newspapers.

In the 1930s, the prosperity of the area was severely affected by its location within the Dust Bowl. This catastrophe intensified the economic impact of the Great Depression in the region.

<text>Johnson County is a county in the U.S. state of Kansas, along the border of the state of Missouri. Its county seat is Olathe. As of the 2020 census, the population was 609,863, making it the most populous county in Kansas. The county was named after Thomas Johnson, a Methodist missionary who was one of the state&#x27;s first settlers. Largely suburban, the county contains a number of suburbs of Kansas City, Missouri, including Overland Park, a principal city of and the second most populous city in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area.

==History==
This was part of the large territory of the Osage people, who occupied lands up to present-day St. Louis. After the Indian Removal, the United States government reserved much of this area as Indian territory for a reservation for the Shawnee people, who were relocated from east of the Mississippi River in the upper Midwest.

The Santa Fe Trail and Oregon–California Trail, which pass through nearby Independence, Missouri, also passed through the county. Johnson County was established in 1855 as one of the first counties in the newly organized Kansas Territory; it was named for proslavery American missionary Thomas Johnson. The renowned gunfighter Wild Bill Hickok settled for a time in the county, becoming constable of Monticello Township in 1858.

Johnson County was the site of many battles between abolitionists and pro-slavery advocates during the period of Bleeding Kansas, prior to the residents voting on whether slavery would be allowed in the territory. In 1862, during the Civil War, Confederate guerrillas from nearby Missouri, led by William Quantrill, raided the Johnson County communities of Olathe and Spring Hill. They killed half a dozen men and destroyed numerous homes and businesses.

The county was largely rural until the early 20th century, when housing subdivisions were developed in the northeastern portion of the county adjacent to Kansas City, Missouri. Developer J. C. Nichols spurred the boom in 1914 when he built the Mission Hills Country Club to attract upscale residents who previously had been reluctant to move from Missouri to Kansas. Suburban development continued at a steady pace until the close of World War II.

Following the war, the pace of development exploded, triggered by the return of veterans in need of housing, construction of highways that facilitated commuting from suburbs, and the pent-up demand for new housing. The US Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) ruled that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. Integration of public schools in Kansas City, Missouri, resulted in many white families leaving the inner city, resulting in increased migration to the county for new housing and what were considered higher quality public schools, generally an indicator of higher economic status. From the mid-1980s, the pace of growth increased significantly, with the county adding 100,000 residents each decade between the 1990 census and 2010 census.

The 1952 Johnson County Courthouse was closed in 2020, then demolished in 2021. It was replaced by a seven-story courthouse in 2021 after over two years of construction. This new courthouse is the county&#x27;s fourth such building.

==Geography==

Located in northeastern Kansas, the county receives plentiful rainfall. The county contains numerous small streams, including Kill Creek, Mill Creek, Turkey Creek, Indian Creek, Brush Creek, Tomahawk Creek, the Blue River, Bull Creek and Little Bull Creek.

Kill Creek begins in the southwestern portion of the county and flows northward into the Kansas River at De Soto. Mill Creek begins in the central portion of the county in Olathe, flowing northward it empties into the Kansas River at Shawnee. Turkey Creek and Brush Creek each begin in northeastern Johnson County. Turkey Creek flows northeastward into Wyandotte County and joins the Kansas River just before its confluence with the Missouri River at Kaw Point. Brush Creek flows east-northeastward through Prairie Village and Mission Hills, entering Kansas City, Missouri, within the median of Ward Parkway and passing the Country Club Plaza before emptying into the Blue River east of the Country Club Plaza and north of Swope Park. Indian Creek begins in the southern portion of Olathe and Tomahawk Creek begins in southern Overland Park. Each flows northeastward meeting in Leawood, where the stream retains the name of Indian Creek, just before crossing the state line and entering the Blue River in Kansas City, Missouri. The Blue River begins in rural southern Johnson County and flows north-northeastward through the southeastern portion of the county and crossing the state line just east of the intersection of 151st Street and Kenneth Road in southern Overland Park. The Blue River flows through southern and eastern Kansas City before joining the Missouri River. Bull Creek and Little Bull Creek begin in rural southwestern Johnson County and flow southward where they enter Hillsdale Lake before continuing into Franklin County, eventually joining the Marais des Cygnes at Paola.

===Flora and fauna===
The county consists primarily of prairie grassland, with corridors of forested areas along streams and rivers.

==Government==

===Laws===

The county voted &quot;No&quot; on the 2022 Kansas abortion referendum, an anti-abortion ballot measure, by 69% to 31%, outpacing its support of Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential election.

===Federal representation===














Johnson County is entirely located within Kansas&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, which has been represented by Democrat Sharice Davids since 2019. The two U.S. Senators from Kansas are Republicans Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran.

Johnson County, historically a Republican stronghold, was consistently won by the GOP in every presidential election from 1920 to 2016, including Barry Goldwater’s 1964 election victory despite his statewide loss. The county even denied Franklin Roosevelt in all four of his campaigns, with his closest margin coming in 1932, where he lost by just two votes. However, in 2016, Republican Donald Trump won the county by less than three points, as the GOP’s shift toward right-wing populism alienated moderate voters. By 2020, Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win the county since Woodrow Wilson in 1916, securing an 8% margin and the highest share of the vote ever for a Democrat there. In 2024, Kamala Harris not only carried the county but achieved the highest Democratic vote share in its history, becoming the first Democrat to lose a presidential election while carrying Johnson County since 1896.

This leftward shift was mirrored in the state’s Senate races, where Democrats won Johnson County in 2020 and 2022, despite losing statewide. Once a solid Republican base, the county now leans Democratic at the national level, reflecting broader trends in Kansas’s suburban areas.

On November 8, 2020, Democrats made historic gains in Johnson County, securing a majority on the Board of Commissioners for the first time in the county’s history. In both the 2022 and 2024 elections, Democrats expanded their majority on the Board and flipped the Sheriff’s office for the first time in 96 years.

===State representation===
Johnson County is home to 25 Kansas state representatives and nine Kansas state senators. Thirteen out of 25 of Johnson County&#x27;s representatives are Republicans, as are six of the county&#x27;s nine senators. Numerous Republicans from the area identify as moderates, compared to some of the more ideological hard-liners from other parts of the state. Differences between moderates and the more hard-line members can most commonly be seen on social issues, the most infamous being the numerous debates about the state&#x27;s school finance formula in 2004 and 2014–2018.

===County government and unincorporated areas===
The county government is administered by an elected, seven-member Board of County Commissioners, with six elected from single-member districts and one at-large. Governance of the county is divided into six districts. The county government has full jurisdiction of the unincorporated areas of the county and limited jurisdiction of those areas of the county within incorporated places. For instance, decisions regarding the regulation of land use, development and zoning in unincorporated areas of the county are the responsibility of the county government, whereas such decisions for areas within incorporated places are the jurisdiction of the incorporated city of which the property is a part. 

====Board of Commissioners====

===Sales taxes===
The current sales tax rate in Johnson County is 7.975%, higher than the 6.5% rate in Wyandotte (where Kansas City, Kansas is located). The sales tax rates of each of the surrounding counties are nearly the same as the rate in Johnson County. Individual cities have additional sales taxes.

===Property taxes===
Property taxes are a conglomeration of state, county, city, and school district taxes. Property tax rates are generally lower in Johnson County because property values in the county are higher than in other counties throughout Kansas.

Note: Some cities have multiple tax rates because they are divided among multiple school districts. The above rates are what exist for the majority of residents in the city.

==Law enforcement==
The Johnson County Sheriff&#x27;s Office runs the jails at Olathe and New Century, and patrols the unincorporated parts of Johnson County as well as the cities of Edgerton and DeSoto.

In 2019, the county announced that it is creating a new task force with shared jurisdiction between neighboring Miami and Franklin counties to combat crime.

In April 2024, Johnson County Sheriff Calvin Hayden claimed that he &quot;had a search warrant in hand&quot; when local election officials &quot;decided in a hurry to destroy&quot; ballots from 2019, 2020 and 2021, despite Kansas state law ordering the regular destruction of old ballots, and the local officials having informed Hayden in November 2023 that they would move to destroy the old ballots, which Hayden had asked to be preserved during his investigation of an election software firm. The local prosecutors&#x27; office said that it was &quot;unaware of any search warrant being submitted to a judge for review&quot;. In May 2024, when Hayden was questioned on which judge approved his search warrant, Hayden responded: &quot;there&#x27;s no judge&quot;; when the questioner replied: &quot;A judge has to sign a search warrant to be valid&quot;, Hayden responded: &quot;I didn’t say it was valid&quot;.

==Education==
According to the 2010 Census Bureau, the education attainment of the population 25 years and over: 95.6% high school graduate or higher, 51.1% bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, and 17.9% graduate or professional degree.

==Transportation==
Johnson County has a grid network through most of the county, with a road every mile. The grid has facilitated rapid growth and easy access. Interstate 435 runs through much of the county, and serves as a developmental &quot;border&quot; in the northbound–southbound portion. The westbound–eastbound part of I-435 divides the county into a northern and southern section. The northern section is older, while the southern portion is the fastest-growing area in Johnson County, containing a massive volume of new homes.

The Johnson County numbered street grid generally begins at 47th Street, the Wyandotte County line (the lowest numbered street is 40th Street in Bonner Springs), and is a continuation of the adjacent Kansas City, Missouri, street grid. The grid continues to 215th Street, and into Miami County (with somewhat differently named roads) to 407th Street at the Miami-Linn county line, with most suburban development ending around 167th Street. Named streets in the grid run from State Line Road (1900 West) to County Line Road (40699 West) at the Douglas County line. A portion of the grid extends north from Westwood into the Rosedale area in Kansas City, Kansas.

Another principal highway running through the area is Interstate 35, which runs diagonally through the county, entering it near Downtown Kansas City, and continuing through Olathe and Gardner. Outside the county, it eventually leads to Duluth, Minnesota in the north and the US–Mexico border in the south. U.S. 69 also serves Johnson County, entering from Wyandotte County at the south end of Interstate 635. Much of U.S. 69 within the county is freeway; this freeway eventually heads south and connects to Fort Scott and the rest of southeastern Kansas.

<text>Jewell County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Mankato. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 2,932. The county was named for Lewis Jewell, a lieutenant colonel of the 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1887, Jewell County was established and named for Lieutenant Colonel Lewis R. Jewell of the 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry who died from wounds received in the Battle of Cane Hill. The county lies on the historic Pawnee road, which was crossed by the Pike Exedition in 1806. The first attempt at settlement was made by William Harshberger and his wife on White Rock Creek in 1862, but they were soon driven out by hostile Indian tribes. Subsequent settlement efforts along White Rock Creek in 1866 and 1867 were again subjected to Cheyenne raids in which many settlers were killed, after which the survivors evacuated the county. The Excelsior colony from New York attempted to settle in 1869 but was driven out by June. Despite these dangers, more settlers arrived later that year and into 1870. The first marriage was recorded in the county in 1871.

In response to the persistent threat of Indian raids, settlers formed the &quot;Buffalo Militia&quot; in May 1870 to protect against an anticipated Cheyenne attack. They constructed a fort at what is now Jewell City, which they held until relieved by the Third U.S. Mounted Artillery the following month. After this, there were no further attacks from hostile tribes. The county&#x27;s formal organization began with the appointment of county commissioners in July 1870, followed by an election in September to establish county officials and choose Jewell City as the county seat.

In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (3 miles west of Strong City) to Superior, Nebraska. This branch line connected Strong City, Neva, Rockland, Diamond Springs, Burdick, Lost Springs, Jacobs, Hope, Navarre, Enterprise, Abilene, Talmage, Manchester, Longford, Oak Hill, Miltonvale, Aurora, Huscher, Concordia, Kackley, Courtland, Webber, Superior. At some point, the line from Neva to Lost Springs was pulled but the right of way has not been abandoned. This branch line was originally called &quot;Strong City and Superior line&quot; but later the name was shortened to the &quot;Strong City line&quot;. In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

===Presidential elections===
Like all of Kansas outside the eastern cities, Jewell County is overwhelmingly Republican. The only Democratic presidential candidates to win a majority in the county have been Woodrow Wilson in 1916 and William Jennings Bryan in 1896, and the last Democrat to win a plurality was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Since 1940 only Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 have exceeded 31 percent of the county&#x27;s vote, a devotion to the GOP comparable to famous Appalachia Unionist strongholds like Avery County, North Carolina, or Grant County, West Virginia.

===Laws===
Although the Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 to allow the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with the approval of voters, Jewell County restaurants serve only 3.2 beer and no hard alcohol.

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Jefferson County was established, and was named for President Thomas Jefferson. Settlement of the county was slowed by events prior to and during the Civil War, but the present day unincorporated community of Thompsonville (3 miles northwest of Perry on the Delaware River) was the first established in 1851 by Mormon settlers who initially refused to accompany the main group led by Brigham Young to the Salt Lake Valley. The settlement was first abandoned due to the violence resulting from the border wars, but was re-established when the Civil War ended.

<text>Haskell County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Sublette. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 3,780. The county was named after Dudley Haskell, a congressman during the 1870s and 1880s.

==History==

For millennia, the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by nomadic Native Americans.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.

Haskell County was founded in 1887. It was named for Dudley C. Haskell, a former member of Congress.

===Origin of the Spanish flu pandemic===
Historian John M. Barry concluded that Haskell County was the location of the first outbreak of the 1918 flu pandemic (nicknamed &quot;Spanish flu&quot;), which killed between 21 and 100 million people. Loring Miner, a Haskell County doctor, warned the editors of &quot;Public Health Reports&quot; of the U.S. Public Health Service about the new and more deadly variant of the virus. It produced the common influenza symptoms with a new intensity: &quot;violent headache and body aches, high fever, non-productive cough... This was violent, rapid in its progress through the body, and sometimes lethal. This influenza killed. Soon dozens of patients—the strongest, the healthiest, the most robust people in the county—were being struck down as suddenly as if they had been shot.&quot; Barry writes that in the first six months of 1918, Miner&#x27;s warning of &quot;the influenza of a severe type&quot; was the only reference in that journal to influenza anywhere in the world. 
Haskell County, Kansas, is the first recorded instance anywhere in the world of an outbreak of influenza so unusual that a physician warned public health officials. It remains the first recorded instance suggesting that a new virus was adapting, violently, to man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If the virus did not originate in Haskell, there is no good explanation for how it arrived there. There were no other known outbreaks anywhere in the United States from which someone could have carried the disease to Haskell and no suggestions of influenza outbreaks in either newspapers or reflected in vital statistics anywhere else in the region. And unlike the 1916 outbreak in France, one can trace with perfect definiteness the route of the virus from Haskell to the outside world.

Miner&#x27;s report was not published until April 1918 and it failed to collect the attention it needed. It was not until after 2000 that historians&#x27; research revealed the origin of one of the deadliest epidemics in human history.

Historians have generally reported that the path of the disease from Haskell to the world occurred when newly inducted soldiers from the county traveled 200 miles from the county to Camp Funston (now Fort Riley) and were then deployed to Europe at the beginning of United States involvement in World War I.

However, Haskell County&#x27;s role in the pandemic is widely disputed. Many pathologists believe that Haskell County did not play a role in the virus&#x27;s origin and that historical accounts are entirely coincidental.

===Surviving the Dust Bowl===
The railroad and the development of oil and gas fields in the 1930s, and the locating of many deep wells for irrigation significantly improved the economy of the area helping overcome the &quot;dust bowl&quot; of that period. Haskell County was one of the hardest hit counties in the Midwest during the drought of 1930–1937.

The first rodeo and fair was held in Sublette in 1916 and the fair continues at the same location. The first school district was founded in Santa Fe in 1887. Amanda I. Watkins, who owned a considerable amount of land in the county, was named &quot;World Wheat Queen&quot; in 1926.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.06%) is water.

Haskell County is the flattest county in Kansas.

There were 1,481 households, out of which 43.60% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 69.40% were married couples living together, 5.90% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.10% were non-families. 20.10% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.20% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.88 and the average family size was 3.35.

In the county, the population was spread out, with 32.90% under the age of 18, 9.10% from 18 to 24, 27.80% from 25 to 44, 19.50% from 45 to 64, and 10.60% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females there were 103.30 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.30 males.

The median income for a household in the county was $38,634, and the median income for a family was $43,354. Males had a median income of $31,296 versus $22,857 for females.

==Government==

===Presidential elections===
As do most counties in rural western Kansas, Haskell County leans heavily Republican. The last time Haskell County was carried by a Democratic presidential nominee was 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson won the county as part of his nationwide landslide victory.
===Laws===
Although the Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 to allow the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with the approval of voters, Haskell County remained a prohibition, or &quot;dry&quot;, county until 2023, after voters in the county approved the 1986 amendment with a 30% food sales requirement.

<text>Harvey County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Newton. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 34,024. The county was named for James Harvey, a U.S. senator and 5th governor of Kansas.

==History==
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.

In 1871, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway extended a main line from Emporia to Newton. The next year, in 1872, Harvey County was founded from portions of McPherson, Marion, and Sedgwick counties, and named in honor of the fifth Governor of Kansas James M. Harvey, with Newton designated the county seat.

The first settlers arrived in 1869, and by 1871, there was already significant pressure to organize a new county in what was then the northern portion of Sedgwick County, an effort which succeeded in 1872. The early years of Harvey County&#x27;s government were dogged by persistent public discontent over missing records and financial irregularities, but by the mid-1870s confidence in the county&#x27;s government was restored and the county grew rapidly, particularly with the arrival of large numbers of Mennonite settlers in 1872.

The county developed quickly, with churches, schools, and businesses established within a few years of its founding. Despite early hardship from prairie fires, storms, and the devastating grasshopper plague of 1874, Harvey County rebounded with strong agricultural output and infrastructure improvements. The county&#x27;s abundant water resources, fertile farmland, and natural materials like gypsum and limestone further strengthened its economy. By 1910, Harvey County had a population of 19,200 and no public debt, a rare achievement among Kansas counties at that time.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water. The Little Arkansas River flows through the county.

The racial makeup of the county was 91.04% White, 1.59% Black or African American, 0.52% Native American, 0.52% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 4.17% from other races, and 2.14% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.97% of the population.

There were 12,581 households, out of which 32.80% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.20% were married couples living together, 7.70% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.00% were non-families. 25.80% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.60% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.50 and the average family size was 3.00.

The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.50 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.60 males.

The median income for a household in the county was $40,907, and the median income for a family was $48,793. Males had a median income of $35,037 versus $22,492 for females. The per capita income for the county was $18,715.

<text>Harper County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Anthony. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 5,485. The county was named for Sergeant Marion Harper of the 2nd Kansas Cavalry, who died in battle during the American Civil War.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, Harper County was established.

The original organization of Harper County was one of the largest frauds in county government. In 1873, a group of three men organized Harper County, designating the then fictitious city of &quot;Bluff City&quot; as the county seat. The petition for organization used several names out of a Cincinnati city directory to represent as residents of Harper County. In 1874, the state attorney general investigated, and found not a single resident of the county. The &quot;founders&quot; of the county had sold $40,000 worth of bonds.

Harper County was settled starting in 1877, and the county was organized for a second time in 1878 by the Glenn and Robinson families. Since Bluff City could not be shown to have existed, Anthony was designated as the temporary county seat. In an election in 1879, Anthony won as county seat even though 2,960 votes were cast in a county with 800 legal voters.

===21st century===
Due to new and high-paying jobs at area oil fields and wind farms, Harper County experienced an economic boom; as of 2012, rental housing and office space in towns such as Danville, Harper, and Anthony had more than quadrupled in price, in properties ranging from double-wide trailers to a Carnegie library. However, by 2016, the oil fracking boom had largely played out and the economies of Harper and adjacent counties suffered under the impact. Earthquakes, due to induced seismicity from injection wells, had also substantially reduced in frequency and intensity, thanks to a Kansas Corporation Commission order mandating cutbacks in volumes and pressures. SandRidge Energy, which along with Chesapeake Energy was one of the two major producers in Harper county, appealed the order, but soon went into bankruptcy.

<text>Hamilton County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Syracuse. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 2,518. The county was founded in 1873 and named for Alexander Hamilton, a founding father of the United States.

==History==
In 1873, Hamilton County was established and named for Alexander Hamilton, though its boundaries were later expanded in 1883 to include parts of present-day Grant, Kearny, and Stanton counties. In 1887 the original boundaries were restored. Many early American exploring expeditions, including those led by Zebulon Pike in 1806 and Stephen Long in 1820, passed through the county. Fort Aubrey, established in 1865 near what would become Mayline, briefly served as a military post. The first permanent settlement came in 1872 when a colony from Syracuse, New York, selected land in the county, though their attempt to rename the county to Onondaga was unsuccessful.

By early 1886, the county&#x27;s population had grown enough to seek formal organization. A petition signed by 250 citizens led Governor John A. Martin to authorize a census, which confirmed 1,893 residents. On January 29, 1886, Hamilton County was officially organized, initially encompassing Stanton and parts of Kearny and Grant counties. Kendall was named the temporary county seat, but a battle for the permanent designation ensued between Kendall and Syracuse. Allegations of election fraud led to a Supreme Court ruling invalidating Syracuse&#x27;s initial victory, but a second vote in November 1886 confirmed Syracuse as the county seat.

The dispute continued for several years, with two rival sets of county officials and divided records until the Kansas Supreme Court finally ruled in favor of Syracuse. The arrival of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad hastened the county&#x27;s development, and by 1910, Hamilton County had eight townships, 27 school districts, and high schools in Coolidge and Syracuse.

In the 1930s, the prosperity of the area was severely affected by its location within the Dust Bowl. This catastrophe intensified the economic impact of the Great Depression in the region.

<text>Greeley County is a county located in western Kansas, in the Central United States. Its county seat and largest city is Tribune. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,284, making it the least populous county in Kansas. As of 2018, it is tied with Wallace County as the least densely populated county in the state. The county is named after Horace Greeley, editor of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, who encouraged western settlement with the motto &quot;Go West, young man&quot;.

==History==
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, and Kansas became the 34th U.S. state in 1861. In 1873, Greeley County was established. It was the last county in the state to be organized, which finally occurred in July 1888 after a lawsuit to stop organization on the basis of insufficient population was dismissed. Tribune was named the temporary county seat, defeating Horace in an election held that November.

Settlement in Greeley County was sparse until 1885, when the influx of settlers led to numerous town claims, with Horace, Tribune, and Reid among the settlements that boasted banks, newspapers, and basic amenities. The Missouri Pacific Railroad&#x27;s arrival in 1887, with a depot at Tribune, facilitated further development. By 1910, the population had significantly increased, leading to the establishment of 13 school districts and a scattering of post offices including at Tribune, Horace, Hurt, Sidney, Thelma, and Youngville.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , all of which is land. It is the largest of five United States counties and twelve (Virginia) independent cities that officially have no water area.

The county&#x27;s landscape is predominantly prairie, with an elevation between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. White Woman Creek, the county&#x27;s most notable watercourse, often runs dry.

==Government==

===County===
As of January 1, 2009, Greeley County and the City of Tribune have operated as a unified government. The resulting government consists of a five-member commission with two members elected by city residents, two by rural residents, and one at-large. Similar to Wyandotte County, the only other consolidated city-county in the state, part of the county was not included: Horace decided against consolidation.

===Presidential elections===
This county is often carried by Republican candidates, as are most rural western Kansas counties. The last time a Democratic candidate won the county was in 1976, and a Democratic candidate has only won the county three times in its history: 1932 (Franklin D. Roosevelt), 1964 (Lyndon B. Johnson), and most recently in 1976 by Jimmy Carter.
===Laws===
The Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 to allow the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with the approval of voters. Greeley County remained a prohibition, or &quot;dry&quot;, county until 2008, when voters approved to allow sales of liquor by the drink.

===Townships===
Greeley County was previously divided into three townships. However, in 1992, Colony Township and Harrison Township were merged into Tribune Township, leaving only one township for the county. This was not reported to the U.S. census until 2006, thus the 2000 census did not reflect the merger, but the 2010 census did.

None of the cities within the county are considered &quot;governmentally independent&quot;, and all figures for the townships include those of the cities. In the following table, the population center is the largest city (or cities) included in that township&#x27;s population total, if it is of a significant size.

<text>Grant County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and only city is Ulysses. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 7,352. Both the county and its seat are named after Ulysses Grant, the 18th President of the United States.

==History==

In 1873, the part of Kansas west of Range 25 was divided into 25 new counties. The new counties were Decatur, Rawlins, Cheyenne, Sheridan, Thomas, Sherman, Lane, Buffalo, Foote, Meade, Scott, Sequoyah, Arapahoe, Seward, Wichita, Kearny, Greeley, Hamilton, Stanton, Kansas, Stevens, and Grant.

Grant County, Kansas was named after Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States (1869–1877), and incumbent president at the time of the county&#x27;s formation. The initial survey establishing county boundaries was in the summer of 1874.

In 1883, Kearny, Sequoyah, Arapahoe, Kansas, Stevens, Meade, Clark and Grant counties disappeared. Hamilton, Ford, Seward, and Hodgeman counties enlarged and Finney County was created. Grant County was split with the western portion becoming a part of Hamilton County and the eastern portion becoming a part of the newly created Finney County.

On June 9, 1888, Grant County was again established as a Kansas county, with original county boundaries, with the first officers of the new Grant County being sworn in on June 18, 1888.

<text>Gove County is a county in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat is Gove City, and its most populous city is Quinter. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 2,718. The county was named for Granville Gove, a captain of Company G of the 11th Kansas Cavalry Regiment Volunteer Cavalry, who died from battle wounds during the American Civil War.

==History==

===Early history===

Eighty million years ago, Gove County was part of an ancient inland sea known as the Western Interior Seaway. Many students still visit the Castle Rock Badlands today to explore fossils.

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but kept the title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern-day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000-square-mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized; then in 1861, Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1868, Gove County was established and named for Granville Llewellyn Gove, member of the 11th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, and son of Moses Gove, a former mayor of Manhattan, Kansas.

=== 21st century ===

In 2020, &quot;USA Today&quot; profiled Gove County during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and called it the &quot;deadliest place in America&quot; due to it having the highest death rate from COVID-19 compared to any other county in the nation: One out of every 132 people. The first deaths were reported on October 7; as of November 2020, 20 residents died from the virus, and 314 other positive cases were reported. The article attributed the high death rate to predominant public opposition towards wearing face masks, doubts over the pandemic&#x27;s severity, and the county&#x27;s high median age, all of which left residents highly vulnerable.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. Geary County was formed on August 30, 1855, as an original county from open, free territory. It was among the first 33 counties established by the territory government.

Geary County was originally named Davis County in 1855 after Jefferson Davis (then the United States Secretary of War). During the American Civil War, when Davis became president of the Confederacy, attempts were made to change the county&#x27;s name, but both failed. Federal and state census records show it as Davis County from 1860 through 1885. In 1888 the county was renamed in honor of John W. Geary, an early Governor of the Kansas Territory.

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

The area was included in a treaty ceding land to the Osage Nation in 1808, and ceded back to the federal government in 1825. After 1825 and prior to 1867, treaties with various Indian nations set off parts of what was later to become Franklin County for the use of Indian tribes removed from their ancestral lands. These tribes included: Ottawa, Chippewa, Sac and Fox, Peoria, and Potawatomi.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized under the provisions of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. In 1855, Franklin County was established as one of the 33 original Kansas Territory counties created by the first Territorial Legislature of 1855. The county was named after Benjamin Franklin.

<text>Ford County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Dodge City. As of the 2020 census, its population was 34,287. The county was named in honor of James Ford, a brevet brigadier general during the American Civil War.

==History==
One of the earliest military posts in Kansas, Fort Atkinson, was located in Ford County. Fort Dodge, established in 1864, was on the north bank of the Arkansas River, about five miles southeast of what would become Dodge City. During the California Gold Rush in 1849, thousands of gold seekers passed through the area along the Santa Fe Trail, but few settled there.

Ford County was established in 1867 and named for Colonel James H. Ford of the Second Colorado Cavalry, who was in charge of the construction of Fort Dodge after the Civil War. The region had been frequently traveled by pioneers along the Santa Fe Trail since the early 19th century.

The town of Dodge City was established in 1872 upon the completion of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad. Before the buffalo were wiped out, their hides were extensively shipped from Dodge City. Dodge City would later develop into a rough and tumble cowtown during the peak cattle drive years of 1875–1885.

<text>Finney County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Garden City. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 38,470. The county was named for David Finney, the Lieutenant Governor of Kansas from 1881 to 1885. In 2020, 51.4 percent of the population in the county was Hispanic, one of a few counties in Kansas with a Hispanic majority population.

==History==
Finney County was established in 1867 and named after Lt. Gov. John W. Finney. The first white settlers arrived in 1878, settling along the Arkansas River and its tributaries.

Finney County began &quot;circa&quot; 1880 as Buffalo County and Sequoyah County, named after Sequoyah, the Cherokee Indian responsible for the development of the Cherokee alphabet. The two counties were merged and renamed Finney County, in honor of then Lieutenant Governor David Wesley Finney. The county grew to the current shape after Garfield County was annexed to it in 1893. The northeastern block, separate from the otherwise rectangular area, represents what at one time was Garfield County, which is now occupied partially by the Garfield Township.

The town of Garden City was founded in 1879 by the cattle firm of Jones and Plummer, who established it as a shipping point for Texas cattle being driven along the Jones &amp; Plummer Trail to Dodge City. Garden City grew rapidly as a railroad hub when the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe and Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific railroads arrived in 1888.

As described in Blackmar&#x27;s Cyclopedia, Garden City &quot;was a typical frontier town, with its gambling houses, dance halls and other adjuncts of border civilization&quot; in its early years, but it quickly transformed into an agricultural center for southwestern Kansas.

Other early settlements such as Holcomb, Kalvesta, and Pierceville sprang up in the 1880s as Finney County became a prosperous region for wheat farming and cattle ranching. The county population boomed from just 537 in 1880 to over 5,000 by 1890 as homesteaders poured in.

In 1893, the former Garfield County was annexed into Finney County and organized as Garfield Township. Garfield County had originally been established in 1887 from parts of Finney County and other surrounding counties, but it struggled to maintain a viable tax base and population.

By 1910, Finney County had a population exceeding 10,000 as agriculture firmly took root in the region after its pioneering days on the frontier.

Between 2007 and 2008 Finney County became majority-minority.

<text>Ellsworth County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Ellsworth. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 6,376. The county was named after Fort Ellsworth.

==History==
===Early history===
From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America both east and west of the Mississippi River. In 1762, after losing the French and Indian War to Great Britain, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1763 France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain.

It regained the western territory under Napoleon, who sold it in 1803 to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. He had decided to get rid of the New World territories after failing to regain control of Saint-Domingue, where a slave rebellion had toppled colonial control. In 1804 Haiti declared independence as the second republic of the Western Hemisphere.

The Plains Indians retained control of much of their territory until the late 19th century, giving way finally before superior United States arms and technology. Their territories were invaded by settlers, and crossed by the development of improved routes for settlers&#x27; emigrant wagon trains to the West Coast, followed by more permanent construction of transcontinental railroads. These brought tens of thousands of settlers to the Plains.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized; and in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. Ellsworth County was established February 26, 1867. The county was named after the old Fort Ellsworth, named in honor of 2nd Lieutenant Allen Ellsworth of the 7th Iowa Cavalry (Company H), who supervised construction of the fort in 1864 during the American Civil War. On November 17, 1866, the fort was renamed Fort Harker in honor of General Charles Garrison Harker who had died on June 27, 1864, from wounds received in an abortive offensive action in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. The fort was subsequently moved to a new site about one mile to the northeast, and the old fort&#x27;s remaining buildings were ordered torn down in June 1867.

On March 22, 1869, Fourteen Pawnee Indians, including scouts who had been honorably discharged after working for the army, were traveling through Ellsworth County when they ran into U.S. cavalry troops. Though the Pawnees had discharge papers from the army, a fight ensued. The Indians retreated to a sandstone cave, known today as Palmer&#x27;s Cave. Their attackers set fire to grass at the cave&#x27;s entrance, and six to nine Pawnees were killed as they ran out. The others died from exposure without their possessions. A few days later, the post surgeon at nearby Fort Harker, in today&#x27;s town of Kanopolis, removed six heads from their bodies, and shipped them to the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C., for cranial study.

In the later 19th century, this area became known for cattle ranching and cattle drives. Town life was often riotous with cowboys celebrating after long drives.

<text>Ellis County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Hays. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 28,934.
The county was named for George Ellis, a first lieutenant of the Twelfth Kansas Infantry.
Ellis County is the official German Capital of Kansas. German immigrants settled in Hays, Ellis, Victoria, and nearby villages in the 1870s and 1880s.

==History==
===19th century===
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.

Ellis County was established by an act of the state legislature on February 16, 1873, which defined the original borders of the county as: 
The first settlers had been arriving since May 1867, with Fort Fletcher (later Fort Hays) having been built in 1865.

Independent county government was established in October 1867, by proclamation of Governor Samuel J. Crawford in response to a petition.
Hays was chosen as the permanent seat by an election in April 1870.
Early settlers the Lull brothers, from Salina, had in May 1867 begun a town called Rome just north of the railroad route and on the west of Big Creek, expecting that to become the county seat.
It gained a general supply store, Bloomfield, Moses &amp; Co, the following month, and a hotel run by Joseph Perry.
However, the Big Creek Land Company platted a competing town named Hays City on the east of Big Creek, which gained the important support of the railroad company.
Rome disappeared, with Perry&#x27;s hotel and several other of its buildings being relocated to Hays City.

Ellis County was named for George Ellis, first lieutenant of the Twelfth Kansas Infantry.

The county&#x27;s early newspapers were the &quot;Star-Sentinel&quot;, &quot;Hays City Times&quot;, and &quot;Ellis County Free Press&quot; published in Hays City; and the &quot;Ellis Head-Light&quot; and &quot;Ellis Review&quot; published in Ellis.

==== English and Russian-German immigrants ====
The initial wave of settlement was slow, with three colonies being established in 1872.

George Grant, a wealthy Scottish merchant, purchased of land that year, and some 300 farmers from England settled there over the next two years.
Grant bought the land from the Kansas Pacific Railroad with the intention of creating a community of British aristocrats and agriculturalists in the middle of rural Kansas.
His first town was Victoria named after Queen Victoria where Victoria Manor, a two story stone structure, acted as temporary housing for the immigrants and as a transport depot for the Kansas Pacific.

Grant&#x27;s sales pitch to the immigrants was that it was cheaper to buy land in Kansas at per acre (Grant himself having purchased it at per acre) than it was to buy land in Britain, and that Grant would till the land and seed it with imported British stock.

The first wave of young British aristocratic families set sail on April 1, 1873. Stories of the time recorded them as not becoming agriculturalists, as Grant had hoped, but mainly indulging in aristocratic pursuits whilst living off family remittances, including hunting the local wildlife.

Another story recounts them placing a dam across Big Creek to make a lake between Victoria and Hays which they then sailed across in a steamboat until the dam was broken by a flood; although at the time of the Ellis County centennial in the 1970s, one local resident expressed doubts at the historical veracity of this tale, considering the geography of Big Creek in that area.

However, whilst Grant himself put in great effort to start the colony, including importing Black Angus cattle and running his own cattle farm to the south of Victoria, he died in 1878 and after his death all of the British aristocrats returned to Britain.

A plague of grasshoppers in 1874 drove many emigres away, to be replaced in 1875 by many Russian immigrants.

The Russian immigrants were, strictly speaking, Volga Germans who had settled in Russia in 1760. The Russification policies begun in 1871 by Alexander II, and especially the January 13, 1874 reversal of the original decree that had exempted them from conscription into the Russian military when they had settled in Russia in the first place, prompted them to look to the United States and elsewhere.

Five delegates originally went on a ten-day exploratory mission to Nebraska. In December 1874, a four-person delegation went to Topeka and Larned in Kansas, reporting unfavourably on what they found. In the meantime the first Germans had been conscripted in November 1874, spurring many to emigrate anyway, which they did arriving in Baltimore on November 23, 1875 and in Topeka on the 28th of that month.

Initially deterred from homesteading by the per acre price of land in North Topeka, they were escorted on three tours of Ellis County by A. Roedelheiner of the Kansas Pacific.

Their initial tour of land around Hog Back almost persuaded the immigrants to return to Russia, but they were shown further land on the Smoky Hill River and near what was to become Catherine and Herzog.
This Ellis land was cheaper at per acre, and so on February 21, 1876 fourteen German families came to Hays and from there moved to Liebenthal in Rush County.
Three families from Katherinenstadt in Russia also came to Hays on March 1, 1876 and, whilst temporarily renting accommodation therein, built their homes in Catherine to which they moved on April 8.

Twenty-three families settled in the failing British colony at Victoria on April 8, 1876, settling on the east bank of Victoria Creek just west of where Victoria now exists.
Another large wave of immigrants left Russia in June 1876, and some of them arrived in Hays on July 26, 1876 and in Catherine the next day.
Others took a different route and arrived and settled in Topeka. Thirteen of the families arrived in Hays on August 20, 1876 and settled in Pfeifer the next day.

One of the largest groups of immigrants was 104 families (originally to be 108, but four had been held back because family members had been conscripted, which legally prevented them from emigrating from Russia) in 1876.

The Mennonites in the group settled in Nebraska, while the others arrived in Victoria on August 3, 1876 and thereafter settled in Herzog. The settlers of Munjor stayed in Herzog for two months, before settling on Big Creek, just north of the present location of Munjor.

A small wave of immigrants followed the first wave to Pfeifer in late September 1876, with another small wave from Katherinenstadt arriving in Catherine on September 26.
The last wave of immigrants in 1876 settled in Munjor.

The German immigrants founded Schoenchen in 1877, some coming directly from Schoenchen in Russia, with others coming from Liebenthal in Rush County. Their original plan had been to move from Liebenthal to another site in Rush, but the place that they had chosen was school land that they could not afford, meaning that they could not deed enough of it to the community to erect their church, whilst at the same time land for a church had been deeded in Liebenthal.

In recrimination, the Rush County settlers moved to Ellis, joining the direct immigrant party at Schoenchen in April and May 1877.
Two other small waves came that year, one to Catherine on August 6, 1877 from Katherinenstadt, and one to Pfiefer from Pfiefer and Kamenka in Russia.

Immigration began to wane in 1878, with a party from Katherinenstadt arriving on June 20 to settle in Herzog and Pfeifer, and another party from Obermonjour in late July/early August. By this point, property prices had been depressed back in Russia by all of the sales made by the preceding emigrants, and further emigrants were now emigrating at a net loss. Another party, having had to cover the Russian emigration fees through deceit, claiming that two of their number had died to officials who only dealt with the two people who left the train, since the party collectively had not enough money for all even though they had pooled their funds, arrived in Herzog and Munjor and was the last large wave of Volga German immigrants to Ellis.

By 1903, there had been 222 immigrants to Catherine, some going elsewhere afterwards. Munjor grew from 130 families and 794 people in 1897 to 156 families and 931 people by 1900.
The largest of the Volga German settlements was Herzog, having roughly 1700 people (measured from church congregation size as accounted in the &quot;Victoria Chronicle&quot;) in 1895, with Pfeifer and Schoenchen coming fourth and fifth.

===20th century===
In 1942, the Walker Army Airfield was built northwest of Walker. Thousands were stationed at the airfield for training of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress during World War II. The airfield was abandoned and most of it razed .

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.05%) is water.

===Geology and hydrology===
The county is crossed by the Saline River across the north, with its principal branch being Eagle Creek.
Other rivers include Big Creek, with its principal tributary Victoria Creek, which is in turn a tributary of the Smoky Hill River which flows across the south.
The county had several salt marshes in 1886.

The river banks had a lot of limestone, and around Hays City in the 19th century there were great quantities of clay.

==Demographics==
The Hays Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Ellis County.

In 1886, the population was 5.842, having risen from 5,046 in 1885.
In 1910, the population was 12,170.

, there were 27,507 people, 11,193 households, and 6,771 families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 12,078 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 96.10% White, 0.67% Black or African American, 0.21% Native American, 0.82% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 1.31% from other races, and 0.89% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.37% of the population.

There were 11,193 households, out of which 28.80% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.00% were married couples living together, 7.80% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.50% were non-families. 30.10% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.80% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 and the average family size was 2.96.

In the county, the population was spread out, with 22.40% under the age of 18, 18.40% from 18 to 24, 25.20% from 25 to 44, 19.60% from 45 to 64, and 14.30% who were 65 years of age or older.

About 6.50% of families and 12.90% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.20% of those under age 18 and 10.00% of those age 65 or over.

==Government==

===Presidential elections===
Ellis County is an anomaly in western Kansas, having voted several times for Democratic presidential candidates, even when the vast majority of the state&#x27;s 105 counties went for the Republican nominee. This is due to the county&#x27;s distinctive (in Kansas) German Catholic heritage, contrasting with the Southern “Bible Belt” or Yankee heritage of most rural Kansas counties. It was the solitary county in Kansas to support Catholic Al Smith over Herbert Hoover in 1928, when Kansas was Hoover&#x27;s strongest state nationwide, and also was won by John F. Kennedy in 1960 by almost thirty percent as one of only two Kansas counties to back the Massachusetts senator. Ellis County bucked the national and statewide trend by voting for Michael Dukakis over winner George H. W. Bush in the 1988 presidential election, one of only three Kansas counties to go for Dukakis. Ellis County gave a plurality to Bill Clinton over Bush and Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential election, but has been solidly in the Republican column since, giving 66 percent to Republican John McCain to 32 percent for Democrat Barack Obama in the 2008 election, higher than the 57 percent McCain won statewide.

===Laws===
Wild Bill Hickok served as sheriff in 1870. Ellis County was a prohibition, or &quot;dry&quot;, county until the Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 and voters approved the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with a 30% food sales requirement. The food sales requirement was removed with voter approval in 1988.

==Education==

**eastern third of county to Russell county line
* Hays USD 489
**extends to Rooks and Rush county lines and approximately five miles each way on I-70 from city center

===Private schools===

* St. Mary&#x27;s Elementary in Ellis
* Thomas More Prep-Marian High in Hays

===Universities and Colleges===

==Communities==

Many settlements in Ellis are named after the original settlements in Russia from which the Volga Germans immigrated, including Catherine from Katherinenstatd (a.k.a. Baronsk and founded in 1765 by Baron de Beauregard), Shoenchen (a.k.a. Paninskoje and founded in 1767), Pfeifer (a.k.a. Gniluska and founded in 1766), Herzog (founded in 1764), and Munjor from Obermonjour (founded 1766) and Neo-Obermonjour (founded 1859).

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, after first serving as an area to relocate Native American tribes from the east, the United States organized Kansas Territory. In 1861, Kansas was admitted as the 34th U.S. state. The area that today is Elk County was, for a brief period, reserved to the Osage Indians as hunting grounds for buffalo and other game. In 1867, when Howard County was formed, it encompassed both present day Elk and Chautauqua counties. Disputes over county seats caused a division. In 1875, Elk County was established, named for the Elk River.

The first railroad in Elk County was built in 1879. It connected cattle ranches and farms to eastern markets.

N.C. Boles became the first postmaster in the county with the opening of the Peters post office at Kinsley, then known as Petersboro in 1873. Kinsley&#x27;s present name honors E.W. Kinsley, a Bostonian who generously funded the construction of the first church edifice, a Congregationalist building completed in 1875.

The infamous grasshopper raid of 1874 decimated crops, leaving many residents without means to sustain themselves. The county commissioners petitioned Governor Osborn for aid, emphasizing the plight of families and advocating for work programs over handouts.

<text>Douglas County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Lawrence. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 118,785, making it the fifth-most populous county in Kansas. The county was named after Stephen Douglas, a U.S. Senator from Illinois and advocate for the popular sovereignty choice in the Kansas slavery debate.

Douglas County comprises the Lawrence, KS Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Kansas City-Overland Park-Kansas City, MO-KS Combined Statistical Area.

==History==

===Early history===

For millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France via the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso, although the former country kept title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

===19th century===
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Douglas County was established. Douglas County was opened for settlement on May 15, 1854, and was named for Stephen A. Douglas, a senator from Illinois. The county was practically at the center of the Bleeding Kansas years as leaders in Lecompton (the territorial capital) wanted Kansas to be a slave state, whereas leaders in Lawrence wanted Kansas to be a free state. The pro- and anti-slavery settlers held great animosity towards one another, leading to many events, such as the drafting of the Lecompton Constitution (which would have admitted Kansas into the Union as a slave state), the Wakarusa War (1855), the Sack of Lawrence (1856), Battle of Black Jack (1856), and the Lawrence Massacre (1863).

The first railroad in Douglas County, the Kansas Pacific, was built through that territory in 1864.

==Government==

===County===
In recent years, since the 1990s, the Democratic Party has been dominant in Douglas County. Democrats control all County-wide offices in the county. Douglas County is currently served by county commissioners Patrick Kelly, Shannon Reid, and Karen Willey, all are Democrats. According to the Kansas Secretary of State&#x27;s office, as of July 2021, there were 35,146 registered Democrats, 22,324 registered Republicans, 900 registered Libertarians, and 21,474 Independents in the county.

===State===
Democratic state representatives representing portions of the county include Eileen Horn (10th District), Barbara Ballard (44th District), Mike Amyx (45th District), and Dennis Highberger (46th District); Republican state representatives include Jim Karleskint (42nd District), and Ken Corbet (54th District). The three state senators representing the county, Marci Francisco (2nd District), Tom Holland (3rd District), and Anthony Hensley (19th District), are all Democrats.

===Presidential elections===
Douglas County has a political history more typical of Vermont and Maine than of the Great Plains. This is due to the county&#x27;s strong New England roots. It voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election between 1864 and 1960, except in 1912 when the GOP was mortally divided and the county supported Progressive Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt would later rejoin the GOP. The county reverted to form and gave Republican presidential nominees over 60 percent of the vote in every election between 1920 and 1960 (except 1932 when Herbert Hoover received 58.7 percent).

This tradition was broken in 1964, when the conservative sentiment and Western origins of Barry Goldwater drove the county into Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s hands, making Johnson the first Democrat ever to carry the county. Even then, however, Goldwater managed 45 percent of the county&#x27;s vote. With more moderate GOP candidates, the GOP carried the county in every election between 1968 and 1988. During this time, Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Michael Dukakis in 1988 were the only Democrats to come reasonably close to carrying the county.

However, the growing transformation of Lawrence into a liberal academic center has pulled the county into the Democratic column in every election since 1992. This was typical of many counties around the country dominated by college towns. In 2004, John Kerry became only the second Democrat to win a majority of the county&#x27;s vote. Since then, Douglas County has been one of the most Democratic counties in Kansas. In 2016 and 2020, for instance, Donald Trump turned in the worst showings on record for a Republican in the county without the presence of a credible third-party challenger on the ballot.

===Laws===
The county overwhelmingly voted &quot;No&quot; on the 2022 Kansas abortion referendum, an anti-abortion ballot measure, by 81% to 19%, outpacing its support of Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential election.

===Law enforcement===
The Douglas County Sheriff&#x27;s office has two divisions, Corrections, which operates a 185-bed jail, and Operations. The Operations Division includes a dive team, a patrol, and a warrants unit. The department works with other local police agencies at the University of Kansas, Lawrence Police Department, Eudora, and Baldwin City. the sheriff is Jay T. Armbrister.

<text>Doniphan County is the northeasternmost county in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat is Troy, and its most populous city is Wathena. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 7,510. The county was named after Alexander Doniphan, a Mexican–American War hero. It is bounded on the east by the Missouri River, to the south by Atchison County and to the west by Brown County.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, while keeping title to approximately 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. Doniphan County was established on August 25, 1855, then organized on September 18, 1855. It is named for the U.S. cavalry commander Colonel Alexander W. Doniphan (1808–1887) of Liberty, Missouri, who played an important role in the Mexican–American War. He was a zealous partisan in the failed effort made to extend slavery into Kansas.

==Geography==
Doniphan County is located in the northeastern corner of the state—it is bordered by Nebraska to the north and Missouri to the east. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.2%) is water. It is the third-smallest county in Kansas by land area and second-smallest by total area.

===Geographic features===
The Missouri River defines the border in the north and east. Eight barge lines travel the river, and a Port Authority is located across the river in Saint Joseph, Missouri. The river provides much of the water for the eastern part of the county. Interior cities, such as Troy and Highland, receive their water from underground wells. The Wolf River flows through western portions of the county and north into the Missouri River.

===Major highways===
The only major highway serving the county is U.S. Highway 36, an east–west route traveling through St. Joseph. Troy, Elwood, and Wathena lie along this route. Kansas state highways K-7, K-20, K-120, K-136, K-137, and K-238 serve other areas of the county. K-7 has been designated a scenic byway. (&quot;See the map below.&quot;)

==Government==

===County===
Doniphan County is served by a Board of County Commissioners, composed of one elected official from each of three districts. The commissioners serve four-year terms, with the second and third district elections at two-year intervals after the first district election. The board is responsible for setting the county&#x27;s policies, procedures, and budgets as well as overseeing functions of their respective road and bridge shops. In addition, the board acts as the Board of County Canvassers and canvasses votes cast at each election. The county has adopted comprehensive county planning and zoning codes. The cities are governed by mayors and city councils. Government services are paid for through a sales tax, property tax, and an &quot;ad valorem tax&quot; mill levy.

===Presidential elections===
Owing to its history of settlement by anti-slavery Yankees from Iowa and ultimately New England, Doniphan County became a Republican stronghold and has remained so ever since. The county has voted for the Republican nominee in every presidential election since Kansas became a state, beginning in 1864. With Riley County voting Democratic for the first time in the 2020 election, Doniphan County is the only county in Kansas that has never had at least a plurality for the Democratic nominee. Only on three occasions has the Democratic nominee reached forty percent of Doniphan County&#x27;s vote, all of these in national landslides, and on only seven occasions have the Democrats managed 35 percent of the vote in the county. Doniphan County is one of four counties or county equivalents to have always voted Republican during its history, and of these has the longest unbroken streak of Republican support.

===Laws===
Although the Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 to allow the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with the approval of voters, Doniphan County remained a prohibition, or &quot;dry&quot;, county until 2012.

===Colleges and universities===

<text>Dickinson County is a county in Central Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Abilene. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 18,402. The county was named in honor of Daniel Dickinson, a U.S. Senator from New York that was a Kansas statehood advocate.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.

In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.

===19th century===

In 1857, Dickinson County was founded.

The first railroad in Dickinson County was built through that territory in 1866.

In 1887, Mr. Herington got the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway to build through Herington. He gave the land and right-of-way for Herington to become a division point with shops, two round houses, freight house, bridge yards, telegraph office and many other buildings. He furnished the limestone for the freight house, and for a two-story depot that was and later enlarged to .

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Topeka to Herington. This main line connected Topeka, Valencia, Willard, Maple Hill, Vera, Paxico, McFarland, Alma, Volland, Alta Vista, Dwight, White City, Latimer, Herington.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway extended its main line from Herington to Pratt. This main line connected Herington, Ramona, Tampa, Durham, Waldeck, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Groveland, Inman, Medora, Hutchinson, Whiteside, Partridge, Arlington, Langdon, Turon, Preston, Natrona, Pratt. In 1888, this main line was extended to Liberal. Later, this line was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. This line is called the &quot;Golden State Limited&quot;.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a branch line north–south from Herington to Caldwell. This branch line connected Herington, Lost Springs, Lincolnville, Antelope, Marion, Aulne, Peabody, Elbing, Whitewater, Furley, Kechi, Wichita, Peck, Corbin, Wellington, Caldwell. By 1893, this branch line was incrementally built to Fort Worth, Texas. This line is called the &quot;OKT&quot;.

The Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway was foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (3 miles west of Strong City) to Superior, Nebraska. This branch line connected Strong City, Neva, Rockland, Diamond Springs, Burdick, Lost Springs, Jacobs, Hope, Navarre, Enterprise, Abilene, Talmage, Manchester, Longford, Oak Hill, Miltonvale, Aurora, Huscher, Concordia, Kackley, Courtland, Webber, Superior. At some point, the line from Neva to Lost Springs was pulled but the right of way has not been abandoned. This branch line was originally called &quot;Strong City and Superior line&quot; but later the name was shortened to the &quot;Strong City line&quot;.

In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2010, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was constructed north to south through Dickinson County, with much controversy over tax exemption and environmental concerns. A pumping station named &quot;Hope&quot; was built along the pipeline.

<text>Crawford County is a county located in Southeast Kansas. Its county seat is Girard, and its most populous city is Pittsburg. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 38,972. The county was named in honor of Samuel Crawford, the 3rd governor of Kansas. Pittsburg State University is located in Crawford County.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the British defeated France in the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the former New France land west of the Mississippi to France, but kept title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, the United States acquired much of the West and most of the land for modern-day Kansas as part of the 828,000-square mile Louisiana Purchase, at a cost of 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, and in 1861 Kansas was admitted as the 34th U.S. state. The preceding years had been filled with violence as settlers arrived on both sides of the slavery question; the residents voting for Kansas to enter as a free state were the majority. In 1867, Crawford County was established (formed from Bourbon and Cherokee counties) on the Cherokee Neutral Lands, which were originally established as a buffer zone between the Osage tribe and the State of Missouri. It is named for Samuel J. Crawford, who was the governor in office at the time.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, Crawford County was often referred to as the &quot;Little Balkans&quot;, because of the many immigrants who came here from that area of Europe. They came to work in the mines, industrial work that did not require much English in the beginning. This area was the site of a number of illegal bootlegging operations, most of which were organized by immigrants in order to supplement their meager earnings as strip miners. During his term, Governor Walter R. Stubbs of Kansas made it his mission to stamp out this practice. According to the criminal justice scholar Ken Peak, &quot;The [Little] Balkans drove [Stubbs] absolutely nuts. He had his hands full and sent people down to the Balkans to clean it up&quot;. Despite this crack down, however, the governor was unable to eradicate the crime completely from the area.

===21st century===
On Sunday, May 4, 2003, a violent F4 tornado touched down in western Crawford County, several miles west of Frontenac at around 4:40 p.m. The tornado remained on the ground throughout Crawford County until it entered neighboring Barton County, Missouri—traveling a total of and ending near Liberal, Missouri. The communities of Ringo, Franklin, and Mulberry, all in Crawford County, were devastated. The tornado cut a path of destruction roughly one quarter mile wide. Several F4 tornadoes hit Kansas, Missouri, and several other states that day, including the Kansas City metropolitan area. Six deaths were reported in Kansas, and Governor Sebelius declared much of eastern and southeastern Kansas a disaster area, including Crawford County.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.9%) is water.

==Government==

===Presidential elections===
Unlike most of the counties in the Ozark-Ouachita “Bible Belt”, Crawford County remained competitive in presidential elections until the 2010s. As recently as 2008 it was carried by Barack Obama, being the only county he ever won between the urban limits of Dallas, Little Rock, Denver and Kansas City. However, like all of the region it has shown a strong anti-Democratic trend in recent years, with Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 34.91% – though more than she achieved in any rural white southern county – being the worst by a Democrat since 1924. Democrat Laura Kelly did, however, win the county in her successful 2018 gubernatorial bid.

In earlier times, Crawford County was a hotbed of left-wing politics, being the nation&#x27;s second best county for Eugene Debs in 1912, and one of only four where he gained a plurality of votes. It was also Robert M. La Follette’s second-best Kansas county in 1924, behind only largely Catholic Ellis County.

Only four presidential elections since have seen Crawford County not back the national winner: 1960, 1988, 2012, and 2020.

===Laws===
Crawford County was a prohibition, or &quot;dry&quot;, county until the Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 and voters approved the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with a 30% food sales requirement. The food sales requirement was removed with voter approval in 1992.

The county voted &quot;No&quot; on the 2022 Kansas abortion referendum, an anti-abortion ballot measure, by 55% to 45% despite backing Donald Trump with 60% of the vote to Joe Biden&#x27;s 38% in the 2020 presidential election.

<text>Cowley County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat is Winfield, and its most populous city is Arkansas City. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 34,549. The county was named after Matthew Cowley, first lieutenant in Company I, 9th Kansas Cavalry, who died during the American Civil War.

==History==
For millennia, the land now known as Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans. The first European visitor to Kansas was the Spanish explorer Francisco Vasquez de Coronado in 1541. In 1601, the Governor of New Mexico, Juan de Oñate, visited Etzanoa, a settlement of several thousand Wichita people near Arkansas City along the Walnut River. The ruins of Etzanoa have been found by archaeologists.

===19th century===
In 1803, most of modern Kansas was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. Cowley County was officially organized as a county, but reserved for the Osage Indians, by the Kansas Legislature in March 1867, originally named Hunter County for Robert Mercer Taliaferro Hunter (1809–1887), a Virginia Representative and Senator to Congress and Speaker of the House in the twenty-sixth Congress. In 1870, the county was renamed for Matthew Cowley, First Lieutenant in Company I, 9th Kansas Cavalry, who died at Little Rock, Arkansas, on October 7, 1864. Officially opened for settlement July 15, 1870, there was a lengthy and bitter disagreement between the towns of Winfield and Cresswell (the town now named Arkansas City) over the possession of the county seat of government. Finally settled after two special elections and numerous petitions to the Governor and Legislature, Winfield was determined to be the county seat and a courthouse was constructed in 1873 at a cost of $11,500.

===21st century===
In 2010, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was constructed north to south through Cowley County. Controversy arose from the Kansas legislature&#x27;s decision to grant the pipeline a ten-year exemption from property taxes; it was estimated that this would mean $15 million per year in lost revenue to the six counties through which the pipeline passed. The counties were unsuccessful in an attempt to eliminate the exemption.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water.

West of Dexter, KS, Cowley County Fishing Lake is positioned just off of Highway 166. This fishing lake is the home of the Cowley County Waterfall, which can be visited following the road to the northwest side of the property. However, in recent years (as of 2021) the severe drought has caused the waterfall to stop flowing. It will likely continue if the area receives enough precipitation and ends the drought.

<text>Comanche County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Coldwater. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 1,689. The county was named after the Comanche tribe.

==History==
In 1867, Comanche County was established and named for the Comanche tribe. The first American settlers arrived in 1873. Initially, the land was dominated by cattlemen who took advantage of the open range, many of whom organized a cattle company known as the &quot;Comanche Pool.&quot; A large number of homesteaders arrived to claim and farm the land in 1884, and by 1885 most of the desirable homesteads had been claimed and the fencing in of the open range had ended the dominance of the cattlemen.

The town of Coldwater was founded in 1884 by a group from Harper, Kansas, who saw potential in the northern part of Comanche County. The county organized in 1885 with Coldwater serving as the county seat. The arrival of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad in 1887 boosted prosperity population growth by improving transportation in the county. The opening of the Indian Territory to homesteading led to a temporary depopulation, however, and the dry years from 1891 to 1897 brought economic hardship, reducing the population significantly. The first decades of the 20th century brought economic and population recovery, but the Dust Bowl of the 1930s and subsequent rural flight in the 20th and 21st centuries have significantly impacted the county&#x27;s fortunes.

<text>Cloud County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Concordia. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 9,032. The county was named after William Cloud, an officer in the American Civil War.

==History==
===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, while retaining title to approximately 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, Cloud County was established.

Cloud county was originally named Shirley County, but civic leaders feared that sounded too much like the name of a prostitute. It was then renamed &quot;Cloud&quot; county in honor of Colonel William F. Cloud.

Cloud County was formed from the existing Washington County, Kansas in a joint convention with Republic and Cloud counties. The county was legally organized on September 6, 1866, with Elk Creek designated as the temporary county seat.

In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (3 miles west of Strong City) to Superior, Nebraska. This branch line connected Strong City, Neva, Rockland, Diamond Springs, Burdick, Lost Springs, Jacobs, Hope, Navarre, Enterprise, Abilene, Talmage, Manchester, Longford, Oak Hill, Miltonvale, Aurora, Huscher, Concordia, Kackley, Courtland, Webber, Superior. At some point, the line from Neva to Lost Springs was pulled but the right of way has not been abandoned. This branch line was originally called &quot;Strong City and Superior line&quot; but later the name was shortened to the &quot;Strong City line&quot;. In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

===Major highways===
Cloud County is bisected from north to south by U.S. Route 81, which runs through the town of Concordia and connects north to Belleville, Kansas or south to Salina, Kansas. The southern part of the county also has U.S. Route 24, connecting Clay Center, Kansas from the east and Beloit, Kansas to the west.

<text>Clark County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Ashland. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 1,991. The county was named after Charles Clarke.

==History==

Clark County, Kansas, was established on February 26, 1867, from the territory of the former Peketon County, and named for Charles F. Clarke, a captain in the 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry during the American Civil War, though the final &#x27;e&#x27; was later dropped. As an unorganized county, it was initially attached to Ford County for judicial purposes until 1883, when it was incorporated into Ford County on account of its sparse population and prosperous cattle ranches. This inclusion displeased the settlers of Clark County, and Clark County was again detached from Ford County in March 1885, this time attached to Comanche County for judicial purposes. Clark County was finally organized in May 1885, with the county seat at Ashland.

The opening of the Mount Jesus Trail, passing near a hill in the center of the county named Mount Jesus by the Custer expedition in 1868 on its way from Fort Dodge to Fort Supply, along with the onset of Texas cattle drives through the county, marked the beginning of American settlement in Clark County. Settlement intensified with the establishment of a road ranch by John Glenn in 1874 near present-day Ashland, the beginning of weekly stagecoach service along the Mount Jesus Trail in 1875, and the opening of additional cattle ranches in 1876. Efforts to create a Benedictine colony in the late 1870s near Mount Casino were abandoned after resistance from cattlemen and an Indian raid.

Clark City hosted the first school and newspaper in the county, but both activities shifted to Ashland as the latter town grew, including by direct payments to Clark City residents to relocate. Ultimately Ashland became the county&#x27;s dominant town and was officially designated the county seat in 1885 while Clark City was abandoned. Ashland remains the county seat and principal city of Clark County to this day.

<text>Cheyenne County is a county located in the northwestern corner of the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is St. Francis. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 2,616.
The county was named after the Cheyenne tribe.

==History==
===19th century===
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.

Cheyenne County was established by an act of the state legislature on 1873-03-06, which defined the original borders of the county as: 
The county was surveyed the following year, and its first settlers arrived in 1879.

Early settlement was in and around Wano, the &quot;T&quot; ranch (the county&#x27;s first cattle ranch) being established from there in 1876, and Jacob Buck and the families of A. M. Brenaman, L. R. Heaton, a man named Bateman all settling around the area.
Brenaman was the first postmaster at Wano post office, established on 1880-08-23.
The first storekeepers opened their store the following month, with the first school being Kepferle, and the first school district established on 1881-12-03.
A dedicated school building, for 10 pupils, was donated by F. J. Graham and opened on 1882-01-10.
By 1886 there were 5 school districts.

The name Wano was an Anglicization by the settlers of the Spanish word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;good&quot;.
It was not only the name of the post office but of its first newspaper, the &quot;Wano News&quot;, also run by Brenaman.
Like the county&#x27;s second newspaper, the &quot;Echo&quot;, the &quot;News&quot; was short lived and only had 5 issues.
Later newspapers were the &quot;Cheyenne County Rustler&quot;, established on 1885-07-03 and originally published in Wano and later St Francis; the &quot;Frontiersman&quot;, the &quot;Cheyenne County Democrat&quot;, and the &quot;Bird City News&quot;, all published in Bird City; and the &quot;Plaindealer&quot; published in St Francis.

Independent county government was finally established in April 1886, by proclamation of Governor John A. Martin in response to a petition from the previous month.
The appointed county commissioners were J. M. Ketcham, W. W. McKay and J. F. Murray; with B. W. Knott as the county clerk.
Martin originally proclaimed Bird City as the county seat, as an initial temporary arrangement.
An election for the county seat and for elected county and township officers was held in May 1886, and Wano was chosen as county seat. However, that first election was tainted by voter fraud and later voided by a judge. The current county seat of St. Francis was eventually chosen by an election in February 1889 and later approved by act of the state legislature on in February 1891.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.1%) is water.

=== Farming and biota ===
In 1886, of the county was fenced farms and unfenced farmland, comprising 12% of the county.
There were of cultivated land, being devoted to corn, then the most lucrative crop, followed by to sorghum, its second most lucrative, and of enclosed prairie land.
However, most farmers were livestock farmers.

By 1910, the leading crops were (in descending order of value) wheat, corn, barley, hay, and broomcorn.
There was not originally much native timberland in the county.

=== Geology and hydrology ===
The county is crossed by the Republican River, whose tributaries include Bluff Creek, Cherry Creek, Plum Creek, and Hackberry Creek.
Other trivers include Little Beaver Creek and a reach of Big Beaver Creek in the south-east corner of the county, and the Arickaree River in the north-west corner.

The soil is mainly sandy, with limited amounts of limestone in some of the streams.

===Adjacent counties===
* Dundy County, Nebraska (north/Mountain Time border)
* Rawlins County (east)
* Sherman County (south/Mountain Time border)
* Kit Carson County, Colorado (southwest/Mountain Time border)
* Yuma County, Colorado (west/Mountain Time border)

===Major highways===

* Kansas Highway 27
* Kansas Highway 161

===Time Zones===

The county is in the Central Time zone, but is bordered by the Mountain Time Zone in three directions; it is the only county in the United States to have this characteristic. Dundy County, Nebraska to the north, Yuma County, Colorado and Kit Carson County, Colorado to the west, and Sherman County to the south are all located in the Mountain Time Zone. As a result, Rawlins County is Cheyenne County&#x27;s only neighbor to also observe Central Time.

Cheyenne County is a Republican stronghold. Only four Republican presidential candidates from 1888 to the present day have failed to carry the county, the most recent of which ironically being Kansas Governor Alf Landon in 1936 as he also failed to win the state&#x27;s electoral votes.
===Laws===

==Communities==

List of townships / incorporated cities / unincorporated communities / extinct former communities within Cheyenne County.

===Cities===
* Bird City
* St. Francis (county seat)

===Unincorporated communities===
* Wheeler

===Ghost towns===

* Marney
===Post offices===
In 1886 there were six post offices in the county: Bird City, Calhoun, Lawnridge, Marney, Orlando, and Wano.
In 1888, four had been added — Clugh, Gurney, Jaqua, and Neville — and Wano had become St Francis.
By 1910 this had shrunk to just four: Bird City, Jaqua, St. Francis, and Wheeler.

===Townships===
Cheyenne County is divided into seven townships. None of the cities within the county are considered &quot;governmentally independent&quot;, and all figures for the township include those of the cities. In the following table, the population center is the largest city (or cities) included in that township&#x27;s population total, if it is of a significant size.

Cheyenne started off in 1883 as a single municipal township attached to Rawlins County for judicial and financial purposes.
In the May 1886 election before any county or townships officers had been elected and the county seat had been chosen, there were intended to be three townships: Bird City, Wano, and a township named Hour-glass, dividing up what had by then become three municipal townships although swapping some parts of the municipal townships around for the proposed new townships.

In the end, the county initially had 13 townships: Beaver, Benkelman, Bird City, Calhoun, Cherry Creek, Cleveland Run, Dent, Eureka, Jaqua, Lawn Ridge, Nuttycombe, Orlando, and Wano.
At the start of the 20th century, there were 17 townships: the aforementioned 13 plus Alexander, Evergreen, Jefferson, and Porter, all added some time between 1888 and 1890.
There since has been some consolidation in the 1970s.

<text>Cherokee County is a U.S. county located in Southeast Kansas. Its county seat is Columbus, and its most populous city is Baxter Springs. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 19,362. The county was named for the Cherokee tribe.

==History==
===19th century===
In 1803, United States acquired from France the 828,000-square mile Louisiana Purchase, the former French lands west of the Mississippi River, for 2.83 cents per acre. This territory included most of the land for modern-day Kansas.

In the 1830s, the United States conducted Indian Removal of the Five Civilized Tribes from the Southeast region, to extinguish their land claims and allow European-American settlement in the area. They were given lands in what was called Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River, mostly in present-day Oklahoma. This part of Kansas was included at the time in the Cherokee Neutral Lands, and the county was named after this tribe.

In 1854, the U.S. organized the Kansas Territory. Settlers began to move into the territory, with violence breaking out between supporters of slavery and those who wanted to abolish it. In 1861, Kansas was admitted as the 34th U.S. state; its constitution prohibited slavery. In 1860, Cherokee County was established.

<text>Chautauqua County is a county located in Southeast Kansas, United States. Its county seat and most populous city is Sedan. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 3,379. The county is named for Chautauqua County, New York, the birthplace of Edward Jaquins, a Kansas politician who was instrumental in getting the county established.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. The name is non-native, but is derived from the now-extinct Native Erie language, spoken near the Great Lakes. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. Chautauqua County was created by an act of the Kansas legislature on June 1, 1875, by the division of Howard County into Elk County (the northern half) and Chautauqua County (the southern half). At the time of its creation, the county&#x27;s population was about 7,400.

==Government==

===Presidential elections===
Chautauqua is an overwhelmingly Republican county. The only Republican to ever lose the county has been Herbert Hoover during his landslide 1932 election defeat when he carried fewer than fifty counties west of the Mississippi. Apart from never-Democratic, historically Yankee Doniphan County, it was the only Kansas county to give incumbent President William Howard Taft a plurality in 1912. The last Democrat to pass thirty percent of the county&#x27;s vote was Michael Dukakis in 1988, and in 2020 Joe Biden received merely less than thirteen percent.

===Laws===
Although the Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 to allow the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with the approval of voters, Chautauqua County remained a prohibition, or &quot;dry&quot;, county, until 2008, when a county wide ballot measure was approved to allow individual liquor sales with a 30 percent food requirement.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.

In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Mexico brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.

===19th century===
In 1806, Zebulon Pike led the Pike Expedition westward from St Louis, Missouri, of which part of their journey followed the Cottonwood River through modern Chase County.

In 1859, Chase County was established within the Kansas Territory.

In 1871, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway extended a main line from Emporia to Newton. In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (3 miles west of Strong City) to Superior, Nebraska. This branch line connected Strong City, Neva, Rockland, Diamond Springs, Burdick, Lost Springs, Jacobs, Hope, Navarre, Enterprise, Abilene, Talmage, Manchester, Longford, Oak Hill, Miltonvale, Aurora, Huscher, Concordia, Kackley, Courtland, Webber, Superior. At some time, the line from Neva to Lost Springs was pulled but the right of way has not been abandoned. This branch line was originally called &quot;Strong City and Superior line&quot; but later the name was shortened to the &quot;Strong City line&quot;. In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway.

The south-western border one mile &quot;notch&quot; into Marion County was established under unusual circumstances. A murder had occurred and Marion County didn&#x27;t want to have the trial, so a section one mile wide and eighteen miles long was permanently ceded to Chase County to ensure the murder had occurred there.

===20th century===
In 1931, Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne died in a plane crash a few miles southwest of Bazaar, in Chase County, Kansas.

In 1991, the county was the subject of the book: PrairyErth: (A Deep Map).

In 1996, the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve was established in the county.

The center of population of Kansas is located in Cottonwood Falls, Kansas, about four miles north of Strong City.

<text>Butler County is a county in the U.S. state of Kansas and is the largest county in the state by total area. Its county seat is El Dorado and its most populous city is Andover. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 67,380. The county was named for Andrew Butler, a U.S. Senator from South Carolina who coauthored the Kansas–Nebraska Act.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.

In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.

===19th century===
In 1855, Butler County was founded. It was named in honor of a U.S. Senator from South Carolina, Andrew Butler (1796-1857), who was one of the authors of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 and a strong advocate of Kansas becoming a slave state.

In 1877, the Florence, El Dorado, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company built a branch line from Florence to El Dorado, in 1881 it was extended to Douglass, and later to Arkansas City. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to El Dorado was abandoned in 1942. The original branch line connected Florence, Burns, De Graff, El Dorado, Augusta, Douglass, Rock, Akron, Winfield, Arkansas City.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a branch line north–south from Herington to Caldwell. This branch line connected Herington, Lost Springs, Lincolnville, Antelope, Marion, Aulne, Peabody, Elbing, Whitewater, Furley, Kechi, Wichita, Peck, Corbin, Wellington, Caldwell. By 1893, this branch line was incrementally built to Fort Worth, Texas. This line is called the &quot;OKT&quot;. The Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway was foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, and finally merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2010, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was constructed north to south through Butler County (near Potwin, Towanda, Augusta, Douglass), with much controversy over tax exemption and environmental concerns (if a leak ever occurs). A pumping station named &quot;Burns&quot; was built 2 miles north of Potwin, and new power lines were built from a high-voltage line 0.3 mile east of De Graff.

In an unusual technical glitch, a farmstead about 4 miles northeast of Potwin became the default site of 600 million IP addresses (due to their lack of fine granularity) when the Massachusetts-based digital mapping company MaxMind changed the putative geographic center of the contiguous United States from 39.8333333,-98.585522 to 38.0000,-97.0000.

In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. Brown County was founded in 1855, was named for Albert G. Brown.

==Government==

===Presidential elections===
Like all of Kansas outside the eastern cities, Brown County is overwhelmingly Republican, although its history of Yankee settlement means it has been thus for longer than certain other parts of the state. Brown was Alf Landon’s strongest county in his home state during his disastrous 1936 presidential campaign. FDR was never to win so much as 42 percent of the vote in any of his four Presidential elections; indeed no Democratic presidential nominee has ever won a majority in Brown County, with the highest percentage being 47 percent by William Jennings Bryan in 1896. A mortally divided Republican Party allowed Woodrow Wilson to win a plurality in 1912 with under 37 percent of the county’s vote – nonetheless since 1968 no Democrat has reached even that percentage.

===Laws===
Following amendment to the Kansas Constitution in 1986, the county remained a prohibition, or &quot;dry&quot;, county until 2000, when voters approved the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink without a food sales requirement.

<text>Bourbon County is a county located in Southeast Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Fort Scott. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 14,360. The county was named after Bourbon County, Kentucky, the former home of many early settlers.

==History==

===Early history===

In 1855, Bourbon County was established and named after Bourbon County, Kentucky, due to the significant number of settlers from that region. Its early history is tied to the establishment of Fort Scott in 1842 to manage relations with Indian tribes in the region, and particularly with the Osage. The county&#x27;s first settlers, many of whom were pro-slavery, faced opposition from free-state advocates, leading to violent confrontations during the Bleeding Kansas era and later during the Civil War, such the Battle of Mine Creek in 1864.

The aftermath of the Civil War brought economic and demographic changes; many ex-soldiers settled in the area, contributing to its agricultural growth. Post-war years saw the railroad&#x27;s arrival, connecting Bourbon County to broader markets and facilitating the expansion of coal mining and agriculture, particularly wheat, corn, and later, sorghum.

===21st century===
Bourbon virus, a new strain of thogotovirus, was first discovered in Bourbon County. In the spring of 2014 an otherwise healthy man was bitten by a tick, contracting the virus, dying 11 days later from organ failure.

<text>Barton County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Great Bend. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 25,493. The county is named in honor of Clara Barton, responsible for the founding of the American Red Cross, and the only county in Kansas to be named for a woman.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===

In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, Barton County was established and named for Clara Barton. It is the only Kansas county named for a woman.

In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion and McPherson counties chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson; in 1880 it was extended to Lyons and in 1881 was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase and Ellinwood.

===21st century===
In 2001, an F4 tornado hit Hoisington during Hoisington High School&#x27;s prom.

<text>Barber County is a county located in the south-central portion of the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Medicine Lodge. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 4,228. The county was named for Thomas Barber, an abolitionist who was killed in Douglas County in 1855 during the Wakarusa War.

==History==
Barber County was formed in 1867 from parts of Washington County, Peketon County, and Marion County. Organized in 1873, it was named after Thomas Barber, a free-state man killed during Bleeding Kansas. The county&#x27;s name was initially misspelled as “Barbour” before being officially changed to “Barber.”

The land that would become Barber County was formerly part of the &quot;thirty mile&quot; and &quot;three mile&quot; strips, previously owned by the Osages and the Cherokees respectively. These lands were ceded to the United States Government by the treaty of July 15, 1870, and were then offered for pre-emption, but not for homesteading or timber claim entry. Early settlers noted the numerous buffalo wallows in the county.

The first settler in the county, a man named Griffin, settled in the winter of 1871-72 near Sun City. Indians opposed to white settlement soon brought conflict, including an 1872 raid resulting in the death of trader E. H. Mosely. Defensive stockades were subsequently erected in Medicine Lodge and Sun City.

Settlements such as Kiowa and Medicine Lodge were established, with rapid settlement occurring in the summer of 1873. Notable events included the county&#x27;s first child born in 1873 and its first wedding in 1874.

In the summer of 1874, an Indian raid resulted in the murder of several settlers along the Medicine Lodge River. Various accounts attribute the raid to Indian opposition to white settlement or the actions of disguised white assailants aiming to cover up their illegal activities in the county. To protect citizens, stockades were built, and militia groups were organized in Medicine Lodge and Sun City.

Buffalo once roamed abundantly in the county, but by the 1880s, their numbers had significantly diminished. Their former habitat, however, made excellent range for cattle, and in 1870, Barber and Comanche county ranchers formed a cooperative known as the Comanche cattle pool. The discovery of gypsum deposits along the Medicine Lodge River led to the establishment of a plaster company in Sun City in 1891.

The Medicine Lodge Bank was robbed in 1884 by a gang led by Henry Newton Brown, the marshal of Caldwell in nearby Sumner County. The bandits were pursued, captured, and thrown in jail. That night, a mob overpowered the Medicine Lodge sheriff, shot and killed Brown, and hanged the other men from a tree.

Temperance advocate Carrie Nation smashed her first saloon in Kiowa, Kansas in 1900. Today, her former residence is a National Historic Landmark.

<text>Atchison County is a county located in the northeastern portion of the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Atchison. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 16,348. The county was named in honor of David Atchison, a U.S. Senator from Missouri and border ruffian during the &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; era.

==History==

Atchison County was established in 1855, named for David Rice Atchison, a U.S. Senator from Missouri known for his pro-slavery views, which reflected the county&#x27;s early political leanings during the Kansas Territory&#x27;s tumultuous &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; period. The area was first explored by European traders and later by the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1804, who celebrated the first Independence Day in the area. The first settlers, largely from Missouri, arrived in 1854, founding the town of Atchison that same year, which quickly became a hub due to its strategic location on the Missouri River, facilitating trade and transportation.

The Civil War era saw Atchison County as a center of pro-slavery sentiment, yet it also contributed soldiers to both sides of the conflict, reflecting the divided loyalties of the time. The county&#x27;s economy was significantly shaped by its river port facilities, which were vital for the steamboat trade and later for railroad development. By 1860, the Atchison and Topeka Railroad was chartered, and by 1870, Atchison was a major railroad hub, with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (Santa Fe) starting from there in 1868. This infrastructure, combined with Kansas Statehood in 1861 and the end of the Civil War in 1865, boosted the local economy and made Atchison a key point for westward expansion.

Moving into the late 19th century, Atchison County faced challenges like economic downturns and natural disasters, including floods, but it continued to grow as an industrial and agricultural center. The county became known for its flour milling, due to its proximity to wheat fields, and its manufacturing industries, particularly after the Civil War, when life normalized, and new enterprises sprang up.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water. It is the fourth-smallest county by area in Kansas.

On July 4, 1804, to mark Independence Day, the Lewis and Clark Expedition named Independence Creek (River) located near the city of Atchison (see Timeline of the Lewis and Clark Expedition).

<text>Anderson County is a county located in East Central Kansas, in the Central United States. Its county seat and most populous city is Garnett. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 7,836. The county was named for Joseph C. Anderson, a Kansas territorial legislator and border ruffian during the &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; era.

==History==

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, and in 1855, Anderson County was established as one of the original 33 counties of the Kansas Territory, named for territorial legislator Joseph C. Anderson. The initial settlement began in 1854 with individuals like Valentine Gerth and Francis Meyer staking claims near what would become Greeley. The settlers discovered fields previously worked by the Potawatomi, who had been relocated there in 1833. The early years were fraught with conflict during &quot;Bleeding Kansas,&quot; with Anderson County men engaging in battles like the one at Osawatomie, where the clash over slavery was intense.

The county&#x27;s administrative center was initially established at Shannon, but disputes over the location of the county seat resulted in its move to Garnett in 1859, where it has remained. The agrarian economy suffered from natural disasters, including the severe drought of 1860, which left the county in distress. Subsequent years brought the infamous grasshopper plagues of 1874-1875, which devastated crops, yet the resolve of the settlers saw them through these hardships. The introduction of wheat farming helped stabilize the region.

In 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. The Civil War period saw Anderson County&#x27;s men volunteer for Union forces, with the war also temporarily halting the cattle drives from Texas that had introduced Spanish fever to the local cattle. Post-war, the county experienced a resurgence in agricultural development, with the arrival of the railroad playing a crucial role in economic growth by opening up markets. As Anderson County moved towards the 20th century, its economy was based on farming, with some coal mining activities due to local deposits. The onset of World War I saw the community rallying to support the war effort, with many local men enlisting for service overseas. This era marked the beginning of a transition period, where traditional farming practices would soon give way to technological advancements in agriculture.

In 1884, the first photograph of a tornado was taken in Anderson county.

<text>Allen County is a county located in the southeast portion of the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Iola. As of the 2020 census, the population was 12,526. The county was named for William Allen, a U.S. Senator from Ohio and prominent supporter of westward expansion.

==History==
===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized. Allen County is one of the 33 counties established by the first territorial legislature in August 1855, six years before Kansas statehood in 1861. It was named in honor of William Allen, a United States senator from Ohio. At the time of its creation, Charles Passmore was appointed probate judge; B.W. Cowden and Barnett Owen were appointed county commissioners, and William Godfrey was appointed sheriff. The appointments were temporary until the general election in 1857. The four men were authorized to appoint the county clerk and treasurer thus completing the county organization.

Richard J. Fuqua and his family are considered the first white settlers in the county, arriving in the valley of the Neosho River January 1855. Fuqua established a post for trading with the neighboring Indian tribes which became quite popular with the Sac and Fox Indians. B.W. Cowden and H.D. Parsons arrived in March of the same year and selected claims in the valley of the Neosho River, near the mouth of Elm Creek. The next settlement was made near the mouth of Deer Creek (so named for the abundance of deer in the area) by Major James Parsons, and his two sons, Jesse and James, and a Mr. Duncan. The population grew rapidly through the spring and summer of 1855, most of it located on or near the Neosho River.

Many of the early settlers were pro-slavery, but few slaves were actually brought into the county. The anti-slavery population expressed such antipathy toward their pro-slavery neighbors that slaves within the county there were either freed or taken elsewhere in Kansas by their masters. Immigration continued during the summer and fall of 1856, though in reduced numbers.

The first town and county seat was Cofachique. In the spring of 1855 pro-slavery settlers from Fort Scott laid out the town in a hilly area east of the Neosho River and south of the mouth of Elm Creek. The territorial legislature passed an act in July 1855 incorporating the Cofachique Town Association. It was the only town in Allen County for nearly two years and as such was quite successful; but in 1857 other towns were constructed and Cofachique began to decline almost immediately. One of the reasons for decline was accessibility, the other was a lack of good well water. Another possible contribution to the town&#x27;s decline involved tensions between the pro and anti-slavery settlers. With the development of neighboring towns Humboldt and Iola the town of Cofachique all but disappeared by 1859. The county seat went briefly to Humboldt in 1857 where it remained until 1865, but with the election of that year Iola took the county seat and has retained this designation to the present.

After a series of disputes between residents in the county over where a county jail should be located, Allen County&#x27;s first jail was constructed in Iola in 1869 at a cost of $8,400. It operated until a replacement jail house was opened in 1959. Since that time the original jail has been run as a museum.

The last year of the territorial period (1860) was one of the most difficult years since the initial settlement of the county. Periods of drought beginning as early as 1854 had plagued all of Kansas and though 1859 had seen a reprieve, by the end of 1859 and into 1860 the drought worsened. The St. Laurence newspaper reported: &quot;No rain, no snow, and much open, thawing, mild weather, alternated with sharp, though brief [cold] snaps...&quot; Most of the people who had moved to the county in the previous two years were still trying to establish their farms. With the prospect of starvation and hardship before them, many decided to return to the east.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water. Allen County is located in the southeastern part of the state, in the second tier of counties west of Missouri, and about fifty miles north of Oklahoma. In extent it is twenty-one miles from north to south and twenty-four miles from east to west.

===Geographic features===
The general surface of the country is slightly rolling, though much more level than the greater portion of eastern Kansas. The soil is fertile and highly productive. The bottom lands along the streams average one and one-half miles in width, and comprise one-tenth the area of the county. The remainder is the gently rolling or level upland prairie. The principal varieties of trees native to the county are black walnut, hickory, cottonwood, oak, hackberry and elm.

The main water course is the Neosho River, which flows through the western part of the county from north to south. Its tributaries are Indian, Martin&#x27;s, Deer, Elm, Vegetarian Creek, and other small creeks. The Marmaton River rises east of the center of the county, and flows through the southeastern part of the county. The Little Osage River rises not far from the head of the Marmaton and flows northeast. Its tributaries are Middle Creek on the north and the South Fork on the south.

In the county, the population was spread out, with 25.20% under the age of 18, 9.80% from 18 to 24, 24.10% from 25 to 44, 22.90% from 45 to 64, and 18.00% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 95.60 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.70 males.

The median income for a household in the county was $31,481, and the median income for a family was $39,117. Males had a median income of $27,305 versus $19,221 for females. The per capita income for the county was $15,640. About 11.30% of families and 14.90% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.20% of those under age 18 and 12.70% of those age 65 or over.

===Historical trends===
During the years of the American Civil War the county continued to develop though at a slower rate. From 1860 to 1870 there was a steady increase in population from 3,082 to 7,022 residents. The next ten years brought a similar steady rise, from 7,022 to 11,303 residents. The county&#x27;s largest growth period was between 1890 and 1910. At its peak in 1910, Allen County had 27,640 residents. Thereafter the county experienced a slow decline in population. By 2010, the population was slightly below the population in 1890 there being 13,371 residents. The population increase during the 1890/1910 period was likely due to the oil and gas discoveries and production near Iola.

==Government==

===Presidential elections===
Allen County is a Republican stronghold. The last Democrat to carry this county was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, although Bill Clinton came within just 39 votes of carrying it in 1992.
===Laws===
Following amendment to the Kansas Constitution in 1986, the county remained a prohibition, or &quot;dry&quot;, county until 2000, when voters approved the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with a 30% food sales requirement.

Outside the county the route connects to Fort Scott in the east and Yates Center and eventually Wichita in the west. Passing through eastern portions of the county and the communities of Mildred and Moran, U.S. Route 59 is one of two north–south routes. It connects to Kincaid and eventually Ottawa and Lawrence in the north and Erie in the south. The other route is U.S. Route 169 which passes through western portions of the county and bypasses to the east of the cities of Iola, Bassett, and Humboldt. It connects to Chanute and eventually Coffeyville in the south. The segment between Iola and Chanute is a freeway with fully controlled access, although there is only one lane in each direction. US-169 provides a direct route for traveling between Kansas City and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

<doc id="95752" wikidata="Q1920404" url="?curid=95752" title="Menehune">
<text>Menehune are a mythological race of dwarf people in Hawaiian tradition who are said to live in the deep forests and hidden valleys of the Hawaiian Islands, hidden and far away from human settlements.

The Menehune are described as superb craftspeople. They built temples (&quot;heiau&quot;), fishponds, roads, canoes, and houses. Some of these structures that Hawaiian folklore attributed to the Menehune still exist. They are said to have lived in Hawaii before settlers arrived from Polynesia many centuries ago. Their favorite food is the &quot;maia&quot; (banana), and they also like fish. Legend has it that the Menehune appear only during the night hours to build masterpieces. But if they fail to complete their work in the length of the night, they will leave it unoccupied. No one but their children and humans connected to them can see the Menehune.

==Theories==
In Martha Warren Beckwith&#x27;s &quot;Hawaiian AKA Ilenes Mythology&quot;, there are references to several other forest dwelling races: the &quot;ilene Irenes&quot;, who were large-sized wild hunters descended from Lua-nuu, the &quot;mu&quot; people, and the &quot;wa&quot; people.

Some early scholars hypothesized that there was a first settlement of Hawaii, by settlers from the Marquesas Islands, and a second, from Tahiti. The Tahitian settlers oppressed the &quot;commoners&quot;, the &quot;manahune&quot; in the Tahitian language, who fled to the mountains and were called Menahune. Proponents of this hypothesis point to an 1820 census of Kauai by Kaumualii, the ruling &quot;alii aimoku&quot; of the island, which listed 65 people as &quot;menehune&quot;.

Folklorist Katharine Luomala believes that the legends of the &quot;Menehune&quot; are a post-European contact mythology created by adaptation of the term &quot;manahune&quot; (which by the time of the colonization of the Hawaiian Islands by Europeans had acquired a meaning of &quot;lowly people&quot; or &quot;low social status&quot; and not diminutive in stature) to European legends of brownies. It is claimed that &quot;Menehune&quot; are not mentioned in pre-contact mythology, but that is unproven since it was an oral mythology; the legendary &quot;overnight&quot; creation of the Alekoko fishpond, for example, finds its equivalent in the legend about the creation of a corresponding structure on Oahu, which was supposedly indeed completed in a single day not by &quot;menehune&quot; but as a show of power by a local &quot;alii&quot;, who commanded all of his subjects to appear at the construction site and to assist in building.

==Structures attributed to the Menehune==
* Menehune Fishpond wall at Niumalu, Kauai
* Kīkīaola ditch at Waimea, Kauai
* Necker Island structures
* &quot;Pa o ka menehune&quot;, breakwater at Kahaluu Bay.
* Ulupo Heiau at Kailua, Oahu

==Other uses==

* In the experimental 1970s&#x27; ALOHAnet developed at the University of Hawaii, the packet controllers were called Menehune, a pun on the equivalent &quot;IMP&quot; (Interface Message Processor) in the early ARPANET. The modern Ethernet was based on the carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) methodology pioneered by ALOHA.
* The Menehune is the school mascot of Waimea High School on Kaua&#x27;i and Makakilo Elementary School, Maunawili Elementary School, Moanalua High School, and Mililani Waena Elementary School on Oahu.
* United Airlines used the Menehune in brand advertising for their service to Hawaii in the 1970s through the 1980s. The figurines and travel agency displays are now collectors&#x27; items.
* Carl Barks wrote a story featuring Scrooge McDuck helped by Menehunes, &quot;The Menehune Mystery&quot;.
* The Menehune play a key role in the &quot;Rocket Power&quot; TV movie, &quot;Island of the Menehune&quot;.
* The Menehune are key figures in the children’s story, &quot;My Sister Sif&quot;, written by acclaimed Australian author, Ruth Park.
* The &quot;Forerunner Saga&quot;, set in the &quot;Halo&quot; universe, identifies Menehune as members of the human subspecies &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; settled on Hawaii following activation of the Halo Array 100,000 years ago.

<text>In Tongan mythology, or oral history, Ahoeitu is a son of the god Eitumātupua and a mortal woman, Ilaheva Vaepopua. He became the first king of the Tui Tonga (&quot;Tonga king&quot;) dynasty in the early 10th century, dethroning the previous one with the same name but originating from the uanga (&quot;maggots&quot;) instead of divine; see Kohai, Koau, mo Momo.

== Trip to the sky ==
When Ahoeitu was growing up, his ceaseless curiosity about his paternal heritage was repudiated by his mother, with his habitual inquiries gradually wearing down her resolve. His mother, Ilaheva Va&#x27;epopua, was an earthly woman living in what is now Popua (called after her name), a suburb of the capital city, Nuku&#x27;alofa, and located near the large lagoon of Tongatapu. She was once the mistress of the sky-god, Tangaloa &#x27;Eitumatupu&#x27;a, enjoying his affections and cohabitating with him when he visited the earth, an affair that led to the conception of &#x27;Aho&#x27;eitu, prompting the sky-god to leave before his son was born. After years of constant queries, Ahoeitu&#x27;s mother finally revealed to him the identity of his father. She directed him to the great &quot;toa&quot; tree, which the lad scaled, landing in his father&#x27;s realm. He followed the path to which his mother had directed him, and found his father catching doves. Eitumātupua was moved to see his son, and invited him to his house for kava and food.

== Sibling treachery and murder ==
Afterwards, the god introduced him to his other sons, Ahoeitu&#x27;s older half-brothers, who were the sons of celestial women. These other sons, who were also living in the sky, were at that moment playing &quot;sika-ulu-toa&quot;, a volley-throwing game with javelins made from the wood of the &quot;toa&quot; (ironwood) tree. When his brothers were introduced to their half-blooded sibling, they grew extremely envious of him. Once they were left alone with &#x27;Aho&#x27;eitu, they challenged their brother to join in the game, during which the boy was mortally wounded by one of his brothers&#x27; well-aimed javelins. The boy died, and his remains were cooked (some sources say they were not) and cannibalised by his gleeful siblings, who tossed his head into a &quot;hoi&quot; bush, making it poisonous ever since.

== Resurrection ==
Some time afterwards, Eitumātupua sent a woman to fetch Ahoeitu, but she returned with the message that the boy was not to be found. The god immediately deduced what had happened and confronted his other sons, forcing them to vomit their brother&#x27;s remains into a (a large wooden bowl, now widely used throughout the South Pacific islands for kava-drinking ceremonies) by tickling their throats. Noticing that the boy&#x27;s head was missing, Eitumātupua sent a messenger to seek out the head and the bones. When the last of &#x27;Aho&#x27;eitu&#x27;s missing remains were located, everything was combined in the , together with water and some leaves from the &quot;nonufiafia&quot;, which is a known medicinal plant able to revive people who were near death. The contents were then stirred and the bowl covered with banana leaves, and then the process repeated a second and third time, when Ahoeitu suddenly sat up, body reconstituted and very much alive.

== Resolution ==
He and his brothers were then summoned into Eitumātupua&#x27;s presence, where the god rebuked his elder sons for their treachery. He punished them by confining them to the sky, while Ahoeitu was sent back to the earth, with divine mandate to become the King of Tonga. The wicked half-brothers repented, and begged their father that they also be allowed to follow Ahoeitu onto the earth. Their father eventually relented, but stipulated that regardless of their divinity and seniority in age, they and their descendents were to serve Ahoeitu and his house forever.

== Royal lineage ==
From &#x27;Aho&#x27;eitu, the Tu&#x27;i Tonga Dynasty that once reigned over Tonga and its historical territories is descended. Although the Tu&#x27;i Tonga title itself now lies defunct, the succession continues through the noble title of Kalaniuvalu as of 1865, when the last Tu&#x27;i Tonga, His Majesty Sanualio Laufilitonga, died, leaving his son, the Lord Kalaniuvalu (&quot;né&quot; Viliami Fatafehi-&#x27;o-Lapaha), as the successor to a disgraced legacy. The current sovereign of Tonga, HM Tupou VI, is directly descended from Laufilitonga through the latter&#x27;s daughter, the Lady Lavinia Veiongo, who was Kalaniuvalu&#x27;s twin sister, which accords the Tupou Dynasty with customary seniority over Kalaniuvalu and his descendants courtesy of the old Fahu System of Tongan kinship. Apart from this, the House of Tupou are also directly descended from &#x27;Aho&#x27;eitu as the rightful successors of the Tu&#x27;i Kanokupolu lineage, which was a junior branch of the royal bloodline tasked with governing the rebellious Hihifo district of Tongatapu. In this regard, it can be reasoned that the Tu&#x27;i Tonga dynasty and its kingship are still extant, making it the second oldest surviving royal dynasty after the imperial dynasty of Japan.

&#x27;Aho&#x27;eitu&#x27;s older brothers were:
* Talafale: he became the Tui Faleua (&quot;King [of the] Second House&quot;), a spare dynasty in case Ahoeitu&#x27;s line would ever die out (which apparently has still not happened). He also became the Tui Pelehake (&quot;Favoured Ruler&quot;), another very high title. For years, Prince Fatafehi, brother to King Taufa&#x27;ahau Tupou IV, kept both titles, but after his death in 1999, only the Tui Pelehake title was inherited by his son, as the Tui Faleua title reverted to the Crown.
* Matakehe: his line became extinct during the reign of the Tui Tonga, Tuʻitātui. He, and his younger brother, the Tui Folaha, were the guardians of the Tui Tonga&#x27;s person.
* Māliepō; his descendants are the matāpule, Lauaki, and the Kau Tufunga (Royal Undertakers).
* Tui Loloko: his line is still extant. He and his younger brother were to govern in the name of the king.
* Tui Folaha; his lineage came to end during the reign of the Tui Tonga, Tuʻitātui. Along with his brother, Matakehe, they were the guardians of the Tui Tonga&#x27;s person, with the title ultimately having a bloodline directly connected to Houma, a village in the south-west of Tongatapu.

ʻAhoʻeitu has become the namesake for several other generations of his chiefly and royal descendants. The current king, Tupou VI, for instance, was baptised as Prince ʻAhoʻeitu ʻUnuakiʻotonga Tukuʻaho.

<text>Exokernel is an operating system kernel developed by the MIT Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems group, and also a class of similar operating systems.

Operating systems generally present hardware resources to applications through high-level abstractions such as (virtual) file systems. The idea behind exokernels is to force as few abstractions as possible on application developers, enabling them to make as many decisions as possible about hardware abstractions. Exokernels are tiny, since functionality is limited to ensuring protection and multiplexing of resources, which is considerably simpler than conventional microkernels&#x27; implementation of message passing and monolithic kernels&#x27; implementation of high-level abstractions.

Implemented abstractions are called library operating systems; they may request specific memory addresses, disk blocks, etc. The kernel only ensures that the requested resource is free, and the application is allowed to access it. This low-level hardware access allows the programmer to implement custom abstractions, and omit unnecessary ones, most commonly to improve a program&#x27;s performance. It also allows programmers to choose what level of abstraction they want, high, or low.

Exokernels can be seen as an application of the end-to-end principle to operating systems, in that they do not force an application program to layer its abstractions on top of other abstractions that were designed with different requirements in mind. For example, in the MIT Exokernel project, the Cheetah web server stores preformatted Internet Protocol packets on the disk, the kernel provides safe access to the disk by preventing unauthorized reading and writing, but how the disk is abstracted is up to the application or the libraries the application uses.

==Motivation==
Traditionally, kernel designers have sought to make individual hardware resources invisible to application programs by requiring the programs to interact with the hardware via some abstraction model. These models include file systems for disk storage, virtual address spaces for memory, schedulers for task management, and sockets for network communication. These abstractions of the hardware make it easier to write programs in general, but limit performance and stifle experimentation in new abstractions. A security-oriented application might need a file system that does not leave old data on the disk, while a reliability-oriented application might need a file system that keeps such data for failure recovery.

One option is to remove the kernel completely and program directly to the hardware, but then the entire machine would be dedicated to the application being written (and, conversely, the entire application codebase would be dedicated to that machine). The exokernel concept is a compromise: let the kernel allocate the basic physical resources of the machine (e.g. disk blocks, memory pages, and processor time) to multiple application programs, and let each program decide what to do with these resources. The program can then link to a support library that implements the abstractions it needs (or it can implement its own).

==MIT exokernels==
MIT developed two exokernel-based operating systems, using two kernels: Aegis, a proof of concept with limited support for storage, and XOK, which applied the exokernel concept more thoroughly.

An essential idea of the MIT exokernel system is that the operating system should act as an executive for small programs provided by the application software, which are constrained only by the requirement that the exokernel must be able to guarantee that they use the hardware safely.

The MIT exokernel manages hardware resources as follows:

; Processor
: The kernel represents the processor resources as a timeline from which programs can allocate intervals of time. A program can yield the rest of its time slice to another designated program. The kernel notifies programs of processor events, such as interrupts, hardware exceptions, and the beginning or end of a time slice. If a program takes a long time to handle an event, the kernel will penalize it on subsequent time slice allocations; in extreme cases the kernel can abort the program.

; Memory
: The kernel allocates physical memory pages to programs and controls the translation lookaside buffer. A program can share a page with another program by sending it a &quot;capability&quot; to access that page. The kernel ensures that programs access only pages for which they have a capability.

; Disk storage
: The kernel identifies disk blocks to the application program by their physical block address, allowing the application to optimize data placement. When the program initializes its use of the disk, it provides the kernel with a function that the kernel can use to determine which blocks the program controls. The kernel uses this callback to verify that when it allocates a new block, the program claims only the block that was allocated in addition to those it already controlled.

; Networking
: The kernel implements a programmable packet filter, which executes programs in a bytecode language designed for easy security-checking by the kernel.

===Applications===
The available library operating systems for Exokernel include the custom ExOS system and an emulator for BSD. In addition to these, the exokernel team created the Cheetah web server, which uses the kernel directly.

==History==

The exokernel concept has been around since at least 1994, but exokernels are still a research effort and have not been used in any major commercial operating systems.

A concept operating exokernel system is Nemesis, written by University of Cambridge, University of Glasgow, Citrix Systems, and the Swedish Institute of Computer Science. MIT has also built several exokernel-based systems, including ExOS.

<text>Atua are the gods and spirits of the Polynesian people such as the Māori or the Hawaiians (see also ). The literal meaning of the Polynesian word is &quot;power&quot; or &quot;strength&quot; and so the concept is similar to that of &quot;mana&quot;. Many of the atua that are known have originated from myths and legends of each Polynesian culture before Christianity was introduced. These days, the word atua is related to the monotheistic conception of God. However for Polynesian cultures, as opposed to having only one superior god, there are multiple atua. 

For Māori, there are eight main atua - excluding the parents, Ranginui (sky father) and Papatūānuku (earth mother): 
* &quot;Tāne Mahuta&quot; – god of the forest and all forest creatures such as animals, birds and trees;
* Tāwhirimātea - god of wind and storms; 
* Haumia-tiketike - god of uncultivated food and fernroot (also known as Haumia, Haumia-tikitiki, and Haumia-roa);
* &quot;Rongo-mā-Tāne&quot; – god of Agriculture and Peace (also known as Rongohīrea and Rongomaraeroa);
* &quot;Tangaroa&quot; – god of the sea;
* &quot;Tūmatauenga&quot; – god of war and humans (also known as Tūkāriri); 
* Rūaumoko - god of earthquakes (also known as Rūaimoko);
* &quot;Whiro-te-tipua&quot; – god of darkness, evil, and death.

In the Samoan language, where atua means &quot;god&quot;, traditional tattooing was based on the doctrine of tutelary spirits. There is also a district on the island of Upolu in Samoa called Atua. 
Atua or gods are also at the centre of Māori mythology. In traditional Māori belief, there is no specific word for &quot;religion&quot; because the natural and supernatural world are seen as one.

In other Austronesian cultures, cognates of &quot;atua&quot; include the Polynesian &quot;aitu&quot;, Micronesian &quot;aniti&quot;, Bunun , Filipino and Tao &quot;anito&quot;, and Malaysian and Indonesian &quot;hantu&quot; or &quot;antu&quot;.

In popular culture, Atua is the name that is used to refer to the deity which the character Angie Yonaga worships in the English dub of &quot;Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony.&quot; The term &quot;Atua&quot; is often associated with her character.

Similar to Māori, there are many Samoan mythologies with deities (&quot;atua&quot;). In Samoa, there two types of atua: atua (non-human origins) and aitu (human origins). In Samoa, the atua known as Tagaloa was regarded as the creator of all beings.[6] The atua known as Savea was recognized as being the ruler over Pulotu, the underworld of spirits. He is a complex figure in Samoan mythology and represents death and life.[7] Mafui&#x27;e was known as the god of earthquakes.[8] However, since Christianity was introduced to Samoa in 1830[9] , the existence and belief of these deities were soon forgotten by the Samoan people, leaving only their myths and stories.

<text>In Polynesian languages the word aitu refers to ghosts or spirits, often malevolent. The word is common to many languages of Western and Eastern Polynesia. In the mythology of Tonga, for example, &quot;aitu&quot; or &quot;eitu&quot; are lesser gods, many being patrons of specific villages and families. They often take the form of plants or animals, and are often more cruel than other gods. These trouble-making gods are regarded as having come from Samoa. The Tongan word &quot;tangi lauaitu&quot; means to cry from grief, to lament.

In Māori mythology, the word &quot;aitu&quot; refers to sickness, calamity, or demons; the related word &quot;aituā&quot; means misfortune, accident, disaster. In Tahitian, &quot;aitu&quot; (syn. atua/raitu) can mean &#x27;god&#x27; or &#x27;spirit&#x27;; in other languages, including Rarotongan, Samoan, Sikaiana, Kapingamarangi, Takuu, Tuamotuan, and Niuean, &quot;aitu&quot; are ghosts or spirits.

In Cook Islands &quot;Aitu&quot; is also the name of ancient tribes who came from the east.

In the Samoa Islands, &quot;aitu&quot; also means ghost. In other Austronesian cultures, cognates of &quot;aitu&quot; include the Micronesian &quot;aniti&quot;, Bunun &quot;hanitu&quot;, Filipino and Tao &quot;anito&quot;, and Malaysian and Indonesian &quot;hantu&quot; or &quot;antu&quot;.

<text>L4 is a family of second-generation microkernels, used to implement a variety of types of operating systems (OS), though mostly for Unix-like, &quot;Portable Operating System Interface&quot; (POSIX) compliant types.

L4, like its predecessor microkernel L3, was created by German computer scientist Jochen Liedtke as a response to the poor performance of earlier microkernel-based OSes. Liedtke felt that a system designed from the start for high performance, rather than other goals, could produce a microkernel of practical use. His original implementation in hand-coded Intel i386-specific assembly language code in 1993 created attention by being 20 times faster than Mach.
The follow-up publication two years later was considered so influential that it won the 2015 ACM SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award.
Since its introduction, L4 has been developed to be cross-platform and to improve security, isolation, and robustness.

There have been various re-implementations of the original L4 kernel application binary interface (ABI) and its successors, including &quot;L4Ka::Pistachio&quot; (implemented by Liedtke and his students at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), &quot;L4/MIPS&quot; (University of New South Wales (UNSW)), &quot;Fiasco&quot; (Dresden University of Technology (TU Dresden)). For this reason, the name &quot;L4&quot; has been generalized and no longer refers to only Liedtke&#x27;s original implementation. It now applies to the whole microkernel family including the L4 kernel interface and its different versions.

L4 is widely deployed. One variant, OKL4 from Open Kernel Labs, shipped in billions of mobile devices.

== Design paradigm ==
Specifying the general idea of a microkernel, Liedtke states:

A concept is tolerated inside the microkernel only if moving it outside the kernel, i.e., permitting competing implementations, would prevent the implementation of the system&#x27;s required functionality.

In this spirit, the L4 microkernel provides few basic mechanisms: address spaces (abstracting page tables and providing memory protection), threads and scheduling (abstracting execution and providing temporal protection), and inter-process communication (for controlled communication across isolation boundaries).

An operating system based on a microkernel like L4 provides services as servers in user space that monolithic kernels like Linux or older generation microkernels include internally. For example, to implement a secure Unix-like system, servers must provide the rights management that Mach included inside the kernel.

== History ==
The poor performance of first-generation microkernels, such as Mach, led a number of developers to re-examine the entire microkernel concept in the mid-1990s. The asynchronous in-kernel-buffering process communication concept used in Mach turned out to be one of the main reasons for its poor performance. This induced developers of Mach-based operating systems to move some time-critical components, like file systems or drivers, back inside the kernel. While this somewhat ameliorated the performance issues, it plainly violates the minimality concept of a true microkernel (and squanders their major advantages).

Detailed analysis of the Mach bottleneck indicated that, among other things, its working set is too large: the IPC code expresses poor spatial locality; that is, it results in too many cache misses, of which most are in-kernel. This analysis gave rise to the principle that an efficient microkernel should be small enough that the majority of performance-critical code fits into the (first-level) cache (preferably a small fraction of said cache).

=== L3 ===
Jochen Liedtke set out to prove that a well-designed thinner inter-process communication (IPC) layer, with careful attention to performance and machine-specific (in contrast to cross-platform software) design could yield large real-world performance improvements. Instead of Mach&#x27;s complex IPC system, his L3 microkernel simply passed the message with no added overhead. Defining and implementing the required security policies were considered to be duties of the user space servers. The role of the kernel was only to provide the needed mechanism to enable the user-level servers to enforce the policies. L3, developed in 1988, proved itself a safe and robust operating system, used for many years for example by Technischer Überwachungsverein (Technical Inspection Association).

=== L4 ===
After some experience using L3, Liedtke came to the conclusion that several other Mach concepts were also misplaced. By simplifying the microkernel concepts even further he developed the first L4 kernel which was primarily designed for high performance. To maximise performance, the whole kernel was written in assembly language, and its IPC was 20 times faster than Mach&#x27;s. Such dramatic performance increases are a rare event in operating systems, and Liedtke&#x27;s work triggered new L4 implementations and work on L4-based systems at a number of universities and research institutes, including IBM, where Liedtke started to work in 1996, TU Dresden and UNSW. At IBM&#x27;s Thomas J. Watson Research Center Liedtke and his colleagues continued research on L4 and microkernel based systems in general, especially the Sawmill OS.

=== L4Ka::Hazelnut ===
In 1999, Liedtke took over the Systems Architecture Group at the University of Karlsruhe, where he continued the research into microkernel systems. As a proof of concept that a high performance microkernel could also be constructed in a higher level language, the group developed &quot;L4Ka::Hazelnut&quot;, a C++ version of the kernel that ran on IA-32- and ARM-based machines. The effort was a success, performance was still acceptable, and with its release, the pure assembly language versions of the kernels were effectively discontinued.

=== L4/Fiasco ===
In parallel to the development of L4Ka::Hazelnut, in 1998 the Operating Systems Group TUD:OS of the TU Dresden started to develop their own C++ implementation of the L4 kernel interface, named L4/Fiasco. In contrast to L4Ka::Hazelnut, which allows no concurrency in the kernel, and its successor L4Ka::Pistachio, which allows interrupts in the kernel only at specific preemption points, &quot;L4/Fiasco&quot; was fully preemptible (with the exception of extremely short atomic operations) to achieve a low interrupt latency. This was considered necessary because L4/Fiasco is used as the basis of DROPS, a hard real-time computing capable operating system, also developed at the TU Dresden. However, the complexities of a fully preemptible design prompted later versions of Fiasco to return to the traditional L4 approach of running the kernel with interrupts disabled, except for a limited number of preemption points.

== Cross-platform ==

=== L4Ka::Pistachio ===
Up until the release of L4Ka::Pistachio and newer versions of Fiasco, all L4 microkernels had been inherently tied close to the underlying CPU architecture. The next big shift in L4 development was the development of a cross-platform (platform-independent) application programming interface (API) that still retained the high performance characteristics despite its higher level of portability. Although the underlying concepts of the kernel were the same, the new API provided many significant changes relative to prior L4 versions, including better support for multi-processor systems, looser ties between threads and address spaces, and the introduction of user-level thread control blocks (UTCBs) and virtual registers. After releasing the new L4 API (version X.2 a.k.a. version 4) in early 2001, the System Architecture Group at the University of Karlsruhe implemented a new kernel, &quot;L4Ka::Pistachio&quot;, completely from scratch, now with focus on both high performance and portability. It was released under the two-clause BSD license.

=== Newer Fiasco versions ===
The L4/Fiasco microkernel has also been extensively improved over the years. It now supports several hardware platforms ranging from x86 through AMD64 to several ARM platforms. Notably, a version of Fiasco (Fiasco-UX) can run as a user-level application on Linux.

L4/Fiasco implements several extensions to the L4v2 API. Exception IPC enables the kernel to send CPU exceptions to user-level handler applications. With the help of alien threads, it is possible to perform fine-grained control over system calls. X.2-style UTCBs have been added. Also, Fiasco contains mechanisms for controlling communication rights and kernel-level resource use. On Fiasco, a collection of basic user level services are developed (named L4Env) that among others are used to para-virtualise the current Linux version (4.19 ) (named L4Linux).

=== University of New South Wales and NICTA ===
Development also occurred at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), where developers implemented L4 on several 64-bit platforms. Their work resulted in &quot;L4/MIPS&quot; and &quot;L4/Alpha&quot;, resulting in Liedtke&#x27;s original version being retrospectively named &quot;L4/x86&quot;. Like Liedtke&#x27;s original kernels, the UNSW kernels (written in a mix of assembly and C) were unportable and each implemented from scratch. With the release of the highly portable L4Ka::Pistachio, the UNSW group abandoned their own kernels in favor of producing highly tuned ports of L4Ka::Pistachio, including the fastest-ever reported implementation of message passing (36 cycles on the Itanium architecture). The group has also demonstrated that device drivers can perform equally well at user-level as in-kernel, and developed Wombat, a highly portable version of Linux on L4 that runs on x86, ARM, and MIPS processors. On XScale processors, Wombat context-switching costs are up to 50 times lower than in native Linux.

Later the UNSW group, now at NICTA (formerly &quot;National ICT Australia, Ltd&quot;.), forked L4Ka::Pistachio into a new L4 version named &quot;NICTA::L4-embedded&quot;. It was for use in commercial embedded systems, and consequently the implementation trade-offs favored small memory size and reduced complexity. The API was modified to keep almost all system calls short enough that they need no preemption points in order to ensure high real-time responsiveness.

== Commercial deployment ==
In November 2005, NICTA announced that Qualcomm was deploying NICTA&#x27;s L4 version on their &quot;Mobile Station Modem&quot; chipsets. This led to the use of L4 in mobile phone handsets on sale from late 2006. In August 2006, ERTOS leader and UNSW professor Gernot Heiser spun out a company named Open Kernel Labs (OK Labs) to support commercial L4 users and further develop L4 for commercial use under the brand name &quot;OKL4&quot;, in close collaboration with NICTA. &quot;OKL4 μKernel&quot; Version 2.1, released in April 2008, was the first generally available version of L4 which featured capability-based security. OKL4 μKernel 3.0, released in October 2008, was the last open-source version of OKL4 μKernel. More recent versions are closed source and based on a rewrite to support a native hypervisor variant named the &quot;OKL4 Microvisor&quot;. OK Labs also distributed a paravirtualized Linux named OK:Linux, a descendant of Wombat, and paravirtualized versions of SymbianOS and Android. OK Labs also acquired the rights to &quot;seL4&quot; from NICTA.

OKL4 shipments exceeded 1.5 billion in early 2012, mostly on Qualcomm wireless modem chips. Other deployments include automotive infotainment systems.

Apple A series processors beginning with the A7 contain a Secure Enclave coprocessor running an L4 operating system called sepOS (Secure Enclave Processor OS)
based on the L4-embedded kernel developed at NICTA in 2006.
As a result, L4 ships on all modern Apple devices including Macs with Apple silicon. In 2015 alone, total shipments of iPhone was estimated at 310 million.

== High assurance: seL4 ==
In 2006, the NICTA group commenced a from-scratch design of a third-generation microkernel, named seL4, with the aim of providing a basis for highly secure and reliable systems, suitable for satisfying security requirements such as those of Common Criteria and beyond. From the beginning, development aimed for formal verification of the kernel. To ease meeting the sometimes conflicting requirements of performance and verification, the team used a middle-out software process starting from an executable specification written in the language Haskell.
seL4 uses capability-based security access control to enable formal reasoning about object accessibility.

A formal proof of functional correctness was completed in 2009.
The proof provides a guarantee that the kernel&#x27;s implementation is correct against its specification, and implies that it is free of implementation bugs such as deadlocks, livelocks, buffer overflows, arithmetic exceptions or use of uninitialised variables. seL4 is claimed to be the first-ever general-purpose operating-system kernel that has been verified. The work on seL4 won the 2019 ACM SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award.

seL4 takes a novel approach to kernel resource management, exporting the management of kernel resources to user level and subjects them to the same capability-based access control as user resources. This model, which was also adopted by Barrelfish, simplifies reasoning about isolation properties, and was an enabler for later proofs that seL4 enforces the core security properties of integrity and confidentiality. The NICTA team also proved correctness of the translation from the programming language C to executable machine code, taking the compiler out of the trusted computing base of seL4.
This implies that the high-level security proofs hold for the kernel executable. seL4 is also the first published protected-mode OS kernel with a complete and sound worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis, a prerequisite for its use in hard real-time computing.

On 29 July 2014, NICTA and General Dynamics C4 Systems announced that seL4, with end to end proofs, was now released under open-source licenses.
The kernel source code and proofs are licensed under GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2), and most libraries and tools are under the BSD 2-clause. In April 2020, it was announced that the seL4 Foundation was created under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation to accelerate development and deployment of seL4.

The researchers state that the cost of formal software verification is lower than the cost of engineering traditional &quot;high-assurance&quot; software despite providing much more reliable results. Specifically, the cost of one line of code during the development of seL4 was estimated at around , compared to for traditional high-assurance systems.

Under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) High-Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) program, NICTA together with project partners Rockwell Collins, Galois Inc, the University of Minnesota and Boeing developed a high-assurance drone using seL4, along with other assurance tools and software, with planned technology transfer onto the optionally piloted autonomous Boeing AH-6 Unmanned Little Bird helicopter being developed by Boeing. Final demonstration of the HACMS technology took place in Sterling, VA in April 2017. DARPA also funded several Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contracts related to seL4 under a program started by John Launchbury. Small businesses receiving an seL4-related SBIR included: DornerWorks, Techshot, Wearable Inc, Real Time Innovations, and Critical Technologies.

In October 2023, Nio Inc. announced that their seL4-based SkyOS operating systems will be in mass-produced electric cars from 2024.

In 2023, seL4 won the ACM Software System Award.

<text>Ao (&quot;daylight&quot;) is one of the primal deities who are the unborn forces of nature in Māori mythology. Ao is the personification of light, clouds, and the ordinary world, as opposed to darkness () and the underworld.

He is spoken of under many forms or manifestations, including Aotūroa (&quot;enduring day, this world&quot;) and Aotahi (&quot;bright day, world of light and life&quot;). With his companions Ata (&quot;morning&quot;) and Whaitua (&quot;space&quot;) Ao resists the forces of darkness.

The term &quot;Te Ao Māori&quot;, loosely translated as &quot;The Māori world&quot;, is used to refer to Māori tradition and culture.

== Genealogy ==
Ao appears evolving through the forms Aonui, Aoroa, Aowheneke, Ao-whetara out of the darkness as part of the great cosmological genealogies in Te Arawa&#x27;s traditions, as part of the creation of the universe.

Aonui, Aoroa, Aopouri, Aopotango, Aowhetuma, Aowhekere, Aokahiwahiwa, Aokanapanapa, Aopakakina, Aopakarea, and Aotakawe were also the names of the who were the storm clouds, the children, of Tāwhirimātea, which were sent to punish his brothers after the separation of his parents, Rangi and Papa.

In a version recorded from Hūkiki Te Ahukaramū, a Ngāti Raukawa chief, Te Ao was born out of Te Ata, which itself came from the darkness. Ao&#x27;s last form in Hūkiki&#x27;s version is Te Ao Mārama. A version given by the Kāi Tahu of Moeraki is similar.

== Pan-Polynesian ==
In Tahiti, Aonui was Tāne&#x27;s residence in the sky, and Aoaomaraia was the discoverer of fire; a similar role is taken on by Māui in other parts of Polynesia.

<text>Atea is a deity in several Polynesian cultures, including the Marquesas and Tuamotu Islands, and New Zealand.

==Marquesas Islands==
In the mythology of the Marquesas Islands, Atea is the giver of light. In one legend Atea and Tāne are brothers, the sons of Toho. Another tradition relates that Atea (as light) evolved himself, and then brought forth Ono. Joining forces, they broke up the boundless darkness of the underworld (Po), where Tanaoa, lord of darkness, and Mutu-hei (silence) had lived for eternity. Atea and Ono made war on Tanaoa and Mutu-hei, and defeated them. They confined the gods of night within set boundaries. Out of the struggle came forth Atanua, the dawn. Atea then married Atanua, and their children include the lesser gods and humankind (Tregear 1891:29).

==Tuamotu Islands==
In the mythology of the Tuamotu islands, Atea is killed by Tāne, his second son (Meletinsky 2000:421). Their first son, Tahu, dies of starvation and the two gods switch sexes. Later, Atea tries to kidnap Tane, but Tane escapes to earth and eventually becomes so hungry that he eats a man, thus becoming the first cannibal. Tane declares war on Atea and kills him with the lightning bolts of Fatu-tiri, his ancestor).

==New Zealand==
Friedrich Ratzel in &quot;The History of Mankind&quot; (1896) related the Māori belief that creation commenced with the night then, after untold periods, desire awoke, then longing, then feeling. Thought followed upon the first pulse of life, or the first breath drawn; and upon thought, mental activity. Then sprang up the wish, directed to the sacred mystery or great riddle of life. Later, from the material procreative power of love develops the clinging to existence, permeated by a joyous sense of pleasure. Lastly, Atea, the universe, floated in space, divided by the difference of sex into Rangi and Papa, Heaven and Earth; and individual creations then began.

<doc id="95786" wikidata="Q190052" url="?curid=95786" title="Rain gauge">
<text>A rain gauge (also known as udometer, pluviometer, ombrometer, and hyetometer) is an instrument used by meteorologists and hydrologists to gather and measure the amount of liquid precipitation in a predefined area, over a set period of time. It is used to determine the depth of precipitation (usually in mm) that occurs over a unit area and measure rainfall amount.

==History==
People living in India and the Ancient Greeks began to record rainfall around 400 to 500 BCE. In India the readings were correlated against expected growth. In the Arthashastra, used for example in Magadha, precise standards were set as to grain production. Each state storehouse was equipped with a rain gauge to classify land for taxation purposes. Rainfall measurement was also mentioned in the Jewish text in Palestine. In 1247, the Song Chinese mathematician and inventor Qin Jiushao invented Tianchi basin rain and snow gauges to reference rain, and snowfall measurements, as well as other forms of meteorological data.

In 1441, the Cheugugi was invented during the reign of Sejong the Great of the Joseon dynasty of Korea as the first standardized rain gauge. In 1662, Christopher Wren created the first tipping-bucket rain gauge in Britain in collaboration with Robert Hooke. Hooke also designed a manual gauge with a funnel that made measurements throughout 1695.

Richard Towneley was the first to make systematic rainfall measurements over a period of 15 years from 1677 to 1694, publishing his records in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;. Towneley called for more measurements elsewhere in the country to compare the rainfall in different regions, although only William Derham appears to have taken up Towneley&#x27;s challenge. They jointly published the rainfall measurements for Towneley Park and Upminster in Essex for the years 1697 to 1704.

The naturalist Gilbert White took measurements to determine the mean rainfall from 1779 to 1786, although it was his brother-in-law, Thomas Barker, who made regular and meticulous measurements for 59 years, recording temperature, wind, barometric pressure, rainfall and clouds. His meteorological records are a valuable resource for knowledge of the 18th-century British climate. He was able to demonstrate that the average rainfall varied greatly from year to year with little discernible pattern.

===National coverage and modern gauges===
The meteorologist George James Symons published the first annual volume of &quot;British Rainfall&quot; in 1860. This pioneering work contained rainfall records from 168 land stations in England and Wales. He was elected to the council of the British Meteorological Society in 1863 and made it his life&#x27;s work to investigate rainfall within the British Isles. He set up a voluntary network of observers, who collected data which were returned to him for analysis. So successful was he in this endeavour that by 1866 he was able to show results that gave a fair representation of the distribution of rainfall and the number of recorders gradually increased until the last volume of British Rainfall which he lived to edit, for 1899, contained figures from 3,528 stations — 2,894 in England and Wales, 446 in Scotland, and 188 in Ireland. He also collected old rainfall records going back over a hundred years. In 1870 he produced an account of rainfall in the British Isles starting in 1725.

Due to the ever-increasing numbers of observers, standardisation of the gauges became necessary. Symons began experimenting with new gauges in his own garden. He tried different models with variations in size, shape, and height. In 1863 he began a collaboration with Michael Foster Ward from Calne, Wiltshire, who undertook more extensive investigations. By including Ward and various others around Britain, the investigations continued until 1890. The experiments were remarkable for their planning, execution, and drawing of conclusions. The results of these experiments led to the progressive adoption of the well-known standard gauge, still used by the UK Meteorological Office today, namely, one made of &quot;... copper, with a five-inch funnel having its brass rim one foot above the ground ...&quot;

Most modern rain gauges generally measure the precipitation in millimetres in height collected during a certain period, equivalent to litres per square metre. Previously rain was recorded as inches or points, where one point is equal to 0.254 mm or 0.01 of an inch.

Rain gauge amounts are read either manually or by automatic weather station (AWS). The frequency of readings will depend on the requirements of the collection agency. Some countries will supplement the paid weather observer with a network of volunteers to obtain precipitation data (and other types of weather) for sparsely populated areas.

In most cases the precipitation is not retained, but some stations do submit rainfall and snowfall for testing, which is done to obtain levels of pollutants.

Rain gauges have their limitations. Attempting to collect rain data in a tropical cyclone can be nearly impossible and unreliable (even if the equipment survives) due to wind extremes. Also, rain gauges only indicate rainfall in a localized area. For virtually any gauge, drops will stick to the sides or funnel of the collecting device, such that amounts are very slightly underestimated, and those of .01 inches or .25 mm may be recorded as a &quot;trace&quot;.

Another problem encountered is when the temperature is close to or below freezing. Rain may fall on the funnel and ice or snow may collect in the gauge, blocking subsequent rain. To alleviate this, a gauge may be equipped with an automatic electric heater to keep its moisture-collecting surfaces and sensor slightly above freezing.

Rain gauges should be placed in an open area where there are no buildings, trees, or other obstacles to block the rain. This is also to prevent the water collected on the roofs of buildings or the leaves of trees from dripping into the rain gauge after a rain, resulting in inaccurate readings. Rain gauges can help people comprehend the amount of precipitation fallen down in a certain period of time.

==Types==

Types of rain gauges include graduated cylinders, weighing gauges, tipping bucket gauges, and simply buried pit collectors. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages while collecting rain data.

===U.S. standard rain gauge===
The standard United States National Weather Service rain gauge, developed at the start of the 20th century, consists of an funnel emptying into a graduated cylinder, in diameter, which fits inside a larger container that is in diameter and tall. If the rainwater overflows the graduated inner cylinder, then the larger outer container will catch it. When measurements are taken, then the height of the water in the small graduated cylinder is measured, and the excess overflow in the large container is carefully poured into another graduated cylinder and measured to give the total rainfall. A cone meter is sometimes used to prevent leakage that can result in alteration of the data. In locations using the metric system, the cylinder is usually marked in mm and will measure up to of rainfall. Each horizontal line on the cylinder is . In areas using Imperial units, each horizontal line represents inches.

===Pluviometer of intensities===

The pluviometer of intensities (or Jardi&#x27;s pluviometer) is a tool that measures the average intensity of rainfall in a certain interval of time. It was initially designed to record the rainfall regime in Catalonia but eventually spread throughout the world.

It consists of a rotating drum that rotates at constant speed, this drum drags a graduated sheet of cardboard, which has the time at the abscissa while the y-axis indicates the height of rainfall in mm of rain. This height is recorded with a pen that moves vertically, driven by a buoy, marking on the paper the rainfall over time. Each cardboard sheet is usually used for one day.

As the rain falls, the water collected by the funnel falls into the container and raises the buoy that makes the pen arm rise in the vertical axis, marking the cardboard accordingly. If the rainfall does not vary, the water level in the container remains constant, and while the drum rotates, the pen&#x27;s mark is more or less a horizontal line, proportional to the amount of water that has fallen. When the pen reaches the top edge of the recording paper, it means that the buoy is &quot;up high in the tank&quot; leaving the tip of the conical needle in a way that uncovers the regulating hole, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the maximum flow that the apparatus is able to record. If the rain suddenly decreases, making the container (as it empties) quickly lower the buoy, that movement corresponds to a steep slope line that can reach the bottom of the recorded cardboard if it stops raining.

The rain gauge of intensities allowed precipitation to be recorded over many years, particularly in Barcelona (95 years), apart from many other places around the world, such as Hong Kong.

===Weighing precipitation gauge===
A weighing-type precipitation gauge consists of a storage bin, which is weighed to record the mass. Certain models measure the mass using a pen on a rotating drum, or by using a vibrating wire attached to a data logger. The advantages of this type of gauge over tipping buckets are that it does not underestimate intense rain, and it can measure other forms of precipitation, including rain, hail, and snow. These gauges are, however, more expensive and require more maintenance than tipping bucket gauges.

The weighing-type recording gauge may also contain a device to measure the number of chemicals contained in the location&#x27;s atmosphere. This is extremely helpful for scientists studying the effects of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere and their effects on the levels of the acid rain. Some Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) units use an automated weighing gauge called the AWPAG (All Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauge).

===Tipping bucket rain gauge===

The tipping bucket rain gauge consists of a funnel that collects and channels the precipitation into a small seesaw-like container. After a pre-set amount of precipitation falls, the lever tips, dumping the collected water and sending an electrical signal. An old-style recording device may consist of a pen mounted on an arm attached to a geared wheel that moves once with each signal sent from the collector. In this design, as the wheel turns the pen arm moves either up or down leaving a trace on the graph and at the same time making a loud &quot;click&quot;.

The tipping bucket rain gauge is not as accurate as the standard rain gauge, because the rainfall may stop before the lever has tipped. When the next period of rain begins it may take no more than one or two drops to tip the lever. This would then indicate that a pre-set amount has fallen when only a fraction of that amount has actually fallen. Tipping buckets also tend to underestimate the amount of rainfall, particularly in snowfall and heavy rainfall events. The advantage of the tipping bucket rain gauge is that the character of the rain (light, medium, or heavy) may be easily obtained. Rainfall character is decided by the total amount of rain that has fallen in a set period (usually 1 hour) by counting the number of pulses during that period. Algorithms may be applied to the data as a method of correcting the data for high-intensity rainfall.


Modern tipping rain gauges consist of a plastic collector balanced over a pivot. When it tips, it actuates a switch (such as a reed switch) which is then electronically recorded or transmitted to a remote collection station.

Tipping gauges can also incorporate elements of weighing gauges whereby a strain gauge is fixed to the collection bucket so that the exact rainfall can be read at any moment. Each time the collector tips, the strain gauge (weight sensor) is re-zeroed to null out any drift.

To measure the &quot;water equivalent&quot; of frozen precipitation, a tipping bucket may be heated to melt any ice and snow that is caught in its funnel. Without a heating mechanism, the funnel often becomes clogged during a frozen precipitation event, and thus no precipitation can be measured. Many Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) units use heated tipping buckets to measure precipitation.

===Optical rain gauge===
This type of gauge has a row of collection funnels. In an enclosed space below each is a laser diode and a photo transistor detector. When enough water is collected to make a single drop, it drops from the bottom, falling into the laser beam path. The sensor is set at right angles to the laser so that enough light is scattered to be detected as a sudden flash of lights. The flashes from these photodetectors are then read and transmitted or recorded. Different type of optical range gauges have been used throughout the decades. The technology has also improved.

===Acoustic rain gauge===
Acoustic disdrometers, also referred to as hydrophones, are able to sense the sound signatures for each drop size as rain strikes a water surface within the gauge. Since each sound signature is unique, it is possible to invert the underwater sound field to estimate the drop-size distribution within the rain. Selected moments of the drop-size distribution yield rainfall rate, rainfall accumulation, and other rainfall properties.

<text>Samoan culture tells stories of many different deities. There were deities of the forest, the seas, rain, harvest, villages, and war. There were two types of deities, &quot;atua&quot;, who had non-human origins, and &quot;aitu&quot;, who were of human origin.

Tagaloa was a supreme god who made the islands and the people. Mafuiʻe was the god of earthquakes. There were also a number of war deities. Nafanua, Samoa&#x27;s warrior goddess hails from the village of Falealupo at the western end of Savai&#x27;i island, which is also the site of the entry into Pulotu, the spirit world. She also is regarded as a peace bringer, having brought peace to Savai&#x27;i through winning the wars between the two regions of the island. Tilafaiga is the mother of Nafanua. Nafanua&#x27;s father, Saveasi&#x27;uleo, was the god of Pulotu. Another well-known legend tells of two sisters, Tilafaiga, the mother of Nafanua, and Taema, bringing the art of tattooing to Samoa from Fiji.

A figure of another legend is Tui Fiti, who resides at Fagamalo village in the village district of Matautu. The village of Falelima is associated with a dreaded spirit deity called, &quot;Nifoloa&quot;. The Mata o le Alelo &#x27;Eyes of the Demon&#x27; freshwater pool from the Polynesian legend Sina and the Eel is situated in the village of Matavai on the northern coast in the village district of Safune.

Fetu (&quot;star&quot;) is the god of the night. His wife is Ele&#x27;ele.

Samoan mythology is a variant of a more general Polynesian mythology in the Samoa Islands.

<text>Tongan narrative, Tongan mythology, or ancient Tongan religion, sometimes referred to as tala-ē-fonua (meaning, &quot;telling of the land and its people&quot;) in Tongan, is the collation of various myths, legends, stories, traditions, characters, creatures, spirits, and gods of the Polynesian islands that now make up the island nation of Tonga.

It is a variant of other Polynesian mythologies with multiple cultural and religious overlaps, however it is considered to be distinct from other Polynesian mythologies as it can be studied more specifically to understand the history and culture of Tonga, as well it can also be studied more broadly within the fields of history, anthropology, and mythology.

==Creation myth==
In the beginning there was just the sea and the spirit world, Pulotu, and between them was a rock called Touiao Futuna. On the rock lived Piki and his twin sister, Kele, Atungaki and his twin sister, Maimoao Longona, Fonua&#x27;uta and his twin sister, Fonuavai, and Hemoana and his twin sister, Lupe. Piki lay with his own sister; they had two children, a son, Taufulifonua, and a daughter, Havea Lolofonua; Atungaki also lay with his sister, who bore him a daughter, Velelahi; and Fonuauta lay with his sister. They had a daughter, Velesii.

When Taufulifonua grew to manhood, his sister, Havea Lolofonua, bore him a son, Hikuleʻo, Tangaloa and Maui divided the creation between them. Hikuleo took as his portion, Pulotu, Tangaloa took the sky and Maui the underworld. Hemoana, whose form was the sea snake, and Lupe, whose form was a dove, then divided the remainder between them, Hemoana taking the sea and Lupe taking the land.

Tangaloa had several sons in the sky: Tangaloa Tamapouli Alamafoa, Tangaloa Eitumatupua, Tangaloa Atulongolongo and Tangaloa Tufunga. Old Tangaloa grew tired of looking down from the sky and seeing nothing but sea, so he sent down Tangaloa Atulongolongo in the form of a plover to see if he could find land. All Tangaloa &#x27;Atulongolongo could find was a reef below the water, where Ata is now. So old Tangaloa told Tangaloa Tufunga to throw down into the sea the chips from the wood carving on which he was working. Tangaloa Tufunga continued to do this for a long time, and on two occasion Tangaloa Atulongolongo flew down in the form of a plover to see if anything had happened, but found nothing. On the third occasion, however, he found that the chips had formed an island. This was Eua. Later, Tangaloa Tufunga threw down more chips to form the islands of Kao and Tofua.

Tongatapu and most of the other islands were the work of Maui. One day Maui visited Manuka (Samoan: Manua) and there an old man, Tonga Fusifonua, gave him a fish-hook. Maui went fishing with this hook, but when he tried to pull in his line he found it was caught. He exerted all his strength and succeeded in hauling the line in, to find that he had dragged up Tongatapu from the bottom of the sea. Maui continued fishing with this wonderful hook and so pulled up from the deeps the rest of the islands of Tonga, and some of those of Fiji and Samoa as well.

ʻAta began as a reef below the water and slowly rose out of the sea. One day Tangaloa 
Atulonglongo visited Ata in the form of a plover and dropped a seed from the beak upon the island. The next time he visited &#x27;Ata he found that the seed had grown into a creeper that covered the island. He pecked at the root of this creeper until it split in two. Then he returned to the sky. A few days later he returned to find that the root had rotted and a fat, juicy worm was curled up in it. He pecked the worm in two. From the top section a man was formed called Kohai. The bottom section also turned into a man called Koau. Then the plover felt a morsel left on his beak; he shook it off and it turned into a man called Momo. Kohai, Koau and Momo were the first men in Tonga. Maui brought them wives from Pulotu and they became the ancestors of the Tonga people.

<text>Fijian mythology refers to the set of beliefs practiced by the indigenous people of the island of Fiji. 

Their indigenous religion, like many others around the world, is based on cyclic existence where their ancestors and the environment exist in a dynamic cycle through experience, history and one with nature. Like a plant that bears seeds to exist, similar to humans, animals and all other life dependent of the reproductive cycle to maintain existence on earth. Fijians believe that humans exist with nature and sometimes are dominated by other species like sharks, snakes, octopuses, and more, where humans are the prey, rather than the predator. 

Some primarily examples of their gods are Degei, a serpent who is the supreme god of Uluda Fiji. He is the creator of the (Fijian) world. He judges newly dead souls after they pass through one of two caves: Cibaciba or Drakulu. A few he sends to paradise Burotu or Burotukula. Most others are thrown into a lake, where they will eventually sink to the bottom (Murimuria) to be appropriately rewarded or punished.

<text>In Polynesian mythology (specifically Tikopia), Atua I Raropuka is a creator being, often spoken of in tandem with his wife, Atua Fafine.

Raropuka is the lesser creator-god. He was invoked after the creation of the world within the sky, and was directed to give man all his knowledge.

Which foodstuffs were edible, which animals were to become man&#x27;s totems and which were taboo, as these are either messengers or omens. Taking a totem animal is allowed within the clan of that animal. A man must present at least one of each one of his clan&#x27;s totem animals to the heads of all the other clans to become a man (among other rites of passage). A man who accidentally takes another clan&#x27;s totem animals must give it either an adult male or female member of that animal&#x27;s clan. Typically, the offended clan member forgives the trespass, and will return the totem with the majority of the kill intact, save for the decorative, tool-bearing, or ritualistic portions removed. A woman of any age who finds, or fishes a totem animal may do the portioning on any totem animals within or out-clan if she intends to give the portions to that clan. If a girl wishes to marry, she will actively pursue and portion totem animals and make offerings to the boy she likes.

Raropuka is the creator of medicinal plants (either herbal or drug plants) and all fruit bearing plants. Non-edible plants and flowers bearing non-edible fruits are the work of the original creator god.

<text>In Māori mythology, Atutahi is the name of Canopus, (Alpha Carinae). 
Atutahi is the second brightest star in the night-time sky, second only to Sirius (Takurua). 
&quot;Aotahi&quot;, &quot;Autahi&quot;, and &quot;Atutahi&quot;, &quot;First-light&quot; or &quot;Single-light&quot;, were equivalent names that also intimated the star&#x27;s solitary or self-centered nature.

Atutahi is considered to be a very tapu star, and always dwells alone. This is seen in its position outside the Milky Way.

Of all the stars known to the Māori, Atutahi had a special place, along with Rigel (Puanga), because of their intimate association with kūmara cultivation. Their appearance in the eastern sky was the sign for planting to begin. 
Atutahi and Puanga could be used to foretell the weather.

Atutahi has several different mythologies attached to it as well. One story tells of how Atutahi was left outside of the basket representing the Milky Way when Tane wove it. Another related myth surrounding the star says that Autahi was the first-born child of Rangi, who refused to enter the Milky Way and so turned it sideways and rose before it. The same name is used for other stars and constellations throughout Polynesia.

<text>Conjoined twins, popularly referred to as Siamese twins, are twins joined &quot;in utero&quot;. It is a very rare phenomenon, estimated to occur in anywhere between one in 50,000 births to one in 200,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in southwest Asia and Africa. Approximately half are stillborn, and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1.

Two possible explanations of the cause of conjoined twins have been proposed. The one that is generally accepted is &quot;fission&quot;, in which the fertilized egg splits partially. The other explanation, no longer believed to be accurate, is &quot;fusion&quot;, in which the fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (that search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion, placenta, and amniotic sac &quot;in utero&quot;, but so do some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins.

Chang and Eng Bunker (1811–1874) were brothers born in Siam (now Thailand) who traveled widely for many years and were known internationally as the Siamese Twins. Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh and cartilage, and by their fused livers. In modern times, they could easily have been separated. Due to the brothers&#x27; fame and the rarity of the condition, the term &quot;Siamese twins&quot; came to be associated with conjoined twins.

== Causes ==
There are two hypotheses about the development of conjoined twins.
# a single fertilized egg does not fully split during the process of forming identical twins. If the zygote division occurs after two weeks of the development of the embryonic disc, it results in the formation of conjoined twins.
# fusion of two fertilized eggs occurs early in development.

Partial splitting of the primitive node and streak may result in the formation of conjoined twins. These twins are classified according to the nature and degree of their union. Occasionally, monozygotic twins are connected only by a common skin bridge or by a common liver bridge. The type of twins formed depends on when and to what extent abnormalities of the node and streak occurred. Misexpression of genes, such as goosecoid, may also result in conjoined twins. Goosecoid activates inhibitors of BMP4 and contributes to regulation of head development. Over- or underexpression of this gene in laboratory animals results in severe malformations of the head region, including duplications, similar to some types of conjoined twins.

== Types ==
Conjoined twins are typically classified by the point at which their bodies are joined. The most common types of conjoined twins are:
* &quot;Thoracopagus&quot; (28% of cases): Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart and may also share the liver or part of the digestive system. Survival rate is poor.
* &quot;Thoraco-omphalopagus&quot; (18.5%): Two bodies fused from the upper chest to lower belly. The heart is always shared in these cases. , twins who share a heart have not been able to both survive separation; a designated twin who is allotted the heart may survive if the other twin is sacrificed.
* &quot;Omphalopagus&quot; (10%): Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is not shared; however, the twins often share a liver, a digestive system, a diaphragm and other organs. Survival rate is 82%.
* &quot;Heteropagus&quot; (parasitic twin) (10%): Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin&#x27;s organs for survival.
* &quot;Craniopagus&quot; (6%): Fused skulls, but separate bodies. These twins&#x27; heads may be conjoined at the back, front, or side of the head, but not on the face or at the base of the skull. Survival rate is poor.

Other, less common types of conjoined twins include:
* &quot;Cephalopagus&quot;: Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. This is also known as janiceps (after the two-faced Roman deity Janus).
* &quot;Syncephalus&quot;: One head with a single face but four ears and two bodies.
* &quot;Cephalothoracopagus&quot;: Bodies fused at the head and thorax, with two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes with a single face and an enlarged skull.
* &quot;Xiphopagus&quot;: Two bodies fused in the xiphoid cartilage, which extends approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver. A famous example is Chang and Eng Bunker.
* &quot;Ischiopagus&quot;: Fused lower half of the two bodies, with spines conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one set of external genitalia and one anus. Survival rate is 63%.
* &quot;Omphalo-Ischiopagus&quot;: Fused in a similar fashion to ischiopagus twins, but facing each other, with a joined abdomen, akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs.
* &quot;Parapagus&quot;: Fused side by side with a shared pelvis. Those that are &quot;dithoracic parapagus&quot; are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not at the thorax. Those that are &quot;diprosopic parapagus&quot; have one trunk and two faces. Those that are &quot;dicephalic parapagus&quot; have one trunk and two heads, and may have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms. Survival rate is poor.
* &quot;Craniopagus parasiticus&quot;: Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.
* &quot;Pygopagus&quot; or &quot;Iliopagus&quot;: Two bodies joined at the pelvis. Survival rate is 68%.
* &quot;Rachipagus&quot;: Twins joined along the back of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks. Twins of this type cannot be separated.
* &quot;Tricephalus&quot; (conjoined triplets): Extremely rare conjoining of 3 fetuses. Very few confirmed cases, both human and animal, are known.
==Treatment==
===Separation===
Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. Though there have been a number of successful separations throughout history, in many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the ethics of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. Alice Dreger of Northwestern University found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed. Lori and George Schappell and Abby and Brittany Hensel are notable examples.

The first recorded separation of conjoined twins took place in the Byzantine Empire in the 900s. One of the conjoined twins had already died, so the doctors of the town attempted to separate the dead twin from the surviving twin. The result was briefly successful, as the remaining twin lived for three days after separation. The next recorded case of separating conjoined twins was several centuries later, in Germany, in 1689. The first recorded successful separation of conjoined twins was performed in 1689 by Johannes Fatio. Around this same time Dr. Böhm of Gunzenhausen separated his own children, a pair of omphalopagus or xiphopagus twins; the feebler twin died four days later, but the healthier one was still alive and well at age five, when the case was reported. In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980) and his team at Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate craniopagus twins (conjoined at the head), which resulted in long-term survival for both. The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller girl was permanently impaired.

In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world&#x27;s first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ. Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956. The boys shared a liver but had separate hearts and were successfully separated at North Side Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, by Bertram Katz. The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children&#x27;s Service Society.

Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of Ganga and Jamuna Shrestha in 2001, who were born in Kathmandu, Nepal, in 2000. The 97-hour surgery on the pair of craniopagus twins was a landmark one which took place in Singapore; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh. The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of eight, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection.

Infants Rose and Grace Attard, conjoined twins from Malta, were separated in the United Kingdom by court order &quot;Re A&quot; over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard. The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine. The surgery took place in November 2000, at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Manchester. The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace&#x27;s. However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die. Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood.

In 2003, two 29-year-old women from Iran, Ladan and Laleh Bijani, who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus), were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons&#x27; warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because technologically advanced graphical imagery and modeling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. However, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation. The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery.

In 2019 Safa and Marwa Ullah were separated at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, England. The twins, born January 2017, were joined at the top of the head with separate brains and a cylindrical shared skull with the twins each facing in opposite directions to one another. The surgery was jointly led by neurosurgeon Owase Jeelani and plastic surgeon Professor David Dunaway. The surgery presented particular difficulties due to a number of shared veins and a distortion in the shape of the girls&#x27; brains, causing them to overlap. The distortion would need to be corrected in order for the separation to go ahead. The surgery utilized a team of more than 100 including bio engineers, 3D modelers and a virtual reality designer. The separation was completed in February 2019 following a total of 52 hours of surgery over three separate operations. As of July 2019, both girls remained healthy and the family planned to return to their home in Pakistan in 2020.

== History ==

The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted conjoined twins in their ceramics dating back to 300 CE. Writing around 415 AD, St. Augustine of Hippo, in his book, &quot;City of God&quot;, refers to a man &quot;double in his upper, but single in his lower half—having two heads, two chests, four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man.&quot;

According to Theophanes the Confessor, a Byzantine historian of the 9th century, around 385/386 AD, he writes that &quot;in the village of Emmaus in Palestine, a child was born perfectly normal below the navel but divided above it, so that it had two chests and two heads, each possessing the senses. One would eat and drink but the other did not eat; one would sleep but the other stayed awake. There were times when they played with each other, when both cried and hit each other. They lived for a little over two years. One died while the other lived for another four days and it, too, died.&quot;

In Arabia, the twin brothers Hashim ibn Abd Manaf and &#x27;Abd Shams were born with Hashim&#x27;s leg attached to his twin brother&#x27;s head. Legend says that their father, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai, separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al&#x27;Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn &#x27;Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). The Muslim polymath Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī described conjoined twins in his book &quot;Kitab-al-Saidana&quot;.

The English twin sisters Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst, who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the &quot;Scottish brothers&quot;, allegedly of the dicephalus type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460–1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and Judith of Szőny, Hungary (1701–1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a convent; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of Sardinia, born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.

Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the performing arts, though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, Millie and Christine McCoy (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a showman, J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon kidnapped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as &quot;The Two-Headed Nightingale&quot; and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912, they died of tuberculosis, 17 hours apart.

Giacomo and Giovanni Tocci, from Locana, Italy, were immortalized in Mark Twain&#x27;s short story &quot;Those Extraordinary Twins&quot; as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times, physical therapy allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.
==Notable people==
===Born 19th century and earlier===
*Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst, alleged names of the Biddenden Maids (per tradition, born in the 12th century) of Kent, England. They are the earliest set of conjoined twins whose names are (purportedly) known.
*Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617 — after 1646), autosite-and-parasite pair
*Helen and Judith of Szony (Hungary, 1701 — 1723), pygopagus.
*Chang and Eng Bunker (1811–1874). The Bunker twins were born of Chinese origin in Siam (now Thailand), and the expression &quot;Siamese twins&quot; is derived from their case. They were joined by the areas around their xiphoid cartilages, but over time, the connective tissue stretched.
*In 1834, a set of conjoined triplets were born in Catania. Two of the heads shared a neck while the other head had its own. The infant, a male, was described by Galvagni.
*Millie and Christine McCoy (July 11, 1851 – October 8, 1912), (oblique pygopagus). The McCoy twins were born into slavery in Columbus County, North Carolina, United States. They went by the stage names &quot;The Two-Headed Nightingale&quot; and &quot;The Eighth Wonder of the World&quot; and had an extensive career before retiring to the farm on which they were born.
*Giacomo and Giovanni Battista Tocci (1875? — 1912?), (dicephalus tetrabrachius dipus)
*Josefa and Rosa Blazek (January 20, 1878 — March 30, 1922), pygopagus. The Blazek twins were born in Skrejšov, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic). They began performing in public exhibitions at the age of 13, and their act later included Rosa&#x27;s son Franz. The sisters died in Chicago, Illinois.

===Born 20th century===
*Daisy and Violet Hilton of Brighton, England (1908–1969), pygopagus. The Hilton twins were performers who played musical instruments, sang, and danced. At the height of their career, they had the highest paid act in vaudeville. They also appeared in the movies &quot;Freaks&quot; and &quot;Chained for Life&quot;.
*Lucio and Simplicio Godina of Samar, Philippines (1908–1936)
*Masha and Dasha Krivoshlyapova of Moscow, Russia (1950–2003), the rarest form of conjoined twins, one of few cases of dicephalus tetrabrachius tripus (two heads, four arms, three legs)
*Ronnie and Donnie Galyon of Ohio (1951–2020), omphalopagus; longest-lived conjoined twins in the world at 68 years and 250 days.
*Tjitske and Folkje de Vries of Mûnein, Netherlands (b. 1953), successfully separated in 1954
