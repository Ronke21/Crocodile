<text>Naphthalene is an organic compound with formula . It is the simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and is a white crystalline solid with a characteristic odor that is detectable at concentrations as low as 0.08 ppm by mass. As an aromatic hydrocarbon, naphthalene&#x27;s structure consists of a fused pair of benzene rings. It is the main ingredient of traditional mothballs.

== History ==
In the early 1820s, two separate reports described a white solid with a pungent odor derived from the distillation of coal tar. In 1821, John Kidd cited these two disclosures and then described many of this substance&#x27;s properties and the means of its production. He proposed the name &quot;naphthaline&quot;, as it had been derived from a kind of naphtha (a broad term encompassing any volatile, flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture, including coal tar). Naphthalene&#x27;s chemical formula was determined by Michael Faraday in 1826. The structure of two fused benzene rings was proposed by Emil Erlenmeyer in 1866, and confirmed by Carl Gräbe three years later.

==Physical properties==
A naphthalene molecule can be viewed as the fusion of a pair of benzene rings. (In organic chemistry, rings are &quot;fused&quot; if they share two or more atoms.) As such, naphthalene is classified as a benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH).

The eight carbon atoms that are not shared by the two rings carry one hydrogen atom each. For purpose of the standard IUPAC nomenclature of derived compounds, those eight atoms are numbered 1 through 8 in sequence around the perimeter of the molecule, starting with a carbon atom adjacent to a shared one. The shared carbon atoms are labeled 4a (between 4 and 5) and 8a (between 8 and 1).

===Molecular geometry===
The molecule is planar, like benzene. Unlike benzene, the carbon–carbon bonds in naphthalene are not of the same length. The bonds C1−C2, C3−C4, C5−C6 and C7−C8 are about 1.37 Å (137 pm) in length, whereas the other carbon–carbon bonds are about 1.42 Å (142 pm) long. This difference, established by X-ray diffraction, is consistent with the valence bond model in naphthalene and in particular, with the theorem of cross-conjugation. This theorem would describe naphthalene as an aromatic benzene unit bonded to a diene but not extensively conjugated to it (at least in the ground state), which is consistent with two of its three resonance structures.

Because of this resonance, the molecule has bilateral symmetry across the plane of the shared carbon pair, as well as across the plane that bisects bonds C2-C3 and C6-C7, and across the plane of the carbon atoms. Thus there are two sets of equivalent hydrogen atoms: the &quot;alpha&quot; positions, numbered 1, 4, 5, and 8, and the &quot;beta&quot; positions, 2, 3, 6, and 7. Two isomers are then possible for mono-substituted naphthalenes, corresponding to substitution at an alpha or beta position.

Structural isomers of naphthalene that have two fused aromatic rings include azulene, which has a 5–7 fused ring system, and Bicyclo[6.2.0]decapentaene which has a fused 4–8 ring system.

The point group symmetry of naphthalene is &quot;D2h&quot;.
=== Electrical conductivity ===
Pure crystalline naphthalene is a moderate insulator at room temperature, with resistivity of about 1012 Ω m. The resistivity drops more than a thousandfold on melting, to about 4 × 108 Ω m. Both in the liquid and in the solid, the resistivity depends on temperature as &quot;ρ&quot; = &quot;ρ&quot;0 exp(&quot;E&quot;/(&quot;kT&quot;)), where &quot;ρ&quot;0 (Ω⋅m) and &quot;E&quot; (eV) are constant parameters, &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant (8.617 × 10−5 eV/K), and &quot;T&quot; is absolute temperature (K). The parameter &quot;E&quot; is 0.73 in the solid. However, the solid shows semiconducting character below 100 K.

== Chemical properties ==

=== Reactions with electrophiles ===
In electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, naphthalene reacts more readily than benzene. For example, chlorination and bromination of naphthalene proceeds without a catalyst to give 1-chloronaphthalene and 1-bromonaphthalene, respectively. Likewise, whereas both benzene and naphthalene can be alkylated using Friedel–Crafts reaction conditions, naphthalene can also be easily alkylated by reaction with alkenes or alcohols, using sulfuric or phosphoric acid catalysts. Contrariwise, anhydrous aluminium chloride reacts with naphthalene to give a hexamer, in which one ring of each naphthalene monomer loses aromaticity, linking to the other monomers at the 1 and 4 positions. 

In terms of regiochemistry, electrophiles attack at the alpha position. The selectivity for alpha over beta substitution can be rationalized in terms of the resonance structures of the intermediate: for the alpha substitution intermediate, seven resonance structures can be drawn, of which four preserve an aromatic ring. For beta substitution, the intermediate has only six resonance structures, and only two of these are aromatic. Sulfonation gives the &quot;alpha&quot; product naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid as the kinetic product but naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid as the thermodynamic product. The 1-isomer forms predominantly at 25 °C, and the 2-isomer at 160 °C.
Sulfonation to give the 1- and 2-sulfonic acid occurs readily:
Further sulfonation give di-, tri-, and tetrasulfonic acids.

=== Lithiation ===
Analogous to the synthesis of phenyllithium is the conversion of 1-bromonaphthalene to 1-lithionaphthalene, by lithium–halogen exchange:
: C10H7Br + BuLi → C10H7Li + BuBr
The resulting lithionaphthalene undergoes a second lithiation, in contrast to the behavior of phenyllithium. These 1,8-dilithio derivatives are precursors to a host of peri-naphthalene derivatives.

=== Reduction and oxidation ===
With alkali metals, naphthalene forms the dark blue-green radical anion salts such as sodium naphthalene, Na+C10H. The naphthalene anions are strong reducing agents.

Naphthalene can be hydrogenated under high pressure in the presence of metal catalysts to give 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene(), also known as tetralin. Further hydrogenation yields decahydronaphthalene or decalin ().

Oxidation with in the presence of vanadium pentoxide as catalyst gives phthalic anhydride:
:C10H8 + 4.5 O2 → C6H4(CO)2O + 2 CO2 + 2 H2O
This reaction is the basis of the main use of naphthalene. Oxidation can also be effected using conventional stoichiometric chromate or permanganate reagents.

== Production ==

From the 1960s until the 1990s, significant amounts of naphthalene were produced from heavy petroleum fractions during refining, but present-day production is mainly from coal tar. Approximately 1.3 million tons are produced annually.

Naphthalene is the most abundant single component of coal tar. The composition of coal tar varies with coal type and processing, but typical coal tar is about 10% naphthalene by weight. In industrial practice, distillation of coal tar yields an oil containing about 50% naphthalene, along with twelve other aromatic compounds. This oil, after being washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide to remove acidic components (chiefly various phenols), and with sulfuric acid to remove basic components, undergoes fractional distillation to isolate naphthalene. The crude naphthalene resulting from this process is about 95% naphthalene by weight. The chief impurities are the sulfur-containing aromatic compound benzothiophene (&lt; 2%), indane (0.2%), indene (&lt; 2%), and methylnaphthalene (&lt; 2%). Petroleum-derived naphthalene is usually purer than that derived from coal tar. Where required, crude naphthalene can be further purified by recrystallization from any of a variety of solvents, resulting in 99% naphthalene by weight, referred to as 80 °C (melting point).

In North America, the coal tar producers are Koppers Inc., Ruetgers Canada Inc. and Recochem Inc., and the primary petroleum producer is Monument Chemical Inc. In Western Europe the well-known producers are Koppers, Ruetgers, and Deza. In Eastern Europe, naphthalene is produced by a variety of integrated metallurgy complexes (Severstal, Evraz, Mechel, MMK) in Russia, dedicated naphthalene and phenol makers INKOR, Yenakievsky Metallurgy plant in Ukraine and ArcelorMittal Temirtau in Kazakhstan.

=== Other sources and occurrences ===
Naphthalene and its alkyl homologs are the major constituents of creosote.

Trace amounts of naphthalene are produced by magnolias and some species of deer, as well as the Formosan subterranean termite, possibly produced by the termite as a repellant against &quot;ants, poisonous fungi and nematode worms&quot;. Some strains of the endophytic fungus &quot;Muscodor albus&quot; produce naphthalene among a range of volatile organic compounds, while &quot;Muscodor vitigenus&quot; produces naphthalene almost exclusively.

== Uses ==
Naphthalene is used mainly as a precursor to derivative chemicals. The single largest use of naphthalene is the industrial production of phthalic anhydride, although more phthalic anhydride is made from &quot;o&quot;-xylene.

=== Fumigant ===
Naphthalene has been used as a fumigant. It was once the primary ingredient in mothballs, although its use has largely been replaced in favor of alternatives such as 1,4-dichlorobenzene. In a sealed container containing naphthalene pellets, naphthalene vapors build up to levels toxic to both the adult and larval forms of many moths that attack textiles. Other fumigant uses of naphthalene include use in soil as a fumigant pesticide, in attic spaces to repel insects and animals such as opossums, and in museum storage-drawers and cupboards to protect the contents from attack by insect pests.

=== Solvent ===
Molten naphthalene provides an excellent solubilizing medium for poorly soluble aromatic compounds. In many cases it is more efficient than other high-boiling solvents, such as dichlorobenzene, benzonitrile, nitrobenzene and durene. The reaction of C60 with anthracene is conveniently conducted in refluxing naphthalene to give the 1:1 Diels–Alder adduct. The aromatization of hydroporphyrins has been achieved using a solution of DDQ in naphthalene.

=== Derivative uses ===
The single largest use of naphthalene is the production of phthalic anhydride, which is an intermediate used to make plasticizers for polyvinyl chloride, and to make alkyd resin polymers used in paints and varnishes.

==== Sulfonic acids and sulfonates ====
Many naphthalenesulfonic acids and sulfonates are useful. Naphthalenesulfonic acids are used in the synthesis of 1-naphthol and 2-naphthol, precursors for various dyestuffs, pigments, rubber processing chemicals and other chemicals and pharmaceuticals. They are also used as dispersants in synthetic and natural rubbers, in agricultural pesticides, in dyes, and in lead–acid battery plates. Naphthalenedisulfonic acids such as Armstrong&#x27;s acid are used as precursors and to form pharmaceutical salts such as CFT.

The aminonaphthalenesulfonic acids are precursors for synthesis of many synthetic dyes.

Alkyl naphthalene sulfonates (ANS) are used in many industrial applications as nondetergent surfactants (wetting agents) that effectively disperse colloidal systems in aqueous media. The major commercial applications are in the agricultural chemical industry, which uses ANS for wettable powder and wettable granular (dry-flowable) formulations, and in the textile and fabric industry, which uses the wetting and defoaming properties of ANS for bleaching and dyeing operations.

Some naphthalenesulfonate polymers are superplasticizers used for the production of high strength concrete as well as water reducers in the production of gypsum wallboard. 
They are produced by treating naphthalenesulfonic acid with formaldehyde, followed by neutralization with sodium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide.

==== Other derivative uses ====

Many azo dyes are produced from naphthalene. Useful agrichemicals include naphthoxyacetic acids.

Hydrogenation of naphthalene gives tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin) and decahydronaphthalene (decalin), which are used as low-volatility solvents. Tetralin is used as a hydrogen-donor solvent.

Alkylation of naphthalene with propylene gives a mixture of diisopropylnaphthalenes, which are useful as nonvolatile liquids for inks.

Substituted naphthalenes serve as pharmaceuticals such as propranolol (a beta blocker) and nabumetone (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug).

=== Other uses ===
Several uses stem from naphthalene&#x27;s high volatility: it is used to create artificial pores in the manufacture of high-porosity grinding wheels; it is used in engineering studies of heat transfer using mass sublimation; and it has been explored as a sublimable propellant for cold gas satellite thrusters.

== Health effects ==

Exposure to large amounts of naphthalene may damage or destroy red blood cells, most commonly in people with the inherited condition known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, from which approximately 400 million people suffer. Humans, in particular children, have developed the condition known as hemolytic anemia, after ingesting mothballs or deodorant blocks containing naphthalene. Symptoms include fatigue, lack of appetite, restlessness, and pale skin. Exposure to large amounts of naphthalene may cause confusion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in the urine, and jaundice (yellow coloration of the skin due to dysfunction of the liver).

The US National Toxicology Program (NTP) held an experiment where male and female rats and mice were exposed to naphthalene vapors on weekdays for two years. Both male and female rats exhibited evidence of carcinogenesis with increased incidences of adenoma and neuroblastoma of the nose. Female mice exhibited some evidence of carcinogenesis based on increased incidences of alveolar and bronchiolar adenomas of the lung, while male mice exhibited no evidence of carcinogenesis.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies naphthalene as possibly carcinogenic to humans and animals (Group 2B). The IARC also points out that acute exposure causes cataracts in humans, rats, rabbits, and mice; and that hemolytic anemia (described above) can occur in children and infants after oral or inhalation exposure or after maternal exposure during pregnancy. A probable mechanism for the carcinogenic effects of mothballs and some types of air fresheners containing naphthalene has been identified.

=== Regulation ===
US government agencies have set occupational exposure limits to naphthalene exposure. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set a permissible exposure limit at 10 ppm (50 mg/m3) over an eight-hour time-weighted average. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit at 10 ppm (50 mg/m3) over an eight-hour time-weighted average, as well as a short-term exposure limit at 15 ppm (75 mg/m3). Naphthalene&#x27;s minimum odor threshold is 0.084 ppm for humans.

Mothballs and other products containing naphthalene have been banned within the EU since 2008.

In China, the use of naphthalene in mothballs is forbidden. Danger to human health and the common use of natural camphor are cited as reasons for the ban.

<text>A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in Great Britain, or an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI) in the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland, is a conservation designation denoting a protected area in the United Kingdom and Isle of Man. SSSI/ASSIs are the basic building block of site-based nature conservation legislation and most other legal nature/geological conservation designations in the United Kingdom are based upon them, including national nature reserves, Ramsar sites, Special Protection Areas, and Special Areas of Conservation. The acronym &quot;SSSI&quot; is often pronounced &quot;triple-S I&quot;.

==Selection and conservation==
Sites notified for their biological interest are known as Biological SSSIs (or ASSIs), and those notified for geological or physiographic interest are Geological SSSIs (or ASSIs). Sites may be divided into management units, with some areas including units that are noted for both biological and geological interest.

===Biological===
Biological SSSI/ASSIs may be selected for various reasons, which for Great Britain is governed by published SSSI Selection Guidelines. Within each area, a representative series of the best examples of each significant natural habitat may be notified, and for rarer habitats all examples may be included. Sites of particular significance for various taxonomic groups may be selected (for example birds, dragonflies, butterflies, reptiles, amphibians, etc.)—each of these groups has its own set of selection guidelines.

Conservation of biological SSSI/ASSIs usually involves continuation of the natural and artificial processes which resulted in their development and survival, for example the continued traditional grazing of heathland or chalk grassland.

In England, the designating body for SSSIs, Natural England, selects biological SSSIs from within natural areas which are areas with particular landscape and ecological characteristics, or on a county basis. In Scotland, the designating authority is NatureScot; the role in Wales is performed by Natural Resources Wales (formerly the Countryside Council for Wales). In the Isle of Man the role is performed by the Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture.

===Geological===

Geological SSSI/ASSIs are selected by a different mechanism to biological ones, with a minimalistic system selecting one site for each geological feature in Great Britain. Academic geological specialists have reviewed geological literature, selecting sites within Great Britain of at least national importance for each of the most important features within each geological topic (or &quot;block&quot;). Each of these sites is described, with most published in the Geological Conservation Review series, and so becomes a &quot;GCR site&quot;. Almost all GCR sites (but no other sites) are subsequently notified as geological SSSIs, except some that coincide with designated biological SSSI management units. A GCR site may contain features from several different topic blocks, for example a site may contain strata containing vertebrate fossils, insect fossils and plant fossils and it may also be of importance for stratigraphy.

Geological sites fall into two types, having different conservation priorities: exposure sites, and deposit sites. Exposure sites are where quarries, disused railway cuttings, cliffs or outcrops give access to extensive geological features, such as particular rock layers. If the exposure becomes obscured, the feature could in principle be re-exposed elsewhere. Conservation of these sites usually concentrates on maintenance of access for future study. Deposit sites are features which are limited in extent or physically delicate—for example, they include small lenses of sediment, mine tailings, caves and other landforms. If such features become damaged they cannot be recreated, and conservation usually involves protecting the feature from erosion or other damage.

==Legal status==
Following devolution, legal arrangements for SSSIs (Scotland, England, Wales) and ASSIs (Northern Ireland) differ between the countries of the UK. The Isle of Man ASSI system is a separate entity.

NatureScot publishes a summary of the SSSI arrangements for SSSI owners and occupiers (other than public bodies) which can be downloaded from its website. Legal documents for all SSSIs in Scotland are available on the SSSI Register, hosted by The Registers of Scotland. Further information about SSSIs in Scotland is available on the NatureScot website.

The decision to notify an SSSI is made by the relevant nature conservation body (the &quot;appropriate conservation body&quot;) for that part of the United Kingdom: Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Natural England, NatureScot or Natural Resources Wales. SSSIs were originally set up by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, but the current legal framework for SSSIs is provided in England and Wales by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, amended in 1985 and further substantially amended in 2000 (by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000), in Scotland by the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 and in Northern Ireland by the Nature Conservation and Amenity Lands (Northern Ireland) Order 1985. SSSIs are also covered under the Water Resources Act 1991 and related legislation.

An SSSI may be made on any area of land which is considered to be of special interest by virtue of its fauna, flora, geological or physiographical / geomorphological features.

SSSI notification can cover any &quot;land&quot; within the area of the relevant nature conservation body, including dry land, land covered by fresh water. The extent to which an SSSI/ASSI may extend seawards differs between countries. In Scotland an SSSI may include the intertidal land down to mean low water spring or to the extent of the local planning authority area, thus only limited areas of estuaries and coastal waters beyond MLWS may be included. In England, Natural England may notify an SSSI over estuarial waters and further adjacent waters in certain circumstances (section 28(1A &amp; 1B) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as amended by Part 2 of Annex 13 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2010).

Access to SSSIs is the same as for the rest of the countryside of the relevant country. Most SSSIs/ASSIs are in private ownership and form parts of working farms, forests and estates. In Scotland, people may use their rights of responsible access to visit SSSIs.

When designating an SSSI/ASSI, the relevant nature conservation body must formally notify the interested parties and allow a period for them to make representations before confirming the notification. When creating a new SSSI/ASSI the designation has legal effect from the date of notification. The interested parties include central government, local planning authorities, national park authorities, all the owners and occupiers of the land, relevant public bodies such as the utility providers e.g., water companies. In Scotland, NatureScot must also notify the relevant community councils and community group having registered an interest in the land.

The notification includes a description of the land and the natural features for which it is notified (&quot;the citation&quot;), a boundary map, and a list of the acts or omissions (activities) that the nature conservation body regulates through the issue of consents.

The various laws protect the interest features of SSSIs from development, from other damage, and (since 2000 in England) also from neglect. Protection is not necessarily absolute—generally it requires the SSSI interest to be considered properly against other factors.

Local planning authorities are required to have policies in their development plans which protect SSSIs. They are then required to consult the appropriate conservation body over planning applications which might affect the interest of an SSSI (such a development might not be within or even close to the SSSI itself). The effect of this is to prevent development which harms the interest – except where the value of that interest is over-ridden by some more important factor, for example a requirement for a major road or port or oil pipe. The requirement for consultation covers any development which might affect the interest, not just developments within the SSSI itself – for example, a development a long way upstream of a wetland SSSI might require consultation. Some developments might be neutral or beneficial, even if they are within the SSSI itself – the critical point is whether they harm the interest features.

The owners and occupiers of SSSIs are required (Scotland, England, Wales) to obtain consent from the relevant nature conservation body if they want to carry out, cause or permit to be carried out within the SSSI any of the activities listed in the notification. Formerly these activities were called &#x27;potentially damaging operations&#x27; or PDOs. Under the current legal arrangements they are called &#x27;operations requiring consent&#x27; or ORCs (Scotland), or &#x27;operations likely to damage the SSSI interest&#x27; or OLDs (England &amp; Wales). The list of ORCs/OLDs for each SSSI is unique to that site – though all are derived from a standard list for that country. The ORCs/OLDs are not &quot;banned&quot; activities – the list includes activities which would damage the interest, but also many which might be beneficial. For example, &quot;grazing&quot; (a standard item on the list) would require consent, even on a chalk grassland or heathland where grazing is an essential part of management. In England and Wales the list of OLDs is almost the same for each SSSI – and the list for an SSSI will only omit activities impossible on the particular SSSI (such as fishing where there is no water), and things requiring planning permission (which are covered by the local planning authority consultation process). In Scotland, and following the implementation of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004, Scottish Natural Heritage (the former name for NatureScot) reviewed the ORC lists for each SSSI and removed those activities that were unlikely to happen and if they were to would be unlikely to damage the protected natural features, and other activities adequately regulated by other statutory regimes. The intention of this was to remove the need for owners and occupiers to obtain SSSI consent as well as licences/ permits from other authorities (who must consult NatureScot prior to determining such applications). Purely geological SSSIs often have much shorter OLD lists.

If a proposed activity would not affect the interest or is beneficial to it, then the conservation body will issue a &quot;consent&quot; allowing it to be carried out without further consultation. If it would be harmful, the conservation body may issue consent subject to conditions or refuse the application. If consent in writing is not given the operation must not proceed. Conditions may cover any relevant aspect of the proposed operation and may, for example, limit its timing, location or intensity. The process is slightly different where the owner or occupier is a public body, but the effect is broadly similar.

The relevant nature conservation body sends all SSSI owners and occupiers a site-specific &#x27;site management statement&#x27; describing the ideal management (there may be grants available to help fund management). Owners and occupiers are encouraged to carry out this management, which in many (but not all) cases will be a continuation of the historical management of the land. Where an owner or occupier is unwilling or unable to carry out management, ultimately the conservation body can require it to be done. Public bodies which own or occupy an SSSI have a duty to manage it properly. Site management statements for SSSI in Scotland are available to download from the NatureScot website using the &quot;Sitelink&quot; facility.

The law protecting SSSIs now covers everyone, not just public bodies and the owners and occupiers of SSSIs. Previously, activities by &quot;third parties&quot; were not illegal under the SSSI legislation. This meant that damaging activities such as fly-tipping, intensive bait-digging or trail biking on an SSSI were only prevented if done (or permitted) by the owner or occupier – not if done by trespassers or under public rights. The effect was, for example, to allow control of legal trail biking on SSSIs (where damaging to the interest), but not illegal trail biking. This loophole was closed by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and section 19 of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004.

Funding for the monitoring of SSSIs in England has been cut from £1.58 million in 2010 to £700,000 in 2018, causing concern that many have not been inspected over the last six years, as required by guidelines. Since the referendum to leave the EU in 2016, more than 450 staff have been transferred to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Neglected areas include Exmoor, the Lake District, the Pennines, and The Wash.

==Notification==
The process of designating a site as of Special Scientific Interest is called notification; this is followed by consultation with the site&#x27;s owners and occupiers, and the notification is then confirmed or withdrawn (in whole or part). At the time of the passing of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, many SSSIs were already in existence, having been notified over the previous decades under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Each of these was considered in turn, and either denotified, or &quot;renotified&quot;—brought under the provisions of the new Act, often with boundary changes. This complex process took some ten years to complete for the several thousand SSSIs.

For the purposes of selecting the original tranche of SSSIs, Natural England&#x27;s predecessors (the Nature Conservancy, the Nature Conservancy Council and English Nature) used a system termed &quot;areas of search&quot; (AOSs). In England these were largely based on the 1974–1996 administrative counties (with larger counties divided into two or more areas), whereas in Scotland and Wales they are based around districts. The individual AOSs are between and in size. There were 59 AOSs in England, 12 in Wales, and 44 in Scotland. Watsonian vice-counties were formerly used for selection over the whole of Great Britain.

<doc id="99431" wikidata="Q1053286" url="?curid=99431" title="Advanced Encryption Standard process">
<text>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the symmetric block cipher ratified as a standard by National Institute of Standards and Technology of the United States (NIST), was chosen using a process lasting from 1997 to 2000 that was markedly more open and transparent than its predecessor, the Data Encryption Standard (DES). This process won praise from the open cryptographic community, and helped to increase confidence in the security of the winning algorithm from those who were suspicious of backdoors in the predecessor, DES.

A new standard was needed primarily because DES had a relatively small 56-bit key which was becoming vulnerable to brute-force attacks. In addition, the DES was designed primarily for hardware and was relatively slow when implemented in software. While Triple-DES avoids the problem of a small key size, it is very slow even in hardware, it is unsuitable for limited-resource platforms, and it may be affected by potential security issues connected with the (today comparatively small) block size of 64 bits.

==Start of the process==
On January 2, 1997, NIST announced that they wished to choose a successor to DES to be known as AES. Like DES, this was to be &quot;an unclassified, publicly disclosed encryption algorithm capable of protecting sensitive government information well into the next century.&quot; However, rather than simply publishing a successor, NIST asked for input from interested parties on how the successor should be chosen. Interest from the open cryptographic community was immediately intense, and NIST received a great many submissions during the three-month comment period.

The result of this feedback was a call for new algorithms on September 12, 1997. The algorithms were all to be block ciphers, supporting a block size of 128 bits and key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. Such ciphers were rare at the time of the announcement; the best known was probably Square.

==Rounds one, two, and three==
In the nine months that followed, fifteen designs were created and submitted from several countries. They were, in alphabetical order: CAST-256, CRYPTON, DEAL, DFC, E2, FROG, HPC, LOKI97, MAGENTA, MARS, RC6, Rijndael, SAFER+, Serpent, and Twofish.

In the ensuing debate, many advantages and disadvantages of the candidates were investigated by cryptographers; they were assessed not only on security, but also on performance in a variety of settings (PCs of various architectures, smart cards, hardware implementations) and on their feasibility in limited environments (smart cards with very limited memory, low gate count implementations, FPGAs).

Some designs fell due to cryptanalysis that ranged from minor flaws to significant attacks, while others lost favour due to poor performance in various environments or through having little to offer over other candidates. NIST held two conferences to discuss the submissions (AES1, August 1998 and AES2, March 1999), and in August 1999 they announced that they were narrowing the field from fifteen to five: MARS, RC6, Rijndael, Serpent, and Twofish. All five algorithms, commonly referred to as &quot;AES finalists&quot;, were designed by cryptographers considered well-known and respected in the community.
The AES2 conference votes were as follows:

*Rijndael: 77 positive, 1 negative
*RC6: 79 positive, 6 negative
*Twofish: 64 positive, 3 negative
*MARS: 58 positive, 6 negative
*Serpent: 52 positive, 7 negative
*E2: 27 positive, 13 negative
*CAST-256: 16 positive, 18 negative
*SAFER+: 20 positive, 24 negative
*DFC: 22 positive, 27 negative
*Crypton: 16 positive, 31 negative
*DEAL: 1 positive, 71 negative
*HPC: 1 positive, 78 negative
*MAGENTA: 1 positive, 84 negative
*Frog: 1 positive, 86 negative
*LOKI97: 1 positive, 86 negative

A further round of intense analysis and cryptanalysis followed, culminating in the AES3 conference in April 2000, at which a representative of each of the final five teams made a presentation arguing why their design should be chosen as the AES. The AES3 conference votes were as follows:

*Rijndael: 86 positive, 10 negative
*Serpent: 59 positive, 7 negative
*Twofish: 31 positive, 21 negative
*RC6: 23 positive, 37 negative
*MARS: 13 positive, 84 negative

==Selection of the winner==
On October 2, 2000, NIST announced that Rijndael had been selected as the proposed AES and started the process of making it the official standard by publishing an announcement in the Federal Register on February 28, 2001 for the draft FIPS to solicit comments. On November 26, 2001, NIST announced that AES was approved as FIPS PUB 197.

NIST won praises from the cryptographic community for the openness and care with which they ran the standards process. Bruce Schneier, one of the authors of the losing Twofish algorithm, wrote after the competition was over that &quot;I have nothing but good things to say about NIST and the AES process.&quot;

<text>Reedham is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk and within The Broads. It is on the north bank of the River Yare, east of the city of Norwich, south-west of the town of Great Yarmouth and the same distance north-west of the Suffolk town of Lowestoft. The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;reedy homestead/village&#x27; or &#x27;reedy hemmed-in land&#x27;.

==History==

Before the draining of the marshes towards Great Yarmouth, Reedham was a coastal village which included a Roman lighthouse. Fragments of Roman brick and stone can be found in the local church.

King Edmund of East Anglia is said to have lived here. The Fastolf family, whose most celebrated member was Sir John Fastolf, are recorded here from the 13th century.

Polkey&#x27;s Mill is a derelict grade II* listed windpump dating from about 1880.

On 21 February 1944, two United States Air Force B-17s from the 385th Bombardment Group collided above Reedham. All 21 crew members died in the crash. The two bombers were on their way back to RAF Great Ashfield after a bombing run on Diepholz Air Base. 

==Geography==
The civil parish includes a significant area of nearby marshland, together with the famously isolated settlement of Berney Arms. It has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 925 in 406 households, increasing to a population of 1,207 in 505 households at the 2011 census.

For the purposes of local government, the parish lies within the district of Broadland.

==Transport==
Reedham railway station is a stop on the Wherry Lines. Services provided by Greater Anglia connect the village with , and (via ). The line to Lowestoft crosses the river on Reedham Swing Bridge.

Reedham Ferry, a chain ferry just outside the village, is the only road crossing point on the River Yare between Norwich and Great Yarmouth.

The village is served by two bus routes, operated by &quot;Our Bus&quot; and &quot;Ambassador Travel&quot;; they link the area to Acle, Beighton, Cantley and Gorleston.

<doc id="99434" wikidata="Q168708" url="?curid=99434" title="Dallas (1978 TV series)">
<text>Dallas is an American prime time soap opera that aired on CBS from April 2, 1978, to May 3, 1991. The series revolved around an affluent and feuding Texas family, the Ewings, who owned the independent oil company Ewing Oil and the cattle-ranching land of Southfork. The series originally focused on the marriage of Bobby Ewing and Pam Ewing, whose families were sworn enemies. As the series progressed, Bobby&#x27;s elder brother, oil tycoon J. R. Ewing, became the show&#x27;s breakout character, whose schemes and dirty business became the show&#x27;s trademark. When the show ended on May 3, 1991, J. R. was the only character to have appeared in every episode.

The show was prominent for its cliffhangers, including the &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot; mystery. The 1980 episode &quot;Who Done It&quot; remains the second-highest-rated primetime telecast ever. The show also featured a &quot;Dream Season&quot;, in which the entirety of season 9 was revealed to have been a dream of Pamela Ewing. After 14 seasons, the series finale &quot;Conundrum&quot; aired in 1991.

The show had an ensemble cast, with Larry Hagman as greedy, scheming oil tycoon J.R. Ewing, stage/screen actress Barbara Bel Geddes as family matriarch Miss Ellie and Western movie actor Jim Davis as Ewing patriarch Jock, his last role before his death in 1981. The series won four Emmy Awards, including a 1980 Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Bel Geddes.

With its 357 episodes, &quot;Dallas&quot; remains one of the longest lasting full-hour prime time dramas in American TV history, behind &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (635 episodes), &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (551 episodes as of May 2024), &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (501 episodes as of May 2024), &quot;NCIS&quot; (467 episodes as of May 2024), &quot;Bonanza&quot; (430 episodes), and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (428 episodes as of May 2024). &quot;Dallas&quot; also spawned spin-off series &quot;Knots Landing&quot; in 1979, which also lasted 14 seasons and a total of 344 episodes.

In 2007, &quot;Dallas&quot; was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All-Time&quot;.

The series finale had a cliffhanger that was resolved in the first of two subsequent reunion films: &quot;&quot;. There was a second film &quot;&quot;, and a retrospective special &quot;Dallas Reunion: The Return to Southfork&quot;.

In 2010, TNT announced it had ordered a new, updated continuation of &quot;Dallas&quot;, ignoring the events of the two reunion films. The revival series, continuing the story of the Ewing family, premiered on TNT on June 13, 2012, and ran for three seasons, ending its run on September 22, 2014.

==Original premise==
&quot;Dallas&quot; debuted on April 2, 1978, as a five-part miniseries on CBS. Although the miniseries was created as the series&#x27; pilot, by the time it was aired, neither the producers nor the network were hopeful that it would continue beyond these five episodes and had no plans for expansion. It was shown in a late Sunday night time-slot, known for low ratings. However, the miniseries proved popular enough to be turned into a regular series and broadcast for 13 full seasons from September 23, 1978, to May 3, 1991. The five pilot episodes, originally considered a miniseries, are now referred to as season 1, making fourteen seasons in total.

The show is known for its portrayal of wealth, sex, intrigue, conflict and power struggles. Throughout the series, the main premise is the longtime rivalry between the Ewing and Barnes families, which came to head when the Barnes daughter Pamela (Victoria Principal) eloped with youngest Ewing son Bobby (Patrick Duffy), in the first episode. The series is largely set in Dallas, Texas, and fictional Braddock County, where the Southfork Ranch is located.
The backstory was that, in the 1930s, wildcatter John Ross &quot;Jock&quot; Ewing (Jim Davis) had allegedly cheated his one-time partner, Willard &quot;Digger&quot; Barnes (David Wayne/Keenan Wynn), out of his share of their company Ewing Oil, and married Digger&#x27;s only love, Eleanor &quot;Miss Ellie&quot; Southworth (Barbara Bel Geddes/Donna Reed). In contrast to Jock, Miss Ellie came from a long line of ranchers with great love for the land and the cattle. Following their marriage, the Southworth family ranch, Southfork, became the Ewings&#x27; home, where Jock and Miss Ellie raised three sons: J.R. (Larry Hagman), Gary (David Ackroyd/Ted Shackelford) and Bobby (Patrick Duffy).

J.R., unscrupulous and unhappily married to former Miss Texas beauty queen Sue Ellen Shepard (Linda Gray), was frequently at odds with Bobby, who had the morals and integrity that J.R. lacked. Middle son Gary was Miss Ellie&#x27;s favorite as he displayed Southworth traits; however, Gary had been in conflict with both Jock and J.R. since childhood and was dismissed as a weak link. At 17, Gary secretly met and married 15-year-old waitress Valene Clements (Joan Van Ark), producing the first Ewing grandchild - petite and saucy Lucy (Charlene Tilton) - before returning to Southfork with the intention of settling down. Although Jock warmed to Valene and supported Gary&#x27;s fledgling family, J.R. pressured Gary into alcoholism by landing him with bad business deals that caused him to flee Southfork. With Gary gone, J.R. persecuted Valene until she left the ranch and the state, leaving Lucy to be raised by her grandparents.

During the first episodes of the series, teenage Lucy is seen sleeping with ranch foreman Ray Krebbs (Steve Kanaly). Later, in season 4, Ray was revealed as Lucy&#x27;s uncle, an illegitimate son of Jock&#x27;s through an extramarital affair during World War II. Unhappy with his small, one-dimensional role, Kanaly had considered leaving the show; to add depth to the Ray character, Hagman suggested that the writers create a plot wherein Ray becomes half-brother to J.R., Gary, and Bobby, noting his resemblance to Davis. The episodes where Ray and his niece Lucy had a fling are, as Kanaly told Dinah Shore in an appearance on her show, &quot;prayerfully forgotten, I hope&quot;.

Ray had previously engaged in a short fling with Pamela, but she fell deeply in love with Bobby, and the pilot episode begins with the two of them arriving at Southfork Ranch as newlyweds, shocking the entire family. J.R., who loathed the Barnes family, was not happy with Pam&#x27;s living at Southfork, and constantly tried to undermine her marriage to Bobby. Meanwhile, Pam&#x27;s brother Cliff (Ken Kercheval), who had inherited Digger&#x27;s hatred towards the Ewings, shared J.R.&#x27;s objections to the marriage and continued his father&#x27;s quest to get revenge.

Most of the seasons ended with ratings-grabbing cliffhangers, the most notable being the season 3 finale &quot;A House Divided&quot;, which launched the landmark &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot; storyline and was ranked No. 69 on &quot;TV Guide&quot; list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Top 100 Episodes of All Time&quot;. Other season finale cliffhangers include an unidentified female corpse in the Southfork swimming pool (season 4); a blazing house fire (season 6); Bobby&#x27;s death (season 8) and subsequent resurrection (season 9); and J.R.&#x27;s apparent suicide (season 14).

==Cast and characters==

===Main cast===

For the original five-episodes miniseries (season 1) six actors received star billing: Barbara Bel Geddes as matriarch Miss Ellie Ewing, whose family were the original owners of Southfork; Jim Davis as her husband Jock Ewing, the founder of Ewing Oil and head of the Ewing family; Patrick Duffy as their youngest son, Bobby; Victoria Principal as Pamela Barnes Ewing, the daughter of the rival Barnes family whom Bobby brings home as his wife in the pilot episode; Larry Hagman as J.R. Ewing, the oldest son, who strongly objects to his new sister-in-law; and Charlene Tilton as Lucy, Bobby&#x27;s. J.R&#x27;s. and Ray&#x27;s teenage niece, who adores Bobby, Ray but resents J.R. for disposing of her parents in order for her to be raised by &quot;true Ewings&quot;.

Not receiving top billing during season 1, although appearing in the majority of the episodes, were Linda Gray as Sue Ellen, J.R.&#x27;s long-suffering, alcoholic wife; Steve Kanaly as Pam&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Ray Krebbs, a Southfork ranch hand who would later turn out to be Jock&#x27;s illegitimate son; and Ken Kercheval as Pam&#x27;s brother Cliff Barnes, J.R.&#x27;s archrival. Gray and Kanaly were promoted to the regular cast as of the first episode of season 2 and Kercheval as of the first episode of season 3. David Wayne received guest star billing as Willard &quot;Digger&quot; Barnes.

Further on in the series, several new characters were added as the original actors departed the series:

For season 5, after guest starring since season 2, Susan Howard joined the main cast as Donna Culver Krebbs, politician and widow of a former Texas governor, who becomes Ray&#x27;s first wife and mother to his daughter Margaret.

Season 8 saw Howard Keel promoted to the star cast after appearing since season 4 as wealthy, occasionally hot-tempered rancher Clayton Farlow, Miss Ellie&#x27;s husband following Jock&#x27;s death, and of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley as Bobby&#x27;s teenage sweetheart Jenna Wade, who gives birth to Bobby&#x27;s only biological child, Lucas, and eventually becomes Ray&#x27;s second wife. Jenna had previously been played by Morgan Fairchild for a season 2 episode, and Francine Tacker for two episodes in season 3 before the role was permanently taken over by Presley in season 7. Donna Reed also joined the main cast during season 8, temporarily portraying Miss Ellie until Barbara Bel Geddes returned in the following year.

Dack Rambo, portraying wandering cousin Jack Ewing, was promoted to regular status for season 10, after having appeared regularly since the end of season 8. However, he was written out of the show midway through the tenth season. Jack&#x27;s sister Jamie Ewing Jenilee Harrison appeared in season 8. Jack&#x27;s ex-wife April Stevens Ewing, played by Sheree J. Wilson, first appeared during seasons 10 and 11, before being promoted to a main character for season 12. Originally a scheming character, April eventually became Bobby&#x27;s second wife after his divorce from Pam.

Season 13 saw several additions to the main cast: Academy Award winner George Kennedy as Carter McKay, who buys Ray&#x27;s ranch and eventually becomes the head of Ewing Oil rival WestStar; Cathy Podewell as the young and naïve Cally Harper Ewing, J.R.&#x27;s second wife, whom he married to escape false rape charges; Sasha Mitchell as J.R.&#x27;s illegitimate firstborn son, James Beaumont; Kimberly Foster as April&#x27;s devious sister Michelle Stevens, who marries both James and Cliff Barnes; and finally Lesley-Anne Down as PR woman Stephanie Rogers. While Kennedy and Podewell had appeared regularly throughout season 12, Mitchell, Foster and Down&#x27;s characters were all new to the series when they joined the regular cast.

Finally, for the 14th and final season, after guest starring in the last episodes of season 13, Barbara Stock joined the cast as Cliff&#x27;s fiancée Liz Adams.

Widely known supporting actor Tina Louise played J.R.&#x27;s secretary, Julie Grey, during the first two seasons before her character was killed off.

===Main cast departures===
By the end of the series, only three of the series&#x27; original characters (J.R., Bobby, and Cliff) were left in Dallas, the others having either died or left town.

Jock Ewing was the first main character to depart the series, as Jock died offscreen in a mysterious helicopter crash in South America, during season 5. Actor Jim Davis, who played Jock, had died just after production had completed on season 4 in 1981.

Bobby Ewing&#x27;s death in the season 8 finale, alongside his subsequent absence during the following season, was explained away at the beginning of season 10 as having been dreamed by Pamela, thus erasing everything that had happened during season 9. Patrick Duffy had left the series to pursue other opportunities, but due to declining ratings, he was convinced to return to the series by production company Lorimar as well as by series star Larry Hagman.

Jack Ewing left Dallas to continue his travels and get away from J.R., midway through season 10, and returned a final time for two episodes towards the end of the season. While there has been no official reason as to why actor Dack Rambo was written out of &quot;Dallas&quot;, Rambo himself later stated that he believed the reasons to be his bisexuality or his conflicts with Larry Hagman, which Rambo said had particularly intensified during his last season on the show (season 10). Before &quot;Dallas&quot;, Rambo and Hagman had worked together on &quot;Sword of Justice&quot; in the late 1970s. Hagman later denied any involvement in Rambo&#x27;s dismissal from &quot;Dallas&quot;.

Pamela was severely burned after driving a car into an oil tanker, which then exploded into flames, in the season 10 finale in 1987. During season 11, Pam disappeared after her half-sister Katherine was seen around the hospital, with Pam seemingly leaving Bobby and Christopher due to her unwillingness to let them see her in such a physically disfigured fashion. While Victoria Principal never returned to &quot;Dallas&quot; again after the season 10 finale, Margaret Michaels, a Principal look-alike, played Pam in the opening episode of season 12. Having undergone plastic surgery which explained the difference in her appearance, it was revealed that Pam was dying of a disease, though only she and her doctor knew about this. After this episode, Pam is never seen again. Unable to reach a salary agreement and having a desire to start her own business, it was Principal&#x27;s own decision not to return to the show after the season 10 finale.

Budget cuts also meant other long term cast members were let go. In addition to Pamela&#x27;s departure, Ray and Donna divorced at the end of season 10. Donna moving to Washington, D.C., where she later married Senator Andrew Dowling (guest star Jim McMullan), with whom she raised Ray&#x27;s daughter Margaret. Actress Susan Howard stated in 1987 that the producers had told her that her character had run its course. As season 11 ended, Ray sold his ranch to Carter McKay and left Dallas for Switzerland with Jenna and Lucas, Charlie having already moved there to attend a finishing school. Ray returned for five episodes in the early period of season 12.

Lucy Ewing, who had left with husband Mitch at the end of season 8, returned to Southfork in the final episodes of season 11, only to leave again two years later for Europe. On both occasions, Charlene Tilton&#x27;s axing was a decision made by the creative team, who had difficulties creating storylines for her.

Sue Ellen left in the season 12 finale, moving to London with her new husband, film director Don Lockwood (guest star Ian McShane). While Linda Gray was let go by the same budget cuts that ended Steve Kanaly&#x27;s run on the show, Sue Ellen&#x27;s exit has since been described by Gray as a mutual decision by her and Leonard Katzman, agreeing that the character &quot;had come more than full circle&quot;.

Stephanie Rogers was let go as Cliff&#x27;s PR representative at the end of season 13, making actress Lesley-Anne Down the most short-lived member of the regular cast, appearing in 8 episodes and being on the opening title sequence in 13 episodes.

Barbara Bel Geddes had quadruple heart bypass surgery on March 15, 1983, just days after finishing her last scenes on season 6. Bel Geddes then missed the first 11 episodes of season 7, as she had a period of rest and recuperation following the surgery. After the season 7 finale, Bel Geddes left &quot;Dallas&quot; entirely after disagreements over her workload and salary in the period following her heart surgery. The role of Miss Ellie was then recast with Donna Reed for season 8, with Reed signing a 3-year contract. Bel Geddes was asked to return for the start of season 9, a request to which Bel Geddes agreed, resulting in a high-profile public relations debacle that left Reed infuriated and in litigation with the series producers, who eventually made Reed a $1 million out-of-court settlement. Reed died unexpectedly of pancreatic cancer a few months later, in January 1986. Miss Ellie remained on the show until near the end of season 13, when she and Clayton left Dallas, deciding to travel around Far East Asia before eventually settling in Europe near Ray and Jenna. Following her exit from &quot;Dallas&quot; in 1990, Bel Geddes retired from acting.

When the 14th and final season of the series commenced, ten actors received regular cast status. Although half of them left the show prior to the series finale, all of them remained billed in the series&#x27; opening sequence throughout the year. Clayton Farlow made four appearances, clearing up business that included deeding Southfork to Bobby; April Stevens Ewing died early on in the season, kidnapped on her honeymoon by Hillary Taylor (guest star Susan Lucci); Cally Harper Ewing left midway through the season to build a new life, with a new boyfriend and her and J.R.&#x27;s newborn son; Liz Adams broke her engagement to Cliff and left near the end of the season, and James Beaumont left the show a couple of episodes prior to the series finale, to start a new life on the east coast with his newly discovered toddler son Jimmy, and Jimmy&#x27;s mother Debra Lynn (guest star Deborah Tucker).

As the series concluded, Carter McKay stayed put at WestStar, as powerful as ever; Michelle Stevens was left heartbroken and humiliated, alone in the ranch she had bought from McKay hoping to live there with James; Cliff Barnes was once and for all the sole owner of Ewing Oil, and Bobby Ewing, now owner of Southfork, was finally able to find closure after April&#x27;s death. J.R., however, having lost both Ewing Oil and Southfork, as well as being abandoned by his sons, was at the end of his rope; the series ended with the unanswered question whether or not he killed himself.

==Production==
===Seasons 1–8===
Series creator David Jacobs&#x27;s partner Michael Filerman suggested &quot;Dallas&quot; as the name for the show. Jacobs knew nothing about the city other than the Kennedy assassination and the Dallas Cowboys; only after visiting the state to prepare for filming did he realize that the show should be called &quot;Houston&quot; as the petroleum industry is much more important there, while Dallas has banking and insurance. He wrote the first and the final episode of the original five-part miniseries (season 1), with the other three episodes being written by Arthur Bernard Lewis, Camille Marchetta and Virginia Aldrige. While Aldrige did not return to the series again and Marchetta left during season 4, Lewis grew to be one of &quot;Dallas&#x27;s&quot; most influential writers.

Leonard Katzman had been a part of season 1 as producer, and during season 2 his influence increased, as he began writing and directing episodes. Series creator David Jacobs left his day-to-day duties as executive story consultant at the end of season 2, in order to focus on the production of spin-off &quot;Knots Landing&quot;. The executive producers of &quot;Dallas&quot; in the first 3 seasons were Philip Capice and Lee Rich. During the first 8 seasons of the show, &quot;Dallas&quot;″s production team remained basically intact (the main exception being Rich&#x27;s leaving after season 3). After Lee Rich&#x27;s departure, Philip Capice served as the sole executive producer, Leonard Katzman as producer and showrunner, Cliff Fenneman as associate producer, and Arthur Bernard Lewis as executive story editor/supervising producer. And, although 25 writers contributed with scripts, the trio of Katzman, Lewis and David Paulsen wrote nearly two-thirds of the episodes during these first eight seasons. Paulsen had joined the show during the season 4 and was promoted to story editor for season 6. Notably, the three of them wrote every episode but two during seasons 7 and 8.

===Season 9===
Creative conflicts between executive producer Philip Capice and producer Leonard Katzman led to Katzman leaving the show at the end of season 8. Although Katzman was to continue writing for the show during season 9 and also acted during this season as &quot;creative consultant&quot; (which meant he was sent copies of all scripts and asked to give his input), Capice decided to bring in a new production team: joining him and associate producer Cliff Fenneman were James H. Brown as producer and Peter Dunne as supervising producer/showrunner, executive story consultant Joel J. Feigenbaum, and story editors Hollace White and Stephanie Garman.

However, increased production costs and the claim of decreased ratings (though the accuracy of this has been disputed) caused production company Lorimar to persuade both Patrick Duffy and Leonard Katzman to return. As season 9 came to a close, Katzman was on board to return as showrunner for the following season and the season finale saw Patrick Duffy inexplicably resurface on screen.

===Season 10===
As of the season 10 premiere, there was another major overhaul of the crew, with Leonard Katzman not only returning to the production side of the show but also getting promoted to executive producer, reportedly on the condition that he would get &quot;total authority&quot; of the show, while Philip Capice and most of the season 9 staff left the production. Alongside Katzman, David Paulsen was brought back as the show&#x27;s new producer, while the position as supervising producer was offered to newcomer Calvin Clements Jr. and Cliff Fenneman remained associate producer. A new writing staff was hired to work alongside the producers, including Katzman&#x27;s son Mitchell Wayne Katzman as story editor and Leah Markus as story consultant. Markus left after two years, while the others remained until the show&#x27;s end.

Scriptwise, Patrick Duffy&#x27;s return was explained by having the entire season 9 being a dream of Victoria Principal&#x27;s character Pam, effectively sweeping away the events occurring during the period in which Katzman&#x27;s involvement with the show had been minimized.

Even the cast were affected by the production and political struggles. While Larry Hagman (J.R.) reportedly supported Katzman, and had played a great part in bringing Duffy back, Susan Howard (Donna), who also had written the script for one of the season 9 episodes, had sided with Philip Capice, and was opposed to the idea of annulling the events of season 9. While she returned to write another episode for season 10, she left the show, both as a writer and as a cast member, at the end of the season.

===Seasons 11–14===
During the final four years of the show, Leonard Katzman remained showrunner, with series star Larry Hagman joining him as executive producer (beginning with season 12) and Ken Horton as co-executive producer (as of season 13).

Supervising producer Calvin Clements Jr. left the show after season 10, and was replaced for seasons 11 and 12 by the returning Arthur Bernard Lewis, who remained a writer on the show until its end. Lewis was thus reuniting with Leonard Katzman and David Paulsen. However, Paulsen left &quot;Dallas&quot; at the end of the 11th season (to join rival soap &quot; Dynasty&quot;), and was replaced as the show&#x27;s producer first by Howard Lakin for season 12, and then by longtime associate producer Cliff Fenneman for the final two years. Lakin spent seasons 13 and 14 as supervising producer.

Mitchell Wayne Katzman was promoted to co-producer as of season 12, while Frank Katzman (the other son of Leonard Katzman) and John Rettino (Leonard Katzman&#x27;s son-in-law), served as associate producers during seasons 13 and 14. Additionally, Katzman&#x27;s PA Louella Lee Caraway was credited as executive coordinator for the final three seasons. The final major addition to the staff was Lisa Seidman, who joined the show as executive story consultant for the final two seasons.

===Filming locations===

The pilot season was shot entirely on location in Dallas, Texas, and at the Cloyce Box Ranch in Frisco, Texas. Later, most interiors for the show were shot at the MGM Studios in Culver City, California (which was purchased outright by Lorimar in 1986), with some exteriors being shot at the Southfork Ranch in Parker, Texas, and other sections of Dallas. For season 13, rising production costs led to all filming being relocated to California. Typically the cast and crew would spend six to eight weeks filming on-location sequences in the Dallas area during the summer prior to the season, then film the remainder of the season in the Los Angeles area; fewer than half of the episodes in a given season had on-location sequences filmed in Dallas. MGM built a full-size replica of the Southfork Ranch backyard and pool on one of its soundstages, allowing for filming of &quot;location&quot; shots during the latter part of the season.

===Directors===
Leonard Katzman is the most prominent director on the show, having directed episodes of every season except seasons 1, 9 and 12. Next to Katzman, Michael Preece, is responsible for having directed the most &quot;Dallas&quot; episodes, having joined the show during season 4 and remaining until the end. Of the two directors attached to the original miniseries, Robert Day did not return for subsequent seasons, while Irving J. Moore remained on the show until season 5, and then returned for the final three.

Five of the series&#x27; stars also directed episodes: Larry Hagman (seasons 3-14), Patrick Duffy (seasons 4-8 and 10-14), Linda Gray (seasons 9-12), Steve Kanaly (seasons 10-12) and Ken Kercheval (seasons 13-14).

==Episodes==


==Ratings==
&quot;Dallas&quot; originally aired on Saturday nights when it debuted as a regular series. Within a month, the show was moved to Sunday nights, where it stayed until halfway through the season, when it took a Friday-night slot. &quot;Dallas&quot; remained on Fridays until the show ended in 1991, alternating between 9p.m. and 10p.m. airings.

The &quot;Who Done It&quot; episode of &quot;Dallas&quot; that revealed who shot J.R.?, the famous 1980 cliffhanger, received the highest domestic ratings at that point with over 90 million American viewers (representing more than 53% of the U.S. households and 76% of the U.S. television audience for November 21, 1980) tuning in for the answer. The episode surpassed the ratings record of the final episode of &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, broadcast in August 1967, but the record of &quot;Dallas&quot; was broken only by the last episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in 1983, falling into the second internationally most watched U.S. television episode, with nearly 360 million viewers in over 57 countries worldwide (by the year 1980) tuning in to see who shot J.R.

Although the soap&#x27;s audience had consistently declined since the &quot;Who Done It&quot; episode of 1980, the series finale of &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Conundrum&quot;, garnered 33 million viewers and a 22 household rating from 9 to 11pm on May 3, 1991, becoming the country&#x27;s 14th most watched television series finale. Its competition, &quot;Manhunter&quot; (on NBC), only drew a 9.8 rating.

====Syndication====
Beginning in fall 1984, &quot;Dallas&quot; was packaged for off-network syndication by Lorimar to local stations; among the stations to purchase the program initially was the Dallas-Fort Worth ABC affiliate, WFAA-TV. Only the first 222 episodes (seasons 1 through 9) were part of the syndication package. However, &quot;Dallas&quot; did not achieve the same type of rating success in local markets as it did during its CBS primetime run.

During the 1990s, the show aired briefly on TNT (from September 1992 to August 1993, again the first nine seasons only), followed by a run on TNN beginning in the fall of 1996 (the first network to air all 357 episodes of the original series, but the episodes were heavily edited for time), and from 2003 to 2008 the entire run aired on the all-soaps cable network, SoapNet, uncut and unedited, as it was originally broadcast. On January 1, 2011, CMT aired the show for one day, and prior to the premiere of the 2012 sequel, select episodes were shown on CMT and its website.

In 1981, Mediaset, Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s Italian media conglomerate, translated and serialized &quot;Dallas&quot; on Italian primetime, where it became popular throughout Italy. 
====Broadcasts in the United Kingdom====
In the UK, the rights to show &quot;Dallas&quot; had been bought by the BBC and quickly became a ratings winner, drawing audiences of over 20 million. However, in 1985 the corporation refused to pay $60,000 per-episode asking price for the next (ninth) series. Whilst negotiating with the distributor to acquire the next season, their commercial rival, the ITV franchise holder Thames Television unexpectedly stepped in and met the price. The BBC reacted angrily to this development, pulling the current series mid-run, and threatening to broadcast the remaining episodes simultaneously with Thames Television&#x27;s intended scheduling in November of that year. It caused a furore in the press and a question on the matter was even asked at Westminster in Parliament. The BBC relented, and re-commenced their broadcasts of the current series on the 27th March Ultimately, numerous other ITV franchises in particular Granada Television and Yorkshire Television were not happy with the deal, and thus complained to the regulatory Independent Broadcasting Authority. After a few months pressure from the IBA and other ITV franchise holders resulted in Thames Television backing down on their plans, and sold season nine back to the BBC, at a loss. Which took until January 1986 to be resolved. &quot;Dallas&quot; continued to be broadcast on the BBC, being shown on BBC1 until the end of the series run until 1991.

==Cliffhangers==
&quot;Dallas&quot; is notable for its cliffhangers. Throughout the series&#x27; run, every season ended with some sort of cliffhanging ending designed to drive ratings up for the season premiere later in the year.

* Pilot Season/Season 1 cliffhanger: Although this really was not a cliffhanger, the end of the fifth episode of the original &quot;Dallas&quot; miniseries saw J.R. (Larry Hagman) go up to the loft of the barn to talk to Pam (Victoria Principal), who had gone up there to find her cousin Jimmy (James Canning), after Digger (David Wayne) had fallen off the wagon at the Ewing barbecue. J.R., intoxicated, tries to convince her to tell Bobby (Patrick Duffy) not to leave the ranch. However, she does not want to be bothered, and, in trying to escape J.R., she falls from the loft, landing square on her stomach. Pam, who is pregnant, miscarries her unborn child. Later, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) questions J.R. as to whether it was really an accident or did he mean for Pam to fall on purpose. J.R. says, &quot;I did not.&quot; When Sue Ellen asks J.R. if he cares that Pam lost the baby, J.R. does not answer her, leaving it up to the viewer to decide.
* Season 2 cliffhanger: Sue Ellen&#x27;s drinking problem has landed her in a sanitarium, where she is pregnant with a child she believes is Cliff&#x27;s (Ken Kercheval). She escapes from the sanitarium, gets drunk, and then gets into a severe car accident, putting her life and the baby&#x27;s life in danger. The doctors deliver the baby, named John Ross Ewing III, but he is very small on delivery and is not out of the woods yet; nor is Sue Ellen, who, as the episode ends, is clinging to life. A distraught J.R. is watching his wife at the end of the episode in tears, saying that she has &quot;just gotta live&quot;.
* Season 3 cliffhanger: J.R. has made so many people in Texas hate him with a passion: men he has cheated in business, women he has cheated in relationships, family members he has angered, and a Marilee Stone (Fern Fitzgerald), whose husband committed suicide after a particularly disastrous business deal. After all this, somebody waits outside J.R.&#x27;s Ewing Oil office late at night, and when J.R. hears a noise, asks who it is and walks to the door, somebody shoots him twice in the abdomen. The cliffhanger to this episode leads to the now-famous &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot; debates and speculation, and also speculation as to whether J.R. would actually survive the shooting or be killed off.
* Season 4 cliffhanger: Sue Ellen tries to sneak her son John Ross off Southfork, but is caught by J.R., who banishes her from the ranch. Pam later intercedes, taking John Ross to his mother while J.R. is away—throwing J.R. into a rage. Kristin (Mary Crosby) returns demanding more money from J.R., who tells her it is not too late to prosecute her for shooting him. While heading to a late-night business meeting with Bobby, Cliff finds a brunette woman&#x27;s body floating in the Southfork pool. He jumps into the pool to see who it is, and when he looks back up, J.R. is standing on the balcony over the pool. Believing J.R. is responsible, Cliff says to his rival, &quot;She&#x27;s dead. You bastard.&quot; The face of the body was not shown, leading to speculation over whether it was Sue Ellen, Pam, Kristin or someone else. This was the show&#x27;s highest-rated season-ending episode. 
* Season 5 cliffhanger: Earlier in the season, Cliff had J.R. facing a financial mess, when J.R.&#x27;s plan to blackmail the Farlows into handing over John Ross, by stockpiling 5 million barrels of the Farlows&#x27; crude oil, backfired on J.R., when the market price of crude oil started to plummet. In order to stockpile the Farlows&#x27; crude oil, J.R. had taken out a $200,000,000 loan and used $50,000,000 worth of Ewing Oil assets as collateral. Cliff, along with Jordan Lee (Don Starr), Andy Bradley (Paul Sorensen) and Wade Luce (Robert Ackerman), then worked with Vaughn Leland (Dennis Patrick) in order to buy into the notes owed by J.R., and they planned to foreclose. With Cliff seemingly putting one over on J.R., Miss Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes) bailed Ewing Oil out of this mess by agreeing to a deal with Clayton (Howard Keel) that Clayton would pay the price that he would have paid at the time that the oil was stockpiled. By the season&#x27;s end, J.R. and Cliff&#x27;s situations had turned sharply in the opposite direction, as Sue Ellen, with whom Cliff had had an off-and-on relationship, decided to return to J.R., planning to marry him again. In addition, J.R. had set a trap for Cliff by making sure that a fake geological report would convince Cliff to invest millions of dollars in buying property on supposedly oil rich land which was actually bone dry. Cliff was then fired by his mother Rebecca Barnes Wentworth (Priscilla Pointer) from running Wentworth Tool &amp; Die, due to Cliff&#x27;s embezzlement of company funds. Cliff attempts suicide with an overdose of pills, and a guilt-ridden Sue Ellen rushes to his bedside as Cliff lies in a coma. J.R. tries to convince Sue Ellen that it was not anybody&#x27;s fault but Cliff&#x27;s for what happened, but Sue Ellen disagrees and says she does not know if she can remarry J.R. if Cliff dies. Cliff&#x27;s life hangs in the balance as the season ends.
* Season 6 cliffhanger: Earlier in the season, Sue Ellen gets drunk after having seen J.R. in bed with Holly Harwood (Lois Chiles). She gets into a car and Ray Krebbs&#x27; (Steve Kanaly) cousin Mickey Trotter (Timothy Patrick Murphy) tries to stop her and they are involved in an accident, in a car belonging to J.R., just outside Southfork. Sue Ellen emerges with nothing worse than bruises, but Mickey is paralyzed from the neck down and in a coma. In the final episode of the season, Ray finds out that the driver of the other car was Walt Driscoll (Ben Piazza), who helped J.R. in a previous scheme. He also learns that Driscoll deliberately caused the accident, thinking that J.R. was driving, as a means of revenge for being put in jail by J.R. earlier in the year. An angered Ray comes to Southfork late at night demanding answers from J.R., who was not expecting to see him. J.R. asks him what is going on and Ray says he is going to kill J.R. for what happened. J.R. throws a candle holder at Ray, which misses him and knocks over another candle holder with lit candles in it. As the two brawl, the candles ignite a fire and the smoke starts to creep into both John Ross and Sue Ellen&#x27;s bedrooms as they sleep. Sue Ellen had been given a sedative by the doctor earlier in the day so she does not wake up. J.R. notices the fire and tries to break free of Ray, finally knocking him out with a telephone, and runs upstairs to try to save his wife and son. Ray recovers and runs after J.R. but is consumed by smoke and falls. J.R. is hit with a falling beam as he gets upstairs and both men are unconscious as Southfork burns.
* Season 7 cliffhanger: Reminiscent of the season three cliffhanger, a mysterious figure enters the Ewing Oil building late one night. Proceeding to J.R.&#x27;s office, the figure produces a gun and fires three shots into the back of J.R.&#x27;s chair in which somebody is sitting. As the victim falls out of the chair and to the ground, we see it is Bobby Ewing that has been shot.
* Season 8 cliffhanger: Bobby, who has been divorced from Pam for over a year and is now engaged to Jenna Wade (Priscilla Beaulieu Presley), decides that he wants to remarry his ex-wife instead, and Pam agrees. The next morning, as Bobby is leaving Pam&#x27;s house, someone drives a car at high speed toward Pam. Bobby shoves her out of the way just before she is hit but cannot get out of the way of the car in time to save himself. We see that it is Katherine (Morgan Brittany) who was driving the car, and that she was also killed when her car crashed after running over Bobby. Bobby is rushed to the hospital, where he later dies, with Pam, Jenna, J.R., Miss Ellie, Clayton, Ray and Donna (Susan Howard) at his bedside.
* Season 9 cliffhanger: Evil businesswoman Angelica Nero (Barbara Carrera) intends to kill J.R. and his cousin Jack (Dack Rambo) for double crossing her, but J.R. has her apprehended by the police. Unfortunately, Angelica has already had a bomb attached to Jack&#x27;s car, which explodes with Jamie (Jenilee Harrison) inside. After hearing this on the phone, J.R. runs out of his office to go to Jack&#x27;s apartment. As he leaves the office, Sue Ellen arrives in the other elevator looking for him. As soon as she enters J.R.&#x27;s office, another bomb left by Angelica goes off, and the entire floor that houses Ewing Oil explodes, showering debris onto the street below. The scene then shifts to Pam in bed, the day after her marriage to Mark Graison (John Beck). Pam wakes up to hear the shower running. Assuming it is Mark, she opens the shower door, only to find Bobby Ewing, alive and well. &quot;(In the Season Ten premiere, Bobby&#x27;s death and all of Season Nine was revealed as a dream of Pam&#x27;s).&quot;
* Season 10 cliffhanger: The Ewings suffer a devastating loss as Ewing Oil is closed down by the US Justice Department as punishment for J.R.&#x27;s shady dealings which caused an international incident. Pam, on her way home to Bobby from the doctor&#x27;s office after finding out she can finally conceive a baby, crashes into a fuel tanker, which then explodes.
* Season 11 cliffhanger: J.R. and Nicholas Pearce (Jack Scalia), Sue Ellen&#x27;s new boyfriend, fight in J.R.&#x27;s penthouse hotel suite. The fight ends up with both of them on the balcony, and Pearce falls over the balcony to his death. Shocked by what she has just seen, Sue Ellen then picks up a gun from the floor and shoots J.R. three times. She then picks up the phone and tells the police she would like to report a double murder.
* Season 12 cliffhanger: Sue Ellen prepares to leave Dallas for good, but with a final surprise for J.R.: with the help of her new boyfriend Don Lockwood (Ian McShane), Sue Ellen has made a biographical motion picture about her marriages to J.R. (with actors portraying them and the other Ewings) and previews the film to him, leaving him shocked and horrified. Sue Ellen tells J.R. that she is leaving Dallas, but if he ever crosses her again in the future – or even if she wakes up on the wrong side of bed one morning – she will release the film and J.R. will be made &quot;the laughing stock of Texas&quot;, before finally and triumphantly leaving.
* Season 13 cliffhanger: After deliberately committing himself into a sanitarium in order to persuade Clayton&#x27;s sister, Jessica Montford (Alexis Smith), to sign over her voting majority in WestStar Oil, J.R.&#x27;s plan backfires when Cally (Cathy Podewell) and James (Sasha Mitchell) coerce him into signing a property waiver before they will allow him to be released. Once he does, James tears up J.R.&#x27;s release papers anyway leaving him trapped in the sanitarium with no means of escape.
* Season 14 cliffhanger: After finally losing Ewing Oil to Cliff Barnes, control of Southfork to Bobby, and being abandoned by his wife and children, a drunk and despondent J.R. begins walking around the ranch alone with a loaded gun wishing he had never been born. A gunshot is later fired in J.R.&#x27;s bedroom as Bobby returns to Southfork, and he rushes up to J.R.&#x27;s room and gasps, saying &quot;Oh, my God!&quot; as the series ends.

==Spin-offs, sequels and adaptations==

===&quot;Knots Landing&quot;===

Prior to the premiere of &quot;Dallas&quot;, Jacobs originated the idea for a drama series about four married couples in different stages of marriage, inspired by Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;. However, CBS wanted a &quot;saga-like&quot; show, resulting in Jacobs creating &quot;Dallas&quot;. When the series proved to be a hit, CBS reconsidered Jacobs&#x27;s original idea, which evolved into &quot;Dallas&quot; spin-off series &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, premiering in late 1979.

&quot;Knots Landing&quot; followed the lives of Lucy&#x27;s parents, Gary (Ted Shackelford) and Valene (Joan Van Ark), as they move to California to start a new life following the start of their second marriage in 1979. During the early seasons of &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, several &quot;Dallas&quot; actors (Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Charlene Tilton, and Mary Crosby) made guest appearances in the new series, and Shackelford and Van Ark continued to make occasional appearances in &quot;Dallas&quot;. In addition to this, some storylines crossed over, such as the reading of Jock Ewing&#x27;s will, with events having an impact on characters in both shows.

The ongoing bond between the two series was eventually cut in 1986, as the tenth-season premiere of &quot;Dallas&quot; declared Bobby&#x27;s death the previous year had been a dream. Bobby&#x27;s death had had some influence on the &quot;Knots Landing&quot; storylines as well, with Gary grieving for his dead brother while Gary&#x27;s wife Abby (Donna Mills), who had lost her brother Sid (Don Murray) a few years earlier, consoled him. Abby and Greg Sumner (William Devane) then took advantage of Gary&#x27;s grief and Gary&#x27;s journey to Dallas for Bobby&#x27;s funeral to gain politically at Empire Valley. Val also named her and Gary&#x27;s son &quot;Bobby&quot; in memory of his late uncle. Unlike the &quot;Dallas&quot; producers, the &quot;Knots Landing&quot; producers were not prepared to reset their series, resulting in the producers cutting ties between the two shows. As a result, there were no further crossover episodes or storylines; Bobby&#x27;s return was simply never addressed on &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, nor was he mentioned again (ironically on &quot;Dallas&quot;, however, mentions of Gary increased, and archive footage of Joan Van Ark appeared in Season 12). However, Shackelford and Van Ark did reprise their roles for the &quot;Dallas&quot; series finale &quot;Conundrum&quot; in 1991, which showed what would have happened to their characters if J.R. had never existed.

Between Seasons 1 and 4 of &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, there were nine episodes where &quot;Dallas&quot; characters appeared, played by their respective actors.

;Season 1 (1979–80 season)

===Films and reunions===
A prequel story, &quot;&quot;, was a made-for-TV movie that first aired on March 23, 1986, on CBS during season 9 of the TV series. The movie starred David Grant as Digger Barnes, Dale Midkiff as Jock Ewing, Molly Hagan as Miss Ellie Southworth Ewing, David Wilson as Jason Ewing, and Hoyt Axton as Aaron Southworth, and was introduced by Larry Hagman in the role of J.R. Ewing. Detailing the origins of the Barnes-Ewing feud and the creation of Ewing Oil, and covering a timespan from 1933 to 1951, the movie was written by series creator David Jacobs.

There were also two made-for-TV reunion movies that aired on CBS several years after the series ended: &quot;&quot; (1996), which resolved the series finale cliffhanger; and the 20th anniversary movie &quot;&quot; (1998). Alongside returning series stars (Patrick Duffy, Larry Hagman, Linda Gray, George Kennedy, Ken Kercheval and Steve Kanaly), and recurring cast (Omri Katz, Audrey Landers, Deborah Rennard and George O. Petrie), the two telefilms also introduced new characters – most notably up-and-coming lawyer Anita Smithfield, played by Tracy Scoggins. The younger characters Christopher Ewing, and Cliff and Afton&#x27;s daughter Pamela Rebecca were recast with Chris Demetral and Deborah Kellner taking on the roles.

In November 2003, SOAPnet aired a &quot;Dallas&quot; reunion on Soap Talk to coincide with SOAPnet acquiring the rights to rerun Dallas episodes. Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray and Charlene Tilton all participated in the reunion, which included clips of past episodes. The SOAPnet Dallas reunion was included in the special features of Dallas Seasons 1 &amp; 2 DVD set.

On November 7, 2004, CBS aired a primetime TV special titled &quot;Dallas Reunion: The Return to Southfork&quot;, in which the stars reminisced about their work on the series (by coincidence, actor Howard Keel, who played Clayton Farlow, had died earlier that same day).

On November 8, 2008, a &quot;Dallas&quot; 30th anniversary reunion was held at Southfork Ranch in Parker, Texas, with original cast members Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Ken Kercheval, Steve Kanaly and Charlene Tilton; other cast members in attendance were Susan Howard, Audrey Landers, Mary Crosby and Sheree J. Wilson. The front and back lawn of the fictional Ewing family home played host to a massive barbecue filled with people from the Dallas area, across the U.S. and around the world (who paid as much as $1,000) to reminisce and celebrate the series, as well as meeting with cast members. During the festivities, Kercheval said he was shocked to see the continued support for the show 17 years after it last aired: &quot;I don&#x27;t understand it. The staying power. Who knew?&quot; Linda Gray also fondly remembered her time on the show: &quot;I think it was a special time. It was a time when there weren&#x27;t a hundred million channels and the Internet and all of the other things that came to existence.&quot;

&quot;A Dallas Retrospective: J.R. Ewing Bourbon Presents Linda Gray and Patrick Duffy&quot; one-night only event was held on March 23, 2017, at the AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center&#x27;s Winspear Opera House in Dallas, during which both Duffy and Gray reminisced about their careers and their time on &quot;Dallas&quot;. It was sponsored by the nationally distributed J.R. Ewing Bourbon and moderated by &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; columnist Robert Wilonsky.

On March 30–31, 2018, a 40th anniversary reunion was held at Southfork Ranch in Parker and the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, with cast members Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Charlene Tilton and Steve Kanaly attending the festivities. The celebrations included Southfork tours, a meet-and-greet with the cast, an array of &quot;Dallas&quot; memorabilia at the &quot;Dallas Legends&quot; exhibit and closing out with a party at the historic Longhorn Ballroom.

In honor of the show&#x27;s 45th anniversary, another reunion was held on June 13, 2023, at Oscar&#x27;s in Palm Springs, California which was attended by Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Steve Kanaly, Charlene Tilton, Audrey Landers and Joan Van Ark. The cast talked about the &quot;Dallas&quot; years as well as their personal lives and careers since with CBS moderator Sandie Newton.

===Revival series===
In 2010, cable network TNT announced they had ordered a pilot for the continuation of the &quot;Dallas&quot; series. After viewing the completed pilot episode, TNT proceeded to order a full season of 10 episodes.

The new series, which premiered on June 13, 2012, focused primarily on John Ross and Christopher Ewing, the now-grown sons of J.R. and Bobby. Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy and Linda Gray returned in full-time capacity, reprising their original roles. The series was produced by Warner Horizon Television, a subsidiary of Warner Bros., which holds the rights to the &quot;Dallas&quot; franchise through its acquisition of Lorimar Television and is a sister company to TNT, both under the ownership of Time Warner.

The new series is a continuation of the old series, with the story continuing after a 20-year break. It does not take the events of the 1990s TV movies &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot; as canon. Instead we find the characters 20 years after the events of the Season 14 cliffhanger. In an interview with UltimateDallas.com, writer/producer Cynthia Cidre was asked to describe the new &quot;Dallas&quot;. She responded, &quot;I tried to be really, really respectful of the original Dallas because it was really clear to me that the people who love Dallas are [like] Trekkies, really committed to that show and I really did not understand that before, so I never wanted to violate anything that had happened in the past. On the other hand that was the past, twenty years had gone by, so at the same time I think we&#x27;re properly balanced between the characters of Bobby Ewing, J.R. and Sue Ellen. I also have the new cast and it&#x27;s John Ross and Christopher, the children of Bobby and J.R., and their love interests. Total respect and a balance of old and new.&quot;

In the show&#x27;s second season, J.R. Ewing was killed off (following the death of actor Larry Hagman in November 2012), sparking another &quot;who-done-it&quot; storyline throughout the remainder of the season. Various cast members from the original series attended his onscreen funeral.

Despite initially strong numbers, ratings for the new &quot;Dallas&quot; declined over the three seasons that the show ran before TNT cancelled it in 2014.

===Books and other media===
During the series&#x27; heyday, several magazines, books and merchandise were produced:

*In 1980, a novel titled &quot;Dallas&quot; based on the original five-episode miniseries written by Lee Raintree was published by Dell Publishing.

It contains synopses for each season, extensive research into production and interviews with most of original cast, along with a foreword by Victoria Principal and an introduction by David Jacobs.

==Inspiration==
The 1956 film &quot;Giant&quot; is considered to be the inspiration for &quot;Dallas&quot;. Both productions focus on the struggle between wealthy oilmen and cattlemen in Texas, in the mid to late 20th century. In addition, both productions have a lead character prominently referred to as &quot;J.R.&quot;

==Legacy==
===&quot;Dallas&quot; and the Cold War===
&quot;Dallas&quot; is alleged to have helped partially hasten the downfall of the communist regime in the Eastern Bloc country of Romania during the final years of the Cold War. Romanian President Nicolae Ceaușescu allowed airings of &quot;Dallas&quot;, one of the few Western shows allowed to be aired in the Communist state during the 1980s. The belief that the show would be seen as anti-capitalistic backfired on the regime as Romanian citizens desired and sought the luxurious lifestyle of the American elite seen in the show, compared to the despotic situation in Romania at the time. Shortly after the execution of Ceaușescu and his wife on Christmas Day 1989, the pilot episode of &quot;Dallas&quot;, which had been edited for a sex scene, was one of the first Western Shows aired on the newly liberated Romanian TV. The popularity of &quot;Dallas&quot; in Romania is the subject of the 2016 experimental documentary &quot;Hotel Dallas&quot;, directed by artist duo Ungur &amp; Huang and starring Patrick Duffy, who plays a surreal double of the Bobby Ewing character.

Also in northern parts of Soviet-occupied Estonia, &quot;Dallas&quot; became popular when shown on Finnish television, being watched illegally on modified Soviet television sets. In the communist Soviet Union thousands of people drove regularly to the northern tip of Estonia to pick up the series on Finnish TV. This was described in the 2009 documentary &quot;Disco and Atomic War&quot;.

===Other===
In 2007, British comedian Justin Lee Collins went searching for all the stars of &quot;Dallas&quot; to bring them together for a special reunion party. The show was broadcast at 9p.m. Sunday, May 27, 2007, on UK television network Channel 4 as part of the &quot;Bring Back...&quot; series. After hunting down most of the main cast by any means necessary (e.g., climbing over security fences and ambushing hotels), Collins interviewed them and gained more knowledge about some of the decisions made throughout the show&#x27;s seasons. Amongst the cast, the participants were Larry Hagman, Linda Gray, Patrick Duffy, Ken Kercheval, Charlene Tilton, Susan Howard and Mary Crosby. Justin Lee Collins held his own &#x27;Oil Baron&#x27;s Ball&#x27;, where none of the main cast turned up! However, the actor who played baby Christopher (Eric Farlow) did attend. In an interview in 2011 Charlene Tilton said that show was one of her and the cast&#x27;s worst experiences ever.

In March 2011, the Texas Theatre in Dallas began showing two episodes of &quot;Dallas&quot; on the big screen every Sunday; over 100 patrons, some in costume of their favorite characters, appeared at the free screenings every week. However, the screenings came to an abrupt end in May 2011 after Warner Bros. issued a cease-and-desist against the Texas Theatre for unauthorized showings, citing the fact that those that were involved in the show&#x27;s production were not getting paid or benefiting from these screenings.

J.R. Ewing&#x27;s hat, a foremost symbol of the show&#x27;s inherent &quot;Americanness&quot; that contributed to its hold over audiences on a global scale, is currently held in the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History&#x27;s collections. 

In a popular &quot;Forbidden Broadway&quot; parody, an actress playing Mary Martin sings the song &quot;Never Never Panned&quot; to the tune of &quot;Never Never Land&quot; from the musical &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. One of the lines sung is &quot;you too can be a star, like my son who plays J.R. on &quot;Dallas&quot;! We&#x27;re never never panned!&quot;

The series is mentioned in the lyrics of Swedish pop band ABBA&#x27;s 1982 single &quot;The Day Before You Came&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s not, I think, a single episode of &quot;Dallas&quot; that I didn&#x27;t see.&quot;

Country singer Hank Williams Jr. had a hit with a song called &quot;This Ain&#x27;t Dallas&quot; comparing his and his wife&#x27;s life together with that of J.R. and Sue Ellen.

The show&#x27;s &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot; storyline has been used to great effect in other drama series, most notably the BBC&#x27;s &quot;EastEnders&quot; with the &quot;Who Shot Phil?&quot; Mitchell storyline, and more recently with the &quot;Who Killed Lucy Beale?&quot; storyline. In 1995, the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; also had a &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot; storyline.

In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;Dallas&quot; at No. 47 on its list of the 60 Best Series of all time.

<text>Agatharchides or Agatharchus ( or , &quot;Agatharchos&quot;) of Cnidus was a Greek historian and geographer (flourished 2nd century BC).

==Life==
Agatharchides is believed to have been born at Cnidus, hence his appellation. As Stanley M. Burstein notes, the &quot;evidence for Agatharchides&#x27; life is meagre.&quot; Photius describes him as a &quot;threptos&quot;, a kind of assistant of servile origin, to Cinnaeus and states that he was later a secretary to Heraclides Lembus. Cinnaeus served as a counselor to Ptolemy VI; Heraclides is best known for negotiating the treaty that ended Antiochus IV&#x27;s invasion of Egypt in 169 BC.

Agatharchides furnishes few clues about his own life. At the conclusion of his &quot;On the Erythraean Sea&quot;, he apologizes for being unable to complete his work &quot;since our age is unable to similarly bear the toil&quot; and &quot;as a result of the disturbances in Egypt&quot; he could no longer access the official records (a fragment cited by Photius in his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; Cod. 250.110, 460b). There are two possible occasions when this could have happened: the first was in 145 BC, when Ptolemy VIII purged Alexandria of the intellectuals who supported his rivals for the throne; and in 132 BC after Ptolemy, who had been driven from his kingdom by a rebellion in Alexandria, returned and exacted reprisals on that city. While most scholars have favored the later date, Burstein argues for the earlier one.

Extracts from the first book of his &quot;Erythraean Sea&quot;, written in the first person and advocating a military campaign into the lands south of Egypt, led early scholars to deduce that Agatharchides was an important political figure of his time, and served as a guardian to one of the sons of Ptolemy VIII. Dodwell endeavored to show that it the younger son, Alexander, and objects to Soter, that he reigned conjointly with his mother. This, however, was the case with Alexander likewise. Wesseling and Henry Fynes Clinton think the elder brother to be the one meant, for Soter was more likely to have been a minor on his accession in 117 BC than Alexander in 107 BC, ten years after their father&#x27;s death; the second edition of the &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot; article on Agatharchides agrees that the son was Soter. Moreover, Dodwell&#x27;s date would leave too short an interval between the publication of Agatharchides&#x27;s work on the Erythraean Sea (about 113 BC), and the work of Artemidorus. However at least as early as 1810, when B. G. Niebuhr pointed out that these excerpts were from a speech, and not part of the narrative of his book, this theory has been recognized as conflicting with other known historical facts.

==Writings==
Agatharchides was not well known in ancient times. Of his two major works, &quot;Affairs in Asia&quot; (&quot;Ta kata ten Asian&quot;) in ten books, and &quot;Affairs in Europe&quot; (&quot;Ta kata ten Europen&quot;) in forty-nine books, only a few fragments survive, too few to provide us with any sense of the contents of either work. However, for his &quot;On the Erythraean Sea&quot; (&quot;Peri tes Erythras Thalasses&quot; or &quot;De Mari Erythraeo&quot;) in five books, almost the entire fifth book, a geographical treatise on the Horn of Africa and the lands around the Red Sea, has survived almost intact. According to Burstein, &quot;the comparative soberness of Agatharchides&#x27; treatment compared to previous accounts and the wealth of information contained in it led to a quick recognition . . . [that it was] a valuable summary of the results of Ptolemaic exploration.&quot;

In the first book of &quot;On the Erythraean Sea&quot; was a discussion respecting the origin of the name. In the fifth Agatharchides described the mode of life amongst the Sabaeans in Arabia, and the Ichthyophagi, or fish-eaters, the way in which elephants were caught by the elephant-eaters, and the mode of working the gold mines in the mountains of Egypt, near the Red Sea. His account of the Ichthyophagi and of the mode of working the gold mines, has been copied by Diodorus (iii.12-18). Amongst other extraordinary animals he mentions the camelopard, which was found in the country of the Troglodytae, and the rhinoceros.

Material from this book is quoted directly or indirectly by Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Pliny the Elder, Aelian (Claudius Aelianus), Josephus and other authors. Although Agatharchides&#x27; work was superseded by more detailed accounts in the 2nd century AD, Photius found a copy of &quot;Erythraean Sea&quot; in the 9th century, from which he preserved extensive extracts in his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;. Photius states that Agatharchides wrote in the Attic dialect, with a style that was dignified and perspicuous, and abounded in sententious passages—inspiring a favorable opinion from Photius. In the composition of his speeches Agatharchides was an imitator of Thucydides, whom he equalled in dignity and excelled in clearness. He was acquainted with the language of the Aethiopians (&quot;de Rubr. M.&quot; p. 46), and appears to have been the first who discovered the true cause of the yearly inundations of the Nile. (Diod. i. 41.)

An Agatharchides, of Samos, is mentioned by Plutarch, as the author of a work on Persia, and one περὶ λίθων. J.A. Fabricius, however, conjectures that the true reading is Agathyrsides, not Agatharchides. (Dodwell in Hudson&#x27;s &quot;Geogr. Script. Gr. Minores&quot;; Clinton, &quot;Fasti Hell.&quot; iii, p. 535.)

<text>Wayford Bridge is a village on the River Ant on the A149 road, near Stalham in Norfolk, England within The Broads National Park.

Due to height restrictions under the road bridge it is the most northerly point of navigation on the Norfolk Broads for boats over in height above the water line. Broads boats can continue to Dilham, though the channel is narrow and has limited places in which to turn around. Wayford Bridge is the southern end of the North Walsham and Dilham Canal.

<doc id="99438" wikidata="Q1362750" url="?curid=99438" title="Extended Euclidean algorithm">
<text>In arithmetic and computer programming, the extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the Euclidean algorithm, and computes, in addition to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, also the coefficients of Bézout&#x27;s identity, which are integers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; such that
: formula_1
This is a certifying algorithm, because the gcd is the only number that can simultaneously satisfy this equation and divide the inputs.
It allows one to compute also, with almost no extra cost, the quotients of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; by their greatest common divisor.

 also refers to a very similar algorithm for computing the polynomial greatest common divisor and the coefficients of Bézout&#x27;s identity of two univariate polynomials.

The extended Euclidean algorithm is particularly useful when &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are coprime. With that provision, &quot;x&quot; is the modular multiplicative inverse of &quot;a&quot; modulo &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;y&quot; is the modular multiplicative inverse of &quot;b&quot; modulo &quot;a&quot;. Similarly, the polynomial extended Euclidean algorithm allows one to compute the multiplicative inverse in algebraic field extensions and, in particular in finite fields of non prime order. It follows that both extended Euclidean algorithms are widely used in cryptography. In particular, the computation of the modular multiplicative inverse is an essential step in the derivation of key-pairs in the RSA public-key encryption method.

== Description==
The standard Euclidean algorithm proceeds by a succession of Euclidean divisions whose quotients are not used. Only the &quot;remainders&quot; are kept. For the extended algorithm, the successive quotients are used. More precisely, the standard Euclidean algorithm with &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; as input, consists of computing a sequence formula_2 of quotients and a sequence formula_3 of remainders such that 
:formula_4
It is the main property of Euclidean division that the inequalities on the right define uniquely formula_5 and formula_6 from formula_7 and formula_8

The computation stops when one reaches a remainder formula_9 which is zero; the greatest common divisor is then the last non zero remainder formula_10

The extended Euclidean algorithm proceeds similarly, but adds two other sequences, as follows

:formula_11

The computation also stops when formula_12 and gives 
*formula_13 is the greatest common divisor of the input formula_14 and formula_15
* The Bézout coefficients are formula_16 and formula_17 that is formula_18
* The quotients of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; by their greatest common divisor are given by formula_19 and formula_20

Moreover, if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are both positive and formula_21, then 
:formula_22
for formula_23 where formula_24 denotes the integral part of , that is the greatest integer not greater than .

This implies that the pair of Bézout&#x27;s coefficients provided by the extended Euclidean algorithm is the &quot;minimal pair&quot; of Bézout coefficients, as being the unique pair satisfying both above inequalities.

Also it means that the algorithm can be done without integer overflow by a computer program using integers of a fixed size that is larger than that of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

=== Example ===

The following table shows how the extended Euclidean algorithm proceeds with input and . The greatest common divisor is the last non zero entry, in the column &quot;remainder&quot;. The computation stops at row 6, because the remainder in it is . Bézout coefficients appear in the last two columns of the second-to-last row. In fact, it is easy to verify that . Finally the last two entries and of the last row are, up to the sign, the quotients of the input and by the greatest common divisor .

=== Proof ===
As formula_25 the sequence of the formula_26 is a decreasing sequence of nonnegative integers (from &quot;i&quot; = 2 on). Thus it must stop with some formula_27 This proves that the algorithm stops eventually.

As formula_28 the greatest common divisor is the same for formula_29 and formula_30 This shows that the greatest common divisor of the input formula_31 is the same as that of formula_32 This proves that formula_33 is the greatest common divisor of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. (Until this point, the proof is the same as that of the classical Euclidean algorithm.)

As formula_34 and formula_35 we have formula_36 for &quot;i&quot; = 0 and 1. The relation follows by induction for all formula_37:
formula_38

Thus formula_16 and formula_40 are Bézout coefficients.

Consider the matrix
formula_41

The recurrence relation may be rewritten in matrix form
formula_42

The matrix formula_43 is the identity matrix and its determinant is one. The determinant of the rightmost matrix in the preceding formula is −1. It follows that the determinant of formula_44 is formula_45 In particular, for formula_46 we have formula_47 Viewing this as a Bézout&#x27;s identity, this shows that formula_48 and formula_49 are coprime. The relation formula_50 that has been proved above and Euclid&#x27;s lemma show that formula_48 divides , that is that formula_52 for some integer . Dividing by formula_48 the relation formula_50 gives formula_55 So, formula_48 and formula_57 are coprime integers that are the quotients of and by a common factor, which is thus their greatest common divisor or its opposite.

To prove the last assertion, assume that &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are both positive and formula_21. Then, formula_59, and if formula_60, it can be seen that the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; sequences for (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) under the EEA are, up to initial 0s and 1s, the &quot;t&quot; and &quot;s&quot; sequences for (&quot;b&quot;,&quot;a&quot;). The definitions then show that the (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) case reduces to the (&quot;b&quot;,&quot;a&quot;) case. So assume that formula_61 without loss of generality.

It can be seen that formula_62 is 1 and formula_63 (which exists by formula_21) is a negative integer. Thereafter, the formula_65 alternate in sign and strictly increase in magnitude, which follows inductively from the definitions and the fact that formula_66 for formula_67, the case formula_68 holds because formula_61. The same is true for the formula_70 after the first few terms, for the same reason. Furthermore, it is easy to see that formula_71 (when &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are both positive and formula_21). Thus, noticing that formula_73, we obtain
formula_74

This, accompanied by the fact that formula_75 are larger than or equal to in absolute value than any previous formula_65 or formula_70 respectively completed the proof.

== Polynomial extended Euclidean algorithm ==
For univariate polynomials with coefficients in a field, everything works similarly, Euclidean division, Bézout&#x27;s identity and extended Euclidean algorithm. The first difference is that, in the Euclidean division and the algorithm, the inequality formula_78 has to be replaced by an inequality on the degrees formula_79 Otherwise, everything which precedes in this article remains the same, simply by replacing integers by polynomials.

A second difference lies in the bound on the size of the Bézout coefficients provided by the extended Euclidean algorithm, which is more accurate in the polynomial case, leading to the following theorem.

&quot;If a and b are two nonzero polynomials, then the extended Euclidean algorithm produces the unique pair of polynomials&quot; (&quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) &quot;such that&quot;
:formula_80
&quot;and&quot;
:formula_81

A third difference is that, in the polynomial case, the greatest common divisor is defined only up to the multiplication by a non zero constant. There are several ways to define unambiguously a greatest common divisor.

In mathematics, it is common to require that the greatest common divisor be a monic polynomial. To get this, it suffices to divide every element of the output by the leading coefficient of formula_10 This allows that, if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are coprime, one gets 1 in the right-hand side of Bézout&#x27;s inequality. Otherwise, one may get any non-zero constant. In computer algebra, the polynomials commonly have integer coefficients, and this way of normalizing the greatest common divisor introduces too many fractions to be convenient.

The second way to normalize the greatest common divisor in the case of polynomials with integer coefficients is to divide every output by the content of formula_83 to get a primitive greatest common divisor. If the input polynomials are coprime, this normalisation also provides a greatest common divisor equal to 1. The drawback of this approach is that a lot of fractions should be computed and simplified during the computation.

A third approach consists in extending the algorithm of subresultant pseudo-remainder sequences in a way that is similar to the extension of the Euclidean algorithm to the extended Euclidean algorithm. This allows that, when starting with polynomials with integer coefficients, all polynomials that are computed have integer coefficients. Moreover, every computed remainder formula_84 is a subresultant polynomial. In particular, if the input polynomials are coprime, then the Bézout&#x27;s identity becomes 
:formula_85
where formula_86 denotes the resultant of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. In this form of Bézout&#x27;s identity, there is no denominator in the formula. If one divides everything by the resultant one gets the classical Bézout&#x27;s identity, with an explicit common denominator for the rational numbers that appear in it.

== Pseudocode==
To implement the algorithm that is described above, one should first remark that only the two last values of the indexed variables are needed at each step. Thus, for saving memory, each indexed variable must be replaced by just two variables.

For simplicity, the following algorithm (and the other algorithms in this article) uses parallel assignments. In a programming language which does not have this feature, the parallel assignments need to be simulated with an auxiliary variable. For example, the first one,
 (old_r, r) := (r, old_r - quotient * r)
is equivalent to
 prov := r;
 r := old_r - quotient × prov;
 old_r := prov;
and similarly for the other parallel assignments.
This leads to the following code:

 function extended_gcd(a, b)
 (old_r, r) := (a, b)
 (old_s, s) := (1, 0)
 (old_t, t) := (0, 1)
 while r ≠ 0 do
 quotient := old_r div r
 (old_r, r) := (r, old_r − quotient × r)
 (old_s, s) := (s, old_s − quotient × s)
 (old_t, t) := (t, old_t − quotient × t)
 output &quot;Bézout coefficients:&quot;, (old_s, old_t)
 output &quot;greatest common divisor:&quot;, old_r
 output &quot;quotients by the gcd:&quot;, (t, s)

The quotients of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; by their greatest common divisor, which is output, may have an incorrect sign. This is easy to correct at the end of the computation but has not been done here for simplifying the code. Similarly, if either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; is zero and the other is negative, the greatest common divisor that is output is negative, and all the signs of the output must be changed.

Finally, notice that in Bézout&#x27;s identity, formula_87, one can solve for formula_88 given formula_89. Thus, an optimization to the above algorithm is to compute only the formula_16 sequence (which yields the Bézout coefficient formula_91), and then compute formula_88 at the end:

 function extended_gcd(a, b)
 s := 0; old_s := 1
 r := b; old_r := a
 while r ≠ 0 do
 quotient := old_r div r
 (old_r, r) := (r, old_r − quotient × r)
 (old_s, s) := (s, old_s − quotient × s)
 if b ≠ 0 then
 bezout_t := (old_r − old_s × a) div b
 else
 bezout_t := 0
 output &quot;Bézout coefficients:&quot;, (old_s, bezout_t)
 output &quot;greatest common divisor:&quot;, old_r

However, in many cases this is not really an optimization: whereas the former algorithm is not susceptible to overflow when used with machine integers (that is, integers with a fixed upper bound of digits), the multiplication of &quot;old_s * a&quot; in computation of &quot;bezout_t&quot; can overflow, limiting this optimization to inputs which can be represented in less than half the maximal size. When using integers of unbounded size, the time needed for multiplication and division grows quadratically with the size of the integers. This implies that the &quot;optimisation&quot; replaces a sequence of multiplications/divisions of small integers by a single multiplication/division, which requires more computing time than the operations that it replaces, taken together.

==Simplification of fractions==
A fraction is in canonical simplified form if and are coprime and is positive. This canonical simplified form can be obtained by replacing the three output lines of the preceding pseudo code by 
 if then output &quot;Division by zero&quot;
 if then ; (&quot;for avoiding negative denominators&quot;)
 if then output (&quot;for avoiding denominators equal to&quot; 1)
 output 

The proof of this algorithm relies on the fact that and are two coprime integers such that , and thus formula_93. To get the canonical simplified form, it suffices to move the minus sign for having a positive denominator.

If divides evenly, the algorithm executes only one iteration, and we have at the end of the algorithm. It is the only case where the output is an integer.

==Computing multiplicative inverses in modular structures==

The extended Euclidean algorithm is the essential tool for computing multiplicative inverses in modular structures, typically the modular integers and the algebraic field extensions. A notable instance of the latter case are the finite fields of non-prime order.

===Modular integers===

If is a positive integer, the ring may be identified with the set of the remainders of Euclidean division by , the addition and the multiplication consisting in taking the remainder by of the result of the addition and the multiplication of integers. An element of has a multiplicative inverse (that is, it is a unit) if it is coprime to . In particular, if is prime, has a multiplicative inverse if it is not zero (modulo ). Thus is a field if and only if is prime.

Bézout&#x27;s identity asserts that and are coprime if and only if there exist integers and such that 
:formula_94
Reducing this identity modulo gives 
:formula_95
Thus , or, more exactly, the remainder of the division of by , is the multiplicative inverse of modulo .

To adapt the extended Euclidean algorithm to this problem, one should remark that the Bézout coefficient of is not needed, and thus does not need to be computed. Also, for getting a result which is positive and lower than &quot;n&quot;, one may use the fact that the integer provided by the algorithm satisfies . That is, if , one must add to it at the end. This results in the pseudocode, in which the input &quot;n&quot; is an integer larger than 1.
 function inverse(a, n)
 t := 0; newt := 1
 r := n; newr := a
 while newr ≠ 0 do
 quotient := r div newr
 (t, newt) := (newt, t − quotient × newt) 
 (r, newr) := (newr, r − quotient × newr)
 if r &gt; 1 then
 return &quot;a is not invertible&quot;
 if t &lt; 0 then
 t := t + n
 return t

=== Simple algebraic field extensions ===

The extended Euclidean algorithm is also the main tool for computing multiplicative inverses in simple algebraic field extensions. An important case, widely used in cryptography and coding theory, is that of finite fields of non-prime order. In fact, if is a prime number, and , the field of order is a simple algebraic extension of the prime field of elements, generated by a root of an irreducible polynomial of degree .

A simple algebraic extension of a field , generated by the root of an irreducible polynomial of degree may be identified to the quotient ring formula_96, and its elements are in bijective correspondence with the polynomials of degree less than . The addition in is the addition of polynomials. The multiplication in is the remainder of the Euclidean division by of the product of polynomials. Thus, to complete the arithmetic in , it remains only to define how to compute multiplicative inverses. This is done by the extended Euclidean algorithm.

The algorithm is very similar to that provided above for computing the modular multiplicative inverse. There are two main differences: firstly the last but one line is not needed, because the Bézout coefficient that is provided always has a degree less than . Secondly, the greatest common divisor which is provided, when the input polynomials are coprime, may be any non zero elements of ; this Bézout coefficient (a polynomial generally of positive degree) has thus to be multiplied by the inverse of this element of . In the pseudocode which follows, is a polynomial of degree greater than one, and is a polynomial. 

 function inverse(a, p)
 t := 0; newt := 1
 r := p; newr := a
 while newr ≠ 0 do
 quotient := r div newr
 (r, newr) := (newr, r − quotient × newr)
 (t, newt) := (newt, t − quotient × newt)
 if degree(r) &gt; 0 then 
 return &quot;Either p is not irreducible or a is a multiple of p&quot;
 return (1/r) × t

====Example====

For example, if the polynomial used to define the finite field GF(28) is , and is the element whose inverse is desired, then performing the algorithm results in the computation described in the following table. Let us recall that in fields of order 2&quot;n&quot;, one has −&quot;z&quot; = &quot;z&quot; and &quot;z&quot; + &quot;z&quot; = 0 for every element &quot;z&quot; in the field). Since 1 is the only nonzero element of GF(2), the adjustment in the last line of the pseudocode is not needed.
Thus, the inverse is , as can be confirmed by multiplying the two elements together, and taking the remainder by of the result.

==The case of more than two numbers ==
One can handle the case of more than two numbers iteratively. First we show that formula_97. To prove this let formula_98. By definition of gcd formula_99 is a divisor of formula_100 and formula_101. Thus formula_102 for some formula_103. Similarly formula_99 is a divisor of formula_105 so formula_106 for some formula_107. Let formula_108. By our construction of formula_109, formula_110 but since formula_99 is the greatest divisor formula_109 is a unit. And since formula_113 the result is proven.

So if formula_114 then there are formula_91 and formula_88 such that formula_117 so the final equation will be

: formula_118

So then to apply to &quot;n&quot; numbers we use induction

:formula_119

with the equations following directly.

<text>Coltishall is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk.

Coltishall is located on the River Bure and within the Norfolk Broads, north-west of Wroxham and north-east of Norwich.

==Etymology==
Coltishall&#x27;s name is of Old English origin and first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the forms &quot;Cokereshala&quot; and &quot;Coketeshala&quot;. From 1200 onwards, it is attested in the contracted form &quot;Couteshal(e)&quot;, in which form it has more or less remained to the present day (the &quot;l&quot; in the modern spelling is due to hypercorrection). The second part of the name is thought to derive from the Old English word &quot;halh&quot; (&#x27;nook&#x27;) but the origin of the first part is uncertain; one guess is that it was an otherwise unattested personal name &quot;Coccede&quot; or &quot;Cohhede&quot;, and thus meant &#x27;Coccede&#x27;s nook&#x27;. But &quot;The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names&quot; concludes that &quot;the recorded forms are too few and contradictory for satisfactory explanation&quot;.

==History==
In the Domesday Book, Coltishall is recorded as a settlement of 16 households in the hundred of South Erpingham. In 1086, the village was divided between the estates of William de Warenne and Roger de Poitou.

In 1231, Coltishall was made a &#x27;free-town&#x27; by King Henry III. 

Furthermore, from the mid-Eighteenth Century, Coltishall was a centre for the malting industry with many wherries being built in the village.

In the late-Eighteenth Century, parts of the Bure Navigational Canal were dug in the parish to make the River Bure more easily navigable for watercraft.

In 1939, RAF Coltishall was opened as a base for the Hawker Hurricanes of No. 242 Squadron RAF, with the famous fighter ace Douglas Bader being based in Coltishall during the Second World War. RAF Coltishall continue to be used by the Royal Air Force until its closure in November 2006 following a Ministry of Defence review. The site is today operated as HM Prison Bure, which houses male prisoners convicted of sex offences.

Horstead Watermill, close to the village, was one of the most photographed mills in Britain until it burned down in 1963.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census, Coltishall has a population of 1,446 people which shows a decrease from the 1,503 people recorded in the 2011 census.

Coltishall is located on the River Bure and within the Norfolk Broads. The village is also located at the junction of the B1150, between Norwich and North Walsham, and the B1354, between Thursford and Hoveton.

==Church of St. John the Baptist==
Coltishall&#x27;s parish churches is dedicated John the Baptist and dates at its earliest to the Fifteenth Century. St. John&#x27;s is located on Church Street and has been Grade I listed since 1984.

The church was largely re-built in 1865 and boasts a Twelfth Century font made from Purbeck Marble. In addition, there is a good collection of stained-glass windows including some from the workshops of James Powell and Sons (depicting the Risen Christ) and memorial glass by Alfred Wilkinson.

Within the parish there is a ruined church dedicated to Saint Theobald of Provins which was built in the Eleventh Century and was abandoned in the Nineteenth Century.

==Notable Residents==
*Reverend John Alen- (1476-1534) priest and church lawyer, born in Coltishall.
*Sir John Alan- (1500-1561) statesman and Irish Lord Chancellor, born in Coltishall.
*Doctor John Smith- (1711-1795) academic and astronomer, born in Coltishall.
*Thomas Holloway- (1748-1827) painter and engraver, lived &amp; died in Coltishall.
*Chaplain William Addison VC- (1883-1962) Church of England priest and army chaplain, Rector of Coltishall from 1938-1958.
*Gwyneth Johnstone- (1915-2010) painter, born &amp; died in Coltishall.
*Robin Huggins- (b.1947) Norfolk cricketer, born in Coltishall.

==Climate==
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen climate classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

== Governance ==
Coltishall is an electoral ward for local elections and is part of the district of Broadland.

The village&#x27;s national constituency is Broadland and Fakenham which has been represented by the Conservative Party&#x27;s Jerome Mayhew MP since 2019.

== War Memorial ==
Coltishall&#x27;s war memorial is a stone cross on the High Street which is shared with the nearby village of Great Hautbois. The memorial was unveiled in August of 1920 and lists the following names for the First World War:

And, the following for the Second World War:

<text>The 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair (also known as the 1964–1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair) was an international exposition at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York City, United States. The fair included exhibitions, activities, performances, films, art, and food presented by 80 nations, 24 U.S. states, and nearly 350 American companies. The five sections of the fairground were the Federal and State, International, Transportation, Lake Amusement, and Industrial areas. The fair&#x27;s theme was &quot;Peace through Understanding&quot;, and its symbol was the Unisphere, a stainless-steel model of Earth. Initially, the fair had 139 pavilions, and 34 concessions and shows.

The site had previously hosted the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. In the 1950s, several businessmen devised plans for a similar event in 1964, and the New York World&#x27;s Fair 1964 Corporation (WFC) was formed in 1959. Although U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower approved the fair, the Bureau International des Expositions refused to grant it formal recognition. Construction began in late 1960, and over 100 exhibitors signed up for the fair over the next three years. The fair ran for two six-month seasons from April 22 to October 18, 1964, and from April 21 to October 17, 1965. Despite initial projections of 70 million visitors, just over 51.6 million attended. After the fair closed, some pavilions were preserved or relocated, but most of the structures were demolished.

The fair showcased mid-20th-century American culture and technology. The sections were designed in various architectural styles. Anyone could host an exhibit if they could afford to rent the land and pay for a pavilion. There were several amusement and transport rides, various plazas and fountains, and at its peak, 198 restaurants that served dishes such as Belgian waffles, some of which were popularized by the fair. There were more than 30 entertainment events, 40 theaters, and various music performances. Exhibitors displayed sculptures, visual art and artifacts, and consumer products such as electronics and cars. The contemporaneous press criticized the event as a financial failure, although it influenced 21st-century technologies, and popularized consumer products such as the Ford Mustang.

== Development ==
Before European settlement of the area, the site of the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair, Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York City, was a natural wetland straddling the Flushing River. In the early 20th century, the site was occupied by the Corona Ash Dumps, before it was selected as the site of the 1939–1940 World&#x27;s Fair. The theme of the 1939–1940 was &quot;the world of tomorrow&quot;; the event was unprofitable, recouping only 32% of its original cost. After the 1939 fair, the site was used as a park, but fell into disrepair due to a lack of funds. The development of the 1964 fair coincided with social upheavals of the early 1960s, including the civil rights movement, Vietnam War protests, and the aftermath of U.S. President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination.

=== Planning ===

==== World&#x27;s Fair Corporation ====
The idea for the 1964 fair was conceived by a group of businessmen. Among them was Robert Kopple, a lawyer who first discussed the idea at a family dinner in 1958 before suggesting it at a meeting of the Mutual Admiration Society the following year. The year 1964 was nominally selected to coincide with the 300th anniversary of the British conquest of the Dutch colony of New Netherland. Kopple and two friends, Charles Preusse and Thomas J. Deegan, met with 35 potential financiers at the 21 Club restaurant. New York City mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. and parks commissioner Robert Moses formally endorsed the proposal in August 1959, and 75 businessmen formed the New York World&#x27;s Fair 1964 Corporation (WFC) that month. Moses, who saw a 1964 fair as a means to develop the Flushing Meadows site, offered to let the WFC use Flushing Meadows for a nominal fee. The fairground would include the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair site and a part of the nearby Kissena Corridor Park.

The bid required approval from the United States Congress and the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), the French organization that was in charge of approving world&#x27;s fairs. Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., were submitting competing bids, so in October 1959, U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed a committee to review the 1964 world&#x27;s fair bids, and he approved the New York bid later that month. By late 1959, 75 nations had informally indicated an intention to attend the fair, and the WFC began looking for a president and three additional managers in early 1960. Moses was tentatively selected as the WFC&#x27;s president that March, despite Kopple&#x27;s objections that Moses was too old. In turn, Moses would not take the job unless Kopple resigned, as the two men had disagreed bitterly over the canceled Mid-Manhattan Elevated Expressway. After Kopple quit the WFC, Moses formally became the WFC&#x27;s president that May. Moses wanted the fair to run for two years, and consultants for the WFC predicted the fair would have 70 million visitors during that time.

Moses traveled to Paris to ask for the BIE&#x27;s recognition of the fair. The BIE allowed the WFC to begin planning the fair in November 1959, but its officials decided to not formally recognize the fair. Under BIE rules, world&#x27;s fairs could run for only one six-month period, though the WFC had tried to request an exemption. The New York fair would also charge rent to foreign governments, contravening another BIE rule that prevented rent from being charged to exhibitors. In addition, the BIE allowed only one exposition per country every ten years. These rules were not immutable; for example, the BIE had recognized the 1939 fair, even though the previous exposition had run for two seasons. Moses refused to negotiate with BIE officials and treated them derisively, belittling the BIE as a &quot;bunch of clowns in Paris&quot;. Due to Moses&#x27; behavior, the BIE instead decided to approve the 1962 Seattle World&#x27;s Fair, and directed its members to not host official exhibits at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

==== Financing and initial exhibitors ====
The WFC planned to issue $500 million in bonds, a figure that was later decreased to $150 million. Moses said the 1964 fair would be a &quot;billion-dollar&quot; event, though this included expenses for related projects such as roads and the nearby Shea Stadium. The WFC leased about from the city government in May 1960. Moses hired the former lieutenant governor Charles Poletti and the military engineer William Everett Potter to organize the exhibits. A design committee proposed a massive, doughnut-shaped pavilion; Moses rejected the plan and the design committee was forced out by the end of 1959. Moses did not devise a master plan for the fair; he wanted to save the WFC money by having exhibitors erect most of their own pavilions, The city government implemented a building code and health code, which Potter enforced. Nearly all of the buildings were to be temporary structures.

The 1964 fair was to be themed &quot;peace through understanding&quot;. WFC member Jerome Weinstein suggested the motto, which was inspired by an ideal Kopple had wanted for his daughters. According to Moses, the fair was intended &quot;to assist in educating the peoples of the world as to the interdependence of nations and the need for universal lasting peace&quot;. Exhibits were to be divided into five areas, including a transportation area the Port of New York Authority would operate. The original plans called for an amusement park area, which was canceled after the WFC failed to find an operator. By August 1960, the first ten exhibitors had applied for space at the fair, and architectural blueprints for the fair&#x27;s first pavilion had been submitted. The WFC began sending delegations abroad to invite foreign governments to the fair.

In late 1960, the group began issuing $67.5 million in promissory notes to fund construction; the WFC later reduced the amount to $64 million, consisting of $40 million in notes plus $24 million from the city. The WFC&#x27;s finance chairman predicted the fair would earn over $200 million. By the end of 1960, seven countries had agreed to sponsor exhibits. and one-third of the industrial pavilion sites had been leased. Early in 1961, Moses announced the Unisphere would be built as the fair&#x27;s symbol, and the WFC also hired the detective agency Pinkerton to provide security and first-aid services. A report published that January said the fair itself would cost $768 million, although individual exhibitors would pay much of the cost.

=== Construction ===
Exhibitors designed their own pavilions and construction contractors hired members of local labor unions to build the structures. Wagner predicted 10,000 people would be employed during construction. The WFC hosted &quot;preview days&quot; where selected guests could view the construction. The Travelers Companies built information centers across the U.S. to promote the fair, and local chapters of the Elks, Kiwanis, and Rotary clubs promoted the fair nationwide. The WFC issued collectible medallions in bronze and silver that were manufactured by Medallic Art Company. Commemorative postage stamps were issued to celebrate the fair, both inside and outside the U.S. Some New York license plates also bore slogans advertising the fair. Several hotels were built nearby to accommodate fair visitors, and public transit and roads linking the venue were also upgraded. The WFC opened an information office to answer visitors&#x27; questions. Private businesses promoted their products for the fair, and discounted tickets were sold in advance of the opening.

==== 1961 and 1962 ====
William Whipple Jr., the fair&#x27;s chief engineer, said in September 1960 exhibitors would be able to begin erecting pavilions by 1962. Construction of the first building, an administration structure, began in August 1960 and was finished in January 1961. In early 1961, almost all of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park was closed to allow the fair&#x27;s construction, and the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s (LIRR) World&#x27;s Fair station opened. Workers moved trees and diverted parts of the Flushing River into tunnels. By April 1961, thirty-four countries had accepted invitations to the fair, and the city agreed to spend $24 million improving the park. Moses secretly obtained additional funds from the city government; according to Moses&#x27;s biographer Robert Caro, the city government may have spent as much as $60 million on the fair.

In May, the WFC announced it would proceed with the planned amusement area around Meadow Lake, hiring the billionaire H. L. Hunt to operate the rides. By mid-1961, the WFC had privately raised $25 million and was predicting a $53 million profit. The groundbreaking ceremony for the first pavilion took place that June. The WFC had difficulty selling the remaining bonds; it had sold around $30 million in promissory notes—three quarters of the total—by the end of 1961. During the fair&#x27;s construction, civil-rights activists expressed concerns the WFC&#x27;s leadership included very few African Americans. Moses met with activists but he still did not appoint African Americans to leadership positions, which attracted controversy amid the ongoing civil rights movement. The WFC hired an African American executive to the fair&#x27;s international division in 1962. Later that year, New York governor Nelson Rockefeller formed a committee to investigate persistent complaints about discrimination within the WFC.

By the beginning of 1962, more than 60 nations, the governments of 30 U.S. states, and 50 companies had agreed to exhibit at the fair. The WFC also created a scale model of the fairground. The LIRR constructed a siding from the Port Washington Branch, allowing trains to deliver material onsite. At a luncheon in March that year, Moses said construction had fallen behind schedule. The WFC had allocated $6 million to advertise the fair by mid-1962, and Deegan predicted its participants would spend another $75 million of their own money on promotion. The WFC tried to attract Latin American countries to the fair. By late 1962, exhibits were being finalized and many pavilions were being constructed. Either 68 or 71 nations had announced plans for exhibits at the fair by then, though only 35 countries had formally leased space. Additionally, 125 businesses had expressed interest, and the WFC had finished installing utilities on the fairground. At the end of 1962, a small number of state and international pavilions were being built, while work in the industrial and transportation areas was progressing. Groundbreaking ceremonies were hosted for many of the international pavilions.

==== 1963 and 1964 ====
In early 1963, the World&#x27;s Fair Housing Bureau was formed to coordinate the development of hotel rooms for the fair. Despite commitments from state and national governments, only some of these governments were actively constructing pavilions. The WFC wanted to hire 40 concessionaires and sell 70 intellectual property (IP) licenses, which the corporation hoped would raise $130 million. On April 22, 1963, exactly a year before the fair&#x27;s opening, the U.S. President John F. Kennedy activated a clock that would count down to the opening. Only 48 of the 200 proposed buildings had begun construction, even though construction of all major structures had to be underway by the following month. The press building opened that May, and the following month, an insurance syndicate was formed to protect the exhibits. By mid-1963, civil-rights groups were protesting the lack of racial diversity in the fair&#x27;s development, and filed a lawsuit to halt construction. That July, Moses denied rumors construction had fallen behind schedule.

Materials from overseas began arriving in August 1963, though work on 50 structures had not started by the next month. Moses became increasingly hostile toward journalists who doubted that the fair would be completed on time. There were also disagreements over discounted tickets for students; Moses opposed the plan but the city government ultimately forced him to sell discounted tickets. The first pavilion, the Port Authority Heliport, was opened in October 1963. The same month, Hunt resigned as the amusement area&#x27;s operator following disagreements over ticket prices and rides. Work on many of the pavilions was behind schedule due to funding issues, labor shortages, and poor weather. There were also labor strikes, exhibitor withdrawals, and continuing racial tensions. Despite these difficulties, many pavilions were nearly completed by late 1963, and the WFC had sold 3.8 million advance tickets by the year&#x27;s end. To draw attention to the fair, the WFC displayed models of exhibits at the Time-Life Building in Manhattan. Exhibits were installed through late 1963 and early 1964, and the WFC borrowed $3 million to fund the fair&#x27;s completion.

In January 1964, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported the site was filled with raw material, incomplete building frames, and unpaved roads. That month, WFC officials said work on 26 buildings was behind schedule, and they sought to demolish a pavilion that would not be ready for the fair&#x27;s opening. The WFC signed a document outlining ways profits from the fair were to be used. By that February, most of the major pavilions and attractions were complete, but Whipple estimated up to 10 pavilions would not be finished before the fair&#x27;s opening. The same month, the WFC stopped selling advance tickets, having sold 28 million. There were still 4,800 construction workers on site in late March, when the state government began hiring people for the fair. Before the fair opened, the WFC had spent $30 million.

== Operation ==
The WFC originally predicted a daily attendance of 225,000. Deegan predicted at least 6.7 million foreign visitors, out of an estimated total of 70 million. Visitors 13 and older were originally charged the adult admission price of $2.00 (), while children 2–12 years old were charged $1.00 (). The WFC sold discounted tickets in packs of 20; some major companies like AT&amp;T bought hundreds of thousands of tickets for their employees. Students paid 25 cents if they visited with their teachers, and the WFC sold certificates that allowed a class of 25 students to enter the fair for $6.25. Moses predicted ticket sales of $120 million and a net profit of $40 million. Initially, city officials predicted people would spend $5 billion in the city due to the fair, an estimate that was later reduced to $2.5 billion.

Though the fair employed up to 20,000 people but the WFC directly employed only between 180 and 200 people. There were 3,000 Pinkerton employees on the grounds, including firefighters, police officers, medics, matrons, and ticket sellers. Nine garbage trucks, nine emergency medical services (EMS) vehicles, 25 police cars, and three fire engines traveled the fairgrounds. Nine city health inspectors examined all of the on-site restaurants. United Press International (UPI) was the fair&#x27;s official photographer, while United World Films had exclusive rights to produce and publish films about the fair. Allied Maintenance was the only maintenance firm allowed to work at the fair; it charged exorbitant fees, earning $10 million during 1964 alone. Allied also handled deliveries during the 1964 season but was replaced the following year with Rentar Corporation. Other companies, such as Hertz and Cities Service, sponsored free services or events. The WFC selected symbols of a boy and a girl as the fair&#x27;s mascots.

Exhibitors were required to operate from 10 am to 10 pm daily, although the fairground opened at 9 am. Exhibits were prepared and cleaned throughout the night; the Vatican pavilion was the only attraction with a live-in caretaker. Many exhibitors hired racially diverse staff. In addition, the WFC required each exhibitor to purchase insurance from Campo &amp; Roberts, which earned $3 million from insurance commissions.

=== 1964 season ===
==== Opening ====
The WFC did not host official press previews in the weeks before the official opening, though several exhibitors hosted previews of their pavilions. The night before the fair opened, the television series &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot; broadcast an opening celebration. When the World&#x27;s Fair officially opened at 9:00 am on April 22, 1964, the first visitor was a college student from New Jersey. The opening was celebrated with speeches by Robert Moses, Nelson Rockefeller, and the U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson. The same day, Johnson dedicated the United States Pavilion, while Rockefeller and Moses dedicated the New York State Pavilion.

During the opening ceremonies, hundreds of civil-rights activists organized a sit-in and were arrested. The civil-rights group Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) proposed a &quot;stall-in&quot; to block roads leading to the fair, but few activists participated. The opening ceremony attracted 90,000 attendees, fewer than half of the predicted number, in part due to inclement weather. The WFC banned picketing on the grounds, prompting lawsuits from civil-rights groups; a federal judge later ruled protesters could give out handbills to passers-by.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported fifteen pavilions and three amusement attractions were not finished by opening day. One pavilion, the Belgian Village, was not completed until the end of the 1964 season, though it did operate for part of that year. Some pavilions could not open on schedule because artifacts in the pavilions had been damaged or were incomplete. Exhibitors also accused workers of delaying some pavilions&#x27; construction to collect overtime pay. Three incomplete pavilions were abandoned, and work on other pavilions continued for several months after the opening. The rich and famous, including government officials and heads of state, visited the fairground in the weeks after it opened.

====May to October====
The fair needed 220,000 daily visitors to recover its operating expenses of $300,000 per day. In its first week, the fair recorded nearly a million visitors, and 150,000 daily visitors—60 percent of initial projections—in the first month. Several problems arose; disputes occurred over labor unions, maintenance fees, and a mural in the Jordan pavilion. Thefts and breakdowns regularly occurred. Exhibitors complained about high rental rates and insufficient maintenance of the fairground. The Lake Amusement Area was especially unprofitable; it had few attractions and was difficult to access. Many of the most-popular exhibits charged an additional fee, and visitors often did not bring enough money for food or for high-priced exhibits.

The WFC unsuccessfully attempted to entice visitors by offering discounts to taxi drivers and improving fairground lighting, and the WFC was planning promotional campaigns by the end of June. The J. Walter Thompson Company advertised the fair in New York City–area media. By mid-1964, some exhibitors had gone out of business, including the two largest shows in the Lake Amusement Area. Employees, especially the 4,000 college students who worked the fair, faced occupational burnout. Despite the troubles, the WFC was able to buy back one quarter of its promissory notes in mid-1964, and to attract visitors, exhibitors publicly downplayed their grievances with the WFC. The industrial and international pavilions were more profitable than the amusement area, whose financial troubles did not bother Moses.

The fair had difficulty attracting more than 200,000 daily visitors, even during July and August when students were on summer break. The fair recorded 13.4 million visitors by the season&#x27;s midpoint in July 1964, and it received 5.8 million visitors that August, the highest of any month during the 1964 season. Nearly half of visitors came from the New York City area, and prospective visitors expressed fears about crime and unrest. Attendance declined significantly in September when children returned to school. In response, Moses said journalists were tarnishing the fair&#x27;s reputation and accused them of suppressing attendance. An exhibitors&#x27; committee made several recommendations for increasing attendance but Moses rejected nearly all of them.

The fair closed for the season on October 18, 1964. There had been 33 million visitors, including 27 million who paid admission. &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited several reasons for the reduced attendance figures; these included fears of crime, lengthy queues, and high prices. The WFC had significantly overpaid several contractors, and the fair&#x27;s operating expenditures during 1964 amounted to $33.3 million, twice the original budget. Moses had projected a $53 million surplus, but the surplus stood at only $12.6 million at season&#x27;s end, barely enough to pay back the city government. The WFC reduced its estimated total profit for both seasons to $30 million. Despite the financial problems, many industrial pavilions had long queues and tens of thousands of daily visitors, and the General Motors and Vatican pavilions each saw more than 10 million visitors during 1964. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported many international exhibitors were pleased with the fair but wanted someone else to operate it.

=== Off-season ===
Between the 1964 and 1965 seasons, the WFC hired 400 security guards to oversee the fairground, though exhibitors were obligated to maintain and guard their own pavilions. The WFC planned to spend $1.3 million on renovations, and 3,000 workers began winterizing the fairground in November 1964. The WFC planned to create a promotional film and advertisements for the fair, and it kept some of the paths and fountains illuminated. Deegan said several pavilions would be renovated and 12 new restaurants would be added. Moses also traveled around the world to persuade foreign exhibitors to display additional artifacts, such as a Gutenberg Bible and Spanish artwork, during 1965.

WFC officials said attendance would rise during the 1965 season, and anticipated 37.5 million visitors. The prediction was unrealistic; previous world&#x27;s fairs typically had fewer visitors during their second season and no new pavilions were being planned. In its balance sheet, the WFC counted profits from advance ticket sales as part of its income for 1964, which meant revenue would be much lower than expected during 1965. Unless the fair had at least 37.5 million visitors in 1965, it would not be profitable. WFC officials, fearing reprisal from Moses, waited weeks to tell him about the fair&#x27;s financial troubles. In November 1964, Moses told Wagner the WFC might not be able to repay the city&#x27;s $24 million loan. The WFC&#x27;s financial advisors raised suspicions of financial mismanagement the next month.

In January 1965, several of the WFC&#x27;s financial advisors quit following bitter disputes, and the WFC requested $3.5 million to reopen the fair. The city controller Abraham Beame began auditing the WFC, and the WFC fired Deegan&#x27;s public-relations firm, which had been receiving $300,000 annually for four years, following criticism over the firm&#x27;s compensation. The WFC&#x27;s internal audit found a $17.5 million deficit, but lawsuits delayed Beame&#x27;s audit for several months. By February 1965, at least 14 exhibitors in the 1964 season had declared bankruptcy. Franklin National Bank offered to lend the WFC $3.5 million, but the WFC indicated it needed only $1 million. Though city officials wanted to remove Moses as the WFC&#x27;s president, he retained his position. When Moses said he would spend $6.4 million to renovate Flushing Meadows–Corona Park before repaying debts, the WFC&#x27;s finance chairman resigned. Two Marine Midland Bank branches provided a $1 million loan to the WFC that March, which the WFC repaid two months later.

During the off-season, several exhibitors renovated and modified their pavilions, spending over $7 million between them. At least 50 exhibits were upgraded and five major attractions were added, along with free entertainments and science demonstrations. New artworks and films were added to several pavilions. The struggling Lake Amusement Area became the Lake Area. The WFC asked the New York City Transit Authority to increase subway service to the fair, and 26 exhibitors collaborated on a promotional campaign. Fifty-three exhibitors proposed naming the first week of the 1965 season Fair Festival Week, to which Wagner agreed. The WFC produced a promotional film titled &quot;To the Fair&quot;, and individual exhibitors produced their own films. To reduce its debts, the WFC decreased its budget for the 1965 season and dismissed some employees.

=== 1965 season ===
More than 150,000 people attended the reopening of the fair on April 21, 1965. The Ethiopian long-distance runners Abebe Bikila and Mamo Wolde participated in a ceremonial half marathon, running from Central Park in Manhattan to Singer Bowl at the fairground. Unlike the 1964 opening ceremony, no protests occurred at the fair&#x27;s reopening, and almost all exhibits were completed on time. For the 1965 season, adult admission fees were raised to $2.50 (). During the first 20 days of the 1965 season, attendance declined 22 percent compared with the same time period in 1964, putting many exhibitors at risk of bankruptcy. In addition, fewer visitors were paying at the gates because more than half of them carried advance tickets. Exhibitors requested a reduction in admission fees, and that a reduced-price evening admission ticket be sold. Moses refused both proposals, and several exhibitors threatened to close their pavilions before retracting.

At the beginning of the 1965 season, there were issues such as race-related protests, Vietnam War protests, a controversy over a racially insensitive song in one pavilion, and disputes between Jewish and Arab exhibitors. Vandalism also increased due to the reduced police presence, and a fairgoer was murdered that May. WFC officials also tried to invalidate their January 1964 agreement for disbursing the fair&#x27;s profits, and exhibitors continued to lose money due to lower-than-expected attendance. Fewer visitors came during the evening, but the WFC again rejected a proposal for discounted evening admission in July 1965. Despite increased attendance in mid-1965, the fair continued to record decreased revenue compared with 1964. Many exhibitors recorded substantial losses from the costs of their pavilions. By August 1965, the WFC was preparing to clear the fairground after the fair, though 13 exhibitors had declared bankruptcy and could not afford to demolish or move their pavilions.

Beame&#x27;s interim report, which was published at the end of August, found the WFC had squandered money by not awarding contracts through competitive bidding and by spending nearly everything it had on expenses it incurred before and during 1964. Despite Moses&#x27;s denials of wrongdoing, Queens district attorney Frank D. O&#x27;Connor opened a criminal inquiry into the WFC shortly afterward. Moses installed highway signs promoting the fair and refused to remove them, even after city traffic commissioner Henry A. Barnes called the signs a safety hazard. By mid-September, estimates of the fair&#x27;s total attendance had been reduced from 70 to 50 million. By the end of September, the fair had recorded 17 million visitors during the 1965 season, less than half the number of visitors needed to break even. At this point, the WFC had barely enough money to pay its weekly expenses.

Toward the end of the 1965 season, there was a sustained increase in attendance, and the fair recorded more than 250,000 daily visitors for three consecutive weeks. Exhibitors worried potential visitors would be dissuaded by the overcrowding. The architect and writer Robert A. M. Stern attributed the increase in attendance to a prevailing feeling the 1964 fair would be one of the last lavish world&#x27;s fairs. Pope Paul VI visited the fair on October 4, 1965, during the first-ever papal visit to the United States. The fair closed on October 17, 1965, and recorded its highest-ever daily attendance of 446,953 on its final day. The fair&#x27;s final day was chaotic, with reports of vandalism and theft. In total, the fair had recorded 51,607,448 admissions, seven million more than the 1939 fair and ten million more than Expo 58. The GM and Vatican pavilions had been the most popular. The fair had lost an additional $1 million in 1965 and had a deficit of up to $40 million at its closing; &quot;The New York Times&quot; partly attributed the fair&#x27;s underperformance to Moses&#x27;s stubborn attitude and refusal to take advice.

== Fairground ==
The fairground was divided into five regions. Exhibits for individual U.S. states and the U.S. federal government were concentrated in the Federal &amp; State Area at the center of the fairground near the Unisphere. The international exhibits were concentrated in the International Area—a group of pavilions surrounding the Unisphere. Industry pavilions were concentrated around the Industrial Area on the eastern end near the Van Wyck Expressway. The Transportation Area was on the western side of the fairground. South of the Long Island Expressway, connected with the rest of the fair only via one overpass, was the Lake Amusement Area (known as the Lake Area during 1965). Eight gates provided access to the fairground.

The 1964 World&#x27;s Fair had 139 pavilions on opening day, in addition to 34 concessions and shows. Of the pavilions and shows, either 121 or 124 were free, and the rest required an additional payment. Scattered across the fairground were 5,300 trees, 3,500 benches, 1,400 telephones, and 60 mailboxes. There were also bank branches, picnic areas, and restrooms. Accessible bathrooms, wheelchair rental stands, and Braille guidebooks were provided for disabled visitors. There were also several hotels nearby, albeit few campgrounds. A spokesman for the 1964 fair said the exposition was supposed to be &quot;cultural and sophisticated&quot;, and Deegan claimed that the exposition would be the &quot;greatest single event in history&quot;.

=== Pavilions ===

Each section of the fair was designed in several architectural styles, and many of the pavilions were designed in a Space Age style. Some pavilions used experimental designs; for example, the Bell System Pavilion was supported by massive cantilevers, while the IBM Pavilion was shaped like a giant egg. Most of the structures were designed so they could easily be demolished after the fair and rebuilt elsewhere. Any person or entity who could afford to rent the land and construct a pavilion could rent exhibition space at the fair. Thus, the space was dominated by large corporations. Private companies spent a combined $300 million on their pavilions. The Big Three car manufacturers—Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors—alone spent a combined $110 million on attractions such as Chrysler&#x27;s artificial islands, Ford&#x27;s Magic Skyway, and General Motors&#x27; Futurama car ride.

Twenty-three state pavilions were built. The fair included exhibits from 24 U.S. states; these were Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the six states in New England. New York City had its own pavilion, as did the neighborhood of Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. Nineteen of the state pavilions were in the Federal and State Area, and three of the other four state pavilions were clustered around Meadow Lake at the southern end of the fair. None of the state governments had to pay rent for the land, but they had to fund the buildings. Twenty states and Washington, D.C., did not pay for exhibits at the fair.

There were 45 pavilions in the International Area, most of which featured exhibits from foreign countries. Individual exhibits were presented by 66 nations, including the United States, whose pavilion was in the Federal and State Area. If nations that were represented only by one city or region are included, the fair had attractions from 80 countries. Foreign nations rented land from the WFC, and paid for staff lodgings, food, and other expenses. Many nations from Asia, Africa, and Central and South America, though relatively few from Europe, exhibited at the fair. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, boycotted the fair because the BIE had not approved it. Because of a lack of participation from BIE members, only six major countries—Egypt, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, and Pakistan—had official exhibits at the fair. Some BIE member countries hosted unofficial exhibits or were represented by those of private companies, and several countries were represented solely by an industry exhibit. Other countries were represented by regional pavilions, such as those for the Caribbean and Africa. Many of the international pavilions sold merchandise.

The Industrial Area had 43 pavilions, representing nearly 350 American companies. Most of the companies were consolidated within four exhibit buildings, though about 36 companies had their own pavilions. Corporations rented land from the WFC, while religious organizations were not required to pay for their space. Large firms such as Bell Telephone Company, DuPont, IBM, Kodak, RCA, The Travelers Companies, and US Royal Tires participated. The 1964 fair included only a few companies in the food, chemical, tobacco, cosmetic, or pharmaceutical industries. Transportation companies, including the Big Three car makers, displayed products in the Transportation Area of the fairground. Several of the industry pavilions offered free merchandise or other sponsorships, which often attracted customers. Moses provided about of land for religious groups and invited every major sect of Christianity to the fair. Eight religious pavilions were built, each of which was staffed by volunteers. Some exhibits were planned but never built, such as the Soviet and Israel pavilions, but were displayed on official maps, causing confusion among visitors.

=== Amusement ===
In addition to pavilions, the Lake Area included several rides and attractions during 1964. John Ringling North operated a circus that performed in a 5,000-seat tent. Nearby was a wax museum. The amusement area also included a children&#x27;s play area, a puppet show, a porpoise show, and other amusements. A lake cruise traveled off the shore of Meadow Lake and an early log flume ride was also installed at the fair. A replica of the ship &quot;Santa María&quot; was displayed in the lake. There was a 10,000-seat outdoor theater in the amusement area as well. Two Coney Island carousels were combined to form the Flushing Meadows Carousel.

The Florida pavilion took over much of the Lake Area in 1965, and two amusement areas called Carnival and Continental Park were added. Outside the Lake Area were the Fiesta Playground and the Sculpture Continuum Playground.

=== Transportation ===
The American Machine and Foundry Company constructed a suspended monorail with two tracks in the Lake Area. The line had seven 80-passenger, two-car-long trains. Another transport attraction at the fair was the Swiss Sky Ride, a ski lift or aerial gondola that was sponsored by the Government of Switzerland. During the 1964 season, visitors could rent one of 147 Greyhound Escorters, which were driven by chauffeurs. Sixty-one Glide-a-Ride trolleys also served the fairground during both seasons.

The fairground was accessed via highways on Long Island that had been upgraded. An expanded World&#x27;s Fair Marina provided access via Flushing Bay. The fair was also served by a short-lived ferry service to Manhattan, as well as other ferry routes to ports in New York and New Jersey. A helicopter shuttle provided services to the Pan Am Building and Lower Manhattan heliports. Local buses, airport shuttle buses, the New York City Subway, and the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) also stopped near the fairground. The subway cars R33S and R36WF were constructed for the number seven route that served Willets Point station near the fair. Although a dedicated subway line had served the 1939 fair, no such route was built for 1964. A luxury bus service carried &quot;distinguished guests&quot; to and from the fair. There were 20,000 parking spaces, and shuttle buses transported people from the parking lots to the main gate.

=== Other features ===
The fairground had nine fountains and eleven reflecting pools. Seven of the fountains had custom designs, although none have survived. At the center of the fair was the Unisphere, which was constructed by American Bridge Company. Weighing , the globe was created to symbolize &quot;man&#x27;s achievements on a shrinking globe in an expanding universe&quot;. The Fountain of the Planets (Pool of Industry), which is located at the far eastern end of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, could spray water up to high, and it hosted nightly fireworks displays and music performances. The Unisphere and Fountain of the Planets are connected via the Fountain of the Fairs, which included a five-section reflecting pool and two rectangular pools.

The fairground had , , or of paths, and numerous plazas. Throughout the fairground were information booths operated by Greyhound Bus. Near the northern end of the fairground was a customs building, where customs officials examined items bound for the fair&#x27;s international pavilions and concessionaires. There was a press building next to the Grand Central Parkway, with a reporters&#x27; bullpen, offices for major news agencies, a press conference room, and offices. The on-site, 22-room Atomedic Hospital was constantly staffed, and there were five first-aid stations. About 300 closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) were installed across the fairground, and a film studio for independent filmmakers was also built. Pinkerton matrons operated a lost-child bureau with activities and games for lost children.

== Culture ==
Foreign cultures and American technologies were featured at the fair. While WFC rules technically prevented the fair&#x27;s officials from influencing the design or contents of any exhibits, the WFC retained a significant influence on the contents of exhibits. For example, developing nations were encouraged to show their art and culture rather than technology, and WFC officials pressured Islamic nations to emphasize their religion.

=== Cuisine ===
The fair had a large number of restaurants and eateries. When it opened, there were between 110 and 114 eateries, 61 of which were within pavilions. There were six specialty restaurants and 25 fine-dining restaurants operated by Brass Rail. Restaurant Associates was contracted to operate several of the restaurants but its contract was canceled because of a dispute over signage, and Brass Rail instead received the contract. Ten of Brass Rail&#x27;s restaurants were designed by Victor Lundy and had canopies shaped like bunches of white balloons. For the 1965 season, the fair was expanded to include 198 restaurants.

Cuisine sold at the fair included Belgian waffles, 7 Up drinks, dumplings, pizza, tacos, kimchi, Turkish coffee, tandoori chicken, and hummus. Many of these dishes became popular in New York City and in the U.S. after the fair closed. The Thailand pavilion included North America&#x27;s first Thai restaurant, while the Malaysia pavilion served Tiger Beer and satay. During the 1964 season, many meals cost 99 cents because any food below $1 could not be taxed. Brewers spent millions of dollars persuading exhibitors to sell their beers.

=== Performances ===
There were more than 30 entertainment events at the fair. Moses disdained carnival-style attractions, saying there would be &quot;no whiskered women, tattooed giants, nudes on ice ... The appeal of a world&#x27;s fair should not be entirely below the Adam&#x27;s apple&quot;. As the WFC&#x27;s president, Moses reserved the right to ban any project from the fair. Shows that appealed to prurient interests, like semi-nude dancing, were excluded. An exception was the adult-only, musical puppet show &quot;Les Poupées de Paris&quot; (The Dolls of Paris). The lack of adult shows may have contributed to the amusement area&#x27;s unpopularity in 1964. The ban on adult shows was relaxed in 1965, and nine discotheques opened at the fair during that season. That May, a striptease show in the Louisiana pavilion lasted two performances before it was canceled.

Musical and theatrical performances took place at several pavilions, and there were fireworks and water shows at the Pool of Industry. Among the theatrical shows were the revues &quot;To Broadway With Love&quot;, &quot;Wonder World&quot;—which lasted two months— and &quot;Summer Time Revue&quot;. DuPont presented a musical revue in its own pavilion, &quot;The Wonderful World of Chemistry&quot;. A controversial minstrel show in the Louisiana pavilion was canceled after two days. International pavilions, such as the African, Indonesia, and Spain pavilions, also hosted dance and other live shows.

Sporting events, such as wrestling, boxing, gymnastics, fencing, judo, and weightlifting, took place at the fair. Some of these events were presented as part of the 1964 Summer Olympics tryouts in New York City. Other shows included the ice-skating show &quot;Dick Button&#x27;s Ice-Travaganza&quot; at the New York City Pavilion, and the Auto Thrill Show in the Transportation Area. &quot;To Broadway With Love&quot; and the &quot;Ice-Travaganza&quot; closed within a few months of the fair&#x27;s opening. A parade traveled across the fairground every day. The evangelist Billy Graham gave daily sermons at the Billy Graham Pavilion.

=== Music and film ===
The fairground did not emphasize music, although a &quot;World&#x27;s Fair Festival&quot; took place at Lincoln Center in Manhattan. Popular and classical music was broadcast from 800 lampposts on the fairground. The fair also had an official band; Cities Service&#x27;s World&#x27;s Band of America, a 50-piece ensemble, was headed by the conductor Paul Lavalle. Other ensembles, including Guy Lombardo, the United States Marine Band, and the United States Navy Steel Band, performed throughout the fair. During 1964, the amusement area hosted rock-and-roll concerts that were popular among local youth; Moses, who abhorred the genre, canceled these concerts when he learned about them.

The fairground contained about 40 movie theaters, most of which were housed within pavilions, for which fifty films were produced. These included several religious films: &quot;Parable&quot; at the Protestant and Orthodox pavilion; &quot;Man in the 5th Dimension&quot; at the Billy Graham pavilion; and &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Happiness&quot; at the LDS pavilion. The Johnson&#x27;s Wax pavilion screened a film titled &quot;To Be Alive!&quot;, which later won an Academy Award. The WFC produced a film promoting the fair in seven languages in 1964.

=== Art and artifacts ===
Originally, the WFC made no effort to coordinate art exhibitions at the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair, and Moses did not wish to subsidize art exhibits on the fairground, nor did he want to pay for an art pavilion himself. After commentators spoke about the lack of art at the fair, Moses changed his mind and allowed states to display art in their pavilions. Ten pop artists designed art for the New York State Pavilion&#x27;s Theaterama, and the Fine Arts pavilion displayed 250 contemporary artists&#x27; work.

Foreign nations also displayed art and artifacts at the fair. Spain displayed works from artists such as Francisco Goya, El Greco, Joan Miró, Pablo Picasso, and Diego Velázquez. The United Arab Republic displayed artifacts from several historical eras; the Sudan pavilion displayed a 1,300-year-old Madonna fresco; the Jordan pavilion showed the Dead Sea Scrolls; and the Republic of China pavilion displayed Chinese jade. During the 1965 season, the Mexico pavilion displayed art, including Mesoamerican pieces and works by José Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Rufino Tamayo. Though art was also displayed in gift shops throughout the fair, WFC officials generally only publicized artwork that was exhibited in pavilions.

There were 95 sculptures at the fair, including five permanent sculptures, four which remain in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park: &quot;Forms in Transit&quot; by Theodore Roszak, &quot;Freedom of the Human Spirit&quot; by Marshall Fredericks, &quot;Free Form&quot; by José de Rivera, and &quot;Rocket Thrower&quot; by Donald De Lue. &quot;Armillary Sphere&quot; by Paul Manship, was vandalized and the remaining pieces were stolen in 1980. The temporary sculptures included &quot;Pietà&quot; by Michelangelo at the Vatican pavilion, which was one of the fair&#x27;s most-popular exhibits.

=== Consumer products ===
The 1964 World&#x27;s Fair introduced and showed many consumer products, in what one magazine called &quot;the ultimate marketing bonanza of [its] time&quot;. Color television was popularized at the fair, and the Ford Mustang was launched just before its appearance at the fair. The fair also displayed technologies such as Picturephones and IBM computers, as well as electronic devices that could display personalized data to visitors. Some pavilions incorporated personal computers into their exhibits, and many visitors saw touchtone phones for the first time while at the fair. Other innovations, such as thermonuclear fusion power plants, undersea hotels, underground houses, jet packs, and Corfam synthetic leather, never became popular.

== Aftermath ==

=== Site usage ===
==== Site clearing ====

Moses predicted the WFC would need to spend $11.6 million to clear Flushing Meadows–Corona Park after the fair closed. He recommended the demolition of most of the pavilions. By mid-1965, the WFC proposed the preservation of 19 structures, while the remaining pavilions were offered to anyone who could afford to relocate them. Several exhibitors, including U.S. Steel and Thailand, chose to sell their buildings due to the high cost of demolition, while others sold the contents of their pavilions, and people offered to salvage parts of some buildings. Any other buildings had to be demolished within 90 days of the fair&#x27;s closure. Each exhibitor was supposed to have placed money in escrow or posted a bond to cover the demolition costs, but most exhibitors had not done so. The WFC feared exhibitors would abandon their pavilions.

Demolition began the day after the fair closed and the rubble was dumped into Flushing Bay. By November, the site was filled with rubbish and rats. Scientists temporarily preserved three of the fair&#x27;s buildings for structural testing. The deadline for demolition was extended to December 1966, and by the middle of that year, about 24 structures remained. Moses suggested his Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority should provide funding to convert the fairground into a park. The city government took over Flushing Meadows–Corona Park from the WFC in June 1967. Few improvements were made to the park for several years and many of the remaining structures were vandalized. According to a 1986 report, the city government had to spend $107 million ($ million in ) to turn the fairground into a park. In the 1980s, a 1989 World&#x27;s Fair was proposed for the site to mark the 25th Anniversary of the 1964 fair, but the proposal was unsuccessful. The paths remain almost unchanged into the 21st century.

==== Remaining structures ====

Some of the structures from the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair, including the fair&#x27;s symbol the Unisphere, remain in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. Near the Unisphere is the Column of Jerash from Jordan&#x27;s pavilion, a stone bench marking the site of the Vatican pavilion, and a plaque on the site of the Garden of Meditation. The New York City Pavilion houses Queens Museum, and the New York Hall of Science is also preserved as a museum. The western side of the fairground site includes the Port Authority pavilion, which became the Terrace on the Park banquet hall; the Winston Churchill Tribute, which became an aviary for Queens Zoo; and the Flushing Meadows Carousel. The New York State Pavilion is largely unused , but its former Theaterama is used by Queens Theatre in the Park. The World&#x27;s Fair Marina along Flushing Bay still operates. Other buildings, including the Travel and Transportation Pavilion, the United States Pavilion, the Aquacade amphitheater, and the Singer Bowl remained for several years before their demolition.

Other structures were relocated after the fair closed; among these were the Austria, Christian Science, Denmark, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mormon, Parker Pen, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, and Wisconsin pavilions. the Uniroyal Giant Tire and Golden Rondelle Theater. In some cases, only parts of buildings were preserved due to the high cost of full preservation. The LIRR, Mormon, Socony Mobil, and West Berlin pavilions, as well as the monorail, Poupees des Paris, and the wax museum, were preserved within New York. Other objects, including parts of the Hollywood and Ireland pavilions, the Coca-Cola pavilion&#x27;s carillon, the It&#x27;s a Small World ride, Progressland carousel, and the Swiss Sky Ride, were sent further afield. Some pavilions, such as Clairol&#x27;s &quot;color carousel&quot; and Sinclair Oil&#x27;s dinosaur exhibits, became traveling exhibitions.

=== Profitability and effect on other world&#x27;s fairs ===
Profits from the fair would have been used to improve Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, and many of its restaurants broke even. On the fair&#x27;s closing day, the WFC had $11.58 million in cash. Moses anticipated the WFC would not be able to repay the remaining $22.4 million in promissory notes, and the WFC was expecting to default on 60 percent of the bonds it had issued. In December 1965, Beame determined the fair had lost $20.1 million in 1964 due to improper management. The WFC later agreed to pay noteholders another $4 million in mid-1966, although it struggled to fulfill its obligation to restore the fairground.

During the late 1960s, the WFC was separately investigated on charges of financial mismanagement regarding the Belgian Village pavilion, and the New York state government opened a racketeering investigation into the fair&#x27;s construction. The city government received $1.5 million in profits from the fair in 1972, following several years of legal disputes. The fair recorded a net loss of $21.1 million, and bondholders received back about one-third of their original investments. In total, the WFC and other public agencies had spent $83.832 million on permanent improvements to the site during the 1964 fair.

In part because of the 1964 fair&#x27;s unprofitability, many industrial exhibitors were reluctant to sponsor major exhibits at the next world&#x27;s fair, Expo 67 in Montreal, Canada, and two other American cities withdrew proposals for world&#x27;s fairs in the 1960s and 1970s. Citing the 1964 fair, Expo 67&#x27;s organizers heavily invested in amusement attractions, sought and received BIE approval, and constructed pavilions ahead of schedule. Expo 67 officials also sought positive press coverage for their fair, a significant departure from Moses&#x27;s negative reaction to every perceived criticism.

== Impact ==
=== Reception ===
==== Contemporaneous ====
Before the fair opened, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it a &quot;mixed boon&quot; to New York City because BIE members had boycotted the fair. In late 1963, just before the fair opened, an Associated Press reporter called it &quot;a big city cousin to the familiar county fair&quot; and said it was becoming one of the United States&#x27; most comprehensive exhibits of industries and businesses. A British newspaper called the fair &quot;a great big grown-up Disneyland&quot;.

After the fair&#x27;s opening, &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Ebony&quot; magazines called it one of mankind&#x27;s largest expositions, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote the attractions and pavilions were &quot;hard to resist&quot;. Several writers criticized the large number of industrial exhibits at the fair, and observers complained about the wastefulness of the pavilions&#x27; temporary nature. During the second season, &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote the fair was unsuccessful because of long queues, meager exhibits, high prices, and the overwhelmingly large number of attractions for visitors. When the fair closed, a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reporter wrote it had failed because it &quot;lacked coordination, a common purpose that could be transmitted to the community&quot;. Russell Lynes said the concept of the fair was flawed because instant communication between countries was already possible.

There was also commentary on the conflicting architectural styles, which were controversial even before the official opening. In 1961, John Canaday of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote he would be surprised if the fair were not &quot;a mess and disaster architecturally&quot;. After the fair opened, Ada Louise Huxtable of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the fair was architecturally &quot;grotesque&quot;, while other critics criticized the structures as befitting Coney Island or a street fair. The critic Vincent Scully Jr., in a &quot;Life&quot; magazine article, wrote: &quot;If This Is Architecture, God Help Us&quot;. In June 1964, &quot;Time&quot; said the fair had &quot;grace and substance&quot; despite the presence of some &quot;tacky&quot; attractions, a sentiment repeated in &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;. The American Institute of Architects gave awards for excellence in design to several pavilions. A &quot;Newsday&quot; reporter described the fair as &quot;both garish and subtle, tawdry and tasteful, ephemeral and lasting&quot;. After the fair closed, architectural critic Wolf Von Eckardt said the fair was &quot;a frightening image of ourselves&quot; because of its &quot;chaotic&quot; architecture.

==== Retrospective ====
In 1967, &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Robert Alden wrote the 1964 fair benefited from &quot;participation of private industry on a massive scale&quot; and that more countries were participating in Expo 67. Another &quot;Times&quot; writer said in 1989: &quot;The 1964 fair was not as self-conscious a portrayal of the future so much as a display of contemporary American achievements&quot;. The same year, a &quot;Newsday&quot; reporter wrote the 1964 fair had occurred at a time when audiences were no longer awed by cultural and technological innovations. Robert A. M. Stern wrote in 1995 the 1964 fair had been so attractive in part because &quot;it was out of place amid the realities of life in the nuclear age&quot;.

David W. Dunlap wrote in 2001 the 1964 fair was still ingrained in the public imagination, even though it had been &quot;a tailfin-tacky celebration of jet-age technological hubris&quot; and an &quot;unhappy final chapter&quot; to Moses&#x27;s career as New York City&#x27;s main urban planner. According to the author Lawrence R. Samuel, the fair&#x27;s motto &quot;peace through understanding&quot; was overshadowed by the fair&#x27;s focus on profits, and a &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reporter wrote in 2013 the fair had been dominated by corporate exhibitors. In the same year, Joseph Tirella wrote although &quot;peace through understanding continues to elude us&quot;, the United States had become more ethnically diverse due to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which was enacted just before the fair ended.

According to &quot;New York Daily News&quot; in 2012, the remaining structures from the fair &quot;have provided [Flushing Meadows–Corona Park] with some of its most striking structures&quot;. For the fair&#x27;s 50th anniversary, &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine wrote the fair&#x27;s &quot;limitless faith in material and social progress&quot; had been counteracted by the social upheaval in the U.S. that took place during the mid-1960s. In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the fair was a showcase for futuristic technology and a place where &quot;foreigners could broadcast their best wares and fairgoers could catch a glimpse into their far-off cultures&quot;.

=== Influence ===

==== Economic and regional influence ====
The fair was credited with increasing tourism in New York City, even before the formal opening. The city&#x27;s hotels and garages were often overcrowded during the fair&#x27;s 1964 season. Broadway theaters recorded increased ticket sales, as did other visitor attractions such as the Empire State Building and Radio City Music Hall. Though major department stores and restaurants saw increased business, other merchants reported the fair had not had a measurable effect on their businesses. To avoid crowds, many residents left the city during the fair. Attendance at local amusement parks declined during the fair and some parks, such as Freedomland U.S.A., permanently closed.

At the end of the 1964 season, the city&#x27;s Convention and Visitors Bureau estimated the city had earned $400 million due to the fair. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote in 1965 the fair had only partially benefited the area&#x27;s economy. After the fair ended, &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated it had increased local restaurant profits by eight percent, while stores in Midtown Manhattan saw their profits increase by approximately four percent. The highways leading to the fairground remained in use after the fair&#x27;s closure, and residential development in Queens increased.

==== Cultural influence and media ====
At the fair&#x27;s 50th anniversary, a writer for &quot;amNewYork Metro&quot; wrote it helped influence 21st-century technologies and highlighted Flushing Meadows–Corona Park as an attraction in itself. The fair helped popularize several consumer products such as Belgian waffles and the Ford Mustang. The 1964 World&#x27;s Fair included several exhibits and technologies that were later included in Disney parks; for example, the Illinois Pavilion&#x27;s Audio-Animatronic of Abraham Lincoln was so popular Audio-Animatronics were later added to many Disney rides. Walt Disney designed exhibits at the World&#x27;s Fair; It&#x27;s a Small World, the Progressland carousel, and the Magic Skyway were later incorporated into Disney parks.

The fair has been the subject of documentary films such as &quot;The 1964 World&#x27;s Fair&quot; (1996), &quot;After the Fair&quot; (2014), and &quot;Peace Through Understanding: The 1964–65 New York World&#x27;s Fair&quot;. The fair and its structures have been depicted in popular media; for example, the New York State Pavilion and the Unisphere appear in the films &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;. Historians have created websites and written books about the fair. The fair has been the subject of several exhibitions at venues including the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts, Queens Museum, Flushing Town Hall, and the Long Island Museum of American Art, History, and Carriages. The fair&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2014 was celebrated with six months of parties, exhibits, and other events across Queens.

Hobbyists have collected memorabilia from the fair, and several collectors have founded the World&#x27;s Fair Collectors Society. Collectors have preserved objects such as bracelets, medallions, ponchos, purses, and pocketknives. The Smithsonian Institution and Queens Museum also own objects from the World&#x27;s Fair, and there have been efforts to develop a World&#x27;s Fair museum.

<doc id="99443" wikidata="Q986007" url="?curid=99443" title="Lowestoft">
<text>Lowestoft ( ) is a coastal town and civil parish in the East Suffolk district of Suffolk, England. As the most easterly UK settlement, it is north-east of Ipswich and south-east of Norwich, and the main town in its district. Its development grew with the fishing industry and as a seaside resort with wide sandy beaches. As fishing declined, oil and gas exploitation in the North Sea in the 1960s took over. In 2021 the built-up area had a population of 71,327 and the parish had a population of 47,879.

==History==
Some of the earliest signs of settlement in Britain have been found here. Flint tools discovered in the Pakefield cliffs of south Lowestoft in 2005 allow human habitation of the area to be traced back 700,000 years.

Habitation occurred in the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron ages and in the Roman and Saxon times. Several finds have been made at a Saxon cemetery at Bloodmoor Hill in south Lowestoft. The place name derives from a Norse personal name, &quot;Hlothver&quot;, and &quot;toft&quot;, an Old Norse word for homestead. It has been spelt historically as &quot;Lothnwistoft&quot;, &quot;Lothuwistoft&quot;, &quot;Lestoffe&quot;, &quot;Laistoe&quot;, &quot;Loystoft&quot; and &quot;Laystoft&quot;.

The 1086 Domesday Book gives Lothuwistoft village some 16 households in three families, with ten smallholders and three slaves. The manor formed part of the king&#x27;s holding in the Hundred of Lothingland, worth about four geld in tax income. Roger Bigod was the tenant in chief. The lost village of Akethorpe may have lain close by.

In the Middle Ages, Lowestoft became an important fishing town that came to challenge its neighbour, Great Yarmouth. The trade, particularly for herring, continued as the town&#x27;s main identity into the 20th century.

The naval Battle of Lowestoft in June 1665 was the first in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Held off the coast, it was a victory for the English.

Lowestoft Porcelain Factory, from 1757 to 1802, was in production for longer than any English soft-paste porcelain manufacturer other than Royal Worcester and Royal Crown Derby, producing domestic pots, teapots and jugs. It stood on the site of an existing pottery or brick kiln and was later used as a brewery and malt kiln. Most of its remaining buildings were demolished in 1955.
Sir Samuel Morton Peto&#x27;s arrival in 19th-century Lowestoft brought a change in the town&#x27;s fortunes, including its fishing industry. To help stimulate this, Peto was given the task of building a line for the Lowestoft Railway and Harbour Company, connecting with Reedham and the city of Norwich. This had a profound impact on the town&#x27;s industrial development – its fishing fleets could sell to markets further inland, and other industries such as engineering gained from increased trade with the continent. Peto&#x27;s railway enabled Lowestoft to become a flourishing seaside holiday resort; much of Peto&#x27;s seaside resort in south Lowestoft still exists, including the Grade II listed Kirkley Cliff and Wellington Esplanade terraces.

During World War I, Lowestoft was bombarded by the German Navy on 24 April 1916 in conjunction with the Easter Rising. The port was a major naval base during the war, including for armed trawlers such as &quot;Ethel &amp; Millie&quot; and &quot;Nelson&quot; used to combat German U-boat actions in the North Sea such as that of 15 August 1917. In World War II the town was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe for its engineering industry and role as a naval base. It is sometimes placed among the UK&#x27;s most heavily bombed towns per head of population. The Royal Naval Patrol Service was mobilised in August 1939, mainly by trawlermen and fishermen of the Royal Naval Reserve. Its depot, &quot;HMS Europa&quot;, was also known locally as the &quot;Sparrow&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

==Governance==
Lowestoft is the major settlement in the East Suffolk district. In 1885 Lowestoft became a municipal borough which became part of the administrative county of East Suffolk in 1889, the district contained the parish of Lowestoft, from 1890 to 1907 the district also contained the parish of Kirkley. On 1 April 1974 the district and parish were abolished and became part of Waveney in the non-metropolitan county of Suffolk. It retained a ceremonial mayor elected annually by its district councillors and acting as charter trustees until 2017. Suffolk County Council is the county authority. A civil parish of Lowestoft was created on 1 April 2017, governed by Lowestoft Town Council, which elects a town mayor annually.

The town is part of the Lowestoft parliamentary constituency.

Before 1 April 2019, Lowestoft, as part of Waveney District Council, was divided into ten electoral wards, with Carlton Colville treated as a separate electoral area. Harbour, Kirkley, Normanston, Pakefield, St Margarets and Whitton wards elected three councillors each, and Carlton, Gunton and Corton, Oulton and Oulton Broad wards two. Of the 48 council seats in the district, 26 represented wards within Lowestoft and three were in Carlton Colville. In 2010 the council changed to a system of all seats being elected every four years.

On 1 April 2019, governance arrangements for Lowestoft changed with the merger of Waveney and Suffolk Coastal District Councils to form a new district council of East Suffolk. Elections were held on 2 May 2019 for the six new Lowestoft wards. The seats, fourteen in all, are allocated to Carlton and Whitton (2), Gunton and St. Margarets (2), Harbour and Normanston (3), Kirkley and Pakefield (3), Lothingland (1), and Oulton Broad (3). There are also changes to wards adjacent to Lowestoft. After the inaugural 2019 East Suffolk District Council election of 2 May, eight of the fourteen Lowestoft seats over the six new wards went to the Conservatives and six to Labour.

On Suffolk County Council, Lowestoft and its district are represented by eight councillors, split equally between four divisions: Gunton, Lowestoft South, Oulton and Pakefield. For county council elections, held every four years, Pakefield division includes Carlton Colville. After the 2017 election, seven of Lowestoft&#x27;s county councillors represented the Conservatives and one Labour. In 2018, one Conservative councillor left the party and became an Independent.

==Geography and climate==

Lowestoft, the easternmost town in the United Kingdom, lies on the North Sea coast. The town is divided by Lake Lothing, which forms the inner part of Lowestoft Harbour and gives access via Oulton Broad and Oulton Dyke to the River Waveney and the Broads. The northern half is on the island of Lothingland.

Lowestoft is mainly low-lying, with hilly areas in the north and high points of above sea level. The rock beneath is crag-sand with overlying sand and glacial till deposits with gravel, with the crag exposed at coastal cliffs such as Pakefield&#x27;s. Areas around Lake Lothing feature alluvium silt; some marshland remains west of Oulton Broad. The sandy beaches south of the harbour have Blue Flag status. To the north of the harbour is an area of old sand dunes known as the Denes, along with more beaches and Ness Point, the easternmost point of the UK.

Lowestoft has been subject to periodic flooding, notably in January 1953, when a North Sea swell driven by low pressure and an extreme high tide swept away many earlier sea defences and deluged most of the southern town. Heavy rain caused flash flooding in the town in September 2006. In December 2013, a storm surge caused severe flooding of Lowestoft and its suburbs.

Lowestoft is among the UK&#x27;s driest areas: annual rainfall averages under 600 mm distributed fairly evenly through the year. Mean daily summer temperatures peak at 21 °C in August, when the town averages over 200 hours of sunshine, while in winter minima average 2 °C. Marked snowfall is rare. Sea fog and cool onshore breezes can affect the town.

==Demography==
Lowestoft is Suffolk&#x27;s second largest town, after Ipswich, with an estimated population of 58,560 in 2010. The wider urban area brought the estimated population of the built-up area to 73,755 in 2018 from 68,850 at the 2001 census. The town&#x27;s wider urban area includes the suburbs and villages of Carlton Colville, Gunton, Pakefield, Oulton, Oulton Broad and Kirkley. Other outlying villages in the urban area include Blundeston, Corton, Gisleham, Kessingland and Somerleyton.

About 10 per cent of the area population at the 2001 census was aged 75 or over and 20 per cent under 16. In general the population of several wards is slightly skewed towards the elderly. The population is mainly classed as &quot;white&quot;, with minority ethnicities making up 1.4 per cent, compared with 8.7 per cent nationally.

At the 2001 census there were 27,777 households, giving an average household size of 2.40. In total 8,430 (30 per cent) were classified as one-person households, while 26 per cent included children aged 15 or under. The proportion of households without a private car was 29 per cent, whilst 22 per cent had two or more. In housing tenure, 72 per cent of homes were owner-occupied.

==Economy==
Originally based on fishing and engineering, the economy of Lowestoft has declined over the years. Although the tourism sector has grown, the major employers in the town are the wholesale and retail sector, with 18 per cent of employment. 
Service industries, including health, social care and education are significant employers, while manufacturing employs about 10 per cent of the workforce.

Employment can vary seasonally due to the importance of tourism to the economy. In early 2011, around 10 per cent of the working population of the town claimed Jobseekers Allowance.

===Traditional industries===

Until the mid-1960s, fishing was seen as Lowestoft&#x27;s main industry, although from the 1930s the percentage so employed directly and in trades associated with fishing was actually only about 10 per cent. Fleets of drifters and trawlers caught fish such as herring, cod and plaice. Catches have diminished since the 1960s and although 100 boats remained by the 1980s, there are now only a few small boats operating out of Lowestoft, with no large trawlers. By 2011 just three traders remained at the town&#x27;s fish market, which is under threat of closure due to redevelopment of the port. The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), a large fisheries research centre that is a part of Defra, is still located in Lowestoft.

Other major traditional employers included Eastern Coach Works and engineering and shipbuilding companies clustered around the harbour. These included the Brooke Marine and Richards shipbuilding companies, which together employed over a thousand men but went out of business in the 1990s, and the Norwich-based engineering company Boulton and Paul. Some shipbuilding and repair still goes on at the harbour.

===Modern economy===

Major local employers include Birds Eye frozen foods, with 700 workers. This has been located in the town for over 60 years. The food-processing company Wessex Foods closed its Lowestoft plant in 2010 after a fire destroyed the factory and it failed to find alternative premises.

Several other employers have shed labour in recent years. The Sanyo plant in the town closed down in 2009 with a loss of 60 jobs, having once employed 800. The timber company Jeld-Wen closed its factory in the town in 2010.

From the mid-1960s to the late 1990s, the oil and gas industry provided significant employment in the area. For many years the Shell Southern Operations base on the north shore of Lowestoft Harbour was town&#x27;s largest employer. A decision to close the Shell base was finally made in 2003. Oil and gas is still a major industry.

The town has made efforts to develop as a centre for renewable energy in the east of England. The non-profit Orbis Energy centre has been set up to draw business in the green-energy sector and features solar thermal heating. In April 2009, Associated British Ports announced that the harbour is to become the operations centre for the 500 MW Greater Gabbard wind farm, which when completed will be the world&#x27;s largest offshore windfarm. The turbines will be located off the Suffolk coast and the Outer Harbour will be used to house the necessary operational support facilities. Other developments in the renewable energy sector include a prototype tidal energy generator being produced by local company 4NRG and wave power systems developed by Trident Energy.

Hoseasons (now part of Awaze), a specialist in self-catering UK holidays, is also a large employment provider.

===Retailing===
The town centre is the main shopping area in Waveney district. The retail chain Marks &amp; Spencer has a store. Chadds independent department store was founded in 1907, and after nearly 100 years trading in the High Street, was taken over in 2004 by the Great Yarmouth-based Palmers group. Specialist shopping areas, branded as The Historic High Street and the Triangle Market Place, have been developed on the northern edge of the centre. Several retail parks have appeared, the largest being North Quay Retail Park in Peto Way.

Lowestoft is a traditional seaside resort, first developed as a bathing site in the 1760s. The coast has been called the &quot;Sunrise Coast&quot;. The town&#x27;s main beaches are south of the harbour, where two piers, the Claremont and South piers, provide tourist facilities, and the East Point Pavilion the tourist information service. The beach south of the Claremont Pier is a Blue Flag beach. Lifeguard facilities are provided during the summer and water sports take place along the coast. Tourism is a significant aspect of the town&#x27;s economy.

The town features two major attractions, the first being Pleasurewood Hills Theme Park, situated on the northern edge of the town, while the second is the Africa Alive! wildlife park, situated in the south at Kessingland. The town maintains a holiday park at Pakefield, operated by Pontins, and a small caravan site near its northern beach. The natural attractions of the Broads and the River Waveney on the west edge of the town, also attract visitors and been the site for boat trips and water sports events, with companies such as Hoseasons operating hire boats from Oulton Broad.

Between 1996 and 2012, the town hosted a major air show during the summer, dubbed the Lowestoft Airshow. A major attraction, the two-day event took place in August, and featuring a wide range of aircraft including the Red Arrows, a Lancaster bomber, Spitfires and an Avro Vulcan. From 2004, it was run by Lowestoft Seafront Air Festival Ltd, a non-profit company, but suffered financial difficulties. In 2010, the event made a loss of £40,000 and raised concerns over its sustainability, whereupon further financial difficulties coupled with bad weather and low visitor numbers made the 2012 airshow the last before it was discontinued.

Near the town centre is Lowestoft Maritime Museum, open from late April to late October, which has exhibits of maritime artefacts, an extensive collection of ship models and medals, marine art, fishing and the fishing industry, activities with the Royal Navy in WWII, and shipwrights&#x27; and coopers&#x27; tools.

===Redevelopment===

Lowestoft is among the more socially deprived areas in Suffolk, with Kirkley the county&#x27;s most deprived ward, ranking 173rd most deprived in England out of 32,486. The area attracted European Union redevelopment funding. The Waveney Sunrise Scheme invested £14.7 million, funding transport improvements and tourist facilities such as fountains on Royal Plain, as stimulants. Regeneration company 1st East, which focused on the Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth areas, closed in 2011.

Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone was announced in 2011 and launched in April 2012. The zone, developed by New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership, has six redevelopment sites across Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth. The bid for the zone in 2011 envisaged creating 13,500 jobs by 2036. It involved the Norfolk and Suffolk Energy Alliance and focused on developing the energy sector initially using tax incentives, simplified planning regulations and the provision of improved broadband internet services. The sites in Lowestoft are Mobbs Way, Riverside Road and South Lowestoft Industrial Estate.

Associated British Ports, the operator of the Port of Lowestoft, published their Lowestoft Masterplan, which aims to regenerate the harbour and take advantage of renewable energy, including the new Lowestoft Eastern Energy Facility (LEEF) on the former SLP land at the outer harbour amongst other projects. The harbour is a focus of redevelopment proposals for Lowestoft through the Lake Lothing and Outer Harbour Area Action Plan, submitted in February 2011. The plan focuses on the redevelopment of brownfield sites in and around the harbour area to create jobs, particularly in the renewable energy and retailing sectors.

==Culture and community==
The town has three theatres: the Marina, the Players (Lowestoft) and The Seagull. The 800-seat Marina, operated as a charitable trust, was restored and refurbished in 2012 and its cinema upgraded to digital in 2013. A small four-screen cinema, the independently owned East Coast Cinema, underwent modest refurbishment in late 2011 to upgrade facilities and allow 3D films to be shown. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra has played regularly at the Marina Theatre since 2005.

Lowestoft Museum, which holds a collection of Lowestoft Porcelain and artifacts describing the town&#x27;s history, is in Nicholas Everett Park in Oulton Broad. There are some small museums in Sparrow&#x27;s Nest Park in the north of the town, including the Lowestoft War Memorial Museum, the Maritime Museum and the Royal Naval Patrol Service Museum. The Heritage Workshop Centre is also located there. The &quot;Mincarlo&quot;, the last surviving sidewinder trawler of the Lowestoft fishing fleet, can be visited at Lowestoft Harbour. The East Anglia Transport Museum holds a collection of buses, trams and trolleybuses in Carlton Colville.
Lowestoft retains several narrow lanes with steps running steeply seawards, known locally as &quot;scores&quot;. They were used by fishermen and smugglers and now feature in an annual charity race. The borough church, dedicated to St Margaret, is a Grade I listed building. In the town centre is Our Lady Star of the Sea Church, a Grade II listed building in the Arts and Crafts style and the most easterly Catholic church in the British Isles.

Lowestoft&#x27;s town-centre library contains a local-history section and a branch of the Suffolk Record Office. Lowestoft Hospital closed in 2016. Services are now provided by the James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston. The main burial grounds for the town are Lowestoft Cemetery and Kirkley Cemetery. The town is twinned with the town of Plaisir in the Yvelines department in the Île-de-France to the west of Paris.

==Landmarks==

=== Ness Point ===
Ness Point, the most easterly location in the United Kingdom, is located in the town close to a 126-metre wind turbine, known locally as Gulliver. At the time it was completed it was the country&#x27;s tallest.

At the most easterly point is a large compass rose, the &quot;Euroscope&quot;, set in the ground to give the direction and distance to various cities in Europe.

=== Sparrows Nest ===
Belle Vue Park (Sparrows Nest) is the site of the Royal Naval Patrol Service memorial. The central depot for the service was in Lowestoft when it was mobilised in August 1939, on a site known as Sparrow&#x27;s Nest, adjacent to the memorial. The memorial has the names of the 2,385 members of the service who died in World War II. Prior to this, it was the site of the &quot;North Battery&quot;, which stood on the cliff and was constructed in around 1782. It was a four sided bastion set back from the cliff edge, housing four 18-pounder canon, with a guardhouse and magazine to the rear. All traces are now gone, minus two cannons with are now mounted around the memorial.

===Lighthouse===
Lowestoft Lighthouse, built in 1874 to the north of the town centre, stands 16 metres high at 37 metres above sea level, with a range of . It was automated in 1975. It is the United Kingdom&#x27;s most easterly lighthouse.

The first two lighthouses in Lowestoft were built in 1609 on the foreshore and candlelit, to warn of the dangerous sandbanks around the coast. These were the first constructed by Trinity House. The Low Light was discontinued in 1706 after sea encroachment, but re-established in 1730 in a form that could be easily moved in response to further changes to the Stamford Channel and shoreline. It was discontinued in August 1923. The High Light tower was rebuilt as the present lighthouse in 1874 with the intention of displaying an electric light, but when opened paraffin oil was used instead; not until 1936 was it electrified. The lighthouse, with two cottages originally for lighthouse keepers, is a Grade II listed building.

A second remaining lighthouse can be found on the coast of Pakefield, south of Lowestoft between Pakefield and the Village of Kessingland. Originally constructed in 1831 and decommissioned in 1864, Pakefield lighthouse is now looked after by volunteers from Pakefield Coastwatch, who operate it as a coastal surveillance station. 

===Lifeboat station===

Lowestoft Lifeboat Station, at the mouth of the outer harbour at the South Pier, is one of Britain&#x27;s oldest, founded in 1801 and open to visitors throughout the year. The lifeboat is &quot;Patsy Knight&quot;, a Shannon class lifeboat which replaced the Tyne class boat &quot;Spirit of Lowestoft&quot; in 2014. A former Lowestoft lifeboat was used during the Dunkirk evacuation of British forces from France in 1940. The South Broads Lifeboat Station, an inland RNLI station, operated at Oulton Broad in 2001–2011.

===Town Hall===
Lowestoft Town Hall stands in the High Street. Various forms of local government have met or been based on this site since its establishment as a Town House and Chapel in 1570. In 1698 a new Town House was built, incorporating a corn cross on the ground floor with the meeting chamber and chapel above. This in turn was replaced by the present building, designed by architect J. L. Clemence in 1857. The building houses the town clock and the curfew bell, which dates from 1644 and is rung each evening at 8 p. m. The building is a Grade II listed building.

In 2012, Waveney District Council announced that it planned to leave the town hall and share Suffolk County Council&#x27;s offices in Riverside Road. This occurred in 2015.
===Gull Wing Bridge===

The Gull Wing Bridge is a rolling bascule bridge that spans Lake Lothing in the town of Lowestoft, Suffolk, England, and is the largest bridge of its kind in the world to date.

The bridge&#x27;s surface consists of a two-lane single carriageway with pedestrian and cycle footpaths on both sides. The bridge maintains a speed limit of for road traffic.

The bascule span of the bridge, which opens up southwards when required, lies around above water level during high tides, with the space between the two main spans in the water being around - safety features fitted to the span walls limit shipping with a maximum width of to be able to pass through its channel. The Northern Approach Viaduct (NAV) has ground clearance of around over the railway line to station for trains. Road access in the south is via Waveney Drive, while in the north it is via Peto Way and Denmark Road.

==Transport==

Lowestoft railway station, originally Lowestoft Central, is centrally placed within walking distance of the beach and the town centre. It provides services to Ipswich on the East Suffolk Line and to Norwich on the Wherry Line. Both lines were originally part of the Great Eastern Railway and are operated by Greater Anglia. The suburb of Oulton Broad has two stations: lies on the line to , while is on the line to .

, originally operated by the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway, closed in 1970 with the Lowestoft to Great Yarmouth line. The site is now taken by the residential Beeching Drive.

National Express Coaches stop in Lowestoft on the London–Great Yarmouth route.

The main A12 road to London passes through Carlton Colville, Pakefield and Kirkley in the southern area of Lowestoft, ending at the town&#x27;s harbour Bascule Bridge. It connects there to the A47 road, which runs around the centre of town, before exiting along Great Yarmouth Road, crossing the county border into Norfolk.

A second road from the town centre, the A1044, links the town to Oulton Broad, via its second road crossing over Lake Lothing, and connects with the A146 that runs between Lowestoft, Beccles and Norwich. Both bridges can be raised if vessels need to pass through the harbour and Lake Lothing, though this can cause congestion in the town and routes can become gridlocked. a third crossing of Lowestoft Harbour is under construction. A southern relief road was built to divert traffic from the seafront, while a proposed pedestrian and cycle bridge is planned as an alternative crossing alongside the Bascule Bridge.

Lowestoft&#x27;s cycle network has routes that link areas to the town centre. About 12 per cent of residents cycle to work. The town is seen as &quot;ideally suited&quot; to cycling due to its relatively small size and flat landscape. Suffolk County Council aims to promote cycling by working with employers and schools and by funding a town-centre pedestrian and cycle bridge.

<text>Dilham is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk.

The village is located south-east of North Walsham and north-east of Norwich, along the course of the River Ant.

==History==
Dilham&#x27;s name is of Anglo-Saxon origin, and derives from the Old English for a farmstead or homestead with an abundance of dill.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, Dilham is listed as a settlement of 23 households in the hundred of Tunstead. In 1086, the village was divided between the estates of Alan of Brittany, Robert Malet, Roger Bigod and St Benet&#x27;s Abbey.

Nearby Dilham Castle was built in the fifteenth century as a fortified manor house for Sir Henry Inglose; all that remains of the castle is the Grade II listed tower currently attached to Hall Farm.

During the Second World War, the North Walsham and Dilham Canal was designated as a line of defence against a possible German invasion which meant that bunkers, barbed wire and mortar-emplacements were built in the parish.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census, Dilham has a population of 331 people which shows a small increase from the 319 people recorded in the 2011 census.

Dilham marks the limit of Broads navigation for larger boats, but smaller boats can continue on the North Walsham and Dilham Canal until Honing.

==St. Nicholas&#x27; Church==
Dilham&#x27;s parish church is dedicated to Saint Nicholas and was re-built in the 1930s. St. Nicholas&#x27; is located outside of the village on Church Road.

== Governance ==
Dilham is part of the electoral ward of Hoveton &amp; Tunstead for local elections and is part of the district of North Norfolk.

The village&#x27;s national constituency is North Norfolk, which has been represented by the Liberal Democrat Steff Aquarone MP since 2024.

==War Memorial==
Dilham&#x27;s war memorials are two marble plaques inside St. Nicholas&#x27; Church. The memorials list the following names for the First World War:

And, the following for the Second World War:

<doc id="99446" wikidata="Q313791" url="?curid=99446" title="Ephorus">
<text>Ephorus of Cyme (; , &quot;Ephoros ho Kymaios&quot;; 330 BC) was an ancient Greek historian known for his universal history, now lost.

==Biography==
Information on his biography is limited. He was born in Cyme, Aeolia, and together with the historian Theopompus was a pupil of Isocrates in rhetoric. He does not seem to have made much progress as a speaker, and at the suggestion of Isocrates himself he took up literary composition and the study of history. According to Plutarch, Ephorus declined Alexander the Great&#x27;s offer to join him on his Persian campaign as the official historiographer. His son Demophilus followed in his footsteps as a historian.

==Main works==
Ephorus&#x27; &quot;magnum opus&quot; was a set of 29 books recounting a universal history. The whole work, edited by his son Demophilus—who added a 30th book—contained a summary description of the Sacred Wars, along with other narratives from the days of the Heraclids up until the taking of Perinthus in 340 BC by Philip of Macedon, covering a time span of more than seven hundred years. According to Polybius, Ephorus was the first historian to ever author a universal history. For each of the 29 separate books, Ephorus wrote a &quot;prooimion&quot;. The work was probably simply named &quot;Historiai&quot;, and followed a thematic, rather than a strictly chronological order in its narrative. These writings are generally believed to be the main or sole source for Diodorus Siculus&#x27; account of the history of Greece between 480 and 340 BC, which is one of only two continuous narratives of this period that survive.

It is clear that Ephorus made critical use of the best authorities. His history was highly praised and read in antiquity, and later ancient historians freely drew upon his work. Large parts of the history of Diodorus Siculus may have originated in Ephorus&#x27;s history. Strabo attached much importance to Ephorus&#x27;s geographical investigations, and praised him for being the first to separate the historical from the simply geographical element. In his &quot;Geographica&quot;, Strabo quoted Ephorus at length. Polybius, while crediting him with a knowledge of the conditions of naval warfare, ridiculed his description of the 362 BCE Battle of Mantinea as showing ignorance of the nature of land operations.

==Additional works==

Besides the universal history, Ephorus wrote an &quot;Epichorios logos&quot; (Ἐπιχώριος λόγος), a patriotic essay in which he praised the traditions of Cyme. He also wrote &quot;Peri heurematon&quot; (Περὶ εὑρημάτων), a book about inventions, and (Περὶ λέξεως), &quot;On Style&quot;. 
Other works attributed to him were:

* &quot;A Treatise on Discoveries&quot;
* &quot;Respecting Good and Evil Things&quot;
* &quot;The Remarkable Recipes&quot;
* &quot;On Remarkable Things in Various Countries&quot; (it is doubtful whether these were separate works, or just extracts from the Histories)
* &quot;A Treatise on my Country&quot;, on the history and antiquities of Cyme
* &quot;The Book of Goodness&quot;, his manual on achieving happiness and pleasing others.
* &quot;An Essay on Style&quot;, his only rhetorical work, which is occasionally mentioned by the rhetorician Theon (rhetorician).
Despite having written all these works, nothing but isolated fragments survived from the ancient world. His entire work has been lost.

==Critiques==

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, his surviving writings all show a certain lack of passion, in spite of his keen interest in matters of style, and of political partisanship, except for his enthusiasm for Cyme. According to ancient writers, he was respected as an able and thorough, though somewhat dull historiographer. He was commended for drawing (though not always) a sharp line of demarcation between the mythical and historical; he even recognized that a profusion of detail, though lending corroborative force to accounts of recent events, is ground for suspicion, in reports of far-distant history. His style was high-flown and artificial, as was natural considering his early training, and he frequently sacrificed truth to rhetoric effect. However, according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, he and Theopompus were the only historical writers whose language was accurate and complete.

== Ephorus and astronomy ==

Ephorus reported that a comet split apart as far back as the winter of 372–373 BC.

The Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger, whose &quot;Naturales quaestiones&quot; is the ancient source for Ephorus&#x27;s comet report, is severe in his judgment (7.16):

<text>Theopompus (, &quot;Theópompos&quot;; 380 BC 315 BC) was an ancient Greek historian and rhetorician who was a student of Isocrates. 

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
Theopompus was born on the Aegean island of Chios in 378 or 377 BCE. In his early youth, he seems to have spent some time at Athens, with his father Damasistratus, who had been exiled for his Laconian sympathies. In Athens, he became a pupil of Isocrates, and rapidly made progress in rhetoric; we are told that Isocrates used to say that Ephorus required the spur but Theopompus the bit.

At first he appears to have composed epideictic speeches, in which he attained to such proficiency that in 352–351 BC he gained the prize of oratory given by Artemisia II of Caria in honour of her husband, although Isocrates was himself among the competitors. It is said to have been the advice of his teacher that finally determined his career as an historian—a career for which he was peculiarly qualified owing to his abundant patrimony and his wide knowledge of men and places. Through the influence of Alexander III, he was permitted to return to Chios around 333 BC, and figured for some time as one of the leaders of the aristocratic party in his native town. After Alexander&#x27;s death, he was again expelled, and took refuge with Ptolemy in Egypt, where he appears to have met with a somewhat cold reception. The exact date of his death isn&#x27;t know, but scholars have placed it around 320 BC.

==Career and Works==
The works of Theopompus were chiefly historical, and are much quoted by later writers. They included an &quot;Epitome&quot; of Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot; (whether this work is actually his is debated), the &quot;Hellenica&quot; (Ἑλληνικά), the &quot;History of Philip&quot;, and several panegyrics and hortatory addresses, the chief of which was the &quot;Letter to Alexander&quot;.

===The &quot;Hellenica&quot;===
The &quot;Hellenica&quot; treated of the history of Greece, in twelve books, from 411 BC (where Thucydides breaks off) to 394 BC — the date of the Battle of Cnidus. Of this work, only a few fragments were known up till 1907. The &quot;papyrus fragment&quot; of a Greek historian of the 4th century BC, discovered by B. P. Grenfell and A. S. Hunt, and published by them in &quot;Oxyrhynchus Papyri&quot; (Vol. 5, 1908), has been recognized by Eduard Meyer, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff and Georg Busolt as a portion of the &quot;Hellenica&quot;. This identification has been disputed, however, by Friedrich Blass, J. B. Bury, and others, most of whom attribute the fragment, which deals with the events of the year 395 BC and is of considerable extent, to Cratippus.

===History of Philip II===
Theopompus&#x27;s most significant work, the &quot;Philippica,&quot; consisted of fifty-eight books which detailed the reign of Philip II of Macedon. Despite its fragmented state modern scholarship offers insights into its themes and Theopompus&#x27;s historiographical approach. Unlike many of his peers, Theopompus offered a nuanced portrayal of Philip. He depicts him not merely as a conqueror but as a figure whose reign brought about significant moral and social destruction. The &quot;Philippica&quot; was more than a historical record. It is moral commentary on the corruption of Philips court. Theopompus criticizes the moral decline which accompanied Philip&#x27;s expansionist policies. He&#x27;d draw parallels between personal vices of individuals and the larger societal corruption. Also, he detailed accounts of various regions and their political and social conditions. By doing so, he could share his belief in the interconnectedness of moral and political decay in different societies.

A far more elaborate work was the history of Philip&#x27;s reign (360–336 BC), with digressions on the names and customs of the various races and countries of which he had occasion to speak, which were so numerous that Philip V of Macedon reduced the bulk of the history from 58 to 16 books by cutting out those parts which had no connection with Macedonia. It was from this history that Trogus Pompeius (of whose &quot;Historiae Philippicae&quot; we possess the epitome by Justin) derived much of his material. Fifty-three books were extant in the time of Photius (9th century), who read them, and has left us an epitome of the 12th book. Several fragments, chiefly anecdotes and strictures of various kinds upon the character of nations and individuals, are preserved by Athenaeus, Plutarch and others. Of the &quot;Letter to Alexander&quot; we possess one or two fragments cited by Athenaeus, criticizing severely the immorality and dissipations of Harpalus.

The artistic unity of his work suffered severely from the frequent and lengthy digressions, of which the most important was &quot;On the Athenian Demagogues&quot; in the 10th book of the &quot;Philippica&quot;, containing a bitter attack on many of the chief Athenian statesmen, and generally recognized as having been freely used by Plutarch in several of the Lives. The &quot;&quot; is a lengthy digression inserted into books 8 and 9.

Another fault of Theopompus was his excessive fondness for romantic and incredible stories; a collection of some of these was afterwards made and published under his name. He was also severely blamed in antiquity for his censoriousness, and throughout his fragments no feature is more striking than this. On the whole, however, he appears to have been fairly impartial. Theompopus censures Philip severely for drunkenness and immorality while warmly praising Demosthenes.

==Mention by others==
Aristotle mentions the conception and testimony of Theopompus about the inequity of slavery, in &quot;Politics&quot;. Jewish historian Flavius Josephus writes that Demetrius of Phalerum, in response to Ptolemy II Philadelphus asking why the Jewish Law had not been mentioned by any of his scribes or poets, told that due to the divine nature of the documents, any who endeavored to write about it had been afflicted by a distemper. He continued, saying that Theopompus once endeavored to write about the Jewish Law, but became disturbed in his mind for 30 days, whereupon during some intermission of his distemper he prayed for healing and determined to leave off his attempt to write, and was cured thereby. A passage from Theopompus is given by Athenaeus in his Deipnosophistae. Claudius Aelianus quotes both Theopompus and Lycus of Rhegium as sources on the cult practices of the Adriatic Veneti.

== Modern Scholarship ==
Modern scholarship by historians such as Gordon Shrimpton and W. Robert Connor have re-evaluated Theopompus&#x27;s contributions to historiography. Shrimpton emphasizes Theopompus&#x27;s refined portrayal of Phillip II. He argues that Theopompus&#x27;s work reflected a sophisticated understanding of the nuances of power and corruption. Connor highlights Theopompus&#x27;s disillusionment with the moral state of Greece. This presents him as a critical observer and recorder of society.

Riccardo Vattoune&#x27;s analysis further examines Theopompus&#x27;s innovations in methodology. The chapter explores how Theopompus approached writing of history, specifically his use of sources and his treatment of historical events. One key aspect discussed is Theopompus&#x27;s interest in &quot;invisible&quot; parts of history such as motivations, emotions, and character traits. These parts of history aren&#x27;t readily apparent from the historical record alone, but his work preserves that part of history. Additionally, Vattuone dives into Theopompus&#x27;s use of speeches, anecdotes, and character sketch&#x27;s to give life to these invisible parts of history. Overall, the chapter provides insight into Theopompus&#x27;s innovations in the field of historiography.

<text>Patton is a 1970 American epic biographical war film about U.S. General George S. Patton during World War II. It stars George C. Scott as Patton and Karl Malden as General Omar Bradley, and was directed by Franklin J. Schaffner from a script by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, who based their screenplay on &quot;Patton: Ordeal and Triumph&quot; by Ladislas Farago and Bradley&#x27;s memoir, &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot;.

&quot;Patton&quot; won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Scott also won the Best Actor for his performance, though he declined the award. The opening monologue, delivered by Scott as General Patton with an enormous American flag behind him, remains an iconic and often quoted image in film. In 2003, &quot;Patton&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. The Academy Film Archive also preserved &quot;Patton&quot; in 2003.

==Plot==
During World War II, in its first combat encounter with the German Afrika Korps at the Battle of Kasserine Pass, the II Corps is defeated by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. General George S. Patton is placed in command of II Corps and begins instilling his authority amongst his untested and poorly disciplined troops. Alongside the poor condition of American soldiers in the II Corps, Patton identifies how his British counterpart, General Bernard Montgomery, is monopolising the allied effort to suit his own needs.

The Allied victory in North Africa prompts Patton and Montgomery to come up with competing plans for the Allied invasion of Sicily. Patton&#x27;s plan highlights the strategic importance of Syracuse; hypothesising that its fall would trigger an evacuation of Sicily. Patton proposes that Montgomery captures Syracuse, whereas he will land near Palermo and then capture Messina to cut off the withdrawal. Though the plan impresses General Harold Alexander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower turns it down in favour of Montgomery&#x27;s more cautious plan that has both armies landing side-by-side, Patton in the Gulf of Gela and Montgomery on the eastern side of Sicily. With the Allies bogged down in the south-east corner of Sicily, Patton drives west and captures Palermo before beating Montgomery to Messina. Though his advance breaks the deadlock in Sicily, his aggression does not sit well with his subordinates Omar Bradley and Lucian Truscott. When the allies liberate Syracuse, the evacuation predicted by Patton proves correct, but without allied forces in the north, thousands of Italian and German forces retreat. During a visit to a field hospital, Patton notices a soldier crying amongst the wounded and dead. Furious, he accuses the him of cowardice and slaps him before demanding that he is returned to the front lines. Eisenhower demands that Patton apologize to the soldier and his entire command, which he reluctantly does.

Despite apologizing, he is sidelined for the coming Allied invasion of France and instead placed in command of the fictitious First United States Army Group as a decoy in London, the Allied command confident in that keeping Patton in England will tell the Germans that he will lead the invasion of Europe. To a public gathering in the town of Knutsford, Patton remarks that the post-war world will be dominated by the British-American spheres of influence; this comment is viewed as a slight to the Soviet Union. Despite Patton&#x27;s protest that he has done nothing wrong, the situation has spiraled from his control, and the decision to send him home or remain in England is placed on General George Marshall. Though not present for the Normandy invasion, Patton is given command of the Third Army reporting to General Bradley, his former subordinate. Under his leadership, the Third Army sweeps across France, but it is brought to a halt just before entering Germany, because gasoline and other vital supplies have been instead allocated to Montgomery&#x27;s Operation Market Garden. Frustrated at being sidelined to appease Montgomery, Patton demands to know why he was given a command if he cannot advance. Bradley retorts that it was actually Eisenhower&#x27;s decision to place Patton in Europe, not his.

During the Battle of the Bulge, Patton devises a plan to relieve the trapped 101st Airborne Division in Bastogne, which he does before smashing through the Siegfried Line and into Germany. After Germany capitulates, Patton&#x27;s outspokenness lands him in trouble when he compares American politics to Nazism. Though he is relieved of command, he is kept on to see the rebuilding of Germany. He later walks Willie, his bull terrier, narrowly escaping death from a runaway cart (foreshadowing his death in a road accident some months later). Patton&#x27;s voice is heard:

==Production==
Lee Marvin, Burt Lancaster, John Wayne, Robert Mitchum and Rod Steiger declined the role of Patton. Steiger later said it was his greatest mistake. Charlton Heston was considered for the role of Omar N. Bradley before Karl Malden was cast.

===Development===
Attempts to make a film about the life of Patton had been made since he died in 1945 but his widow, Beatrice, resisted. After her death in 1953, producer Frank McCarthy began the project and, the day after Beatrice was buried, the producers contacted the family for help in making the film, requesting access to Patton&#x27;s diaries, as well as input from family members but the family declined to help. McCarthy also sought co-operation from The Pentagon; they also initially refused, as Patton&#x27;s son, George Patton IV, was in the Army, and Patton&#x27;s second daughter, Ruth, was married to an officer. By 1959, McCarthy had convinced the Army to co-operate.

20th Century Fox bought &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story,&quot; the 1951 autobiography of General of the Army Omar Bradley (who features prominently in the film, played by Karl Malden). Francis Ford Coppola wrote the film script in 1963 based largely on Ladislas Farago&#x27;s 1963 biography &quot;Patton: Ordeal and Triumph,&quot; and on &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot;. Edmund H. North was later brought in to help work on the script. The film was originally to be called &quot;Blood &amp; Guts&quot; and William Wyler was originally scheduled to direct. Wyler quit before the planned starting date of January 1969.

Bradley, the only surviving five-star general officer in the United States after the death of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1969, served as a consultant for the film though the extent of his influence and input into the final script is largely unknown. While Bradley knew Patton, it was also well known that the two men were opposites in personality, and there is evidence to conclude that Bradley despised Patton. As the film was made without Patton&#x27;s diaries, it largely relied upon observations by Bradley and other military contemporaries when they attempted to reconstruct Patton&#x27;s thoughts and motives. In a review of the film, Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall, who knew both Patton and Bradley, stated, &quot;The Bradley name gets heavy billing on a picture of [a] comrade that, while not caricature, is the likeness of a victorious, glory-seeking buffoon... Patton in the flesh was an enigma. He so stays in the film... Napoleon once said that the art of the general is not strategy but knowing how to mold human nature... Maybe that is all producer Frank McCarthy and Gen. Bradley, his chief advisor, are trying to say.&quot;

===Filming===

The film started shooting February 3, 1969 and was shot at seventy-one locations in six countries, mostly in Spain, which had a lot of the U.S. Army&#x27;s World War II surplus equipment.
Francoist Spain had sustained a currency control for decades and filming in the country was the only way to indirectly recover the profits of the box office from American films.
Cheap labor also encouraged runaway productions.

One scene, which depicts Patton driving up to an ancient city that is implied to be Carthage, was shot in the ancient Roman Mauretanian city of Volubilis, Morocco. The early scene, where Patton and Muhammed V are reviewing Moroccan troops including the Goumiers, was shot at the Royal Palace in Rabat. One unannounced battle scene was shot the night before, which raised fears in the Royal Palace neighborhood of a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. One paratrooper was electrocuted in power lines, but none of this battle footage appears in the film. The scene at the dedication of the welcome centre in Knutsford, Cheshire, England, was filmed at the actual site. The scenes set in Tunisia and Sicily were shot in Almeria in the south of Spain; Pamplona in the north was used for France and Germany; while the winter scenes in Belgium, including for the Battle of the Bulge sequence, were shot near Segovia (to which the production crew rushed when they were informed that snow had fallen). Interior shots were filmed in Seville.

The film was shot by cinematographer Fred J. Koenekamp in 65 mm Dimension 150, only the second film to be shot in that format after &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning...&quot; (1966).

A sizeable amount of battle scene footage was left out of the final cut of &quot;Patton&quot;, but a use was soon found for it. Outtakes from &quot;Patton&quot; were used to provide battle scenes in the made-for-TV film &quot;Fireball Forward&quot;, which was first broadcast in 1972. The film was produced by &quot;Patton&quot; producer Frank McCarthy and Edmund North wrote the screenplay. One of the cast members of &quot;Patton&quot;, Morgan Paull, appeared in this production.

===Opening===

The film opens with Scott&#x27;s rendering of Patton&#x27;s speech to the Third Army, set against a huge American flag. Coppola and North had to tone down Patton&#x27;s actual words and statements in the scene, as well as throughout the rest of the film, to avoid an R rating; in the opening monologue, the word &quot;fornicating&quot; replaced &quot;fucking&quot; when he was criticizing &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Also, Scott&#x27;s gravelly and scratchy voice is the opposite of Patton&#x27;s high-pitched, nasal and somewhat squeaky voice, a point noted by historian S.L.A. Marshall. However, Marshall also points out that the film contains &quot;too much cursing and obscenity [by Patton]. Patton was not habitually foul-mouthed. He used dirty words when he thought they were needed to impress.&quot;

When Scott learned that the speech would open the film, he refused to do it, as he believed that it would overshadow the rest of his performance. Director Schaffner assured him that it would be shown at the end. The scene was shot in one afternoon at Sevilla Studios in Madrid, with the flag having been painted on the back of the stage wall.

All the medals and decorations shown on Patton&#x27;s uniform in the monologue are replicas of those actually awarded to Patton. However, the general never wore all of them in public and was in any case not a four-star general at the time he made the famous speeches on which the opening is based. He wore them all on only one occasion, in his backyard in Virginia at the request of his wife, who wanted a picture of him with all his medals. The producers used a copy of this photo to help recreate this &quot;look&quot; for the opening scene.

===Music===
The critically acclaimed score for &quot;Patton&quot; was composed and conducted by the prolific composer Jerry Goldsmith. Goldsmith used a number of innovative methods to tie the music to the film, such as having an echoplex loop recorded sounds of &quot;call to war&quot; triplets played on the trumpet to musically represent General Patton&#x27;s belief in reincarnation. The main theme also consisted of a symphonic march accompanied by a pipe organ to represent the militaristic yet deeply religious nature of the protagonist. The music to &quot;Patton&quot; subsequently earned Goldsmith an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score and was one of the American Film Institute&#x27;s 250 nominees for the top twenty-five American film scores. The original soundtrack has been released three times on disc and once on LP: through Twentieth-Century Fox Records in 1970, Tsunami Records in 1992, Film Score Monthly in 1999, and a two-disc extended version through Intrada Records in 2010.

=====Disc Two=====
==Release==
The film had its premiere on Wednesday, February 4, 1970, at the Criterion Theatre in New York before its roadshow release starting the following day.

===First telecast===
&quot;Patton&quot; was first telecast by ABC as a three hours-plus color film special on Sunday, November 19, 1972, only two years after its theatrical release. That was highly unusual at the time, especially for a roadshow release which had played in theatres for many months. Most theatrical films at that time had to wait at least five years for their first telecast. Another unusual element of the telecast was that almost none of Patton&#x27;s profanity-laced dialogue was cut (only two sentences, one of which contained no profanity, were cut from the famous opening speech in front of the giant US flag). The film was the fourth highest-rated film broadcast on television in the United States at the time, with a Nielsen rating of 38.5 and an audience share of 65%.

===Home media===
In 1977, &quot;Patton&quot; was among the first 50 VHS and Betamax releases from Magnetic Video. The film would be released on Laserdisc in 1981, also by Magnetic Video. A widescreen version was released in 1989, which includes four newsreels about the real Patton. A THX-certified Laserdisc would be released on July 9, 1997, trading the newsreels for many new features. A THX-certified widescreen VHS was also released in 1998 by the same distributor, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

&quot;Patton&quot; was first released on DVD in 1999, featuring an audio commentary by Charles M. Province, the founder of The George S. Patton Jr. Historical Society, and again in 2006, with a commentary by screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola and extra bonus features.

The film made its Region A (locked) Blu-ray debut in 2008 to much criticism, for its excessive use of digital noise reduction on the picture quality. In 2012, a remaster was released with much improved picture quality. In June 2013, Fox UK released the film on Region B Blu-ray but reverted to the 2008 transfer.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed an estimated $51,000 in its first week. According to Fox records the film required $22,525,000 in theatrical rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $27,650,000 so made a profit to the studio. Eventually, it returned worldwide rentals of $45 million, including $28.1 million from the United States and Canada from a gross of $61.8 million.

===Critical response===
Roger Ebert said of George C. Scott, &quot;It is one of those sublime performances in which the personalities of the actor and the character are fulfilled in one another.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that George C. Scott &quot;has created an acting tour de force,&quot; but found it &quot;repetitive – the second half doesn&#x27;t tell us anything more than the first.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The most refreshing thing about &#x27;Patton&#x27; is that here—I think for the first time—the subject matter and the style of the epic war movie are perfectly matched ... Although the cast is large, the only performance of note is that of Scott, who is continuously entertaining and, occasionally, very appealing.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&#x27;Patton&#x27; has, like &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, done the near-impossible by creating a finely detailed portrait despite all the tuggings toward simplification which are inevitable in the big budget, long, loud roadshow production desperate to attract mass audiences. As Patton, George Scott gives one of the great and unforgettable screen characterizations.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;eventually shares the dramatic limitations, as well as the visual triumphs, of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;: yet another fascinating but inconclusive portrait of a mercurial military leader. The camera focus is sharp, but the dramatic focus is blurred. We never quite understand Patton in historical context, in relation to the other generals of the period, and to the entire Allied war effort.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that &quot;technically the movie is awesomely impressive,&quot; but went on to state that &quot;I&#x27;m sure it will be said that the picture is &#x27;true&#x27; to Patton and to history, but I think it strings us along and holds out on us. If we don&#x27;t just want to have our prejudices greased, we&#x27;ll find it confusing and unsatisfying, because we aren&#x27;t given enough information to evaluate Patton&#x27;s actions.&quot; John Gillett of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;While communicating a relish for the man with all his warts, [Schaffner] also pinpoints the monstrous prejudices which lay beneath the surface. And, of course, he chose the right actor. Karl Malden&#x27;s Bradley is neatly observed and the German players are good, but Scott&#x27;s performance rightly dwarfs all the rest.&quot;

Online film critic James Berardinelli has called &quot;Patton&quot; his favorite film of all time and &quot;to this day one of Hollywood&#x27;s most compelling biographical war pictures.&quot;

According to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein&#x27;s book &quot;The Final Days&quot;, it was also Richard Nixon&#x27;s favorite film. Nixon first viewed &quot;Patton&quot; with his family at a private screening in the White House Family Theater on April 5, 1970. Nixon became obsessed with the film, repeatedly watching it with Henry Kissinger over the next month. He screened it several times at the White House and during a cruise on the presidential yacht USS &quot;Sequoia&quot; in the Potomac River. Kissinger sarcastically wrote of Nixon&#x27;s insistence that he see the film on the cruise: &quot;It was the second time he had so honored me. Inspiring as the film no doubt was, I managed to escape for an hour in the middle of it to prepare for the next day’s NSC meeting.&quot;

Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 90% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 52 reviews, with an average score of 8.4/10. Rotten Tomatoes summarizes the critical consensus as, &quot;George C. Scott&#x27;s sympathetic, unflinching portrayal of the titular general in this sprawling epic is as definitive as any performance in the history of American biopics.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 1971, the film was nominated for 10 Academy Awards at the 1971 ceremony, winning seven awards (including Best Picture). George C. Scott also won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, but he declined it, citing a dislike of the voting process and the concept of acting competitions. He was the first actor to do so. The film&#x27;s producer, Frank McCarthy, accepted the award on Scott&#x27;s behalf.

The Best Picture statuette is on display at the George C. Marshall Museum at the Virginia Military Institute, courtesy of Frank McCarthy.

* In 2006, the Writers Guild of America selected Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North&#x27;s adapted screenplay as the 94th best screenplay of all time.

==Sequel==
A made-for-television sequel, &quot;The Last Days of Patton,&quot; was produced in 1986. Scott reprised his title role. The film was based on Patton&#x27;s final weeks after being mortally injured in a car accident, with flashbacks of Patton&#x27;s life.

<text>Airport is a 1970 American air disaster–drama film written and directed by George Seaton and starring Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin. Based on Arthur Hailey&#x27;s 1968 novel, it originated the 1970s disaster film genre. It is also the first of four films in the &quot;Airport&quot; film series. Produced on a $10 million budget, it earned over $128 million. The supporting cast features Jean Seberg, Jacqueline Bisset, George Kennedy, Helen Hayes, Van Heflin, Maureen Stapleton, Barry Nelson, Lloyd Nolan, Dana Wynter and Barbara Hale.

The film is about an airport manager trying to keep his airport open during a snowstorm, while a suicide bomber plots to blow up a Boeing 707 airliner in flight. It takes place at fictional Lincoln International Airport near Chicago. The film was a commercial success and surpassed &quot;Spartacus&quot; as Universal Pictures&#x27; biggest moneymaker. The movie won Helen Hayes an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as an elderly stowaway and was nominated for nine other Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Cinematography for Ernest Laszlo, and Best Costume Design for designer Edith Head.

With attention paid to the detail of day-to-day airport and airline operations, the plot concerns the response to a paralyzing snowstorm, environmental concerns over noise pollution, and an attempt to blow up an airliner. The film is characterized by personal stories intertwining while decisions are made minute-by-minute by the airport and airline staffs, operations and maintenance crews, flight crews, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers.

Ernest Laszlo photographed it in 70 mm Todd-AO. It is the last film scored by Alfred Newman and the last film roles of Van Heflin and Jessie Royce Landis. It was also Ross Hunter&#x27;s last film produced for Universal after a 17-year tenure.

==Plot==
During a severe January snowstorm at Chicago&#x27;s fictional Lincoln International Airport, Trans Global Airlines (TGA) Flight 45&#x27;s crew misjudge their turn from Runway 29 onto the taxiway. The Boeing 707 aircraft gets stuck in the snow, and its tail sticking out results in that runway&#x27;s closure. Airport manager Mel Bakersfeld is forced to work overtime, causing tension with his wife. A divorce seems imminent as he nurtures a closer relationship with a co-worker, customer relations agent Tanya Livingston.

Pilot Vernon Demerest is scheduled to evaluate Captain Anson Harris during TGA Flight 2 to Rome, aboard the airline&#x27;s flagship international service - &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot;. Despite being married to Bakersfeld&#x27;s sister, Demerest is having an affair with Gwen Meighen, chief stewardess on the flight, who informs him before takeoff that she is pregnant with his child. They consider abortion, but Gwen has moral qualms about such a procedure and expresses the excitement she felt upon being told of her pregnancy.

Bakersfeld calls in senior mechanic Joe Patroni to assist with removing the snowstuck plane. He and Tanya also deal with Ada Quonsett, an elderly widow from San Diego who is a habitual stowaway on various airlines. Bakersfeld also clashes with commissioner Ackerman, who wishes to close the alternate runway 22 (and thus the entire airport) due of noise complaints from nearby residents.

Former U.S. Army Corps of Engineers demolition expert Dominic (D.O.) Guerrero, who has a history of mental illness, buys both a ticket aboard Flight 2 and a large life insurance policy, intending to commit suicide. He plans to set off a bomb in an attaché case while they fly over the Atlantic Ocean so that his wife, Inez, will collect $225,000 of insurance. His erratic behavior at the airport, including mistaking a Customs officer for a gate agent, attracts officials&#x27; attention. Inez finds a Special Delivery envelope from a travel agency and, realizing D.O. might be doing something desperate, goes to the airport to try to dissuade him. She informs officials that he had been fired from a construction job for &quot;misplacing&quot; explosives and that the family&#x27;s financial situation is dire.

Ada Quonsett manages to evade the employee assigned the task of putting her on a flight back to Los Angeles. Enchanted by the idea of a trip to Rome, she talks her way past the gate agent, boards Flight 2 and sits next to Guerrero. When Flight 2&#x27;s crew is made aware of Guerrero&#x27;s situation, they turn the plane back toward Chicago without informing the passengers. Once the stowaway widow is discovered, her help is enlisted by the crew --- with the promise to her of a free lifetime travel-voucher --- to get to the briefcase, but the ploy fails.

Demerest tries to persuade Guerrero not to trigger the bomb, informing him that his insurance policy has been nullified. Guerrero moves to give Demerest the bomb, but then runs into the lavatory and sets it off, dying and blowing a three-foot hole in the rear fuselage. Gwen and some other passengers are seriously injured in the explosion and subsequent explosive decompression, but the pilots retain control of the 707. However, flight control is severely hindered due to the blast damage.

With all eastern airports closed due to bad weather, Flight 2 returns to Lincoln for an emergency landing. Demerest knows that a fatal crash landing would happen if they attempt to land on the shorter Runway 22, and thus demands the airport&#x27;s longest runway, Runway 29, which is still closed due to the stuck airliner. Bakersfeld orders that plane be sacrificed and forcibly pushed off by snowplows. However, Patroni goes ahead and manages to free the stuck aircraft without damage by defying the specified engine and structural limit requirements, allowing Runway 29 to be reopened just in time for the crippled Flight 2 to land. His assistant declares that the feat was &quot;impossible&quot; according to the manual, to which Patroni replies &quot;That&#x27;s one nice thing about the 707. It can do everything but read.&quot;

As the passengers exit, a tearful Inez apologizes for her husband&#x27;s actions. Demerest&#x27;s wife sees him accompanying Gwen&#x27;s stretcher as he intends to go with Gwen to the hospital. Demerest has by now decided he wants her to go through with her pregnancy. Ada Quonsett enjoys her reward of free first-class travel on TGA. Bakersfeld and Tanya leave together, heading to her apartment for &quot;rest&quot; and breakfast.

==Cast==

==Production==
Most of the filming was at Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. A display in the terminal, with stills from the field and the film, says: &quot;Minnesota&#x27;s legendary winters attracted Hollywood here in 1969, when portions of the film &quot;Airport&quot; were shot in the terminal and on the field. The weather remained stubbornly clear, however, forcing the director to use plastic &#x27;snow&#x27; to create the appropriate effect.&quot;

Seaton caught pneumonia Christmas Day in 1968 and Henry Hathaway took over directing while Seaton recovered, directing all of the exteriors; despite shooting for five weeks, Hathaway elected for no payment.

The expensive set built representing the full interior of the 707 was left standing at Universal Studios, and was eventually joined with a more expensive airliner set, the front half of a 747-interior constructed in 1974 for &quot;Airport 1975&quot;. These two sets became known as &quot;Stage 747&quot; on the lot, and both sets were used extensively in other Universal films and television series. The 707 set was used, for instance, in &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; and on series like &quot;Ironside&quot;. The sets were amortized over these many productions, and later removed around 2002 and the space converted into a workshop.

Only one Boeing 707 was used: a model 707-349C (registration ) leased from Flying Tiger Line. It sported an El Al cheatline over its bare metal finish, with the fictional Trans Global Airlines (TGA) titles and tail. This aircraft later crashed on March 21, 1989 during approach into São Paulo while in service as cargo flight Transbrasil Flight 801, killing all three crew members and 22 people on the ground.

==Release==
&quot;Airport&quot; was released on March 5, 1970 at New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film grossed $235,000 in its opening week at Radio City Music Hall, placing seventh at the US box office. It expanded to more cities in its third week of release and went to number one at the US box office where it stayed for a second week. It returned to number one in its eighth week of release where it again spent two weeks at the top; a feat repeated three weeks later After 12 weeks of release, it had grossed $9.5 million, including $2.6 million at Radio City Music Hall. It returned again to the top spot in its 17th and 19th week of release for a total of eight weeks at number one.

By the end of the year, it was the highest-grossing film of the year with theatrical rentals of $37.7 million in the United States and Canada and the seventh highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada of all-time. Universal claimed that it was the highest-grossing film without a roadshow release of all-time.

It went on to gross $100,489,151 in the United States and Canada, which, adjusted for inflation, is equivalent to $ million in . Internationally, it grossed $27.9 million for a worldwide gross of $128.4 million.

===Critical response===
&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Based on the novel by Arthur Hailey, over-produced by Ross Hunter with a cast of stars as long as a jet runway, and adapted and directed by George Seaton in a glossy, slick style, &quot;Airport&quot; is a handsome, often dramatically involving $10 million epitaph to a bygone brand of filmmaking&quot; but added that the film &quot;does not create suspense because the audience knows how it&#x27;s going to end.&quot;Boxoffice praised the film&#x27;s strong production values, excellent cast, and potential to be very popular but foresaw that other critics&#x27; opinions would not be universally favourable. Film critic Pauline Kael gave &quot;Airport&quot; one of its worst contemporary reviews, scornfully dismissing it as &quot;bland entertainment of the old school.&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s no electricity in it&quot;, she wrote; &quot;every stereotyped action is followed by a stereotyped reaction.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and faulted a predictable plot and characters that &quot;talk in regulation B-movie clichés like no B-movie you&#x27;ve seen in ten years.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and reported that while the theater audience cheered at the climax, &quot;it&#x27;s a long and torturous road to the applause. Blocking the path are speeches that promote the industry, dialog that ranks among the silliest in memory, and a labored plot that tells you everything twice. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an immensely silly film—and it will probably entertain people who no longer care very much about movies.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;breath-taking in its celebration of anything which used to work when Hollywood was younger and we were all more innocent.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a lousy movie&quot; that was &quot;utterly predictable.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Corny is really the only word for this unbelievably old-fashioned look at the modern phenomenon of an international airport: the one surprise is that the sweet old white-haired stowaway doesn&#x27;t spring to the controls and bring the distressed aircraft down single-handed as Doris Day did once upon a time in analogous circumstances.&quot;

Christopher Null wrote in 2000, &quot;With one grandiose entrance, &quot;Airport&quot; ushered in a genre of moviemaking that is still going strong—the disaster movie... Too bad the &#x27;disaster&#x27; doesn&#x27;t happen until 2 hours into the 2:15 movie. No matter—&quot;Airport&quot;″s unending sequels and spoofs are a testament that this film is a true piece of Americana, for good or for bad.&quot; Despite the film being one of the most profitable of Burt Lancaster&#x27;s career, he called it &quot;a piece of junk.&quot;

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 75%, based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. On Metacritic, the film holds an average rating of 42/100, based on 5 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
===Television===
The film was first broadcast on Canada&#x27;s CTV on October 24, 1973, nearly a month before ABC on November 11. The ABC broadcast became the joint highest-rated film on television, matching &quot;Love Story&quot;, with a Nielsen rating of 42.3 but with a slightly higher audience share of 63% (compared to &quot;Love Story&quot;&#x27;s 62%). The record was beaten in 1976 by &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

==Score==
The film was the final project for composer Alfred Newman. His health was failing and he was unable to conduct the sessions for his music&#x27;s recording. The job was handled by Stanley Wilson, although the covers of the Decca &quot;original soundtrack album&quot; and the 1993 Varèse Sarabande CD issue credit Newman. Newman did conduct the music heard in the film. He died before the film&#x27;s release. Newman received his 45th Academy Award nomination posthumously for this film, the most received by a composer at that time.

==Soundtrack==
* From the soundtrack, the instrumental, &quot;Airport Love Theme&quot; by Vincent Bell peaked at number thirty-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and number two for three weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult contemporary chart.

<doc id="99461" wikidata="Q729991" url="?curid=99461" title="Love Story (1970 film)">
<text>Love Story is a 1970 American romantic drama film written by Erich Segal, who was also the author of the best-selling 1970 eponymous novel. It was produced by Howard G. Minsky, and directed by Arthur Hiller, starring Ali MacGraw, Ryan O&#x27;Neal, John Marley, Ray Milland and Tommy Lee Jones in his film debut.

The film is considered one of the most romantic by the American Film Institute (No. 9 on the list) and is one of the highest-grossing films of all time adjusted for inflation. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; (1978), starring O&#x27;Neal with Candice Bergen.

==Plot==
Oliver Barrett IV, heir of an old money East Coast White Anglo-Saxon Protestant family, attends Harvard College, where he majors in social studies and plays ice hockey. He meets Jennifer &quot;Jenny&quot; Cavilleri, a quick-witted, working-class Radcliffe College student reading classical music. He invites her to a hockey game vs Dartmouth College and they fall in love despite their differences.

Later, Oliver&#x27;s father drives a long distance to Ithaca, New York, to see his son&#x27;s hockey game against Cornell University for the All-Ivy title. Barrett is suspended from the game for fighting and Harvard loses to Cornell, 4–3. Oliver turns down his father&#x27;s offer of a steak dinner and help in getting into Harvard Law School.

Jenny reveals that she has a scholarship in Paris arranged for after her Radcliffe graduation. Oliver is upset that he does not figure in Jenny&#x27;s plans and proposes marriage. She accepts his proposal and he takes her to the Barrett mansion to meet his parents, who are uncomfortable with her Italian-American and blue-collar background. Oliver&#x27;s father says he will cut him off financially if he marries Jenny.

They visit her father, Phil, a widowed baker in Cranston, Rhode Island, who wants Oliver to get along with his father. Phil wants a Catholic wedding but Oliver and Jenny marry themselves with him reciting &quot;Song of the Open Road&quot; by Walt Whitman and her reciting &quot;Sonnett 22&quot; by Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

Jenny works as a teacher but without his father&#x27;s financial support the couple struggles to pay Oliver&#x27;s way through Harvard Law School. Oliver graduates third in his class and takes a position at a high-powered New York City law firm. They are ready to start a family but fail to conceive. After Jenny undergoes three blood tests, Oliver is told that she is terminally ill.

Oliver attempts to continue as normal without telling Jenny of her condition, but she confronts her doctor and finds out the truth. Oliver buys tickets to Paris, but she declines to go, wanting only to spend time with him. Oliver seeks money from his estranged father to pay for Jenny&#x27;s medical care, but as a matter of pride does not disclose the reason for this request. Although his father assumes an extramarital affair, which Oliver makes no attempt to deny, he lends the money anyway.

From her hospital bed, Jenny makes arrangements with her father for a Catholic funeral. She tells Oliver to not blame himself, insisting that he never held her back from music and Paris and it was worth it for the love they shared. Jenny&#x27;s last wish is for Oliver to embrace her tightly as she dies.

A grief-stricken Oliver leaves the hospital and he sees his father outside, having learned the true reason for Oliver&#x27;s request. When his father gives his condolence, Oliver replies that &quot;love means never having to say you&#x27;re sorry&quot;, something that Jenny had said to him earlier. Oliver walks alone to the open air ice rink, where Jenny had watched him skate the day she was hospitalized.

==Development==
Erich Segal was an academic who had branched into screenwriting with films such as &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and &quot;The Games&quot;. He wanted to do a &quot;story out of a 1940s movie&quot; updated to the present day, &quot;based on what I have observed among my students, living as I do right on campus. It deals with today’s personal commitment of one to one and the quest for a permanent relationship which begins much younger than it used to. The old, mindless football game dating is gone. The question of sexual morality is irrelevant, but there is much less ‘swinging’ among young people now than in the old days.”

The movie was originally written as a screenplay but Erich Segal was unable to sell it. Howard Minsky, who was head of the motion picture division on the east coast for the William Morris Agency, who represented Segal, believed in the project. According to Arthur Hiller, &quot;He gave up his job and made an arrangement with Erich Segal because he had such faith in that project. He mothered it all the way through. If it hadn&#x27;t been for him, it would never have been a film.&quot;

Minksy says he had Segal rewrite the script seven times. The changes included altering the female lead from being Jewish to Italian-American, deleting the character of the girl&#x27;s mother, and minimizing swearing and nudity.

The script was read by Ali MacGraw, who wanted to make it. She had just made &quot;Goodbye Columbus&quot; for Paramount Pictures, then under Robert Evans. Paramount had signed MacGraw to a three picture deal and agreed to make the film as a vehicle for MacGraw. In May 1969, Evans announced that he wanted a &quot;sensitive young actor&quot; like Beau Bridges or Jon Voight for the lead and Larry Peerce, who had made &quot;Goodbye Columbus&quot;, would direct. Evans later said Peerce took the job because he &quot;desperately needed a gig&quot; but the director was always unhappy working on the project and pulled out after a month. He was replaced by Anthony Harvey, who had made &quot;Lion in Winter&quot;, but Harvey quit the project after collaborating with Segal. Eventually Arthur Hiller, who was making two films at Paramount (&quot;The Out of Towners&quot; and &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;) agreed to direct.

In September 1969 it was announced Hiller would direct and that Harper and Row would publish a novelized version of the script in February of the following year. According to Evans, Paramount had suggested Segal adapt the screenplay into a novel to help promote the film. Minsky says he was the one who suggested this. Peter Bart, then an executive at Paramount, claims he suggested it. Segal says that he wrote the novel at the same time as the screenplay with considerable input from Gene Young of &quot;Harpers&quot; who was editor. The book was published in time for Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1970, and became a best seller. 

==Casting==
According to press reports, the lead role of Oliver Barrett IV was refused by Jeff Bridges, Michael Douglas, Beau Bridges, Michael York and Jon Voight. Evans says that Michael Sarrazin, Peter Fonda and Keith Carradine also turned it down. MacGraw recalls auditioning opposite Christopher Walken, Ken Howard and David Birney.

Hiller says &quot;we tested eight or nine different actors and Ryan was the best. He didn&#x27;t bowl us over at first. Then I saw some footage of a film he was just completing at 20th Century Fox and I thought it would be wonderful. He just had that empathy and feeling that was so necessary.&quot; According to a contemporary account, O&#x27;Neal was tested on the recommendation of Erich Segal, who had worked with him on &quot;The Games&quot;; he was paid $25,000. Evans later claimed he insisted O&#x27;Neal be cast because he made the best test, over the objections of Hiller who wanted Walken.

In November 1969 Evans claimed &quot;We looked at 1,000 actors and that&#x27;s not an exaggeration. We tested 14 unknowns and none of them compared to O&#x27;Neal.&quot;

Bill Cleary, former Harvard and 1960 U.S. Olympic hockey star (and later Harvard&#x27;s hockey coach/athletic director), was Ryan O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s hockey stand-in during key hockey scenes where skating and hockey-playing ability were required. Hockey scenes were filmed in three days at Harvard&#x27;s former Watson Rink, which was rebuilt and is now known as Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Other hockey players in the film were played mostly by actual Harvard and Boston University hockey players, including Joe Cavanagh and Mike Hyndman.

O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s younger brother, Kevin O&#x27;Neal (1945–2023), had a bit part in the film.

==Production==
Filming started November 18, 1969, on location in Cambridge and Boston, and New York. It was the first time a film had gotten permission to film at Harvard. Moreover, the Ice Skating Rink for the Harvard vs Cornell game was shot at Hamilton College.

Filming &quot;Love Story&quot; on location resulted in damage to trees on campus. This experience, followed by a similar experience with the film &quot;A Small Circle of Friends&quot; (1980), caused the university administration to deny most subsequent requests for filming on location.

The scenes where they lived as newlyweds in Cambridge were filmed in the Agassiz neighborhood. Oliver carries Jenny over the threshold at 119 Oxford Street.

Jimmy Webb wrote a score for the film that was not used. Burt Bacharach was approached to do the score but pulled out when Robert Evans requested a score similar to that of Frances Lai. Eventually Lai was cast.

The main song in the film, &quot;(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story&quot; was a major success, particularly the vocal rendition recorded by Andy Williams.

Arthur Hiller recalled, &quot;We thought we were making a nice little movie. Well, all of us thought that except the producer who kept saying, &quot;Arthur, believe me, this will be big.&quot; And I said, &quot;Yes Howard, you&#x27;re the producer, you have to feel that way.&quot; But he was totally right.&quot;

Filming finished on February 3, 1970.

==Release==
The premiere for &quot;Love Story&quot; took place at Loew&#x27;s State I theater in New York City on Wednesday, December 16, 1970.

===Critical reception===
Overall, &quot;Love Story&quot; received positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected reviews from 30 critics and gave the film a score of 63%. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Earnest and determined to make audiences swoon, &quot;Love Story&quot; is an unabashed tearjerker that will capture hearts when it isn&#x27;t inducing eye rolls.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and called it &quot;infinitely better than the book,&quot; adding, &quot;because Hiller makes the lovers into individuals, of course we&#x27;re moved by the film&#x27;s conclusion. Why not?&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was also positive, writing that although &quot;the plotline has been honored many times... It&#x27;s the telling that matters: the surfaces and the textures and the charm of the actors. And it is hard to see how these quantities could have been significantly improved upon in &quot;Love Story&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Newsweek&quot; felt the film was contrived and film critic Judith Crist called &quot;Love Story&quot; &quot;&quot;Camille&quot; with bullshit&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;I can&#x27;t remember any movie of such comparable high-style kitsch since Leo McCarey&#x27;s &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1939) and his 1957 remake, &quot;An Affair to Remember.&quot; The only really depressing thing about &quot;Love Story&quot; is the thought of all the terrible imitations that will inevitably follow it.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that &quot;whereas the novel has a built-in excuse for being spare (it is told strictly as the boy&#x27;s reminiscence), the film does not. Seeing the characters in the movie ... makes us want to know something about them. We get precious little, and love by fiat doesn&#x27;t work well in film.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;I found this one of the most thoroughly resistible sentimental films I&#x27;ve ever seen. There is scarcely a character or situation or line in the story that rings true, that suggests real simplicity or generosity of feeling, a sentiment or emotion honestly experienced and expressed.&quot; Writer Harlan Ellison wrote in &quot;The Other Glass Teat&quot;, his book of collected criticism, that it was &quot;shit&quot;. John Simon wrote that &quot;Love Story&quot; was so bad that it never once moved him.

&quot;Love Story&quot; was ranked number 9 on the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions list, which recognizes the top 100 love stories in American cinema. The film also spawned a trove of imitations, parodies, and homages in countless films, having re-energized melodrama on the silver screen, as well as helping to set the template for the modern &quot;chick flick&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Love Story&quot; was an instant box-office smash. It opened in two theaters in New York City, Loew&#x27;s State I and Tower East, grossing $128,022 in its first week. It expanded into another 166 theaters on Christmas Day and grossed a record $2,463,916 for the weekend, becoming the number-one film in the United States. It also grossed a record $5,007,706 for the week and grossed $2,493,167 the following weekend. It remained number one at the US box office for the next four weeks, before finishing second behind &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; for one week and then returning to the top of the box office for another six weeks.

It went into general release in the United States on June 23, 1971, expanding into an additional 143 theaters in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit and St. Louis, grossing $1,660,761 in five days and returned to number one at the US box office for another 3 weeks, for a total of 15 weeks at number one. It was the sixth highest-grossing film of all time in U.S. and Canada with a gross of $106,397,186.

Adjusted for inflation, the film remains one of the top 50 domestic grosses of all time. It grossed an additional $67 million in international film markets for a worldwide total of $173.4 million ($1.3 billion in 2023 dollars).

Arthur Hiller later reflected, &quot;We had been going through a period of individuality in the 1960s, what I call the ‘biker films, like &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969). If &quot;Love Story&quot; [had come] out a few years earlier, it would have been run over by the motorcycles. A few years after, it would be lost to special effects. Movies have their time of why they work and why they don’t.&quot;

Hiller also said, &quot;The message of &quot;Love Story&quot; really is what two people can give to each other for love alone. You know, people made fun of the phrase &quot;Love means never having to say you&#x27;re sorry.&quot; But think about it. All it says is that if you love somebody, you understand they&#x27;re not perfect and they don&#x27;t have to apologize for every little thing they do that isn&#x27;t perfect. Its an affirmation of the human spirit... We hit at a time when if you disagreed with somebody, you hated them. That was the feeling in 1969 and 1970. Well, people were tired of that and were looking to say, hey, love is okay. You can be mad at somebody and still love them.&quot;

Peter Bart, an executive at Paramount when the film was made, said &quot;&quot;Love Story&quot; had become a sort of cinematic aphrodisiac. A kid would take his date to the film, they would cry together, commiserate about the tragedy, then they would go to bed, as though to celebrate their survival. Hence each night the lines seemed to grow longer as the boys kept pressing their luck.&quot;

===Accolades===
====American Film Institute====
===Television===
The film was first broadcast on ABC television on October 1, 1972, and became the most-watched film on television surpassing &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959) with 27 million homes watching, with a score of 42.3 by Nielsen ratings and an audience share of 62%. The rating was equaled the following year by &quot;Airport&quot; (1970) and then surpassed in 1976 by &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939).

===Harvard College screenings=== 
The Crimson Key Society, a student association, has sponsored screenings of &quot;Love Story&quot; during orientation to each incoming class of Harvard College freshmen since the late 1970s. During the showings, society members and other audience members mock, boo, and jeer &quot;maudlin, old-fashioned and just plain schlocky&quot; moments to humorously build school spirit.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack from the film was released separately as an album, and distributed by Quality Records.

==Sequels and remake==
O&#x27;Neal and Milland reprised their roles for a sequel, &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot;, released in 1978. It was based on Segal&#x27;s 1977 novel. The film begins with Jenny&#x27;s funeral, then picks up 18 months later. Oliver is a successful, but unhappy, lawyer in New York. Although still mourning Jenny, he manages to find love with heiress Marcie Bonwit (Candice Bergen). Suffering from comparisons to the original, &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; did poorly with both critics and audiences.

NBC broadcast &quot;Love Story&quot;, a short-lived romantic anthology television series, in 1973–1974. Although it shared its name with the novel and movie and used the same theme song – &quot;(Where Do I Begin) Love Story&quot; – as the film, it otherwise was unrelated to them, with no characters or storylines in common with either the novel or the film.

In February 2021, remodeled ViacomCBS streaming service Paramount+ announced a remake of &quot;Love Story&quot; as a TV series, to be part of their new lineup of content. The series is to be produced by young adult stalwarts Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, made prominent due to young adult hits such as &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; and &quot;Looking for Alaska&quot;. It is to be made for Schwartz and Savage&#x27;s production house, Fake Empire, as a co-production between Paramount Television Studios and CBS Studios.

==Criticism== 
Jenny Cavilleri&#x27;s disease being unspecified and her relatively good looks during the onset of her illness was met with criticism for its implausibility. Vincent Canby wrote in his original &quot;New York Times&quot; review that it was &quot;as if Jenny was suffering from some vaguely unpleasant Elizabeth Arden treatment&quot;. &quot;Mad&quot; magazine ran a parody of the film (&quot;Lover&#x27;s Story&quot;) in its October 1971 issue, which depicted Ali MacGraw&#x27;s character as stricken with &quot;Old Movie Disease&quot;, an ailment that causes a dying patient to become &quot;more beautiful by the minute&quot;. In 1997, Roger Ebert defined &quot;Ali MacGraw&#x27;s Disease&quot; as a movie illness in which &quot;the only symptom is that the patient grows more beautiful until finally dying&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In 1971, the 20th episode of the fourth season of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; featured a take-off of the film called &quot;Lovely Story&quot;, with Carol Burnett in the MacGraw role and Harvey Korman in the O&#x27;Neal role.

The film&#x27;s female protagonist has been credited with the spike in the baby name Jennifer in North America in 1970, launching it to the number 1 feminine given name. It would hold this position for 14 years.

At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Canadian Pairs figure skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier skated their free skate to the film&#x27;s theme, initially losing the gold medal in a now-infamous 2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal moment in sports history.

In 2020, the film&#x27;s theme music was played during the funeral procession of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.

In an interview at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival, Taylor Swift cited &quot;Love Story&quot; as an inspiration for the autumnal set design of &quot;All Too Well: The Short Film&quot;.

<doc id="99463" wikidata="Q220735" url="?curid=99463" title="The French Connection (film)">
<text>The French Connection is a 1971 American neo-noir action thriller film directed by William Friedkin and starring Gene Hackman, Roy Scheider, and Fernando Rey. The screenplay, by Ernest Tidyman, is based on Robin Moore&#x27;s 1969 nonfiction book about narcotics detectives Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso. It tells the story of their fictional counterparts, New York Police Department detectives Jimmy &quot;Popeye&quot; Doyle and Buddy &quot;Cloudy&quot; Russo, in pursuit of wealthy French heroin smuggler Alain Charnier (played by Rey).

At the 44th Academy Awards, the film earned eight nominations and won five, for Best Picture, Best Actor (Hackman), Best Director, Best Film Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor (Scheider), Best Cinematography and Best Sound Mixing. Tidyman also received a Golden Globe Award nomination, a Writers Guild of America Award, and an Edgar Award for his screenplay. A sequel, &quot;French Connection II&quot;, followed in 1975, with Hackman and Rey reprising their roles.

&quot;The French Connection&quot; appeared on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the best American films in 1998 and again in 2007, placing 70th the first time and 98th the second. In 2005, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In Marseille, a police detective follows Alain Charnier, who runs a heroin-smuggling syndicate. Charnier&#x27;s hitman, Pierre Nicoli, murders the detective. Charnier plans to smuggle $32 million worth of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, television personality Henri Devereaux, who is traveling to New York City by ship. In New York, detectives Jimmy &quot;Popeye&quot; Doyle and Buddy &quot;Cloudy&quot; Russo go out for drinks at the Copacabana. Popeye observes Salvatore &quot;Sal&quot; Boca and his young wife, Angie, entertaining mobsters involved in narcotics. They tail the couple and establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock, a buyer in the narcotics underworld. Popeye learns that a shipment of heroin will arrive soon. The detectives convince their supervisor to wiretap the Bocas&#x27; phones. Popeye and Cloudy are joined by federal agents Mulderig and Klein.

Devereaux&#x27;s vehicle arrives in New York City. Boca is in a hurry to make the purchase, but Weinstock urges patience, knowing they are being surveilled. Charnier realizes he is being surveilled as well, identifies Popeye as a detective, and escapes on a departing subway shuttle at Grand Central Station. To evade Popeye, he has Boca meet him in Washington D.C., where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier wants to conclude the deal quickly. On the flight back to New York City, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier says Popeye would just be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in France before a replacement is assigned. Soon, Nicoli attempts to snipe Popeye but misses. Popeye chases Nicoli, who boards an elevated subway train. Popeye shouts to a policeman on the train to catch Nicoli and then commandeers a passing car. He gives chase, crashing into several vehicles on the way.

Realizing he is being pursued, Nicoli shoots the policeman who tries to intervene, and hijacks the train at gunpoint, forcing the motorman to drive through the next station and shooting the conductor. The motorman suffers a heart attack, and the train is about to collide with another when the emergency brake engages, hurling Nicoli to the floor. Popeye arrives and sees Nicoli descending from the platform. Nicoli sees Popeye and turns to run, but Popeye shoots him dead. After a long stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux&#x27;s Lincoln. In a police garage, mechanics tear the car apart, searching for drugs, but come up empty-handed. Then Cloudy discovers that the car&#x27;s weight was 120 pounds over its standard weight, implying that the contraband must be in the car. Finally, they remove the rocker panels and find packages of heroin. Because the original car was destroyed during the search, the police substitute a lookalike and return it to Devereaux, who delivers it to Charnier.

Charnier drives to an old factory on Wards Island, where Boca&#x27;s brother Lou works, to meet Weinstock and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panel covers removed, Weinstock&#x27;s chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality. Charnier removes the drugs and hides the money inside the rocker panels of another car purchased at a junk car auction, which he plans to take back to France. Charnier and Sal drive off in the Lincoln, but a large contingent of police led by Popeye blocks their path. The police chase the Lincoln back to the factory, where Boca is killed during a shootout. Most of the other criminals surrender. Charnier escapes into a nearby abandoned bakery with Popeye and Cloudy in pursuit. Popeye sees a shadowy figure in the distance and opens fire too late to heed a warning, killing Mulderig. Undaunted, he tells Cloudy he will get Charnier. He reloads his gun and runs into another room. A single gunshot is heard.

Title cards describe various characters&#x27; fates: Weinstock was indicted, but his case was dismissed for &quot;lack of proper evidence&quot;; Angie Boca received a suspended sentence for an unspecified misdemeanor; Lou Boca received a reduced sentence; Devereaux served four years in a federal penitentiary for conspiracy; Charnier was never caught. Popeye and Cloudy were transferred out of the narcotics division and reassigned.
==Cast==
==Production==
National General Pictures was originally set to produce the film but dropped it, and Richard Zanuck and David Brown offered to make it at Fox with a $1.5 million budget. The film came in $300,000 over budget, at $1.8 million.

The overall atmosphere, character characterization, and narrative style are largely influenced by the French film &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; (1967) by Jean-Pierre Melville. William Friedkin was also inspired by Alain Delon&#x27;s performance, where he plays a solitary and methodical hitman, to shape the character of Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman). The chase scene in the subway of &quot;The French Connection&quot; is also taken from &quot;Le Samouraï&quot;.&quot;

In an audio commentary Friedkin recorded for the film&#x27;s Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD release, he says the film&#x27;s documentary-like realism was the direct result of his having seen Costa-Gavras&#x27;s &quot;Z&quot;. He describes &quot;Z&quot;&#x27;s influence on &quot;The French Connection&quot;:

The film was among the earliest to show the World Trade Center: the completed North Tower and partially completed South Tower are seen in the background of scenes at the shipyard after Devereaux arrives in New York.

===Casting===
Though the cast proved to be one of the film&#x27;s greatest strengths, Friedkin had problems with casting from the start. He strongly opposed Gene Hackman as the lead, first considering Paul Newman (too expensive), then Jackie Gleason, Peter Boyle, and the columnist Jimmy Breslin, who had never acted. The studio considered Gleason box-office poison after his film &quot;Gigot&quot; had flopped several years before, Boyle declined the role out of disapproval of the film&#x27;s violence, and Breslin refused to get behind the wheel of a car, as Popeye does in an integral chase scene. Steve McQueen was also considered, but did not want to do another police film after &quot;Bullitt&quot;; moreover, as with Newman, his fee was too high. Charles Bronson was also considered for the role. Lee Marvin, James Caan, and Robert Mitchum were also considered; all turned it down. Friedkin almost settled for Rod Taylor (who had actively pursued the role, according to Hackman), another choice the studio approved, before going with Hackman.

The casting of Fernando Rey as Alain Charnier (irreverently called &quot;Frog One&quot; throughout the film) resulted from mistaken identity. Friedkin had seen Luis Buñuel&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;Belle de Jour&quot; and been impressed by the performance of Francisco Rabal, who had a small role in it. But Friedkin did not know Rabal&#x27;s name, remembering only that he was a Spanish actor. He asked his casting director to find the actor, and the casting director contacted Rey, a Spanish actor who had appeared in several other Buñuel films. Rabal was finally reached, but because he spoke neither French nor English, Rey was kept in the film.

===Comparison to actual people and events===
The plot centers on drug smuggling in the 1960s and early 1970s, when most of the heroin illegally imported into the East Coast came to the U.S. via France (&quot;see&quot; French Connection).

On April 26, 1968, a record-setting of heroin was seized, concealed in a Citroën DS and smuggled to New York on the ocean liner. The total amount smuggled during the DS&#x27;s many transatlantic voyages was , according to arrested smuggler Jacques Bousquet.

Like its two protagonists, several of the film&#x27;s other characters have real-life counterparts. Alain Charnier is based on Jean Jehan, who was later arrested in Paris for drug trafficking but not extradited, because France does not extradite its citizens. Sal Boca is based on Pasquale &quot;Patsy&quot; Fuca and his brother Anthony. Angie Boca is based on Patsy&#x27;s wife, Barbara, who later wrote a book with Robin Moore detailing her life with Patsy. The Fucas and their uncle were part of a heroin-dealing crew that worked with New York crime families.

Characters not prominently depicted in the film include the special agents and undercover operatives of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN), the federal agency primarily responsible for investigating the French Connection, who worked alongside NYPD detectives throughout most of these events until the FBN dissolved later in 1968.

Henri Devereaux, who takes the fall for importing the film&#x27;s drug-laden Lincoln into New York, is based on Jacques Angelvin, a television actor arrested and sentenced to three to six years in a federal penitentiary for his role, serving about four before returning to France and turning to real estate. According to the director&#x27;s commentary, Joel Weinstock is a composite of several similar drug-dealing financiers.

===Car chase===
The film is often cited as featuring one of the greatest car chase sequences in movie history. The chase involves Popeye commandeering a civilian&#x27;s car (a 1971 Pontiac LeMans) and frantically chasing an elevated train on which a hitman is trying to escape. The scene, coordinated by Bill Hickman, was filmed in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, roughly running under the BMT West End Line (now the , then the B train), which runs on an elevated track above Stillwell Avenue, 86th Street, and New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn, with the chase ending just north of the 62nd Street station. At that point, the train hits a train stop but is going too fast to stop in time and collides with the train ahead of it, which has just left the station.

The scene&#x27;s most famous shot is from a front bumper mount and shows the streets from a low angle. Director of photography Owen Roizman wrote in &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; magazine in 1972 that the camera was undercranked to 18 frames per second to enhance the sense of speed; this effect can be seen on a car at a red light whose exhaust pipe is pumping smoke at an accelerated rate. Other shots involved stunt drivers who were supposed to barely miss Doyle&#x27;s car, but due to errors in timing, accidental collisions occurred that were left in the film. Friedkin said he used Santana&#x27;s cover of Peter Green&#x27;s song &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; during editing to help shape the chase sequence. The song does not appear in the film, but the chase scene &quot;did have a sort of pre-ordained rhythm to it that came from the music&quot;.

The scene concludes with Doyle confronting Nicoli at the stairs leading to the elevated train track and shooting him as he tries to run back up them, as captured in a still shot used in a theatrical release poster for the film. Many of the police officers who were advisers for the film objected to the scene on the grounds that shooting a suspect in the back is murder, not self-defense, but Friedkin stood by it, saying he was &quot;secure in my conviction that that&#x27;s exactly what Eddie Egan [the model for Doyle] would have done, and Eddie was on the set while all of this was being shot&quot;.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars and ranked it one of the best films of 1971. Roger Greenspun of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The French Connection&quot; &quot;is in fact a very good new kind of movie, and that in spite of its being composed of such ancient material as cops and crooks, with thrills and chases, and lots of shoot-&#x27;em-up.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;So many changes have been made in Robin Moore&#x27;s taut, factual reprise of one of the biggest narcotics hauls in New York police history that only the skeleton remains, but producer Philip D&#x27;Antoni and screenwriter Ernest Tidyman have added enough fictional flesh to provide director William Friedkin and his overall topnotch cast with plenty of material, and they make the most of it.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded the film four stars out of four and wrote: &quot;From the moment a street-corner Santa Claus chases a drug pusher thru the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, to the final shootout on deserted Ward&#x27;s Island, &quot;The French Connection&quot; is a gutty, flatout thriller, far superior to any caper film of recent vintage.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;every bit as entertaining as &quot;Bullitt&quot;, a slam-bang, suspenseful, plain-spoken, sardonically funny, furiously paced melodrama. But because it has dropped the romance and starry glamor of Steve McQueen and added a strong sociological concern, &quot;The French Connection&quot; is even more interesting, thought-provoking and reverberating.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;an undeniably sensational movie, a fast, tense, explosively vicious little cops-and-robbers enterprise&quot; with &quot;a deliberately nervewracking, runaway quality ... It&#x27;s a cheap thrill in the same way that a roller coaster ride is a cheap thrill. It seems altogether appropriate that the showiest sequence intercuts between a runaway train and a recklessly speeding car.&quot; In his book &quot;Reverse Angle&quot;, John Simon wrote: &quot;Friedkin has used New York locations better than anyone to day,&quot; &quot;[t]he performances are all good&quot;, and &quot;Owen Roizman&#x27;s cinematography, grainy and grimy, is a brilliant rendering of urban blight.&quot;

Pauline Kael&#x27;s review in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was generally unfavorable. She wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s not what I want not because it fails (it doesn&#x27;t fail), but because of what it is. It is, I think, what we once feared mass entertainment might become: jolts for jocks. There&#x27;s nothing in the movie that you enjoy thinking about afterward—nothing especially clever except the timing of the subway-door-and-umbrella sequence. Every other effect of the movie—even the climactic car-versus-runaway-elevated-train chase—is achieved by noise, speed, and brutality.&quot; David Pirie of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called the film &quot;consistently exciting&quot; and Gene Hackman &quot;extremely convincing as Doyle, trailing his suspects with a shambling determination; but there are times when the film (or at any rate the script) seems to be applauding aspects of his character which are more repulsive than sympathetic. Whereas in &quot;The Detective&quot; or &quot;Bullitt&quot; the hero&#x27;s attention was directed unmistakably towards liberal ends (crooked businessmen, corrupt local officials, etc.) Doyle spends a fair part of his time beating up sullen blacks in alleys and bars. These violent sequences are almost all presented racily and amusingly, stressing Doyle&#x27;s &#x27;lovable&#x27; toughness as he manhandles and arrests petty criminals, usually adding a quip like &#x27;Lock them up and throw away the key.&#x27;&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 90 reviews, with an average rating of 8.80/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Realistic, fast-paced and uncommonly smart, &quot;The French Connection&quot; is bolstered by stellar performances by Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider, not to mention William Friedkin&#x27;s thrilling production.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 94% based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;Time Out&quot; listed &quot;The French Connection&quot; as the 31st-best action film of all time, according to a poll of film critics, directors, actors, and stunt actors.

Some writers have called &quot;The French Connection&quot; a neo-noir film.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;The French Connection&quot; as one of his favorite films.

Director David Fincher cited &quot;The French Connection&quot; as one of the five films that &quot;had a Profound Impact on my Life&quot; and served as an important influence on the cinematography on his film &quot;Seven&quot;; Brad Pitt cited &quot;The French Connection&quot; as a reason he participated in &quot;Seven&quot;.

Director Steven Spielberg has said he studied &quot;The French Connection&quot; in preparation for his historical action thriller film &quot;Munich&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
The American Film Institute recognizes &quot;The French Connection&quot; on several of its lists:
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies - #70
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) - #93
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years…100 Thrills - #8
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years…100 Heroes and Villains: Jimmy &quot;Popeye&quot; Doyle - #44 Hero

In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed the film as the tenth best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.

==Home media releases==
&quot;The French Connection&quot; has been issued in various home video formats. In 2001, it was released on VHS and DVD in box sets featuring both the film and its sequel, &quot;French Connection II&quot;. For a 2009 reissue on Blu-ray, Friedkin controversially altered the film&#x27;s color timing to give it a &quot;colder&quot; look. Cinematographer Owen Roizman, who was not consulted about the changes, called the new transfer &quot;atrocious&quot;. In 2012, a new Blu-ray transfer of the movie was released whose color timing both Friedkin and Roizman supervised; the 2009 edition&#x27;s desaturated and sometimes grainy look was corrected.

In 2023, media publications discovered that a version of the film available on digital platforms such as Apple TV and the Criterion Channel had been altered to excise a scene that contains racial slurs. The decision received backlash from fans and cineasts, who compared the censorship to vandalism and called out the decision for hiding its historical context. Joseph Wade compared the cut to vandalising a piece of art.

==Sequels and adaptations==
* &quot;French Connection II&quot; (1975) is a fictional sequel.
* NBC-TV aired a made-for-TV movie, &quot;Popeye Doyle&quot; (1986), another fictional sequel, starring Ed O&#x27;Neill.

<text>Nicholas and Alexandra is a 1971 British epic historical drama film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, from a screenplay by James Goldman and Edward Bond based on Robert K. Massie&#x27;s 1967 book of the same name. It tells the story of the last ruling Russian monarch, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia (Michael Jayston), and his wife, Tsarina Alexandra (Janet Suzman), from 1904 until their deaths in 1918. The ensemble cast includes Tom Baker as Grigori Rasputin, Laurence Olivier as Sergei Witte, Brian Cox as Leon Trotsky, Ian Holm as Vasily Yakovlev, Vivian Pickles as Nadezhda Krupskaya, and Irene Worth as The Queen Mother Marie Fedorovna.

The film was theatrically released on 13 December 1971 by Columbia Pictures to mixed reviews and commercial failure, grossing $7 million on a $9 million budget. Regardless, the film received six nominations at the 44th Academy Awards, including for Best Picture and Best Actress (Suzman), and won two: Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.

==Plot==
Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, wife of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, gives birth to their fifth child and first son, Alexei. Despite pleas from Grand Duke Nicholas and Count Sergei Witte, Nicholas refuses to end the Russo-Japanese War or accept demands for a constitutional monarchy, believing that doing either will make him look weak and put the Romanov dynasty at risk. As the war continues, growing public unrest sees a procession of workers march to the Winter Palace, hoping to present Nicholas with a petition calling for political representation. Soldiers open fire on the approaching crowd, killing hundreds. The resulting revolution forces Nicholas to create the Duma.

At a gala, Alexandra meets Grigori Rasputin, a self-proclaimed holy man, who she later turns to for spiritual guidance after court physicians diagnose Alexei with haemophilia. As the years pass the close relationship between the royal family and Rasputin, combined with Rasputin&#x27;s behaviour, leads to public mockery of the royal family. Nicholas eventually dismisses Rasputin from the court despite Alexandra&#x27;s pleas otherwise.

The Romanov Tercentenary celebrations occur and a lavish tour across Imperial Russia ensues, but resentment amongst the impoverished remains. Amongst the national festivities and celebrations Russian prime minister Stolypin is assassinated. Nicholas responds by executing the assassins, permitting the police to terrorize the peasants, and closes the Duma.

Following a fall at the Spała Hunting Lodge, Alexei suffers a bleeding attack so severe that it is presumed he will die. Alexandra writes to Rasputin who responds with prayer and instruction for Alexei to be left alone by the doctors. His recovery is attributed to Rasputin&#x27;s intervention and as a result he is allowed to return to the imperial household.

After the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, Nicholas orders a mobilization of the Imperial Russian Army on the European border aimed at Austria-Hungary during the July Crisis. Germany responds by declaring war, against the assumptions of Nicholas given his familial connection to the Kaiser. Later, with the war going badly for Russia on the Eastern Front, Alexandra persuades Nicholas to take personal command of the troops; he leaves for the front, relieving the weary but experienced Grand Duke Nicholas.

Alexandra is left nominally in charge upon Nicholas&#x27; absence but a series of poor decisions leaves her seen to be a German agent under the influence of Rasputin, resulting in growing unpopularity amongst the population at large as conditions worse. Nicholas receives a visit from the Dowager Empress, but her requests for him to return to St. Petersburg and remove Rasputin go unheeded. Rasputin&#x27;s later assassination does little to stop Alexandra&#x27;s misrule, culminating in revolt by workers and soldiers in St. Petersburg. Nicholas finally attempts to return to Tsarskoye Selo but is instead forced to abdicate on his train.

The family, along with a small entourage, are exiled by Alexander Kerensky and the provisional government to Siberia after none of Russia&#x27;s allies agree to grant the former royals sanctuary, fearing that the lingering resentment at their autocratic rule would unleash similar domestic revolts. The provisional government doesn&#x27;t last however following the seizing of power by the Bolsheviks and the country&#x27;s descent into civil war. Fearing that the encroaching pro-monarchist &quot;Whites&quot; will attempt to restore the Romanovs, the Bolsheviks in Moscow attempt to have the royal family brought back for trial.

En route back to the capital, the royals and their escort are intercepted by representatives of the local revolutionary government, who seize the royals and bring them to Yekaterinburg. Under harsh conditions, they are guarded by Yakov Yurovsky, who later receives orders to have the family killed. In the middle of the night the family are awoken by his men and, under the pretense they need to be transferred again, are brought to the cellar where they are executed.

==Production==
=== Development ===
Producer Spiegel tackled &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; when he was shut out from working with director David Lean on &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, which was also set against the backdrop of revolutionary Russia. Spiegel had alienated Lean when the two worked together on the film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, pressing the perfectionist director in order to get the movie finished on time.

Spiegel initially tried to make &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; without buying the rights to the book by Robert K. Massie, claiming that the historical account was in public domain but, eventually, Spiegel purchased the rights for $150,000. He hired writer James Goldman to adapt Massie&#x27;s book as a screenplay. Goldman had written the popular play and film &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;.

The first director was George Stevens who left the project. Anthony Harvey became involved in December 1968 but he left by February 1969. Ken Russell, Lindsay Anderson, and John Boorman were all approached but turned it down. Joseph L. Mankiewicz was briefly part of the project then Charles Jarrott joined in November 1969. After seeing &quot;Patton&quot;, Goldman recommended Franklin J. Schaffner who signed in July 1970.

Spiegel turned to former collaborators John Box for production design, and cinematographer Freddie Young (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;) to give the production the epic touch he felt it needed. Principal photography took place in Spain and Yugoslavia.

Spiegel had to work with stricter budget constraints from Columbia Studios than before. He had wanted Peter O&#x27;Toole as Rasputin and Vanessa Redgrave as Alexandra but was constrained. Notable actors such as Laurence Olivier, Irene Worth, Michael Redgrave and Jack Hawkins appeared in the film, but actor Rex Harrison turned down a supporting role as too small. Spiegel offered the role of the Empress to Grace Kelly who turned it down.

Tom Baker, a member of the Royal National Theatre, was recommended for the role of Rasputin by Laurence Olivier, then the director of the company.

===Filming===
Filming began in Spain in November 1970 and took twenty weeks.

==Reception==
===Critical===
Despite the detailed production design, photography, and strong performances from the cast, &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; failed to find the large audience it needed to be a financial success. However, it was chosen by the American National Board of Review as one of the Top 10 Films of 1971.

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 67% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 6.20/10. On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 57 out of 100 based on 10 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a film of exquisite taste.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; gave it two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing &quot;If the movie isn&#x27;t exactly stirring, however, it is undeniably interesting, especially after the intermission.&quot;

&quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film and Video Guide&quot; described &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; as an &quot;inflated epic of occasional interest, mainly for its sets&quot; and &quot;generally heavy going&quot;, awarding it one star from a possible four. In 2013, Alex von Tunzelmann wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;&quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; boasts terrific performances and gorgeous production design, but it&#x27;s bloated and unwieldy. There is more history here than the film-makers know what to do with.&quot; For &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Tom Hutchinson awarded the film three stars out of five, describing it as a &quot;sumptuous, if overlong, epic&quot; which &quot;shows the stretchmarks of too much padding&quot; and &quot;overwhelms us with its detail, though Tom Baker is a lot of fun as the leering mystic Rasputin&quot;. Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; described the film as &#x27;flabby&#x27;.

===Historical accuracy===
There is at least one anachronism; Peter Stolypin had been assassinated in 1911, two years before the Romanov dynasty tercentenary in which he is portrayed as being alive before being assassinated.

===Box office===
By the end of the 1970s the film had lost Columbia $3 million.

===Awards and nominations===
==Home media==
&quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; received a home video release on VHS in 1987 by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video and reissued in the 1990s by Columbia Tristar Home Video.

Its DVD release was on 27 July 1999 from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The DVD featured a vintage 14-minute featurette on the production of the film and six more minutes of scenes and dialogue not found on previous VHS tapes.

The film received a Blu-ray release in February 2013 from Twilight Time. The Blu-ray featured three featurettes on the production of the film covering the makeup, costume designs and actresses playing the Tsar&#x27;s daughters in the film. It also contained the original theatrical trailer as well as an isolated music score. The latter was presented in stereo even though the sound on the Blu-ray was presented in mono. The Blu-ray release was limited to only 3,000 copies. This film is also available for sale or rent as a video online download through both Amazon and Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store, with Amazon&#x27;s online file containing the six more minutes of scenes and dialogue that Apple&#x27;s iTunes file doesn&#x27;t.

Since his retirement in 2004 Hölldobler has worked as a research professor in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. There he is one of the founders of the Social Insect Research Group (SIRG) and the Center for Social Dynamics and Complexity.

== Research fields and publications==
Hölldobler is one of the world&#x27;s leading experts in myrmecology. His experimental and theoretical contributions cover sociobiology, behavioral ecology, and chemical ecology. His primary study subjects are social insects and in particular ants. His work has provided valuable insights into mating strategies, regulation of reproduction, the evolution of social parasitism, chemical communications, and the concept of &quot;superorganisms&quot;. Publications on these topics include:

<text>The Ants is a zoology textbook by the German entomologist Bert Hölldobler and the American entomologist E. O. Wilson, first published in 1990. It won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1991.

==Contents==
This book is primarily aimed at academics as a reference work, detailing the ants&#x27; anatomy, physiology, social organization including their caste system, altruistic behaviour, and chemical communication with pheromones, their ecology (vital for turning the soil and controlling insect pests), and natural history.

An account of some of Hölldobler and Wilson&#x27;s most interesting findings, popularized for the layman, can be found in their 1994 book &quot;Journey to the Ants&quot;.

==Reception==

The &quot;Science&quot; magazine reviewer described the book as a &quot;mighty tome&quot; and commented that it would &quot;surely take its place among the greatest of all entomology books&quot;, as it was &quot;a wonderful exploration of almost every ramification of evolutionary biology, from developmental biology to the structure of ecological communities&quot;. The illustrations are praised as lavish and extremely detailed, with monochrome drawings and 24 colour plates. All the 297 extant genera are illustrated and identifiable with the supplied keys. But &quot;&quot;The Ants&quot;, like every great book and every ant colony, is much more than the sum of its parts.&quot;

Diana Wheeler, reviewing the book in &quot;The Quarterly Review of Biology&quot;, comments that William Morton Wheeler thought his book not practical to revise as it would require too much work and would make the book too expensive, and that it was fortunate that the authors &quot;did not flinch&quot; at the challenge. They had produced a massive but affordable volume, and it was accessible to the public as well as to entomologists.

<doc id="99470" wikidata="Q809063" url="?curid=99470" title="Barry Lopez">
<text>Barry Holstun Lopez (January 6, 1945 – December 25, 2020) was an American author, essayist, nature writer, and fiction writer whose work is known for its humanitarian and environmental concerns. In a career spanning over 50 years, he visited more than 80 countries, and wrote extensively about a variety of landscapes including the Arctic wilderness, exploring the relationship between human cultures and nature. He won the National Book Award for Nonfiction for &quot;Arctic Dreams&quot; (1986) and his &quot;Of Wolves and Men&quot; (1978) was a National Book Award finalist. He was a contributor to magazines including &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;National Geographic&quot;, and &quot;The Paris Review&quot;.

==Early life==
Lopez was born Barry Holstun Brennan on January 6, 1945, in Port Chester, New York, to Mary Frances (née Holstun) and John Brennan. His family moved to Reseda, California after the birth of his brother, Dennis, in 1948. He attended grade school at Our Lady of Grace during this time. His parents divorced in 1950, after which his mother married Adrian Bernard Lopez, a businessman, in 1955. Adrian Lopez adopted Barry and his brother, and they both took his surname. Barry Lopez experienced years of sexual abuse as the victim of a serial child molester posing as a doctor who went by the name Harry Shier.

When Lopez was 11, his family relocated to Manhattan, where he attended the Loyola School, graduating in 1962. As a young man, Lopez considered becoming a Catholic priest or a Trappist monk before attending the University of Notre Dame, earning undergraduate and graduate degrees there in 1966 and 1968. He also attended New York University and the University of Oregon. Although he drifted away from Catholicism, daily prayer remained important to him as a continuous, respectful attendance to the presence of the Divine.

== Career and works ==
Lopez&#x27;s essays, short stories, reviews and opinion pieces began to appear in 1966. In his career of over 50 years, he traveled to over 80 countries, writing extensively about distant and exotic landscapes including the Arctic wilderness, exploring the relationships between human cultures and wild nature. Through his works, he also highlighted the harm caused by human actions on nature. He was a contributing editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and a contributor to many magazines including &quot;National Geographic&quot;, &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, and &quot;Outside&quot;. Until 1981, he was also a landscape photographer. In 2002, he was elected a fellow of The Explorers Club.

&quot;Arctic Dreams&quot; (1986) describes five years in the Canadian Arctic, where Lopez worked as a biologist. Robert Macfarlane, reviewing the book in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, describes him as &quot;the most important living writer about wilderness&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Michiko Kakutani argued that &quot;Arctic Dreams&quot; &quot;is a book about the Arctic North in the way that &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; is a novel about whales&quot;.

A number of Lopez&#x27;s works, including &quot;Giving Birth to Thunder, Sleeping with His Daughter&quot; (1978), make use of Native American legends, including characters such as Coyote. &quot;Crow and Weasel&quot; (1990) thematizes the importance of metaphor, which Lopez described in an interview as one of the definitive &quot;passion[s]&quot; of humanity.

James I. McClintock describes Lopez as an admirer of Wendell Berry. McClintock further observes, referring to &quot;Arctic Dreams&quot;, that Lopez &quot;conjoin[s] ecological science and romantic insight&quot;. Slovic identifies &quot;careful structure, euphony, and an abundance of particular details&quot; as central characteristics of Lopez&#x27;s work.

His final work published during his lifetime was &quot;Horizon&quot; (2019), an autobiographical telling of his travels over his lifetime. &quot;The Guardian&quot; describes the book as &quot;a contemporary epic, at once pained and urgent, personal and oracular&quot;. A collection of essays, some of which had previously been published and others of which were new to the public, was published posthumously by Penguin Random House under the title &quot;Embrace Fearlessly the Burning World&quot; (2022), with an introduction by Rebecca Solnit.

An archive of Lopez&#x27;s manuscripts and other work has been established at Texas Tech University, where he was the university&#x27;s Visiting Distinguished Scholar. He also taught at universities including Columbia University, Eastern Washington University, University of Iowa, and Carleton College, Minnesota.

== Personal life ==
Lopez&#x27;s first marriage to Sandra Landers in 1967 ended in a divorce in 1998. He married Debra Gwartney in 2007. After the property surrounding their long-term home near Finn Rock on the McKenzie River in western Oregon was burned in the 2020 Holiday Farm Fire, the couple moved temporarily to Eugene, Oregon.

Lopez died on December 25, 2020, from complications of prostate cancer, in Eugene, Oregon.

<text>The Westermarck effect, also known as reverse [[sexual imprinting]], is a psychological hypothesis that states that people tend not to be attracted to peers with whom they lived like siblings before the age of six. This hypothesis was first proposed by Finnish anthropologist Edvard Westermarck in his book &quot;The History of Human Marriage&quot; (1891) as one explanation for the incest taboo.

== Research since Westermarck ==
The Westermarck effect has gained some empirical support. Proponents point to evidence from the Israeli kibbutz system, from the Chinese Shim-pua marriage customs, and from closely related families.

In the case of the Israeli kibbutzim (collective farms), children were reared somewhat communally in peer groups, based on age, not biological relations. A study of the marriage patterns of these children later in life revealed that out of the nearly 3,000 marriages that occurred across the kibbutz system, only 14 were between children from the same peer group. Of those 14, none had been reared together during the first six years of life. This result suggests that the Westermarck effect operates from birth to at least the age of six.

In Shim-pua marriages, a girl would be adopted into a family as the future wife of a son, often an infant at that time. These marriages often failed, as would be expected according to the Westermarck hypothesis.

Studies show that cousin-marriage in Lebanon has a lower success rate if the cousins were raised in sibling-like conditions, first-cousin unions being more successful in Pakistan if there was a substantial age difference, as well as reduced marital appeal for cousins who grew up sleeping in the same room in Morocco. Evidence also indicates that siblings separated for extended periods of time since childhood were more likely to report having engaged in sexual activity with one another.

Eran Shor and Dalit Simchai revisited the kibbutzim results and found sexual attraction where it had not been acted on. They conclude that any innate aversion needs to be backed up by social pressures and norms.

<text>Iona was a progressive Celtic Christian rock band from the United Kingdom. It was formed in the late 1980s by lead vocalist Joanne Hogg and multi-instrumentalists David Fitzgerald and Dave Bainbridge. Troy Donockley joined later, playing the uilleann pipes, low whistles, and other instruments.

==History==
When Iona released their first self-titled album in 1990, drummer Terl Bryant, bassist Nick Beggs (formerly the bassist of Kajagoogoo), Fiona Davidson on Celtic harp, Peter Whitfield on strings, Troy Donockley on Uilleann pipes, and percussionist Frank van Essen had joined the band. The first album &quot;Iona&quot; is mostly about the history of the island of Iona, from which the band got its name.

Iona returned in 1992 with &quot;The Book of Kells&quot;, a concept album with several tracks based on pages from the eponymous book. Terl Bryant took over on drums and percussion for the album after the Frank van Essen left. Fitzgerald left that year to pursue a degree in music.

&quot;Beyond These Shores&quot;, the band&#x27;s third album, was released in 1993 and included guest musician Robert Fripp. The album was loosely based on the legendary voyage of St. Brendan to the Americas before Christopher Columbus; the band did not intend for it to be viewed strictly as a &quot;concept album&quot;.

&quot;Journey into the Morn&quot; was released in 1995, a more accessible and rock-oriented album loosely based on the hymn &quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot;. It is sung in Gaelic at the beginning of the album and again near the end. Máire Brennan, the lead singer of Celtic and new-age band Clannad, was brought in to help Hogg with the Gaelic pronunciation; Brennan also sang backup vocals.

Two live albums followed in the late 1990s: the double-disc &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Bright Sun&quot; and &quot;Woven Cord&quot;, which was performed with the All Souls Orchestra. Between these two albums Teri Bryant departed, and Frank van Essen returned, playing drums as well as violin. Frank van Essen is featured on the band&#x27;s 2000 album, &quot;Open Sky&quot;.

After being released from their U.S. contract with ForeFront Records and their U.K. contract with Alliance Records, Iona formed Open Sky Records to release material independently. The first new release on the label was the 2002 box set &quot;The River Flows&quot;, which featured their then-out-of-print first three albums (all remastered and several first album tracks were even re-recorded), as well as a fourth disc of unreleased tracks and rarities called &quot;Dunes.&quot; The first three albums have since been re-released individually with new cover art.

Next the group was in semi-hiatus for nearly a decade. A two-disc live DVD &quot;Iona: Live in London&quot; was released in April 2006. It features a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround mix by John Kellogg, who is from Los Angeles. In November 2006 came the release of a new studio album: &quot;The Circling Hour&quot;.

In June 2009 Troy Donockley announced that he was leaving Iona. A message on his website said: &quot;I have had a wonderful time with my friends in Iona and am very, very proud of the albums we made together. But, as in all life, things change. After extended periods of no activity we have found ourselves with a very different musical and philosophical direction. We have parted as great friends should, with a sad-happiness and I wish the band all the very best wishes for the future&quot;. 

Donockley went on to become a member of punk and folk band The Bad Shepherds; he has played in Barbara Dickson&#x27;s band for a number of years and is the band&#x27;s musical director as well as playing with Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, with whom he has made many guest appearances both live and on their albums over recent years, before joining them as a full-time member in October 2013. He has been replaced in Iona by piper and woodwind player Martin Nolan.

In June 2010, Iona went to the United States for their first tour there in nine years. On 19 June 2010, they played a very well received concert at NEARfest, a progressive rock festival in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; during the show they introduced new songs for an album, &quot;Another Realm&quot;, which was released in 2011 and is their final album. After several concerts throughout the U.S. and one in Canada, they ended the tour at Cornerstone Festival, a Christian music festival in Illinois, on 30 June. On 11 December 2016, the band announced on its Facebook page that it was suspending recording and touring as a group, citing other commitments. &quot;We do not know what will happen in future years, whether we will get together again as Iona,&quot; the band said. &quot;The door will remain open, but for the foreseeable future, the next and exciting chapters of our journey will involve other avenues.&quot;
In March 2024, Bainbridge announced that he would join with Sally Minnear to perform Iona music as a duo on a UK tour in July.

<text>Rephlex Records was a record label launched in 1991 in Cornwall by electronic musician Richard D. James (aka Aphex Twin) and Grant Wilson-Claridge. The label coined the term &quot;braindance&quot; to describe the output of Aphex Twin and fellow artists.

==History==
In 1989, Grant Wilson-Claridge met Richard D. James (a.k.a. Aphex Twin) DJing at The Bowgie, a club located just along the coast from Newquay, Cornwall. According to Wilson-Claridge, back in 1989, &quot;the Bowgie was the best club ever...this was before Newquay turned into the Cornish Ibiza&quot; and it was very difficult to hear new and interesting music. Wilson-Claridge and James used to DJ on alternate weeks. When he noticed that James was playing his own tapes rather than records, Wilson-Claridge suggested that they press up some records. In the beginning, committing Aphex Twin recordings to vinyl was a way of making music the duo&#x27;s friends wanted to hear. Due to their geographical dis-location they did not have access to the music they wanted to hear and so they decided to create their own, and Rephlex as a label was born. Although the label was founded in 1991 in Cornwall, it moved the year after to London.

On a post to an internet newsgroup in 1992, the label stated that its intent was to &quot;promote Innovation in the dynamics of Acid&quot; – a much loved and misunderstood genre of house music&quot; and to &quot;demonstrate to the rest of the world that British dance music can be entirely original&quot;.

Rephlex has released the music of many electronic artists, among them Mike Paradinas, DMX Krew, Luke Vibert, Aleksi Perälä and Squarepusher. The label has also remastered and re-released the early works of 808 State and the Future Sound of London, and relaunched the career of electronic duo producers Black Devil with a re-release of their first record.

In 2014, James announced the closing of Rephlex Records. He stated that the closure was &quot;something that needed to be done a long time ago. Me and my friend would have drifted apart, but actually the label did keep us together. It got to a point where I’d actually rather be his friend than be in business with him.&quot;

<text>Heinrich Isaac (ca. 1450 – 26 March 1517) was a Netherlandish composer of south Netherlandish origin during the Renaissance era. He wrote masses, motets, songs (in French, German and Italian), and instrumental music. A significant contemporary of Josquin des Prez, Isaac influenced the development of music in Germany. Several variants exist of his name: Ysaac, Ysaak, Henricus, Arrigo d&#x27;Ugo, and Arrigo il Tedesco among them. (&quot;Tedesco&quot; means &quot;Flemish&quot; or &quot;German&quot; in Italian.)

== Early life ==
Little is known about Isaac&#x27;s early life (or indeed what he called himself), but it is probable that he was born in the Brabant. During the late 15th century, standards of music education in the region were excellent, and he was probably educated in his homeland, although the location is not known. Sixteenth-century Swiss music theorist and writer Heinrich Glarean claimed Isaac for Germany by dubbing him &quot;Henricus Isaac Germanus&quot;, but in his will Isaac called himself by the patronymic &quot;Ugonis de Flandria&quot;, &#x27;Hugo&#x27;s [son] from Flanders&#x27;. A writer in the Milanese &quot;Revista critica della letteratura italiana&quot;, June 1886, speculated that this patronymic might be connected to &#x27;Huygens&#x27; and discovered the name &quot;Isaacke&quot; in the town archives of Bruges.

== Career ==

Heinrich Isaac&#x27;s career spanned well over thirty years and allowed him to travel far from his homeland of Flanders into Germany, Italy, and Austria, as well as other parts of central Europe. While the absence of plentiful primary sources makes it hard for us to map out Isaac&#x27;s life, piecing together the sources we do have along with the works he wrote gives us a good picture of just how popular this Franco-Flemish composer was in his time. Isaac was probably writing music by the 1470s, and the first document mentioning his name dates back to 15 September 1484, placing him in Innsbruck as a singer for Duke Sigismund of Austria, of the House of Habsburg. The following year Isaac migrated to Florence, since documents show that by July 1485 Isaac had become employed as a singer at the church Santa Maria del Fiore. By the middle of 1491, he was designated as a singer at Santissima Annunziata, a position that he held until 1493.

Several documents illustrate Isaac&#x27;s long stay in Florence under the employment of Santa Maria del Fiore and Santissima Annunziata as a singer, and also suggest that he may have developed a close working-relationship with Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. It is speculated that it was Medici who may have summoned Isaac to Florence from Innsbruck in 1484. Previously, Isaac had been identified as an organist to Lorenzo but the Isaac who served at this post is now known to have been Isaac Argyropoulos. During his presence in Florence from 1484 until the end of 1496, Isaac probably composed several masses, motets and secular songs, including missa &quot;J&#x27;ay pris amours&quot; and the carnival song &quot;Hora è di Maggio&quot;. In 1487 Isaac composed the piece &quot;A la battaglia&quot; to commemorate the battle between Genoa and Florence for the castle Sarzanello although there is much debate over the exact date and purpose of the piece. Isaac&#x27;s relationship with Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici must have been fairly close, because allegedly between 1488 and 1489 he composed the music for a play called &quot;San Giovanni e San Paolo&quot;, written by Medici himself. Moreover, when Lorenzo died in April 1492 Isaac composed two motets in his memory. Lorenzo&#x27;s son Piero inherited everything he owned, including his musical groups. In September 1492 Piero took his musical groups to Rome to perform for the coronation of Pope Alexander VI. Records show that Isaac was one of the three singers for whom clothing was purchased for the trip, implying that he probably performed for the Pope.

During his first stay in Florence Isaac also had dealings with a Florentine named Piero Bello, whose daughter Bartolomea was Isaac&#x27;s wife. Although the actual date of the marriage is unknown, records imply that it may have been arranged for Isaac by Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici when he summoned Isaac from Flanders. There is record of Piero Bello giving Isaac a dowry for his daughter in January 1495.

In November 1496 after Isaac and his wife spent some time in Pisa, they moved to Vienna and became employed by Emperor Maximilian I. By the winter of 1496 Isaac and Bartolomea had gone from Pisa to Vienna to Innsbruck, and on 3 April 1497, Isaac was appointed court composer for Maximilian I. He remained under Maximilian&#x27;s employment from 1496 until his death, although he did not remain stationary during that period. In fact, Isaac traveled extensively around Europe north of Italy. Payment documents from Maximilian&#x27;s court imply Isaac traveled with the court to Torgau, Augsburg, Nürnberg, Wels, and back to Innsbruck between 1497 and 1501.

In 1502, Isaac returned to Italy, going to Florence to make arrangements with the hospital Santa Maria Nuova; payments were made to the hospital in return for health and food provisions. Recently discovered documents offer evidence that Isaac began making yearly payments to the confraternity of Santa Barbara for mutual assistance. On 15 August 1502, Isaac wrote his first will which included names of his proprietors, alluding to the fact that he was doing well to care for his wife and property should anything happen to him. He then traveled to Ferrara to the Este court where he wrote the motet &quot;La mi la sol la sol la mi&quot; in merely two days and competed with Josquin for employment: a famous letter from the agent of the Este family compared the two composers, saying that &quot;[Isaac] is of a better disposition among his companions, and he will compose new works more often. It is true that Josquin composes better, but he composes when he wants to and not when one wants him to.&quot;

Between 1505 and 1512 there are records of Isaac having dealings in Augsburg, Florence and Constance (see Konstanz), the latter in which he compiled his largest set of works: &quot;Choralis Constantinus&quot;. This monumental collection of mass propers was commissioned by the Constance cathedral on 14 April 1508 and completed by Isaac and his student Ludwig Senfl by the winter of 1509. Isaac and Bartolomea were almost definitely back in Florence by this time since the completed &quot;Choralis Constantinus&quot; had to be mailed to the cathedral.

On 4 January 1512 Isaac bartered his house in Florence for a smaller one, signifying his settling down. He and his wife probably remained there except for a few short trips until his death. Isaac also made a point to revise his will on 24 November 1512 in which he requested that a mass be said every year forever at Santissima Annunziata or another church should Annunziata be unable. Bartolomea would be able to pay for these masses with provisions. On the recommendation of Pope Leo X and of his brother Giuliano de&#x27; Medici, he was given an honorary position as chief of the Chapel of Polyphonic Music at Santa Maria del Fiore on 30 May 1514, which served as a pension. Isaac also continued to receive payments from the court of Maximilian I regardless of his living in Florence. In December 1515, Pope Leo X made a visit to Florence, where he almost certainly would have heard Isaac&#x27;s music performed. Shortly before his death, Isaac wrote a third and final will, which shortened his previous request to instead have a commemorative mass said every year for ten years. Isaac died on 26 March 1517. Santissima Annunziata received payment the following day to hold his funeral. A last posthumous donation was made to the confraternity of Santa Barbara in the amount of five florins, which was equal to one quarter the value of Isaac&#x27;s home. Bartolomea survived her husband by just over seventeen years and died on 30 May 1534.

== Compositions ==

Isaac was one of the most prolific composers of the time, producing an extraordinarily diverse output, including almost all the forms and styles current at the time; only Lassus, at the end of the 16th century, had a wider overall range. Music composed by Isaac included masses, motets, songs in French, German, and Italian, as well as instrumental music. His best known work may be the song &quot;Innsbruck, ich muss dich lassen&quot;, of which he made at least two versions. It is possible, however, that the melody itself is not by Isaac, and only the setting is original. The same melody was later used as the theme for the Lutheran hymn &quot;O Welt, ich muss dich lassen&quot;, which was the basis of works by Johann Sebastian Bach, including his &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; and Johannes Brahms.

Of his settings of the ordinary of the mass, 36 survive; others are believed to have been lost. Numerous individual movements of masses survive as well. But it is composition of music for the Proper of the Mass – the portion of the liturgy which changed on different days, unlike the ordinary, which remained constant – which gave him his greatest fame. The huge cycle of motets which he wrote for the mass Proper, the &quot;Choralis Constantinus&quot;, and which he left incomplete at his death, would have supplied music for 100 separate days of the year.

Isaac is held in high regard for his &quot;Choralis Constantinus&quot;. It is a huge anthology of over 450 chant-based polyphonic motets for the Proper of the Mass. It had its origins in a commission that Isaac received from the Cathedral in Konstanz, Germany in April 1508 to set many of the Propers unique to the local liturgy. Isaac was in Konstanz because Maximilian had called a meeting of the Reichstag (German Parliament of nobles) there and Isaac was on hand to provide music for the Imperial court chapel choir. After the deaths of both Maximilian and Isaac, Ludwig Senfl, who had been Isaac&#x27;s pupil as a member of the Imperial court choir, gathered all the Isaac settings of the Proper and placed them into liturgical order for the church year. But the anthology was not published until 1555, after Senfl&#x27;s death, by which time the reforms of the Council of Trent had made many of the texts obsolete. The motets remain some of the finest examples of chant-based Renaissance polyphony in existence.

Isaac composed a 6-voice motet &quot;Angeli Archangeli&quot; for the Feast of All Saint&#x27;s Day, honoring angels, archangels, and all other saints. Another famous motet by Isaac is &quot;Optime pastor&quot; (&quot;Optime divino&quot;), written for the accession to the papacy of Medici pope Leo X. This motet compares the Pope to a shepherd capable of soothing all of his flock and binding them together.

While in the service of the Medici in Florence, Isaac wrote a lament on the death of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, &quot;Quis dabit capiti meo aquam&quot; (1492), which set words by Lorenzo&#x27;s favorite poet, Angelo Poliziano.

== Influence ==

The influence of Isaac was especially pronounced in Germany, due to the connection he maintained with the Habsburg court. He was the first significant master of the Franco-Flemish polyphonic style who both lived in German-speaking areas, and whose music was widely distributed there. It was through him that the polyphonic style of the Netherlands became widely accepted in Germany, making possible the further development of contrapuntal music there.
The Austrian serialist composer Anton Webern (1883–1945) gained his PhD on Isaac&#x27;s Choralis Constantinus, with Prof. Guido Adler, the doyen of musicology in Austria and Germany.

Gameplay includes Capture the Flag, base defense, racing and deathmatches. &quot;XPilot&quot; uses a client–server architecture, in which a central metaserver receives information from all &quot;XPilot&quot; servers on the Internet.

== History ==
In 1991, Bjørn Stabell and Ken Schouten, then computer science undergraduates at the University of Tromsø, began writing &quot;XPilot&quot;, inspired by the earlier game &quot;Thrust&quot;. It was originally developed in C on HP9000 workstations which ran Unix. Soon after its first public release in 1992, Stabell and Schouten began receiving feedback, suggestions, and patches from players all around the world. Other &quot;XPilot&quot; users wrote documentation and contributed source code to the project. By 1996, there were nearly one hundred &quot;XPilot&quot; servers worldwide.

XPilot&#x27;s code has been forked several times. XPilot5 is a complete rewrite of &quot;XPilot&quot; in C++. Unlike its predecessor, it comes with sound and is bundled with applications to configure the keyboard, ship shapes and behavior. The latest stable version of &quot;XPilot5&quot; is 5.0.0. In late 2000, another group of developers began a branch of &quot;XPilot&quot;, later labeled XPilot NG (for next generation). Programmed in C, it contains two clients, either X11-based or SDL/OpenGL-based. Unlike the block-based maps of the original game, &quot;XPilot NG&quot; provides high frame rates and polygon maps. A new Java based map editor provides better map editing facilities. The latest version of &quot;XPilot NG&quot; is 4.7.2. In 2009, 7b5 Labs released XPilot iPhone, an &quot;XPilot&quot; client for Apple&#x27;s iPhone and iPod Touch. It is based on &quot;XPilot&quot; and &quot;XPilot NG&quot; and uses touchscreen controls. While these modern versions implement many new features, they are mostly compatible with the original program.

== Gameplay ==
The metaserver contains a list of all XPilot maps on the Internet. These maps, created by users, feature several types of gameplay. In deathmatches, points are earned by destroying other players or robots. Users can increase their firepower by picking up items such as missiles, mines and lasers. Players can also defend themselves by gathering cloaks, shields, ECMs and armor. In racing maps, players earn points based on their finishing position. The objective of team games is to &quot;destroy&quot; the opponent&#x27;s ball by placing it in the treasure chest. Team games may also be run in a slightly different Capture the flag mode. Other modes exist, like trying to survive as long as possible surrounded by cannons, by dodging the bullets, or combinations of different modes.

== Community ==
&quot;XPilot&quot;″s in-game chat and multiplayer functionality spawned the formation of a community. Contact between players was facilitated by newsgroups such as &quot;alt.games.xpilot&quot; and later &quot;rec.games.computer.xpilot&quot;. Since 1991, several annual team tournaments, known as &quot;Cups&quot;, have been held. After the first HTML and image-rendering web browsers were introduced, members of the community developed the game&#x27;s online documentation.

<text>Deathmatch, also known as free-for-all, is a gameplay mode integrated into many shooter games, including first-person shooter (FPS), and real-time strategy (RTS) video games, where the goal is to kill (or &quot;frag&quot;) the other players&#x27; characters as many times as possible. The deathmatch may end on a &quot;frag limit&quot; or a &quot;time limit&quot;, and the winner is the player that accumulated the greatest number of frags.

The deathmatch is an evolution of competitive multiplayer modes found in game genres such as fighting games and racing games moving into other genres.

== Gameplay ==

In a typical first-person shooter (FPS) deathmatch session, players connect individual computers together via a computer network in a peer-to-peer model or a client–server model, either locally or over the Internet. Players often have the option to communicate with each other during the game by using microphones and speakers.

Deathmatches have different rules and goals depending on the game, but an example of a typical FPS-deathmatch session is where every player is versus every other player. The game begins with each player being &quot;spawned&quot; (starting) at random locations—picked from a fixed predefined set. Being spawned entails having the score, health, armor and equipment reset to default values which usually is 0 score, full (100%) health, no armour and a basic firearm and a melee weapon. After a session has commenced, arbitrary players may join and leave the game on an ad hoc basis.

=== Players ===
In this context a &quot;player&quot; is a human operated character in the game or a character operated by a computer software AI—a &quot;bot&quot;. Both the human and computer operated character do have the same basic visual appearance but will in most modern games be able to select a &quot;skin&quot; which is an arbitrary graphics model but that operates on the same set of movements as the base model. A human player&#x27;s character and computer bot&#x27;s character features the same set of physical properties, initial health, initial armour, weapon capabilities, the same available character maneuvers and speed—i.e. they are equally matched except for the actual controlling part. For a novice player the difference (i.e. experience, not taking into account the actual skill) between a human opponent and a computer controlled opponent may be near nil, however for a skilled player the lack of human intelligence is usually easily noticed in most bot implementations; regardless of the actual skill of the bot—which lack of intelligence can be at least somewhat compensated for in terms of e.g. extreme (superhuman) accuracy and aim. However, some systems deliberately inform the player when inspecting the score list which player(s) are bots and which are human (e.g. OpenArena). In the event that the player is aware of the nature of the opponent it will affect the cognitive process of the player regardless of the player&#x27;s skill.

Modern implementations allow for new players to join after the game has started, the maximum number of players that can join is arbitrary for each game, map and rules and can be selected by the server. Some maps are suitable for small numbers of players, some are suitable for larger numbers.

===Deaths===
The goal for each player is killing the other players by any means possible which counts as a frag, either by direct assault or manipulating the map, the latter counts as a frag in some games, some not; in either case—to attain the highest score—this process should be repeated as many times as possible, with each iteration performed as quickly as possible. The session may have a time limit, a frag limit, or no limit at all. If there is a limit then the player with the most frags will eventually win when the session ends.
The health variable will determine if a player is wounded; however, a wounded player does not entail reduced mobility or functionality in most games, and in most games a player will not bleed to death. A player will die when the health value reaches equal to or less than 0, if the value is reduced to a very low negative value, the result may be gibbing depending upon the game.

In most games, when a player dies (i.e. is fragged), the player will lose all equipment gained and the screen will continue to display the visible (still animated) scene that the player normally sees, and the score list is usually displayed—the frags. The display does not go black when the player dies. Usually the player can choose to instantly respawn or remain dead.

The armor variable affects the health variable by reducing the damage taken, the reduction in health is &quot;in concept&quot; inversely proportional to the value of the armor times the actual damage caused; with the obvious differences in various implementations. Some games may account for the location of the body injured when the damage is deduced, while many—especially older implementations—do not. In most games, no amount of armor causes any reduced mobility—i.e. is never experienced as a weight issue by the player.

The lost equipment (usually not including the armor) of a dead player can usually be picked up by any player (even the fragged player, respawned) who gets to it first.

===Simulation===
Newtonian physics are often only somewhat accurately simulated, common in many games is the ability of the player to modify the player&#x27;s own vector to some degree while airborne, e.g. by retarding a forward airborne flight by moving backwards, or even jumping around a corner. Other notable concepts derived from the physics of FPS game engines are i.a. at least bunny-hopping, strafe-jumping and rocket-jumping—in all of which the player exploits the particular characteristics of the physics engine in question to obtain a high speed and/or height, or other attribute(s); e.g. with rocket-jumping the player will jump and fire at rocket at the floor area immediately under the feet of the same player, which will cause the player to jump higher compared to a regular jump as a result of the rocket blast (at the obvious expense of the health variable being somewhat reduced from self-inflicted injury). The types of techniques available and how the techniques may be performed by the player differs from the physics implementation as is as such also game dependent.

Most modern deathmatch games features a high level of graphic violence; a normal modern implementation will contain high quality human characters being killed, e.g. moderate amounts of blood, screams of pain and death, exploding bodies with associated &quot;gibs&quot; are common. Some games feature a way to disable and/or reduce the level of gore. However, the setting of the game is usually that of a fictional world, the player may resurrect in the form of mentioned &quot;respawning&quot; and the characters will usually have superhuman abilities, e.g. able to tolerate numerous point blank hits from a machine gun directly to the head without any armour, jumping extreme inhuman distances and falling extreme distances to mention a few things. These factors together may make the player experience the game less real as the game contains highly unreal and unrealistic elements.

===Powerups===
All normal maps will contain various power-ups; i.e. extra health, armor, ammunition and other (more powerful than default) weapons. Once collected by a player the power-up will respawn after a defined time at the same location, the time for an item to respawn depends upon the game mode and the type of the item. In some deathmatch modes power-ups will not respawn at all.

Certain power-ups are especially powerful, which can often lead to the game rotating around &quot;controlling power-ups&quot;—i.e. all other things being equal, the player who controls the strongest power-ups (collecting the items most often) is the one that will have the best potential for making the best score.

===Sessions===
If the session does have a frag or time limit a new session will start briefly after the current session has been concluded, during the respite the players will be allowed to observe the score list, chat and will usually see an animated pseudo overview display of the map as background for the score list. Some games have a system to allow each player to announce they are now ready to begin the new session, some do not. The new sessions might be on a different map—based on a map list kept on the server—or it might always be on the same map if there is no such rotating map list.

Common in many games is some form of message broadcast and private message system; the broadcast message system announces public events, e.g. if a player died it will often be informed who died and how, if fragged, then often by what weapon; the same system will also often announce if a player joins or leaves the game, and may announce how many frags are left in total and other important messages, including errors or warnings from the game; instant text messages from other players are also displayed with this system. The private message system, in contrast, only prints messages for individual players, e.g. if player A picks up a weapon, player A will get a message to confirm that the weapon was picked up.

== History ==

Even before the term &quot;deathmatch&quot; was first used, there existed games with a similar gameplay mode. &quot;MIDI Maze&quot; was a multiplayer first-person shooter for the Atari ST, released in 1987, which has been suggested as the first example of deathmatch gameplay. Sega&#x27;s 1988 third-person shooter arcade game &quot;Last Survivor&quot; featured eight-player deathmatch. Another early example of a deathmatch mode in a first-person shooter was Taito&#x27;s 1992 video game &quot;Gun Buster&quot;. It allowed two-player cooperative gameplay for the mission mode, and featured an early deathmatch mode, where either two players could compete against each other or up to four players could compete in a team deathmatch, consisting of two teams with two players each competing against each other.

The phrase &quot;death match&quot; was originally used in wrestling, starting in the 1950s, to denote certain brutal hardcore wrestling fights. The term &quot;death match&quot; in this sense appeared in the 1992 fighting arcade game &quot;World Heroes&quot;, where it denotes a game mode taking place in an arena with environmental hazards.

The term &quot;deathmatch&quot; in the context of multiplayer video games may have been coined by game designer John Romero, while he and lead programmer John Carmack were developing the LAN multiplayer mode for the video game &quot;Doom&quot;. Romero commented on the birth of the FPS deathmatch:
: &quot;Sure, it was fun to shoot monsters, but ultimately these were soulless creatures controlled by a computer. Now gamers could play against spontaneous human beings—opponents who could think and strategize and scream. We can kill each other!&#x27; If we can get this done, this is going to be the fucking coolest game that the planet Earth has ever fucking seen in its entire history!&#x27;&quot;

According to Romero, the deathmatch concept was inspired by fighting games. At id Software, the team frequently played &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; during breaks, while developing elaborate rules involving trash-talk and smashing furniture or tech. Romero stated that &quot;what we were doing was something that invented &quot;deathmatch&quot;&quot; and that &quot;Japanese fighting games fueled the creative impulse to create &quot;deathmatch&quot; in our shooters.&quot;

Some games give a different name to these types of matches, while still using the same underlying concept. For example, in &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, the name &quot;Combat&quot; is used and in &quot;Halo&quot;, deathmatch is known as &quot;Slayer&quot;.

=== Precursors ===

It has been suggested that in 1983, Drew Major and Kyle Powell probably played the world&#x27;s first deathmatch with Snipes, a text-mode game that was later credited with being the inspiration behind Novell NetWare, although multiplayer games spread across multiple screens predate that title by at least 9 years in the form of Spasim and Maze War.

Early evidence of the term&#x27;s application to graphical video games exists. On August 6, 1982, Intellivision game developers Russ Haft and Steve Montero challenged each other to a game of Bi-Planes, a 1981 Intellivision release in which multiple players control fighter planes with the primary purpose of repeatedly killing each other until a limit is reached. Once killed, a player would be respawned in a fixed location, enjoying a short period of protection from attacks. The contest was referred to, at that time, as a deathmatch.

== Variations ==

In a team deathmatch, the players are organized into two or more teams, with each team having its own frag count. Friendly fire may or may not cause damage, depending on the game and the rules used — if it does, players that kill a teammate (called a team kill) usually decrease their own score and the team&#x27;s score by one point; in certain games, they may also themselves be killed as punishment, and/or may be removed from the game for repeat offenses. The team with the highest frag-count at the end wins.

In a last man standing deathmatch (or a battle royale game), players start with a certain number of lives (or just one, in the case of battle royale games), and lose these as they die. Players who run out of lives are eliminated for the rest of the match, and the winner is the last and only player with at least one life. See the &quot;Fundamental changes&quot; section in the &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; article for more insight.

Any arbitrary multiplayer game with the goal for each player to kill every other player(s) as many times as possible can be considered to be a form of deathmatch.
In real time strategy games, deathmatch can refer to a game mode where all players begin their empires with large amounts of resources. This saves them the time of accumulation and lets hostilities commence much faster and with greater force. Destroying all the enemies is the only way to win, while in other modes some other victory conditions may be used (king of the hill, building a wonder...)

== History, fundamental changes ==

=== &quot;Doom&quot; ===
The first-person shooter version of deathmatch, originating in &quot;Doom&quot; by id Software, had a set of unmodifiable rules concerning weapons, equipment and scoring, known as &quot;Deathmatch 1.0&quot;.

* Items do not respawn, e.g. health, armour, ammunition; however weapons had a fixed status as available to any arbitrary player except the player who acquired the weapon — i.e. the weapon did not in fact disappear as items do when picked up. The player who acquires the weapon can only collect it anew after respawning (this sometimes leads to lack of ammunition if a player survives long enough, eventually leading to one&#x27;s death due to being unable to fight back)
* Suicide (such as falling into lava or causing an explosion too close to the player, or getting crushed by a crushing ceiling etc.) did not entail negative score points.
Within months, these rules were modified into &quot;Deathmatch 2.0&quot; rules (included in Doom v1.2 patch). These rules were optional, the administrator of the game could decide on using DM 1.0 or DM 2.0 rules.

The changes were:

* Picking up an object removes it from the map.
* Objects re-appear 30 seconds after being picked up and can be picked up by anyone; bonus objects which provide significant advantages (invisibility power-up etc.) re-appear after much longer delay, some of them may not reappear at all.
* Suicide counts as −1 frag.

Notable power-ups that are featured in most consecutive games include the &quot;soul spheres&quot;. Although the name and/or graphics may be different in other games the &quot;concept and feature&quot; of the power-up remains the same in other games.

=== &quot;Corridor 7: Alien Invasion&quot; CD version ===
&quot;Corridor 7: Alien Invasion&quot; released by Capstone Software in 1994.
*The first FPS to include multiple character classes.
*The first FPS to include DM specific maps.

=== &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; ===
&quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; was first released as shareware in 1994 by Apogee Software, Ltd. and honed an expansive multiplayer mode that pioneered a variety of deathmatch features.

*It introduced the Capture the Flag mode to the first-person-shooter genre as &quot;Capture the Triad&quot;.
*It was the first FPS to have an in-game scoreboard.
*It was the first FPS to deliver its level of multiplayer customization through a plethora of options affecting aspects of the level played like gravity or weapon persistence.
*It was the first FPS to have voice macros and the ability to talk to players via microphone.
*It introduced a unique point system that awards different numbers of points for different kills (for instance, a missile kill is worth a point more than a bullet kill).

=== &quot;Hexen: Beyond Heretic&quot; ===
&quot;&quot; released by Raven Software in 1995.
*The first to feature multiple character classes with their own weapons; some items also functioned differently based on the class using them.

=== &quot;Quake&quot; ===
*&quot;Quake&quot; released in 1996 by ID Software, was the first FPS deathmatch game to feature in-game joining.
*&quot;Quake&quot; was the first FPS deathmatch game to feature AI operated deathmatch players (bots), although not as a feature of the released product, but rather in the form of a community created content.
*&quot;Quake&quot; popularized rocket-jumping&quot;.

Notable power-ups that are featured in most consecutive games are i.a. the quad damage. Although the name and/or graphics may be different in other games the &quot;concept and feature&quot; of the power-up remains the same in other games.

=== &quot;Unreal&quot; ===
With the game &quot;Unreal&quot; (1998, by Epic), the rules were enhanced with some widely accepted improvements:

* spawn protection (usually 2–4 seconds), which is a period of invulnerability after a player (re)enters combat (such as after being killed and respawning); spawn protection was automatically terminated when the player used a weapon (including non-attack usage, such as zooming the sniper rifle). Spawn protection prevents &quot;easy frags&quot; — killing a player which just spawned and is slightly disoriented and almost unarmed.
* &quot;suicide-cause tracking&quot; – if a player dies by &quot;suicide&quot; that was caused by some other player&#x27;s action, such as knocking him off the cliff or triggering a crusher or gas chamber, the player that caused such death is credited the kill and the killed player does not lose a frag (it&#x27;s not counted as a suicide). This concept increases the entertainment potential of the game (as it gives players options to be &quot;cunning&quot;), but it at the same time adds complexity, which may be the reason why Epic&#x27;s main competitor, Id software, did not implement this concept into &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; (just as they did not implement spawn protection).

=== &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; ===

* &quot;combat achievements tracking&quot; – &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; (1999, by Epic) added statistics tracking. The range of statistics being tracked is very wide, such as:
** precision of fire with each weapon (percentage of hits to fired ammunition)
** kills with each weapon, being killed by particular weapon, and being killed when holding particular weapon.
** headshots (lethal hits of combatant heads with sniper rifles and some other powerful weapons)
** killing sprees: Killing 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 combatants without dying is called a killing spree, each greater kill count being considered more valuable and having a unique title (respectively; Killing Spree, Rampage, Dominating, Unstoppable, Godlike). The game tracked how many times has the player achieved each of these titles.
* consecutive kills: when a player kills a combatant within 5 seconds after a previous kill, a consecutive kill occurs. The timer starts ticking anew, allowing a third kill, a fourth kill etc. Alternatively, killing several enemies with a mega weapon (such as the Redeemer, which resembles a nuclear rocket) also counts as consecutive kill. The titles of these kills are: Double Kill (2), Multi kill (3), Ultra kill (4), Megakill (5), MONSTERKILL (6; 5 in the original Unreal Tournament). For comparison, id Software&#x27;s &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; tracks double kills, but a third kill soon after results in another double kill award.

=== &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; ===
This game&#x27;s approach to combat achievements tracking is different from &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;. In deathmatch, the player might be rewarded with awards for the following tricks:

* &quot;perfect!&quot; – winning a round of deathmatch without getting killed
* &quot;impressive!&quot; – hitting with two consecutive shots or hitting two enemies with one shot from the railgun (a powerful, long-range hitscan weapon with a slow rate of fire)
* &quot;humiliation!&quot; – killing an opponent with the melee razor-like gauntlet (the killed player hears the announcement too, but the fact of being humiliated is not tracked for him).
* &quot;accuracy&quot; – having over 50% of hits-to-shots ratio.

=== Last Man Standing ===
The Last Man Standing (LMS) version of deathmatch is fundamentally different from deathmatch. In deathmatch, it does not matter how many times the player dies, only how many times the player kills. In LMS, it is the exact opposite — the important task is &quot;not to die&quot;. Because of this, two activities that are not specifically addressed in deathmatch have to be controlled in LMS.

* &quot;Camping&quot;, which is a recognized expression for staying in one location (usually somewhat protected or with only one access route) and eventually using long range weapons, such as a sniper rifle, from that location. In standard deathmatch, campers usually accumulate fewer frags than players who actively search for enemies, because close range combat usually generates frags faster than sniping from afar. In LMS, however, camping increases the average lifespan. &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot; addresses this unfairness by indicating players who are camping and providing other players with navigation to campers.
* &quot;Staying dead&quot; – after dying, player representations lie on the ground (where applicable) and are shown the results of the game in progress. They have to perform some action, usually click the &quot;Fire&quot; key or button, to respawn and reenter combat. This principle prevents players who might have been forced by real world situations (be it a sudden cough or a door ring) to leave the computer from dying over and over. In standard deathmatch, a player who stays dead is not a problem, as the goal is to score the most frags, not die the least times. In LMS, however, a player that would be allowed to stay dead after being killed for the first time might wait through most of the fight and respawn when there&#x27;s only one opponent remaining. Because of this, &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot; automatically respawns a player immediately after being killed.

<text>Tiraspol (, ; , , , also ; ) is the capital and largest city of Transnistria, a breakaway state of Moldova, where it is the third-largest city. The city is located on the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Tiraspol is a regional hub of culture, economy, tourism, and light industry, such as furniture and electrical goods production.

The modern city of Tiraspol was founded by the Russian generalissimo Alexander Suvorov in 1792, although the area had been inhabited for thousands of years by varying ethnic groups. The city celebrates its anniversary every year on 14 October.

== Etymology ==
The toponym consists of two ancient Greek words: , &quot;Tyras&quot;, the Ancient name for the Dniester River, and &quot;polis&quot;, i.e., a city (state).

== History ==
=== Classical and medieval history ===
Tyras (), also spelled &quot;Tiras&quot;, was a colony of the Greek city Miletus, probably founded about 600 BC, situated some from the mouth of the Tiras River (Dniester). Of no great importance in early times, in the second century BC it fell under the dominion of indigenous kings whose names appear on its coins. It was destroyed by the Thracian Getae about 50 BC.

In 56 AD, the Romans restored the city and made it part of the colonial province of Lower Moesia. A series of its coins exist that feature heads of Roman emperors from Domitian to Severus Alexander. Soon after the time of the latter, the city was destroyed again, this time by the invasion of the Goths. Its government was in the hands of five archons, a senate, a popular assembly, and a registrar. The images on its coins from this period suggest a trade in wheat, wine, and fish. The few inscriptions extant are mostly concerned with trade.

Such ancient archeological remains are scanty, as the city site was built over by the great medieval fortress of Monocastro or Akkerman. In the Late Middle Ages, the area around of modern Tiraspol became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Lithuanians, unable to settle their vast state on their own, allowed Moldavian settlement in the area.

=== Tsarist Russian rule ===

The Russian Empire conquered its way to the Dniester River, taking territory from the Ottoman Empire. In 1792 the Russian army built fortifications to guard the western border near a Moldavian village named Sucleia. Field Marshal Alexander Suvorov is considered the founder of modern Tiraspol; his statue is the city&#x27;s most distinctive landmark. The city took its name from &quot;Tyras&quot;, the Greek name of the Dniester River on which it stands. It was granted city rights in 1795.

In 1828, the Russian government established a customs house in Tiraspol to try to suppress smuggling. The customs house was subordinated to the chief of the Odesa customs region. It began operations with 14 employees. They inspected shipments of bread, paper, oil, wine, sugar, fruits and other goods.
In December 1917, Tiraspol hosted a congress of Transnistrian Moldovans, at which they wished to unite the city with Bessarabia.

=== Soviet Tiraspol ===

After the Russian Revolution, the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created in Ukraine in 1924, with Balta as its capital. The republic had Romanian, Ukrainian and Russian as its official languages. Its capital was moved in 1929 to Tiraspol, which remained the capital of the Moldavian ASSR until 1940.

In 1940, following the secret provisions of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the USSR forced Romania to cede Bessarabia. It integrated Tiraspol, until then part of the Moldavian ASSR, into the newly formed Moldavian SSR. On 7 August 1941, following the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, the city was taken over by Romanian troops. Later that month, on 19 August, the Tiraspol Agreement establishing the Transnistria Governorate was signed. During the occupation, Tiraspol was under Romanian administration. During that period almost all of its Jewish population died: they were slain &quot;in situ&quot; or deported to German Nazi death camps, and killed there.
In 1941, before the occupation, the newspaper &quot;Dnestrovskaya Pravda&quot; was founded by the Tiraspol City Council of popular deputies. This is the oldest periodical publication in the region. On 12 April 1944, the city was retaken by the Red Army and became again part of the Moldavian SSR.

According to a 1991 figure by Moldova&#x27;s Ministry of National Security (now the Security and Intelligence Service, SIS), of the 5,485 people who were sentenced to death in the territory of modern Moldova during totalitarian communist rule, over 4,000 of them were executed in Tiraspol, in the , in 1937 and 1938 alone, during the Great Purge.

=== Post-secession ===
On 27 January 1990, the citizens in Tiraspol passed a referendum declaring the city as an independent territory. The nearby city of Bendery also declared its independence from Moldova. As the Russian-speaking independence movement gained momentum, some local governments banded together to resist pressure from the Moldovan government for nationalization.

On 2 September 1990, Tiraspol was proclaimed the capital of the new Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. The new republic was not officially recognized by Soviet authorities; however, it received support from some important Soviet leaders, such as Anatoly Lukyanov. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the territory east of the Dniester River declared independence as the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR), with Tiraspol as its capital. It was not recognized by the international community.
On 1 July 2005, the Lucian Blaga Lyceum, a high school with Romanian as its language of instruction, was registered as a Transnistrian non-governmental establishment. The registration of six Romanian language schools has been the subject of negotiations with the government since 2000. The tension increased in the summer of 2004, when the Transnistrian authorities forcibly closed the schools that taught using the Latin script. According to the official PMR view, this is considered as Romanian. &quot;Moldovan&quot;, written in the Cyrillic script, is one of the three official languages in the PMR; Romanian is not. Some economic measures and counter-measures were taken on both banks of the Dniester.

Tensions have been seen in terrorist incidents. On 6 July 2006, an explosion, believed to be caused by a bomb, killed at least eight people in a minibus. Later on 13 August, a grenade exploded in a trolleybus, killing two and injuring ten.

On 25 April 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, several explosions were reported near the Ministry of State Security (Transnistria) in Tiraspol. Firefighters were on the scene but there were no casualties.

On 17 March 2024, Transnistrian official press released a video allegedly showing a Mil Mi-8 helicopter in poor condition and likely not in use, not having been moved in over 13 years at the moment of the explosion, in a military unit in Tiraspol being attacked and destroyed by a kamikaze drone. No victims were reported. Transnistria claimed the drone had been launched from Ukraine from the direction of Odesa, more precisely from a bridge located from the nearest border crossing between Transnistria and Ukraine. Ukraine immediately denied having anything to do with the incident. On the day of the incident, the Bureau for Reintegration of the Republic of Moldova called it an &quot;attempt to provoke panic and fear in the region&quot;. Later, on 25 March, the bureau confirmed the explosion of the helicopter was not caused by a drone attack but by &quot;other factors&quot; and that the video contained &quot;obvious elements of video montage&quot;. In the video, the drone disappears shortly before the explosion below the helicopter occurs. Reportedly, explosives placed under the helicopter were detonated remotely instead.

On 8 January 2025, during the 2025 Moldovan energy crisis, a woman in Tiraspol died from carbon monoxide poisoning after using a gas water heater to shower without having a chimney.

==Geography and climate==
Tiraspol features a humid continental climate that closely borders an oceanic climate and has transitional features of the humid subtropical climate due to its warm summers. Summers are mild, with average monthly temperatures at around in July and August. Winters are cold, with average temperatures in the coldest month (January) at . Precipitation is relatively evenly spread throughout the year, though there is a noticeable increase in monthly precipitation in June and July. Tiraspol on average sees nearly of precipitation per year.
== Demographics ==
=== Population ===

The population of the city was about 190,000 in 1989 and about 203,000 in 1992. 41% were Russians, 32% Ukrainians (both Eastern Slavic) and 18% were Moldovans (Romanians).

As result of the political and economic situation that followed the proclamation of the independent (unrecognized) Transnistria, as well as large Jewish emigration in the early 1990s, the population of the city fell below its 1989 number and the 2004 Transnistrian census put its population at 158,069.
In 1897, 31,616 people lived in the city of Tiraspol, who were classified, by language, in the following way:

In 1926, 29,700 people lived in the city of Tiraspol who were classified, by ethnicity, as follows:

=== Religion ===
The Latin Catholic minority is served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chișinău.

In the fourteenth century, Tiraspol was the see city of the diocese of Kherson; in 1848, a Roman Catholic Diocese of Tiraspol was erected with its see in Saratov. Since 1993, it did not cover any Moldovan territory, not even Tiraspol. The diocese was suppressed in 2002.

== Culture ==
The statue of Alexander Suvorov was erected in the central square in 1979 in commemoration of his 250th anniversary. In front of the Transnistrian Government building there is a statue of Vladimir Lenin. On the opposite side of the central square, a monument plaza features a Soviet T-34 tank, commemorating the Soviet victory in World War II, an eternal flame to those who fell defending the city in 1941 and liberating it in 1944, as well as several monuments dedicated to more recent conflicts, including the Soviet–Afghan War and the War of Transnistria.

==Sport==

The two main football clubs are Sheriff Tiraspol and FC Tiraspol. Sheriff is the most successful Moldovan football club of recent history, winning 14 league titles since the 2000–2001 season, and 6 Moldovan Cups. The team gained world notoriety for their last-minute 2–1 victory during the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League edition against later tournament winners Real Madrid on 28 September 2021. A third club, CS Tiligul-Tiras Tiraspol, withdrew from competition prior to the 2009–2010 season. Tiraspol is home to the Sheriff Stadium, the largest capacity stadium in the region, with a capacity of 14,300 seats.

<text>A Lutheran chorale is a musical setting of a Lutheran hymn, intended to be sung by a congregation in a German Protestant church service. The typical four-part setting of a chorale, in which the sopranos (and the congregation) sing the melody along with three lower voices, is known as a &quot;chorale harmonization&quot;. The practice of singing in unison was the rule of the reformed churches, both in Germany and in other countries.

==Lutheran hymns==

Starting in 1523, Martin Luther began translating worship texts into German from the Latin. He composed melodies for some hymns himself, such as &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot; (&quot;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God&quot;), and even a few harmonized settings. For other hymns he adapted Gregorian chant melodies used in Catholic worship to fit new German texts, sometimes using the same melody more than once. For example, he fitted the melody of the hymn &quot;Veni redemptor gentium&quot; to three different texts, &quot;Verleih uns Frieden gnädiglich&quot;, &quot;Erhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort&quot;, and &quot;Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland&quot;. The first Lutheran hymns were published in 1524. These included the &#x27; (known as the first Lutheran hymnal) and the &quot;Erfurt Enchiridion&quot; (both with unaccompanied melodic settings), as well as Johann Walter&#x27;s &#x27;, the first to contain part song settings of Lutheran hymns.

Luther and his contemporaries referred to these vernacular hymns as &quot;geistliche Lieder&quot; (spiritual songs), &quot;Psalmen&quot; (psalms), &quot;christliche Lieder&quot; (Christian songs), and &quot;geistliche&quot; (or &quot;christliche&quot;) &quot;Gesänge&quot; or &quot;Kirchengesänge&quot;. The German word &quot;Choral&quot;, which was originally used to describe Latin plainchant melodies, was first applied to the Lutheran hymn only in the later sixteenth century.

In the modern era, many Lutheran hymns are used in Protestant worship, sometimes sung in four-part harmony. A four-part harmony is the traditional method of organizing chords for 4 different voice ranges: soprano, alto, tenor and bass (known together as &#x27;SATB&#x27;). The term &#x27;voice&#x27; or &#x27;part&#x27; refers to any musical line whether it is a melody sung by singers, a long note played on a instrument or anything in between.

* Bartholomäus Gesius (–1613)
* Michael Praetorius (1571–1621)
* Melchior Franck (–1639)
* Melchior Teschner (1584–1635)

In his &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, he set five stanzas of &quot;O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden&quot; in four different ways. He also used hymns as the base for his cycle of chorale cantatas and chorale preludes. Bach concentrated on the chorales especially in the Chorale cantatas of his second annual cycle, composed mostly in 1724/25.

* George C. Baker (b. 1951)

==Compositions based on Lutheran chorales==


===Vocal===
===Organ===

Chorales also appear in chorale preludes, pieces generally for organ originally designed to be played immediately before the congregational singing of the hymn, but developed into an autonomous genre by north-German composers of the middle and late 17th century, particularly Dieterich Buxtehude. A chorale prelude includes the melody of the chorale, and adds contrapuntal lines. One of the first composers to write chorale preludes was Samuel Scheidt. Bach&#x27;s many chorale preludes are the best-known examples of the form. Later composers of the chorale prelude include Johannes Brahms, for example in his Eleven Chorale Preludes, and Max Reger who composed many examples, including &quot;Wie schön leucht&#x27; uns der Morgenstern&quot; (based on the hymn by Philipp Nicolai). In the 20th century, important contributions to the genre were made by Hugo Distler and Ernst Pepping.

===Other instrumental===
*Sofia Gubaidulina – &quot;Meditation über den Bach-Choral &quot;Vor deinen Thron tret&#x27; ich hiermit&quot;&quot;, for harpsichord, two violins, viola, cello, and contrabass (1993)

==Scholarship==
Scholarship regarding Lutheran chorales intensified from the 19th century. 

===Carl von Winterfeld===
The musicologist Carl von Winterfeld published three volumes of &quot;Der evangelische Kirchengesang und sein Verhältniss zur Kunst des Tonsatzes&quot; (Evangelical church-song and its relation to the art of composition) from 1843 to 1847.

===Zahn&#x27;s classification of chorale tunes===
Johannes Zahn published &quot;Die Melodien der deutschen evangelischen Kirchenlieder&quot; (the tunes of the German Evangelical hymns) in six volumes from 1889 to 1893.

<doc id="99491" wikidata="Q33456" url="?curid=99491" title="Exponentiation">
<text>In mathematics, exponentiation, denoted , is an operation involving two numbers: the &quot;base&quot;, , and the &quot;exponent&quot; or &quot;power&quot;, . When is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, is the product of multiplying bases:
formula_1In particular, formula_2.

The exponent is usually shown as a superscript to the right of the base as or in computer code as codice_1. This binary operation is often read as &quot; to the power &quot;; it may also be referred to as &quot; raised to the th power&quot;, &quot;the th power of &quot;, or, most briefly, &quot; to the &quot;.

The above definition of formula_3 immediately implies several properties, in particular the multiplication rule:

formula_4

That is, when multiplying a base raised to one power times the same base raised to another power, the powers add. Extending this rule to the power zero gives formula_5, and dividing both sides by formula_3 gives formula_7. That is, the multiplication rule implies the definition formula_8A similar argument implies the definition for negative integer powers: formula_9That is, extending the multiplication rule gives formula_10. Dividing both sides by formula_3 gives formula_12. This also implies the definition for fractional powers: formula_13For example, formula_14, meaning formula_15, which is the definition of square root: formula_16.

The definition of exponentiation can be extended in a natural way (preserving the multiplication rule) to define formula_17 for any positive real base formula_18 and any real number exponent formula_19. More involved definitions allow complex base and exponent, as well as certain types of matrices as base or exponent.

Exponentiation is used extensively in many fields, including economics, biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science, with applications such as compound interest, population growth, chemical reaction kinetics, wave behavior, and public-key cryptography.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;exponent&quot; originates from the Latin &quot;exponentem&quot;, the present participle of &quot;exponere&quot;, meaning &quot;to put forth&quot;. The term &quot;power&quot; () is a mistranslation of the ancient Greek δύναμις (&quot;dúnamis&quot;, here: &quot;amplification&quot;) used by the Greek mathematician Euclid for the square of a line, following Hippocrates of Chios.

==History==

===Antiquity===

====The Sand Reckoner====

In &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot;, Archimedes proved the law of exponents, , necessary to manipulate powers of . He then used powers of to estimate the number of grains of sand that can be contained in the universe.

===Islamic Golden Age===

====&quot;Māl&quot; and &quot;kaʿbah&quot; (&quot;square&quot; and &quot;cube&quot;)====
In the 9th century, the Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi used the terms مَال (&quot;māl&quot;, &quot;possessions&quot;, &quot;property&quot;) for a square—the Muslims, &quot;like most mathematicians of those and earlier times, thought of a squared number as a depiction of an area, especially of land, hence property&quot;—and كَعْبَة (&quot;Kaʿbah&quot;, &quot;cube&quot;) for a cube, which later Islamic mathematicians represented in mathematical notation as the letters &quot;mīm&quot; (m) and &quot;kāf&quot; (k), respectively, by the 15th century, as seen in the work of Abu&#x27;l-Hasan ibn Ali al-Qalasadi.

===15th–18th century===

====Introducing exponents====
Nicolas Chuquet used a form of exponential notation in the 15th century, for example to represent . This was later used by Henricus Grammateus and Michael Stifel in the 16th century. In the late 16th century, Jost Bürgi would use Roman numerals for exponents in a way similar to that of Chuquet, for example for .

====&quot;Exponent&quot;; &quot;square&quot; and &quot;cube&quot;====
The word &quot;exponent&quot; was coined in 1544 by Michael Stifel. In the 16th century, Robert Recorde used the terms &quot;square&quot;, &quot;cube&quot;, &quot;zenzizenzic&quot; (fourth power), &quot;sursolid&quot; (fifth), &quot;zenzicube&quot; (sixth), &quot;second sursolid&quot; (seventh), and &quot;zenzizenzizenzic&quot; (eighth). &quot;Biquadrate&quot; has been used to refer to the fourth power as well.

====Modern exponential notation====
In 1636, James Hume used in essence modern notation, when in &quot;L&#x27;algèbre de Viète&quot; he wrote for . Early in the 17th century, the first form of our modern exponential notation was introduced by René Descartes in his text titled &quot;La Géométrie&quot;; there, the notation is introduced in Book I.

Some mathematicians (such as Descartes) used exponents only for powers greater than two, preferring to represent squares as repeated multiplication. Thus they would write polynomials, for example, as .

====&quot;Indices&quot;====
Samuel Jeake introduced the term &quot;indices&quot; in 1696. The term &quot;involution&quot; was used synonymously with the term &quot;indices&quot;, but had declined in usage and should not be confused with its more common meaning.

====Variable exponents, non-integer exponents====

In 1748, Leonhard Euler introduced variable exponents, and, implicitly, non-integer exponents by writing:

===20th century===

As calculation was mechanized, notation was adapted to numerical capacity by conventions in exponential notation. For example Konrad Zuse introduced floating point arithmetic in his 1938 computer Z1. One register contained representation of leading digits, and a second contained representation of the exponent of 10. Earlier Leonardo Torres Quevedo contributed &quot;Essays on Automation&quot; (1914) which had suggested the floating-point representation of numbers. The more flexible decimal floating-point representation was introduced in 1946 with a Bell Laboratories computer. Eventually educators and engineers adopted scientific notation of numbers, consistent with common reference to order of magnitude in a ratio scale.

For instance, in 1961 the School Mathematics Study Group developed the notation in connection with units used in the metric system.

Exponents also came to be used to describe units of measurement and quantity dimensions. For instance, since force is mass times acceleration, it is measured in kg m/sec2. Using M for mass, L for length, and T for time, the expression M L T–2 is used in dimensional analysis to describe force.

==Terminology==
The expression is called &quot;the square of &quot; or &quot; squared&quot;, because the area of a square with side-length is . (It is true that it could also be called &quot; to the second power&quot;, but &quot;the square of &quot; and &quot; squared&quot; are more traditional)

Similarly, the expression is called &quot;the cube of &quot; or &quot; cubed&quot;, because the volume of a cube with side-length is .

When an exponent is a positive integer, that exponent indicates how many copies of the base are multiplied together. For example, . The base appears times in the multiplication, because the exponent is . Here, is the &quot;5th power of 3&quot;, or &quot;3 raised to the 5th power&quot;.

The word &quot;raised&quot; is usually omitted, and sometimes &quot;power&quot; as well, so can be simply read &quot;3 to the 5th&quot;, or &quot;3 to the 5&quot;.

== Integer exponents ==

The exponentiation operation with integer exponents may be defined directly from elementary arithmetic operations.

===Positive exponents===
The definition of the exponentiation as an iterated multiplication can be formalized by using induction, and this definition can be used as soon as one has an associative multiplication:

The base case is
: formula_20
and the recurrence is
: formula_21

The associativity of multiplication implies that for any positive integers and ,
: formula_22
and
: formula_23

===Zero exponent===
As mentioned earlier, a (nonzero) number raised to the power is :
: formula_24

This value is also obtained by the empty product convention, which may be used in every algebraic structure with a multiplication that has an identity. This way the formula
: formula_25
also holds for formula_26.

The case of is controversial. In contexts where only integer powers are considered, the value is generally assigned to but, otherwise, the choice of whether to assign it a value and what value to assign may depend on context. 

===Negative exponents===
Exponentiation with negative exponents is defined by the following identity, which holds for any integer and nonzero :
: formula_27.
Raising 0 to a negative exponent is undefined but, in some circumstances, it may be interpreted as infinity (formula_28).

This definition of exponentiation with negative exponents is the only one that allows extending the identity formula_25 to negative exponents (consider the case formula_30).

The same definition applies to invertible elements in a multiplicative monoid, that is, an algebraic structure, with an associative multiplication and a multiplicative identity denoted (for example, the square matrices of a given dimension). In particular, in such a structure, the inverse of an invertible element is standardly denoted formula_31

===Identities and properties===

The following identities, often called , hold for all integer exponents, provided that the base is non-zero:
: formula_32

Unlike addition and multiplication, exponentiation is not commutative: for example, formula_33, but reversing the operands gives the different value formula_34. Also unlike addition and multiplication, exponentiation is not associative: for example, , whereas . Without parentheses, the conventional order of operations for serial exponentiation in superscript notation is top-down (or &quot;right&quot;-associative), not bottom-up (or &quot;left&quot;-associative). That is,
: formula_35
which, in general, is different from
: formula_36

===Powers of a sum===
The powers of a sum can normally be computed from the powers of the summands by the binomial formula
: formula_37

However, this formula is true only if the summands commute (i.e. that ), which is implied if they belong to a structure that is commutative. Otherwise, if and are, say, square matrices of the same size, this formula cannot be used. It follows that in computer algebra, many algorithms involving integer exponents must be changed when the exponentiation bases do not commute. Some general purpose computer algebra systems use a different notation (sometimes instead of ) for exponentiation with non-commuting bases, which is then called non-commutative exponentiation.

===Combinatorial interpretation===
For nonnegative integers and , the value of is the number of functions from a set of elements to a set of elements (see cardinal exponentiation). Such functions can be represented as -tuples from an -element set (or as -letter words from an -letter alphabet). Some examples for particular values of and are given in the following table:

===Particular bases===

====Powers of ten ====
In the base ten (decimal) number system, integer powers of are written as the digit followed or preceded by a number of zeroes determined by the sign and magnitude of the exponent. For example, and .

Exponentiation with base is used in scientific notation to denote large or small numbers. For instance, (the speed of light in vacuum, in metres per second) can be written as and then approximated as .

SI prefixes based on powers of are also used to describe small or large quantities. For example, the prefix kilo means , so a kilometre is .

====Powers of two====

The first negative powers of have special names: formula_38is a &quot;half&quot;; formula_39 is a &quot;quarter.&quot;

Powers of appear in set theory, since a set with members has a power set, the set of all of its subsets, which has members.

Integer powers of are important in computer science. The positive integer powers give the number of possible values for an -bit integer binary number; for example, a byte may take different values. The binary number system expresses any number as a sum of powers of , and denotes it as a sequence of and , separated by a binary point, where indicates a power of that appears in the sum; the exponent is determined by the place of this : the nonnegative exponents are the rank of the on the left of the point (starting from ), and the negative exponents are determined by the rank on the right of the point.

====Powers of one====
Every power of one equals: .

====Powers of zero====
For a positive exponent , the th power of zero is zero: . For a negative\ exponent, formula_40 is undefined.

The expression  is either defined as formula_41, or it is left undefined.

====Powers of negative one====
Since a negative number times another negative is positive, we have:formula_42Because of this, powers of are useful for expressing alternating sequences. For a similar discussion of powers of the complex number , see &quot;.

===Large exponents===
The limit of a sequence of powers of a number greater than one diverges; in other words, the sequence grows without bound:
: as when 

This can be read as &quot;b&quot; to the power of &quot;n&quot; tends to +∞ as &quot;n&quot; tends to infinity when &quot;b&quot; is greater than one&quot;.

Powers of a number with absolute value less than one tend to zero:
: as when 

Any power of one is always one:
: for all for 

Powers of a negative number formula_43 alternate between positive and negative as alternates between even and odd, and thus do not tend to any limit as grows.

If the exponentiated number varies while tending to as the exponent tends to infinity, then the limit is not necessarily one of those above. A particularly important case is
: as 

See &quot; below.

Other limits, in particular those of expressions that take on an indeterminate form, are described in &quot; below.

===Power functions===

Real functions of the form formula_44, where formula_45, are sometimes called power functions. When formula_46 is an integer and formula_47, two primary families exist: for formula_46 even, and for formula_46 odd. In general for formula_50, when formula_46 is even formula_44 will tend towards positive infinity with increasing formula_19, and also towards positive infinity with decreasing formula_19. All graphs from the family of even power functions have the general shape of formula_55, flattening more in the middle as formula_46 increases. Functions with this kind of symmetry are called even functions.

When formula_46 is odd, formula_58&#x27;s asymptotic behavior reverses from positive formula_19 to negative formula_19. For formula_50, formula_44 will also tend towards positive infinity with increasing formula_19, but towards negative infinity with decreasing formula_19. All graphs from the family of odd power functions have the general shape of formula_65, flattening more in the middle as formula_46 increases and losing all flatness there in the straight line for formula_67. Functions with this kind of symmetry are called odd functions.

For formula_68, the opposite asymptotic behavior is true in each case.

===Table of powers of decimal digits===
==Rational exponents==
If is a nonnegative real number, and is a positive integer, formula_69 or formula_70 denotes the unique nonnegative real th root of , that is, the unique nonnegative real number such that formula_71

If is a positive real number, and formula_72 is a rational number, with and integers, then formula_73 is defined as
:formula_74
The equality on the right may be derived by setting formula_75 and writing formula_76

If is a positive rational number, , by definition.

All these definitions are required for extending the identity formula_77 to rational exponents.

On the other hand, there are problems with the extension of these definitions to bases that are not positive real numbers. For example, a negative real number has a real th root, which is negative, if is odd, and no real root if is even. In the latter case, whichever complex th root one chooses for formula_78 the identity formula_79 cannot be satisfied. For example,
:formula_80

See &#x27; and &#x27; for details on the way these problems may be handled.

==Real exponents==
For positive real numbers, exponentiation to real powers can be defined in two equivalent ways, either by extending the rational powers to reals by continuity (&#x27;, below), or in terms of the logarithm of the base and the exponential function (&#x27;, below). The result is always a positive real number, and the identities and properties shown above for integer exponents remain true with these definitions for real exponents. The second definition is more commonly used, since it generalizes straightforwardly to complex exponents.

On the other hand, exponentiation to a real power of a negative real number is much more difficult to define consistently, as it may be non-real and have several values. One may choose one of these values, called the principal value, but there is no choice of the principal value for which the identity
: formula_81
is true; see &quot;&quot;. Therefore, exponentiation with a basis that is not a positive real number is generally viewed as a multivalued function.

===Limits of rational exponents===

Since any irrational number can be expressed as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers, exponentiation of a positive real number with an arbitrary real exponent can be defined by continuity with the rule
:formula_82
where the limit is taken over rational values of only. This limit exists for every positive and every real .

For example, if , the non-terminating decimal representation and the monotonicity of the rational powers can be used to obtain intervals bounded by rational powers that are as small as desired, and must contain formula_83
:formula_84
So, the upper bounds and the lower bounds of the intervals form two sequences that have the same limit, denoted formula_85

This defines formula_17 for every positive and real as a continuous function of and . See also &quot;Well-defined expression&quot;.

===Exponential function===

The &quot;exponential function&quot; may be defined as formula_87 where formula_88 is Euler&#x27;s number, but to avoid circular reasoning, this definition cannot be used here. Rather, we give an independent definition of the exponential function formula_89 and of formula_90, relying only on positive integer powers (repeated multiplication). Then we sketch the proof that this agrees with the previous definition: formula_91

There are many equivalent ways to define the exponential function, one of them being
: formula_92

One has formula_93 and the &quot;exponential identity&quot; (or multiplication rule) formula_94 holds as well, since
: formula_95
and the second-order term formula_96 does not affect the limit, yielding formula_97.

Euler&#x27;s number can be defined as formula_90. It follows from the preceding equations that formula_99 when is an integer (this results from the repeated-multiplication definition of the exponentiation). If is real, formula_99 results from the definitions given in preceding sections, by using the exponential identity if is rational, and the continuity of the exponential function otherwise.

The limit that defines the exponential function converges for every complex value of , and therefore it can be used to extend the definition of formula_101, and thus formula_102 from the real numbers to any complex argument . This extended exponential function still satisfies the exponential identity, and is commonly used for defining exponentiation for complex base and exponent.

===Powers via logarithms===
The definition of as the exponential function allows defining for every positive real numbers , in terms of exponential and logarithm function. Specifically, the fact that the natural logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function means that one has
: formula_103
for every . For preserving the identity formula_104 one must have
: formula_105

So, formula_106 can be used as an alternative definition of for any positive real . This agrees with the definition given above using rational exponents and continuity, with the advantage to extend straightforwardly to any complex exponent.

==Complex exponents with a positive real base==
If is a positive real number, exponentiation with base and complex exponent is defined by means of the exponential function with complex argument (see the end of &quot;, above) as
: formula_107
where formula_108 denotes the natural logarithm of .

This satisfies the identity
: formula_109
In general,
formula_110 is not defined, since is not a real number. If a meaning is given to the exponentiation of a complex number (see &quot;, below), one has, in general,
: formula_111
unless is real or is an integer.

Euler&#x27;s formula,
: formula_112
allows expressing the polar form of formula_113 in terms of the real and imaginary parts of , namely
: formula_114
where the absolute value of the trigonometric factor is one. This results from
: formula_115

==Non-integer exponents with a complex base==
In the preceding sections, exponentiation with non-integer exponents has been defined for positive real bases only. For other bases, difficulties appear already with the apparently simple case of th roots, that is, of exponents formula_116 where is a positive integer. Although the general theory of exponentiation with non-integer exponents applies to th roots, this case deserves to be considered first, since it does not need to use complex logarithms, and is therefore easier to understand.

===th roots of a complex number===
Every nonzero complex number may be written in polar form as
:formula_117
where formula_118 is the absolute value of , and formula_119 is its argument. The argument is defined up to an integer multiple of ; this means that, if formula_119 is the argument of a complex number, then formula_121 is also an argument of the same complex number for every integer formula_122.

The polar form of the product of two complex numbers is obtained by multiplying the absolute values and adding the arguments. It follows that the polar form of an th root of a complex number can be obtained by taking the th root of the absolute value and dividing its argument by :
: formula_123

If formula_124 is added to formula_119, the complex number is not changed, but this adds formula_126 to the argument of the th root, and provides a new th root. This can be done times, and provides the th roots of the complex number.

It is usual to choose one of the th root as the principal root. The common choice is to choose the th root for which formula_127 that is, the th root that has the largest real part, and, if there are two, the one with positive imaginary part. This makes the principal th root a continuous function in the whole complex plane, except for negative real values of the radicand. This function equals the usual th root for positive real radicands. For negative real radicands, and odd exponents, the principal th root is not real, although the usual th root is real. Analytic continuation shows that the principal th root is the unique complex differentiable function that extends the usual th root to the complex plane without the nonpositive real numbers.

If the complex number is moved around zero by increasing its argument, after an increment of formula_128 the complex number comes back to its initial position, and its th roots are permuted circularly (they are multiplied by formula_129). This shows that it is not possible to define a th root function that is continuous in the whole complex plane.

====Roots of unity====

The th roots of unity are the complex numbers such that , where is a positive integer. They arise in various areas of mathematics, such as in discrete Fourier transform or algebraic solutions of algebraic equations (Lagrange resolvent).

The th roots of unity are the first powers of formula_130, that is formula_131 The th roots of unity that have this generating property are called &quot;primitive th roots of unity&quot;; they have the form formula_132 with coprime with . The unique primitive square root of unity is formula_133 the primitive fourth roots of unity are formula_134 and formula_135

The th roots of unity allow expressing all th roots of a complex number as the products of a given th roots of with a th root of unity.

Geometrically, the th roots of unity lie on the unit circle of the complex plane at the vertices of a regular -gon with one vertex on the real number 1.

As the number formula_136 is the primitive th root of unity with the smallest positive argument, it is called the &quot;principal primitive th root of unity&quot;, sometimes shortened as &quot;principal th root of unity&quot;, although this terminology can be confused with the principal value of formula_137, which is 1.

===Complex exponentiation===
Defining exponentiation with complex bases leads to difficulties that are similar to those described in the preceding section, except that there are, in general, infinitely many possible values for formula_138. So, either a principal value is defined, which is not continuous for the values of that are real and nonpositive, or formula_138 is defined as a multivalued function.

In all cases, the complex logarithm is used to define complex exponentiation as
: formula_140
where formula_141 is the variant of the complex logarithm that is used, which is a function or a multivalued function such that
: formula_142
for every in its domain of definition.

====Principal value====
The principal value of the complex logarithm is the unique continuous function, commonly denoted formula_143 such that, for every nonzero complex number ,
: formula_144
and the argument of satisfies
: formula_145
The principal value of the complex logarithm is not defined for formula_146 it is discontinuous at negative real values of , and it is holomorphic (that is, complex differentiable) elsewhere. If is real and positive, the principal value of the complex logarithm is the natural logarithm: formula_147

The principal value of formula_148 is defined as
formula_140
where formula_141 is the principal value of the logarithm.

The function formula_151 is holomorphic except in the neighbourhood of the points where is real and nonpositive.

If is real and positive, the principal value of formula_148 equals its usual value defined above. If formula_153 where is an integer, this principal value is the same as the one defined above.

====Multivalued function====
In some contexts, there is a problem with the discontinuity of the principal values of formula_141 and formula_148 at the negative real values of . In this case, it is useful to consider these functions as multivalued functions.

If formula_141 denotes one of the values of the multivalued logarithm (typically its principal value), the other values are formula_157 where is any integer. Similarly, if formula_148 is one value of the exponentiation, then the other values are given by
: formula_159
where is any integer.

Different values of give different values of formula_148 unless is a rational number, that is, there is an integer such that is an integer. This results from the periodicity of the exponential function, more specifically, that formula_161 if and only if formula_162 is an integer multiple of formula_163

If formula_164 is a rational number with and coprime integers with formula_165 then formula_148 has exactly values. In the case formula_167 these values are the same as those described in § th roots of a complex number. If is an integer, there is only one value that agrees with that of .

The multivalued exponentiation is holomorphic for formula_168 in the sense that its graph consists of several sheets that define each a holomorphic function in the neighborhood of every point. If varies continuously along a circle around , then, after a turn, the value of formula_148 has changed of sheet.

====Computation====
The &quot;canonical form&quot; formula_170 of formula_148 can be computed from the canonical form of and . Although this can be described by a single formula, it is clearer to split the computation in several steps.
* &quot;Polar form of &quot;. If formula_172 is the canonical form of ( and being real), then its polar form is formula_173 with formula_174 and formula_175, where is the two-argument arctangent function.
* &quot;Logarithm of &quot;. The principal value of this logarithm is formula_176 where formula_177 denotes the natural logarithm. The other values of the logarithm are obtained by adding formula_178 for any integer .
* &quot;Canonical form of formula_179&quot; If formula_180 with and real, the values of formula_181 are formula_182 the principal value corresponding to formula_183
* &quot;Final result&quot;. Using the identities formula_184 and formula_185 one gets formula_186 with formula_187 for the principal value.

=====Examples=====
* formula_188 &lt;br&gt;The polar form of is formula_189 and the values of formula_190 are thus formula_191 It follows that formula_192So, all values of formula_188 are real, the principal one being formula_194
* formula_195&lt;br&gt;Similarly, the polar form of is formula_196 So, the above described method gives the values formula_197In this case, all the values have the same argument formula_198 and different absolute values.

In both examples, all values of formula_148 have the same argument. More generally, this is true if and only if the real part of is an integer.

====Failure of power and logarithm identities====
Some identities for powers and logarithms for positive real numbers will fail for complex numbers, no matter how complex powers and complex logarithms are defined &quot;as single-valued functions&quot;. For example:

{(-1)^\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{i} = -i&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, when is an integer, the identities are valid for all nonzero complex numbers.

If exponentiation is considered as a multivalued function then the possible values of are . The identity holds, but saying is incorrect.
| The identity holds for real numbers and , but assuming its truth for complex numbers leads to the following paradox, discovered in 1827 by Clausen:

For any integer , we have:
# formula_200
# formula_201 (taking the formula_202-th power of both sides)
# formula_203 (using formula_204 and expanding the exponent)
# formula_205 (using formula_206)
# formula_207 (dividing by )

but this is false when the integer is nonzero.

The error is the following: by definition, formula_208 is a notation for formula_209 a true function, and formula_210 is a notation for formula_211 which is a multi-valued function. Thus the notation is ambiguous when . Here, before expanding the exponent, the second line should be
formula_212

Therefore, when expanding the exponent, one has implicitly supposed that formula_213 for complex values of , which is wrong, as the complex logarithm is multivalued. In other words, the wrong identity must be replaced by the identity
formula_214
which is a true identity between multivalued functions.

==Irrationality and transcendence==

If is a positive real algebraic number, and is a rational number, then is an algebraic number. This results from the theory of algebraic extensions. This remains true if is any algebraic number, in which case, all values of (as a multivalued function) are algebraic. If is irrational (that is, &quot;not rational&quot;), and both and are algebraic, Gelfond–Schneider theorem asserts that all values of are transcendental (that is, not algebraic), except if equals or .

In other words, if is irrational and formula_215 then at least one of , and is transcendental.

==Integer powers in algebra==
The definition of exponentiation with positive integer exponents as repeated multiplication may apply to any associative operation denoted as a multiplication. The definition of requires further the existence of a multiplicative identity.

An algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an associative operation denoted multiplicatively, and a multiplicative identity denoted by is a monoid. In such a monoid, exponentiation of an element is defined inductively by
* formula_216
* formula_217 for every nonnegative integer .

If is a negative integer, formula_218 is defined only if has a multiplicative inverse. In this case, the inverse of is denoted , and is defined as formula_219

Exponentiation with integer exponents obeys the following laws, for and in the algebraic structure, and and integers:
: formula_220

These definitions are widely used in many areas of mathematics, notably for groups, rings, fields, square matrices (which form a ring). They apply also to functions from a set to itself, which form a monoid under function composition. This includes, as specific instances, geometric transformations, and endomorphisms of any mathematical structure.

When there are several operations that may be repeated, it is common to indicate the repeated operation by placing its symbol in the superscript, before the exponent. For example, if is a real function whose valued can be multiplied, formula_221 denotes the exponentiation with respect of multiplication, and formula_222 may denote exponentiation with respect of function composition. That is,
: formula_223
and
: formula_224
Commonly, formula_225 is denoted formula_226 while formula_227 is denoted formula_228

===In a group===
A multiplicative group is a set with as associative operation denoted as multiplication, that has an identity element, and such that every element has an inverse.

So, if is a group, formula_218 is defined for every formula_230 and every integer .

The set of all powers of an element of a group form a subgroup. A group (or subgroup) that consists of all powers of a specific element is the cyclic group generated by . If all the powers of are distinct, the group is isomorphic to the additive group formula_231 of the integers. Otherwise, the cyclic group is finite (it has a finite number of elements), and its number of elements is the order of . If the order of is , then formula_232 and the cyclic group generated by consists of the first powers of (starting indifferently from the exponent or ).

Order of elements play a fundamental role in group theory. For example, the order of an element in a finite group is always a divisor of the number of elements of the group (the &quot;order&quot; of the group). The possible orders of group elements are important in the study of the structure of a group (see Sylow theorems), and in the classification of finite simple groups.

Superscript notation is also used for conjugation; that is, , where and are elements of a group. This notation cannot be confused with exponentiation, since the superscript is not an integer. The motivation of this notation is that conjugation obeys some of the laws of exponentiation, namely formula_233 and formula_234

===In a ring===
In a ring, it may occur that some nonzero elements satisfy formula_235 for some integer . Such an element is said to be nilpotent. In a commutative ring, the nilpotent elements form an ideal, called the nilradical of the ring.

If the nilradical is reduced to the zero ideal (that is, if formula_236 implies formula_237 for every positive integer ), the commutative ring is said to be reduced. Reduced rings are important in algebraic geometry, since the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic set is always a reduced ring.

More generally, given an ideal in a commutative ring , the set of the elements of that have a power in is an ideal, called the radical of . The nilradical is the radical of the zero ideal. A radical ideal is an ideal that equals its own radical. In a polynomial ring formula_238 over a field , an ideal is radical if and only if it is the set of all polynomials that are zero on an affine algebraic set (this is a consequence of Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz).

===Matrices and linear operators===
If is a square matrix, then the product of with itself times is called the matrix power. Also formula_239 is defined to be the identity matrix, and if is invertible, then formula_240.

Matrix powers appear often in the context of discrete dynamical systems, where the matrix expresses a transition from a state vector of some system to the next state of the system. This is the standard interpretation of a Markov chain, for example. Then formula_241 is the state of the system after two time steps, and so forth: formula_242 is the state of the system after time steps. The matrix power formula_243 is the transition matrix between the state now and the state at a time steps in the future. So computing matrix powers is equivalent to solving the evolution of the dynamical system. In many cases, matrix powers can be expediently computed by using eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Apart from matrices, more general linear operators can also be exponentiated. An example is the derivative operator of calculus, formula_244, which is a linear operator acting on functions formula_58 to give a new function formula_246. The th power of the differentiation operator is the th derivative:
: formula_247

These examples are for discrete exponents of linear operators, but in many circumstances it is also desirable to define powers of such operators with continuous exponents. This is the starting point of the mathematical theory of semigroups. Just as computing matrix powers with discrete exponents solves discrete dynamical systems, so does computing matrix powers with continuous exponents solve systems with continuous dynamics. Examples include approaches to solving the heat equation, Schrödinger equation, wave equation, and other partial differential equations including a time evolution. The special case of exponentiating the derivative operator to a non-integer power is called the fractional derivative which, together with the fractional integral, is one of the basic operations of the fractional calculus.

===Finite fields===

A field is an algebraic structure in which multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division are defined and satisfy the properties that multiplication is associative and every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. This implies that exponentiation with integer exponents is well-defined, except for nonpositive powers of . Common examples are the field of complex numbers, the real numbers and the rational numbers, considered earlier in this article, which are all infinite.

A &quot;finite field&quot; is a field with a finite number of elements. This number of elements is either a prime number or a prime power; that is, it has the form formula_248 where is a prime number, and is a positive integer. For every such , there are fields with elements. The fields with elements are all isomorphic, which allows, in general, working as if there were only one field with elements, denoted formula_249

One has
: formula_250
for every formula_251

A primitive element in formula_252 is an element such that the set of the first powers of (that is, formula_253) equals the set of the nonzero elements of formula_249 There are formula_255 primitive elements in formula_256 where formula_257 is Euler&#x27;s totient function.

In formula_256 the freshman&#x27;s dream identity
: formula_259
is true for the exponent . As formula_260 in formula_256 It follows that the map
: formula_262
is linear over formula_256 and is a field automorphism, called the Frobenius automorphism. If formula_248 the field formula_252 has automorphisms, which are the first powers (under composition) of . In other words, the Galois group of formula_252 is cyclic of order , generated by the Frobenius automorphism.

The Diffie–Hellman key exchange is an application of exponentiation in finite fields that is widely used for secure communications. It uses the fact that exponentiation is computationally inexpensive, whereas the inverse operation, the discrete logarithm, is computationally expensive. More precisely, if is a primitive element in formula_256 then formula_268 can be efficiently computed with exponentiation by squaring for any , even if is large, while there is no known computationally practical algorithm that allows retrieving from formula_268 if is sufficiently large.

==Powers of sets ==
The Cartesian product of two sets and is the set of the ordered pairs formula_270 such that formula_271 and formula_272 This operation is not properly commutative nor associative, but has these properties up to canonical isomorphisms, that allow identifying, for example, formula_273 formula_274 and formula_275

This allows defining the th power formula_276 of a set as the set of all -tuples formula_277 of elements of .

When is endowed with some structure, it is frequent that formula_276 is naturally endowed with a similar structure. In this case, the term &quot;direct product&quot; is generally used instead of &quot;Cartesian product&quot;, and exponentiation denotes product structure. For example formula_279 (where formula_280 denotes the real numbers) denotes the Cartesian product of copies of formula_281 as well as their direct product as vector space, topological spaces, rings, etc.

===Sets as exponents===

A -tuple formula_277 of elements of can be considered as a function from formula_283 This generalizes to the following notation.

Given two sets and , the set of all functions from to is denoted formula_284. This exponential notation is justified by the following canonical isomorphisms (for the first one, see Currying):
: formula_285
: formula_286
where formula_287 denotes the Cartesian product, and formula_288 the disjoint union.

One can use sets as exponents for other operations on sets, typically for direct sums of abelian groups, vector spaces, or modules. For distinguishing direct sums from direct products, the exponent of a direct sum is placed between parentheses. For example, formula_289 denotes the vector space of the infinite sequences of real numbers, and formula_290 the vector space of those sequences that have a finite number of nonzero elements. The latter has a basis consisting of the sequences with exactly one nonzero element that equals , while the Hamel bases of the former cannot be explicitly described (because their existence involves Zorn&#x27;s lemma).

In this context, can represents the set formula_291 So, formula_292 denotes the power set of , that is the set of the functions from to formula_293 which can be identified with the set of the subsets of , by mapping each function to the inverse image of .

This fits in with the exponentiation of cardinal numbers, in the sense that , where is the cardinality of .

===In category theory===

In the category of sets, the morphisms between sets and are the functions from to . It results that the set of the functions from to that is denoted formula_294 in the preceding section can also be denoted formula_295 The isomorphism formula_296 can be rewritten
:formula_297
This means the functor &quot;exponentiation to the power &quot; is a right adjoint to the functor &quot;direct product with &quot;.

This generalizes to the definition of exponentiation in a category in which finite direct products exist: in such a category, the functor formula_298 is, if it exists, a right adjoint to the functor formula_299 A category is called a &quot;Cartesian closed category&quot;, if direct products exist, and the functor formula_300 has a right adjoint for every .

==Repeated exponentiation==

Just as exponentiation of natural numbers is motivated by repeated multiplication, it is possible to define an operation based on repeated exponentiation; this operation is sometimes called hyper-4 or tetration. Iterating tetration leads to another operation, and so on, a concept named hyperoperation. This sequence of operations is expressed by the Ackermann function and Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation. Just as exponentiation grows faster than multiplication, which is faster-growing than addition, tetration is faster-growing than exponentiation. Evaluated at , the functions addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and tetration yield 6, 9, 27, and () respectively.

==Limits of powers==
Zero to the power of zero gives a number of examples of limits that are of the indeterminate form 00. The limits in these examples exist, but have different values, showing that the two-variable function has no limit at the point . One may consider at what points this function does have a limit.

More precisely, consider the function formula_301 defined on formula_302. Then can be viewed as a subset of (that is, the set of all pairs with , belonging to the extended real number line , endowed with the product topology), which will contain the points at which the function has a limit.

In fact, has a limit at all accumulation points of , except for , , and . Accordingly, this allows one to define the powers by continuity whenever , , except for , , and , which remain indeterminate forms.

Under this definition by continuity, we obtain:
* and , when .
* and , when .
* and , when .
* and , when .

These powers are obtained by taking limits of for &quot;positive&quot; values of . This method does not permit a definition of when , since pairs with are not accumulation points of .

On the other hand, when is an integer, the power is already meaningful for all values of , including negative ones. This may make the definition obtained above for negative problematic when is odd, since in this case as tends to through positive values, but not negative ones.

==Efficient computation with integer exponents==
Computing using iterated multiplication requires multiplication operations, but it can be computed more efficiently than that, as illustrated by the following example. To compute , apply Horner&#x27;s rule to the exponent 100 written in binary:
: formula_303.
Then compute the following terms in order, reading Horner&#x27;s rule from right to left.
This series of steps only requires 8 multiplications instead of 99.

In general, the number of multiplication operations required to compute can be reduced to formula_304 by using exponentiation by squaring, where formula_305 denotes the number of s in the binary representation of . For some exponents (100 is not among them), the number of multiplications can be further reduced by computing and using the minimal addition-chain exponentiation. Finding the &quot;minimal&quot; sequence of multiplications (the minimal-length addition chain for the exponent) for is a difficult problem, for which no efficient algorithms are currently known (see Subset sum problem), but many reasonably efficient heuristic algorithms are available. However, in practical computations, exponentiation by squaring is efficient enough, and much more easy to implement.

==Iterated functions==

Function composition is a binary operation that is defined on functions such that the codomain of the function written on the right is included in the domain of the function written on the left. It is denoted formula_306 and defined as
: formula_307
for every in the domain of .

If the domain of a function equals its codomain, one may compose the function with itself an arbitrary number of time, and this defines the th power of the function under composition, commonly called the &quot;th iterate&quot; of the function. Thus formula_221 denotes generally the th iterate of ; for example, formula_309 means formula_310

When a multiplication is defined on the codomain of the function, this defines a multiplication on functions, the pointwise multiplication, which induces another exponentiation. When using functional notation, the two kinds of exponentiation are generally distinguished by placing the exponent of the functional iteration &quot;before&quot; the parentheses enclosing the arguments of the function, and placing the exponent of pointwise multiplication &quot;after&quot; the parentheses. Thus formula_311 and formula_312 When functional notation is not used, disambiguation is often done by placing the composition symbol before the exponent; for example formula_313 and formula_314 For historical reasons, the exponent of a repeated multiplication is placed before the argument for some specific functions, typically the trigonometric functions. So, formula_315 and formula_316 both mean formula_317 and not formula_318 which, in any case, is rarely considered. Historically, several variants of these notations were used by different authors.

In this context, the exponent formula_319 denotes always the inverse function, if it exists. So formula_320 For the multiplicative inverse fractions are generally used as in formula_321

==In programming languages==
Programming languages generally express exponentiation either as an infix operator or as a function application, as they do not support superscripts. The most common operator symbol for exponentiation is the caret (codice_2). The original version of ASCII included an uparrow symbol (codice_3), intended for exponentiation, but this was replaced by the caret in 1967, so the caret became usual in programming languages.
The notations include:
* codice_4: AWK, BASIC, J, MATLAB, Wolfram Language (Mathematica), R, Microsoft Excel, Analytica, TeX (and its derivatives), TI-BASIC, bc (for integer exponents), Haskell (for nonnegative integer exponents), Lua, and most computer algebra systems.
* codice_5. The Fortran character set did not include lowercase characters or punctuation symbols other than codice_6 and so used codice_7 for exponentiation (the initial version used codice_8 instead.). Many other languages followed suit: Ada, Z shell, KornShell, Bash, COBOL, CoffeeScript, Fortran, FoxPro, Gnuplot, Groovy, JavaScript, OCaml, ooRexx, F#, Perl, PHP, PL/I, Python, Rexx, Ruby, SAS, Seed7, Tcl, ABAP, Mercury, Haskell (for floating-point exponents), Turing, and VHDL.
* codice_9: Algol Reference language, Commodore BASIC, TRS-80 Level II/III BASIC.
* codice_10: Haskell (for fractional base, integer exponents), D.
* codice_11: APL.

In most programming languages with an infix exponentiation operator, it is right-associative, that is, codice_12 is interpreted as codice_13. This is because codice_14 is equal to codice_15 and thus not as useful. In some languages, it is left-associative, notably in Algol, MATLAB, and the Microsoft Excel formula language.

Other programming languages use functional notation:
* codice_16: Common Lisp.
* codice_17: F# (for integer base, integer exponent).

Still others only provide exponentiation as part of standard libraries:
* codice_18: C, C++ (in codice_19 library).
* codice_20: C#.
* codice_21: Erlang.
* codice_22: Java.
* codice_23: PowerShell.
In some statically typed languages that prioritize type safety such as Rust, exponentiation is performed via a multitude of methods:

* codice_24 for codice_25 and codice_26 as integers
* codice_27 for codice_25 and codice_26 as floating point numbers
* codice_30 for codice_25 as a float and codice_26 as an integer

<text>The Lunar Orbiter program was a series of five uncrewed lunar orbiter missions launched by the United States in 1966 and 1967. Intended to help select Apollo landing sites by mapping the Moon&#x27;s surface, they provided the first photographs from lunar orbit and photographed both the Moon and Earth.

All five missions were successful, and 99 percent of the lunar surface was mapped from photographs taken with a resolution of or better. The first three missions were dedicated to imaging 20 potential crewed lunar landing sites, selected based on Earth-based observations. These were flown at low-inclination orbits. The fourth and fifth missions were devoted to broader scientific objectives and were flown in high-altitude polar orbits. Lunar Orbiter 4 photographed the entire nearside and nine percent of the far side, and Lunar Orbiter 5 completed the far side coverage and acquired medium () and high () resolution images of 36 preselected areas. All of the Lunar Orbiter spacecraft were launched by Atlas-Agena-D launch vehicles.

The Lunar Orbiters had an imaging system which consisted of a dual-lens camera, a film processing unit, a readout scanner, and a film handling apparatus. Both lenses, a narrow angle high resolution (HR) lens and an wide angle medium resolution (MR) lens, placed their frame exposures on a single roll of 70 mm film. The axes of the two cameras were coincident so the area imaged in the HR frames were centered within the MR frame areas. The film was moved during exposure to compensate for the spacecraft velocity, which was estimated by an electro-optical sensor. The film was then processed, scanned, and the images transmitted back to Earth.

During the Lunar Orbiter missions, the first pictures of Earth as a whole were taken, beginning with Earth-rise over the lunar surface by Lunar Orbiter 1 in August, 1966. The first full picture of the whole Earth was taken by Lunar Orbiter 5 on 8 August 1967. A second photo of the whole Earth was taken by Lunar Orbiter 5 on 10 November 1967.

==Spacecraft and subsystems==

The Boeing-Eastman Kodak proposal was announced by NASA on 20 December 1963. The main bus of the Lunar Orbiter had the general shape of a truncated cone, tall and in diameter at the base. The spacecraft was composed of three decks supported by trusses and an arch. The equipment deck at the base of the craft held the battery, transponder, flight programmer, inertial reference unit (IRU), Canopus star tracker, command decoder, multiplex encoder, traveling-wave tube amplifier (TWTA), and the photographic system. Four solar panels were mounted to extend out from this deck with a total span across of . Also extending out from the base of the spacecraft were a high gain antenna on a boom and a low-gain antenna on a boom. Above the equipment deck, the middle deck held the velocity control engine, propellant, oxidizer, and pressurization tanks, Sun sensors, and micrometeoroid detectors. The third deck consisted of a heat shield to protect the spacecraft from the firing of the velocity control engine. The nozzle of the engine protruded through the center of the shield. Mounted on the perimeter of the top deck were four attitude control thrusters.

Power of 375 W was provided by the four solar arrays containing 10,856 n/p solar cells which would directly run the spacecraft and also charge the 12 A·h nickel-cadmium battery. The batteries were used during the brief periods of occultation when no solar power was available. Propulsion for major maneuvers was provided by the gimballed velocity control engine, a hypergolic thrust Marquardt Corp. rocket motor. Three axis stabilization and attitude control were provided by four nitrogen gas jets. Navigational knowledge was provided by five Sun sensors, the Canopus star sensor, and the inertial navigation system. Communications were via a 10 W transmitter and the directional one-meter diameter high-gain antenna for transmission of photographs, and a 0.5 W transmitter and omnidirectional low-gain antenna for other communications. Both transmitters operated in the S band at about 2295 MHz. Thermal control was maintained by a multilayer aluminized Mylar and Dacron thermal blanket which enshrouded the main bus, special paint, insulation, and small heaters.

Originally, the Air Force had offered NASA several spare cameras from the KH-7 GAMBIT program, but then authorities became concerned over security surrounding the classified cameras, including the possibility of images of the Moon giving away their resolution. Some proposals were made that NASA not publish the orbital parameters of the Lunar Orbiter probes so that the resolution of the images could not be calculated through their altitude. In the end, NASA&#x27;s existing camera systems, while lower resolution, proved to be adequate for the needs of the mission.

=== Photographic subsystem ===

Kodak created and constructed built eight photographic subsystems for the Lunar Orbiter program, five of which were used in space missions of 1966 and 1967. The camera used two lenses to simultaneously expose a wide-angle and a high-resolution image on the same film. The wide-angle, medium resolution mode used an 80 mm F 2.8 Xenotar lens manufactured by Schneider Kreuznach of West Germany. The high-resolution mode used a 610 mm F 5.6 Panoramic lens manufactured by the Pacific Optical Company. The cameras exposed negatives on 65 mm Kodak Bimat film, which was then developed onboard using a semidry process. The subsystem&#x27;s photomultiplier then scanned the images by a for transmission to Earth as analog video. The receiving stations on Earth then transferred the video images back onto film, which was then shipped to Kodak in Rochester for final processing and printing. This system was adapted under permission of the NRO from the SAMOS E-1 reconnaissance camera, built by Kodak for a short-lived USAF near-realtime satellite imaging project.

=== Potential backup ===
As a backup for the Lunar Orbiter program, NASA and the NRO cooperated on the Lunar Mapping and Survey System (LM&amp;SS), based on the KH-7 reconnaissance satellite. Replacing the Lunar Module in the Saturn V, Apollo astronauts would operate LM&amp;SS remotely in lunar orbit. NASA canceled the project in the summer of 1967 after the complete success of the Lunar Orbiters.

==Results==
The Lunar Orbiter program consisted of five spacecraft which returned photography of 99 percent of the surface of the Moon (near and far side) with resolution down to . Altogether the Orbiters returned 2180 high resolution and 882 medium resolution frames. The micrometeoroid experiments recorded 22 impacts showing the average micrometeoroid flux near the Moon was about two orders of magnitude greater than in interplanetary space, but slightly less than in the near-Earth environment. The radiation experiments confirmed that the design of Apollo hardware would protect the astronauts from average and greater than average short term exposure to solar particle events.

The use of Lunar Orbiters for tracking to evaluate the Manned Space Flight Network tracking stations and Apollo Orbit Determination Program was successful, with three of the Lunar Orbiters (2, 3, and 5) being tracked simultaneously from August through October 1967. The Lunar Orbiters were all eventually commanded to crash on the Moon before their attitude control fuel ran out so they would not present navigational or communications hazards to later Apollo flights. The Lunar Orbiter program was managed by NASA Langley Research Center at a total cost of roughly $200 million.

Doppler tracking of the five orbiters allowed mapping of the gravitational field of the Moon and discovery of mass concentrations (mascons), or gravitational highs, which were located in the centers of some (but not all) of the lunar maria.

===Data availability===
The Lunar Orbiter orbital photographs were transmitted to Earth as analog data after onboard scanning of the original film into a series of strips. The data were written to magnetic tape and also to film. The film data were used to create hand-made mosaics of Lunar Orbiter frames. Each LO exposure resulted in two photographs: medium-resolution frames recorded by the 80-mm focal-length lens and high-resolution frames recorded by the 610-mm focal length lens. Due to their large size, HR frames were divided into three sections, or sub-frames. Large-format prints () from the mosaics were created and several copies were distributed across the U.S. to NASA image and data libraries known as Regional Planetary Information Facilities. The resulting outstanding views were of generally very high spatial resolution and covered a substantial portion of the lunar surface, but they suffered from a &quot;venetian blind&quot; striping, missing or duplicated data, and frequent saturation effects that hampered their use. For many years these images have been the basis of much of lunar scientific research. Because they were obtained at low to moderate Sun angles, the Lunar Orbiter photographic mosaics are particularly useful for studying the morphology of lunar topographic features.

Several atlases and books featuring Lunar Orbiter photographs have been published. Perhaps the most definitive was that of Bowker and Hughes (1971); it contained 675 photographic plates with approximately global coverage of the Moon. In part because of high interest in the data and in part because that atlas is out of print, the task was undertaken at the Lunar and Planetary Institute to scan the large-format prints of Lunar Orbiter data. These were made available online as the Digital Lunar Orbiter Photographic Atlas of the Moon.

===Data recovery and digitization===

In 2000, the Astrogeology Research Program of the US Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Arizona was funded by NASA (as part of the Lunar Orbiter Digitization Project ) to scan at 25 micrometer resolution archival LO positive film strips that were produced from the original data. The goal was to produce a global mosaic of the Moon using the best available Lunar Orbiter frames (largely the same coverage as that of Bowker and Hughes, 1971). The frames were constructed from scanned film strips; they were digitally constructed, geometrically controlled, and map-projected without the stripes that had been noticeable in the original photographic frames. Because of its emphasis on construction of a global mosaic, this project only scanned about 15% of the available Lunar Orbiter photographic frames. Data from Lunar Orbiter missions III, IV and V were included in the global mosaic.

In addition, the USGS digitization project created frames from very high resolution Lunar Orbiter images for several &#x27;sites of scientific interest.&#x27; These sites had been identified in the 1960s when the Apollo landing sites were being selected. Frames for sites such as the Apollo 12 landing site, the Marius Hills, and the Sulpicius Gallus rille have been released.

In 2007, the Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project (LOIRP) began a process to convert the Lunar Orbiter Images directly from the original Ampex FR-900 analog video recordings of the spacecraft data to digital image format, a change which provided vastly improved resolution over the original images released in the 1960s. The first of these restored images were released in late 2008. Almost all of the Lunar Orbiter images had been successfully recovered and were undergoing digital processing before being submitted to NASA&#x27;s Planetary Data System.

<doc id="99494" wikidata="Q915906" url="?curid=99494" title="Presentation of a group">
<text>In mathematics, a presentation is one method of specifying a group. A presentation of a group &quot;G&quot; comprises a [[generating set of a group|set &quot;S&quot; of generators]]—so that every element of the group can be written as a product of powers of some of these generators—and a set &quot;R&quot; of relations among those generators. We then say &quot;G&quot; has presentation

:formula_1

Informally, &quot;G&quot; has the above presentation if it is the &quot;freest group&quot; generated by &quot;S&quot; subject only to the relations &quot;R&quot;. Formally, the group &quot;G&quot; is said to have the above presentation if it is isomorphic to the quotient of a free group on &quot;S&quot; by the normal subgroup generated by the relations &quot;R&quot;.

As a simple example, the cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot; has the presentation

:formula_2

where 1 is the group identity. This may be written equivalently as

:formula_3

thanks to the convention that terms that do not include an equals sign are taken to be equal to the group identity. Such terms are called relators, distinguishing them from the relations that do include an equals sign.

Every group has a presentation, and in fact many different presentations; a presentation is often the most compact way of describing the structure of the group.

A closely related but different concept is that of an absolute presentation of a group.

== Background ==
A free group on a set &quot;S&quot; is a group where each element can be &quot;uniquely&quot; described as a finite length product of the form:

:formula_4

where the &quot;si&quot; are elements of S, adjacent &quot;si&quot; are distinct, and &quot;ai&quot; are non-zero integers (but &quot;n&quot; may be zero). In less formal terms, the group consists of words in the generators &quot;and their inverses&quot;, subject only to canceling a generator with an adjacent occurrence of its inverse.

If &quot;G&quot; is any group, and &quot;S&quot; is a generating subset of &quot;G&quot;, then every element of &quot;G&quot; is also of the above form; but in general, these products will not &quot;uniquely&quot; describe an element of &quot;G&quot;.

For example, the dihedral group D8 of order sixteen can be generated by a rotation, &quot;r&quot;, of order 8; and a flip, &quot;f&quot;, of order 2; and certainly any element of D8 is a product of &quot;r&quot;″s and &quot;f&quot;″s.

However, we have, for example, , , etc., so such products are &quot;not unique&quot; in D8. Each such product equivalence can be expressed as an equality to the identity, such as
:, or

Informally, we can consider these products on the left hand side as being elements of the free group , and let . That is, we let &quot;R&quot; be the subgroup generated by the strings &quot;rfrf&quot;, &quot;r&quot;8, &quot;f&quot;2, each of which is also equivalent to 1 when considered as products in D8.

If we then let &quot;N&quot; be the subgroup of &quot;F&quot; generated by all conjugates &quot;x&quot;−1&quot;Rx&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, then it follows by definition that every element of &quot;N&quot; is a finite product &quot;x&quot;1−1&quot;r&quot;1&quot;x&quot;1 ... &quot;xm&quot;−1&quot;rm&quot; &quot;xm&quot; of members of such conjugates. It follows that each element of &quot;N&quot;, when considered as a product in D8, will also evaluate to 1; and thus that &quot;N&quot; is a normal subgroup of &quot;F&quot;. Thus D8 is isomorphic to the quotient group . We then say that D8 has presentation

:formula_5

Here the set of generators is }, and the set of relations is . We often see &quot;R&quot; abbreviated, giving the presentation

:formula_6

An even shorter form drops the equality and identity signs, to list just the set of relators, which is . Doing this gives the presentation

:formula_7

All three presentations are equivalent.

== Notation ==

Although the notation used in this article for a presentation is now the most common, earlier writers used different variations on the same format. Such notations include the following:
*
*

== Definition ==

Let &quot;S&quot; be a set and let &quot;FS&quot; be the free group on &quot;S&quot;. Let &quot;R&quot; be a set of words on &quot;S&quot;, so &quot;R&quot; naturally gives a subset of formula_8. To form a group with presentation formula_9, take the quotient of formula_8 by the smallest normal subgroup that contains each element of &quot;R&quot;. (This subgroup is called the normal closure &quot;N&quot; of &quot;R&quot; in formula_8.) The group formula_9 is then defined as the quotient group
:formula_13
The elements of &quot;S&quot; are called the generators of formula_9 and the elements of &quot;R&quot; are called the relators. A group &quot;G&quot; is said to have the presentation formula_9 if &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to formula_9.

It is a common practice to write relators in the form formula_17 where &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are words on &quot;S&quot;. What this means is that formula_18. This has the intuitive meaning that the images of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are supposed to be equal in the quotient group. Thus, for example, &quot;rn&quot; in the list of relators is equivalent with formula_19.

For a finite group &quot;G&quot;, it is possible to build a presentation of &quot;G&quot; from the group multiplication table, as follows. Take &quot;S&quot; to be the set elements formula_20 of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;R&quot; to be all words of the form formula_21, where formula_22 is an entry in the multiplication table.

=== Alternate definition ===
The definition of group presentation may alternatively be recast in terms of equivalence classes of words on the alphabet formula_23. In this perspective, we declare two words to be equivalent if it is possible to get from one to the other by a sequence of moves, where each move consists of adding or removing a consecutive pair formula_24 or formula_25 for some in , or by adding or removing a consecutive copy of a relator. The group elements are the equivalence classes, and the group operation is concatenation.

This point of view is particularly common in the field of combinatorial group theory.

== Finitely presented groups ==
A presentation is said to be finitely generated if &quot;S&quot; is finite and finitely related if &quot;R&quot; is finite. If both are finite it is said to be a finite presentation. A group is finitely generated (respectively finitely related, ) if it has a presentation that is finitely generated (respectively finitely related, a finite presentation). A group which has a finite presentation with a single relation is called a one-relator group.

== Recursively presented groups ==
If &quot;S&quot; is indexed by a set &quot;I&quot; consisting of all the natural numbers N or a finite subset of them, then it is easy to set up a simple one to one coding (or Gödel numbering) from the free group on &quot;S&quot; to the natural numbers, such that we can find algorithms that, given &quot;f&quot;(&quot;w&quot;), calculate &quot;w&quot;, and vice versa. We can then call a subset &quot;U&quot; of &quot;FS&quot; recursive (respectively recursively enumerable) if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) is recursive (respectively recursively enumerable). If &quot;S&quot; is indexed as above and &quot;R&quot; recursively enumerable, then the presentation is a recursive presentation and the corresponding group is recursively presented. This usage may seem odd, but it is possible to prove that if a group has a presentation with &quot;R&quot; recursively enumerable then it has another one with &quot;R&quot; recursive.

Every finitely presented group is recursively presented, but there are recursively presented groups that cannot be finitely presented. However a theorem of Graham Higman states that a finitely generated group has a recursive presentation if and only if it can be embedded in a finitely presented group. From this we can deduce that there are (up to isomorphism) only countably many finitely generated recursively presented groups. Bernhard Neumann has shown that there are uncountably many non-isomorphic two generator groups. Therefore, there are finitely generated groups that cannot be recursively presented.

== History ==
One of the earliest presentations of a group by generators and relations was given by the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton in 1856, in his icosian calculus – a presentation of the icosahedral group.
The first systematic study was given by Walther von Dyck, student of Felix Klein, in the early 1880s, laying the foundations for combinatorial group theory.

== Examples ==
The following table lists some examples of presentations for commonly studied groups. Note that in each case there are many other presentations that are possible. The presentation listed is not necessarily the most efficient one possible.
An example of a finitely generated group that is not finitely presented is the wreath product formula_26 of the group of integers with itself.

== Some theorems ==
Theorem. Every group has a presentation.

To see this, given a group &quot;G&quot;, consider the free group &quot;FG&quot; on &quot;G&quot;. By the universal property of free groups, there exists a unique group homomorphism whose restriction to &quot;G&quot; is the identity map. Let &quot;K&quot; be the kernel of this homomorphism. Then &quot;K&quot; is normal in &quot;FG&quot;, therefore is equal to its normal closure, so . Since the identity map is surjective, &quot;φ&quot; is also surjective, so by the First Isomorphism Theorem, . This presentation may be highly inefficient if both &quot;G&quot; and &quot;K&quot; are much larger than necessary.

Corollary. Every finite group has a finite presentation.

One may take the elements of the group for generators and the Cayley table for relations.

===Novikov–Boone theorem===
The negative solution to the word problem for groups states that there is a finite presentation for which there is no algorithm which, given two words &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, decides whether &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; describe the same element in the group. This was shown by Pyotr Novikov in 1955 and a different proof was obtained by William Boone in 1958.

== Constructions ==
Suppose &quot;G&quot; has presentation and &quot;H&quot; has presentation with &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; being disjoint. Then
* the free product has presentation ;
* the direct product has presentation , where [&quot;S&quot;, &quot;T&quot;] means that every element from &quot;S&quot; commutes with every element from &quot;T&quot; (cf. commutator); and
* the semidirect product has presentation .

==Deficiency==
The deficiency of a finite presentation is just and the &quot;deficiency&quot; of a finitely presented group &quot;G&quot;, denoted def(&quot;G&quot;), is the maximum of the deficiency over all presentations of &quot;G&quot;. The deficiency of a finite group is non-positive. The Schur multiplicator of a finite group &quot;G&quot; can be generated by −def(&quot;G&quot;) generators, and &quot;G&quot; is efficient if this number is required.

== Geometric group theory ==


A presentation of a group determines a geometry, in the sense of geometric group theory: one has the Cayley graph, which has a metric, called the word metric. These are also two resulting orders, the &quot;weak order&quot; and the &quot;Bruhat order&quot;, and corresponding Hasse diagrams. An important example is in the Coxeter groups.

Further, some properties of this graph (the coarse geometry) are intrinsic, meaning independent of choice of generators.

<doc id="99495" wikidata="Q3444698" url="?curid=99495" title="Zulu traditional religion">
<text>Zulu traditional religion consists of the beliefs and spiritual practices of the Zulu people of southern Africa. It contains numerous deities commonly associated with animals or general classes of natural phenomena. Unkulunkulu is known to be the Supreme Creator.

== Beliefs ==

=== The Creator and the ancestors ===
Similar to other Bantu religions, adherents of Zulu traditional religion believe in honoring ancestors (Amadlozi) and in a multitude of gods. These beliefs are passed down orally through stories across generations. While the details of these stories may vary, they generally share the same themes, such as that the human world and the spirit world are interconnected, with divination practices used to bridge these realms. The roles and relationship of the sky god Umvelinqangi and Unkulunkulu, the highest god and creator of humanity, often change depending on the version of the story.

UmkhuluwoMkhulu (&quot;the greatest one&quot;) was created in Uhlanga, a huge swamp of reeds, before he came to Earth. Individuals base their morality or behavior ethics on his judgment or “apprehension of the Ultimate Reality.”

 Unkulunkulu is sometimes conflated with the sky god Umvelinqangi (meaning &quot;he who was in the very beginning&quot;), the god of thunder, earthquake whose other name is Unsondo, and is the son of Unkulunkulu, the Father, and Nomkhubulwane, the Mother.

The word &quot;nomkhubulwane&quot; means the one who shapeshifts into any form of an animal. Another name given for the supreme being Umkhuluwomkhulu is uSomandla, the ultimate source of all existence. European settlers used the word Unkulunkulu in order to try to explain their belief in the God of the bible to the people of Zululand.

According to Irvin Hexham (1981), &quot;there is no evidence of belief in a heavenly deity or sky god in Zulu religion before the advent of Europeans&quot;. However, other scholars such as Eileen Jensen Krige, Isaac Schapera, Axel-Ivar Berglund (1976), Hammond-Took, and John Mbiti disagree with Hexham&#x27;s analysis. They argue that the &quot;lord of heaven&quot; or Zulu sky god has always existed in the traditional Zulu belief system, a deity who they argue is greater than the &quot;archetypal ancestor and creator, Unkulunkulu&quot;.

=== Other deities ===

* Nomhoyi/Mamlambo, the goddess of rivers
* Nomkhubulwane, sometimes called the Zulu Demeter, who is a goddess of the rainbow, agriculture, rain and beer (which she invented)
* Inkosazana, another fertility goddess
* uNgungi, the deity of the blacksmiths
* iNyanga the Moon goddess is associated with healers who are called IziNyanga, the word &quot;nyanga&quot; is a Zulu word for the Moon
* Sonzwaphi the deity of healing
* Ukhulukhulwana (or UkhuluKhukwan) a star being ancestor who came from the stars and found the ancient Zulus living like animals and without laws. He taught them to build huts and taught them the high laws of isiNtu. The word &quot;unkulunkulu&quot; is suspected to be a corruption of the word &quot;umkhuluwomkhulu&quot;.
