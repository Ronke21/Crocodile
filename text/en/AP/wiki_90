<text>Hazel Green is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Madison County, Alabama, United States, and is included in the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the community was 4,105, up from 3,630 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

The origin of Hazel Green’s name is uncertain; however, a couple theories have been proposed, one being that the hazelnut bushes growing there were of a very vibrant green color in the springtime, and another is that the town was named for the wife of a store owner and postmaster in the early days of settlement in the area.

In the early 1800s, the area now known as Hazel Green became a convenient stopping point for travelers coming from Nashville to the north, Winchester to the east, nearby Huntsville to the south, and Athens to the west. These roads intersected at what is now the intersection of U.S. Route 231/431, Joe Quick Road, and West Limestone Road. By around 1810, farmers from Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas began rapidly relocating to Hazel Green after it was discovered the area had some of the richest soil in the Southeast. The town quickly developed into a bustling local trade center with the construction of gins, mills, grocers, and 2 inns. A post office and schoolhouse were both established for Hazel Green in 1819, and the town was incorporated as an act of the state legislature on June 15, 1821, with a population of 400. The economy was dependent on cotton and textile farming, and several families of notable wealth and influence lived in and worked out of Hazel Green.

By the mid 1800s, the growth of Hazel Green stagnated, large farms began breaking up, families moved elsewhere looking for work, and Hazel Green became unincorporated. The town would not show up on the U.S. Census again until 1980 as a census-designated place with a population of 1,503. While farming has remained an important backbone of Hazel Green’s economy throughout its history, job growth coming out of nearby Huntsville has brought with it new growth and development in recent years. Generational farmland has quickly been replaced with homes, multi-family complexes, fast-food restaurant chains, and various other retail chains. The topic of incorporation to accommodate this sudden explosion of growth has become a popular discussion amongst residents.

Hazel Green, along with other communities in the same area, has been prone to tornado activity in its history. On April 3, 1974, Hazel Green was hit by an F5 tornado during the 1974 Super Outbreak, causing several deaths. On March 2, 2012, Hazel Green was hit again by 2 tornados a part of the Tornado outbreak of March 2–3, 2012, resulting in the leveling of homes and businesses and roof damage to several buildings. On April 1, 2023, Hazel Green was hit by an EF3 tornado a part of the Tornado outbreak of March 31 – April 1, 2023, resulting in 1 death.

<text>New Hope is a city in Madison County, Alabama, United States, and is included in the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area. The population was 2,889 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Originally named &quot;Cloud&#x27;s Town&quot; in 1829 by its founder, William Cloud, it was incorporated in 1832 under the name of &quot;Vienna&quot;. Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Reed of the 12th Indiana Cavalry seized the town on May 29, 1864, during the American Civil War. Vienna was burned by the Union Army on December 15, 1864, because of the constant skirmishes with the guerrilla fighters in the area. All that remained were the post office and Masonic Lodge. Since there was already a post office called Vienna in southern Alabama and rules were that there could not be two post offices with the same name at that time, the rebuilt city was incorporated in 1883 as &quot;New Hope&quot;, taking its name from the New Hope Methodist Church. The settlement known as Cloud&#x27;s Town was actually settled in what is now known as Cloud&#x27;s Cove just off Hobbs Island Road, and is a few miles from the town of New Hope.

<text>Owens Cross Roads is a town in Madison County, Alabama, United States, and is included in the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area. It was incorporated on October 9, 1967. The population was 2,594 at the 2020 census. It is home to Brazelton Cemetery.

==History==
The area has a history that can be dated back to the early 1800’s. Pioneers had drifted into the area from Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia with names such as Wood, Parker, Craig, Craft, Maples, Carpenter and Brannum, but a gentleman named Thomas J. Owens had migrated from Virginia and was the first to build his family home near an intersection of two roads.

The name Owens Cross Roads was very appropriately chosen since the Owens home was at “the cross roads”. The community grew in size at a steady pace over the years as a large frame business house was erected near the intersection, containing a post office (established 1861), general store and blacksmith shop. Owens Cross Roads first appeared on maps in 1850.

Following the Civil War, the population grew as businesses sprang up and a new school was erected to replace the original log schoolhouse. With the turn of the 20th century came new growth to the neighboring towns of Huntsville and Guntersville, making Owens Cross Roads a welcome stop for travelers between the two larger towns. The town relied heavily on cotton cultivation throughout much of its early history, with some crop diversification coming in the 1920s and 1930s.

===Incorporation===

Incorporated in 1967, the Owens Cross Roads City Hall sits facing Highway 431 South, a busy corridor of modern life.

<text>Redstone Arsenal is a United States Army base adjacent to Huntsville, Alabama in the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge. A census-designated place in Madison County, Alabama, United States, it is part of the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area. The Arsenal is a host to over 75 tenant agencies including the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Justice (DOJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and NASA&#x27;s largest field center, the Marshall Space Flight Center.

The Arsenal today contains a government and contractor workforce that averages 36,000 to 40,000 personnel daily. The base has benefited from decisions by the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission and has a residential population of 837 as of 2020.

Established during World War II as a chemical manufacturing facility, in the immediate post-war era the Arsenal was used for research and development by Nazi German rocket scientists who were brought to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. The team first worked on ballistic missiles, starting with derivatives of the V-2 rocket, before moving on to a series of ever larger designs. In 1956 the Army was relieved of most of its ballistic missiles in favor of similar weapons operated by the US Air Force. The German design team was spun off to become part of the newly founded NASA. The Cold War had moved to space, and the U.S. intended to compete with the Soviet Union there and across the globe. The Arsenal served as the primary site for space launch vehicle design and testing into the 1960s.

==Geography==
Redstone Arsenal is located at . According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Redstone CDP has a total area of , all land, including extensive wetland areas associated with the Tennessee River and several local springs, much of which is maintained by the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge.

==History==
===Pre-1941===
The land occupied by the Redstone Arsenal was previously inhabited by Native Americans. A total of 651 prehistoric archaeological sites have been archived at Redstone Arsenal to date. At least 22 have components dating to the Paleo-Indian period (9200 to 8000 BC). The Paleo-Indian handhewn projectile point called the Redstone Point was named after the Arsenal where it was first identified.

Euro-Americans settlers began to establish homesteads on the land that is now Redstone Arsenal by the first decade of the 19th century. Prior to the Civil War, the landscape was dominated by several large plantations, the remains of which survive as archaeological sites. The land played a peripheral role during the Civil War with activity limited to the posting of pickets along the Tennessee River bank. Following the war, many of the large plantations were increasingly divided into smaller parcels owned by small farmers, who included former slaves and their descendants. By the start of the 20th century, many of the farms were owned by absentee owners, with the land being worked by tenants and sharecroppers. The remains of hundreds of tenant and sharecropper houses still dot the landscape around the installation.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the approximately area of rolling terrain, which contained some of the richest agricultural land in Madison County, included such small farming communities as Spring Hill, Pond Beat, Mullins Flat, and Union Hill. Although there was no electricity, indoor plumbing, or telephones, few roads, and fewer cars or tractors, the people who lived in the area prospered enough to support their own stores, mills, shops, gins, churches, and schools. A total of 46 historic cemeteries including slave cemeteries, plantation family cemeteries, and late 19th to early 20th century community cemeteries are maintained on the installation as Redstone Arsenal cemeteries.

===Huntsville Arsenal===
As part of the mobilization leading to U.S. involvement in World War II, Huntsville Arsenal was established in 1941 to create an inland chemical weapons plant in addition to one in Edgewood, Maryland. It was announced by the War Department on July 3, 1941. Over 550 families were displaced when the Army acquired the land, including over 300 tenants and sharecroppers. Most of the landowners were allowed to salvage their assets and rebuild elsewhere. The remaining buildings were almost all razed by the War Department. A land-use agreement was arranged with the Tennessee Valley Authority for the Army to use about of land along the Tennessee River.

The military installation was originally composed of three separate entities: the Huntsville Arsenal and the Huntsville Depot (later the Gulf Chemical Warfare Depot), which were operated under the auspices of the Chemical Warfare Service; and the Redstone Ordnance Plant, operated by the United States Army Ordnance Department. The name &quot;Redstone&quot; drew on the region&#x27;s red rocks and soil.

In the immediate post-war era the Arsenal was used for research and development by German weapons rocket scientists who had been brought to the U.S. as part of Operation Paperclip. The team first worked on ballistic missiles, starting with V-2 rocket derivatives, before moving on to a series of ever larger designs. Many of their tests were carried out at White Sands Missile Range and flights between the two locations were common. In late 1956 the Army was relieved of most of its ballistic missiles in favor of similar weapons operated by the US Air Force.

The German design team was spun off to become part of the newly founded National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The Cold War had moved to space, and the US intended to compete with the Soviet Union there as well as across the globe. The Arsenal served as the primary site for space launch vehicle design into the 1960s.
In its early years, the arsenal produced and stockpiled chemical weapons such as phosgene, Lewisite, and mustard gas. The use of toxic gases in warfare was banned under the Geneva Protocol of 1925, but the U.S. signed with the reservation that it be allowed to use chemical weapons against aggressors who used them. The facility also produced carbonyl iron powder (for radio and radar tuning), tear gas, and smoke and incendiary devices. The arsenal also produced small pyrotechnic devices including small solid-fuel rockets during the war. In recognition of its production record, the arsenal received the Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Award four times, the first on October 31, 1942. The ordnance plant was renamed Redstone Arsenal in 1943. Through the war years, more than 27,000,000 items of chemical munitions were produced and 45,200,000 ammunition shells were loaded. Redstone Army Airfield was established in 1943 for the 6th Army Air Force to test incendiary devices in preparation for the firebombing of Japanese cities.

Three days after the announcement of the Japanese surrender, production facilities at the installation were put on standby. After the war, Huntsville Arsenal was briefly used as the primary storage facility for the Chemical Warfare Service, and for manufacture of gas masks and dismantling of surplus incendiary bombs. Most of the wartime civilian workforce was furloughed, dropping to 600 from a wartime high of around 4,400. Much of the arsenal land was leased for agriculture, and many of the buildings were leased for local industry. By 1947, the installation was declared to be excess, the first step toward demilitarization.

Major political and commercial efforts were made in searching for government or business tenants for the space. In early 1948, several buildings of Huntsville Arsenal were leased by the newly formed Keller Motors Corporation with the intention of establishing a major automobile manufacturing complex. Only 18 Keller prototype vehicles were built before the firm&#x27;s president and primary organizer, George Keller, suddenly died and the operation folded.

The Army Air Forces was searching for a site to establish a major air development center and considered Huntsville Arsenal. In 1949, a competing site near Tullahoma, Tennessee was selected. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army then directed that Huntsville Arsenal be advertised for sale by 1 July 1949. The proposed sale never happened, because the Army found it needed the land for the new mission of developing and testing rocket systems. Thiokol Corporation moved operations to Redstone Arsenal from Maryland in the summer of 1949 to research and develop rocket propellants, while Rohm and Haas began work on rockets and jet propulsion. On June 30, 1949, Huntsville Arsenal was deactivated and consolidated with the other two entities to become Redstone Arsenal. Command responsibilities were assumed by Redstone.

===Army Ordnance Corps===
At the close of World War II, a number of key German scientists and engineers were brought to the United States under Operation Paperclip. Colonel Holger Toftoy arranged for 127 individuals, including Wernher von Braun, to receive contracts for work on Army missiles. In late 1945, they began arriving at Fort Bliss, Texas, where, using components brought from Germany, started upgrading the V-2 missile. Testing was done at the nearby White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico.

On June 1, 1949, the Chief of Ordnance of the United States Army designated Redstone Arsenal as the Ordnance Rocket Center, its facility for ordnance rocket research and development. In April 1950, the Fort Bliss missile development operation, then with 130 German contract employees, 120 civil-service employees, and 500 military personnel, was transferred to Redstone Arsenal. This became the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC), with Major James Hamill as acting commander and von Braun as technical director. An initial project was the Major tactical missile.

Upon the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, OGMC was given the mission of developing a surface-to-surface ballistic missile with an objective range of . Starting with an upgraded Major missile, the design went through a series of improvements and ultimately became the PGM-11 with the popular name Redstone rocket. To expedite development, an existing engine was used, greatly reducing the operational range to between 58 and 200 miles.

During the Korean War, ammunition production was resumed at Redstone Arsenal. From July 1951 through July 1955, around 38,700,000 rounds of chemical artillery munitions were produced.

The Ordnance Missile Laboratories (OML) was formed in 1952 to coordinate research and development within the OGMC. Holger Toftoy, who had originally recruited von Braun and his team of missile specialists, was assigned to Huntsville and promoted to Brigadier General as director of the OML. Test operations were under Kurt Debus, who set up the Interim Test Stand and the launch facility at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Redstone static fire testing began in the spring of 1953, followed by the first launch at Cape Canaveral on August 20, 1953.

In addition to the Redstone rocket development, the OML had many other research and development programs. Under Toftoy, the organization included the R&amp;D Division under Col. Miles Birkett Chatfield, the Field Service Division under Maj. Ben Keyserling, and the Industrial Division. In the R&amp;D Division there were the Surface-to-Air Projects under Maj. Rudy Axelson, the Surface-to-Surface Division under Maj. Dan Breedon, and Special Projects under Lt. Colonel John O&#x27;Conner. Projects in Surface-to-Air included the Nike B (later called the Nike Hercules), Hawk and others. Surface-to-Surface projects were the Honest John, Little John, Lacrosse, and Corporal Type III; the liquid-fueled Corporal Type III was soon canceled and the solid Thiokol fueled Sergeant project started. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California Institute of Technology was an Army research operation at that time, as NASA did not exist at the time. It was JPL that designed the Corporal system and later was the R&amp;D designer of the Sergeant.

At a 1954 meeting of the Spaceflight Committee of the American Rocket Society, von Braun proposed placing a satellite into orbit using the Redstone with clusters of small solid-fuel rockets on top. The proposal, Project Orbiter, was rejected in 1955.

===Ordnance schools===
In March 1952, the commanding officer at Redstone Arsenal officially established the Provisional Redstone Ordnance School. In December, the Ordnance Guided Missile School (OGMS) was established, taking over the provisional operation. The OGMS greatly expanded through the years, occupying a large land area with many buildings and providing a wide variety of missile and munitions courses for thousands of students from the U.S. as well as many foreign countries. The name was later changed to the Missile and Munitions Center &amp; School in 1966 and then to the Ordnance Missile and Munitions Center and School in the mid-1980s. In 1994, the School Brigade disbanded and was replaced by the reformed 59th Ordnance Brigade, which had previously disbanded in Europe in 1992. The school was then renamed the Ordnance Munitions and Electronic Maintenance School in 2002 and moved to Fort Lee in 2011.

===Army Ballistic Missile Agency===
The Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), commanded by Maj. Gen. John Medaris, was formed on 1 February 1956, taking over from Redstone Arsenal the facilities and personnel of OGMC. Von Braun was the Director of ABMA&#x27;s Development Operations Division. Redstone Arsenal then became an Army post, supporting the ABMA and, in the future, other agencies. Medaris also commanded RSA, and BG Toftoy was deputy.

The ABMA&#x27;s primary mission was developing and fielding the Army&#x27;s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Jupiter. By August 1958, the system was delivered to the Air Force for early deployment overseas. Jupiter deployment to Turkey later proved to be a cause of and significant bargaining chip in the Cuban Missile Crisis. During his command, Medaris&#x27; operation also fielded the PGM-11 Redstone and MIM-23 Hawk missiles, accelerated the development of the Nike Zeus system, and began development of the MGM-31 Pershing missile system, which later played a role in ending the Cold War.

As part of the 1957–58 International Geophysical Year, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union proposed to launch a scientific satellite. Although von Braun had proposed in 1954 that the OML could place a satellite in Earth orbit, the Naval Research Laboratory, using its Vanguard rocket, was given this assignment.

On October 4, 1957, the USSR orbited &quot;Sputnik I&quot;, the first Earth satellite. A second Sputnik was launched a month later. On December 6, 1957, a first attempt to launch a satellite-carrying Vanguard failed. Toftoy, Medaris, and von Braun immediately pleaded for the opportunity to show what the Army&#x27;s &quot;space team&quot; could do. The go-ahead was given and on 31 January 1958, America&#x27;s first satellite, &quot;Explorer I&quot;, was placed into orbit using a modified Jupiter launch vehicle (a four-stage system designated Juno I).

By 1958, 20,000 civilian, military, and contractor workers were employed within Redstone Arsenal.

The Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC) was formed in March 1958. Headquartered at Redstone Arsenal and commanded by Maj. Gen. Medaris, AOMC had several subordinate elements, including ABMA, White Sands Missile Range, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology. Another local activity, the Army Rocket and Guided Missile Agency (ARGMA), was formed and added to AOMC in June.

Six months after &quot;Explorer I&quot;, President Dwight Eisenhower created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on July 29, 1958. On October 21, 1959, he approved the transfer of all Army space-related activities to NASA. This was accomplished effective July 1, 1960, when 4,670 civilian employees, about $100 million worth of buildings and equipment, and of land transferred from RSA/ABMA&#x27;s Development Operations Division to NASA&#x27;s George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Von Braun was MSFC&#x27;s first director.

===Army Missile Command===
The U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM) was activated on August 1, 1962 at Redstone Arsenal, absorbing all of the personnel, facilities, and projects remaining in the prior AOMC. On March 12, 1964, the Francis J. McMorrow Missile Laboratories were dedicated in memory of MICOM&#x27;s first commander, who died while in command.

Dating from the start of AMC, Project Nike involving anti-aircraft missiles had been conducted. As the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) came into being, a much higher-performance system was needed for ICBM defense. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) examined the requirements and recommending a system, designated Nike-X, incorporating phased-array radars, high-performance computers, and separate low-altitude (Sprint) and high-altitude (Spartan) high-velocity interceptor missiles. To manage this development, in 1963 MICOM created the Nike-X Project Office headed by Colonel (later Brigadier General) Ivy O. Drewry.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China exploded its first thermonuclear bomb in June 1967. Hence, ABM system requirements were revised and the Sentinel System was born, replacing Nike-X. In 1968, the Army Ballistic Missile Defense Agency (ABMDA) was formed, taking over Sentinel and other ballistic missile defense projects previously under MICOM. Commanded by B. G. Drewry, ABMDA established operations adjacent to Redstone Arsenal in the Cummings Research Park. In May 1974, all ballistic missile defense efforts were consolidated under a single manager in the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, which eventually evolved into today&#x27;s U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command.

On July 17, 1997, the former Army Missile Command combined with the aviation portion of the U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command (ATCOM), creating a new organization at RSA, the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM).

===Today===
Redstone Arsenal remains the center of testing, development, and doctrine for the Army&#x27;s missile programs. Besides the U.S. Army Materiel Command and the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command, Redstone houses the Tactical UAV Project Office, Redstone Test Center (RTC), the Missile Defense Agency, the Missile and Space Intelligence Center, and other operations.

After operating as a tenant on Redstone Arsenal for over half a century, the Ordnance Munitions and Maintenance School was moved to Fort Lee (now Fort Gregg-Adams), Virginia.

Redstone Arsenal continues to host the Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA&#x27;s largest field center for propulsion analysis and development, which developed the Saturn rocket family in the 1960s and propulsion systems for the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and 1980s.

Redstone Scientific Information Center (RSIC), a 450,000-volume library established by NASA and the Army in 1962, was shuttered on September 30, 2019. The cost-saving measure was announced by Combat Capabilities Development Command Aviation &amp; Missile Center (AvMC); selected documents from RSIC were acquired by NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center.

Triana was originally incorporated on November 13, 1819, as the second town in Madison County. It purportedly was named after Rodrigo de Triana, the crewman who first sighted land while sailing with Christopher Columbus on their first voyage to the Americas. For a time in the 19th century, it was a thriving riverport on the Tennessee River prior to the construction of the railroads. Its incorporation later lapsed and it was reincorporated on July 13, 1964, with the help of Clyde Foster, who later became Triana&#x27;s mayor. Until the 2020 census, it was the only incorporated community in Madison County with a majority black population.

==DDT pollution==
In 1977, the EPA issued warnings that fish and waterfowl from the Huntsville Spring Branch had shown high levels of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in their bodies. Two years later, the EPA began to investigate how the pollutant had contaminated the water supply of the area. The findings indicated that the pollutant came from the Olin Corporation&#x27;s production of the chemical on Redstone Arsenal. Lawsuits were filed against Olin Corporation by residents of Triana, as well as the United States Department of Justice. These lawsuits were eventually settled.

The water near Triana was monitored by the EPA from 1982–1995 to track the levels of DDT that was still in the Huntsville Spring Branch. During that time, the amount of DDT in the water was reduced by 97%. The EPA now considers the physical cleanup process for the site to be complete. Despite this, it is still on the Agency&#x27;s Superfund list.

==Education==
It is served by the Madison City Schools school district.

<text>Demopolis is the largest city in Marengo County, in west-central Alabama. The population was 7,162 at the 2020 census.

The city lies at the confluence of the Black Warrior River and Tombigbee River. It is situated atop a cliff composed of the Demopolis Chalk Formation, known locally as White Bluff, on the east bank of the Tombigbee. It is at the center of Alabama&#x27;s Canebrake region and is also within the Black Belt region.

Demopolis was founded in the early 1800s after the fall of Napoleon&#x27;s empire. It was named by a group of French expatriates, a mix of exiled Bonapartists and other French refugees who had settled in the United States after the overthrow of the colonial government in Saint-Domingue by enslaved workers. Napoleon had sent troops there in a last attempt to regain control of the island, but they were defeated, largely by high mortality due to yellow fever.

The name, meaning in Greek &quot;the People&#x27;s City&quot; or &quot;City of the People&quot; (from Ancient Greek &quot;δῆμος&quot; + &quot;πόλις&quot;), was chosen to honor the democratic ideals behind the endeavor. First settled in 1817, it is one of the oldest continuous settlements in the interior of Alabama. French colonists had founded Mobile on the coast in the early 18th century. Demopolis was incorporated on December 11, 1821.

==History==
===Colonization===
Organizing first in Philadelphia, French expatriates petitioned the U.S. Congress to sell them property for land to colonize. Congress granted approval by an act on March 3, 1817, that allowed them to buy four townships in the Alabama Territory at $2 per acre, with the provision that they cultivate grape vines and olive trees. Following advice obtained from experienced pioneers, they determined that Alabama would provide a good climate for cultivating these crops. By July 14, 1817, a small party of pioneers had settled at White Bluff on the Tombigbee River, at the present site of Demopolis, founding the Vine and Olive Colony.

Among the wealthiest and most prominent of the group was Count Lefebvre Desnouettes, who had been a cavalry officer under Napoleon, with the rank of lieutenant-general. He had ridden in Napoleon&#x27;s carriage during his failed invasion of Russia. Other prominent figures among the immigrants included Lieutenant-General Baron Henri-Dominique Lallemand, Count Bertrand Clauzel, Joseph Lakanal, Simon Chaudron, Pasqual Luciani, Colonel Jean-Jerome Cluis, Jean-Marie Chapron, Colonel Nicholas Raoul, and Frederic Ravesies. Most of these expatriates had little interest in pioneer life and sold their shares in the colony, remaining in Philadelphia. By 1818, the colony consisted of only 69 settlers.

The party encountered a variety of adversities. Following a survey in August 1818, they learned that their new properties did not fall under the territories encompassed by the congressional approval, and the Vine and Olive Colony was soon forced to move. Their actual land grants began less than a mile to the east of their newly cleared land. After abandoning the settlement of Demopolis, they soon established two other towns, Aigleville and Arcola.

===American settlement===

Upon learning of the survey and that the French grants lay elsewhere, American settlers began to quickly purchase the property of the former French settlement, intending to develop it as a major river port on the Tombigbee. A land company, the White Bluff Association (later renamed as the Company of the Town of Demopolis), was formed in 1819 with the express purpose to purchase the land and lay off a town. George Strother Gaines was named as the company spokesman, and he bought the town site atop White Bluff as soon as it was offered for sale. Commissioners for the company were George Strother Gaines, James Childress, Walter Crenshaw, Count Charles Lefebvre Desnouettes, and Dr. Joseph B. Earle.

The commissioners were responsible for overseeing the site survey, lot sales, and the early operations of the town. The commissioners laid off the site into streets, blocks, and lots, with a block of roughly two acres divided into eight lots. Demopolis Town Square, encompassing one city block, was established in 1819. The first lots were sold beginning on April 22, 1819. When Count Desnouettes died in 1822, Allen Glover was appointed to replace him. As other commissioners retired, they were succeeded by David E. Moore, William H. Lyon, Thomas McGee, and George N. Stewart.

The streets were laid off using a grid plan, with the city of Philadelphia as a model. The original streets running north–south were named for trees, such as Ash, Cedar, Cherry, and Chestnut. Exceptions were made for Commissioners, Strawberry, and Market (now Main) streets. Several short north–south streets were also named for commissioners, such as Desnouettes, Earle, Glover, Griffin, and McGee. The east–west streets were named for national and local heroes, as well as commissioners, such as Childress, Fulton, Gaines, Lyon, Monroe, Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, and Jackson. Most streets were designed to be wide. A strip of land that remained public property, for the use of all, was the land adjoining the Tombigbee River. This extended from where Riverside Cemetery is today, to the southwest of the city proper, to the Upper Landing in the north, with Arch Street following the route along the top of the cliff. Only the portion of Arch Street adjacent to the cemetery remains intact.

Some flaws and limitations of the original town plan became apparent by the late 1820s and 1830s. The typical town lots, at wide and deep, were not conducive to construction of the stately homes desired by the more prosperous residents. Some grand mansions were completed by the late 1820s. One of the first was the brick -story Federal-style Allen Glover house at the foot of Capitol Street. It was one of the, if not the first, neoclassical structures to be built in Marengo County. Glover built Bluff Hall (1832) for his daughter, Sarah Serena, and son-in-law, Francis Strother Lyon.

The town plan was also lacking a clearly defined business district, resulting in commercial and residential buildings mixed together all over town. As development shifted, some areas became blighted because of less desirable uses. Some stores opened around the town square, however, and warehouses started to appear adjacent to the town&#x27;s three major river landings, Upper Landing, above the modern Demopolis Yacht Basin and Marina; Webb&#x27;s Landing at the western terminus of Washington Street; and Lower Landing to the west of Riverside Cemetery and the Whitfield Canal.

By the 1830s Demopolis had developed into a regional commercial river hub, attracting American and European-born craftsmen and merchants, including the Beysiegle, Breitling, Breton, Dupertuis, Foster, Hummell, Kirker, Knapp, Marx, Michael, Mulligan, Oberling, Rhodes, Rudisill, Rosenbaum, Schmidt, Shahan, Stallings, and Zaiser families. Numerous plantation owners also established townhouses in the community or on its outskirts, including the Allen, Ashe, Curtis, DuBose, Foscue, Glover, Griffin, Lane, Lyon, McAllister, Prout, Reese, Strudwick, Tayloe, Whitfield, and Vaughan families.

But Demopolis was not dominated by a homogeneous elite planter class, as happened in other towns of the region. During these years and in the future, the river trade also brought numerous people with a desire for raucous entertainment. This created a profitable and brisk trade for those operating taverns and did much to earn early Demopolis a reputation for decadence.

During the 1840s many of the streets laid out by the town fathers had yet to be opened to traffic. The town council focused attention on clearing the intended streets and opening them to traffic, making other street improvements, and building wooden sidewalks along major thoroughfares to lift pedestrians above the mud. The council also approved measures to protect trees in the common areas and streets.

Several town ordinances were enacted in 1842 to restrain the enslaved African-American population. They were prohibited from selling or purchasing any article or commodity from or to a slave without written permission from their master or overseer. No slave was allowed to purchase alcohol without written consent; if any slave were convicted of assault upon &quot;any white man, negro, or mulatto&quot;, the owner would be fined $50; any slave caught running &quot;any horse, gelding, or mule&quot; through town would be subject to fifteen lashes unless the owner paid a fine of $1; any slave caught driving any wagon or cart or driving a horse or mule on or across the sidewalks of the town would be subject to 10 lashes, unless the owner paid a fine of 50 cents.

The robust, frontier river town did not support the orderly organization of churches. A group of Methodist ministers who convened nearby in 1843 said that Demopolis was &quot;wholly irreligious&quot;. Mainline Protestant churches were slow to take root; no churches were built in Demopolis until 1840. Prior to that time, various denominations met in a log assembly house on the town square. It was torn down in 1844. A Baptist group was established in the 1820s but disbanded due to a lack of support. The Episcopalians established a congregation in 1834, but did not build Trinity Episcopal Church until 1850. A Presbyterian congregation was established in 1839 and completed its first church in 1843, a brick structure on the town square. The Methodist congregation was established in 1840 and completed its first building in 1843.

Present in Demopolis from the beginning, with the French Catholic immigrants, the Catholic congregation in town was listed in 1851 as a mission of Saint John the Baptist in Tuscaloosa. It was switched to being supported by a church in Selma in 1880. They met in a small frame church and private homes until 1905, when the current Saint Leo the Great was built.

The Jewish congregation, B&#x27;nai Jeshurun, was established in 1858, although the community had been present since the 1840s. B&#x27;nai Jeshurun was the fourth Jewish congregation established in Alabama. They initially met in homes and businesses until eventually building a Moorish Revival-style temple in 1893.

By the 1850s several palatial steamboats were visiting the town as a regular stop on the Mobile to Columbus, Mississippi, route along the Tombigbee. These included the &quot;Forest Monarch&quot;, &quot;Alice Vivian&quot;, and the ill-fated &quot;Eliza Battle&quot;. Several others were dedicated almost exclusively to Demopolis and the cotton trade, including the &quot;Allen Glover&quot;, &quot;Canebrake&quot;, &quot;Cherokee&quot;, &quot;Demopolis&quot;, &quot;Frank Lyon&quot;, &quot;Marengo&quot;, and the &quot;Mollie Glover&quot;. Major hotels during this same period included the Planter&#x27;s Hotel, later known as Madison House Hotel, and the River Hotel.

In 1853 a yellow fever epidemic struck the city. Some people were buried in an ill-defined two-acre cemetery to the north of town in the river bend. The Jewish Cemetery was established in 1878 to the east of town on Jefferson Street. The Glover Mausoleum had been completed on the banks of the Tombigbee in 1845, with the burial of many family members in and around it. Finally the city established its main burial ground, Riverside Cemetery, selling plots to the public in 1882.

A circular Gothic Revival-style amphitheater, complete with a crenelated roof-line, was completed in 1859 north of town in Webb&#x27;s Bend at the fairgrounds. The fairgrounds and its buildings covered approximately and hosted a variety of events until the outbreak of the Civil War.

By 1860, the population within the town limits had grown to approximately 1,200 people. The town began to attract new entertainments, such as musical and dramatic performances, concert artists, lecturers, circuses, and carnivals.

===Civil War and aftermath===

Marengo County, with its large number of slaveholders, favored secession from the Union and the formation of the Confederate States of America. White residents of Demopolis shared these sentiments. Prominent secessionists included Nathan B. Whitfield, Francis S. Lyon, Goodman G. Griffin, Kimbrough C. DuBose, George B. Lyon, Dr. James D. Browder, and George E. Markham. But many other powerful men in town opposed secession, including Benjamin Glover Shields, William H. Lyon, Jr., William B. Jones, Pearson J. Glover, Gaius Whitfield, Alfred Hatch, Joel C. DuBose, Robert V. Montague, and Henry Augustine Tayloe. In the end, most men on both sides of the argument joined in the Confederate cause once secession was inevitable. It is not known whether the Jewish community supported or not the Union or opposed slavery.

With the start of the Civil War, several Confederate companies recruited from the population of Demopolis and Marengo County. The 4th, 11th, 21st, 23rd, and 43rd Alabama Infantry Regiments, in addition to the 8th Alabama Cavalry, Company E of the Jeff. Davis Legion, and Selden&#x27;s Battery, were all established by local men. During the course of the war, more of these men would be lost to disease, exhaustion, and malnutrition than to battle casualties, as happened in both armies.

The city, based on two navigable rivers and a railroad, was used as the base for a number of Confederate installations and offices. These included commissary and quartermaster offices and warehouses, engineers&#x27; offices and workshops, a large ordnance depot, two large hospitals, and offices of the medical purveyor of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. A huge military encampment was established at the fairgrounds in Webb&#x27;s Bend. After the fall of Vicksburg and Port Hudson in July, 1863, several regiments of paroled Confederate troops were sent to a camp at Demopolis to await exchange. Thousands of soldiers entered the town at a time, which had only one thousand inhabitants prior to the war. Residents struggled to provide and secure sufficient food and accommodations.

Many hundreds of the soldiers who died in the hospitals during the war were buried in a Confederate cemetery on the south end of Webb&#x27;s Bend. Today the site is underwater, following the damming of the river below Demopolis in the 20th century.

After the loss of its primary east–west railroad during the war, in 1862 the Confederate government completed the Alabama and Mississippi Rivers Railroad from Selma through Demopolis and to Meridian, Mississippi. The project had been in the works since the 1850s, but several miles between Demopolis and Uniontown had not been finished when war erupted. As the war raged in all directions around Demopolis in 1864, the city was subjected to a huge influx of war refugees. Nathan B. Whitfield noted in his journal that those from Mobile had taken every available vacant house, and others were crowded with local people, along with their descendants and relatives.

In March 1865 the people of Demopolis prepared to defend the town against Union threats, and fortified key positions. Three circular batteries, surrounded by earthworks, were constructed and other fortifications built across the southern reaches of town. With the impending fall of Selma in early April, during Wilson&#x27;s Raid, all of the railroad&#x27;s rolling stock was sent full of supplies westward through Demopolis and on to Meridian. A flotilla of eighteen Confederate gunboats and packet ships were relocated to the Tombigbee River at Demopolis around this same time. These included the CSS &quot;Nashville&quot;, CSS &quot;Morgan&quot;, CSS &quot;Baltic&quot;, the &quot;Southern Republic&quot;, &quot;Black Diamond&quot;, &quot;Admiral&quot;, &quot;Clipper&quot;, &quot;Farrand&quot;, &quot;Marengo&quot; and &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;.

With the surrender of the last of the Confederates, Demopolis found itself a much different city from what it had been prior to the war. At the end of May 1865, the townspeople learned that an occupying force of Federal soldiers, the 5th Minnesota Infantry, were en route to occupy the town. Once there, they occupied the former fairgrounds. Despite the usual unpleasantness associated with the occupation of many defeated Southern towns, two of the Minnesota commanders, Colonel William B. Gere and General Lucius Frederick Hubbard, apparently came to be well-liked by the townspeople. Despite some bright spots in relations, the Episcopal Church in the South was slow to give up on the notion of the Confederacy, resulting in the military governor of Alabama closing all Episcopal churches in the state, effective on September 20, 1865. Trinity Episcopal Church in Demopolis was put under Federal guard, and during this time the church mysteriously burned down. Blame was placed on the soldiers for intentionally burning it, but this has never been borne out by the facts. Aside from all of this, the more pressing matter was the devastated economy of the community and surrounding countryside, a problem that would continue through the Reconstruction era.

During Reconstruction, the new authorities in charge of the government decided to move the county seat of Marengo from its central location in Linden to Demopolis by an act approved on December 4, 1868. The county appointed Richard Jones Jr., Lewis B. McCarty, and Dr. Bryan W. Whitfield to build or buy a new courthouse in Demopolis. They negotiated the purchase of the Presbyterian church on the town square, now known as Rooster Hall, for the sum of $3,000. It was conveyed to the county on April 8, 1869. The county built a fireproof brick building next door to the former church in 1869–70 to house the probate and circuit clerk offices. This building serves as Demopolis City Hall today. The move of the county seat was highly controversial, and the Alabama Legislature set April 18, 1870, as the date for a county-wide referendum to decide if Dayton, Demopolis, or Linden would become the county seat. Due to the closeness of the vote and voting irregularities, a run-off between Linden and Demopolis was set for May 14, 1870. Irregularities appeared again and votes from Dayton, mostly in favor of Linden, were rejected by the board of supervisors. Linden continued an attempt to persuade the state legislature to move the county seat back to their town, with success in February 1871. The former courthouse buildings reverted from county ownership to Demopolis and remain city property today.

===20th century===
The struggle to rebuild the economy of Demopolis and the surrounding region continued into the 20th century. The growing, trading, and milling of cotton continued to be a major basis of the economy up until the World War I-era. The boll weevil infestations of the 1920s and the Great Depression of the 1930s finally ended the one-crop farming system.

Demopolis had electric lights, water works and a sewerage system, chert-covered streets, paved sidewalks, and a fire department by the second decade of the 20th century. It was increasingly serving as a major banking and retail hub in the region during this time. Major financial institutions included the Commercial National Bank, City Bank and Trust Company, and Robertson Banking Company. One of the first large department stores of note in the area, Mayer Brothers, built its three-story brick building across from the public square in 1897 and operated for most of the 20th century. That building is now utilized by Robertson Banking Company. The Rosenbush Furniture Company was established in 1895 and operated until 2002. The J. H. Spight Grocery was established in 1901 as one of the earliest and most successful grocery stores for more than 50 years, prior to the era of corporate chain stores. Although the community had many newspapers throughout its first 100 years, the only one to survive into the 21st century, &quot;The Demopolis Times&quot;, was established in 1904.
Theaters sprang up in the city, beginning in the late 19th century. Rooster Hall, following its incarnations as a church, courthouse, and then a city property, was leased for use as the Demopolis Opera House from 1876 to 1902. It hosted live dramatic performances, civic lectures, and minstrel shows. The Braswell Opera House, with its ornate interior and private box galleries, opened on October 23, 1902, with a performance of Louisiana playwright Epsy William&#x27;s &quot;Unorna&quot;, from Francis Marion Crawford&#x27;s &quot;The Witch of Prague&quot;. It continued as an entertainment venue into the 1920s and was eventually demolished in 1972–73. The first theater built for the presentation of motion pictures, the Elks Theater, opened on October 1, 1915. It was renamed the Si-Non in 1916. The building was restored during the 1990s.

Following the demise of cotton production, beef cattle farming and, more recently, catfish aquaculture became new major agricultural pursuits. Industrial activities became the major sources of employment by mid-century, with the cement, lumber, and paper industries playing a prominent role in the city&#x27;s economy into the 21st century.

==In popular culture==
The Marx and Newhouse families of Demopolis were reputedly the inspiration for &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, a Broadway play. The melodrama was written by Lillian Hellman, whose maternal ancestors were all natives of Demopolis. It was first performed in 1939, with Alabama-born actress Tallulah Bankhead in the lead role of Regina. This production ran a year on Broadway. The 1941 film version was directed by William Wyler and starred Bette Davis, Herbert Marshall and Teresa Wright. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture in 1941. In 1949 the play was adapted into an opera by Marc Blitzstein, under the title &quot;Regina&quot;.

Lillian Hellman&#x27;s 1946 play, &quot;Another Part of the Forest&quot;, was also loosely based on her Demopolis ancestors.

The 1949 film &quot;The Fighting Kentuckian&quot; is set in Demopolis and tells a story about an interaction with the original French settlers. The basic plot features two Kentuckians returning from service with Andrew Jackson&#x27;s forces in the War of 1812. Their unit passes through the port of Mobile, Alabama, where John Breen, played by John Wayne, meets the pretty Fleurette De Marchand, played by Vera Ralston, from Demopolis. He makes sure the unit passes through Demopolis on its way back home and he stays there as the unit leaves. He discovers that De Marchand is about to marry a wealthy riverman and a love triangle ensues, with Breen eventually winning out.

The 2015 play &quot;Alabama Story&quot; has a subplot featuring the characters Joshua Moore and Lily Whitfield, who grew up in Demopolis as childhood friends on Lily&#x27;s father&#x27;s cotton plantation, now estranged.

==Phillips High School==
The local high school is Phillips High School, home of the Bears. The original wooden frame school building across the highway from the present location of Phillips School held grades 1-9. This building caught fire around Christmas of 1925. Local churches provided temporary space for the teachers and pupils.

Mrs. John Robert Phillips graciously donated land for a new school on April 16, 1926. Her husband, who died in April 1925, wanted the addition of a high school. The community pulled together with its volunteer labor and donated timber from virgin pines in Bear Creek. Members of the community sacrificed time and money in their participation with the construction of the new Phillips School. Logging was done by wagon and hauled to Veal&#x27;s sawmill. Brick arrived by rail and was transported by wagon to the site. McKinley Campbell, assisted by his brother, was the contractor for the new facility.

The first graduation was held at Phillips High School in 1929. Agricultural and home economics (aka Family and Consumer Sciences) departments were added in 1935 and housed near the present location of the cafeteria. The football field was located behind the main building, which was later replaced in 1969.

On September 2, 2003, the Phillips football field (James E. Glass Stadium) was named after Coach James E. Glass in honor of the dedication he has given to the football team and school throughout the years. The football field was the first football field in the state of Alabama to be lighted, which took place in the fall of 1933. The original lights brightened the football field until the 2010 season, when a grant for new lights was awarded to both the football and baseball facilities of the school.

Phillips High School has won four state championships in sports. This includes back-to-back state titles in 1985 and 1986 in girls varsity basketball, followed in 2001 by girls volleyball. The She Bear basketball team won the State 1A basketball championship in 2019.

<text>Brilliant is a town in Marion County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census the population was 845.

==History==
In the late part of the 19th century, the discovery of coal led to the development of the Aldridge Mining Company in 1897 (later, in 1906, named the Brilliant Coal Company), which was located adjacent to the town. The Brilliant Coal Company served as a catalyst for growth for the area and provided ample employment for more than 50 years.

The towns of Brilliant and Boston were so closely associated that no attempt was made to separate their history. Eventually, in 1957, with the passage of Act 284 by the Alabama Legislature, Boston was incorporated into the town of Brilliant, and the name &quot;Boston&quot; was dropped. Boston had originally taken its name in honor of Jimmy L. Bostick, one of the first settlers of the town. The name &quot;Brilliant&quot; is derived from the glossy sheen found on the type of high-grade coal that was mined near the town, before the demise of the Brilliant Coal Company in 1953. The coal was said to burn so brilliantly, due to its composition of only 2 ash, 1 sulfur and no clinker.

At the turn of the 20th century, the Brilliant and Boston area was the most densely populated part of Marion County.

By the end of the 1950s the Brilliant Coal Company had shuttered its mining operations; however, several smaller mining operations were in business around the area until the early 1990s.

From 1987 until 2000 the town was home to Brilliant Homes Ltd., a manufacturer of mobile homes. The company was acquired by American Homestar Corporation of League City, Texas, in 1997. The plant was closed on April 15, 2000, due to declining sales throughout the manufactured housing industry. American Homestar Corporation subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy later in 2001.

Employers in the town include a garment manufacturing plant, Tullahoma Industries, which produces garments for the U.S. Army, and Stone Canyon Cabins, which manufactures park model cabins at the site of the old Brilliant Homes plant.

The following is from an August 30, 1957, &quot;Winfield Journal&quot; article:
&quot;Boston is Now Brilliant; Act Also Extends Corporate Limits&quot;

<text>Guin is a city in Marion County, Alabama, United States. It incorporated in December 1889. At the 2020 census, the population was 2,195.

==History==
Guin takes its name from a young country doctor, Dr. Jeremiah (&quot;Jerry&quot;) Guin from Tuscaloosa County, who purchased the farm known then as Haley&#x27;s Trading Post (where is now situate the town of Guin) from a certain John T. Meador in 1870, and who, in turn, had bought the property from a certain Alan Haley, a newcomer to the State, who had built there a country store on the most used road stretching from north to south, in order to accommodate cattle drovers taking their cattle to market in Columbus and Aberdeen, Mississippi. Jeremiah Guin, while looking for a place to make his home, moved the center of interest about a mile east of Haley&#x27;s Trading Post (now 12th Street N. and 11 Ave. in present-day Guin).

In the early years of its settlement, a saw mill was built and operated in the town, known originally as Kenney Lumber Company (and later known as Brown Lumber Co.), supplying cut timber to the local community.

The city was first called &quot;Toll Gate&quot;, but its name later changed in honor of one of its distinguished citizens, Captain Albert James Hamilton (known as A.J. Hamilton), who had represented Marion County in the state legislature in the sessions of 1869, 1874 and 1875. Captain Hamilton donated forty acres of his land to the town. The same forty acres were then divided into lots and sold to help defray the cost of building the courthouse. The Toll Gate community was elected in 1881 to be the next county seat, and by 1883 the Marion County courthouse in Pikeville had ceased to be functional. When the courthouse was moved from Pikeville to Toll Gate, the town&#x27;s name was then changed from Toll Gate to Hamilton. On March 30, 1887, the newly built county courthouse was destroyed by fire. It was again rebuilt with wood, but replaced in 1901 with native sandstone.

During the Civil War, Union forces passed through the town in search of goods and horses. A detachment of Wilson&#x27;s Cavalry destroyed by fire the plantation belonging to the Helvingstons on the Military Ford, south of Toll Gate (Hamilton).

<text>Albertville is a city in Marshall County, Alabama, United States, and is included in the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area. The population was 22,386 at the 2020 census. It is the largest city in Marshall County.

==History==
The area which today includes Albertville was inhabited by the indigenous Cherokee, until their removal to Oklahoma in the 1830s. It was near the territory of the Creek nation, and several major trails which afforded communication (or military action) between the two nations crossed the area. It is believed to have been crossed by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto during his expeditions in 1540.

During the American Civil War, the area around Albertville was the scene of several mid-level clashes between Union and Confederate forces.

The first non-indigenous settlement in what is today Albertville began in the 1850s. It was named for Thomas A. Albert, an early settler who moved from Georgia and was a town leader until his death in 1876. The city was incorporated in 1891. A post office was established in 1910.

At about 4:10 p.m. on April 24, 1908, the city was virtually wiped out by a tornado that became commonly called &quot;The Great Cyclone&quot;, or &quot;The Cyclone of 1908&quot;. The storm is believed to have killed 35 people across northeastern Alabama, including 15 in Albertville. Relief was largely delivered by railroad, particularly from the nearby city of Gadsden. Trains from Gadsden transported doctors, nurses, and the Queen City Guards, the Alabama militia company based in Gadsden. The commander of the latter, future Gadsden mayor and Col. R.A. Mitchell, reported in a dispatch to Governor B.B. Comer:

 ... The destruction of property here is, I think, unprecedented in the history of the state. I have never seen anything like it, so complete and absolute as to leave little of worth in the path of the storm through town. On viewing the wreckage, covering easily forty acres or more in the heart of town, it appears incredible that any living being could have escaped the fury of the storm and death ...

In 1893, the Alabama Legislature passed an act for the erection of an agricultural college in each of the state&#x27;s congressional districts. After some competition, Albertville was awarded the school for the Seventh District. This is the school that evolved into today&#x27;s Albertville High School, whose sports teams are still known as the &quot;Aggies&quot;.

In 1910, Albertville had a population of 1,544, becoming the largest community in Marshall County.

Before the New Deal, when the Tennessee Valley Authority built Guntersville Dam, flooding on the Tennessee River would frequently leave the county courthouse in Guntersville inaccessible for residents of Albertville and other areas atop Sand Mountain. In 1919, the Alabama Legislature responded by requiring the erection of a courthouse at Albertville, in which cases arising in that part of the county would be heard.

In 1950, Albertville had a population of 5,397, and reclaimed the title (from Guntersville) of the largest city in the county, and has held the distinction ever since.

On June 1, 2009, the city council voted to establish English as the town&#x27;s official language. Albertville’s Hispanic demographic pluraity strongly protested this decision in a series of demonstrations near the mayor’s office.

On April 24, 2010, an EF-3 tornado ripped through downtown Albertville. The storm resulted in no deaths. The high school was severely damaged, nearly every home had some type of damage, and many were destroyed beyond repair.

==Geography==
Albertville is located in southeastern Marshall County, and is bordered to the southeast by the city of Boaz and to the northwest by the city of Guntersville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , is water.

The city sits at an elevation of atop Sand Mountain, a plateau that in this area is about wide. The Tennessee Valley Divide passes through the southern part of the city. The majority of the city drains north to Short Creek, a tributary of the Tennessee River, while the southern part drains to Slab Creek, a west-flowing tributary of the Locust Fork of the Black Warrior River. The current slogan of Albertville is &quot;The Heart of Sand Mountain&quot;, which can be seen on the welcome sign coming into the city.

<text>Guntersville (previously known as Gunter&#x27;s Ferry and later Gunter&#x27;s Landing) is a city and the county seat of Marshall County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population of the city was 8,553. Guntersville is located in a HUBZone as identified by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).

==History==
Guntersville was founded by John Gunter (1765–1835), the great-grandfather of American humorist Will Rogers. Gunter&#x27;s own great-great-grandfather, of Welsh-English descent, had emigrated to the New World in 1644. Gunter was the wealthy owner of a salt mine in the early 19th century. In order to obtain more land to mine, Gunter struck a deal with the Cherokee tribe that inhabited the area to use in his household as servants. As part of the deal, Gunter married the daughter (Ghe-No-He-Li, aka Katy and Cathrine) of the tribe&#x27;s chief (Chief Bushyhead of the Paint Clan) and agreed to give salt to the tribe. A town sprung up next to the mine and was named after Gunter. The town of Guntersville puts on a festival every July to celebrate Will Rogers, which involves many activities which were of interest to Rogers.

Initially incorporated as &quot;Gunter&#x27;s Landing&quot; in 1848, it won the contest to become county seat from Warrenton (which had been the seat since 1841). It formally changed its name to Guntersville in 1854.

The United States Navy began operating a fleet of gunboats on the Tennessee River in late 1864. Confederate troops mounted a spirited defense of the river from Guntersville. In January 1865, the USS &quot;General Grant&quot; attempted to destroy the town in retaliation.

For much of the 20th century, the economy of Guntersville revolved around cotton processing, especially with the Saratoga Victory Mill.

<doc id="104904" wikidata="Q79711" url="?curid=104904" title="Bayou La Batre, Alabama">
<text>Bayou La Batre ( or ) is a city in Mobile County, Alabama, United States. It is part of the Mobile metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 2,204, down from 2,558 at the 2010 census.

Bayou La Batre is a fishing village with a seafood-processing harbor for fishing boats and shrimp boats. The local chamber of commerce has described the city as the &quot;Seafood Capitol of Alabama&quot; for packaging seafood from hundreds of fishing boats.

Bayou La Batre was founded in 1786, when French-born Joseph Bouzage (or Bosarge) [1733-1795] was awarded a Spanish land grant on the West Bank of the bayou (see history below). The modern city of Bayou La Batre was incorporated in 1955.

On August 29, 2005, the area was devastated by Hurricane Katrina, which produced the largest storm surge ever recorded in the area, reaching nearly and pushing many shrimp boats and the cargo ship &quot;M/V Caribbean Clipper&quot; onto shore.

==History==

As part of the French settlement of the Gulf Coast, the bayou was originally called &quot;Riviere D&#x27;Erbane&quot; and acquired the present name from the French-maintained battery of artillery on the west bank (&quot;bayou of the battery&quot;). Bayou La Batre was the first permanent settlement on the south Mobile County mainland and was founded in 1786, when Joseph Bouzage (Bosarge) [1733-95] moved into the area and was awarded a Spanish land grant on the bayou&#x27;s west bank.

Born in Poitiers, France, Joseph Bouzage came to the Gulf Coast circa 1760, married Catherine Louise Baudreau (Boudreau) on June 5, 1762, and was the father of seven children, including one son, Jean Baptiste.

On August 29, 2005, the area was devastated by Hurricane Katrina, with a local storm surge of nearly and higher waves that engulfed Bayou La Batre and pushed over 23 shrimp boats and the cargo ship &quot;M/V Caribbean Clipper&quot; onto shore. The captain rode out Katrina on the cargo ship, owned by Caribbean Shipping Inc., and the ship was returned to sea six months later, using a large crane.

On September 7, the &quot;Hurricane Katrina Update&quot; for libraries affected by the storm indicated that the Bayou La Batre Public Library (then known as Mose Hudson Tapia Public Library) had been destroyed.

Students from the Alba Middle School documented the destruction through a series of photos that were exhibited at various venues in Alabama and the Chicago, Illinois region. Some of these were published in a book titled &quot;Eyes of the Storm: A Community Survives after Katrina&quot; ().

Immediately following the hurricane a group of high school students from Sierra High School in Truckee, California adopted the city of Bayou La Batre. They sent roughly $15,000, supplies, and 15 students to help rebuild homes. Students gathered donations, sold raffle tickets, and filled their school&#x27;s gym with supplies from bedding and clothes to basic household items. The school also set up a pen pal program with the students of the nearby school in Bayou La Batre.
In October 2005, seven weeks after Hurricane Katrina, Bayou La Batre was adopted by the city of Santa Monica, California &quot;(see: &quot;Santa Monica Pier&quot;)&quot; to assist in clean-up activities. The Santa Monica City Council approved loaning Bayou La Batre 18 vehicles, including six pickups, two trucks with large cranes, utility vehicles with smaller cranes, a dump truck, street sweepers, a riding lawnmower, and six chainsaws. The equipment was used to help remove debris and fishing boats from downtown.

==Shipbuilding==
Bayou La Batre is a center for shipbuilding. The shipyards are owned and operated mainly by local families such as Gazzier Marine Services, Metal Shark (formerly Horizon Shipbuilding), Steiner Ship Yard, Rodriguez Boat Builders, Master Boat Builders, Williams Fabrication, and Landry Boat Works.

People from all over the world including the United States, South America, and Africa have boats built in Bayou La Batre frequently. In 2005, Steiner Ship Yard was asked by Walt Disney Studios to build a pirate ship, the Black Pearl; the pitch-black ship was actually a huge wooden prop built on top of a modern 96-foot-long steel utility boat. Crews sailed the ship out of the bayou to the Caribbean for the filming of sequels to Disney&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;.

Another ship, the FV &quot;Cornelia Marie&quot; from the Deadliest Catch series, was built in Bayou La Batre in 1989.

The large Asian population is attributable to a large influx of Vietnamese American shrimpers as immigrants following the Vietnam War as well as Cambodian and Laotian refugees and their children. Bayou la Batre was a popular destination for such immigrants because it fostered and continues to foster a similar shrimping industry to that of Vietnam.

The per capita income for the city was $9,928. About 22.9% of families and 28.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 35.9% of those under age 18 and 17.7% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
Bayou La Batre is served by the Mobile County Public School System. The city includes Booth (formerly Alba) Elementary School, Alba Middle School, and Alma Bryant High School, where all the high school students attend. Additionally, a small number of city residents&#x27; children attend Dixon Elementary in Irvington.

Both Alma Bryant and Booth Elementary are located on the northernmost edge of the city. Bryant, built in 1998, slightly delayed by Hurricane Georges, and Booth, built in 2006, delayed by Hurricane Katrina, are located on Hurricane Boulevard. Both schools&#x27; students were (in part) located in what is now Alba Middle School further south in Bayou La Batre. Alba High School first combined with Grand Bay High School in 1998 in the newly built, centrally located Alma Bryant High School, located on 16th Section land (land dedicated for school purposes). Alba Middle (which was in great part located in portable classrooms and was a part of the high School campus, as was Grand Bay Middle) took over the high school building, greatly relieving overcrowding. Similarly, the Alba Elementary Campus which shared land with the middle school, while being mostly autonomous, also became part of Alba Middle School. Alba and Grand Bay Middle are the focal point of bus routes for all school buses for Bryant High, those buses shared in grades 6-12 as a cost-saving effort to avoid overlapping routes for the separate schools.

In December 2007, a new library was opened to serve the area&#x27;s Asian-American community. The library is located on Wintzell Avenue in the Bayou La Batre office of Boat People SOS, a national group that assists Vietnamese-Americans. The Mobile County Commission gave $2,500. The library will be used as a place where elderly immigrants can master computer skills, children can practice their Vietnamese after school, and day laborers can surf the Web after work.

==Film and book references==
Bayou La Batre is mentioned in the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and in Winston Groom&#x27;s book of the same name on which the movie is based as the home of Forrest&#x27;s army buddy Benjamin Buford &quot;Bubba&quot; Blue, and later as the home of Forrest Gump himself during his time as a shrimp boat captain. Shrimping scenes in the film were filmed in the Lowcountry region of South Carolina, primarily in the communities of Beaufort and Port Royal.

In April 2005, Disney Studios launched a secretly built pirate ship, the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, out of Bayou La Batre for filming sequels to &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. Bayou La Batre&#x27;s seafood industry also serves as a centerpiece for the History channel&#x27;s reality documentary series &quot;Big Shrimpin&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Chickasaw is a city in Mobile County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2020 census the population was 6,457, up from 6,106 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Mobile metropolitan area.

== History ==
=== Company town ===

In the early 20th century before the city now standing was incorporated, the present site of Chickasaw was a company town, wholly owned by Chickasaw Shipyard and developed for its workers. The property was bought by Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation in 1940. It expanded with the defense buildup during World War II.

It attempted to restrict the activities of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, the subject of a case that reached the Supreme Court of the United States, &quot;Marsh v. Alabama&quot;, 326 U.S. 501 (1946). The court ruled that although the Chickasaw Shipyard Village was privately owned, because it functioned as a town open to the public, the right conferred on residents and visitors by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution cannot be abridged.

In 1946 the village was purchased by Leedy Investment Company. It renovated housing and offered it for sale to renters. Some former residents returned to the village and bought houses. It suffered from downturns in shipbuilding, which caused the loss of jobs.

Residents worked to have the village documented, and in 2004 the Chickasaw Shipyard Village Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

== Education ==
Chickasaw&#x27;s public schools are within the Chickasaw City Schools district. The city voted in 2012 to form its own school system with Satsuma, Alabama, leaving that operated by Mobile County School Board.

===History of schools===
Chickasaw&#x27;s public schools were previously operated by the Mobile County Public School System. Hamilton Elementary School was within the Chickasaw city limits and serves Chickasaw residents. In addition two magnet schools, the elementary Chickasaw School of Mathematics and Science and the Clark School of Mathematics, Science and Technology (high school), were in the city. Residents zoned to Hamilton are also zoned to Chastang Middle School.

Several years prior to 2009, officials of Chickasaw, Satsuma, and Saraland contemplated forming the &quot;Delta School District.&quot; Around 2009 Chickasaw officials considered a plan to secede from the Mobile County school system, after Mobile County officials considered closing the Chickasaw magnets, which together have a combined total of 14% Chickasaw residents. The remainder of the students came from other locations, including the unincorporated area of Grand Bay. Mobile County considered moving the magnets to Shaw High School in western Mobile.

Chickasaw did separate from the Mobile County school system, effective in 2013, with the understanding that the elementary Chickasaw School of Mathematics and Science would be relocated from Chickasaw within four years. While it remained, the residents of Chickasaw were required to pay $2,200 per year per child in order to attend the school, as they were no longer part of the county system. In January 2013 the Mobile County school board decided to move the elementary Mathematics and Science school to the former Howard Elementary School near Downtown Mobile.

<text>Citronelle is a city on the northern border of Mobile County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 3,946. It is included in the Mobile metropolitan statistical area and is about north of Mobile.

==History==
The area was inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. By the time of European contact, the historic Choctaw and Creek people hunted in the area.

The first known European explorers of this area were French in the 18th century. They learned that the land had healing herbs and mineral springs. The area was settled in 1811 and established as a jurisdiction (incorporated) in 1892. The name &quot;Citronelle&quot; is French and is derived from the citronella plant. In the late 19th century, the town became a popular resort destination because of the climate, herbs, and healing waters. Many hotels were built to accommodate the surge of visitors.

On May 4, 1865, one of the last significant Confederate armies was surrendered by Lieutenant General Richard Taylor under the &quot;Surrender Oak&quot;. This was the third in the series of five major surrenders of armies that ended the war. The two previous surrenders occurred at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, between Confederate General Robert E. Lee and US General Ulysses S. Grant; and the second and largest at Bennett Place near Durham, North Carolina between US General William T. Sherman and Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston.

A living history/reenactment of the surrender occurs each year in Citronelle. The historic &quot;Surrender Oak&quot; no longer stands, as it was destroyed by a hurricane in 1902.

In 1955, oil was discovered in the area. Today Citronelle is known as the oil capital of Alabama.

==Geology==
Citronelle developed on what is known as the Citronelle Dome, a salt dome formation that is still rising, as shown by the radial drainage of streams away from the center. In 1955 oil was discovered in this geologic structure at a greater depth than had previously been considered as feasible. The Citronelle Dome was developed as among the first of many &quot;deep&quot; oil fields. The discovery well yielded oil from the Glen Rose Formation at a depth of .

&quot;Citronelle Dome is a giant salt-cored anticline in the eastern Mississippi Interior Salt Basin of southwest Alabama. The dome forms an elliptical structural closure containing multiple opportunities for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and saline reservoir CO2 sequestration. Citronelle Oil Field, located on the crest of the dome, has produced more than of 42-46° American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity oil from the Lower Cretaceous Donovan Sand.&quot;

==Education==
Mobile County Public School System operates public schools. Students are zoned to North Mobile County K-8 School, previously North Mobile County Middle School, near Axis CDP. Creola students go to Citronelle High School in Citronelle.

===History of schools===
On September 7, 2010, North Mobile County Middle School opened, replacing the role of Adams Middle School in Saraland, because residents outside of Saraland are no longer zoned to Adams Middle. This rezoning affected residents in Creola, who were newly assigned to North Mobile County.

Prior to the 2012 split of the City of Satsuma from the Mobile County system, Creola was zoned to Satsuma schools, including Satsuma High School. In 2011 Renee Busbee of the &quot;Mobile Press-Register&quot; said that residents of Creola may be rezoned to Blount, Citronelle, and/or Vigor high schools.

Ultimately Creola, without an elementary school after the departure of Satsuma schools, was rezoned to North Mobile County, converted into a K-8, and Citronelle High. Any Creola residents wishing to send their children to Satsuma schools would be required to pay tuition. about 100 students residing in Creola attended Satsuma schools.

Due to the distance to Citronelle High (the distance by bus is about 30 minutes), several area parents wanted an annexation to the City of Satsuma and/or a partnership with the Satsuma school system. In 2013 a member of the Creola city council, Tonya Moss, stated that the city has &quot;a bond with Satsuma&quot; and that most of the council&#x27;s members had graduated from Satsuma High. By 2013 there were discussions regarding a possible educational partnership between representatives of the two cities, in which the Creola city government would pay the City of Satsuma instead of Mobile County to educate its children.

<text>Dauphin Island, formerly Massacre Island (French: &quot;Île du Massacre&quot;) is an island town in Mobile County, Alabama, United States, on a barrier island of the same name, in the Gulf of Mexico. It incorporated in 1988. The population was 1,778 at the 2020 census, up from 1,238 at the 2010 census. The town is part of the Mobile metropolitan area. The island (originally named Massacre Island) was renamed for Louis XIV of France&#x27;s great-grandson and heir, the dauphin, the future Louis XV of France. The name of the island is often mistaken as Dolphin Island; the word &quot;dauphin&quot; is French for dolphin, but historically, the term was used as the title of the heir apparent to the French monarch.

The island is one of the Mississippi–Alabama barrier islands, with the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and the Mississippi Sound and Mobile Bay to the north. The island&#x27;s eastern end helps define the mouth of Mobile Bay. The eastern, wider portion of the island is shaded by thick stands of pine trees and saw palmettos, but the narrow, western part of the island features scrub growth and few trees.

Dauphin Island is home to Fort Gaines, Dauphin Island Sea Lab, the Estuarium public aquarium, the Dauphin Island Airport, boat ramps, a large public pier that sits on dry land, historic sites, several restaurants, new condominium developments, and numerous private homes. Beaches attract tourism, and fishing is a popular activity in the waters around the island. The island is connected to the mainland by the Gordon Persons Bridge.

Although the island has several bird sanctuaries, the main one is the Audubon Bird Sanctuary. Because Dauphin Island is the first land encountered by many birds as they migrate north from South America, many species can be found resting there before continuing their journey.

In May 2012, the central public beach began charging for access. This marked the second beach on the island to charge the public following the creation of the privately owned West End Beach.

==History==
Serpentine shell middens, perhaps 1,500 years old, attest to at least seasonal occupation by the Native American Mississippian Mound Builder culture. Shell Mound Park, along the island&#x27;s northern shore, is administered by the Alabama Marine Resources Division.
In 1519, the Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda was the first documented European to visit, staying long enough to map the island with remarkable accuracy.

The island&#x27;s French history began on January 31, 1699, when the explorer Pierre Le Moyne, sieur d&#x27;Iberville, one of the founders of French Louisiana, arrived at Mobile Bay and anchored near the island on his way to explore the mouth of the Mississippi River. D&#x27;Iberville mistakenly named it &quot;Île du Massacre&quot; (Massacre Island) because of a large pile of human skeletons discovered there. In reality, the site was a Mississippian burial mound which had been broken open by a hurricane, not a massacre site; however, the dramatic misnomer stuck.

D&#x27;Iberville later established a port for Fort Louis de La Louisiane on the island due to its abundant timber, reliable supply of fresh water, and deep-water harbor. The settlement consisted of a fort, a chapel, government-owned warehouses, and residences.
The island served as a major trading depot where goods from Saint-Domingue (Haiti), Mexico, Cuba and France were unloaded and a short-lived fur trade was conducted. Before a channel was dredged, Mobile Bay was too shallow and its sandbars too treacherous for ocean-going vessels to travel up the bay and Mobile River to Fort Louis de La Louisiane. Thus, smaller boats carried the cargo within Mobile Bay to and from Dauphin Island.

In 1719 the first African slaves of Alabama arrived at Dauphin Island. After the French and Indian War (known in Europe as the Seven Years&#x27; War) ended in 1763, the island was ceded to the British. After the American Revolutionary War, the territory again came under Spanish jurisdiction, being part of the Province of West Florida until 1812.

In 1795 after the Treaty of San Lorenzo was signed between Spain and the United States, new settlers began migrating to Alabama from Virginia, North &amp; South Carolina and Georgia.

In 1805, the Chickasaw, Cherokee and Choctaw people were forced to cede their lands to the government. The Creek tribes aggressively fought to hold their lands, but eventually were forced to cede in 1813.

Fort Gaines on the eastern tip of the island was built between 1821 and 1848. It was occupied by Confederate forces in 1861 and captured by the Union Army during the Battle of Mobile Bay. The phrase, &quot;Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead,&quot; was supposedly spoken by U. S. Admiral David Farragut just a few hundred yards from Dauphin Island&#x27;s shore.
The first Sand Island Light, authorized in 1834, was replaced by a structure high, at a cost of $35,000, that was destroyed by Confederate forces. The present lighthouse (1873; in use until 1970), has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its ownership was recently transferred from the U.S. Department of Interior to the town of Dauphin Island.

In 2023, a large alligator was spotted riding waves and sunbathing on the beach of Dauphin Island. Onlookers posted photos of the alligator to social media, which subsequently went viral. While alligators traditionally live in freshwater, they are able to tolerate salt water as well according to the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.

==Geography==
Dauphin Island is long from east to west, separating the Gulf of Mexico to the south from the Mississippi Sound and Mobile Bay to the north. The island is less than wide for most of its length, except for the eastern quarter of the island, which is over wide. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the island has a land area of , while the town&#x27;s total area is much greater: , with of it, or 96.2% of the town, in the water of the surrounding Gulf and bays.

The Dauphin Island Bridge, officially the Gordon Persons Bridge, is the island&#x27;s sole road connection to the Alabama mainland, carrying State Route 193, which leads north to Tillmans Corner in the southwest outskirts of Mobile. Downtown Mobile is north of the island.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Dauphin Island has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

The town is served by the Mobile County Public School System. It has one public school, Dauphin Island Elementary School. Middle school students go on to Alba Middle School in Bayou La Batre and Alma Bryant High School in Bayou La Batre.

The Dauphin Island Sea Lab is located on the east end of the island on grounds formerly occupied by the 693rd Radar Squadron, Dauphin Island Air Force Station, US Air Force, and is home to the Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium.

==Coat of arms==
At the top of Dauphin Island&#x27;s coat of arms is the historic Fort Gaines with two cannons facing north and south, which represent Dauphin Island&#x27;s role during the Civil War. The boat is a shrimping vessel which represents the livelihood of many of the residents of the island. The dolphin is a mammal seen quite often in the Gulf of Mexico and Mobile Bay waters surrounding the island. The birds are pelicans, which are numerous around the island and the entire Gulf coast. The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; represents the presence of France on the island from 1699 to 1764. The sailing ship is a Spanish galleon to represent Spain&#x27;s role in settling the area between 1781 and 1813.

== Hurricanes ==
Over the centuries, many hurricanes have struck the island. Some recent storms include:
* In 1969, Hurricane Camille flooded 70% of the island and was the worst storm to strike the area until Hurricane Frederic.
* In 1979, Hurricane Frederic (September 12) destroyed the bridge to the mainland, which had been opened in 1955.
* In 1985, Hurricane Elena brought wind gusts of over to the island.
* In 1997, Hurricane Danny caused extensive flooding on the east end of the island.
* In 1998, Hurricane Georges destroyed 41 houses on the island.
* In 2004, Hurricane Ivan caused nearly one-fourth of the island to be covered with approximately two feet of water.
* On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina brought damage to parts of Dauphin Island. Some homes on the west end of the island were destroyed, and the Katrina Cut was formed as a channel splitting off the western part. However, most areas of the central and east end of the island experienced little flooding from the storm surge. The approach road to the island fared better than expected. The damage to most East End beachfront homes was limited to decks, stairs and storage buildings. In DeSoto Landing, a gated Gulf-front subdivision on Dauphin Island, the main homes had no water entering the homes unless a window or roof system failed; many avoided surge waters entirely. Damage was limited due to Sand Island (Pelican Island), a large sandbar south of DeSoto Landing which broke the force of battering waves. An oil drilling platform grounded near the island as the hurricane passed by. It was identified by its owners, Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., as the Ocean Warwick, pushed nearly from its original location by the hurricane.
* On September 14, 2020, storm surge from offshore Hurricane Sally flooded the island.

==Tourist attractions==
The old walled Fort Gaines is on the east end of Dauphin Island. A ferry from nearby Fort Morgan in Gulf Shores brings both vehicles and pedestrians to the island. One of the closest attractions to the ferry dock is The Estuarium, a fresh- and saltwater aquarium highlighting species native to Alabama.

The Dauphin Island Heritage and Arts Council features works by local artists, as well as information on the history of Dauphin Island. It organizes the annual Dauphin Island Native American Festival.

<text>Grand Bay is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Mobile County, Alabama, United States. It is part of the Mobile metropolitan area. The population was 3,460 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

According to local accounts, George Cassibry was the first white person to settle in Grand Bay. He came to the area in 1853, establishing a home site near the headwaters of Franklin Creek located today near the intersection of Highway 90 and Ramsey Road. Exploration and settlement of the area was well underway by the mid-nineteenth century.

During the Civil War, the town saw brief military action as a column of troops under U.S. General Gordon Granger reached the town as a preliminary move in the siege of Mobile. In 1870 the U.S. Postal Service established a post office at a location near the center of the current community.

Settlement began in earnest when the Grand Bay Land Company began offering ten-acre lots for sale in the early 1900s. The lots were marketed to people living in and around Chicago and other northern cities as a way to live self-sufficiently in a mild climate. Supposedly, ten acres planted in pecan and satsuma trees would be enough to supply the needs of anyone. The timber industry also attracted many to the area. Much of the region south of Grand Bay to the coast along the Mississippi Sound was clearcut.

For a time, the town flourished. A weekly newspaper was published there, and telegraph service was offered to the region through an operator at Grand Bay. The town had a number of businesses including a hotel, drug store, several general merchandise stores and a bank. However, hurricanes in 1906 and 1910, along with a severe freeze, sent many scurrying back north. Their efforts, however, have not gone unnoticed even today. Cogon grass, a highly-invasive rhizome, first introduced to the area as packing material in satsuma trees imported from Asia, has now become a serious Southeastern agricultural problem.

In 1993, the old Grand Bay State Bank building became the temporary site of the El Cazador Museum, and held treasure from the &quot;El Cazador&quot;. The area in and around the old bank building now forms the Grand Bay Historic District and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Grand Bay is located in southwestern Mobile County at (30.474055, -88.341836), along U.S. Route 90, a few miles inland from the Mississippi Sound.

The Mobile County Sheriff&#x27;s Department maintains a satellite office in Grand Bay as well. Grand Bay Water Works also provides limited sewer service for Breitling Elementary School and the business district around the Interstate 10 exchange.

== Watermelon Festival ==
A July 4 tradition since 1973, the current version of the Grand Bay Watermelon Festival offers tourists and locals an opportunity to sample locally grown watermelon while enjoying local music, arts &amp; crafts, and informative displays from area merchants and service providers.

The annual celebration has a long and storied history, having begun during the earliest years of the 20th Century. As the community and surrounding area changed during World War II, the annual celebration was discontinued. It was revived in 1973 by the Grand Bay Junior Chamber of Commerce. Currently, it is sponsored by the Grand Bay Independent Order of Odd Fellows #73. It is currently held at the Odd Fellows Festival Park and local baseball park just north of U.S. Highway 90 on the west side of Grand Bay. It begins on July 3 from 3-7 p.m. and continues on July 4 from 10 a.m. and concludes at 6 p.m. There is also a fantastic fireworks show that starts at dusk (about 8:15 p.m.) The website for the Grand Bay Watermelon Festival is: www.grandbaywatermelonfestival.org.

== Pecans and fruit==

Much of the rural land around Grand Bay is planted in pecan trees, another reminder of the Grand Bay Land Company days. Many of the pecan orchards have been converted from agricultural production for use as residential home sites. However, pecan production is still an important business and provides supplemental income to residents who work in nonagricultural jobs.

In addition, the area has become home to a large peach business and satsumas, once destroyed by freezing temperatures, have now returned to commercial production in a more weather-hardy variety.

Grand Bay watermelons, however, remain the produce most identified with the community.

==Community center==
The Grand Bay-St. Elmo Community Center is a multi-use facility located on the east side of Grand Bay at 11610 Highway 90. The building is near the intersection of Highway 90 and Ramsay Road Extension. Constructed in 2005, the center operates on a non-profit basis. Facilities are available for rent to the public. The Center is located on the site of the former Grand Bay Elementary School for Colored, a racially segregated elementary school established in 1919.

==Economy==
The business section of Grand Bay stretches east to west along Highway 90 for about two miles from Festival Park Road on the west side to Highway 188 on the east, and north to south along Grand Bay Wilmer Road from Highway 90 to Old Pascagoula Road. Recent development has centered on two areas, primarily at the intersection of Grand Bay-Wilmer Road and US 90, and at the intersection of Grand Bay-Wilmer Road and Interstate 10.

==Education==
Mobile County Public Schools operates area public schools. Some residents are zoned to Breitling Elementary School while others are zoned to Cora Castlen Elementary School. All residents are zoned to Grand Bay Middle School and Alma Bryant High School in Irvington.

<text>Man on the Moon is a 1999 biographical comedy drama film about American entertainer Andy Kaufman, starring Jim Carrey as Kaufman. The film was directed by Miloš Forman and also features Danny DeVito, Courtney Love and Paul Giamatti.

The story traces Kaufman&#x27;s steps from childhood through the comedy clubs and television appearances that made him famous, including his memorable appearances on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Fridays&quot; and his role as Latka Gravas on the sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot;, which was popular among viewers but disruptive for Kaufman&#x27;s co-stars (DeVito, who also co-produced the film, co-starred with the real Kaufman on the series). The film pays particular attention to the various inside jokes, scams, put-ons, and happenings for which Kaufman was famous, most significantly his long-running &quot;feud&quot; with wrestler Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler and his portrayal of the character of bawdy lounge singer Tony Clifton.

It was released on December 22, 1999, in the United States and May 5, 2000, in the United Kingdom by Universal Pictures and by Warner Bros. Pictures in some markets. Although the film was commercially unsuccessful and received mixed reviews, Carrey received critical acclaim for his performance and won a Golden Globe, his second in a row after his award for &quot;The Truman Show&quot;. His win was in the Musical or Comedy category.

The documentary &quot;Jim &amp; Andy: The Great Beyond&quot; was released in 2017 and chronicles Carrey&#x27;s performance as Kaufman in the film, a performance he maintained during much of the film&#x27;s production.

Though Carrey received praise for his performance, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; ended his starring role run of eight consecutive films that averaged around $240 million each in box office grosses — one of the most successful stretches in motion picture history.

==Plot==
Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings the Mighty Mouse theme song and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no talent, his previously timid &quot;foreign man&quot; character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into thunderous applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them.

Soon after fooling the audience in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Kaufman catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs him as a client and lands him a television series, &quot;Taxi&quot;, much to Kaufman&#x27;s dismay, as he does not like sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly, he hates doing the show and wants to quit.

Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by lounge singer Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on &quot;Taxi&quot;. Backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a &quot;villain character&quot; created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience.

Kaufman&#x27;s profile increases with appearances on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his unusual anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the &quot;Taxi&quot; set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the set. He relates to Shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience &quot;short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire.&quot;

Kaufman decides to become a professional wrestler — but to emphasize the &quot;villain&quot; angle, he will wrestle only women (hired actresses) and then berate them after winning, declaring himself &quot;Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion.&quot; He becomes smitten with one woman he wrestles, Lynne Margulies, and they start dating. His professional issues are deepened when, during an appearance on ABC&#x27;s live television comedy show &quot;Fridays&quot;, Kaufman refuses to speak his lines.

Kaufman feuds publicly with Jerry Lawler, a professional wrestler who challenges him to a &quot;real wrestling match&quot;, which Kaufman accepts. Lawler overpowers and appears to seriously injure Kaufman. Lawler and an injured Kaufman (wearing a neck brace) appear on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, ostensibly to call a truce, but instead, the feud escalates and they trade insults before getting into another fight. Kaufman pays the price when he is kicked off &quot;SNL&quot; following a vote by audience members, weary and bored of his wrestling antics. Shapiro advises Kaufman and Lawler, who are actually best friends and have staged their feud as a joke, that he thinks they should never work together again. Shapiro later calls Kaufman to inform him that &quot;Taxi&quot; has been canceled, though Kaufman is not at all bothered.

After performing at a comedy club, Kaufman calls Lynne, Zmuda, and Shapiro to disclose that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer and may die soon. Initially, they are not sure whether to believe this, thinking it could be another Kaufman stunt, with Zmuda actually believing a fake death would be a fantastic prank. With little time to live, Kaufman arranges a booking at Carnegie Hall, his dream venue. The performance is a success, culminating with Kaufman inviting the entire audience out for milk and cookies. As his health deteriorates, a desperate Kaufman heads to the Philippines to seek a medical miracle through psychic surgery, only to find it a hoax, laughing at the irony. He dies soon after. At Kaufman&#x27;s funeral, his loved ones sing along to &quot;This Friendly World&quot; with a video of Kaufman.

One year later, in 1985, Tony Clifton appears at Kaufman&#x27;s tribute at The Comedy Store&#x27;s main stage, performing &quot;I Will Survive&quot;, while Zmuda (who would often perform as Clifton in routines where Kaufman appeared as himself) watches in the audience.

Several members of the cast of &quot;Taxi&quot;, including Marilu Henner, Judd Hirsch, Christopher Lloyd, Carol Kane, and Jeff Conaway make cameos, playing themselves. Danny DeVito, who was also in the cast of &quot;Taxi&quot;, co-starred in the film but did not appear as himself.

Many of Kaufman&#x27;s other real-life friends and co-stars also appear in the film (although not all as themselves), including Zmuda, Shapiro, Margulies, David Letterman, Paul Shaffer, professional wrestler Jerry Lawler, wrestling announcers Jim Ross and Lance Russell, &quot;The Improv&quot; founder Budd Friedman, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; creator Lorne Michaels, and actors Vincent Schiavelli and Chad Whitson. Michael Richards is played by Norm Macdonald in a recreation of the &quot;Fridays&quot; show skit. According to Jerry Lawler&#x27;s autobiography &quot;It&#x27;s Good to be the King ... sometimes&quot;, WCW wrestler Glenn Gilbertti, better known to wrestling fans as Disco Inferno, was considered for the role of Lawler.

Kevin Spacey, Edward Norton, Nicolas Cage, John Cusack and Hank Azaria auditioned for the role of Andy Kaufman.

==Production==
&quot;Man on the Moon&quot; was shot in Los Angeles in the winter of 1998. The film&#x27;s production is notable for Carrey&#x27;s rigid method acting, staying in-character as Kaufman both on and off the set for the duration of production. Carrey&#x27;s adherence to the role reached the extent where he would develop unscripted tics and habits that were previously characteristic of Kaufman himself. Among other examples, Courtney Love noted how Carrey would stuff his clothing with Limburger cheese on the set when playing Kaufman&#x27;s Tony Clifton character in the film, something Kaufman had done in his own performances of the character.

A documentary, &quot;Jim &amp; Andy: The Great Beyond&quot;, was released in November 2017. Using behind-the-scenes footage, the documentary covers the production of &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; with a particular focus on Carrey&#x27;s overwrought method-acting as Kaufman.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack for the film was written by rock band R.E.M., whose 1992 song &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; (originally written in honor of Kaufman) gave the film its title. The soundtrack also included the Grammy-nominated song &quot;The Great Beyond&quot;, which remains the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in the United Kingdom.

==Historical accuracy==
The film makes a few changes to Kaufman&#x27;s life story. As Kaufman (played by Carrey) explains in the film&#x27;s prologue, &quot;All the most important things in my life are changed around and mixed up for dramatic purposes.&quot;

The famous Carnegie Hall &quot;milk and cookies&quot; performance, portrayed in the film as one of his last performances after being diagnosed with cancer, had in fact occurred in 1979, five years before Kaufman&#x27;s death and well before his diagnosis. Also, the film is deliberately ambiguous over whether Kaufman actually died or if this was a hoax as some fans believe.

The film implies that Carol Kane was a member of the &quot;Taxi&quot; cast during the show&#x27;s first season, which in real life was 1978–79. In actuality, Kane did not make her first appearance on the series until the episode &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming for Brefnish&quot;, which first aired on ABC in January 1980 during the show&#x27;s second season. The film implies that &quot;Taxi&quot; was canceled only once. However, the show went on for one more season on NBC.

Other inaccuracies include scenes supposedly drawn from &quot;SNL&quot;, specifically the first episode&#x27;s host, who is depicted as having been Richard Belzer but was George Carlin in real life. Belzer also erroneously refers to the show as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during the sequence, but that title wasn&#x27;t adopted until season two. The Mighty Mouse segment also prolongs the &quot;dead air&quot; before the record starts playing (in reality he only paused a few seconds). The scene where Lorne Michaels asks the home viewing audience to vote Kaufman off the show happened in 1982, two years after Michaels left the show as executive producer and Dick Ebersol took over.

After its release, the film attracted some criticism over various events in Kaufman&#x27;s life that were left out. Max Allan Collins maintained that the filmmakers did not understand Kaufman, and that the film &quot;does not give Kaufman the credit for his genius, that he had a complete intellectual grasp of what he was up to and a showman&#x27;s instincts for how to play an audience.&quot; Significantly, these critics included Kaufman&#x27;s own father Stanley, who was displeased that little of Andy&#x27;s early life (before show business) and early career were portrayed.

Sam Simon, season 5 writer on &quot;Taxi&quot;, stated in a 2013 interview with Marc Maron for the &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot; podcast that the portrayal of Andy on the show was &quot;a complete fiction,&quot; that Kaufman was &quot;completely professional&quot; and that he &quot;told you Tony Clifton was him.&quot; Simon also stated that sources for these stories were mostly from Bob Zmuda and a &quot;little bit of press and hype,&quot; but conceded that Kaufman would have &quot;loved&quot; Zmuda&#x27;s version of events. As of 2020, occasional &quot;Taxi&quot; actress Carol Kane was the only &quot;Taxi&quot; cast member to have acknowledged attending his funeral.

==Reception==
 Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 58 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert, giving the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, wrote for the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot;: 

&quot;Man on the Moon&quot; ended a string of films starring Jim Carrey that had very successful opening weekends, and grossed just $47 million against a budget of $52 million. Although the film received mixed reviews from critics, they were near unanimous in their praise for Carrey&#x27;s portrayal of Andy Kaufman. Carrey won a Golden Globe for his performance, and the film was nominated for Best Musical or Comedy as well.

<doc id="104918" wikidata="Q79609" url="?curid=104918" title="Prichard, Alabama">
<text>Prichard is a city in Mobile County, Alabama, United States. The population was 19,322 at the 2020 census, and was estimated to be 18,816 in 2023. Prichard borders the north side of Mobile, as well as the Mobile suburbs of Chickasaw, Saraland, and the unincorporated sections of Eight Mile.

==History==
Prichard began as a settlement in the 1830s, bordering Telegraph Road (known now as U.S. Highway 43). It remained largely unsettled until after the American Civil War. The &quot;Clotilda&quot;, an illegal slave ship, had arrived at Mobile Bay in July 1860 carrying 110 Africans purchased in Ouidah, Kingdom of Dahomey, on behalf of Mobile shipbuilders and merchants. It was towed into the delta north of the city, burned, and sunk to escape capture. The Africans were taken upriver by a steamboat and landed near Magazine Point. They were distributed among the investors in the voyage.

After the war, some 32 of the Africans returned there, developing Africatown as their own community. The Plateau/Magazine area was developed along Telegraph Road. Eventually, Plateau and Magazine had their territory split between Mobile and Prichard. The Africatown Historic District, considered part of Mobile, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

After 1900, Prichard began a slow, steady development. Major industries related to shipbuilding and paper mills began to develop along the waterfront, and some workers settled in Prichard.

Social tensions were high in the postwar period as veterans returned and struggled to get jobs. The summer of 1919 became known as Red Summer because of the numerous racial riots that took place in industrial cities across the country, including Chicago, Omaha, Baltimore, and Washington, DC. On June 6, 1919, James Lewis was lynched in Prichard.

Prichard was incorporated on September 16, 1925. During World War II, the defense industry and shipbuilding expanded in Mobile, and Prichard became a company town. Many Mobile shipbuilding companies built homes for their workers in Prichard. The 1940s and 1950s saw phenomenal growth in the Mobile area, which accompanied expansion of the defense and shipbuilding industries during and after World War II. During the 1950s and 1960s, Prichard annexed historic Whistler as well as parts of Eight Mile and Kushla.

Mobile, Prichard and Chickasaw all recorded their highest city-proper populations in 1960. In the postwar period, federally subsidized highway construction made commuting from suburbs easier and encouraged suburban housing development across the country, including in the Mobile metropolitan area. Like other cities, Prichard began to see its middle-class residents move out to newer housing, because they could afford to do so. In addition, following the Civil Rights Movement and passage of civil rights laws in the mid-1960s, the state&#x27;s rigid system of Jim Crow and racial segregation was overturned. Blacks who had previously been restricted to the Bullshead/Neely/Trinity Gardens area of Prichard began moving into downtown, or East Prichard.

These two elements began to result in a population decline in the city. In 1960, Prichard recorded a population of 47,371. By 1970, the population had decreased to 41,000 and by 1990, to approximately 34,000. This was also a period of decline in shipbuilding and related industries and, with the loss of jobs, workers moved elsewhere.

In 1970, Vigor High School on Wilson Avenue, which had been Prichard&#x27;s white high school during segregation, was 70% white. By 1980, it was 80% black. Although most of Prichard&#x27;s remaining majority-white areas were in this district, many families had put their students into parochial or private schools. Before being moved to its current location on Lott Road in Eight Mile, Blount High School was originally located on Main Street in Prichard. Blount High School was a predominantly African American high school, established in August 1956.

In 1972, the majority-white city of Prichard elected its first black mayor, Algernon Johnson (A.J.) Cooper. He served two terms as Prichard&#x27;s mayor. Later he was appointed to the administration of President Bill Clinton. In 1968, Cooper had founded the Black American Law Students Association at New York University, where he earned his law degree. While Mayor Cooper was popular with both blacks and whites, he had numerous confrontations with the Prichard City Council during his tenure. 

In 1994, construction of Interstate 165 was completed, and it produced some economic benefits in East Prichard. The 1980s downtown office vacancy rate was near 80%. As of 2000, it was closer to 30%.

But the closing of factories operated by Scott Paper Company and International Paper in the 1980s and 1990s caused a major loss of jobs, greatly adding to the city&#x27;s problems. It struggled with poverty, unemployment, and associated crime and drug use. The loss of the paper companies and associated jobs devastated the area and the city struggled to recover. In 1999, the city declared bankruptcy.

In 2004, the Prichard Housing Authority began demolition of the Bessemer Avenue Housing Project in Bullshead. In November of that year, Mobile County voters narrowly (500 votes out of 100,000 cast on the issue) defeated a local amendment which would have allowed Prichard to set up a special trade zone. The measure passed by a two-thirds vote in Prichard, and passed by smaller margins in the cities of Mobile and Chickasaw, but was defeated by the rest of Mobile County.

From 2010 to 2012, the city was home to the Restoration Youth Academy, a so-called Christian camp that imposed anti-gay conversion therapy. It closed in 2012 due to unpaid rent.

The enterprise reopened in Mobile, as the Saving Youth Foundation and Solid Rock Ministries, and operated until being shut down in 2015. It was closed by officials after investigations of abuse of youths and discovery of appallingly harsh conditions at the camp. The three pastors who ran the place were prosecuted for child abuse; they were convicted and sentenced in February 2017 to 20 years in prison. The case generated national media attention.

===City pensions controversy===
In 2003, the city hired an actuary to analyze and summarize their employees’ pension plan. He warned the city that at the current rate of government spending the plan would run out of money by the summer of 2009. In September of that year, the city&#x27;s pension fund ran out of money and stopped paying pensions.
The city filed for bankruptcy again in October 2009.

In 2010, Councilwoman Earline Martin-Harris suggested dissolving the city and offered an alternative budget which would make all city employees part-time employees. As of April 2011, pensioners had not received their pension checks nor had a budget been passed in eighteen months.

The dispute continued into 2013, as the city did not reach an agreement with soon-to-retire employees. In response to these developments, four of these employees requested that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William Shulman dismiss the city&#x27;s bankruptcy.

<text>Saraland is a city in Mobile County, Alabama, United States, and a suburb of Mobile. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 16,171, up from 13,405 at the 2010 census. Saraland, part of the Mobile metropolitan area, is the third largest city in Mobile County.

==Geography==
Saraland is located at (30.825186, -88.091932). It is bordered to the southwest by the city of Prichard, to the south by Chickasaw, to the east by the undeveloped northern end of Mobile, and to the northeast by Satsuma and Creola.

U.S. Route 43 (Saraland Boulevard) and Interstate 65 are the main north–south routes through Saraland. U.S. 43 leads south to downtown Mobile and north to Jackson, while I-65 leads south to its terminus at Interstate 10 in southwestern Mobile, and northeast to Montgomery, the state capital.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Saraland has a total area of , of which , or 0.68%, are water. The city is drained by Bayou Sara, an east-flowing tributary of the Mobile River.

== History ==
The land area that was to become the present-day Saraland was included in a Spanish land grant to Don Diego Alvarez. Hence, descendants of Alvarez were the ones to give the community its first name: Alvarez Station. Later land squatters moved into the area and were able, legally, in 1800 to begin purchasing property. In 1807, a land office was opened in St. Stephens to handle all land transactions. Some of the pioneer families who seized the opportunity to buy up sections were named Alvarez, Rice, Hartley, Moore, LaCoste, Williams, Tool and Cleveland. Eventually, Alvarez Station was called Cleveland Station. The present name of the city is reported to have been given by C.J. DeWitt, a retired minister editor who moved south in 1890 for health reasons. He opened the first post office on the Southern Railroad in 1895. The community is purported to be the namesake of his beloved wife, Sara.

Saraland was sparsely populated during the first part of the 20th century, until an industrial and population boom occurred in neighboring Mobile. Northward expansion of Mobile in the 1940s and 50s brought about the incorporation of Saraland in 1957. At the time of incorporation, the city reported only 125 residents. By the 1960 U.S. Census, annexations had swelled the population to 4,595. In 1980, census figures cited 9,844 Saraland residents. As of the 2020 census, Saraland&#x27;s population had grown to 16,171.

The worst rail disaster in the history of Amtrak occurred just east of Saraland on Big Bayou Canot on September 22, 1993. At approximately 2:53 AM, Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; train, powered by three locomotives, and en route from Los Angeles to Miami with 220 passengers and crew aboard, crossed the Bayou Canot bridge at high speed and derailed at a kink in the track caused by a barge captain who rammed the bridge by making a wrong turn in the waterway and failed to report the accident. 47 people, of whom 42 were passengers, were killed, many by drowning, others by fire. Much of the rescue efforts were average citizens of the community who journeyed out in the early morning hours in small fishing boats to help at the scene.

Saraland is served by the Saraland Board of Education. Residents are zoned to Saraland Early Education Center, Saraland Elementary School, Saraland (formerly Adams) Middle School, and Saraland High School.

In June 2006, the City of Saraland voted to break away from the Mobile County Public School System and form its own school system. The school district came into effect in autumn 2008; at the time Saraland Elementary and Adams Middle were a part of the city district, but high schoolers had to attend county schools because Saraland High School was not yet open. Prior to the split of the City of Saraland from the county system in 2009, Saraland was zoned to Satsuma High School. 2011 was the final year in which Saraland residents were permitted by the county to attend county schools.

Several years prior to 2009 officials of Saraland, Satsuma, and Chickasaw contemplated forming the &quot;Delta School District.&quot;

==Education==
Satsuma is served by the Satsuma City School System, following the successful separation from the Mobile County Public School System in 2012.

Satsuma voted on April 12, 2011, to create its own school system. The Satsuma City School System is served by two schools, Robert E. Lee Elementary (K-6) and Satsuma High School (7-12).

===Before separation from Mobile===
Before the Satsuma City School System was founded, the schools that served Satsuma included Robert E. Lee Primary School (Kindergarten through 2), Robert E. Lee Intermediate School (3 through 5), North Mobile County Middle School (6-8), Satsuma High School (9-12). Lee Primary, Lee Intermediate, and Satsuma High were in the city of Satsuma, while North Mobile County Middle was in Axis.

Before the Saraland City Schools system formed, Satsuma residents attended Adams Middle School in Saraland. In 2003, officials of Satsuma, Saraland, and Chickasaw contemplated forming the &quot;Delta School District.&quot; Such a split would have required an act from the Alabama Legislature. In June 2006, the City of Saraland voted to break away from the Mobile County Public School System and form its own school system. On September 7, 2010 North Mobile County Middle School opened, replacing the role of Adams Middle School in Saraland, because residents outside of Saraland are no longer zoned to Adams Middle.

Satsuma residents considered leaving Mobile County schools since circa 2001. In 2010, the City of Satsuma began conducting a study on whether it can split from the Mobile County school system. Tom Williams, a council member of Satsuma, said he began considering splitting once Mobile County decided to situate the new middle school in Axis, from Satsuma, since students have longer bus rides to the school and that the school is further away from fire and police stations. The Mobile County government built the school outside of the Satsuma city limits so the city government would be unable to possess the school if it opted to secede.

==History==
What would become Frisco City started out as two mid-19th century communities named Lufkin and Snider. It initially incorporated as the town of Jones Mill in 1909. It was named for the owner of the local grist mill. Four years later on November 4, 1913, the town was renamed as Roy for Roy Megargel, owner of the Gulf, Florida, and Alabama Railroad (GFA). The renaming was done on the condition that &quot;Roy&quot; would receive a rail line to the Town.

When Megargel failed to deliver on his promise, the town reverted to its name of Jones Mill in 1919 (also referred to as Jones Mills plural). Megargel failed to keep his name on Jones Mill, but later received a community named for him, that of Megargel, a census-designated place .

In 1925, the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad bought the GFA Railroad and agreed to complete what Megargel was not able to. In 1928, the line was completed, and in gratitude, the town formally renamed itself as Frisco City (taken from San Francisco).

Her other novel, &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot;, is also set in Maycomb. Truman Capote, best known for his novella &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; and his non-fiction novel &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, spent part of his childhood in Monroeville. Lee and Capote were neighbors and remained close friends into adulthood. Capote&#x27;s early novels, including &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; and &quot;The Grass Harp&quot;, draw heavily on his childhood in Monroeville. Capote has acknowledged being the inspiration for the character of Dill in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, while Lee in turn was the inspiration for the character of Idabel in &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot;.

<doc id="104932" wikidata="Q446586" url="?curid=104932" title="Brandon Boyd">
<text>Brandon Charles Boyd (born February 15, 1976) is an American musician, best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Incubus, with whom he has recorded eight studio albums.

In addition to his work with Incubus, Boyd has released two solo albums – &quot;The Wild Trapeze&quot; (2010) and &quot;Echoes &amp; Cocoons&quot; (2022) – and has collaborated with producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien under the name Sons of the Sea.

==Early life==
Boyd graduated from Calabasas High School in 1994 and attended Moorpark College for two years before committing to Incubus. Boyd grew up in Calabasas, California with Ricky Taylor who inspired him to write music. His parents, Priscilla &quot;Dolly&quot; Wiseman and Charles Boyd, both of whom had experience in entertainment, with his father being a former Marlboro Man, had nurtured his artistic side since he was a child. 

Boyd broke his nose twice; once getting an Easter egg to the face, and the other from being hit in the face with Dirk Lance&#x27;s bass during a show. He opted to let the injuries heal on their own, but they only worsened his breathing the older he became. He claims to have sung and breathed from one nostril up until having surgery to fix the issue in December 2019.

== Career ==

=== Incubus ===
Boyd designed concert fliers that advertised Incubus&#x27; early performances. He occasionally plays guitar during live performances and brings other instruments into his songs, such as the didgeridoo and djembe.

Boyd&#x27;s voice was part of what enticed Sony&#x27;s Epic/Immortal Records, along with the self-released album &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot;. The band was signed in 1996. Boyd&#x27;s singing style in Incubus has often been compared to Mike Patton, vocalist of Faith No More and several other projects. Boyd has mentioned Patton as being an influence since he was an early teenager. Incubus&#x27; first two releases on the label, &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; and &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; went largely unnoticed in the mainstream but subsequent releases &quot;Make Yourself&quot; and &quot;Morning View&quot; were commercial successes. Boyd attracted a large number of female fans. In a 2001 interview, &quot;Spin&quot; wrote &quot;Considering his androgynous beauty and sweet demeanor, plus Incubus&#x27; kid-tested/mother-approved guitar rock, it&#x27;s no surprise he&#x27;s MTV&#x27;s newest weapon of mass heartbreak. Girls scream for him to take his shirt off at Incubus shows (he usually obliges) and &quot;Teen People&quot; voted him one of &#x27;The Hottest Guys in Music.&#x27; His sensitive-guy appeal sets him apart from today&#x27;s testosterone-drunk rock&quot;. The band&#x27;s 2004 release &quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in the 2005 Grammy Awards. On November 28, 2006, the band released &quot;Light Grenades&quot;. In June 2009, Incubus released a greatest hits album, &quot;Monuments and Melodies&quot;.

In 2011, Incubus finished their seventh studio album &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot;, released on July 12, 2011, followed by a tour. It was their final release under Sony.

On December 13, 2014, they performed their single entitled &quot;Trust Fall&quot; at KROQ. They announced the release of two EPs in 2015 with the first, &quot;Trust Fall&quot;, released on March 24, 2015, through Island Records. On February 5, 2015, the single &quot;Absolution Calling&quot; was released. Two years later, in February 2017, Boyd and Incubus worked with Skrillex on a collaboration that was released under the title &quot;8&quot; in April 2017.

=== Literature and fine art ===
Boyd had been drawing his entire life. Between 2003 and 2008 he focused more on creating fine art, specifically painting. He participated in different group and solo art shows, using his artwork as a means for environmental activism. September 8, 2008, marked the opening of his first solo show, &quot;Ectoplasm&quot;, at Mr. Musichead Gallery in Los Angeles, California.

In March 2020, Boyd had planned to debut a new large-scale solo exhibit, &quot;Impossible Knots&quot;, at the Samuel Lynne Galleries in Dallas, Texas. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the in-person exhibit had to be postponed. On April 18, 2020, his work debuted online via a virtual exhibition preview on Instagram. This online debut will be followed by the in-person exhibition in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021.

Boyd released a card-matching game called &quot;Two Doors/Deux Portes&quot;, based on a series of his watercolor paintings.

Boyd has written and curated three books, each of which comprise his personal illustrations, photography, song lyrics, and additional thoughts and writings. His books are &quot;White Fluffy Clouds&quot; (2003), &quot;From the Murks of the Sultry Abyss&quot; (2007), and &quot;So the Echo&quot; (2013), all published under his book imprint, Endophasia Publications.

=== Solo career ===
On July 6, 2010, Boyd announced that his debut solo album, &quot;The Wild Trapeze&quot; was released. On June 21, 2010, a music video for Boyd&#x27;s first single from &quot;The Wild Trapeze&quot;, &quot;Runaway Train&quot;, was released. A second music video was released for the album, for the song &quot;Last Night a Passenger&quot; in October 2010.

On January 18, 2013, Boyd announced his band, Sons of the Sea. With Incubus on hiatus, Sons of the Sea toured in 2013 and 2014. On May 29, 2013, Boyd released a teaser video announcing the name of the album, &quot;Sons of the Sea&quot;. That same year, he embarked on a book-signing tour of the Northeast to coincide with his latest publication &quot;&#x27;So The Echo&quot;, as well as the release of Sons of the Sea&#x27;s eponymous record.

On March 11, 2022, Boyd released &quot;Echoes &amp; Cocoons&quot;, produced by John Congleton.

In 2022 and 2023, Boyd appeared as White Jesus in seasons 2 and 3 of the series &quot;Reservation Dogs&quot;.

In February 2024, he was featured on the Night Verses&#x27;s single &quot;Glitching Prisms&quot;.

==Personal life==

In the spring of 2011, Boyd made a large mural at the Hurley Space Gallery in order to raise awareness about single use plastics and their harmful effects on the world&#x27;s oceans. Boyd is involved with many organizations and charitable causes and in 2003, along with his Incubus bandmates, he founded the 501(c)(3) non-profit The Make Yourself Foundation, which has raised over $1.4 million for various philanthropic causes locally and globally. The organization has awarded grant funding to over 60 nonprofit organizations.

In a recent Rolling Stone Interview, Boyd stated he is married and that his wife is a fan of Lizzo. Lizzo would later join Incubus for a performance of “Aqueous Transmission&quot; at the Hollywood Bowl.

<doc id="104933" wikidata="Q201469" url="?curid=104933" title="Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum">
<text>The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, often referred to as The Guggenheim, is an art museum at 1071 Fifth Avenue between 88th and 89th Streets on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City. It hosts a permanent collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, early Modern and contemporary art and also features special exhibitions throughout the year. It was established by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1939 as the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, under the guidance of its first director, Hilla von Rebay. The museum adopted its current name in 1952, three years after the death of its founder Solomon R. Guggenheim. It continues to be operated and owned by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation.

The museum&#x27;s building, a landmark work of 20th-century architecture designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, drew controversy for the unusual shape of its display spaces and took 15 years to design and build; it was completed in 1959. It consists of a six-story, bowl-shaped main gallery to the south, a four-story &quot;monitor&quot; to the north, and a ten-story annex to the northeast. A six-story helical ramp extends along the main gallery&#x27;s perimeter, under a central ceiling skylight. The Thannhauser Collection is housed within the top three stories of the monitor, and there are additional galleries in the annex and a learning center in the basement. The museum building&#x27;s design was controversial when it was completed but was widely praised afterward. The building underwent extensive renovations from 1990 to 1992, when the annex was built, and it was renovated again from 2005 to 2008.

The museum&#x27;s collection has grown over the decades and is founded upon several important private collections, including those of Guggenheim, Karl Nierendorf, Katherine Sophie Dreier, Justin Thannhauser, Rebay, Giuseppe Panza, Robert Mapplethorpe and the Bohen Foundation. The collection, which includes around 8,000 works , is shared with sister museums in Bilbao, Spain and Venice, Italy. In 2023, nearly 861,000 people visited the museum.

== History ==

=== Early years and Hilla Rebay ===
Solomon R. Guggenheim, a member of a wealthy mining family, began collecting works of the old masters in the 1890s. In 1926, he met artist Hilla von Rebay, who introduced him to European avant-garde art, in particular abstract art that she felt had a spiritual and utopian aspect (non-objective art). Guggenheim completely changed his collecting strategy, turning to the work of Wassily Kandinsky, among others. He began to display his collection to the public at his apartment in the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Guggenheim and Rebay initially considered building a museum at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. As the collection grew, Guggenheim established the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, in 1937, to foster the appreciation of modern art.
The foundation&#x27;s first venue, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, opened in 1939, under Rebay&#x27;s direction, at 24 East 54th Street in midtown Manhattan. Under her guidance, Guggenheim sought to include in the collection the most important examples of non-objective art by early modernists. He wanted to display the collection at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair in Queens, but Rebay advocated for a more permanent location in Manhattan. By the early 1940s, the foundation had accumulated such a large collection of avant-garde paintings that the need for a permanent museum was apparent, and Rebay wanted to establish it before Guggenheim died.

==== Design process ====
In 1943, Rebay and Guggenheim wrote a letter to Frank Lloyd Wright asking him to design a structure to house and display the collection. Rebay thought the 76-year-old Wright was dead, but Guggenheim&#x27;s wife Irene Rothschild Guggenheim knew better and suggested that Rebay contact him. Wright accepted the opportunity to experiment with his &quot;organic&quot; style in an urban setting, saying that he had never seen a museum that was &quot;properly designed&quot;. He was hired to design the building in June 1943. He was to receive a 10 percent commission on the project, which was expected to cost at least $1 million. It took him 15 years, more than 700 sketches and six sets of working drawings to create and complete the museum, after a series of difficulties and delays; the cost eventually doubled from the initial estimate.

Rebay envisioned a space that would facilitate a new way of seeing modern art. She wrote Wright that &quot;each of these great masterpieces should be organized into space, and only you ... would test the possibilities to do so. ... I want a temple of spirit, a monument!&quot; Critic Paul Goldberger later wrote that Wright&#x27;s modernist building was a catalyst for change, making it &quot;socially and culturally acceptable for an architect to design a highly expressive, intensely personal museum. In this sense almost every museum of our time is a child of the Guggenheim.&quot; The Guggenheim is the only museum Wright designed; its urban location required him to design it in a vertical rather than horizontal form, far different from his earlier, rural works. Since he was not licensed as an architect in New York, he relied on Arthur Cort Holden, of the architectural firm Holden, McLaughlin &amp; Associates, to deal with New York City&#x27;s Board of Standards and Appeals.
From 1943 to early 1944, Wright produced four differing designs. One had a hexagonal shape and level floors for the galleries, though all the others had circular schemes and used a ramp continuing around the building. In his notes, he indicated that he wanted a &quot;well proportioned floor space from bottom to top—a wheel chair going around and up and down&quot;. His original concept was called an inverted &quot;ziggurat&quot;, because it resembled the steep steps on the ziggurats built in ancient Mesopotamia. Several architecture professors have speculated that the helical ramp and glass dome of Giuseppe Momo&#x27;s 1932 staircase at the Vatican Museums was an inspiration for Wright&#x27;s ramp and atrium.

==== Site selection and announcement of plans ====
Wright expected that the museum would be in lower Manhattan. Instead, in March 1944, Rebay and Guggenheim acquired a site on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, at the corner of 89th Street and the Museum Mile section of Fifth Avenue, overlooking Central Park. They considered numerous locations in Manhattan, as well as the Riverdale section of the Bronx, overlooking the Hudson River. Guggenheim felt that the Fifth Avenue site&#x27;s proximity to Central Park was important, as the park afforded relief from the noise, congestion and concrete of the city. Wright&#x27;s preliminary sketches fit the site nearly perfectly, although the site was about narrower than what Wright anticipated. Guggenheim approved Wright&#x27;s sketches in mid-1944. Wright called the planned building an &quot;Archeseum ... a building in which to see the highest&quot;.

Wright&#x27;s designs were announced in July 1945, and the museum was expected to cost $1 million and be completed within a year. The structure&#x27;s main feature was a main gallery with a helical ramp, surrounding a lightwell with a skylight. Guests would board an elevator to reach the top; a second, steeper ramp would serve as an emergency exit. There would be a movie theater in the basement, an elevator tower topped by an observatory, and a smaller building featuring a smaller theater, in addition to storage space, a library and a cafe. Preliminary plans also included apartments for Guggenheim and Rebay, but these plans were scrapped. Guggenheim acquired an additional parcel of land on 88th Street that July. Wright built a model of the museum at Taliesin, his home in Wisconsin, and displayed it at the Plaza Hotel that September.

==== Difficulties ====
The building&#x27;s construction was delayed, first because of material shortages caused by World War II, then by increasing construction costs after the war. By late 1946, Guggenheim and Rebay had redesigned the basement theater to accommodate concerts. Rebay and Wright disagreed over several aspects of the design, such as the means by which the paintings were to be mounted, although they both wanted the design to &quot;reflect the unity of art and architecture&quot;. Wright continued to modify his plans during the late 1940s, largely because of concerns over the building&#x27;s lighting, and created another model of the museum in 1947. The collection was greatly expanded in 1948 through the purchase of art dealer Karl Nierendorf&#x27;s estate of some 730 works.

Progress remained stalled through the late 1940s, and William Muschenheim renovated an existing townhouse on the site, at 1071 Fifth Avenue, for the museum&#x27;s use. Guggenheim&#x27;s health was in decline, but he refused Wright&#x27;s offer to downsize the planned building so it could be completed during Guggenheim&#x27;s lifetime. After Guggenheim died in 1949, members of the Guggenheim family on the foundation&#x27;s board of directors had personal and philosophical differences with Rebay. Under Rebay&#x27;s leadership, the museum had become what Aline B. Saarinen described as an &quot;esoteric, occult place in which a mystic language was spoken&quot;. Some of the museum&#x27;s staff and trustees wished to oust Rebay and cancel Wright&#x27;s design. Wright, however, persuaded several members of the Guggenheim family to acquire additional land on Fifth Avenue so his design could be developed in full.

To accommodate the growing collection, in August 1951 the Guggenheim Foundation acquired an apartment building at 1 East 88th Street to remodel for museum use. It now owned a continuous frontage on Fifth Avenue from 88th to 89th Street. This prompted Wright to redesign the new building yet again, proposing a multi-story annex with apartments behind the museum. The foundation also announced that the museum would start exhibiting &quot;objective&quot; works of art, as well as older artwork. Rebay, who disagreed with this policy, resigned as director of the museum in March 1952. Nevertheless, she left a portion of her personal collection to the foundation in her will. Shortly after Rebay resigned, Wright filed plans for the building, which was now projected to cost $2 million. It was renamed the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1952.

=== Sweeney era ===
James Johnson Sweeney was appointed the museum&#x27;s director in October 1952. He expanded the foundation&#x27;s collecting criteria, rejecting Rebay&#x27;s dismissal of &quot;objective&quot; painting and sculpture, and started exhibiting some of the works placed in storage under Rebay&#x27;s leadership. In 1953, the museum hosted a retrospective of Wright&#x27;s work, &quot;Sixty Years of Living Architecture&quot;, in a temporary pavilion Wright had designed.

==== Construction and opening ====

Sweeney and Wright had a strained relationship, as they disagreed over basic elements of the museum&#x27;s plan. Sweeney, who believed its architecture should be subservient to the art, forced Wright to redesign it to accommodate more offices and storage facilities. The building&#x27;s lighting was a significant point of contention between them. The New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) also rejected Wright&#x27;s application for a construction permit in 1953 because the design did not meet building codes. Wright tasked Holden with ensuring that the design met codes and published revised drawings in 1954 and 1956. Museum staff nevertheless complained that Wright&#x27;s design did not provide enough storage or laboratory space. To save money, he modified the design again in 1955, though these savings were canceled out by increasing construction costs.

Four general contractors submitted bids in late 1954, and the foundation ultimately hired the Euclid Construction Corporation. The museum rented the Oliver Gould Jennings House at 7 East 72nd Street and relocated there before construction began. On May 6, 1956, demolition of the site&#x27;s existing buildings began. The DOB issued a construction permit on May 23, and work on the museum began on August 14. Wright opened an office in New York City to oversee the construction, which he felt required his personal attention, and appointed his son-in-law William Wesley Peters to supervise the day-to-day work. In practice, neither Wright nor Peters visited the site frequently, so Holden&#x27;s William Short ended up managing the project.

Sweeney wanted the new museum to allow &quot;building up a collection which offers up a standard of judgment&quot;. He wanted to change the color scheme, level out the sloping walls and remove the clerestory windows, which led to prolonged disputes with Wright. By early 1958, Harry F. Guggenheim had to handle all communications between Sweeney and Wright, who would not speak to each other. The building topped out in May 1958, and the scaffolding on the facade was removed by that August. Meanwhile, Wright published drawings of the design in several architectural magazines, as he feared the design would be compromised after his death. Against his request, Sweeney painted the walls white and hung paintings from metal bars instead of placing them directly on the walls. The building was Wright&#x27;s last major work; he died in April 1959, six months before its opening.

The building soft-opened for members of the media on October 20, 1959. It was formally dedicated the next day, drawing 600 visitors per hour. Its design was generally able to accommodate the retrospectives and temporary exhibits that it hosted over the years.

===Messer era===
Sweeney resigned as the museum&#x27;s director in July 1960, citing philosophical differences with the board of trustees, and H. H. Arnason took over as temporary director. He launched &quot;the first survey of Abstract Expressionism in a New York museum&quot; during his brief time as director. Thomas M. Messer, director of the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art, succeeded Sweeney as director in January 1961; he worked under Sweeney, who continued to run the foundation. Messer stayed for 27 years, the longest tenure of any director of a major New York art institution. Under his leadership, the museum&#x27;s collection expanded significantly. The collection pivoted toward more contemporary artists, including those from Europe and Latin America, and expanded in scope to become &quot;New York&#x27;s second museum of modern art&quot;. Messer was not considered &quot;an especially controversial director&quot;, though he also did not adhere to &quot;the blockbuster school of exhibiting&quot;.

==== 1960s ====

When Messer joined the Guggenheim, the museum&#x27;s ability to present artworks was still doubted because of the tilted and curved walls. Almost immediately after becoming director, in 1962, he put on a large exhibition that combined the Guggenheim&#x27;s paintings with sculptures on loan from the Hirshhorn collection. In particular, there were difficulties installing three-dimensional sculptures because the slope of the floor and the curvature of the walls could combine to produce vexing optical illusions. Though the combination proved generally to work well in the Guggenheim, Messer recalled that, at the time, &quot;I was scared. I half felt that this would be my last exhibition.&quot; He had staged a smaller sculpture exhibition the previous year, where he learned how to compensate for the space&#x27;s unusual geometry by constructing special plinths at a particular angle, but this was impossible for one piece, an Alexander Calder mobile whose wire inevitably hung at a true plumb vertical.

After Messer acquired a private collection from art dealer Justin Thannhauser in 1963, the Guggenheim hired Peters to renovate the monitor&#x27;s second floor. Thannhauser&#x27;s collection was displayed within the monitor after the renovation was completed in 1965. The foundation auctioned off artwork from the 15th and 16th centuries, which was incompatible with the museum&#x27;s modern-art collection. Rebay, who died in 1967, bequeathed over 600 artworks to the Guggenheim, although the museum did not receive the collection until 1971. To raise money for further acquisitions, such as the works in Rebay&#x27;s collections, the Guggenheim also sold off some modern artwork, including several Kandinsky works.

To accommodate the expanding collection, in 1963, the Guggenheim announced plans for a four-story annex, which the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals approved the next year. William Wesley Peters of Taliesin Associated Architects, the successor firm to Wright&#x27;s practice, designed the addition. The annex was downsized to two stories in 1966 due to complaints from local residents, and was completed in 1968. This freed up space on the main gallery&#x27;s top two levels, which had been used as workshops and storage space ever since the building opened. Museum officials opened the top levels to the public in 1968.

==== 1970s and 1980s ====
In 1971, with increasing costs and decreasing endowment income, the Guggenheim recorded a large deficit for the first time in its history. Additionally, although Wright had included space for a cafe at the southern end of the museum building, the space was instead used by the conservation and framing departments. The foundation proposed adding a lobby and restaurant in the museum&#x27;s driveway area in early 1973 but had difficulty agreeing on the plans, which were revised that November. As part of the project, designed by Donald E. Freed, the museum closed its driveway and added a dining area and bookstore there. Facing a growing deficit and a shortage of exhibit space, the Guggenheim announced in 1977 that it would raise $20 million over the following five years. Museum officials also planned to expand the annex on 89th Street.

Messer became director of the Guggenheim Foundation in 1980 and continued to serve as the museum director, promoting two curators to directorial positions. The Guggenheim renovated the Thannhauser wing in the early 1980s. Following these changes, John Russell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the Thannhauser Collection &quot;may now be said to be the equivalent of the Frick in the domain of modern art.&quot; &quot;Works &amp; Process&quot;, a series of performances at the Guggenheim, commenced in 1984.

In 1982 Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates Architects drew up designs for an 11-story annex on 88th Street, behind the existing museum building. The original plan, announced in February 1985, would have been cantilevered over the existing building. The design was downsized to 10 stories in early 1987 due to opposition from local residents. At the time, the building could only exhibit 150 pieces, about 3 percent of the museum&#x27;s 5000-work collection. In anticipation of the annex&#x27;s construction and a wider-ranging renovation of the older building, Gwathmey Siegel also renovated the Thannhauser wing&#x27;s second floor and the top level of the main gallery&#x27;s ramp in 1987. The Board of Standards and Appeals approved the 89th Street annex that October, despite continuing opposition. Messer retired the next month, on the 50th anniversary of the collection&#x27;s founding. The New York City Board of Estimate approved plans for the Guggenheim&#x27;s annex in 1988, and the New York Supreme Court upheld the Board of Estimate&#x27;s decision.

===Krens era===
Thomas Krens, former director of the Williams College Museum of Art, took over as the director of both the museum and the foundation in January 1988. Over his nearly two-decade tenure, he led a rapid expansion of the museum&#x27;s collections, and the museum mounted some of its most popular exhibitions, including &quot;Africa: The Art of a Continent&quot; in 1996; &quot;China: 5,000 Years&quot; in 1998; &quot;Brazil: Body &amp; Soul&quot; in 2001; and &quot;The Aztec Empire&quot; in 2004. Unusual exhibitions included &quot;The Art of the Motorcycle&quot;, an industrial design installation of motorcycles. 

The Guggenheim Museum SoHo, designed by Arata Isozaki, opened in June 1992 at the corner of Broadway and Prince Street in SoHo, Manhattan. The SoHo building&#x27;s exhibits included &quot;Marc Chagall and the Jewish Theater&quot;, &quot;Paul Klee at the Guggenheim Museum&quot;, &quot;Robert Rauschenberg: A Retrospective&quot; and &quot;Andy Warhol: The Last Supper&quot;. It did not meet visitor forecasts and closed in 2002.
==== 1990s ====

Shortly after becoming director, Krens decided to spend $24 million renovating the Guggenheim. Work commenced in late 1989. The museum initially remained open, but later closed for 18 months. The monitor wing was restored, the 88th Street wing was converted from a conservation laboratory to a restaurant, and additional exhibition space was created at the top of the main gallery. The 89th Street annex was built as part of this project, and the basement was extended under Fifth Avenue. The windows were replaced and the clerestory windows along the ramp were unsealed and restored to their original design. The building&#x27;s exhibition space roughly doubled, allowing the museum to show 6 percent of its collection.

The renovation was completed on June 27, 1992. The museum&#x27;s offices were moved to the annex, the basement and the former Guggenheim Museum SoHo, and storage space and conservation activities were moved to other buildings. The new annex allowed the museum to show more works from its permanent collection, as well as temporary exhibitions. The foundation acquired 200 photographs from Robert Mapplethorpe in 1992 and renamed the annex&#x27;s fourth-floor gallery after him in 1993.

To finance the renovation and new acquisitions, the foundation sold works by Kandinsky, Chagall and Modigliani, raising $47 million. This move was controversial, drawing considerable criticism for trading masters for &quot;trendy&quot; latecomers. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Michael Kimmelman wrote that the sales &quot;stretched the accepted rules of deaccessioning further than many American institutions have been willing to do.&quot; Krens defended the action as consistent with the museum&#x27;s principles by expanding its international collection and building its &quot;postwar collection to the strength of our pre-war holdings&quot;, and noted that museums regularly conduct such sales. He also expanded the foundation&#x27;s international presence by opening museums abroad.

Krens was also criticized for his businesslike style and perceived populism and commercialization. One writer commented, &quot;Krens has been both praised and vilified for turning what was once a small New York institution into a worldwide brand, creating the first truly multinational arts institution. ... Krens transformed the Guggenheim into one of the best-known brand names in the arts.&quot; The museum cut back its operating hours in 1994, causing a 25 percent decline in annual attendance, even as the city&#x27;s other art museums saw increased attendance.

Samuel J. LeFrak announced in December 1993 that he would donate $10 million, the largest cash donation in the museum&#x27;s history, with the Fifth Avenue building to be renamed for him and his wife. The next month, Ronald O. Perelman announced that he would also donate $10 million. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), which had designated the building as a landmark, repeatedly refused to allow officials to place a sign with LeFrak&#x27;s name outside the building. Consequently, LeFrak rescinded $8 million of his donation. Peter B. Lewis donated $10 million in 1995 for the restoration of the museum&#x27;s auditorium, which was renamed the Peter B. Lewis Theater after the project was completed the next year. Lewis donated an additional $50 million in 1998, and several other trustees, including Perelman, increased their donations.

==== 2000s ====

The museum opened an arts center in the basement in 2001; originally named for the Sackler family, it was renamed the Gail May Engelberg Center for Arts Education in 2022. Also in 2001, as part of a Frank Gehry retrospective at the museum, Gehry designed a canopy, which was installed outside the fifth floor. It remained in place for six years after the retrospective ended.

By 2004, museum officials were raising $25 million for another restoration of the building and hired Swanke Hayden Connell Architects to survey it. By then, the structure had developed numerous leaks. After architects and engineers determined that the building was structurally sound, renovations began in September 2005 to repair cracks and modernize systems and exterior details. The restoration mainly consisted of exterior and infrastructure upgrades, preserving as many historical details as possible while allowing museum operations to continue. On September 22, 2008, the Guggenheim celebrated the project&#x27;s completion with the premiere of artist Jenny Holzer&#x27;s tribute &quot;For the Guggenheim&quot;. The renovation cost $29 million and was funded by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation&#x27;s board of trustees, the city&#x27;s Department of Cultural Affairs, the New York state government and MAPEI Corporation.

Meanwhile, during the early 2000s, Krens was involved in a long-running dispute with Lewis, who was also chairman of the foundation&#x27;s board of directors. When admission declined by 60 percent following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the museum faced budgetary deficits, as one-quarter of its revenue came from ticket sales. Lewis donated $12 million to the museum in 2002 under the condition that Krens tighten the budget. Despite having given $77 million, more than any other donor in the Guggenheim&#x27;s history, Lewis did not have as much influence over the board&#x27;s decisions as did top donors at the city&#x27;s other art museums. Lewis resigned from the board of directors in 2005, expressing opposition to Krens&#x27;s plans for additional museums around the world.

Longtime curator Lisa Dennison was hired as the museum&#x27;s new director in 2005, working under Krens, who continued to direct the foundation. By 2006, the museum faces a $35 million deficit, even as Dennison rejected the idea of funding exhibits through corporate sponsorships. Dennison resigned in July 2007 to work at auction house Sotheby&#x27;s. Tensions between Krens and the board continued, and Krens stepped down as foundation director in February 2008.

===Armstrong era===

Richard Armstrong, former director of the Carnegie Museum of Art, became the director of the museum and the foundation in November 2008. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the Guggenheim Foundation had selected him because his &quot;calmer, steadier presence&quot; contrasted with the &quot;nearly 20 often tumultuous years of Mr. Krens&#x27;s maverick vision&quot;. In addition to its permanent collections, which continued to grow under his direction, the foundation has administered loan exhibitions and co-organized exhibitions with other museums to foster public outreach. The museum hosted exhibitions such as &quot;America&quot; (2016), one of the smallest ever hosted there.

About 140 maintenance workers and art installers joined a labor union in 2019, the first time the museum&#x27;s employees had unionized. That year, Chaédria LaBouvier became the first black woman curator to create a solo exhibition and first black person to write a text published by the museum. She accused the museum of racism and alleged that, among other things, officials withheld resources and refused to let journalists interview her, though an article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described LaBouvier as being hostile toward people who commented on her exhibition. Within a month of these criticisms, the museum hired its first full-time black curator, Ashley James. An investigation by a law firm hired by the museum found &quot;no evidence that Ms. LaBouvier was subject to adverse treatment on the basis of her race&quot;. The museum&#x27;s Artistic Director and Chief Curator, Nancy Spector, left the institution in 2020 after 34 years. The Guggenheim approved a plan for increasing racial diversity in August 2020, and it hired a &quot;chief culture and inclusion officer&quot; in 2021.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Guggenheim temporarily closed in March 2020. It reopened that October, recording a monthly net loss of $1.4 million while closed. It fired numerous staff members during the pandemic. In 2022, the Guggenheim began hosting a poet-in-residence program, the first such program at a visual-art museum. Armstrong announced in mid-2022 that he planned to resign in 2023, and he left the museum at the end of 2023.

=== Westermann era ===
In June 2024, Mariët Westermann became the Guggenheim&#x27;s first female director. She had been the vice chancellor of New York University Abu Dhabi since 2019 and was its provost when it was formed in 2007 and was responsible for, among other things, its first climate action plan. She holds Master&#x27;s and Ph.D. degrees in the History of Art from New York University Institute of Fine Arts. Following unsuccessful attempts to steady the museum&#x27;s finances by expanding the endowment, increasing ticket prices and reducing the number of exhibits, Westermann terminated about 7% of the museum&#x27;s staff in early 2025.

== Architecture ==
Wright&#x27;s design for the Guggenheim Museum incorporated geometric motifs, such as squares, circles, rectangles, triangles and lozenges. The massing contains two spiraling structures, the six-story main gallery to the south and the smaller &quot;monitor&quot; to the north, which are connected by a &quot;bridge&quot; on the second story. The ten-story rectangular annex, to the northeast, appears behind the spiraling structures as viewed from Central Park.

The building embodies Wright&#x27;s attempts &quot;to render the inherent plasticity of organic forms in architecture&quot;. Wright&#x27;s design included details inspired by nature, although it also expresses his take on modernist architecture&#x27;s rigid geometry. Wright described a symbolic meaning to the building&#x27;s shapes: &quot;[T]hese geometric forms suggest certain human ideas, moods, sentiments – as for instance: the circle, infinity; the triangle, structural unity; the spiral, organic progress; the square, integrity.&quot; Forms echo one another throughout: oval-shaped columns, for example, reiterate the geometry of the fountain. Circularity is the leitmotif, from the main gallery to the inlays in the museum&#x27;s terrazzo floors.

=== Exterior ===
Wright originally wanted to construct a marble facade, but builder George N. Cohen constructed the facade of gunite, a type of sprayed concrete, as a cost-cutting measure. Wright&#x27;s and Cohen&#x27;s names appear on a tile placed along the building&#x27;s exterior; this is likely the only time when Wright and a builder shared credit for a building&#x27;s construction. Wright had also proposed a red-colored exterior, which was never realized. Instead, the facade was covered in an ivory-colored coating of vinyl plastic, known as a &quot;cocoon&quot;. The engineers involved in the original construction thought that the &quot;cocoon&quot; would not crack, so the facade was built without expansion joints; they were wrong: the facade cracked in subsequent years. During subsequent renovations, conservators found that the facade was originally painted brownish yellow, which was covered with numerous coats of white or off-white paint over the years.

The sidewalk in front of the museum acts as a forecourt, with metal circles inset into its surface, similar in design to the floor inside the museum. Next to the sidewalk are curving parapets that surround planting beds, some of which are below ground level. The planting beds originally contained shrubs, sycamore trees and other vegetation.

==== Original building ====
The museum&#x27;s main entrance is at the center of the Fifth Avenue facade. It consists of an aluminum-framed glass wall with several doors, recessed within a low foyer. A doorway directly in front of the entrance leads to the bookstore, while the museum galleries are accessed by doors to the right. Above the main entrance is a &quot;bridge&quot; connecting the main gallery and monitor building, which is supported by several lozenge-shaped piers. The underside of the bridge contains recessed lighting that illuminates the main entrance. The main entrance was originally the entrance to a driveway that curved toward 89th Street, with separate entrances to the monitor and main gallery. The glass wall was installed after the driveway was closed in the 1970s, and the museum&#x27;s bookstore was placed directly behind the wall. To the south of the main entrance is a curved wall, which forms the base of the main gallery. There is a ramp adjacent to this wall, which leads to the basement auditorium.

At the southeast corner of the museum, on 88th Street, is a rectangular structure, which contains no openings except for five circular portals at ground level. The structure contains the museum&#x27;s cafe, which was part of Wright&#x27;s original plans but was not developed until 1992. The second floor of the rectangular structure contains the High Gallery. Immediately to the east, on 88th Street, is an aluminum service gate with circular designs.

The bridge, which carries the Guggenheim&#x27;s second story, projects at the museum&#x27;s southwest corner. The museum&#x27;s name stretches along the bottom edge of the bridge&#x27;s Fifth Avenue facade. The main gallery rises above the southern part of the bridge; it consists of a &quot;bowl&quot;-shaped massing, with several concrete &quot;bands&quot; separated by recessed aluminum skylights. From the street, the building looks like a white ribbon curled into a cylindrical stack, wider at the top than the bottom, displaying nearly all curved surfaces. Its appearance is in sharp contrast to the typically rectangular Manhattan buildings that surround it, a fact relished by Wright, who claimed that his museum would make the nearby Metropolitan Museum of Art &quot;look like a Protestant barn&quot;. At the top of the &quot;bowl&quot; is a parapet, which surrounds three smaller skylights, as well as the large twelve-sided dome atop the main gallery.

The northern part of the bridge contains a four-story wing, originally known as the monitor. Although the monitor&#x27;s interior is cylindrical, its exterior contains different materials and shapes on each story. The monitor&#x27;s first two stories contain a round concrete facade, while the upper two stories are cantilevered outward from the monitor&#x27;s core. The third story contains rectangular aluminum windows with semicircular panes at their tops. The fourth story contains a square terrace and additional windows. Above the fourth story is a fascia with lozenge patterns, as well as a hexagonal roof with an aluminum frame. The roof is interrupted by a lozenge-shaped shaft, which contains a stairway.

==== Annex ====
A ten-story tower at the museum&#x27;s northeastern corner, with offices, artist&#x27;s studios and apartments, included in Wright&#x27;s 1951 plan for the museum, was a rectangular structure, aligned on a north–south axis; it would have contained porches at each story on the northern and southern elevations. Wright&#x27;s original plan for the tower went unrealized, largely for financial reasons, until the 1990–1992 renovation and expansion. Instead William Wesley Peters designed a shorter wing on the site in 1968, with two double-height floors. This wing was made of concrete, with relief carvings of squares and octagons on its facade, and housed the museum&#x27;s library, storage space and the Thannhauser Gallery. Its steel framework could accommodate the weight of six additional stories if it were expanded.

Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates designed a 10-story annex that was built during the 1990s renovation. The annex, measuring wide and tall, uses the 1968 wing&#x27;s steel framework. During the renovation, Gwathmey Siegel removed the 1968 concrete facade and replaced it with a limestone grid. They analyzed Wright&#x27;s original sketches when they designed the tower.

=== Interior ===
The core part of Guggenheim&#x27;s interior consists of the monitor section to the north, the larger main gallery to the south and a lecture hall beneath the main gallery. To the east of the main entrance is the bookstore, in the area that was originally part of the museum&#x27;s driveway. To the south of the main entrance is a small circular vestibule, which contains a floor with metal arcs and a low plaster ceiling with recessed lighting. South of the main rotunda is a cafe, added during the 1990s renovation.

The triangular service core, at the northeast corner of the main gallery, contains an elevator and a staircase. The staircase wraps around the elevator, which is housed within a semicircular shaft; the core also contains restrooms and mechanical areas. According to author Robert McCarter, Wright had used &quot;complete geometries&quot; for the stairs and ramps because he wanted visitors to experience the museum on foot. Other rooms, such as the staff kitchen, were designed with curved equipment because of the interior&#x27;s unusual design. The museum&#x27;s interior is generally painted white, and parts of the interior are repainted nearly every day.

==== Main gallery ====

Wright designed the main gallery (also described as a rotunda) as an open-air atrium, surrounded by a helical ramp. Wright&#x27;s design differed from the conventional approach to museum layout, in which visitors pass through a series of interconnected rooms and retrace their steps when exiting. Under Wright&#x27;s plan, guests rode an elevator to the top of the building and descended the ramp, viewing the main gallery itself as a work of art. The ramp&#x27;s design recalled a nautilus shell, with continuous spaces flowing one into another. The open rotunda allows guests to observe works on different levels simultaneously and interact with guests on other levels. Structurally, the ramp acts like an enormous arch, preventing the columns in the main gallery from collapsing inward.

The main gallery has a beige terrazzo floor with inlaid metal circles. At ground level are wooden information and admissions desks, and windows face southeast toward Fifth Avenue and 88th Street. The ramp, made of reinforced concrete, ascends at a 5 percent slope from ground level and rises one story, where it wraps around a planter and passes through a double-height archway. It rises five additional stories before ending at the sixth floor, with a total length of . Its width increases as it ascends, from on the lowest level to at the top. The ramp protrudes into the northeastern corner of the atrium at each story, forming a rounded balcony. There are connections to other galleries at the second and fourth stories, and to a triangular gallery at the sixth story. The ramp has a low parapet along the atrium side, measuring high.

The walls and ceilings are made of plaster. To create the concrete walls, workers sprayed several layers of concrete onto plywood moldings, each layer being reinforced with steel. Wright intended the low ceilings and slanted walls to provide a &quot;more intimate environment&quot; to display the artwork. The walls are tilted at a 97-degree angle, and the ceilings measure tall. Jaroslav Josef Polívka assisted Wright with the structural design, and he initially designed the gallery ramp without perimeter columns. Later in the design, Wright added a dozen concrete ribs along the walls of the main gallery, which both provide structural reinforcement and divide the ramp into sections. The ramp passes through 70 sections in total. Although Wright wanted the paintings displayed as if they were on an easel, paintings are mounted onto horizontal bars that protrude from the sloped wall. There is limited space for sculptures within each bay, and wider paintings frequently span the center of the curved wall.

The ramp was originally illuminated by clerestory windows along the perimeter of each level, which were sealed when the building was completed. Each level of the ramp also contains recessed lighting on its ceiling. The domed skylight, named the Lawson-Johnston Family Oculus, is around high and is the same width as the atrium. Metal bars divide the skylight into numerous panes. Along the dome are six hairpin-shaped &quot;spokes&quot;, which surround a circular glass panel and connect with the &quot;ribs&quot; along the gallery&#x27;s perimeter. These spokes divide the skylight into twelve sections. The original plans called for the dome to be illuminated by 24 floodlights. The clerestory windows and skylight were restored in 1992.

==== Monitor section ====
The museum&#x27;s &quot;monitor&quot; houses the Thannhauser Collection. Its galleries surround an atrium that is circular except for a stair hall at one end of the space. The floors are supported by columns with lozenge-shaped cross-sections. Like the main gallery, the monitor contains a triangular service core, although its core is placed at the center of the structure. The monitor was originally supposed to include apartments for Rebay and Guggenheim, but this area became offices and storage space. In 1965, the second floor of the monitor was renovated to display some of the museum&#x27;s growing permanent collection. Part of the fourth floor was similarly converted in 1980. With the restoration of the museum in the early 1990s, the second through fourth floors were converted entirely to exhibition space and renamed the Thannhauser Building.

==== Gail May Engelberg Center for Arts Education ====

The Gail May Engelberg Center for Arts Education, completed in 2001, covers on the lower level of the museum, below the main gallery. It was a gift of the Mortimer D. Sackler family and was originally named for them. The facility provides classes and lectures about the visual and performing arts and opportunities to interact with the museum&#x27;s collections and special exhibitions through its labs, exhibition spaces, conference rooms and 266-seat Peter B. Lewis Theater. Following criticism over the Sackler family&#x27;s involvement in the opioid epidemic in the United States, the center was renamed in 2022 for museum trustee Gail May Engelberg, who along with her husband Alfred Engelberg had donated $15 million to the museum.

The basement space looks out onto a sloped driveway outside the southwest corner of the museum. The Peter B. Lewis Theater is directly beneath the main gallery and contains two levels of seating: an orchestra level and a balcony. There is a coatroom at the balcony level, separated from the balcony seats by a metal partition. The southeast corner of the orchestra level contains a raised wooden stage. The theater&#x27;s walls contain embedded piers, as well as semicircular window openings. The plaster ceiling contains recessed cove lighting. When the theater was built, it could be accessed directly from the triangular service core, as well as via the driveway outside the museum.

==== Annex galleries ====
The 89th Street annex contains of additional exhibition space. There are four exhibition galleries with flat walls that are &quot;more appropriate for the display of art&quot;. Each of the gallery levels, are double-height spaces. A loading dock is below the galleries, while two office stories and a mechanical floor are above. A steel-and-glass lobby connects the annex to the monitor&#x27;s ground level, and ramps and passageways connect with the monitor&#x27;s three upper stories. The annex is linked to the main gallery&#x27;s stair tower at the fourth, fifth and seventh stories. It also connects to rooftop terraces above the monitor and main gallery.

=== Landmark designations ===
The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the museum building and its interior as New York City landmarks on August 14, 1990, two years after opponents of the annex&#x27;s construction had asked the commission to consider such a designation. At the time, the Guggenheim was one of the youngest buildings to have city landmark status, having been completed 31 years earlier. When the LPC enlarged its Carnegie Hill Historic District in 1993, the Guggenheim Museum was included in the expanded district.

The museum was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on May 19, 2005, and was designated as a National Historic Landmark on October 6, 2008. UNESCO added eight properties, including the Guggenheim, to the World Heritage List in July 2019 under the title &quot;The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;.

== Collection ==
The Guggenheim has about 8,000 works in its collection . About 1,700 are part of its online collection. The museum building has a relatively small capacity; according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, following the 1992 renovation, the Guggenheim could show &quot;upward of 6%&quot; of its then 5,000-piece collection. Other pieces are kept in the museum&#x27;s storeroom. In contrast to other visual-art museums, the Guggenheim does not divide its collection into departments. The permanent collection is typically displayed in the side galleries and annexes, while the main gallery is used for special exhibitions.

The Guggenheim shares its collection with the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice and Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. It has also loaned objects to Guggenheim Abu Dhabi for a preview exhibit. After Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s death in 1979, the Guggenheim Foundation began to operate the Venice museum, and Guggenheim New York began to exhibit abstract expressionist, cubist and surrealist art from both the Venice and New York museums together.

=== Personal collections ===
The Guggenheim Museum has acquired private collections throughout its history, including those of Guggenheim, Karl Nierendorf, Katherine Sophie Dreier, Thannhauser, Rebay, Giuseppe Panza, Mapplethorpe and the Bohen Foundation. Its earliest works include modernists such as Rudolf Bauer, Rebay, Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Marc Chagall, Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger, Amedeo Modigliani and Pablo Picasso. Parts of the original collection have been sold over the years. In 2007, 620 of the original works were designated part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Founding Collection, with works by over 60 artists, including more than 150 by Kandinsky. The founding collection contains several pieces by Albert Gleizes, including &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot;, &quot;Composition for &quot;Jazz&quot;&quot; and &quot;Portrait of an Army Doctor&quot;. Pieces such as Chagall&#x27;s &quot;Green Violinist&quot;, Franz Marc&#x27;s &quot;Yellow Cow&quot;, Jean Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;Woman with a Fan&quot;, and Picasso&#x27;s &quot;The Accordionist&quot; are also part of the founding collection. 

In 1948, the Museum of Non-Objective Art acquired Nierendorf&#x27;s 730 objects, notably German expressionist paintings. The Guggenheim still had 121 works from the Nierendorf collection in the 1990s, comprising a broad spectrum of expressionist and surrealist works, including paintings by Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Joan Miró. In 1953, the Guggenheim acquired 28 pieces from Dreier&#x27;s collection, including works by Alexander Archipenko, Constantin Brâncuși, Alexander Calder, Marcel Duchamp, Juan Gris, El Lissitzky, Mondrian and Kurt Schwitters.

The Thannhauser Collection, acquired in 1963, initially consisted of 73 works, largely in the Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and French modern styles, including pieces by Paul Gauguin, Édouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Vincent van Gogh and 32 works by Picasso. Justin Thannhauser&#x27;s widow Hilde donated additional pieces to the Thannhauser Collection in 1981 and 1991, including Manet&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Countess Albazzi&quot;.

Rebay also bequeathed a portion of her personal collection to the foundation, including works by Kandinsky, Klee, Calder, Gleizes, Mondrian and Schwitters. The Guggenheim received the pieces in 1971, four years after her death, because of a prolonged lawsuit. In 1990 the museum acquired the collection of Giovanna and Giuseppe Panza. This includes examples of minimalist sculptures by Carl Andre, Dan Flavin and Donald Judd; minimalist paintings by Robert Mangold, Brice Marden and Robert Ryman; and an array of postminimal, conceptual and perceptual art by Robert Morris, Richard Serra, James Turrell, Lawrence Weiner and others, notably American examples of the 1960s and 1970s. When the Panza Collection was acquired, some of the pieces had not been sculpted, existing only as sketches.

In 1992, the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation gave 200 of Mapplethorpe&#x27;s best photographs to the foundation, marking the museum&#x27;s first major acquisition of 20th-century photography. The works spanned his entire output, from his early collages, Polaroids, portraits of celebrities, self-portraits, male and female nudes, flowers and statues; it also featured mixed-media constructions and included his well-known 1998 &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;. The acquisition initiated the foundation&#x27;s photography exhibition program. In 2001, the foundation received a gift of the collection of the Bohen Foundation, which, for two decades, commissioned new works of art with an emphasis on film, video, photography and new media. It comprises around 275 works by 45 artists, including Pierre Huyghe and Sophie Calle. In 2022, the Guggenheim and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, jointly received 100 works from the D. Daskalopoulos Collection.

=== Other notable works ===
Under Sweeney&#x27;s tenure, in the 1950s, the Guggenheim acquired Brâncuși&#x27;s &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; (1921) and works by other modernist sculptors such as Joseph Csaky, Jean Arp, Calder, Alberto Giacometti and David Smith. Sweeney reached beyond the 20th century to acquire Paul Cézanne&#x27;s &quot;Man with Crossed Arms&quot; () and works by David Hayes, Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. The museum also acquired works by such artists as Aristide Maillol, Jean Messagier, Fritz Hundertwasser and Eduardo Paolozzi, several Giacometti drawings and sculptures, a cubist drawing by Picasso and some Henri-Georges Adam engravings. In the 1960s, among Messer&#x27;s acquisitions were Francis Bacon&#x27;s triptych &quot;Three Studies for a Crucifixion&quot; and David Smith&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Cubi XXVII&quot;. and pieces by Brâncuși, Calder, Giacometti, Klee, Léger, Joan Miró, Egon Schiele and František Kupka.

Originally, the Guggenheim Museum&#x27;s collection did not include any figurative art because of the museum&#x27;s focus on &quot;non-objective painting&quot;, but it later expanded to include a range of figurative pieces, such as a portrait of art critic Felix Feneon by Édouard Vuillard, &quot;Three Studies for a Crucifixion&quot; and Miró&#x27;s painting &quot;The Tilled Field&quot;. Others include Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Le Moulin de la Galette&quot;, &quot;Mandolin and Guitar&quot;, &quot;Woman With Yellow Hair&quot; and &quot;Woman Ironing&quot;; Julian Schnabel&#x27;s &quot;The Student of Prague&quot;; Roy Lichtenstein&#x27;s &quot;Grrrrrrrrrrr!!&quot; and Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Study for Composition II&quot; and &quot;Blue Mountain&quot;.
=== Selected works in the collection ===
== Restitution claims ==
In 2007, the heirs of Berlin banker Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy requested the restitution of the Picasso painting &quot;Le Moulin de la Galette&quot; (1900), which they claimed he had sold under duress by the Nazis. The museum and the heirs settled the lawsuit in 2009. The presiding judge, Jed Rakoff, criticized the secrecy of the accord. In 2018, the museum returned the Ernst Ludwig Kirchner painting &quot;Artillerymen&quot; (1915) to the heirs of Alfred Flechtheim, who had owned the painting before it fell into the hands of a Nazi collector in 1938.

In 2023, the heirs of Karl and Rosie Adler sued the Guggenheim to claim the restitution of a Picasso painting, &quot;Woman Ironing&quot; (&quot;La repasseuse)&quot; (1904), which the Adlers sold to Justin Thannhauser in 1938, allegedly for a fraction of its value, to escape the Holocaust. They alleged that Thannhauser knowingly purchased the painting, and art from other Jews on the run, profiting unfairly from their distress. The museum says they contacted the Adler family before acquiring the painting as a part of Thannhauser&#x27;s bequest of his art collection in 1976, and at that time Karl Adler did not object.

The Guggenheim lists 289 artworks on the Nazi Era Provenance Internet Portal (NEPIP) but does not publish provenance for its collection.

==Governance and staff==
The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation operates and owns the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. The foundation&#x27;s art and museum committee is responsible for proposing acquisitions and deaccessions from the foundation&#x27;s collection, while the foundation&#x27;s board of trustees determines whether to enact the art and museum committee&#x27;s proposals. J. Tomilson Hill has served as the board&#x27;s chair since 2021, while Marcy Withington has been the foundation&#x27;s chief financial officer since 2018. The museum employed 315 full-time and part-time staff members .

== Reception and commentary ==

=== Contemporary views ===
Even before the building opened, the design polarized architecture critics and was controversial among the public. Some critics believed the building would overshadow the museum&#x27;s artworks. Emily Genauer of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; said the building had been likened to &quot;a giant corkscrew, a washing machine and a marshmallow&quot;, while Solomon&#x27;s niece Peggy Guggenheim believed it resembled &quot;a huge garage&quot;. Members of the public felt that the building contrasted with the character of Fifth Avenue. Other critics, and many artists, worried that it would be difficult to properly hang paintings in the shallow, windowless, concave exhibition niches around the main gallery. Prior to the opening of the museum, 21 artists signed a letter protesting the display of their work in such a space. Phyllis Mark of the &quot;New Leader&quot; commented that the walls and ceilings would &quot;disorient the viewer&quot; and noted that the museum could only display five percent of its collection in the new building.

Art critics reviewed the structure especially harshly. John Canaday of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the design would be worthy of merit if it were &quot;stripped of its pictures&quot;, while Hilton Kramer of &quot;Arts Magazine&quot; opined that the structure was &quot;what is probably [Wright&#x27;s] most useless edifice&quot;. Architectural critic Lewis Mumford summed up the opprobrium:
Wright has allotted the paintings and sculptures on view only as much space as would not infringe upon his abstract composition. ... [He] created a shell whose form has no relation to its function and offered no possibility of future departure from his rigid preconceptions. [The ramp] has, for a museum, a low ceiling – nine feet eight inches [295 cm] so only a picture well within the vertical boundaries thus created can be shown. The wall ... slanted outward, following the outward slant of the exterior wall, and paintings were not supposed to be hung vertically or shown in their true plane but were to be tilted back against it. ... Nor [can a visitor] escape the light shining in his eyes from the narrow slots in the wall.

During his lifetime, Wright dismissed criticism of the structure, saying: &quot;For the first time, art will be seen through an open window and, of all places, in New York&quot;. He also felt that his design complemented Central Park, particularly with the shrubbery around the new building, which formed &quot;a little park with a building in it&quot;. Wright believed that the building would be well suited to avant-garde art, &quot;which purported to represent space and form in a new, fully integrated manner&quot;.

The building also received critical acclaim. In a 1958 survey of the &quot;Seven Wonders of American Architecture&quot;, five hundred architects ranked the Guggenheim as the 18th-best structure of more than 100 selected buildings. When the building opened, modernist architects such as Philip Johnson and Edward Durell Stone praised Wright&#x27;s design, and Genauer regarded it as &quot;the most beautiful building in America&quot;. This sentiment was shared even by commentators who questioned the building&#x27;s functionality, including Robert M. Coates of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, who wrote: &quot;My question is not &#x27;Is it art?&#x27; (I believe it is) but &#x27;How well will it house art?&#x27;&quot;. A writer for the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; said the Guggenheim &quot;should be put in a museum to show how mad the twentieth century is.&quot; Directors of other major New York City museums also praised the building, though some of them were skeptical of whether the structure could function well as a museum.

=== Impact and retrospective commentary ===
In later years, the building became widely praised. Marcus Whiffen and Frederick Koeper wrote: &quot;The dynamic interior of the Guggenheim is, for some, too competitive for the display of art, but no one disputes that it is one of the memorable spaces in all of architecture.&quot; Paul Goldberger said in 2009: &quot;I think the legacy of this building is in the message that architecture does not have to lie down and play dead in front of art.&quot; According to Herbert Muschamp, the Guggenheim was &quot;one of New York&#x27;s most distinguished landmarks&quot;, as well as Wright&#x27;s best-known design. The American Institute of Architects gave a Twenty-five Year Award to the Guggenheim in 1986, describing the museum&#x27;s building as &quot;an architectural landmark and a monument to Wright&#x27;s unique vision&quot;.
Several writers described the Guggenheim as representing Wright&#x27;s tendency toward organic architecture. According to William J. R. Curtis, the building was &quot;the apotheosis of Wright&#x27;s organic philosophy&quot;. Peter Blake commented that the Guggenheim was Wright&#x27;s &quot;only completed work of uncompromising plasticity and continuity&quot;, a claim with which Wright&#x27;s biographer Robert C. Twombly agreed. Critics came to regard the Guggenheim as the best work of Wright&#x27;s later career, as well as a culmination of the helical shapes that Wright had used in his designs since 1925. Spiro Kostof called the museum &quot;a gift of pure architecture&quot;, and Edgar Kaufmann Jr. said the building was &quot;one of the irrefutably grand achievements of modern architecture&quot;.

The museum building inspired other architects&#x27; designs. Several similar buildings were developed in the 1960s, although they generally used less concrete than the Guggenheim did. Deborah Solomon of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; wrote in 2002 that the Guggenheim inspired the phenomenon of &quot;the museum that is just walls&quot;, wherein museums competed for the best-designed buildings. The building was also depicted in a two-cent postage stamp issued in Wright&#x27;s honor in 1966. The American Institute of Architects&#x27; 2007 survey &quot;List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot; ranked the Guggenheim Museum among the top 150 buildings in the United States.

== Attendance ==
When the building opened, it was popular with the general public. A 1960 Gallup poll found that 38 percent of visitors came for the building itself, while an additional 43 percent wanted to see both the building and the art. The Guggenheim did not keep precise attendance records until 1992. Before its 1990s renovation, it had an estimated 600,000 annual visitors. This increased to between 900,000 and 1 million by the early 2000s. It had 960,000 annual visitors before the September 11 attacks, but attendance decreased after the attacks; it recovered several years later. In 2013, nearly 1.2 million people visited the museum, and its James Turrell exhibition was the most popular in New York City in daily attendance. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Guggenheim had only 154,000 visitors in 2020, an 88 percent decrease from the preceding year. , the museum had 861,000 visitors, compared with 1.2 million in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic).

According to museum officials, surveys over the years have indicated that most visitors came because of the building&#x27;s architecture rather than its artwork. In 2001, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that nearly 70 percent were tourists and that half were foreigners. In 2010, the &quot;Times&quot; reported that 55–65 percent of visitors were from the New York metropolitan area. According to a 2018 study, 73 percent of the museum&#x27;s visitors were white and 8 percent were black.

In 2009, a Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective attracted 372,000 visitors in three months, becoming the museum&#x27;s single most popular exhibit. This record was broken the next year by a Kandinsky exhibit. , the most popular exhibition in the museum&#x27;s history was a 2019 exhibition of Hilma af Klint paintings, which attracted over 600,000 visitors in six months.

<text>Les Baux-de-Provence (; &quot;Les Baux of Provence&quot;; Provençal: &quot;Lei Bauç de Provença&quot; or &quot;Li Baus de Prouvènço&quot; ), commonly referred to simply as Les Baux, is a rural commune in the Bouches-du-Rhône department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region in Southern France.

It is located in the Alpilles mountains, northeast of Arles, atop a rocky outcrop that is crowned with a ruined castle overlooking the plains to the south. Its name refers to its site: in Provençal, &quot;bauç&quot; is a rocky spur. From the village name the word &quot;bauxite&quot; was coined for aluminium ore when first discovered there by geologist Pierre Berthier in 1821. Until 13 August 1958, the commune was officially named Les Baux.

Renamed after the historical province of Provence, it is a member of Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (The Most Beautiful Villages of France) Association and has over 1.5 million visitors per year although it has only about 20 residents in the upper part of the commune and 315 (as of 2020) for the whole commune. Inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Baussencs&quot; (masculine) and &quot;Baussenques&quot; (feminine) in French. The commune is part of Alpilles Regional Natural Park.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The defensive capabilities of Les Baux have always made it an attractive location for human habitation. Traces of habitation have been found and dated to 6000 BC. in the Costapéra cave which was discovered in 1928 and which houses a collective burial ground from the early Bronze Age. The site was used by the Celts as a fort or oppidum around the 2nd century BC. Peripheral areas or &quot;castrum&quot; developed very early as evidenced by the &quot;Trémaïé&quot;. The way from the Les Baux oppidum to the plains north of the Alpilles was by a protohistoric way through the valley of Laval and the town of Glanon which later took the name Glanum.

===Antiquity===

While Protohistory was strongly marked by pastoralism and agriculture in the Alpilles, limestone was also extracted from quarries around Les Baux where a workshop from the end of the 2nd and early 1st centuries BC has been found. In the second part of the Iron Age (7th to 6th centuries. BC), the population was sedentary and began to build durable houses. The castrum was structured like a village with its streets and houses. The process of permanent construction was in parallel with the intensification of economic exchanges with Mediterranean traders. In exchange for luxury goods, the inhabitants of the Alpilles produced grain and achieved a state of autarky with a real trading economy. Over the following centuries the population of the Alpilles consistently decreased: the Greek colony at Arles attracted many people from across the region.

===Middle Ages===
In the Middle Ages the area became the stronghold of a feudal domain covering 79 towns and villages. The fortress was built from the 11th to the 13th century over seven hectares. The princes of Les Baux controlled Provence for many years and they gained a formidable reputation. They were said to be descended from the Biblical Magi Balthazar and their coat of arms was a silver star with sixteen branches as a reminder that, according to the Gospel, it guided the three wise men to Bethlehem. Their motto was: &quot;Au hasard, Balthazar&quot; (&quot;To chance, Balthazar&quot;).

As a medieval stronghold on the borders of Languedoc, Comtat Venaissin and Provence, the fortress had a turbulent military history and has been the subject of many assaults. The solid dungeon that still dominates the village today reiterates the importance of this castle which was a desirable possession in the Middle Ages.

At the end of the Baussenque Wars in the 12th century the princes of Les Baux were defeated. The large castle began to be renowned for its highly cultivated court and chivalrous conduct. The estate finally came to an end in the 15th century after the death of the last princess of Les Baux.

The death of Queen Joanna I of Naples led to a crisis of succession to the County of Provence. The cities of the Aix Union (1382–1387) supported Charles, Duke of Durazzo, against Louis I, Duke of Anjou. The King of France, Charles VI, intervened and sent the Seneschal of Beaucaire, Enguerrand d&#x27;Eudin, who rallied Guillaume III Roger de Beaufort. Les Baux, the possession of the Roger, was thus neutral at the beginning of war and on the Angevin side at the end of the decade.

===Late Middle Ages===

Les Baux, together with Provence, was then attached to the crown of France. Under the rule of the Manville family, the village became a center of Protestantism and even tried a rebellion against the crown. In 1631, tired of conflict, the people negotiated with the king for the redemption of the castle territory and the right to dismantle the fortifications, &quot;which were a refuge for rebels&quot;. Louis XIII consented on 5 August.

In 1642 the town was offered to the Grimaldi family as a marquisate in favour of Hercule de Grimaldi, Prince of Monaco (1642–1780). The title &quot;Marquis of Les Baux&quot; is still carried by the Prince of Monaco. Administratively, the town is entirely French and the title of Marquis of Les Baux is traditionally given to the heir to the throne of Monaco. Jacques, the son of the current Prince of Monaco Albert II, carries among his many titles that of Marquis of Les Baux.

===Modern Period===
In 1822 bauxite was discovered in the area by geologist Pierre Berthier. The ore was intensively mined until its exhaustion at the end of the 20th century.

==Geography==

Les Baux-de-Provence is located in the foothills of the Alpilles in the &quot;Parc naturel régional des Alpilles&quot; some 22 kilometers south of Avignon and 15 kilometers northeast of Arles. Access to the commune is by the D27 road from Maussane-les-Alpilles in the south which passes through the village and continues north to join the D99 east of Mas-Blanc-des-Alpilles. The D5 also comes from Maussane-les-Alpilles in the south and passes through the east of the commune as it goes north to Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. The D27A links the two roads in the commune. The D78F branches from the D27 in the commune and goes south-west to join the D17 west of Paradou. Apart from the village there are the hamlets of Mes de Mai, Carita and Manville. The commune is farmland in the southeast and forested hills in the rest.

The commune is traversed by numerous streams which are called &quot;gaudres&quot;. A gaudre (from the Provençal &quot;gaudre&quot; meaning &quot;small stream&quot;) refers to a river often dry in summer and with low flow the rest of the year. The main gaudres in the commune are the Gaudre de Valmouriane with numerous tributaries flowing north to join the Canal du Vigueirat north of Mas-Blanc-des-Alpilles. The Gaudre du Mas de Chevrier also with numerous tributaries flows west to join the Gaudre d&#x27;Auge west of the commune. The Gaudre d&#x27;Entreconque flows from the northeast to south to join the Gaudre de la Foux which continues south to join the Canal des Pompes south of Maussane-les-Alpilles.

===Climate===
The climate in Les Baux-de-Provence, as in the rest of the Alpilles, is considered Mediterranean. The winters are mild and dry and summers hot and dry. The average maximum temperature is in July and August (29 °C) with the lowest average minimum temperature in December and January (+ 3 °C). The wettest month is January with an average of 7 days of rain against two days in July. The Alpilles region receives more rainfall than the shores of the Mediterranean: 500 mm / year in Camargue against 600 to 700 mm / year in Les Baux. Major frosts are rare and were more frequent in the 19th century as evidenced by repeated freezing of the Rhône which has been virtually unknown since then.

The mistral violently blows from the north or north-west especially in winter and spring. The Alpilles deflect the wind but it blows in Les Baux almost as strongly as in the north of the chain. The mistral blows strongly 100 days a year on average and less strongly on 83 days leaving only 182 days a year without wind. There are two types of mistral: the &quot;white mistral&quot; on clear days and the &quot;black mistral&quot;, rarer, which is accompanied by rain.

===Flora and fauna===
The flora in the commune is mainly xerophytic and Mediterranean Phytochorion. The botanist Bernard Girerd counted 800 plant species in 1992. Apart from the olive tree, characteristic of a maussanais landscape, there are also hackberries, small sized Kermes oak, and Shadbush. Protected plant species, such as the summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum) and Hélianthème (Helianthemum lavandulaefolium), are found at the bottom of the valleys.

Many animal species nest in the Alpilles and can be seen in the commune. The most famous is the Bonelli&#x27;s eagle, a protected species, as well as the Egyptian vulture, the lesser kestrel, and the Eurasian eagle-owl. The arid rocks are home to a species of lizard emblematic of the Alpilles: the ocellated lizard which is also considered threatened and protected.

There are many mammals in the commune, especially in the valleys. Wild boar abounds and its population is growing. Conversely, the number of hares and rabbits have tended to decrease. The reason seems to be the outbreak of myxomatosis in 1953 that caused havoc in the population, and, since the end of the 20th century, Rabbit haemorrhagic disease causing the decline of the species. The scarcity of these animals could pose longer-term problems for the survival of species of birds of prey that feed on them.
==Economy==
===Olive growing sector===

The commune produces &quot;Olive oil of the valley of Les Baux-de-Provence&quot; which is protected by the &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) by a decree issued by INAO on 27 August 1997. The olive varieties that go into its preparation are: Salonenque, Béruguette, Grossane, and Verdale of Bouches-du-Rhône. Crushed olives and black olives are also produced that fall under the INAO decree. The varieties of crushed olives broken are Salonenque and Béruguette. For black olives only the variety Grossane is acceptable.

===Wine production===
The commune is classified AOC for its Coteaux-des-Baux-en-Provence wines. This AOC was created by decree on 20 April 1995 for red and rosé wines. They were first classified VDQS by an order of 23 January 1956 for &quot;Coteaux-d&#x27;Aix-en-Provence&quot;. A second decree dated 24 December 1985 allowed the use of the generic name &quot;Les Baux&quot; recognizing the specific identity of the vineyards of the Les Baux region covering seven communes in the Alpilles. Production is 15,500 hectolitres per year: 75% red and 25% rosé.

==Culture==

Christmas at Les Baux in the Church of Saint Vincent is held on Christmas Eve during midnight mass. This is primarily a live nativity scene, which takes place before the pastorage ritual developed in the pastoral world and dating back to the 16th century. This traditional ceremony was abandoned during the 19th century but was revived in 1902: a cart pulled by a ram, decorated with leaves and candles, brings a newborn lamb. Each shepherd, in turn, kisses the feet of the child Jesus then passes the lamb hand to hand before giving an offering.

Carrières de Lumières, established in 1976 as the Cathédrale d&#x27;Images, is a permanent show in which large bright images are projected on the stone walls of huge galleries dug into the rock of the Val d&#x27;Enfer on the road to Maillane. The wall surface used extends over 4,000 m2. Cathédrale d&#x27;Images is a fairy and giant slide show in the dark projected on the limestone walls of the quarry where the viewer is immersed in a visual and musical universe. Despite its success, the Cathédrale d&#x27;images had to stop its activities in Les Baux-de-Provence at the end of 2010 after refusing a Public Service Delegation. The municipal council then entrusted the management of the site to the &quot;Culturespaces&quot; company who operate under the name of Carrières de Lumières.

=== Exhibitions ===

In 2019, Stefan Szczesny exhibited in the whole village of Les Baux-de-Provence. The German artist, living in Saint-Tropez showed about 30 of his monumental &quot;shadow sculptures&quot; as well as glass sculptures from Murano, ceramics and paintings.

<doc id="104936" wikidata="Q52932" url="?curid=104936" title="Frederick I of Sweden">
<text>Frederick I (; 28 April 1676 – 5 April 1751) was King of Sweden from 1720 until his death, having been prince consort of Sweden from 1718 to 1720, and was also Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel from 1730. He ascended the throne following the death of his brother-in-law absolutist Charles XII in the Great Northern War, and the abdication of his wife, Charles&#x27;s sister and successor Ulrika Eleonora, after she had to relinquish most powers to the Riksdag of the Estates and thus chose to abdicate. His powerless reign and lack of legitimate heirs of his own saw his family&#x27;s elimination from the line of succession after the parliamentary government dominated by pro-revanchist Hat Party politicians ventured into a war with Russia, which ended in defeat and the Russian tsarina Elizabeth getting Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp instated following the death of the king. Whilst being the only Swedish monarch called Frederick, he was Frederick I of Hesse-Kassel and thus Frederick I also of Sweden, though other Swedish monarchs with non-repeating names (such as Birger, Sigismund and Frederick&#x27;s successor: Adolf Frederick) had not been enumerated.

==Early life==
He was the son of Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, and Princess Maria Amalia of Courland. In 1692 the young prince made his Grand Tour to the Dutch Republic, in 1695 to the Italian Peninsula and later he studied in Geneva. After this he had a military career, leading the Hessian troops as Lieutenant General in the War of the Spanish Succession on the side of the Dutch. He was defeated in 1703 in the Battle of Speyerbach, but participated the next year in the great victory in the Battle of Blenheim. In 1706 he was again defeated by the French in the Battle of Castiglione. At the Battle of Malplaquet in 1709 he commanded the Dutch cavalry. In 1712, in absence of Count Tilly, he assumed the command of the Dutch army. Both in 1716 and 1718 he joined the campaign of Charles XII of Sweden against Norway, and was appointed Swedish Generalissimus.

==Prince consort of Sweden==
He married his second wife, Princess Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden, in 1715. He was then granted the title Prince of Sweden, with the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, by the estates, and was prince consort there during Ulrika Eleonora&#x27;s rule as queen regnant from 1718 until her abdication in 1720. He is the only Swedish prince consort there has been to date. Frederick I had much influence during the reign of his spouse.

Some historians have suggested that the bullet which killed his brother-in-law Charles XII of Sweden in 1718 was actually fired by Frederick&#x27;s aide André Sicre. Charles had been an authoritarian and demanding ruler; one reason the Swedish Estates elected Frederick was because he was taken to be fairly weak, which indeed he turned out to be.

==King of Sweden==
Frederick succeeded Ulrika Eleonora on the throne upon her abdication in his favor in 1720, elected by the Swedish Estates.

The defeats suffered by Charles XII in the Great Northern War ended Sweden&#x27;s position as a first-rank European power. Under Frederick, this had to be accepted. Sweden also had to cede Estonia, Ingria and Livonia to Russia in the Treaty of Nystad, in 1721.

Frederick I was a very active and dynamic king at the beginning of his 31-year reign. But after the aristocracy had regained power during the wars with Russia, he became not so much powerless as uninterested in affairs of state. In 1723, he tried to strengthen royal authority, but after he failed, he never had much to do with politics. He did not even sign official documents; instead a stamp of his signature was used. He devoted most of his time to hunting and love affairs. His marriage to Queen Ulrika Eleonora was childless, but he had several children by his mistress, Hedvig Taube.

In 1723 Frederick rewarded the military inventor Sven Åderman with the estate of Halltorps on the island of Öland, for improving the rate of fire of the musket.

As a king, he was not very respected. When he was crowned, it was said of him: &quot;King Charles we recently buried, King Frederick we crown – suddenly the clock has now passed from twelve to one&quot;. It is said about him, that although a lot of great achievements in the country&#x27;s development happened during his reign, he never had anything to do with them himself. When he died, Carl Gustaf Tessin said about him:Under the reign of King Frederick, science has developed – he never bothered to read a book. The merchant business has flourished – he has never encouraged it with a single coin. The Stockholm Palace has been built – he has never been curious enough to look at it.Neither did he have anything to do with the founding of the first Swedish speaking theater at Bollhuset during his reign. One of his few important policies was the banning of duels.

On 23 February 1748 Frederick I instituted the three Swedish royal orders of the Seraphim, of the Sword and of the North Star, the three principal Swedish orders of chivalry.

==Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel==
Frederick became Landgrave of Hesse only in 1730, ten years after becoming King of Sweden. He immediately appointed his younger brother William governor of Hesse.

As Landgrave, Frederick is generally not seen as a success. Indeed, he did concentrate more on Sweden, and due to his negotiated, compromise-like ascension to the throne there, he and his court had a very low income. The money for that very expensive court, then, since the 1730s came from wealthy Hesse, and this means that Frederick essentially behaved like an absentee landlord and drained Hessian resources to finance life in Sweden. Also, Frederick&#x27;s father, Charles I of Hesse-Kassel, had been the state&#x27;s most successful ruler, rebuilding the state over his decades-long rule by means of economic and infrastructure measures and state reform, as well as tolerance, such as attracting, for economic purposes, the French Huguenots. His brother the governor, who would succeed Frederick as Landgrave William VIII of Hesse-Kassel, though by background a distinguished soldier, was likewise a great success locally. There are very few physical remainders of Frederick in Hesse today; one of them is his large Royal Swedish paraph (FR) over the old door of the University of Marburg&#x27;s former riding hall, now the Institute of Physical Education.

==Ancestry==
==Family and issue==
On 31 May 1700, he married his first wife, Luise Dorothea, Princess of Prussia (1680–1705), daughter of Frederick I of Prussia (1657–1713) and Elisabeth Henriette of Hesse-Kassel (1661–1683). Luise Dorothea died in childbirth in December 1705.

His second wife, whom he married in 1715, was Ulrika Eleonora, Princess of Sweden (1688–1741), daughter of Charles XI of Sweden (1655–1697) and of Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark (1656–1693). Ulrika suffered two miscarriages, one in 1715 and another in 1718, after which there are no further recorded pregnancies.

Frederick I had three extramarital children with his mistress Hedvig Taube:
* Frederick William von Hessenstein (1735–1808).
* Charles Edward von Hessenstein (1737–1769).
* Hedwig Amalia von Hessenstein (1743–1752).

After the death of Hedvig Taube, his official mistress was the noblewoman Catharina Ebba Horn (1720–1781), whom he gave the title and recognition of Countess (from 1745).

Thus, the Hessian line in Sweden ended with him and was followed by that of Holstein-Gottorp. In Hesse-Kassel, he was succeeded by his younger brother William VIII, a famous general.

<doc id="104937" wikidata="Q427529" url="?curid=104937" title="Taxi (TV series)">
<text>Taxi is an American television sitcom that originally aired on ABC from September 12, 1978, to May 6, 1982, and on NBC from September 30, 1982, to June 15, 1983. It focuses on the everyday lives of a handful of New York City taxi drivers and their abusive dispatcher. For most of the run of the show, the ensemble cast consisted of taxi drivers Alex Reiger (Judd Hirsch), Bobby Wheeler (Jeff Conaway), Elaine Nardo (Marilu Henner), Tony Banta (Tony Danza), and &quot;Reverend&quot; Jim Ignatowski (Christopher Lloyd), along with dispatcher Louie De Palma (Danny DeVito) and mechanic Latka Gravas (Andy Kaufman). &quot;Taxi&quot; was produced by the John Charles Walters Company, in association with Paramount Network Television, and was created by James L. Brooks, Stan Daniels, David Davis, and Ed. Weinberger, all of whom were brought on board after working on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (which ended in 1977).

The show was a critical and commercial success and is widely regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time. It was nominated for 34 Primetime Emmy Awards and won 18, including wins in three consecutive years for Outstanding Comedy Series. It has remained in syndicated reruns ever since the series ended.

==Premise and themes==
The show focuses on the employees who work the night shift at the fictional Sunshine Cab Company, and its principal setting is the company&#x27;s fleet garage in Manhattan. Among the drivers, only Alex Reiger, who is disillusioned with life, considers cab driving his profession. The others view it as a temporary/part time/side job.

Elaine Nardo is a single mother working as a receptionist at an art gallery. Tony Banta is a boxer with a losing record. Bobby Wheeler is a struggling actor. John Burns (written out of the show after the first season) is working his way through college. All take pity on &quot;Reverend Jim&quot; Ignatowski, an aging hippie minister who is burnt out from drugs, so they help him become a cabbie. The characters also include Latka Gravas, their innocent, wide-eyed mechanic from an unnamed foreign country, and Louie De Palma, the despotic dispatcher.

A number of episodes involve a character having an opportunity to realize their dream to move up in the world, only to see it yanked away. Otherwise, the cabbies deal on a daily basis with their unsatisfying lives and with Louie&#x27;s abusive behavior and contempt (despite being a former cab driver himself). Louie&#x27;s assistant, Jeff Bennett, is rarely heard from at first, but his role increased in later seasons.

Despite the humor of the show, &quot;Taxi&quot; often tackles such dramatic life issues as drug addiction, single parenthood, blindness, obesity, dissociative identity disorder, animal abuse, homosexuality, racism, teenage runaways, divorce, nuclear war, sexual harassment, premenstrual mood disorders, gambling addiction, and grief.

== Cast and characters ==
===Main===



* Alex Reiger (Judd Hirsch) – Alex is the main protagonist in the sitcom, the compassionate, level-headed core of the show; the one everyone else turns to for advice. At one point, he reveals his anxiety with this unwanted burden. He once worked in an office, with a good chance of advancement, but lost this job owing to his refusal to follow the company line. He was married to Phyllis Bornstein (Louise Lasser), and when she divorced him because of his lack of ambition she sought sole custody of their baby daughter, Cathy (Talia Balsam). He gave in rather than fight it. He is estranged from his lothario father, Joe (Jack Gilford), but has a closer relationship with his sister, Charlotte (Joan Hackett). Alex is a recovered compulsive gambler, although he relapses in one episode. A deadpan cynic, he has resigned himself to driving a cab for the rest of his life. 
* Robert L. &quot;Bobby&quot; Wheeler (Jeff Conaway) (1978–1981, recurring 1981–1982) – Bobby is a vain, struggling actor who is Louie&#x27;s favorite target for scorn and abuse. Robin Williams was considered for the role, but he was already committed to &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;. Success as an actor eludes Bobby. He is signed by a famous manager, but it turns out she only wants him as a lover, not a client. Later he is cast in the pilot for a soap opera, but his part is recast when the series goes into production. Conaway left the show at the beginning of season 4, returning for a guest appearance in which his character leaves the taxi company for good. Writer Sam Simon explained later that when Conaway was absent for an episode, his dialogue was successfully reassigned to other cast members, which made the producers realize that he was expendable.
* Louie De Palma (Danny DeVito) – Louie is the main antagonist of the sitcom. The head dispatcher of the Sunshine Cab Company and supervisor to the cab drivers, Louie spends his time holding court inside the caged-in dispatch office at the garage, arguing with, belittling and bullying the drivers. He not only lacks morals, he is openly proud of his misdemeanors and outright crimes. Louie will do anything to benefit himself, from taking advantage of a drunken friend of his on-again, off-again girlfriend Zena Sherman (played by DeVito&#x27;s real-life wife Rhea Perlman), to gambling with a young boy, to stealing from the company, to spying on Elaine while she is changing. He lives with his mother (DeVito&#x27;s real mother, Julia, in two episodes). On some occasions he helps his workers, as in the episode in which a cruel hairstylist (played by Ted Danson) gives Elaine a garish makeover just before a very important event, it is Louie who bolsters her confidence to confront him. Louie is very superstitious, in one episode exhibiting great concern when Jim has a premonition that Alex is going to die later that night. In 1999, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked De Palma first on its list of the 50 greatest TV characters of all time.
* Elaine O&#x27;Connor Nardo (Marilu Henner) – Elaine is a divorced mother of two, struggling to cope while trying to realize her ambitions in the field of fine art. Elaine works as a part time cab driver as a moonlighting job while she works as a receptionist in an art gallery. Also Louie&#x27;s object of lust, she is attracted to characters played by actors ranging from Tom Selleck to Wallace Shawn. The last name for the character was taken from Patricia Nardo, a scriptwriter, former secretary, and close friend of &quot;Taxi&quot; co-creator James L. Brooks.
* Anthony Mark &quot;Tony&quot; Banta (Tony Danza) – The kind-hearted, slow-witted Vietnam veteran and boxer has little success in the sport (in one episode Banta gives his record as 8 wins, 24 losses and he has been knocked out 14 times). In fact, Louie makes a lot of money betting against him (when Banta makes a conscious decision to throw a fight, Louie decides to bet &quot;on&quot; Banta because the only way Banta can remain a loser in such a situation is to &quot;win&quot;). Finally, the boxing commission takes away his license because he has been knocked out one too many times.Tony got his boxing license reinstated. In the final season, Tony is introduced to new girlfriend Vicki (Anne De Salvo) by Simka. He and Vicki have a falling out after she becomes pregnant by him, but reconcile and get married. The last name for the character was taken from Gloria Banta, a scriptwriter and close friend of &quot;Taxi&quot; co-creator James L. Brooks.
* Reverend Jim Ignatowski (Christopher Lloyd) (guest star 1978, main cast 1979–1983) – A washed-up figure of the 1960s, Jim lives in a world of his own. He was once a diligent, mature student at Harvard University, with an extremely wealthy father (Victor Buono), but one bite of a drug-laden brownie was enough to get him hooked and send him into a downward spiral. His real last name had been Caldwell; he changed it to Ignatowski, thinking that the backward pronunciation of that name was &quot;Star Child&quot;. In a particularly memorable episode, “Reverend Jim: A Space Odyssey”, the cabbies help him pass a written exam to become one of them. He occasionally exhibits unexpected talents, such as the ability to play the piano masterfully (much to his own surprise). &quot;TV Guide&quot; placed Ignatowski 32nd on its list of the 50 greatest TV characters.
* Latka Gravas (Andy Kaufman) – Latka is an immigrant from a strange foreign land, often speaking in his foreign tongue (actually gibberish, often with invented phrases such as &quot;ibi da&quot; or &quot;nik nik&quot;), but when speaking English he speaks with a very heavy accent. He works as a mechanic, fixing the taxis. Latka was an adaptation of Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Man&quot; character, which he originated in his stage act. In this act, &quot;Foreign Man&quot; claimed to be from the fictional island of Caspiar in the Caspian Sea. Kaufman, feeling that he had lost creative control over the character he had created, eventually grew tired of the gag, leading the writers to give Latka multiple personality disorder. This allowed Kaufman to play other characters, the most frequent being a repellent, smooth-talking lounge-lizard persona calling himself Vic Ferrari. In one episode, Latka becomes Alex, with profound insights into &quot;his&quot; life. Just as he is about to reveal to the real Alex the perfect solution for all his problems, he reverts to Latka.
* Simka Dahblitz-Gravas (Carol Kane) (recurring 1980–1982, starring 1982–1983) – She is from the same country as Latka. They belong to different ethnic groups which traditionally detest each other, but they fall in love and eventually marry. She is much more assertive than her husband, often standing up to Louie on his behalf. 
* John Burns (Randall Carver) (1978–1979) – The naive young man works as a cabbie to pay for college, where he is working towards a degree in forestry. According to Carver, &quot;the characters of John Burns and Tony Banta were too similar... some of the lines were almost interchangeable&quot;, so he was dropped after the first season without explanation. The premiere episode, &quot;Like Father, Like Daughter&quot;, established that John started working for the cab company after he was a passenger in Alex&#x27;s cab. John did not have change, so he had to ride with Alex to the garage to pay him. Once there, he started hanging around and eventually applied for a job. In the episode &quot;The Great Line&quot;, he spontaneously marries a complete stranger named Suzanne.

===Recurring===

* Jeff Bennett (J. Alan Thomas), Sunshine Cab&#x27;s assistant dispatcher, he shares the &quot;cage&quot; with Louie but rarely speaks or interacts with the other characters. A quiet African-American man with an afro, Jeff appears throughout the show&#x27;s run, initially as a bit part player and/or background performer. As the series progressed, Jeff gradually became more of a featured supporting player; his evolution culminated in a storyline in the season 5 episode &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, in which Louie falsely accuses Jeff of stealing car parts from the company and selling them on the black market—a crime which Louie himself committed. Thomas appeared as himself in the 1999 film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;.
* Tommy Jeffries (T.J. Castronova), the bartender and waiter at Mario&#x27;s, the restaurant where the group often hangs out. Tommy is pretty friendly with the whole gang, taking an interest in their personal lives.
* Joe Reiger (Jack Gilford) (1979–1981), Alex&#x27;s father, from whom he is estranged. In his first appearance, he suffers a heart attack and Alex is convinced by his sister Charlotte (Joan Hackett) to visit him in the hospital. Alex and Joe had not spoken in 30 years, and Alex mistakes another patient for Joe.
* Zena Sherman (Rhea Perlman) (1979–1982). She has a romantic relationship with Louie (played by Perlman&#x27;s real-life husband DeVito), but marries someone else after they break up.
* Greta Gravas (Susan Kellermann) (1979–1982), Latka&#x27;s mother. She has a short fling with Alex, which causes friction with Latka.
* Phyllis Bornstein-Consuelos (Louise Lasser) (1980–1982), Alex&#x27;s ex-wife, with whom he had a daughter. Phyllis became fed up with his lack of ambition and remarried, but they remain strongly attracted to each other. She once goes out on a date with Louie, just to irritate Alex.
* Cathy (Talia Balsam) (1978–1980), Phyllis and Alex&#x27;s daughter. In the first episode of the series, Alex finds out that Cathy, who was a baby when he and Phyllis divorced, is making a stopover in Miami on her way to attend college in Portugal. He drives to Miami to meet her for the first time since then. In a later episode, he attends Cathy&#x27;s wedding.
* Brian Sims (Marc Anthony Danza). In his first appearance, Tony fights a former boxing champ whose best days are behind him. He becomes troubled when he realizes that the champ is dedicating the fight to wheelchair user Brian (played by Danza&#x27;s real-life son). In a next-season episode, Tony seeks to adopt him.

===Guests===

Among the many guest stars, Ruth Gordon won an Emmy Award for her guest portrayal of Dee Wilcox in &quot;Sugar Mama&quot; (1979), and Eileen Brennan was nominated for an Emmy for her guest portrayal of Mrs. McKenzie in &quot;Thy Boss&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1981). 

Some played themselves: actresses Marcia Wallace and Penny Marshall, psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, cookie entrepreneur Wally &quot;Famous&quot; Amos, newscasters Edwin Newman and Eric Sevareid (the latter in a fantasy sequence), and ring announcer Jimmy Lennon. WBC world welterweight boxing champion Carlos Palomino appeared in the first-season episode &quot;One-Punch Banta&quot; as himself. Palomino accidentally punched Danza in the face during a brief fight scene. Martial artist and professional wrestler Gene LeBell played himself in multiple episodes as the referee for Banta&#x27;s boxing matches.

George Wendt and Ted Danson, who appeared in separate episodes, went on to star in primary &quot;Taxi&quot; director Jim Burrows&#x27; next series, &quot;Cheers&quot;, as did recurring &quot;Taxi&quot; performer Rhea Perlman. Tom Selleck and Mandy Patinkin had memorable guest appearances, each as one of the memorable fares of Cab 804 (in &quot;Memories of Cab 804: Part 2&quot;), while Tom Hanks portrayed Reverend Jim&#x27;s college roommate in the flashback episode &quot;The Road Not Taken, Part 1&quot;. Allan Arbus, who portrayed US Army psychiatrist Dr. Sidney Freedman in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, played his manager in the episode. Football player-turned-actor Bubba Smith appeared in one episode. In the episode &quot;Jim Joins the Network&quot;, Martin Short played a failing TV network executive who takes advantage of Jim&#x27;s exceptional ability to schedule shows for his own career advancement.

==Episodes==

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;Taxi&quot; is one of television&#x27;s most lauded shows. During its run, the sitcom was nominated for 31 Emmy Awards and won 18, including three for Outstanding Comedy Series. It was also nominated for 25 Golden Globes, with four wins (three for Best TV Series – Musical/Comedy). In 1979, it received the Humanitas Prize in the 30 minute category. It was also ranked 48th in TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 1997, two of the show&#x27;s episodes, &quot;Latka the Playboy&quot; and &quot;Reverend Jim: A Space Odyssey&quot; were respectively ranked #19 and #63 on TV Guide&#x27;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. In 2013, the series was ranked #35 on TV Guide&#x27;s 60 Best Series of All Time and #19 by the Writers Guild of America on their list of the 101 Best Written TV Series. In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;Taxi&quot; #75 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.


==Production==
&quot;Taxi&quot; was inspired by the non-fiction article &quot;Night-Shifting for the Hip Fleet&quot; by Mark Jacobson, which appeared in the September 22, 1975, issue of &quot;New York&quot; magazine. This article helped suggest the idea for the show to James L. Brooks and David Davis, though nothing from the article was used directly. The article was a profile of several drivers who worked the night shift for a New York cab company.

The series was produced on Stage 23 at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, California, from July 5, 1978, to February 18, 1983.

When the series was cancelled by ABC, it seemed for a time that the premium cable television network HBO would pick up the series. When it did not, the series was picked up by NBC, which at first kept it on at its ABC time slot of Thursday 9:30 p.m following the first season of &quot;Cheers&quot;. An NBC promo for &quot;Taxi&quot;″s move to the network featured Danny DeVito in character as Louie saying &quot;Same time, better station!&quot;

The taxicabs shown in the show are Checker A11s.

==Opening and closing sequence==
The opening titles show a Checker cab driving east across the Queensboro Bridge. The footage originally was intended as a &quot;bridge&quot; between scenes and is only about fifteen seconds long; parts of it are repeated to fill the opening. Driving the vehicle is cast member Tony Danza. The closing version consisted of Cab 804, the drivers&#x27; favorite cab (&quot;Memories of Cab 804&quot;), driving into the night.

===Theme music===
Bob James wrote the opening theme, &quot;Angela&quot;, which had been intended for a sequence in episode #3 (&quot;Blind Date&quot;). The producers liked this slower, more melancholic tune better than the up-tempo opening theme they had originally chosen (&quot;Touchdown&quot;), and were able to make the switch before the first episode aired. Both songs are on James&#x27;s 1978 album, &quot;Touchdown&quot;.

It uses the &quot;Sunny&quot; chord progression.

In 1983, James released &quot;The Genie&quot;, an LP containing much of the incidental music he had written for &quot;Taxi&quot; during its run.

==Syndication==
Reruns of &quot;Taxi&quot; began airing in syndication in 1983 on 64 television stations immediately after NBC&#x27;s cancelation; It has been airing in syndication since. The program also aired on Nick at Nite from 1994 to 2001. &quot;Taxi&quot; previously aired reruns Sunday nights on MeTV as part of their &quot;Last Laughs&quot; block. Hulu, Pluto TV and Amazon Prime Video have all five seasons; however, as of February 2023, only Paramount+ has every episode, including some available with original music for the first time outside of the original and syndicated runs.
In the UK, &quot;Taxi&quot; aired on BBC1 with repeats airing on Paramount Comedy 2 and CBS Drama. As of 2020, the series has been airing weeknights on Decades (later rebranded as Catchy Comedy) as part of its “Smartcoms Across The Decades” block (later re-named as the &quot;Smart and Catchy Sitcoms&quot; block). &quot;Taxi&quot; has also aired on Decades and Catchy Comedy as a &quot;Weekend Binge&quot; and a &quot;Catchy Binge&quot;, respectively, most recently on June 10–11, 2023.

==Cast reunions==
Danny DeVito hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (on NBC) soon after &quot;Taxi&quot; was canceled after the fourth season. During the opening monologue, DeVito read a letter supposedly from his mother asking God to forgive ABC for cancelling the show, adding that &quot;but I&#x27;ll understand if you don&#x27;t.&quot; A filmed bit had him driving around New York looking morose until inspiration strikes, and he blows up the ABC building. In addition, the &quot;Taxi&quot; cast members were given an opportunity for closure, which up to that point had been denied for them due to the abrupt cancellation. The actors took their &quot;final&quot; bows during DeVito&#x27;s opening monologue, only to have NBC (which aired &quot;SNL&quot;) pick up the show.

More than 15 years later, most of the cast returned to play their younger-selves and briefly re-enact scenes for the Kaufman biopic &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;. Judd Hirsch, Marilu Henner, Jeff Conaway, Carol Kane, Randall Carver, J. Alan Thomas and Christopher Lloyd all reprised their roles. The only two living members of the principal cast who did not were Danny DeVito, who produced and co-starred in the film as Kaufman&#x27;s manager George Shapiro, and Tony Danza, who at the time of filming was performing in &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; on Broadway.

Several of the cast members (along with cast members from other Judd Hirsch and Bob Newhart vehicles) reunited in different roles for an episode of the Judd Hirsch/Bob Newhart series &quot;George &amp; Leo&quot;.

In January 2009, Danny DeVito mentioned wanting to make a &quot;Taxi&quot; reunion movie.

==Home media==
All five seasons of &quot;Taxi&quot; have been released from Paramount Home Entertainment. The first three seasons of &quot;Taxi&quot; were released on DVD in Region 1 between 2004 and 2005. It took almost four years until Paramount released &quot;The Fourth Season&quot; on September 22, 2009, and &quot;The (Fifth &amp;) Final Season&quot; on December 22, 2009 (the last two seasons were released through CBS Home Entertainment). As of October 2014, all seasons have been released in Germany (Region 2).

On November 11, 2014, CBS Home Entertainment released &quot;Taxi- The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. All 114 episodes are featured on a 17-disc collection.

<doc id="104938" wikidata="Q52933" url="?curid=104938" title="Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden">
<text>Ulrika Eleonora or Ulrica Eleanor (23 January 1688 – 24 November 1741), known as Ulrika Eleonora the Younger, reigned as Queen of Sweden from 5 December 1718 until her abdication on 29 February 1720 in favour of her husband Frederick. Following her husband&#x27;s accession as King Frederick I, Ulrika Eleonora served as his queen consort until her death in 1741.

Ulrika Eleonora was the youngest child of King Charles XI and Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark and named after her mother. In 1715, she married Frederick of Hesse-Kassel. After the death of her brother Charles XII in 1718, Ulrika Eleonora claimed the throne. Her deceased older sister, Hedvig Sophia, had left a son, Charles Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, who had the better claim by primogeniture. Ulrika Eleonora asserted that she was the &quot;closest&quot; surviving relative of the late king (the idea of proximity of blood) and cited the precedent of Queen Christina. She was recognized as successor by the Riksdag after she had agreed to renounce the powers of absolute monarchy established by her father. She abdicated in 1720, at which time her husband became king.

==Princess and regent==

After their mother&#x27;s death in 1693, Ulrika Eleonora and her siblings were placed in the care of their grandmother, Hedwig Eleonora. However, her grandmother was known to favor her elder sister. During her childhood, Eleonora was somewhat overlooked in favor of this elder, more extroverted and talented sister, princess Hedvig Sophia. Her elder siblings enjoyed riding and dancing and reportedly somewhat looked down upon her as she did not have the courage to participate in their games and was easily brought to tears. She was described as friendly, modest and dignified, with good posture and beautiful hands, but she was not regarded as either intelligent or attractive. Her grandmother, Hedwig Eleonora, described her as stubborn, and she was known to demonstrate her dislike of others or of events by simulating illness. She was a talented musician, and when performing with her sister at court concerts, she would play the clavier while her sister sang. Ulrika Eleonora lived most of her life in the shadow of others, outshone by her brother the king, and by her attractive sister.

From 1700, she took care of her dominating grandmother, Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp, during her brother&#x27;s absence in the Great Northern War. Her older sister, Hedvig Sophia, was then the heir presumptive to the throne.
As their brother Charles XII was unmarried and childless, Ulrika Eleonora was regarded as a likely future heir to the throne, and was thereby attractive on the marriage market. In 1698, a marriage alliance was suggested by marrying her to Prince Charles of Denmark and her brother to Princess Sophia Hedwig of Denmark, but in 1700 this plan was discarded. In 1700, there were negotiations of a marriage to Frederick William I of Prussia, but nothing came of them. These plans were about to be put into effect when they were disrupted, without motivation, by her brother. She was later made the god-mother of Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, who was named Ulrika after her.

In 1702, a marriage to the future King George II of Great Britain was suggested, but was postponed, and in the end nothing came of it. Duke John William of Saxe-Gotha was given permission by her brother to court her, but the marriage plans were interrupted after he engaged in a duel with Anders Lagercrona in the presence of the monarch. In 1710, she received a proposal from Prince Frederick of Hesse. The negotiations were handled by her favorite and confidante Emerentia von Düben. The marriage was supported by her grandmother Hedwig Eleonora, as the Queen Dowager thought this would force Ulrika Eleonora to leave Sweden for Hesse, increasing the chances for the son of Ulrika Eleonora&#x27;s elder sister, Hedvig Sophia of Holstein-Gottorp, to become heir to the throne. The engagement was announced on 23 January 1714, and the wedding took place 24 March 1715. During the wedding, her brother Charles XII remarked: &quot;Tonight my sister is dancing away the crown&quot;.

After her grandmother&#x27;s death in 1715, she became the center of the court, and this was one of the happiest periods of her life. In 1715, she married Landgrave Frederick I of Hesse-Kassel. The marriage, which on her side was a love-match, became another attempt to use her as a political puppet. Frederick had married her with the intent of reaching the throne, and immediately began plotting to have her named heir in place of her nephew. The &quot;Hesse Party&quot; and the &quot;Holstein Party&quot; stood against each other in the struggle for the throne.

Ulrika Eleonora&#x27;s situation began to change after the death of her older sister, Hedvig Sophia, in 1708. Ulrika Eleonora became the only adult member of the royal house present in Sweden, aside from her grandmother, Queen Dowager Hedwig Eleonora. Already in late 1712, Charles XII had thoughts of making her regent during his absence. The royal council convinced her to be present at their meetings and give them her support. On 2 November 1713, she appeared at her first session, and a decision was made to assemble the Riksdag to declare her regent in her capacity as the closest heir to the throne. In 1713, the government and her grandmother named her regent during the king&#x27;s absence and thus she became a pawn of the many powers struggling for influence in a country without an official heir presumptive or heir apparent. The choice now stood between Ulrika Eleonora and her nephew. Her accession as regent and president of the parliament was treated with great enthusiasm. The Riksdag had opposed her brother as they wanted to abolish the absolute monarchy and reinstate their own power. As regent, she kept herself informed of state affairs and urged her brother to return, warning him of the effects if he did not. With his permission she signed all documents of state affairs except those written to him personally. However, she regarded herself only as her brother&#x27;s representative, and therefore made no suggestions of her own. As his sister, many times during the war, she had asked her brother if she could visit him, but was never permitted to. She met her brother for the first time after sixteen years in Vadstena in 1716, and after that one last time in Kristinehamn in 1718.

==Queen regnant==
On 5 December 1718, Ulrika Eleonora received the news of the death of her brother, Charles XII. It has never been claimed that she had any advance knowledge of the purported involvement of her husband&#x27;s aide André Sicre, but she did immediately declare herself monarch in Uddevalla by stating that she had inherited the throne. The council was taken by surprise and did not contest this. She took control over the affairs of state and had Georg Heinrich von Görtz and his followers removed from power. The &quot;Hesse Party&quot; secured Ulrika Eleonora&#x27;s succession to the throne. They gained the support of the Riksdag opposition, who wanted to end the absolute monarchy established in 1680 and reinstate parliamentary rule. On 15 December 1718, she declared that though she had inherited the throne, she did not intend to keep the Carolinian absolutism but agreed to reinstate the older system. The war council was determined to abolish absolutism and the right to inherit the throne, but was willing to acknowledge her as an elected monarch. Their opinion was supported by the majority of the Assembly of the Estates. Ulrika Eleonora was forced into agreeing to abolish absolute monarchy and the right to inherit the throne, both for her and for her contestant, her nephew Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. After having agreed to sign the new constitution as monarch, she was elected queen on 23 January 1719. On 19 February she signed the Instrument of Government (1719), thereby securing the support of the Estates not to give the throne to her nephew and competitor. She was crowned in Uppsala Cathedral 17 March 1719 and made her formal entrance into Stockholm as monarch on 11 April that same year. During the ceremonies in Stockholm, she received the Estates, who passed the throne in procession. On this occasion, she demonstrated that she knew who her followers were. When she received the nobility, she only allowed their representatives to kiss her hand with her glove on, while the other representatives were allowed to kiss her hand without the glove. Ulrika Eleonora never made the traditional journey through the country, the &quot;Eriksgata&quot;, on her own. Instead, she made it with Frederick in 1722, after his coronation.

Her reign occurred just before the end of the Great Northern War. During the Russian Pillage of 1719–1721 in August of the summer of 1719, the Russian Fleet attacked the capital of Stockholm. Despite the ongoing attack, Ulrika Eleonora forced her courtiers to attend a previously accepted reception at the British ambassador&#x27;s, &quot;being so untouched as if there had been no enemies present for hundreds of miles&quot;, which was considered to be an impressive act of courage. Her favorite courtier was Emerentia von Düben (1669–1743), her old nurse, who had been ennobled and made lady-in-waiting in 1707 and with whom she had a close relationship all her life. Düben acted as her advisor, her comfort and her support, and was said to not have abused her influence – they were described as sisters. During her short reign, to secure support for her rule, she ennobled many families. In a period of fifteen months, she ennobled 181 people, more than any other monarch in Swedish history; one count, two barons and eight lesser noblemen every month. She had seven field marshals where her brother only ever had between three and five. Ulrika Eleonora was in fact in favour of an absolute monarchy. She had agreed to the new constitution only to secure the throne from her nephew, and her relations with the council were not good. She came into conflict with the president of the Privy Council Arvid Horn, who resigned in protest, as well as with his successor Gustaf Cronhielm. Horn criticized her for discussing state affairs with her husband, pressed her as to whether she would respect the constitution and insulted her by making the remark that nothing better was to be expected &quot;under the regiment of a female.&quot; These conflicts had a deleterious effect on the war and state affairs.

Ulrika Eleonora supported the political ambitions of her consort, and from the beginning, she wished for him to become her co-monarch, in the fashion of William III and Mary II. However, this was not permitted by the Riksdag. One reason being that co-reigning had been forbidden in Sweden since the 15th century. There was also opposition in the Riksdag to the influence of Emerentia von Düben and her siblings over the affairs of state. Her difficulty in respecting the constitution and trouble in getting along with the Riksdag, as well as her way of continuously discussing state affairs with her husband, did however make the Riksdag willing to replace her with Frederick as sole monarch if she abdicated, an idea that had the support of Frederick. On 29 February 1720, after having again been denied a co-monarchy, Ulrika Eleonora abdicated in favour of her husband on the condition that she should succeed him if he should die before her. This condition of her abdication in fact granted her place as the heir to the Swedish throne until her death.

This succession was confirmed by the Riksdag. She often spoke of the abdication as the greatest sacrifice of her life. Frederick succeeded her on 24 March 1720.

==Queen consort==

The reign of her husband began the period traditionally known as the Age of Liberty, when the monarchy lost most of its power to a parliamentary system. As queen consort, she withdrew to private life. Ulrika Eleonora had married for love and was known to be fiercely loyal to Frederick. Initially, the relationship between Ulrika Eleonora and Frederick was described as a happy one, and before Frederick became monarch, he restricted himself to the role of her consort. After two miscarriages in 1715 and 1718 and at least until 1724, the Queen expressed hope that she would give birth to an heir, but ultimately her marriage was childless.
King Frederick suggested placing his brother and his line in the House of Hesse in the succession line, and though this attempt was unsuccessful, Ulrika Eleonora supported this choice rather than her nephew the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp.

Queen Ulrika Eleonora enjoyed great popularity during the reign of her spouse, partly as the last member of the old royal house, and partly because of her personal piety. She was aware that this gave her power to influence policy, and when she let her opinion be known, it was often followed. This influence was recognized. During the Riksdag of 1738, for example, the queen expressed her displeasure when Carl Gustaf Tessin was due to be elected to a post, which resulted in public protests which did not quiet down until Tessin had been received at the Royal Palace and allowed to kiss the bare hand of the queen, who assured him that she had no intention of interfering.

The relationship between Ulrika Eleonora and Frederick changed after he became king, and it was said that when she gave him the crown, she gave him his freedom. King Frederick had mistresses, and his extramarital affairs increased after he lost much of his royal authority in 1723.

In 1734, Frederick became the first king in Swedish history to have an official mistress, the noblewoman Hedvig Taube, who was given the title Countess of Hessenstein. Ulrika Eleonora expressed her disapproval to her close confidant Emerentia von Düben, who convinced her never to display any public reaction to the affair, as it would be beneath the queen&#x27;s dignity and her position was untouchable: &quot;As the Moon travels along its course over the sky without bothering over the barks of dogs, so should Her Majesty despise the gossip, which has been unleashed by this much unfortunate and blinded commitment&quot;. By convincing Ulrika Eleonora not to publicly display her displeasure of his adultery, Emerentia von Düben also became favored by King Frederick. 
Ulrika Eleonora sternly followed the policy of not displaying her feelings about the adultery for years. At the beginning of the affair, on one occasion she even walked publicly with Hedvig Taube in her effort to defend the reputation of her husband.

During the Riksdag of 1738, the question of the king&#x27;s adultery was raised by the clergy estate within the Riksdag of the Estates, and a letter of protest was presented to the king on 3 April 1739. The archbishop had already had a private conversation with the queen about the matter, during which the queen had lamented herself over the king&#x27;s adultery and her disappointment of the Taube family. The clergy estate pointed to the oath made by the king in 1720, when he succeeded the queen on the Swedish throne after she abdicated in his favor, in which he had made the promise to: &quot;love, honor and respect my most worthy consort, the all powerful Princess Ulrica Eleonora [...] and declare the Estates to be free of their oath of allegiance, should I ever break this oath and insurance&quot;, in fact declaring the king deposed if he disrespected the queen. On 26 April, the king expressed a wish to leave for Hesse. He was rumored to plan to settle there permanently with Taube. A rumor circulated of a planned coup d&#x27;etat by the queen&#x27;s followers. The plan was to have the king leave with Taube, leaving the queen as regent of Sweden in his absence. After his departure, the queen&#x27;s followers would present her with proof that the king had secretly married Taube, expecting the queen to respond by considering her marriage dissolved and agree to be reinstated as monarch. This planned coup never took place; the king never presented a request to leave for Hesse.

During the Riksdag of 1740–41, the question was raised again. At this point, a change had occurred in the queen&#x27;s attitude, signs of which were observed already during the Riksdag of 1738. The policy of Ulrika Eleonora not to express her dislike of Frederick&#x27;s adultery was weakened during her last years, possibly due to the unique position of Taube as the official mistress, because of the long-term nature of the affair and because they had children. Another reason for her change of conduct was reportedly that she, as an orthodox Lutheran, was concerned for the king&#x27;s soul. Despite demonstrating her compassion with the other Riksråd deposed during the Riksdag of 1738, she smiled when the misfortune of the father of Hedvig Taube was mentioned. When hosting the wedding of her maid of honour Sigrid Bonde at court, she neglected to invite the Taube, Gylleborg and Sparre families (the last two known supporters of Hedvig Taube), although court protocol would have expected them to be included, and when the new Riksråd Carl Sparre, a known supporter of Taube, was presented to her during the audience for the new members of government, she demonstratively retired, preventing him from kissing her skirt in accordance with protocol. The discontent of Queen Ulrika Eleonora was not a small matter for the Riksdag; not only because of the queen&#x27;s popularity, but also because the queen had abdicated in favour of the king on the condition that she would succeed him if he should die before her, a condition which made the queen the heir to the throne.

During the Riksdag of 1741, the matter of the king&#x27;s adultery was, for the second time, raised in parliament by the clergy estate, this time by Bishop Erik Benzelius, who referred to the matter as that &quot;which the Queen had made it known&quot; that they should raise, in order to &quot;set the mourning heart of the Queen to rest&quot;. An official statement of protest was made, stating a reminder of the king&#x27;s oath always to treat the queen with respect when she abdicated in his favor, and that the whole kingdom was in mourning of the queen&#x27;s sorrow, and concerned for the welfare of the king&#x27;s soul. Two delegations from the clergy estate were appointed: one to the king, and one to Hedvig Taube. In July 1741, the statement was read to the king in his audience chamber. The king reacted with rage, refused to accept the statement and stated that the Riksdag of the Estates had promised him not to interfere in his private life. He was, on their second attempt, forced to receive the statement. When told the result of that audience with the king, the queen, Ulrika Eleonora insisted that the planned embassy to Hedvig Taube was also to be executed according to plan, and replied to the hesitation of the bishop with the words: &quot;When you priests follow your calling and your conscience, you do well to do so with no concern of other matters.&quot; On this occasion, Hedvig Taube defended her by saying that she had never been aware of any negative reaction whatsoever from the Queen.

Ulrika Eleonora served as regent twice: The first time during Frederick&#x27;s absence in 1731, and the second time during his illness in 1738–1739. She was declared regent in May 1731 when Frederick departed to visit Hesse, and ruled until his return in the autumn. In 1738, she was asked by the Estates to accept the regency at an occasion when Frederick was so ill that he was in danger of dying and was incapable of ruling. She duly accepted this task and handled the state affairs until after New Year&#x27;s Eve 1738–39. During her second regency, she banned the newly founded Swedish theatre by refusing to extend their access to Bollhuset; her reason for this was opposition toward the theatre among the clergy. The theatre, however, was restored the following year.

Ulrika Eleonora was interested in jewelry and music. She enjoyed to participate in the dance at court balls, and though religious scruples made her conflicted in the issue, she also engaged German and French theatre companies to perform at Bollhuset. Intensely religious, she was capable of interrupting a parliamentary session to pray. Similarly, at court presentations, she could interrogate the female debutantes about the Bible, rewarding them for correct answers. Sternly maintaining her royal pride, she was known to simulate illness and decline to leave her quarters when she felt insulted. Her dependency upon Emerentia von Düben has often been mentioned, but she had several additional friends, among them Hedvig Mörner, as well as her childhood friend Anna Fleming, who was her lady-in-waiting for thirty years.

Queen Ulrika Eleonora died of smallpox in 1741. There were rumours that she had been poisoned, but these rumours were silenced when the marks of her illness were visible during her public lit de parade. As she had been the heir to the throne, her death marked the beginning of a succession crisis.

<text>Daniel Michael DeVito Jr. (born November 17, 1944) is an American actor and filmmaker. He gained prominence for his portrayal of the taxi dispatcher Louie De Palma in the television series &quot;Taxi&quot; (1978–1983), which won him a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award. He plays Frank Reynolds on the FXX sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; (2006–present).

DeVito is known for his film roles in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975), &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983), &quot;Head Office&quot; (1985), &quot;Ruthless People&quot; (1986), &quot;Throw Momma from the Train&quot; (1987), &quot;Twins&quot; (1988), &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; (1989), &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), &quot;Jack the Bear&quot; (1993), &quot;Junior&quot; (1994), &quot;Matilda&quot; (1996), &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997), &quot;The Big Kahuna&quot; (1999), &quot;Big Fish&quot; (2003), &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; (2006), &quot;When in Rome&quot; (2010), &quot;Wiener-Dog&quot; (2016) and &quot;&quot; (2019). He has voiced roles in such films as &quot;Hercules&quot; (1997), &quot;The Lorax&quot; (2012), &quot;Smallfoot&quot; (2018) and &quot;Migration&quot; (2023).

DeVito and Michael Shamberg founded Jersey Films. Soon afterwards, Stacey Sher became an equal partner. The production company is known for films such as &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), &quot;Garden State&quot; (2004) and &quot;Freedom Writers&quot; (2007). DeVito also owned Jersey Television, which produced the Comedy Central series &quot;Reno 911!&quot; DeVito and wife Rhea Perlman starred together in his 1996 film &quot;Matilda&quot;, based on Roald Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel. DeVito was also one of the producers nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture for &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (2000).

From 2012 to 2013, DeVito played Willie Clark in the West End revival of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot;. He made his Broadway debut as Gregory Solomon in the revival of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Price&quot; (2017), earning a Tony Award nomination for his performance. He returned to Broadway in the Theresa Rebeck play &quot;I Need That&quot; (2023).

==Early life and education==
DeVito was born at Raleigh Fitkin-Paul Morgan Memorial Hospital in Neptune Township, New Jersey, the son of Daniel DeVito Sr., a small business owner and Julia DeVito ( Moccello). He grew up in a family of five, with his parents and two older sisters. He is of Italo-Albanian descent; his family is originally from San Fele, Basilicata, as well as from the Arbëresh Albanian community of Calabria. He was raised in Asbury Park, New Jersey. He lived a few miles away from the original Jersey Mike&#x27;s location and would eat there frequently, which would inspire him to become the sub shop&#x27;s first celebrity spokesman in a line of commercials that began to air in September 2022.

DeVito was raised as a Catholic. When he was 14, he persuaded his father to send him to boarding school to &quot;keep him out of trouble&quot;, and graduated from Oratory Preparatory School in Summit, New Jersey, in 1962. While working as a beautician at his sister&#x27;s salon, his search for a professional makeup instructor led him to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he graduated in 1966. In his early theater days, he performed with the Colonnades Theater Lab at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut. Along with his future wife Rhea Perlman, he appeared in plays produced by the Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective.

==Career==
=== Acting ===
DeVito started his career acting off-Broadway in the plays &quot;Shoot Anything With Hair That Moves&quot; and &quot;The Man with the Flower in His Mouth&quot; both in 1969. DeVito played Martini in the 1975 film &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; directed by Milos Forman, reprising his role from the 1971 off-Broadway play of the same title. He had his feature film debut in the drama &quot;Dreams of Glass&quot; (1970). Early film roles include &quot;Lady Liberty&quot; (1971), &quot;Hurry Up, or I&#x27;ll Be 30&quot; (1973) and &quot;Deadly Hero&quot; (1975).

In 1977, DeVito played the role of John &quot;John John the Apple&quot; DeAppoliso in the &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; episode &quot;The Collector&quot;. DeVito gained fame in 1978 playing Louie De Palma, the short but domineering dispatcher for the fictional Sunshine Cab Company, on the hit TV show &quot;Taxi&quot;. For his performance he received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.

After his breakthrough on the sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot;, DeVito devoted more effort to a growing successful film career. He took a supporting role as Vernon Dalhart in the James L. Brooks directed comedy-drama &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983) acting alongside Shirley MacLaine, Debra Winger and Jack Nicholson. The film earned critical acclaim as well as the Academy Award for Best Picture.

The following year he acted in the crime comedy &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot; (1984) and took the role as the comic rogue Ralph in the romantic adventure &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; (1984), starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner; and its sequel, &quot;The Jewel of the Nile&quot; (1985). In 1986, DeVito starred in &quot;Ruthless People&quot; with Bette Midler and Judge Reinhold and also voiced the character Grundle King in &quot;My Little Pony: The Movie&quot;. In 1987 he acted in director Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Tin Men&quot; (1987), as a rival salesman to Richard Dreyfuss&#x27; character.

In 1990, he and Rhea Perlman played the couple Vic &amp; Paula, commenting on the state of the environment in &quot;The Earth Day Special&quot;. The following year he acted in &quot;Other People&#x27;s Money&quot; (1991) with Gregory Peck. In 1991 and 1992, DeVito voiced Herb Powell in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episodes &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot; and &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;. In 1992 he portrayed the villain Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin in director Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992) acting opposite Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken. That same year he directed and produced the biographical drama film &quot;Hoffa&quot; (1992) starring Jack Nicholson. He also acted in the film portraying Bobby Ciaro. DeVito also acted opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in the comedies &quot;Twins&quot; (1988) and &quot;Junior&quot; (1994).

In 1995, DeVito appeared in the gangster comedy &quot;Get Shorty&quot;. In 1996, he took supporting roles as Swackhammer in the Looney Tunes live-action / animated sports comedy &quot;Space Jam&quot; and reunited with Tim Burton&#x27;s science fiction comedy &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; starring Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Martin Short and Natalie Portman.

In 1997, he played Deck Shifflet in the legal thriller &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; starring Matt Damon and Claire Danes as well as Sid Hudgens, editor of a sleazy tabloid called &quot;Hush-Hush&quot;, who gets tips ahead of time of celebrity arrests in the neo-noir thriller &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; with Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey, the latter of which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. That same year he also voiced Phil in the Walt Disney Animated film &quot;Hercules&quot; (1997). Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the voice performances writing, &quot;As in &quot;Aladdin&quot;, the melding of character animation with the screen personae of the actors voicing the roles provides forceful and amusing entertainment, particularly in DeVito&#x27;s turn as a physical trainer and the acid wit James Woods brings to his villainous role.&quot;

He starred in &quot;Living Out Loud&quot; (1988) alongside Helen Hunt and Queen Latifah, reunited with Kevin Spacey in &quot;The Big Kahuna&quot; (1999) and hosted the last &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode before the year 2000. In 1999, he produced and co-starred in the biographical drama film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, a film about the unusual life of his former &quot;Taxi&quot; co-star Andy Kaufman, played in the film by Jim Carrey. He also played Dr. Hornicker in the Sofia Coppola directed &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999) starring Kirsten Dunst. He continued to take roles in comedy films such as &quot;Drowning Mona&quot; (2000), &quot;Screwed&quot; (2000), &quot;What&#x27;s the Worst That Could Happen?&quot; (2001), &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (2002), &quot;Anything Else&quot; (2003) and &quot;Be Cool&quot; (2005). He also acted in the drama films &quot;Heist&quot; (2001) and &quot;Big Fish&quot; (2004). He earned a 2004 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series nomination for his role of a stripper in the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;,
In 2006, he joined the cast of the FX / FXX sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; as Frank Reynolds. DeVito stars opposite Glenn Howerton, Rob McElhenney, Kaitlin Olson and Charlie Day. The character of Frank Reynolds is introduced at the beginning of Season 2. He received a nomination for the Satellite Award for Best Actor – Musical or Comedy Series. DeVito said of the show &quot;I loved it. It was fucking outrageous just the way they are. I immediately said, &#x27;Yeah, this is an amazing show. Also in 2006 he starred opposite Matthew Broderick in the Christmas comedy film &quot;Deck the Halls&quot;.

DeVito has an interest in documentaries. In 2006 he began a partnership with Morgan Freeman&#x27;s company ClickStar, for whom he hosts the documentary channel Jersey Docs. He was also interviewed in the documentary &quot;Revenge of the Electric Car,&quot; discussing his interest in and ownership of electric vehicles. DeVito has directed eight short films between 1973 and 2016, five of which were released across 2010 and 2011. These are &quot;The Sound Sleeper&quot; (1973), &quot;Minestrone&quot; (1975), &quot;Oh Those Lips&quot; (2010), &quot;Evil Eye&quot; (2010), &quot;Poison Tongue&quot; (2011), &quot;Skin Deep&quot; (2011), &quot;Nest of Vipers&quot; (2011) and &quot;Curmudgeons&quot; (2016). In 2011, DeVito received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in television. In 2012, he voiced the title character in the animated version of Dr. Seuss&#x27; &quot;The Lorax&quot;. He appeared in the &quot;Angry Birds Friends&quot; &quot;Champions for Earth&quot; tournament advertisement in September 2015. Following the Japanese release of the Nintendo 3DS game &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;, dedicated &quot;Pokémon&quot; fans submitted a 40,000-signature petition requesting that DeVito be the English voice actor for the title character. However, he declined to audition for the role, commenting that he was unfamiliar with the franchise.

In April 2012, DeVito made his West End acting debut in a revival of the Neil Simon play &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; as Willie Clark, alongside Richard Griffiths. It previewed at the Savoy Theatre in London from April 27, 2012, opened on May 17 and played a limited 12-week season until July 28. DeVito played a fictional version of himself in the music video of One Direction&#x27;s song &quot;Steal My Girl&quot; (2014). He also appeared in the short film &quot;Curmudgeons&quot;, which he also produced and directed. In 2013, he would voice Herb for a third time in the episode &quot;The Changing of the Guardian&quot;. DeVito made his Broadway debut in a Roundabout Theatre Company revival of the Arthur Miller play &quot;The Price&quot; as Gregory Solomon. He acted opposite Mark Ruffalo and Tony Shalhoub. Marilyn Stasio of &quot;Variety&quot; praised DeVito&#x27;s performance writing, &quot;DeVito, who holds the audience in the palm of his hand, tends to favor the comic side, making an extended meal out of an egg-eating visual gag. But he also draws on down-to-earth Jewish wisdom to keep family hostilities from boiling over and spoiling the financial negotiations&quot;. He went on to be nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. The production began preview performances at the American Airlines Theatre on February 16, 2017 and opened on March 16 for a limited run-through on May 7.

In 2018 he had a guest starring role in the Netflix comedy series &quot;The Kominsky Method&quot; acting opposite Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin. He also voiced Dorgle in the Warner Bros. animated film &quot;Smallfoot&quot; (2018). The following year in 2019 he reunited with Tim Burton playing Max Medici in the live action Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures &quot;Dumbo&quot;, a remake of the 1941 animated film. He acted alongside Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton and Eva Green. He also played Eddie Gilpin in the action comedy film &quot;&quot; starring Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan. The film was a box office and critical success. In 2020 he voiced Bob, a stray dog in &quot;The One and Only Ivan&quot;. In 2021 he played Charlie Goldman the biographical HBO drama film &quot;The Survivor&quot;. That same year DeVito wrote a 12-page story centered on the Penguin and Catwoman for the anthology comic &quot;Gotham City Villains&quot;. In 2023 he acted in the Disney horror comedy &quot;Haunted Mansion&quot;, Chris Pine&#x27;s directorial film debut &quot;Poolman&quot; and the Illumination animated film &quot;Migration&quot;. Also in 2023 he returned to Broadway in the Theresa Rebeck play &quot;I Need That&quot;.

=== Directing ===
DeVito made his directorial debut in 1984 with &quot;The Ratings Game&quot;. In 1986, he directed and starred in the black comedy &quot;The Wedding Ring&quot;, a season 2 episode of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, where his character acquires an engagement ring for his wife (played by DeVito&#x27;s real-life wife, actress Rhea Perlman). When the ring is slipped on his wife&#x27;s finger, she is possessed by the ring&#x27;s former owner, a murderous black widow. In 1987 he made his feature-directing debut with the dark comedy &quot;Throw Momma from the Train&quot;, in which he starred with Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey. For his performance he earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination.

DeVito reunited with &quot;Jewel of the Nile&quot; co-stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in 1989 when he directed and starred alongside them in &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;. In 1996 he directed &quot;Matilda&quot; (1996), a film adaptation of Roald Dahl&#x27;s 1988 classic children&#x27;s novel of the same name. Critic Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote, &quot;There is never a moment (except toward the happy ending) that we sense DeVito is anything other than quite serious about this material. He goes with Dahl&#x27;s macabre vision.&quot; He also served as the Narrator and played the villainous used-car dealer father Harry Wormwood opposite his wife Rhea Perlman. The following year, he was in talks to direct the crime drama &quot;The Little Things&quot; with Robert De Niro at that time set to star, and &quot;The Crowded Room&quot; with Leonardo DiCaprio. Both projects were eventually realized in the 2020s, but without DeVito&#x27;s involvement.

In 1998, he committed to star in and direct both the sci-fi film &quot;Barthe&quot; for TriStar, about an alien who falls in love, and a remake of &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; for DreamWorks. In 1999, DeVito was attached to star, direct and produce Jason Keller&#x27;s spec script &quot;Sugar&#x27;s Sweet Science of Bruising&quot; for New Line Cinema.

For the next two years, DeVito was attached to film Michael Petroni&#x27;s &quot;Revelations&quot;, a &quot;supernatural religious thriller&quot; that was to have starred George Clooney. The project was delayed due to rewrites however, and DeVito instead resurfaced with &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot; (2002) and &quot;Duplex&quot; (2003), which he made back-to-back. Before the release of the latter, he agreed to direct a remake of 1942&#x27;s &quot;I Married a Witch&quot; for Tom Cruise and Columbia Pictures, announcing to &quot;Variety&quot; that he hoped to begin production by the end of the year.

Instead of &quot;I Married a Witch&quot;, he sought to make &quot;Trump vs. Wynn&quot; as his next directorial project after receiving an offer from HBO. Written by Rick Cleveland, the script chronicles business tycoons Donald Trump and Steve Wynn&#x27;s competition to build a casino in Atlantic City. DeVito was expected to direct, produce and star in an unspecified role, but he dropped out after meeting with both figures, who protested the film&#x27;s production.

He directed the pilot episode for a proposed 2005 Imagine TV sitcom &quot;Queen B&quot;, which was not picked up by the network for series.

In 2009, it was reported that DeVito would direct and produce the biopic &quot;Crazy Eddie&quot;, based on the life of consumer electronics king Eddie Antar, from a script by Peter Steinfeld. However the film could not be made due to a life rights deal that was made with Antar. Instead, he pivoted to making the apocalyptic horror thriller &quot;St. Sebastian&quot;, which completed post-production in 2012 but to this day has not been released. DeVito also worked on the independently financed &quot;Honeymoon with Dad&quot;, a comedy which never went into production.

DeVito has written a film adaptation of and been, since 2008, attached to direct &quot;The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle&quot; with Morgan Freeman, Pierce Brosnan and Saoirse Ronan starring. The production was halted when Freeman was seriously injured in a car accident two weeks before filming was scheduled to commence. DeVito returned to the subject in February 2013, saying he was looking for another young actress to star in the title role and scouting movie locations in Ireland. Production was expected to restart in July 2014. The release date is still classified as &quot;TBD&quot; without any new information as to whether it will be shot.

=== Producing ===
DeVito founded Jersey Films in 1991, producing films like &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), &quot;Get Shorty&quot; (1995), &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (2000) (for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture), &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997) and &quot;Garden State&quot; (2004).

DeVito also produced the Comedy Central series &quot;Reno 911!&quot;, the film spin-off &quot;Reno 911!: Miami&quot; and the revival on Quibi.

In 2019, his company Jersey Films optioned the screen rights to make a film of &quot;Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation&quot;, by Dan Fagin.

==Personal life==
DeVito stands tall. His short stature is the result of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (Fairbank&#x27;s disease), a rare genetic disorder that affects bone growth.
On January 17, 1971, DeVito met Rhea Perlman when she went to see a friend in the single performance of the play &quot;The Shrinking Bride&quot;, which featured DeVito. They moved in together two weeks later and married on January 28, 1982. They have three children: Lucy Chet DeVito (born March 11, 1983), Grace Fan DeVito (born March 1985) and Jacob Daniel DeVito (born October 1987).

Perlman and DeVito have acted alongside each other several times, including in the television show &quot;Taxi&quot; and the feature film &quot;Matilda&quot; (where they played Matilda&#x27;s parents). They separated in October 2012, after 30 years of marriage and over 40 years together, then reconciled in March 2013. They separated for a second time in March 2017, but remained on amicable terms and Perlman stated they had no intent of filing for divorce. In 2019, Perlman told interviewer Andy Cohen that she and DeVito have become closer friends after their separation than they were in their final years as a couple.

DeVito and Perlman resided in a 14,579-square-foot (1,354 m2) house in Beverly Hills, California, that they purchased in 1994, until selling it for US$24 million in April 2015. They also own a bungalow near Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills and a multi-residence compound on Broad Beach in Malibu. They also frequented a home they owned in Interlaken, New Jersey, to get away from Los Angeles.

DeVito has mentioned being a big fan of singer Mike Patton&#x27;s various musical projects, being introduced to his work though his son Jacob in 2005. DeVito collaborated with Patton on a music video and has attended several of his concerts, with Perlman contributing an introductory voiceover to an album by Mr. Bungle, one of Patton&#x27;s bands. In 2016, DeVito also included music from Patton&#x27;s band Faith No More on &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.&quot;

==Acting credits and accolades==
DeVito has an extensive film career, dating back to the early 1970s.

<doc id="104942" wikidata="Q52936" url="?curid=104942" title="Charles X Gustav">
<text>Charles X Gustav, also Carl X Gustav (; 8 November 1622 – 13 February 1660), was King of Sweden from 1654 until his death. He was the son of John Casimir, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken-Kleeburg and Catherine of Sweden. After his father&#x27;s death he also succeeded him as Pfalzgraf. He was married to Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp, who bore his son and successor, Charles XI. Charles X Gustav was the second Wittelsbach king of Sweden after the childless king Christopher of Bavaria (1441–1448) and he was the first king of the Swedish &quot;Caroline era&quot;, which had its peak during the end of the reign of his son, Charles XI. He led Sweden during the Second Northern War, enlarging the Swedish Empire. By his predecessor Christina, he was considered &quot;de facto&quot; Duke of Eyland (Öland), before ascending to the Swedish throne. From 1655 to 1657, he was also Grand Duke of Lithuania.

His numbering as &quot;Charles X&quot; derives from a 16th-century invention. The Swedish king Charles IX (1604–1611) chose his numeral after studying a fictitious history of Sweden. This king was the fourth actual King Charles, but has never been called &quot;Charles IV&quot;.

==Heir presumptive==
In his early childhood, raised in the Swedish court alongside his cousin Queen Christina, he received an excellent civil education. Later Charles X learned the art of war under Lennart Torstenson, being present at the second Battle of Breitenfeld (1642) and at Jankowitz (1645). From 1646 to 1648 he frequented the Swedish court, supposedly as a prospective husband of his cousin the queen regnant, Christina of Sweden (1626–89, reigned 1632–54), but her insurmountable objection to wedlock put an end to these anticipations, and to compensate her cousin for a broken half-promise she declared him her successor in 1649, despite the opposition of the Privy Council headed by Axel Oxenstierna. In 1648 he gained the appointment of commander of the Swedish forces in Germany. The conclusion of the treaties of Westphalia in October 1648 prevented him from winning the military laurels he is said to have desired, but as the Swedish plenipotentiary at the executive congress of Nuremberg, he had an opportunity to learn diplomacy, a science he is described as having quickly mastered. As the recognized heir to the throne, his position on his return to Sweden was dangerous because of the growing discontent with the queen. He therefore withdrew to the isle of Öland until the abdication of Christina on 5 June 1654 called him to the throne.

==Early days as king==

Charles X Gustav was crowned on 7 June 1654, the day after his cousin Christina abdicated. The beginning of Charles X&#x27;s reign concentrated on the healing of domestic discords and on the rallying of all the forces of the nation round his standard for a new policy of conquest. On the recommendation of his predecessor, he contracted a political marriage on 24 October 1654 with Hedwig Eleonora, the daughter of Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. He was hoping to secure a future ally against Denmark. The Riksdag which assembled at Stockholm in March 1655, duly considered the two great pressing national questions: war, and the restitution of the alienated crown lands. Over three days a secret committee presided over by the King decided the war question: Charles X easily persuaded the delegates that a war against Poland appeared necessary and might prove very advantageous; but the consideration of the question of the subsidies due to the crown for military purposes was postponed to the following Riksdag. In 1659 he proclaimed severe punishment for anyone hunting in the royal game reserve in Ottenby, Öland, Sweden, where he had built a long dry-stone wall separating the southern tip of the island.

==Second Northern War (1655–1660)==
===War in Poland-Lithuania===

On 10 July 1655, Charles X left Sweden to engage in a war against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in what became the Second (or Little) Northern War (1655–1660). By the time war was declared he had at his disposal 50,000 men and 50 warships. Hostilities had already begun with the occupation of Dünaburg in Polish Livonia by the Swedes on 1 July 1655. Then on 21 July 1655 Swedish army under Arvid Wittenberg crossed into Poland and proceeded towards the encampment of the Greater Poland Levy of the Nobility (pospolite ruszenie) encamped among the banks of the Noteć river, with some regular infantry for support. On 25 July the Polish noble levy army capitulated, and the voivodeships of Poznań and Kalisz placed themselves under the protection of the Swedish King. Thereupon the Swedes entered Warsaw without opposition and occupied the whole of Greater Poland. The Polish king, John II Casimir of Poland (1648–68) of the House of Vasa, eventually fled to Silesia after his armies had suffered defeats. A great number of Polish nobles and their personal armies joined the Swedes, including the majority of the famous Winged Hussars. Many Poles saw Charles X Gustav as a strong monarch who could be a more effective leader than John II Casimir.

Meanwhile, Charles X Gustav pressed on towards Kraków, which the Swedes captured after a two-month siege. The fall of Kraków followed a capitulation of the Polish Royal armies, but before the end of the year a reaction began in Poland herself. On 18 November 1655 the Swedes invested the fortress-monastery of Częstochowa, but the Poles defended it and after a seventy days&#x27; siege the Swedish besiegers had to retire with great loss. This success elicited popular enthusiasm in Poland and gave rise to a nationalistic and religious rhetoric concerning the war and Charles X. He was depicted as tactless and his mercenaries barbaric. His refusal to legalize his position by summoning the Polish diet and his negotiations for the partition of the very state he affected to befriend, awoke a nationalistic spirit in the country.

In the beginning of 1656 King John II Casimir returned from exile and the reorganised Polish army, increased in numbers. By this time Charles had discovered that he could more readily defeat the Poles than conquer Poland. What is described as his chief object, the conquest of Prussia, remained unaccomplished, and a new Swedish adversary arose in the elector of Brandenburg, Frederick William I, alarmed by the ambition of the Swedish king. Charles forced the elector, albeit at the point of the sword, to become his ally and vassal (Treaty of Königsberg, 17 January 1656); but the Polish national rising now imperatively demanded his presence in the south. For weeks he engaged in the pursuit of Polish divisions engaged in guerrilla tactics in the snow-covered plains of Poland, penetrating as far south as Jarosław in Ruthenian Voivodeship (województwo ruskie), by which time he had lost two-thirds of his 15,000 men army with no apparent result. In the meantime, the Russians signed a cease-fire with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Truce of Vilna) and then pursued a campaign in Livonia and laid siege to Riga, the second largest city in the Swedish Realm.

Charles&#x27;s retreat from Jarosław to Warsaw almost ended with disaster. His forces were trapped by the three converging Polish-Lithuanian armies in a marshy forest region intersected in every direction by well-guarded rivers. Escaping this disaster is considered one of his most brilliant achievements. But on 21 June 1656 the Poles retook Warsaw, and four days later Charles was obliged to purchase the assistance of Frederick William I, by the treaty of Marienburg (23 June 1656). On 28–30 July the combined Swedes and Brandenburgers, 18,000 strong, after a three days&#x27; battle, defeated John Casimir&#x27;s army of 40,000 at Warsaw, however the Polish-Lithuanian forces promptly withdrew with no large losses and apparent strong will to fight another day, while Swedish host reoccupied the Polish capital again, causing much destruction to the city and its inhabitants. However, this feat of arms did not have the desired result for Charles, and when Frederick William compelled the Swedish king to open negotiations with the Poles, they refused the terms offered, the war resumed, and Charles concluded an offensive and defensive alliance with the elector of Brandenburg (Treaty of Labiau, 20 November 1656) which stipulated that Frederick William and his heirs should henceforth possess the full sovereignty of East Prussia.

===War with Denmark–Norway===
Labiau involved an essential modification of Charles&#x27;s Baltic policy; but the alliance with the elector of Brandenburg had now become indispensable for him on almost any terms. The difficulties of Charles X in Poland are believed to have caused him to receive the tidings of the Danish-Norwegian declaration of war on 1 June 1657 with extreme satisfaction. He had learnt from Torstensson that Denmark was most vulnerable if attacked from the south, and he attacked Denmark with a velocity which paralysed resistance. At the end of June 1657, at the head of 8,000 seasoned veterans, he broke up from &quot;Bromberg&quot; (Bydgoszcz) south of Pomerania and reached the borders of Holstein on 18 July. The Danish army dispersed and the Swedes recovered the duchy of Bremen. In the early autumn Charles&#x27;s troops swarmed over Jutland and firmly established themselves in the duchies. But the fortress of Fredriksodde (Fredericia) held Charles&#x27;s smaller army at bay from mid-August to mid-October, while the fleet of Denmark–Norway, after two days&#x27; battle, compelled the Swedish fleet to abandon its projected attack on the Danish islands. The position of the Swedish king had now become critical. In July Denmark–Norway and Poland-Lithuania concluded an offensive and defensive alliance. Still more ominously for the Swedes, the elector of Brandenburg, perceiving Sweden&#x27;s difficulties, joined the league against Sweden and compelled Charles to accept the proffered mediation of Oliver Cromwell, Coenraad van Beuningen and Cardinal Mazarin. The negotiations foundered, however, upon the refusal of Sweden to refer the points in dispute to a general peace-congress, and Charles received encouragement from the capture of Fredriksodde, 23–24 October, whereupon he began to make preparations for conveying his troops over to Funen in transport vessels. But soon another and cheaper expedient presented itself. In the middle of December 1657 began the great frost, which would prove so fatal to Denmark–Norway. In a few weeks the cold had grown so intense that the freezing of an arm of the sea with so rapid a current as the Small Belt became a conceivable possibility; and henceforth meteorological observations formed an essential part of the strategy of the Swedes.

====March across the Belts====
On 28 January 1658, Charles X arrived at Haderslev in South Jutland. His meteorologists estimated that in a couple of days the ice of the Little Belt would become firm enough to bear even the passage of a mail-clad host. The cold during the night of 29 January became most severe; and early in the morning of the 30th the Swedish king gave the order to start, the horsemen dismounting on the weaker spots of ice and cautiously leading their horses as far apart as possible, until they swung into their saddles again, closed their ranks and made a dash for the shore. Swedish arms quickly overpowered the Danish troops lining the opposite coast and won the whole of Funen with the loss of only two companies of cavalry, which disappeared under the ice while fighting with the Danish left wing. Pursuing his march, Charles X, with his eyes fixed on Copenhagen, resolved to cross the frozen Great Belt also. However, he accepted the advice of his chief engineer officer Erik Dahlberg, who acted as pioneer throughout and chose the more circuitous route from Svendborg, by the islands of Langeland, Lolland and Falster, in preference to the direct route from Nyborg to Korsør, which would have had to cross a broad, almost uninterrupted expanse of ice. A council of war, which met at two o&#x27;clock in the morning to consider the practicability of Dahlberg&#x27;s proposal, dismissed it as hazardous. Even the king wavered; but when Dahlberg persisted in his opinion, Charles overruled the objections of the commanders. On the night of 5 February the transit began, the cavalry leading the way through the snow-covered ice, which quickly thawed beneath the horses&#x27; hoofs so that the infantry which followed after had to wade through half an ell (nearly 2 feet) of sludge, facing the risk that the ice would break beneath their feet. At three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, with Dahlberg leading the way, the army reached Grimsted in Lolland without losing a man; on 8 February, Charles reached Falster. On 11 February he stood safely on the soil of Zealand. A Swedish medal struck to commemorate the transit of the Baltic Sea bear the inscription: &quot;Natura hoc debuit uni&quot;. Sweden had achieved a rare war exploit, in Sweden considered to be matched only by the crusade of the Livonian Order led by William of Modena to conquer Saaremaa (Osel) in January 1227 and afterwards when two Russian armies crossed the frozen Gulf of Bothnia from Finland to mainland Sweden in March 1809 during the Finnish War. It is believed that the effect of this achievement on the Danish government found expression in the Treaty of Taastrup on 18 February, and in the Treaty of Roskilde (26 February 1658), whereby Denmark–Norway sacrificed a great part of her territory to save the rest. However, Charles X continued the war efforts against Denmark–Norway after a council held at Gottorp on 7 July, even though he was in defiance of international equity. Without warning, Denmark–Norway was attacked a second time.

On 17 July he again landed on Zealand and besieged Copenhagen with its king Frederick III of Denmark and Norway, but the city managed to hold out long enough for the Dutch fleet under Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam to relieve the city, defeating the Swedish fleet in the Battle of the Sound on 29 October 1658, and Copenhagen repelled a major assault afterwards.

==Estates in Gothenburg==
Charles X consented to reopen negotiations with Denmark, at the same time proposing to exercise pressure upon his rival by a simultaneous winter campaign in Norway. Such an enterprise necessitated fresh subsidies from his already impoverished people, and obliged him in December 1659 to cross over to Sweden to meet the estates, whom he had summoned to Gothenburg. The lower estates protested the imposition of fresh burdens, but were persuaded by Charles.

==Illness and death==

Soon after the estates opened on 4 January 1660, Charles X Gustav fell ill with symptoms of a cold. Ignoring his illness, he repeatedly went to inspect the Swedish forces near Gothenburg, and soon broke down with chills, headaches and dyspnoea. On 15 January, court physician Johann Köster arrived, and in medical error mistook Charles X Gustav&#x27;s pneumonia for scorbut and dyspepsia. Köster started a &quot;cure&quot; including the application of multiple enemata, laxatives, bloodletting and sneezing powder. While after three weeks the fever eventually was down and the coughing was better, the pneumonia had persisted and evolved into a sepsis by 8 February.

On 12 February, Charles X Gustav signed his testament: His son, Charles XI of Sweden, was still a minor, and Charles X Gustav appointed a minor regency consisting of six relatives and close friends. Charles X Gustav died the next day at the age of 37.

On the night between 12 and 13 February, he would die in the arms of Lord High Marshal Gabriel Oxenstierna after having urged him to bring peace to Sweden.

==Family==

Charles X Gustav had only one legitimate child by Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp: his successor Charles XI (1655–1697, reigned 1660–1697).

Before his marriage, his mistress Märta Allertz gave birth to their well-known son Gustaf Carlson (1647–1708), who became Count of Börringe and Lindholmen Castle in Scania.

There are credible theories suggesting that Charles X Gustav, before marrying Hedwig Eleonora (but not after), also sired several more children of whom some names are known: by Baroness Ludmila Jankovska von Lažan (1615–1655) a son Charles (Carolus Wenzeslaus) Jankovský z Vlašimi (1644–1684), who became Baron of Château Rešice in Moravia; by Walbor Staffansdotter son Nils Karlsson (who strongly resembled his father); by Sidonia Johansdotter son Samuel Karlsson and by an unknown woman daughter Anna Karlsdotter.

<text>Charles XI or Carl (; ) was King of Sweden from 1660 until his death, in a period of Swedish history known as the Swedish Empire (1611–1721).

He was the only son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father died when he was four years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon afterward, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country&#x27;s neglected political, financial, and economic situation. He managed to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government, and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe.

Though Charles was crowned as Charles XI, he was not the 11th king of Sweden of that name. His father&#x27;s name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. That ancestor was actually the third King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.

==Under guardian rule==
Charles was born in the Stockholm Palace Tre Kronor in November 1655. His father, Charles X of Sweden, had left Sweden in July that year to fight in the war against Poland. After several years of warfare, the king returned in the winter of 1659, and gathered his family and the Riksdag of the Estates in Gothenburg. Here he beheld his four-year-old son for the first time. Only a few weeks later, in mid-January 1660, the king fell ill; one month later, he wrote his last will and died.

Charles X Gustav&#x27;s will and testament left the administration of the Swedish Empire during Charles XI&#x27;s minority to a regency led by Queen Dowager Hedwig Eleonora as both formal regent and chair of a six-member Regency Council with two votes and a final say over the rest of the council. Per Brahe was one member of the council. In addition, Charles X Gustav left command of the army and a seat on the council to his younger brother, Adolph John I, Count Palatine of Kleeburg. These provisions among others led to the remainder of the council immediately challenging the will. On 14 February, the day after King Charles X&#x27;s death, Hedwig Eleonora sent a message to the council stating that she knew that they contested the will and that she demanded that it should be respected. The council answered that the will must first be discussed with the parliament, and at the following council in Stockholm on 13 May, the council tried to keep her from attending. The parliament questioned whether it would be good for her health or suitable for a widow to attend council, and that if not, it would be hard to keep sending a messenger to her quarters. Her reply that the council would be allowed to meet without her and only inform her when they considered it necessary was met with satisfaction from the council. Hedwig Eleonora&#x27;s ostensible indifference to politics came as a great relief to the lords of the guardian government.

His mother, Queen Hedvig Eleonora, remained the formal regent until Charles XI attained his majority on 18 December 1672, but she was careful not to embroil herself in political conflicts.
During his first appearances in parliament, Charles spoke to the government through her. He would whisper the questions he had in her ear, and she would ask them aloud and clearly for him.
As an adolescent, Charles devoted himself to sports, exercise, and his favourite pastime of bear-hunting. He appeared ignorant of the very rudiments of statecraft and almost illiterate. His main difficulties are now seen as evident signs of dyslexia, a disability that was poorly understood at the time. According to many contemporary sources, the king was considered poorly educated and therefore not qualified to conduct himself effectively in foreign affairs. Charles was dependent on his mother and advisors to interact with the foreign envoys since he had no foreign language skills apart from German and was ignorant of the world outside Sweden.

Italian writer Lorenzo Magalotti visited Stockholm in 1674 and described the teenage Charles XI as &quot;virtually afraid of everything, uneasy to talk to foreigners, and not daring to look anyone in the face&quot;. Another trait was a deep religious devotion: he was God-fearing, frequently prayed kneeling and attended sermons. Magalotti otherwise described the king&#x27;s main pursuits as hunting, the upcoming war, and jokes.

==Scanian War==
The situation in Europe was shaky during this time and Sweden was going through financial problems. Charles XI&#x27;s guardians decided to negotiate an alliance with France in 1671. This would ensure that Sweden would not be isolated if there was a war, and that the national finances would improve thanks to French subsidies. France directed its aggression against the Dutch in 1672, and by the spring of 1674, Sweden was forced to take part by directing forces towards Brandenburg, under the lead of Karl Gustav Wrangel.

Denmark was an ally of the Habsburg Holy Roman Empire, and it was evident that Sweden was on the verge of yet another war with that country. A remedy was attempted by chancellor Nils Brahe, who traveled to Copenhagen in the spring of 1675 to try to get the Danish princess Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark engaged to the Swedish king. In mid-June 1675, the engagement was officially proclaimed. However, when news arrived of the Swedish defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin, Danish king Christian V declared war on Sweden that September.

The Swedish Privy Council continued its internal feuds, and the king was forced to rule without them.
The 20-year-old king was inexperienced and considered ill-served amidst what has been called the anarchy in the nation. He dedicated autumn in his newly formed camp in Scania to arm the Swedish nation for battle in the Scanian War. The Swedish soldiers in Scania were outnumbered and out-equipped by the Danes. In May 1676, they invaded Scania, taking Landskrona and Helsingborg, then proceeding through Bohuslän towards Halmstad. The King had to grow up quickly. He suddenly found himself alone and under great pressure.

Victory at the Battle of Halmstad (17 August 1676), when Charles and his commander-in-chief Simon Grundel-Helmfelt defeated a Danish division, was the king&#x27;s first glimmer of good luck. Charles continued south through Scania, arriving on the tableland of the flooded Kävlinge River – near Lund – on 11 November. The Danish army commanded by Christian V was positioned on the other side. It was impossible to cross the river and Charles had to wait for weeks until it froze over. This finally happened on 4 December and Charles launched a surprise attack on the Danish forces to fight the Battle of Lund. This was one of the bloodiest engagements of its time. Of the over 20,000 combatants, about 8,000 perished on the battlefield. All the Swedish commanders showed ability, but the chief glory of the day was attributed to Charles XI and his fighting spirit. The battle proved to be a decisive one for the rule of the Scanian lands and it has been described as the most significant event for Charles&#x27; personality. Charles commemorated this date the rest of his life.

In the following year, 13,000 men led by Charles routed 12,000 Danes at the Battle of Landskrona. This proved to be the last pitched battle of the war since, in September 1678, Christian V evacuated his army back to Zealand. In 1679, Louis XIV of France dictated the terms of a general pacification, and Charles XI, who is said to have bitterly resented &quot;the insufferable tutelage&quot; of the French king, was forced at last to acquiesce to a peace that managed to leave his empire practically intact. Peace was made with Denmark in the treaties of Fontainebleau (1679) and Lund, and with Brandenburg in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679).

==Post-war actions==

Charles devoted the rest of his life to avoiding further warfare by gaining larger independence in foreign affairs, while he also promoted economic stabilization and a reorganization of the military. His remaining 20 years on the throne were the longest peacetime of the Swedish Empire (1611–1718).

In the early years, he was assisted by the man who had become his trusted prime-minister, Johan Göransson Gyllenstierna (1635–1680). Some sources say the king was basically dependent on Gyllenstierna. His sudden death in 1680 opened up the road to the monarch, and many men tried to get close to the king to take Gyllenstierna&#x27;s place.

===Financial restoration===

Sweden&#x27;s weak economy had suffered during the war and was now in a deep crisis. Charles assembled the Riksdag of the Estates in October 1680. The assembly has been described as one of the most important held by the Riksdag of the Estates. Here, the king finally pushed through the reduction ordeal, something that had been discussed in the Riksdag since 1650. It meant that any land or object previously owned by the crown and lent or given away – including counties, baronies and lordships – could be recovered. It affected many prominent members of the nobility, some of whom were ruined by it. One of them was the former guardian and Lord Chief Justice Magnus De La Gardie, who, among many other Estates, had to return the extravagant 248-room Läckö Castle. The reduction process involved the examination of every title deed in the kingdom, including the dominions, and it resulted in a complete readjustment of the nation&#x27;s finances.

===Greycoat===
According to Swedish legend, Charles XI travelled around the country dressed as a farmer or simple traveller. In the legend he is referred to as &quot;the Greycoat&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Gråkappan&quot;). This was done to discover and identify corruption and oppression against the populace. There are many stories about him arriving in villages looking for corrupt church officials and punishing them. One anecdote tells of him visiting one village with a church in splendid condition and the priest living in poverty. Continuing, the King found in the next village a church in disrepair and a priest living lavishly. The King solved the situation by switching the priests, giving the poor priest the lavish living condition and a church the King was certain he would rebuild. Always followed by a military cortège, Charles toured the country more than other Swedish kings during this era and was famous for the speed at which he travelled, setting many records. The stories of &quot;the Greycoat&quot; were published in a book by Arvid August Afzelius in the middle of the 19th century.

===Absolutism===

Another important decision made during the assembly was that of the Swedish Privy Council. Since 1634, it had been mandatory for the king to take advice from the council. During the Scanian War, the members of the council were engaged in internal feuds, and the king more or less ruled without listening to their advice. At the 1680 assembly, he asked the Estates whether he was still bound to the council, to which the Estates responded with his desired reply: &quot;he was not bound by anyone other than himself&quot; &quot;(&quot;envälde&quot;),&quot; and thereby the absolute monarchy was formally established in Sweden. The Riksdag of the Estates confirmed his power in 1693 by officially proclaiming that the king was the sole ruler of Sweden.

===Military restructuring===
In the 1682 assembly of the Riksdag of the Estates, the king put forth his suggestion for military reform, whereby each of the lands of Sweden were to have 1,200 soldiers at the ready, at all times, and two farms were to provide accommodations for one soldier. His soldiers were known as Caroleans, trained to be skilled and preferring to attack rather than defend. Savagery and looting were strictly forbidden. Soldier huts around the country were the most visible part of the new Swedish allotment system. However, Charles also modernized the military techniques and worked to improve the skills and knowledge of the officers by sending them abroad to study.

Charles XI was initially enthusiastic about warfare and combat and he was often portrayed as the soldier-King. In the years after the Scanian War however, during which he personally engaged in the fighting and saw the devastation of war, he would later come to view that war was something better to be avoided if possible. With the recent war in mind he wanted to strengthen the armed forces for a defensive war which he knew would come sooner or later.

The Swedish navy suffered major defeats against Danish-Dutch forces in the Scanian War, revealing deficiencies in organization and supply, and disadvantages in basing the fleet at Stockholm. The navy was bolstered with the founding of an ice-free base at Karlskrona in 1680 which became the mainstay of future naval operations. Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===Assimilation of the newest territories===

Charles believed it was very important to assimilate the new Swedish territories of Scania, Blekinge, Halland, in southern Sweden; Bohuslän in western Sweden and Jämtland, in northern Sweden, and the island of Gotland. Some assimilation policies included: the ban of all books written in Danish or Norwegian; the use of Swedish language in the conduct of sermons; and all new priests and teachers having to come from Sweden.

The king had seen bitter resentment from the Scanian peasants during the Scanian War and was particularly tough on that province. The guerrilla &quot;Snapphane&quot; movement, in northern Scania, had attacked his soldiers and stolen his money. They also had strong support from the local villages. Charles remained suspicious of the Scanian inhabitants throughout his life. He did not allow soldiers from Scania in his Scanian regiment: the 1,200 soldiers that were to be stationed there had to be recruited from more northern provinces. He also advocated rough treatment of the inhabitants and the first Governor-General of Scania, his trusted aide Johan Gyllenstierna (governor-general 1679–1680), was notably brutal in his treatment of the locals. The rule of Rutger von Ascheberg (governor-general 1680–1693), proved more lenient.

The assimilation was not as strongly implemented in the German dominions of Swedish Pomerania, Bremen-Verden, and the Baltic dominions (Estonia and Livonia). In Germany, Charles found himself being opposed by the Estates there. He was also bound by the law of the German emperor and the peace treaty. In the Baltic, the power structure was completely different, with a German-descended nobility that used serfs, something that Charles abhorred and wanted to abolish but was unable to. Finally, Kexholm and Ingria were sparsely populated and not of great interest.

===Church===
Charles was a devoted Lutheran Christian. In February 1686, a church law was put forth on his initiative. The church order declared that the king was ruler of the Church in the same way that he ruled the country and God ruled the world. Attending sermons on Sunday was made obligatory and ordinary people found walking during that time risked arrest. Three years later, he declared it obligatory for all commoners to learn to read a catechism written by archbishop Olov Svebilius and then-bishop Haqvin Spegel so that they would understand the &quot;magnificence of God&quot;.

Charles encouraged the production of a hymnal (&quot;Psalmbok&quot;) to be printed and distributed to the churches (completed 1693), and a new printed version of the Bible that was completed in 1703 and named after his successor: &quot;Charles XII Bible&quot;.

==Family matters==

On 6 May 1680, Charles married Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark (1656–1693), daughter of King Frederick III of Denmark (1609–1670). He had previously been engaged to his cousin, Juliana of Hesse-Eschwege, but the engagement was broken after a scandal. Charles and Ulrika were engaged in 1675 in an attempt to smooth over longstanding hostilities, but the Scanian War soon broke out. During the war, Ulrika Eleonora gained a reputation for loyalty to her future home country by exhibiting kindness to Swedish prisoners: she pawned her jewelry, even her engagement ring, to care for the Swedish prisoners of war. Her personal merits and continued charitable acts throughout her tenure endeared her to the Swedish people and eased some of the difficulties brought on by her Danish background. In the peace negotiations between Sweden and Denmark in 1679, the marriage between her and Charles XI was on the agenda, and ratified on 26 September 1679. They married at Skottorp on 6 May 1680 in a hasty ceremony, as Charles prioritized government work over private matters, even a marriage ceremony.

Charles and Ulrika Eleonora were very different. He enjoyed hunting and riding, while she enjoyed reading and art, and is best remembered for her great charitable activity. She was also limited by ill-health and numerous pregnancies. Charles was very active and busy and while Charles was away inspecting his troops or pursuing his pastimes, she was often lonely and sad. The marriage itself, however, is considered a success, with the King and Queen being very fond of each other. As queen, Ulrika Eleonora had little political involvement and was placed in the shadow of her mother-in-law. During &quot;The Great Reversion&quot; to the crown of counties, baronies and large lordships from the nobility, Ulrika tried to speak on the behalf of the people whose property was confiscated by the crown. But the king told her that the reason he had married her was not because he wanted her political advice. Instead, she helped people whose property had been confiscated by secretly compensating them economically from her own budget. However Charles XI&#x27;s confidence in her grew over time: in 1690, he named her future Regent, should his son succeed him still a minor. Instead Ulrika Eleonora predeceased him by almost four years. At the time of her death she was personally supporting 17,000 people.

It is said that on his death bed, Charles XI admitted to his mother that he hadn&#x27;t been happy since Ulrika Eleonora&#x27;s death.

The marriage produced seven children, of whom only three outlived Charles:
* Hedwig Sophia (1681–1708), duchess of Holstein-Gottorp and grandmother of Tsar Peter III;
* Charles XII (1682–1718), who succeeded him to the throne; he had no issue
*Gustav (1683–1685)
*Ulric (1684–1685)
*Frederick (1685–1685)
*Charles Gustav (1686–1687)
*Ulrika Eleonora (&quot;the younger&quot;, 1688–1741), who succeeded her brother on the Swedish throne; no issue

Ulrika Eleonora (the elder) was sickly, and the many child births eventually broke her. When she became seriously ill, in 1693, Charles finally dedicated his time and care to her. Her death in July that year shook him deeply and he never fully recovered. Her infant son Ulric (1684–1685) had been given Ulriksdal Palace, which was renamed for him (&quot;Ulric&#x27;s Dale&quot;).

==Death==

Charles XI had complained of stomach pains since 1694. In the summer of 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had continuously become worse, but they had no viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King&#x27;s pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, at the age of 41. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.

==Legacy==

Charles XI has sometimes been described in Sweden as the greatest of all the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by his father and his son. In the first half of the 20th century, the view of him changed and he was regarded as dependent, uncertain, and easily influenced by others. In the most recent book, Rystad&#x27;s biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.

Charles XI was commemorated on the previous 500-kronor bill. His portrait is taken from one of Ehrenstrahl&#x27;s paintings, possibly the one displayed on this page. The king is pictured on the bill since the Bank of Sweden was founded in 1668, during Charles&#x27; reign.

The fortified town of Carlsburg near Bremen, at the site of modern Bremerhaven, was named after Charles XI. The Swedish town of Karlskrona, built during his reign to host the primary navy base in southern Sweden, which it remains to this day, is also named after him.

Charles&#x27;s Church in Tallinn, Estonia, is dedicated to Charles XI. The recognition of his sores and corpse didn&#x27;t show the incorruptibility that medieval hagiographers believed to be a sign of Christian sainthood. In 1697 the same belief caused Charles&#x27;s subjects to ask if &quot;God had put the illness inside the king ... to punish the people or Charles.&quot; Two years later, the course of events that highlighted the crisis was of the absolutism itself.

<doc id="104944" wikidata="Q52934" url="?curid=104944" title="Charles XII of Sweden">
<text>Charles XII, sometimes Carl XII () or Carolus Rex (17 June 1682 – 30 November 1718 O.S.), was King of Sweden from 1697 to 1718. He belonged to the House of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, a branch line of the House of Wittelsbach. Charles was the only surviving son of Charles XI and Ulrika Eleonora the Elder. He assumed power, after a seven-month caretaker government, at the age of fifteen.

In 1700, a triple alliance of Denmark–Norway, Saxony–Poland–Lithuania and Russia launched a threefold attack on the Swedish protectorate of Holstein-Gottorp and provinces of Livonia and Ingria, aiming to draw advantage as the Swedish Empire was unaligned and ruled by a young and inexperienced king, thus initiating the Great Northern War. Leading the Swedish army against the alliance, Charles won multiple victories despite being significantly outnumbered. A major victory over a much larger Russian army in 1700, at the Battle of Narva, compelled Peter the Great to sue for peace, an offer that Charles subsequently rejected. By 1706, Charles, now 24 years old, had forced all of his foes into submission. That year, Swedish forces under general Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld won a decisive victory over a combined army of Saxony and Russia at the Battle of Fraustadt. Russia was now the sole remaining hostile power.

Charles&#x27;s subsequent march on Moscow met with initial success as victory followed victory, the most significant of which was the Battle of Holowczyn where the smaller Swedish army routed a Russian army twice its size. The campaign ended with disaster when the Swedish army suffered heavy losses to a Russian force more than twice its size at Poltava. Charles had been incapacitated by a wound prior to the battle, rendering him unable to take command. The defeat was followed by the Surrender at Perevolochna. Charles spent the following years in exile in the Ottoman Empire before returning to lead an assault on Norway, trying to evict the Danish king from the war once more in order to aim all his forces at the Russians. Two campaigns met with frustration and ultimate failure, concluding with his death at the Siege of Fredriksten in 1718. At the time, most of the Swedish Empire was under foreign military occupation, though Sweden itself was still free. This situation was later formalized, albeit moderated in the subsequent Treaty of Nystad. The result was the end of the Swedish Empire, and also of its effectively organized absolute monarchy and war machine, commencing a parliamentary government unique for continental Europe, which would last for half a century until royal autocracy was restored by Gustav III.

Charles was an exceptionally skilled military leader and tactician as well as an able politician, credited with introducing important tax and legal reforms. As for his famous reluctance towards peace efforts, he is quoted by Voltaire as saying upon the outbreak of the war: &quot;I have resolved never to start an unjust war but never to end a legitimate one except by defeating my enemies&quot;. With the war consuming more than half his life and nearly all his reign, he never married and fathered no children. He was succeeded by his sister Ulrika Eleonora, who in turn was coerced to hand over all substantial powers to the Riksdag of the Estates and opted to surrender the throne to her husband Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel, who became King Frederick I of Sweden.

== Royal title ==
His title in full as the king of Sweden was as follows:

&quot;The Sovereign and Supreme Lord, His Majesty, Charles XII, by the Grace of God, King of Sweden, the Goths and the Wends, Grand Prince of Finland, Duke of Scania, Estonia, Livonia, Karelia, Bremen and Verden, Stettin, Pomerania, Rostock, of Kashubia and of Wenden, Prince of Rügen, Lord of Ingria and Wismar; Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke in Bavaria, of Jülich, Cleves and Berg.&quot;

The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XII does not mean that he was the twelfth king of Sweden by that name. Swedish kings Erik XIV () and Charles IX () gave themselves numerals after studying a mythological history of Sweden. He was actually the sixth King Charles.

== Early life ==
Prince Charles of Sweden was born on 17 June 1682 O.S. in the royal castle of Tre Kronor in Stockholm. He was the first son born to King Charles XI of Sweden and his wife, the Danish princess Ulrika Eleonora. He had an older sister, Hedvig Sophia, born in 1681. He spent more time with his parents than would be typical in a European royal court of the time and traveled with them from a very early age. Four more sons were born to the royal couple in the years following Charles&#x27;s birth: Gustav in 1683, Ulrik in 1684, Frederick in 1685, and Charles Gustavus in 1686. However, all of these four died in infancy. In 1688, Charles&#x27;s younger sister Ulrika Eleonora was born, who later succeeded him as ruler of Sweden. 

In 1693, Charles&#x27;s mother died, and his father found consolation in spending more time with his son and heir. Charles XI brought his son with him to inspections and on other official business. Charles received an excellent education and was conscientiously prepared for the throne. He learned to ride by the age of four and engaged in rigorous physical training in his adolescence. He was very strong-willed and as king often stubbornly stuck to the standards which had been instilled in him by his moral and religious education. In April 1697, Charles XI died, and Prince Charles ascended the Swedish throne. Charles XI had provided for a regency for his teenaged heir, but already in November 1697 the Riksdag (Sweden&#x27;s assembly of the Estates) recognized the fifteen-year-old Charles&#x27;s majority. Charles XII was the first (and the last) Swedish ruler to inherit absolute monarchical authority from his predecessor.

==Great Northern War==
=== Early campaigns ===
Around 1700, the monarchs of Denmark–Norway, Saxony (ruled by elector August II of Poland, who was also the king of Poland-Lithuania) and Russia united in an alliance against Sweden, mainly through the efforts of Johann Reinhold Patkul, a Livonian nobleman who turned traitor when the &quot;great reduction&quot; of Charles XI in 1680 stripped much of the nobility of lands and properties. In late 1699, Charles sent a minor detachment to reinforce his brother-in-law Duke Frederick IV of Holstein-Gottorp, who was attacked by Danish forces the following year. A Saxon army simultaneously invaded Swedish Livonia, and in February 1700 surrounded Riga, the most populous city of the Swedish Empire. Russia also declared war (August 1700), but stopped short of an attack on Swedish Ingria until September 1700.

Charles&#x27;s first campaign was against Denmark–Norway, ruled by his cousin Frederick IV of Denmark. For this campaign Charles secured the support of England and the Netherlands, both maritime powers concerned with Denmark&#x27;s threats too close to the Sound. Leading a force of 8,000 and 43 ships in an invasion of Zealand, Charles rapidly compelled the Danes to submit to the Peace of Travendal in August 1700, which indemnified Holstein.
Having forced Denmark–Norway to make peace within months, King Charles turned his attention upon the two other powerful neighbors, King August II (cousin to both Charles XII and Frederick IV of Denmark–Norway) and Peter the Great of Russia, who also had entered the war against him, ironically on the same day that Denmark came to terms.

Russia had opened their part of the war by invading the Swedish-held territories of Livonia and Estonia. Charles countered this by attacking the Russian besiegers at the Battle of Narva (November 1700). The Russians outnumbered the Swedish army of ten thousand men by almost four to one. Charles attacked under cover of a blizzard, effectively splitting the Russian army in two and won the battle. Many of Peter&#x27;s troops who fled the battlefield drowned in the Narva River. The total number of Russian fatalities reached about 10,000 at the end of the battle, while the Swedish forces lost 667 men.

Charles did not pursue the Russian army. Instead, he turned against Poland-Lithuania, which was formally neutral at this point, thereby disregarding Polish negotiation proposals supported by the Swedish parliament. Charles defeated the Polish king Augustus II and his Saxon allies at the Battle of Kliszow in 1702 and captured many cities of the Commonwealth. After the deposition of Augustus as king of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Charles XII put Stanisław Leszczyński as his puppet on the Polish throne (1704).

=== Russian resurgence ===

While Charles won several decisive battles in the Commonwealth and ultimately secured the coronation of his ally Stanisław Leszczyński and the surrender of Saxony, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great embarked on a military reform plan that improved the Russian army, using the effectively organized Swedes and other European armies as role models. Russian forces managed to penetrate Ingria, where they established a new city, Saint Petersburg. Charles planned an invasion of the Russian heartland, allying himself with Ivan Mazepa, Hetman of the Ukrainian Cossacks. The size of the invading Swedish army was peeled off as Charles left Leszczyński with some 24,000 German and Polish troops, departing eastwards from Saxony in late 1707 with some 35,000 men, adding a further 12,500 under Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt marching from Livonia. Charles left the homeland with a defense force of approximately 28,800 men, with a further 14,000 in Swedish Finland, as well as other garrisons in the Baltic and German provinces.

After securing his &quot;favorite&quot; victory in the Battle of Holowczyn, despite being outnumbered over three to one by the new Russian army, Charles opted to march eastwards on Moscow rather than try to seize Saint Petersburg, founded from the Swedish town of Nyenskans five years earlier. Peter the Great managed, however, to ambush Lewenhaupt&#x27;s army at Lesnaya before Charles could combine his forces, thus losing valuable supplies, artillery and half of Lewenhaupt&#x27;s men. Charles&#x27;s Polish ally, Stanisław Leszczyński, was facing internal problems of his own. Charles expected the support of a massive Cossack rebellion led by Mazepa in Ukraine, with estimates suggesting Mazepa was able to muster about 40,000 troops. However, the Russians subjugated the rebellion and destroyed its capital, Baturin, before the arrival of the Swedish troops. The harsh climate took its toll as well, because Charles marched his troops to winter camp in Ukraine.

By the time of the decisive Battle of Poltava, in July 1709, Charles had been wounded, one-third of his infantry was dead, and his supply train had been destroyed. The king was incapacitated by a gunshot wound to the foot and was unable to lead the Swedish forces. With the numbers of Charles&#x27;s army reduced to some 23,000, with many wounded or involved on the siege of Poltava, his general Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld had a clearly inferior force to face the fortified and modernized army of Tsar Peter, with some 45,000 men. The Swedish assault ended in disaster, and the king fled south to the Ottoman Empire with a small entourage, and set up camp at Bender with some 1,000 of his &quot;Caroleans&quot; (&quot;Karoliner&quot; in Swedish). The remainder of the army surrendered days later at Perevolochna under Lewenhaupt&#x27;s command, most of them (including Lewenhaupt himself) spending the rest of their days in Russian captivity.

The Swedish defeat at Poltava marked the downfall of the Swedish Empire, as well as the founding of the Russian Empire.

=== Exile in the Ottoman Empire ===

The Ottomans initially welcomed the Swedish king when he went to Abdurrahman Pasha, commander of Özü Castle, as he was about to fall into the hands of the Russian army, and he was able to take refuge in the castle at the last moment. Afterward, he settled in Bender at the invitation of its governor, Ağa Yusuf Pasha.

In the meantime, Charles sent Stanisław Poniatowski and as his messengers to Constantinople. They managed to indirectly contact Gülnuş Sultan, mother of Sultan Ahmed III, who became intrigued by Charles, and took an interest in his cause, and even corresponded with him in Bender.

During his stay in the Ottoman Empire, Charles earned the nickname (literally &quot;iron-head&quot;). This word can mean stubborn or persistent, and it is usually assumed that this is why the Turks called Charles by this nickname. However, the term commonly referred to state-owned articles in general and the furniture, equipment, etc. in state offices in particular. Thus, the nickname may be an ironic reference to Charles&#x27;s visits to Ottoman government offices over a prolonged period.

Eventually, a small village named Karlstad (Varnița) had to be built near Bender to accommodate the ever-growing Swedish population there.

Gülnuş Sultan convinced her son to declare war against Russia, as she thought that Charles was a man worth taking a risk for. Later on, the Ottomans and Russians signed the Treaty of the Pruth and Treaty of Adrianople to end the hostilities between them. The treaties dissatisfied the pro-war party supported by King Charles and Stanislaw Poniatowski, who failed to reignite the conflict.

However, the Sultan Ahmed III&#x27;s subjects in the empire eventually got tired of Charles&#x27;s scheming. His entourage also accumulated huge debts with Bender merchants. Eventually, &quot;crowds&quot; of townspeople attacked the Swedish colony at Bender and Charles had to defend himself against the mobs and the Ottoman janissaries involved. This uprising was called (Turkish for crowd) which afterward found a place in Swedish lexicon referring to a ruckus. The janissaries did not shoot Charles during the skirmish at Bender, but captured him and put him under house-arrest at Dimetoka (nowadays Didimoticho) and Constantinople. During his semi-imprisonment the King played chess and studied the Ottoman Navy and the naval architecture of the Ottoman galleons. His sketches and designs eventually led to the famous Swedish war ships &quot;Jarramas&quot; (Yaramaz) and &quot;Jilderim&quot; (Yıldırım).

Meanwhile, Russia and Poland regained and expanded their borders. Great Britain, an adversary of Sweden, defected from its alliance obligations while Prussia attacked Swedish holdings in Germany. Russia occupied Finland (the Greater Wrath 1713–1721). After defeats of the Swedish army, consisting mainly of Finnish troops in the Battle of Helsinki (1713), the Battle of Pälkäne 1713 and the Battle of Storkyro 1714, the military, administration and clergymen escaped from Finland, which fell under Russian military regime.

During his five-year stay in the Ottoman Empire, Charles XII corresponded with his sister (and eventual successor), Ulrika Eleonora. According to Mrs. Ragnhild Marie Hatton, a Norwegian-British historian, in some of those letters Charles expressed his desire for a peace treaty which would be defensible in the future Swedish generations&#x27; eyes. However, he emphasized that only a greater respect for Sweden in Europe would enable him to achieve such a peace treaty. Meanwhile, the Swedish Council of State (government) and Estates/Diet (Parliament) tried to keep the beleaguered Sweden somehow organized and independent. Eventually, in the autumn of 1714, their warning letter reached him. In it, those executive and legislative bodies told the absentee King that unless he quickly returned to Sweden, they would independently conclude an achievable peace treaty with Russia, Poland and Denmark. This stark admonition prompted Charles to rush back to Sweden.

Charles traveled back to Sweden with a group of Ottomans, soldiers such as escorts and businessmen to whom he promised to repay his debts during his stay in the Ottoman Empire, but they had to wait several years before that happened. According to the prevailing church law in Sweden at that time, all who lived in the country, but were not members of the Swedish state church, would be baptized. In order for the Jewish and Muslim creditors to avoid this, Charles wrote a &quot;free letter&quot; so that they could practice their religions without being punished. The soldiers chose to remain in Sweden instead of making difficult trips home. They were called &quot;Askersson&quot; (the word &quot;asker&quot; in Turkish means soldier). However, there are accounts implying that following the long stay for Charles to repay his debts, they got paid and left the country.

===Pomerania and Norway===


Charles agreed to leave Constantinople and returned to Swedish Pomerania. He made the journey on horseback, riding across Europe in just fifteen days. He traveled across the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary to Vienna and arrived at Stralsund. A medal with Charles on horseback, his long hair flying in the wind, was struck in 1714 to commemorate the speedy ride. It reads . (&quot;What worries you so? God and I live still&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

After five years away, Charles arrived in Sweden to find his homeland at war with Russia, Saxony, Hannover, Great Britain and Denmark. Sweden&#x27;s western enemies attacked southern and western Sweden while Russian forces traveled across Finland to attack the Stockholm district. For the first time, Sweden found itself in a defensive war. Charles&#x27;s plan was to attack Denmark by striking at her possessions in Norway. It was hoped that by cutting Denmark&#x27;s Norwegian supply lines the Danes would be compelled to withdraw their forces from Swedish Scania.
Charles invaded Norway in 1716 with a combined force of 7,000 men. He occupied the capital of Christiania, (modern Oslo), and laid siege to the Akershus fortress there. Due to a lack of heavy siege cannons he was unable to dislodge the Norwegian forces inside. After suffering significant losses of men and materiel, Charles was forced to retreat from the capital on 29 April. In the following mid-May, Charles invaded again, this time striking the border town of Fredrikshald, now Halden, in an attempt to capture the fortress of Fredriksten. The attacking Swedes came under heavy cannon fire from the fortress and were forced to withdraw when the Norwegians set the town of Fredrikshald on fire. Swedish casualties in Fredrikshald were estimated at 500 men. While the siege at Fredrikshald was underway, the Swedish supply fleet was attacked and defeated by Tordenskjold in the Battle of Dynekilen.

In 1718, Charles once more invaded Norway. With a main force of 40,000 men, he again laid siege to the fortress of Fredriksten overlooking the town of Fredrikshald. Charles was shot in the head and killed during the siege, while he was inspecting trenches. The invasion was abandoned, and Charles&#x27;s body was returned to Sweden. A second force, under Carl Gustaf Armfeldt, marched against Trondheim with 10,000 men but was forced to retreat. In the march that ensued, many of the 5,800 remaining men perished in a severe winter storm.

==Death==
While in the trenches close to the perimeter of the fortress on 30 November (11 December New Style), 1718, Charles was struck in the head by a projectile and killed. The shot struck the left side of his skull and exited from the right. He died instantly.

The definitive circumstances around Charles&#x27;s death remain unclear. Despite multiple investigations of the battlefield, Charles&#x27;s skull and his clothes, it is not known where and when he was hit, or whether the shot came from the ranks of the enemy or from his own men. There are several hypotheses as to how Charles died, though none have strong enough evidence to be deemed true. Although there were many people around the king at the time of his death, there were no known witnesses to the actual moment he was hit. A likely explanation has been that Charles was killed by Dano-Norwegians as he was within reach of their guns. There are two possibilities that are usually cited: that he was killed by a musket shot, or that he was killed by grapeshot from the nearby fortress.

More theories claim he was assassinated: one is that the killer was a Swedish compatriot and asserts that enemy guns were not firing at the time Charles was struck. Suspects in this claim range from a nearby soldier tired of the siege and wanting to put an end to the war, to an assassin hired by Charles&#x27;s own brother-in-law, who profited from the event by subsequently taking the throne himself as Frederick I of Sweden, that person being Frederick&#x27;s aide-de-camp, André Sicre. Sicre confessed during what was claimed to be a state of delirium brought on by fever but later recanted. Others suspect a plot to kill Charles by a group of wealthy Swedes who would benefit from blocking a 17% wealth tax that Charles intended to introduce. The Varberg Fortress museum displays a lead-filled brass button of Swedish origin that some claim was the projectile that killed the king.

Another odd account of Charles&#x27;s death comes from Finnish writer Carl Nordling, who states that the king&#x27;s surgeon, Melchior Neumann, dreamed the king had told him that he was not shot from the fortress but from &quot;one who came creeping&quot;.

Charles&#x27;s body has been exhumed on three occasions to ascertain the cause of death; in 1746, 1859 and 1917. The 1859 exhumation found that the wound was in accordance with a shot from the Norwegian fort. In 1917, his head was photographed and x-rayed. Peter Englund asserted in his essay &quot;On the death of Charles XII and other murders&quot; that the mortal wound sustained by the King, with a smaller exit wound than entry wound, would be consistent with being hit by a bullet with a speed not exceeding 150 m/s, concluding that Charles was killed by stray grapeshot from the nearby fortress. A 2022 study by the University of Oulu and the University of Helsinki also found that iron grapeshot was likely to have killed the king, citing evidence from ballistic experiments as well as the absence of lead fragments in Charles&#x27;s skull.

Charles was succeeded to the Swedish throne by his sister, Ulrika Eleonora. As his duchy of Palatine Zweibrücken required a male heir, Charles was succeeded as ruler there by his cousin Gustav Leopold. Georg Heinrich von Görtz, Charles&#x27;s minister, was beheaded in 1719.

==Personal life==
Charles never married and fathered no children of whom historians are aware. In his youth, he was particularly encouraged to find a suitable spouse in order to secure the succession, but he would frequently avoid the subject of sex and marriage. Possible candidates included Princess Sophia Hedwig of Denmark, Louisa Maria Stuart and Princess Maria Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp – but of the latter he pleaded that he could never wed someone &quot;as ugly as Satan and with such a devilish big mouth&quot;. Instead, he made it clear that he would marry only someone of his own choice, and for love rather than dynastic pressures. His lack of mistresses may have been due to a strong religious faith. Charles himself suggested in conversation with Axel Löwen that he actively resisted any match until peace could be secured and was in some sense &quot;married&quot; to the military life. But that he was &quot;chaste&quot; occasioned speculation in his lifetime. Much later speculation that he was a hermaphrodite was quelled in 1917 when his coffin was opened and he was shown to have beard growth.

In his conversations with Löwen, he also stated that he did not lack taste for beautiful women, but that he held in his sexual desires for fear that they would get out of control if unchecked, and that if he committed to something like that, it would be forever. Some historians suggest that he resisted a marriage with Denmark which could have caused a family rift between those who dynastically favoured Holstein-Gottorp. Historians such as Blanning and Montefiore believe he was in fact homosexual. Certainly a letter from Reuterholm suggested that Charles had indicated a closeness to Prince Maximilian Emanuel of Württemberg-Winnental, whom Charles described as &quot;very pretty&quot;. But writing in the 1960s, Hatton argues that Württemberg was very much heterosexual and the relationship is just as likely to have been that of teacher-pupil.

== Legacy ==
Exceptional for abstaining from alcohol and sex, he felt most comfortable during warfare. Contemporaries report of his seemingly inhuman tolerance for pain and his utter lack of emotion. His brilliant campaigning and startling victories brought his country to the pinnacle of her prestige and power, although the Great Northern War resulted in Sweden&#x27;s defeat and the end of the empire within years of his own death. In his youth, renowned Russian general Alexander Suvorov considered Charles XII his hero together with Julius Caesar. Like Charles XII, Suvorov adopted an aggressive style of tactics and campaigning, seemingly inspired by the Swedish king.

Charles&#x27;s death marked the end of autocratic kingship in Sweden, and the subsequent Age of Liberty saw a shift of power from the monarch to the parliament of the estates. Historians of the late 18th and early 19th centuries viewed Charles&#x27;s death as the result of an aristocratic plot, and Gustav IV Adolf, the king who refused to settle with Napoleon Bonaparte, &quot;identified himself with Charles as a type of righteous man struggling with iniquity&quot; (Roberts). Throughout the 19th century&#x27;s romantic nationalism Charles XII was viewed as a national hero. He was idealized as a heroic, virtuous young warrior king, and his fight against Peter the Great was associated with the contemporary Swedish-Russian enmity. Examples of the romantic hero idolatry of Charles XII in several genres are Esaias Tegnér&#x27;s song &quot;Kung Karl, den unge hjälte&quot; (1818), Johan Peter Molin&#x27;s statue in Stockholm&#x27;s Kungsträdgården (unveiled on 30 November 1868, the 150th anniversary of Charles&#x27;s death) and Gustaf Cederström&#x27;s painting &quot;Karl XII:s likfärd&quot; (&quot;Funeral procession of Charles XII&quot;, 1878). The date of Charles&#x27;s death was chosen by a student association in Lund for annual torch marches beginning in 1853.

In his 1901 play &quot;Karl XII&quot;, August Strindberg broke with the heroization practice by showing an introverted Charles XII in conflict with his impoverished subjects. In the so-called Strindberg feud (1910–1912), his response to the &quot;Swedish cult of Charles XII&quot; (Steene) was that Charles had been &quot;Sweden&#x27;s ruin, the great offender, a ruffian, the rowdies&#x27; idol, a counterfeiter.&quot; Verner von Heidenstam however, one of his opponents in the feud, in his book &quot;Karolinerna&quot; instead &quot;emphasized the heroic steadfastness of the Swedish people in the somber years of trial during the long-drawn-out campaigns of Karl XII&quot; (Scott).

In the 1930s, the Swedish Nazis held celebrations on the date of Charles XII&#x27;s death, and shortly before the outbreak of World War II, Adolf Hitler received from Sweden a sculpture of the king at his birthday. In the late 20th century, Swedish nationalists and neo-Nazis had again used 30 November as a date for their ceremonies, however these were regularly interrupted by larger counter-demonstrations and were abandoned.

=== Scientific contributions ===
Apart from being a monarch, the King&#x27;s interests included mathematics, and anything that would be beneficial to his warlike purposes. He is credited with having invented an octal numeral system, as well as a more elaborate one with the base 64, which he considered more suitable for war purposes because all the boxes used for materials such as gunpowder were cubic. According to a report by contemporary scientist Emanuel Swedenborg, the King had sketched a model of his thoughts on a piece of paper and handed it to him at their meeting in Lund in 1716. The paper was reportedly still in existence a hundred years later but has since been lost.

===Literature===
Charles fascinated many in his time. In 1731, Voltaire wrote a biography of Charles XII, &quot;History of Charles XII&quot;. Voltaire portrays the Swedish king in a positive light, against the brutal nature of Peter the Great. The English man of letters Samuel Johnson wrote of Charles in his poem &quot;The Vanity of Human Wishes&quot;:

Swedish author Frans G. Bengtsson and Professor Ragnhild Hatton have written biographies of Charles XII of Sweden.

In 1938, E. M. Almedingen wrote &quot;The Lion of the North: Charles XII, King of Sweden&quot;.

Charles XII figures quite prominently in Robert Massie&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;Peter the Great&quot;.

== Ancestors ==

== In popular culture ==

He is referred to in the anime &quot;Legend of the Galactic Heroes&quot; as the Swedish Meteor; whose similarity to Reinhard von Lohengramm may portend the dynasty dying out without a successor.

August Strindberg&#x27;s 1901 play &quot;Carl XII&quot; is about him.

The 1925 Swedish film &quot;Charles XII&quot; is a two-part silent epic starring Gösta Ekman the Elder portraying his reign.

In the 1968 Polish film &quot;Hrabina Cosel&quot;, Charles XII is portrayed by Daniel Olbrychski.

In the 1983 Swedish comedy film &quot;&quot;, Charles XII is portrayed by Gösta Ekman the Younger.

In 2007, Charles XII was portrayed by Eduard Flerov in the Russian drama &quot;The Sovereign&#x27;s Servant&quot;.

Charles XII appears in the absurdist comedy &quot;A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence&quot; (2014), in which his army passes a modern-day cafe on their way to, and retreating from, the Battle of Poltava. He is played by Viktor Gyllenberg.

The Swedish power metal band Sabaton wrote an album named after him, which includes several songs about his life.

<text>Lothar-Günther Buchheim () (6 February 1918 – 22 February 2007) was a German author, painter, and wartime journalist under the Nazi regime. In World War II he served as a war correspondent aboard ships and U-boats. He is best known for his 1973 antiwar novel &quot;Das Boot&quot; (&quot;The Boat&quot;), based on his experiences during the war, which became an international bestseller and was adapted as the 1981 Oscar-nominated film of the same name. His artworks, collected in a gallery on the banks of the Starnberger See, range from heavily decorated cars to a variety of mannequins seated or standing as if themselves visitors to the gallery, thus challenging the division between visitor and art work.

==Early life==
Buchheim was born in Weimar, in the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (present-day Thuringia), the second son of artist Charlotte Buchheim. She was unmarried, and he was raised by his mother and her parents. They lived in Weimar until 1924, then Rochlitz until 1932, and finally Chemnitz. He began contributing to newspapers in his teens and put on an exhibition of his drawings in 1933, when he was 15.

He travelled to the Baltic Sea with his brother, and canoed along the Danube to the Black Sea. After taking his Abitur in 1937, he spent time in Italy, where he wrote his first book, &quot;Tage und Nächte steigen aus dem Strom. Eine Donaufahrt&quot; (&quot;Days and nights rise from the river. A journey on the Danube&quot;), published in 1941. He studied art in Dresden and Munich in 1939, and volunteered for the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in 1940.

==Second World War==
Buchheim was a &quot;Sonderführer&quot; in a propaganda unit of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in the Second World War, writing as a war correspondent about his experiences on minesweepers, destroyers and submarines. He also made drawings and took photographs.

As a &quot;Leutnant zur See&quot; in the autumn of 1941, Buchheim joined &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock and the crew of on her seventh patrol in the Battle of the Atlantic. His orders were to photograph and describe the U-boat in action. From his experiences, he wrote a short story, &quot;Die Eichenlaubfahrt&quot; (The Oak-Leaves Patrol; Lehmann-Willenbrock had been awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross with oak leaves). Buchheim ended the war as an &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot;.

==Post-war career==
After the war, Buchheim worked as an artist, art collector, gallery owner, art auctioneer and art publisher. Through the 1950s and 1960s, he established an art publishing house, and he wrote books on Georges Braque, Max Beckmann, Otto Mueller and Pablo Picasso. He collected works by French and German Expressionist artists, from groups including Die Brücke and Der Blaue Reiter, such as Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Pechstein, Emil Nolde, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Franz Marc, Gabriele Münter, Alexej von Jawlensky, and Max Beckmann. These works had been derided as &quot;degenerate&quot; during the Nazi period, and he was able to buy them cheaply.

In 1973 he published a novel based on his wartime experiences, &quot;&quot; (The Boat), a fictionalised autobiographical account narrated by a &quot;Leutnant Werner&quot;. It became the best-selling German fiction work on the war.

His novel was followed by a non-fiction work, &quot;U-Boot-Krieg&quot; (U-Boat War) in 1976, which became the first part of a trilogy, together with &quot;U-Boot-Fahrer&quot; (U-Boat Sailors, 1985), and &quot;Zu Tode Gesiegt&quot; (Victory in the Face of Death, 1988). The trilogy includes over 5,000 photographs taken during World War II. He subsequently also wrote the autobiographical novels &quot;Die Festung&quot; (The Fortress, 1995), a sequel to &quot;Das Boot&quot; based on his travels home across France in 1944, and &quot;Der Abschied&quot; (The Parting, 2000), about the nuclear-powered cargo vessel NS &quot;Otto Hahn&quot;.

&quot;Das Boot&quot; was turned into a film in 1981, featuring Jürgen Prochnow as the captain and the debut of Herbert Grönemeyer as &quot;Leutnant Werner&quot;. Director Wolfgang Petersen and Buchheim fell out after the author was not allowed to write the script. (Buchheim was always noted for his short temper – he was later nicknamed the &quot;Starnberg volcano&quot;.) The film was the most expensive German film ever made. It was nominated for six Oscars.

Even though impressed by the technological accuracy of the film&#x27;s set-design and port construction buildings, Buchheim expressed great disappointment with Petersen&#x27;s adaptation in a film review published in 1981, describing Petersen&#x27;s film as converting his clearly anti-war novel into a blend of a &quot;cheap, shallow American action flick&quot; and a &quot;contemporary German propaganda newsreel from World War II&quot;. He also criticised the hysterical overacting of the cast, which he called highly unrealistic, despite their talent. Buchheim, after several attempts for an American adaptation had failed, had provided his own script as soon as Petersen was chosen as new director. It would have been a six-hour epic; Petersen turned him down because the producers were aiming for a 90-minute feature for international release. However, today&#x27;s Director&#x27;s Cut of &quot;Das Boot&quot; amounts to over 200 minutes, and the complete TV version of the film is 282 minutes long.

==Art collection==
In later life, Buchheim sought a location to house his art collection, including
curiosities ranging from nutcrackers and Thai shadow puppets to mannequins and carousel animals in addition to his important collection of German Expressionist paintings and graphics. A building was constructed in Duisburg, but he considered it unfit, and he turned down offers from Weimar, Munich and Berlin. After years of quarreling with his home town of Feldafing, Bavaria, about his plans for a museum for his art collection, the town&#x27;s citizens voted against the museum in a referendum. His museum finally opened in 2001 as the Museum der Phantasie in Bernried on the shore of Lake Starnberg, funded by the government of Bavaria. The entire collection has been estimated to be worth up to $300 million.

In June 2000, the Sprengel Museum in Hanover voted to return a Lovis Corinth’s painting, “Walchensee, Johannisnacht” (“The Walchensee on St John’s eve”) which its donor, Dr. Bernhard Sprengel, had purchased from Buchheim, to the heirs of Dr Gustav Kirstein and his wife Therese Clara Stein, who committed suicide due to Nazi persecution.

== Private life and death ==
Buchheim married Geneviève &quot;Gwen&quot; Militon, a resistance fighter from Britanny who appears in his novels as Simone Sagot, and whom he also painted. They had a daughter, Nina, and a son, Yves. They divorced in 1951 and he remarried in 1955 to Diethild Wickboldt.

Despite a fortune estimated at 14.1 million Swiss francs in the late 1980s, Buchheim was known for his frugality. He used a camping table in his dining room, and according to his son, did not pay taxes and reused print blocks made by Otto Müller, forging the artist&#x27;s initials. His son published a highly critical biography in 2018.

Buchheim died of heart failure in Starnberg on 22 February 2007, at the age of 89.

<doc id="104952" wikidata="Q192881" url="?curid=104952" title="Tragicomedy">
<text>Tragicomedy is a literary genre that blends aspects of both tragic and comic forms. Most often seen in dramatic literature, the term can describe either a tragic play which contains enough comic elements to lighten the overall mood or a serious play with a happy ending. Tragicomedy, as its name implies, invokes the intended response of both the tragedy and the comedy in the audience, the former being a genre based on human suffering that invokes an accompanying catharsis and the latter being a genre intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter.

== In theatre ==
===Classical precedent===

There is no concise formal definition of tragicomedy from the classical age. It appears that the Greek philosopher Aristotle had something like the Renaissance meaning of the term (that is, a serious action with a happy ending) in mind when, in &quot;Poetics&quot;, he discusses tragedy with a dual ending. In this respect, a number of Greek and Roman plays, for instance &quot;Alcestis&quot;, may be called tragicomedies, though without any definite attributes outside of plot. The word itself originates with the Roman comic playwright Plautus, who coined the term (&quot;tragicomoedia&quot; in Latin) somewhat facetiously in the prologue to his play &quot;Amphitryon&quot;. The character Mercury, sensing the indecorum of the inclusion of both kings and gods alongside servants in a comedy, declares that the play had better be a &quot;tragicomoedia&quot;:

===Renaissance revivals===
====Italy====
Two figures helped to elevate tragicomedy to the status of a regular genre, by which is meant one with its own set of rigid rules. First was Giovanni Battista Giraldi Cinthio, a dramatist working in the mid-sixteenth century who developed a treatise on drama modeled on Roman comedies and tragedies as opposed to early Greek-based treatises that became the model for Italian dramatists at the time. He argued for a version of tragicomedy where a tragic story was told with a happy or comic ending (&quot;tragedia a lieto fine),&quot; which he thought were better suited for staged performances as opposed to tragedies with unhappy endings which he thought were better when read. Even more important was Giovanni Battista Guarini. Guarini&#x27;s &quot;Il Pastor Fido&quot;, published in 1590, provoked a fierce critical debate in which Guarini&#x27;s spirited defense of generic innovation eventually carried the day. Guarini&#x27;s tragicomedy offered modulated action that never drifted too far either to comedy or tragedy, mannered characters, and a pastoral setting. All three became staples of continental tragicomedy for a century and more.

====England====

In England, where practice ran ahead of theory, the situation was quite different. In the sixteenth century, &quot;tragicomedy&quot; meant the native sort of romantic play that violated the unities of time, place, and action, that glibly mixed high- and low-born characters, and that presented fantastic actions. These were the features Philip Sidney deplored in his complaint against the &quot;mungrell Tragy-comedie&quot; of the 1580s, and of which Shakespeare&#x27;s Polonius offers famous testimony: &quot;The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individuable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.&quot; Some aspects of this romantic impulse remain even in the work of more sophisticated playwrights: Shakespeare&#x27;s last plays, which may well be called tragicomedies, have often been called romances.

By the early Stuart period, some English playwrights had absorbed the lessons of the Guarini controversy. John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Faithful Shepherdess&quot;, an adaptation of Guarini&#x27;s play, was produced in 1608. In the printed edition, Fletcher offered a definition of the term, stating that: &quot;A tragi-comedie is not so called in respect of mirth and killing, but in respect it wants deaths, which is enough to make it no tragedy, yet brings some neere it, which is inough to make it no comedie.&quot; Fletcher&#x27;s definition focuses primarily on events: a play&#x27;s genre is determined by whether or not people die in it, and in a secondary way on how close the action comes to a death. But, as Eugene Waith showed, the tragicomedy Fletcher developed in the next decade also had unifying stylistic features: sudden and unexpected revelations, outré plots, distant locales, and a persistent focus on elaborate, artificial rhetoric.

Some of Fletcher&#x27;s contemporaries, notably Philip Massinger and James Shirley, wrote popular tragicomedies. Richard Brome also essayed the form, but with less success. And many of their contemporary writers, ranging from John Ford to Lodowick Carlell to Sir Aston Cockayne, made attempts in the genre.

Tragicomedy remained fairly popular up to the closing of the theaters in 1642, and Fletcher&#x27;s works were popular in the Restoration as well. The old styles were cast aside as tastes changed in the eighteenth century; the &quot;tragedy with a happy ending&quot; eventually developed into melodrama, in which form it still flourishes.

&quot;Landgartha&quot; (1640) by Henry Burnell, the first play by an Irish playwright to be performed in an Irish theatre, was explicitly described by its author as a tragicomedy. Critical reaction to the play was universally hostile, partly it seems because the ending was neither happy nor unhappy. Burnell in his introduction to the printed edition of the play attacked his critics for their ignorance, pointing out that as they should know perfectly well, many plays are neither tragedy nor comedy, but &quot;something between&quot;.

====Later developments====
Criticism that developed after the Renaissance stressed the thematic and formal aspects of tragicomedy, rather than plot. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing defined it as a mixture of emotions in which &quot;seriousness stimulates laughter, and pain pleasure.&quot; Tragicomedy&#x27;s affinity with satire and &quot;dark&quot; comedy have suggested a tragicomic impulse in modern theatre with Luigi Pirandello who influenced many playwrights including Samuel Beckett and Tom Stoppard. Also it can be seen in absurdist drama. Friedrich Dürrenmatt, the Swiss dramatist, suggested that tragicomedy was the inevitable genre for the twentieth century; he describes his play &quot;The Visit&quot; (1956) as a tragicomedy. Tragicomedy is a common genre in post-World War II British theatre, with authors as varied as Samuel Beckett, Tom Stoppard, John Arden, Alan Ayckbourn and Harold Pinter writing in this genre. Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s postmodern 1962 novel &quot;Pale Fire&quot; is a tragicomedy preoccupied with Elizabethan drama.

=== Postmodern tragicomedy ===
American writers of the metamodernist and postmodernist movements have made use of tragicomedy and/or gallows humor. A notable example of a metamodernist tragicomedy is David Foster Wallace&#x27;s 1996 magnum opus, &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;. Wallace writes of comedic elements of living in a halfway house (i.e. &quot;some people really do look like rodents&quot;), a place steeped in human tragedy and suffering.

== Tragicomedy in media ==
Films including &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Mary and Max&quot;, &quot;Parasite&quot;, &quot;Jojo Rabbit&quot;, &quot;The Banshees of Inisherin&quot;, &quot;Beau is Afraid&quot;, &quot;Robot Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Memoir of a Snail&quot; have been described as tragicomedies.
Television series including &quot;Succession&quot;, &quot;Killing Eve&quot;, &quot;Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul,&quot; &quot;Fleabag&quot;, &quot;I May Destroy You&quot;, &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Steven Universe Future&quot;, &quot;Moral Orel&quot;, &quot;Barry&quot;, &quot;Made for Love&quot;, and &quot;The White Lotus&quot; have also been described as tragicomedies.

<text>Clinopodium douglasii, (synonym Micromeria douglasii), yerba buena, or Oregon tea is a rambling aromatic herb of western and northwestern North America, ranging from British Columbia southwards to Southern California and from the Pacific coast eastwards to western Montana. The plant takes the form of a sprawling, mat-forming perennial. The name &quot;yerba buena&quot; derives from Spanish for &quot;good herb&quot; and is applied to various other plants.

== Description ==

&quot;Clinopodium douglasii&quot; is a decumbent perennial herb. Leaves are in an opposite arrangement along the stem, and each leaf is subtended by a petiole, is relatively small in size, and ovate to almost triangular in shape, with the leaf margin being shallowly toothed. Flowers occur at the leaf axils, and are solitary (occasionally a cluster of 2-3 flowers) on a short pedicel. The flower consists of a tubular calyx that subtends a lobed, bilaterally symmetrical, labiate corolla typical of the mint family, white to lavender in color, and typically 3-8 millimeters in length. The inner flower, found under the upper &quot;lip&quot; of the corolla, consists of 2 fused styles with a 2-lobed stigma and 4 exserted stamens arranged in 2 pairs. The fruit is a tiny nutlet with a smooth surface. The leaves and other parts of the plant are strongly aromatic and have a minty odor.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Clinopodium douglasii&quot; is native to the western United States and Canada, ranging from western British Columbia to southern California and parts of the interior mountain ranges of the Pacific Northwest and northern California. The coastal and interior mountain distributions of this species are largely disjunct, and it is largely absent from the dry interior regions between these areas, such as the Interior and Columbia Plateaus and California&#x27;s Central Valley.

The northern limit of the natural distribution of this species is in British Columbia, in the eastern and southern part of Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, as well as nearby mainland areas along the Salish Sea. In western Washington and Oregon, &quot;C. douglasii&quot; ranges from the western side of the Cascade Range westward through the San Juan Islands, the Puget Lowland, and the Williamette Valley to the Olympic Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges, though it is relatively less frequent near to the Pacific coast. Southward from southwestern Oregon and into California, the distribution gradually becomes more coastal, ranging from the Pacific coast into the Klamath Mountains and California Coast Ranges. It is commonly found as far south as the Santa Monica Mountains and Santa Catalina Island. There is also a single collection of &quot;C. douglasii&quot; reported from Juneau, Alaska, but this is thought to be the result of an introduction, and this species is not otherwise found that far north.

&quot;C. douglasii&quot; is also found in the moist western ranges of the interior mountains of the Pacific Northwest, such as the Columbia Mountains, the westernmost subranges of the Rocky Mountains, and the Blue and Wallowa Mountains, ranging from the British Columbia Interior south to northeastern Oregon and as far east as northern Idaho and western Montana. In California, it occurs occasionally in the western side of the northern Sierra Nevada.

== History ==
&quot;Clinopodium douglasii&quot; was widely used by the indigenous peoples of California and the Pacific Northwest Coast, generally in the form of a tea, both as a medicine and as a beverage. Ethnobotanical records of use of the plant are recorded among many indigenous peoples ranging from the Saanich of British Columbia to the Luiseño and Cahuilla of southern California. Later Spanish- and English-speaking settlers learned of the uses of this plant from native peoples and incorporated it into their own folk medicine traditions. Spanish missionaries gave the name &quot;yerba buena&quot; or &quot;hierba buena&quot; (good herb) to the plant, a Spanish common name for spearmint and other edible mints.

The herb has had a long association with the history of San Francisco. In 1776, Pedro Font, the Franciscan chaplain of the de Anza Expedition, noted the abundance of &quot;hierba buena&quot; around the expedition&#x27;s encampment at Mountain Lake, near to the Presidio of San Francisco, for which the expedition was tasked with finding a site. In the Spanish and Mexican eras of San Francisco, the undeveloped northwestern corner of San Francisco, where the plant was abundant, was given the name &quot;El Paraje de Yerba Buena&quot; (Place of the Yerba Buena). The area included Yerba Buena Cove, a favored anchorage, and the name was later extended to the &quot;Isla de la Yerba Buena&quot; (Yerba Buena Island), which faced the cove. In 1835, the civilian &quot;pueblo&quot; of Yerba Buena was founded on the shores of the cove, which would later grow into the American city of San Francisco. &quot;Yerba Buena&quot; is still used for many place names in the San Francisco area.

== Taxonomy ==
=== Early collections and type specimen ===

In 1816, the &quot;Rurik&quot; expedition visited San Francisco and its chief botanist, Adelbert von Chamisso, made the first scientific collections of this species. These botanical specimens were eventually sent to George Bentham, a botanist specializing in the mint family, for botanical diagnosis. Bentham examined these specimens for his initial publication of this species and in latter work on this species, also examined collections made by Archibald Menzies, David Douglas, and John Scouler, among others. By the 20th century, the initial collections made by von Chamisso were lost, and in 1927 Carl Epling selected an early collection made by David Douglas in 1825 at Cape Disappointment, near the mouth of the Columbia River, as the neotype specimen. This type specimen is currently deposited in Kew Herbarium.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
George Bentham examined von Chamisso&#x27;s 1816 collections from San Francisco and made the first publication of the species name in 1831, initially recognizing the samples as belonging to two related but different species, &quot;Thymus Chamissonis&quot; (named for von Chamisso) and &quot;Thymus Douglasii&quot; (named in honor of David Douglas). In 1834, Bentham transferred the species from &quot;Thymus&quot; to &quot;Micromeria&quot; and merged the two species under the name &quot;Micromeria Douglassii&quot;. Bentham had initially separated the two based on small differences in leaf shape and position, but after examining more specimens, decided that what he had called &quot;Thymus Chamissonis&quot; was simply an ecotypic variation caused by growing in a more open environment than the specimen of &quot;Thymus Douglasii&quot; that he&#x27;d first examined. In 1842, Friedrich Ernst Ludwig von Fischer and Carl Anton von Meyer described a collection of yerba buena made at Fort Ross as a separate species, &quot;Micromeria barbata&quot;, based on the hairy inner surface of the corolla tube. This differentiation has not been generally accepted by later authors, who regard it as a synonym of &quot;Micromeria&quot; or &quot;Clinopodium douglasii&quot;.

When Bentham transferred this species to &quot;Micromeria&quot;, he placed it in a newly described section, &quot;Micromeria&quot; sect. &quot;Hesperothymus&quot;, alongside other species such as &quot;Micromeria Brownei&quot;, based largely on the arrangement of flowers (mostly solitary pedicellate flowers found at the leaf axils), as well as the presence of more or less dentate leaf margins and the often prostrate, spreading habit of the plant overall. The subgeneric classification of this species in sect. &quot;Hesperothymus&quot; was adhered to by botanical authors through the 19th and 20th centuries, however, the generic classification of sect. &quot;Hesperothymus&quot; varied considerably between authors, leading to this species being placed in a number of genera over its history. In the 1890s, Otto Kuntze and John Isaac Briquet argued that many of Bentham&#x27;s mint family genera were poorly defined and pursued a lumping classification strategy, with Kuntze placing all sections of &quot;Micromeria&quot; within &quot;Clinopodium&quot; and Briquet placing them in &quot;Satureja&quot;. While Kuntze argued that the name &quot;Clinopodium&quot; had priority due to its use by pre-Linnean authors, Briquet&#x27;s classification system proved more popular with later taxonomists. 

For the next century following Briquet&#x27;s publication, the names &quot;Micromeria douglasii&quot;, &quot;Micromeria chamissonis&quot;, and &quot;Satureja douglasii&quot; were all in use by various botanical authors. Usage depended on whether the author accepted Bentham&#x27;s concept of the genus &quot;Micromeria&quot; or Briquet&#x27;s broader concept of &quot;Satureja&quot;, and also on some disagreement as to whether the species epithet &quot;chamissonis&quot; or &quot;douglasii&quot; took priority, as both names had been found in the original publication of this species. New discoveries of Lamiaceae species through the 20th century that did not fit well into Bentham&#x27;s generic concepts led to more plant taxonomists (particularly in North America) embracing the broader genus concept of &quot;Satureja&quot; by the latter half of the 20th century, and use of the name &quot;Satureja douglasii&quot; for this species overwhelmingly predominated in field guides and regional floras as a result.

=== Molecular phylogenetic work and current status ===

Beginning in the 1990s, the growth of molecular phylogenetics led to the findings that existing concepts of &quot;Satureja&quot; and &quot;Micromeria&quot; were polyphyletic and led to more circumscribed monophyletic definitions of these genera. In 1995, Philip D. Cantino and Steven J. Wagstaff, carried out the first molecular phylogenetic tree that included this species, based on a restriction site analysis. They concluded that &quot;Calamintha&quot; and a number of New World Mentheae genera and species, including then-&quot;Satureja douglasii&quot;, formed a distinct clade separate from &quot;Satureja&quot; sensu stricto (represented by &quot;Satureja montana&quot;) and from &quot;Micromeria&quot;. In 1998, they recommended use of &quot;Clinopodium&quot; as a synonym for &quot;Calamintha&quot; and that the former was the older name that took priority, and that species of sect. &quot;Hesperothymus&quot; also be transferred to a new, broadly-defined genus &quot;Clinopodium&quot;, specifically listing &quot;Clinopodium douglasii&quot; (Benth.) Kuntze as the preferred name for this species. This concept of &quot;Clinopodium&quot; was endorsed in later synoptical works on the family Lamiaceae and the genus &quot;Micromeria&quot; published in the 2000s.

In 2010, Christian Bräuchler and coauthors published a large scale molecular phylogenetic analysis of the subtribe Menthinae based on DNA sequencing of both nuclear ITS and several regions of chloroplast DNA. The resulting phylogeny showed strong support for three distinct clades within the Menthinae: &quot;Satureja&quot;, &quot;Micromeria&quot;, and a &quot;&quot;Clinopodium&quot; group&quot; that included a &quot;New World&quot; subgroup that in turn included &quot;Clinopodium douglasii&quot; along with a number of other New World species, variously under the name &quot;Clinopodium&quot; and the names of 22 other genera. The relationship of &quot;C. douglasii&quot; to other members of the New World group was not well-resolved in this analysis. The polyphyletic nature of &quot;Clinopodium&quot; was acknowledged, but no further name changes were recommended until systematic nomenclatural work was carried out on this complex group. In the 2010s, further molecular phylogenetic work on the subtribe Menthinae by Bryan T. Drew and Kenneth J. Sytsma using various chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequences more clearly resolved the cladistic structure of this group and the relationships of &quot;Clinopodium douglasii&quot;.

The phylogeny depicted below is based on those outlined in Bräuchler (2010), Drew &amp; Sytsma (2012), and Drew, et al. (2017), and follows the cladistic terminology given in Bräuchler (2010):

The New World group includes &quot;Clinopodium douglasii&quot; and a large number of other species of &quot;Clinopodium&quot; sensu lato, as well as 22 named genera. Within the New World group, the phylogenetic trees in the papers by Drew, et al. suggest a relationship between &quot;C. douglasii&quot; and several South American species currently classified as &quot;Clinopodium&quot;, such as &quot;C. sericifolium&quot; and &quot;C. taxifolium&quot;, as well as the South American genus &quot;Minthostachys&quot;.

, Plants of the World Online continued to place the species in the genus &quot;Micromeria&quot;, though databases such as the Jepson Herbarium eFlora, iNaturalist, Calflora, and the USDA PLANTS Database place the species in &quot;Clinopodium&quot;.

== Uses ==

This species was used by native groups throughout its range of occurrence, from Southern California to western British Columbia, both as a beverage and a medicine. The most widespread use was as a mint-flavored tea consumed as a beverage, a use that was taken up by non-native settlers as well. The herb was also used as a medicine, particularly as a treatment for colds and fevers, for abdominal pain and colic, and as a &quot;blood purifier&quot; or as &quot;good for the kidneys&quot;. Prepared in the form of a strong decoction or infused in goat&#x27;s milk, yerba buena was used as an anthelmintic by the Rumsen and Mutsen Ohlone and the Chumash, as well as by Mission Indians and Californios in the Central Coast area of California. The Hoopa and Karok peoples are reported to have sometimes worn vines of the plant around their neck or in their hair as a fragrance, while native people of the Oregon coast are said to have used the aromatic plant to disguise their scent when hunting.
