<text>Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman (; née Perkins; July 3, 1860 – August 17, 1935), also known by her first married name Charlotte Perkins Stetson, was an American humanist, novelist, writer, lecturer, early sociologist, advocate for social reform, and eugenicist. She was a utopian feminist and served as a role model for future generations of feminists because of her unorthodox concepts and lifestyle. Her works were primarily focused on gender, specifically gendered labor division in society, and the problem of male domination. She has been inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Her best remembered work today is her semi-autobiographical short story &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;, which she wrote after a severe bout of postpartum psychosis.

==Early life==
Gilman was born on July 3, 1860, in Hartford, Connecticut, to Mary Fitch Westcott and Frederic Beecher Perkins. She had only one brother, Thomas Adie, who was fourteen months older, because a physician advised Mary Perkins that she might die if she bore other children. During Charlotte&#x27;s infancy, her father moved out and abandoned his wife and children, and the remainder of her childhood was spent in poverty.

Since their mother was unable to support the family on her own, the Perkinses were often in the presence of her father&#x27;s aunts, namely Isabella Beecher Hooker, a suffragist; Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;; and Catharine Beecher, educationalist.
Her schooling was erratic: she attended seven different schools, for a cumulative total of just four years, ending when she was fifteen. Her mother was not affectionate with her children. To keep them from getting hurt as she had been, she forbade her children from making strong friendships or reading fiction. In her autobiography, &quot;The Living of Charlotte Perkins Gilman&quot;, Gilman wrote that her mother showed affection only when she thought her young daughter was asleep. Although she lived a childhood of isolated, impoverished loneliness, she unknowingly prepared herself for the life that lay ahead by frequently visiting the public library and studying physics, literature, history (particularly ancient civilizations) on her own. Her father&#x27;s love for literature influenced her, and years later he contacted her with a list of books he felt would be worthwhile for her to read.

Much of Gilman&#x27;s youth was spent in Providence, Rhode Island. What friends she had were mainly male, and she was unashamed, for her time, to call herself a &quot;tomboy&quot;.

Her natural intelligence and breadth of knowledge always impressed her teachers, who were nonetheless disappointed in her because she was a poor student. Her favorite subject was &quot;natural philosophy&quot;, especially what later would become known as physics. In 1878, the eighteen-year-old enrolled in classes at the Rhode Island School of Design with the monetary help of her absent father, and subsequently supported herself as an artist of trade cards. She was a tutor, and encouraged others to expand their artistic creativity. She was also a painter.

During her time at the Rhode Island School of Design, Gilman met Martha Luther in about 1879 and was believed to be in a romantic relationship with Luther. Gilman described the close relationship she had with Luther in her autobiography: 

Letters between the two women chronicles their lives from 1883 to 1889 and contains over 50 letters, including correspondence, illustrations and manuscripts. They pursued their relationship until Luther ended the relationship in order to marry a man in 1881. Gilman was devastated and detested romance and love until she met her first husband.

==Overcoming personal challenges==

&quot;Rest cure treatment&quot; was a medical treatment popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries primarily for women suffering from symptoms like fatigue, anxiety, and depression. The rest cure was developed by Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell, a neurologist, in the late 19th century. The treatment typically involved a strict regimen of bed rest, isolation from mental and physical stimulation, limited social interaction, and a highly regulated diet. Patients were often confined to bed for weeks or even months at a time, with minimal physical activity and intellectual stimulation. The treatment was controversial and had mixed results. While some patients reported improvement in their symptoms, others experienced worsening mental health and physical debilitation due to prolonged inactivity and social isolation. It is now considered outdated and potentially harmful in many cases.

Perkins-Gilman married Charles Stetson in 1884, and less than a year later gave birth to their daughter Katharine. Already susceptible to depression, her symptoms were exacerbated by marriage and motherhood. A good proportion of her diary entries from the time she gave birth to her daughter until several years later describe the oncoming depression that she was to face.

After nine weeks, Gilman was sent home with Mitchell&#x27;s instructions, &quot;Live as domestic a life as possible. Have your child with you all the time... Lie down an hour after each meal. Have but two hours&#x27; intellectual life a day. And never touch pen, brush or pencil as long as you live.&quot; She tried for a few months to follow Mitchell&#x27;s advice, but her depression deepened, and Gilman came perilously close to a full emotional collapse. Her remaining sanity was on the line and she began to display suicidal behavior that involved talk of pistols and chloroform, as recorded in her husband&#x27;s diaries. By early summer the couple had decided that a divorce was necessary for her to regain sanity without affecting the lives of her husband and daughter.

During the summer of 1888, Charlotte and Katharine spent time in Bristol, Rhode Island, away from Walter, and it was there where her depression began to lift. She writes of herself noticing positive changes in her attitude. She returned to Providence in September. She sold property that had been left to her in Connecticut, and went with a friend, Grace Channing, to Pasadena where the recovery of her depression can be seen through the transformation of her intellectual life.

Along with many women during the late 19th century, Perkins-Gilman dealt with the trauma of the rest cure treatment due to the lack of societal attitudes, limited understanding of mental health, and the authority of the medical profession. However, as awareness and understanding of mental health improved over time, the rest cure fell out of favor, recognized as an outdated and potentially harmful approach to treatment.

==Adulthood==
In 1884, she married the artist Charles Walter Stetson, after initially declining his proposal because her intuition told her it was not the right thing for her. Their only child, Katharine Beecher Stetson (1885–1979), was born the following year on March 23, 1885. Charlotte Perkins Gilman suffered a serious bout of postpartum depression. This was an age in which women were seen as &quot;hysterical&quot; and &quot;nervous&quot; beings; thus, when a woman claimed to be seriously ill after giving birth, her claims were sometimes dismissed.

Gilman moved to Southern California with her daughter Katherine and lived with friend Grace Ellery Channing. In 1888, Charlotte separated from her husband—a rare occurrence in the late nineteenth century. They officially divorced in 1894. After their divorce, Stetson married Channing. During the year she left her husband, Charlotte met Adeline Knapp, called &quot;Delle&quot;. Cynthia J. Davis describes how the two women had a serious relationship. She writes that Gilman &quot;believed that in Delle she had found a way to combine loving and living, and that with a woman as life mate she might more easily uphold that combination than she would in a conventional heterosexual marriage.&quot; The relationship ultimately came to an end. Following the separation from her husband, Gilman moved with her daughter to Pasadena, California, where she became active in feminist and reformist organizations such as the Pacific Coast Women&#x27;s Press Association, the Woman&#x27;s Alliance, the Economic Club, the Ebell Society (named after Adrian John Ebell), the Parents Association, and the State Council of Women, in addition to writing and editing the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, a journal published by one of the earlier-mentioned organizations.

In 1894, Gilman sent her daughter east to live with her former husband and his second wife, her friend Grace Ellery Channing. Gilman reported in her memoir that she was happy for the couple, since Katharine&#x27;s &quot;second mother was fully as good as the first, [and perhaps] better in some ways.&quot; Gilman also held progressive views about paternal rights and acknowledged that her ex-husband &quot;had a right to some of [Katharine&#x27;s] society&quot; and that Katharine &quot;had a right to know and love her father.&quot;

After her mother died in 1893, Gilman decided to move back east for the first time in eight years. She contacted Houghton Gilman, her first cousin, whom she had not seen in roughly fifteen years, who was a Wall Street attorney. They began spending time together almost immediately and became romantically involved. While she went on lecture tours, Houghton and Charlotte exchanged letters and spent as much time as they could together before she left. In her diaries, she describes him as being &quot;pleasurable&quot; and it is clear that she was deeply interested in him. From their wedding in 1900 until 1922, they lived in New York City. Their marriage was very different from her first one. In 1922, Gilman moved from New York to Houghton&#x27;s old homestead in Norwich, Connecticut. Following Houghton&#x27;s sudden death from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1934, Gilman moved back to Pasadena, California, where her daughter lived.

In January 1932, Gilman was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer. An advocate of euthanasia for the terminally ill, Gilman died by suicide on August 17, 1935, by taking an overdose of chloroform. In both her autobiography and suicide note, she wrote that she &quot;chose chloroform over cancer&quot; and she died quickly and quietly.

==Career==
At one point, Gilman supported herself by selling soap door to door. After moving to Pasadena, Gilman became active in organizing social reform movements. As a delegate, she represented California in 1896 at both the National American Woman Suffrage Association convention in Washington, D.C., and the International Socialist and Labor Congress in London. In 1890, she was introduced to the Nationalist Clubs movement which worked to &quot;end capitalism&#x27;s greed and distinctions between classes while promoting a peaceful, ethical, and truly progressive human race.&quot; Published in the &quot;Nationalist&quot; magazine, her poem &quot;Similar Cases&quot; was a satirical review of people who resisted social change, and she received positive feedback from critics for it. Throughout that same year, 1890, she became inspired enough to write fifteen essays, poems, a novella, and the short story &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;. Her career was launched when she began lecturing on Nationalism and gained the public&#x27;s eye with her first volume of poetry, &quot;In This Our World&quot;, published in 1893. As a successful lecturer who relied on giving speeches as a source of income, her fame grew along with her social circle of similar-minded activists and writers of the feminist movement.

Over the course of her career, in addition to publishing poems and fiction, Gilman published six significant books of non-fiction; a contribution which led her to be seen as one of the “women founders” of the discipline of sociology. These works, and additional published journal articles, exposed both gender and class inequality, criticizing it as illegitimate and unfair. She was a member of the American Sociological Association from the time of its founding in 1905 to her death in 1935.

===&quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;===
In 1890, Gilman wrote her short story &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;, which is now the all-time best selling book of the Feminist Press. She wrote it on June 6 and 7, 1890, in her home of Pasadena, and it was printed a year and a half later in the January 1892 issue of &quot;The New England Magazine&quot;. Since its original printing, it has been anthologized in numerous collections of women&#x27;s literature, American literature, and textbooks, though not always in its original form. For instance, many textbooks omit the phrase &quot;in marriage&quot; from a very important line in the beginning of story: &quot;John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.&quot; The reason for this omission is a mystery, as Gilman&#x27;s views on marriage are made clear throughout the story.

The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband for the sake of her health. She becomes obsessed with the room&#x27;s revolting yellow wallpaper. Gilman wrote this story to change people&#x27;s minds about the role of women in society, illustrating how women&#x27;s lack of autonomy is detrimental to their mental, emotional, and even physical wellbeing. This story was inspired by her treatment from her first husband. The narrator in the story must do as her husband (who is also her doctor) demands, although the treatment he prescribes contrasts directly with what she truly needs—mental stimulation and the freedom to escape the monotony of the room to which she is confined. &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; was essentially a response to the doctor (Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell) who had tried to cure her of her depression through a &quot;rest cure&quot; and who is mentioned in the story: &quot;John says if I don’t pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell in the fall.&quot; She sent him a copy of the story.

=== &quot;The Home: Its Work and Influence&quot; ===
In 1903 Charlotte Perkins Gilman published a non-fiction book &quot;The Home: Its Work and Influence&quot;. In this influential work, Gilman explores the role of the home in society and its impact on individuals, particularly women. She challenges traditional gender roles and argues for greater autonomy and fulfillment for women beyond domestic responsibilities. Gilman critiques the notion of the home as solely a woman&#x27;s domain and advocates for social and economic reforms to empower women and improve their well-being. &quot;The Home: Its Work and Influence&quot; is a seminal text in the early feminist movement and continues to be studied for its insights into gender, society, and the domestic sphere.

=== &quot;The Crux&quot; ===

The Crux is an important early feminist work of fiction that brings to the fore complicated issues of gender, citizenship, eugenics, and frontier nationalism. First published serially in the feminist journal The Forerunner in 1910, The Crux tells the story of a group of New England women who move west to start a boardinghouse for men in Colorado. The innocent central character, Vivian Lane, falls in love with Morton Elder, who has both gonorrhea and syphilis. The concern of the novel is not so much that Vivian will catch syphilis, but that, if she were to marry and have children with Morton, she would harm the &quot;national stock.&quot; The novel was written, in Gilman&#x27;s words, as a &quot;story . . . for young women to read . . . in order that they may protect themselves and their children to come.&quot; What was to be protected was the civic imperative to produce &quot;pureblooded&quot; citizens for a utopian ideal.

=== &quot;Suffrage Songs and Verses&quot; ===
&quot;Suffrage Songs and Verses&quot; is a collection of poems and songs written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, published during the suffrage movement in the early 20th century. In this collection, Gilman uses her poetic voice to advocate for women&#x27;s rights, particularly the right to vote. Through verse, she expresses the frustrations of women who were denied political participation and calls for gender equality. The poems celebrate the strength, resilience, and determination of suffragists while critiquing the patriarchal society that oppresses women. &quot;Suffrage Songs and Verses&quot; serves as both a literary work and a rallying cry for the suffrage movement, capturing the spirit and passion of the activists who fought for women&#x27;s enfranchisement.

== Other notable works ==

=== &quot;&quot;Art Gems for the Home and Fireside&quot;/ &quot;This Our World&quot;&quot; ===
In 1888 Perkins-Gilman published her first book, &quot;Art Gems for the Home and Fireside&quot; (1888); however, it was her first volume of poetry, &quot;In This Our World&quot; (1893), a collection of satirical poems, that first brought her recognition. During the next two decades she gained much of her fame with lectures on women&#x27;s issues, ethics, labor, human rights, and social reform. She often referred to these themes in her fiction. Her lecture tours took her across the United States.

=== &quot;Women and Economics&quot; ===
In 1894–95 Gilman served as editor of the magazine &quot;The Impress&quot;, a literary weekly that was published by the Pacific Coast Women&#x27;s Press Association (formerly the &quot;Bulletin&quot;). For the twenty weeks the magazine was printed, she was consumed in the satisfying accomplishment of contributing its poems, editorials, and other articles. The short-lived paper&#x27;s printing came to an end as a result of a social bias against her lifestyle which included being an unconventional mother and a woman who had divorced a man. After a four-month-long lecture tour that ended in April 1897, Gilman began to think more deeply about sexual relationships and economics in American life, eventually completing the first draft of &quot;Women and Economics&quot; (1898). This book discussed the role of women in the home, arguing for changes in the practices of child-raising and housekeeping to alleviate pressures from women and potentially allow them to expand their work to the public sphere. She argued that separate spheres are unfair due to 3 reasons. First, women are not truly men&#x27;s economic partners. Second, women&#x27;s economic profit comes from “sex attraction” for example marrying up. Third, the contradictions of motherhood, to attract a man a woman must behave timid and weak, yet be a good mother, she must be strong and determined. Her solution to this is baby gardens, community kitchens, hiring domestic help, and training children better. The book was published in the following year and propelled Gilman into the international spotlight. In 1903, she addressed the International Congress of Women in Berlin. The next year, she toured in England, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.

=== &quot;The Home: Its Work and Influence&quot; ===
In 1903 she wrote one of her most critically acclaimed books, &quot;The Home: Its Work and Influence&quot;, which expanded upon &quot;Women and Economics&quot;, proposing that women are oppressed in their home and that the environment in which they live needs to be modified in order to be healthy for their mental states. In between traveling and writing, her career as a literary figure was secured.

=== &quot;&quot;The Forerunner&quot;,&quot; ===
From 1909 to 1916 Gilman single-handedly wrote and edited her own magazine, &quot;The Forerunner&quot;, in which much of her fiction appeared. By presenting material in her magazine that would &quot;stimulate thought&quot;, &quot;arouse hope, courage and impatience&quot;, and &quot;express ideas which need a special medium&quot;, she aimed to go against the mainstream media which was overly sensational. Over seven years and two months the magazine produced eighty-six issues, each twenty eight pages long. The magazine had nearly 1,500 subscribers and featured such serialized works as &quot;What Diantha Did&quot; (1910), &quot;The Crux&quot; (1911), &quot;Moving the Mountain&quot; (1911), and &quot;Herland&quot; (1915). The &quot;Forerunner&quot; has been cited as being &quot;perhaps the greatest literary accomplishment of her long career&quot;. After its seven years, she wrote hundreds of articles that were submitted to the &quot;Louisville Herald&quot;, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, and the &quot;Buffalo Evening News&quot;. Her autobiography, &quot;The Living of Charlotte Perkins Gilman&quot;, which she began to write in 1925, was published posthumously in 1935.

==Social theories==

=== Reform Darwinism and the role of women in society ===
Gilman called herself a humanist and was an early contributor to the discipline of sociology and to feminist theory. She believed the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society. Gilman embraced the theory of reform Darwinism and argued that Darwin&#x27;s theories of evolution presented only the male as the given in the process of human evolution, thus overlooking the origins of the female brain in society that rationally chose the best suited mate that they could find.

Gilman argued that male aggressiveness and maternal roles for women were artificial and no longer necessary for survival in post-prehistoric times. She wrote, &quot;There is no female mind. The brain is not an organ of sex. Might as well speak of a female liver.&quot;

Her main argument was that sex and domestic economics went hand in hand; for a woman to survive, she was reliant on her sexual assets to please her husband so that he would financially support his family. From childhood, young girls are forced into a social constraint that prepares them for motherhood by the toys that are marketed to them and the clothes designed for them. She argued that there should be no difference in the clothes that little girls and boys wear, the toys they play with, or the activities they do, and described tomboys as perfect humans who ran around and used their bodies freely and healthily.

Gilman argued that women&#x27;s contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an androcentric culture. She believed that womankind was the underdeveloped half of humanity, and improvement was necessary to prevent the deterioration of the human race. Gilman believed economic independence is the only thing that could really bring freedom for women and make them equal to men. In 1898 she published &quot;Women and Economics&quot;, a theoretical treatise which argued, among other things, that women are subjugated by men, that motherhood should not preclude a woman from working outside the home, and that housekeeping, cooking, and child care, would be professionalized. &quot;The ideal woman,&quot; Gilman wrote, &quot;was not only assigned a social role that locked her into her home, but she was also expected to like it, to be cheerful and gay, smiling and good-humored.&quot; When the sexual-economic relationship ceases to exist, life on the domestic front would certainly improve, as frustration in relationships often stems from the lack of social contact that the domestic wife has with the outside world.

Gilman became a spokesperson on topics such as women&#x27;s perspectives on work, dress reform, and family. Housework, she argued, should be equally shared by men and women, and that at an early age women should be encouraged to be independent. In many of her major works, including &quot;The Home&quot; (1903), &quot;Human Work&quot; (1904), and &quot;The Man-Made World&quot; (1911), Gilman also advocated women working outside of the home.

Gilman argued that the home should be socially redefined. The home should shift from being an &quot;economic entity&quot; where a married couple live together because of the economic benefit or necessity, to a place where groups of men and groups of women can share in a &quot;peaceful and permanent expression of personal life.&quot;

Gilman believed having a comfortable and healthy lifestyle should not be restricted to married couples; all humans need a home that provides these amenities. She suggested that a communal type of housing open to both males and females, consisting of rooms, rooms of suites and houses, should be constructed. This would allow individuals to live singly and still have companionship and the comforts of a home. Both males and females would be totally economically independent in these living arrangements allowing for marriage to occur without either the male or the female&#x27;s economic status having to change.

The structural arrangement of the home is also redefined by Gilman. She removes the kitchen from the home, leaving rooms to be arranged and extended in any form and freeing women from the provision of meals in the home. The home would become a true personal expression of the individual living in it.

Ultimately the restructuring of the home and manner of living will allow individuals, especially women, to become an &quot;integral part of the social structure, in close, direct, permanent connection with the needs and uses of society.&quot; That would be a dramatic change for women, who generally considered themselves restricted by family life built upon their economic dependence on men.

===Feminism in stories and novellas===

Gilman created a world in many of her stories with a feminist point of view. Two of her narratives, &quot;What Diantha Did&quot;, and &quot;Herland&quot;, are good examples of Gilman focusing her work on how women are not just stay-at-home mothers they are expected to be; they are also people who have dreams, who are able to travel and work just as men do, and whose goals include a society where women are just as important as men. The world-building that is executed by Gilman, as well as the characters in these two stories and others, embody the change that was needed in the early 1900s in a way that is now commonly seen as feminism.

Gilman uses world-building in &quot;Herland&quot; to demonstrate the equality that she longed to see. The women of Herland are the providers as there are no men in their society. This makes them appear to be the dominant sex, taking over the gender roles that are typically given to men. Elizabeth Keyser notes, &quot;In &quot;Herland&quot; the supposedly superior sex becomes the inferior or disadvantaged ...&quot; In this utopian world, the women reproduce asexually and consider it an honor to be mothers. Unlike the patriarchal society that exists outside of Herland, the women do not have surnames for themselves or their children, as they do not believe that human beings should be &quot;claimed&quot; by others. In this society, Gilman makes it to where women are focused on having leadership within the community, fulfilling roles that are stereotypically seen as being male roles, and running an entire community without the same attitudes that men have concerning their work and the community. However, the attitude men carried concerning women were degrading, especially by progressive women, like Gilman. Using &quot;Herland&quot;, Gilman challenged this stereotype, and made the society of Herland a type of paradise. Gilman uses this story to confirm the stereotypically devalued qualities of women are valuable, show strength, and shatters traditional utopian structure for future works. Essentially, Gilman creates Herland&#x27;s society to have women hold all the power, showing more equality in this world, alluding to changes she wanted to see in her lifetime.

Gilman&#x27;s feministic approach differs from &quot;Herland&quot; in &quot;What Diantha Did&quot;. One character in this story, Diantha, breaks through the traditional expectation of women, showing Gilman&#x27;s desires for what a woman would be able to do in real-life society. Throughout the story, Gilman portrays Diantha as a character who strikes through the image of businesses in the U.S., who challenges gender norms and roles, and who believed that women could provide the solution to the corruption in big business in society. Gilman chooses to have Diantha choose a career that is stereotypically not one a woman would have because in doing so, she is showing that the salaries and wages of traditional women&#x27;s jobs are unfair. Diantha&#x27;s choice to run a business allows her to come out of the shadows and join society. Gilman&#x27;s works, especially her work with &quot;What Diantha Did&quot;, are a call for change, a battle cry that would cause panic in men and power in women. Gilman used her work as a platform for a call to change, as a way to reach women and have them begin the movement toward freedom.

===Race===
In 1908, Gilman published an article in the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot; in which she set out her views on what she perceived to be a &quot;sociological problem&quot; concerning the condition of the large Black American minority in America. Although calling Black Americans &quot;a large body of aliens&quot; whose skin color made them &quot;widely dissimilar and in many respects inferior,&quot; Gilman claimed that the economic and social situation of Black Americans was &quot;to us a social injury&quot; and noted that slavery meant that it was the responsibility of White Americans to alleviate this situation, observing that if White Americans &quot;cannot so behave as to elevate and improve [Black Americans]&quot;, then it would be the case that &quot;White Americans&quot; would &quot;need some scheme of race betterment&quot; rather than vice versa. Gilman was unequivocal about the ills of slavery and the wrongs which many White Americans had done to Black Americans, stating that irrespective of any crimes committed by Black Americans, &quot;[Whites] were the original offender, and have a list of injuries to [Black Americans], greatly outnumbering the counter list.&quot; She proposed that those Black Americans who were not &quot;self-supporting&quot; or who were &quot;actual criminals&quot; (which she clearly distinguished from &quot;the decent, self-supporting, progressive negroes&quot;) could be &quot;enlisted&quot; into a quasi-military state labour force, which she viewed as akin to conscription in certain countries. Such force would be deployed in &quot;modern agriculture&quot; and infrastructure, and those who had eventually acquired adequate skills and training &quot;would be graduated with honor&quot; – Gilman believed that any such conscription should be &quot;compulsory at the bottom, perfectly free at the top.&quot;

Gilman&#x27;s racism led her to espouse eugenicist beliefs, claiming that Old Stock Americans were surrendering their country to immigrants who were diluting the nation&#x27;s racial purity. When asked about her stance on the matter during a trip to London she declared &quot;I am an Anglo-Saxon before everything.&quot; In an effort to gain the vote for all women, she spoke out against literacy voting tests at the 1903 National American Woman Suffrage Association convention in New Orleans.

Literary critic Susan S. Lanser says &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; should be interpreted by focusing on Gilman&#x27;s racism. Other literary critics have built on Lanser&#x27;s work to understand Gilman&#x27;s ideas in relation to turn-of-the-century culture more broadly.

=== Animals ===
Gilman&#x27;s feminist works often included stances and arguments for reforming the use of domesticated animals. In &quot;Herland&quot;, Gilman&#x27;s utopian society excludes all domesticated animals, including livestock. In &quot;Moving the Mountain&quot; Gilman addresses the ills of animal domestication related to inbreeding. In &quot;When I Was a Witch&quot;, the narrator witnesses and intervenes in instances of animal use as she travels through New York, liberating work horses, cats, and lapdogs by rendering them &quot;comfortably dead&quot;. One literary scholar connected the regression of the female narrator in &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; to the parallel status of domesticated felines. She wrote in a letter to the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; that the automobile would eliminate the cruelty to horses used to pull carriages and cars.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; was initially met with a mixed reception. One anonymous letter submitted to the &quot;Boston Transcript&quot; read, &quot;The story could hardly, it would seem, give pleasure to any reader, and to many whose lives have been touched through the dearest ties by this dread disease, it must bring the keenest pain. To others, whose lives have become a struggle against heredity of mental derangement, such literature contains deadly peril. Should such stories be allowed to pass without severest censure?&quot;

Positive reviewers describe it as impressive because it is the most suggestive and graphic account of why women who live monotonous lives are susceptible to mental illness.

Although Gilman had gained international fame with the publication of &quot;Women and Economics&quot; in 1898, by the end of World War I, she seemed out of tune with her times. In her autobiography she admitted that &quot;unfortunately my views on the sex question do not appeal to the Freudian complex of today, nor are people satisfied with a presentation of religion as a help in our tremendous work of improving this world.&quot;

Lane writes in &quot;Herland and Beyond&quot; that &quot;Gilman offered perspectives on major issues of gender with which we still grapple; the origins of women&#x27;s subjugation, the struggle to achieve both autonomy and intimacy in human relationships; the central role of work as a definition of self; new strategies for rearing and educating future generations to create a humane and nurturing environment.&quot;

<text>Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court that held the U.S. Constitution did not extend American citizenship to people of black African descent, and therefore they could not enjoy the rights and privileges the Constitution conferred upon American citizens. The decision is widely considered the worst in the Supreme Court&#x27;s history, being widely denounced for its overt racism, judicial activism, poor legal reasoning, and crucial role in the events that led to the American Civil War four years later. Legal scholar Bernard Schwartz said that it &quot;stands first in any list of the worst Supreme Court decisions.&quot; A future chief justice, Charles Evans Hughes, called it the Court&#x27;s &quot;greatest self-inflicted wound&quot;.

The decision involved the case of Dred Scott, an enslaved black man whose owners had taken him from Missouri, a slave-holding state, into Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory, where slavery was illegal. When his owners later brought him back to Missouri, Scott sued for his freedom and claimed that because he had been taken into &quot;free&quot; U.S. territory, he had automatically been freed and was legally no longer a slave. Scott sued first in Missouri state court, which ruled that he was still a slave under its law. He then sued in U.S. federal court, which ruled against him by deciding that it had to apply Missouri law to the case. He then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision against Scott. In an opinion written by Chief Justice Roger Taney, the Court ruled that people of African descent &quot;are not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word &#x27;citizens&#x27; in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States&quot;; more specifically, that African Americans were not entitled to &quot;full liberty of speech... to hold public meetings... and to keep and carry arms&quot; along with other constitutionally protected rights and privileges. Taney supported his ruling with an extended survey of American state and local laws from the time of the Constitution&#x27;s drafting in 1787 that purported to show that a &quot;perpetual and impassable barrier was intended to be erected between the white race and the one which they had reduced to slavery.&quot; Because the Court ruled that Scott was not an American citizen, he was also not a citizen of any state and, accordingly, could never establish the &quot;diversity of citizenship&quot; that Article III of the U.S. Constitution requires for a U.S. federal court to be able to exercise jurisdiction over a case. After ruling on those issues surrounding Scott, Taney struck down the Missouri Compromise because, by prohibiting slavery in U.S. territories north of the 36°30′ parallel, it interfered with slave owners&#x27; property rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Although Taney and several other justices hoped the decision would settle the slavery controversy, which was increasingly dividing the American public, the decision only exacerbated interstate tension. Taney&#x27;s majority opinion suited the slaveholding states, but was intensely decried in all the other states. The decision inflamed the national debate over slavery and deepened the divide that led ultimately to the American Civil War. In 1865, after the Union&#x27;s victory, the Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Dred Scott&quot; was superseded by the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery, and the Fourteenth Amendment, whose first section guaranteed citizenship for &quot;[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.&quot; 

Historians agree that the Court decision was a major disaster for the nation as it dramatically inflamed tensions leading to the Civil War. The ruling is widely considered a blatant act of judicial activism with the intent of bringing finality to the territorial crisis resulting from the Louisiana Purchase by creating a constitutional right to own slaves anywhere in the country while permanently disenfranchising all people of African descent. The court&#x27;s decision to overturn the Missouri Compromise, which had already been replaced with the Kansas–Nebraska Act and thus was a legally moot issue, is cited as proof of this because the latter act was determined by the due process of popular sovereignty, and thus could not be overturned the same way as the Missouri Compromise. During the United States election of 1860, Republicans rejected the ruling as being corrupted by partisanship and non-binding because the court had no jurisdiction. Their presidential nominee, Abraham Lincoln, stated he would not permit slavery anywhere in the country except where it already existed, which directly contradicted the court&#x27;s ruling. His election is considered the final event that led the Southern states to secede from the Union, igniting the American Civil War.

==Background==
===Political setting===
In the late 1810s, a major political dispute arose over the creation of new U.S. states from the vast territory the United States had acquired from France in 1803 by the Louisiana Purchase. The dispute centered on whether the new states would be &quot;free&quot; states in which slavery would be illegal, as in the Northern states, or whether they would be &quot;slave&quot; states in which slavery would be legal, as in the Southern states. The Southern states wanted the new states to be slave states in order to enhance their own political and economic power. The Northern states wanted the new states to be free states for their own political and economic reasons, as well as their moral concerns over allowing the institution of slavery to expand.

In 1820, the U.S. Congress passed legislation known as the &quot;Missouri Compromise&quot; that was intended to resolve the dispute. The Compromise first admitted Maine into the Union as a free state, then created Missouri out of a portion of the Louisiana Purchase territory and admitted it as a slave state; at the same time, it prohibited slavery in the area north of the parallel 36°30′ north, where most of the territory lay. The legal effects of a slaveowner taking his slaves from Missouri into the free territory north of the 36°30′ north parallel, as well as the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise itself, eventually came to a head in the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; case.

===Dred Scott and John Emerson===
Dred Scott was born a slave in Virginia around 1799. Little is known of his early years. His owner, Peter Blow, moved to Alabama in 1818, taking his six slaves along to work a farm near Huntsville. In 1830, Blow gave up farming and settled in St. Louis, Missouri, where he sold Scott to U.S. Army surgeon Dr. John Emerson. After purchasing Scott, Emerson took him to Fort Armstrong in Illinois. A free state, Illinois had been free as a territory under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and had prohibited slavery in its constitution in 1819 when it was admitted as a state.

In 1836, Emerson moved with Scott from Illinois to Fort Snelling in the Wisconsin territory in what has become the state of Minnesota. Slavery in the Wisconsin Territory (some of which, including Fort Snelling, was part of the Louisiana Purchase) was prohibited by the U.S. Congress under the Missouri Compromise. During his stay at Fort Snelling, Scott married Harriet Robinson in a civil ceremony by Harriet&#x27;s owner, Major Lawrence Taliaferro, a justice of the peace who was also an Indian agent. The ceremony would have been unnecessary had Dred Scott been a slave, as slave marriages had no recognition in the law.

In 1837, the army ordered Emerson to Jefferson Barracks Military Post, south of St. Louis. Emerson left Scott and his wife at Fort Snelling, where he leased their services out for profit. By hiring Scott out in a free state, Emerson was effectively bringing the institution of slavery into a free state, which was a direct violation of the Missouri Compromise, the Northwest Ordinance, and the Wisconsin Enabling Act.

==== Irene Sanford Emerson ====
Before the end of the year, the army reassigned Emerson to Fort Jesup in Louisiana, where Emerson married Eliza Irene Sanford in February 1838. Emerson sent for Scott and Harriet, who proceeded to Louisiana to serve their master and his wife. Within months, Emerson was transferred back to Fort Snelling. While en route to Fort Snelling, Scott&#x27;s daughter Eliza was born on a steamboat under way on the Mississippi River between Illinois and what would become Iowa. Because Eliza was born in free territory, she was technically born as a free person under both federal and state laws. Upon entering Louisiana, the Scotts could have sued for their freedom, but did not. One scholar suggests that, in all likelihood, the Scotts would have been granted their freedom by a Louisiana court, as it had respected laws of free states that slaveholders forfeited their right to slaves if they brought them in for extended periods. This had been the holding in Louisiana state courts for more than 20 years.

Toward the end of 1838, the army reassigned Emerson back to Fort Snelling. By 1840, Emerson&#x27;s wife Irene returned to St. Louis with their slaves, while Dr. Emerson served in the Seminole War. While in St. Louis, she hired them out. In 1842, Emerson left the army. After he died in the Iowa Territory in 1843, his widow Irene inherited his estate, including the Scotts. For three years after John Emerson&#x27;s death, she continued to lease out the Scotts as hired slaves. In 1846, Scott attempted to purchase his and his family&#x27;s freedom, but Irene Emerson refused, prompting Scott to resort to legal recourse.

==Procedural history==
=== &quot;Scott v. Emerson&quot; ===

==== First state circuit court trial ====
Having been unsuccessful in his attempt to purchase his freedom, Dred Scott, with the help of his legal advisers, sued Emerson for his freedom in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County on April 6, 1846. A separate petition was filed for his wife Harriet, making them the first married couple to file freedom suits in tandem in its 50-year history. They received financial assistance from the family of Dred&#x27;s previous owner, Peter Blow. Blow&#x27;s daughter Charlotte was married to Joseph Charless, an officer at the Bank of Missouri. Charless signed legal documents as security for the Scotts and later secured the services of the bank&#x27;s attorney, Samuel Mansfield Bay, for the trial.

It was expected that the Scotts would win their freedom with relative ease. By 1846, dozens of freedom suits had been won in Missouri by former slaves. Most had claimed their legal right to freedom on the basis that they, or their mothers, had previously lived in free states or territories. Among the most important legal precedents were &quot;Winny v. Whitesides&quot; and &quot;Rachel v. Walker.&quot; In &quot;Winny v. Whitesides&quot;, the Missouri Supreme Court had ruled in 1824 that a person who had been held as a slave in Illinois, where slavery was illegal, and then brought to Missouri, was free by virtue of residence in a free state. In &quot;Rachel v. Walker&quot;, the state supreme court had ruled that a U.S. Army officer who took a slave to a military post in a territory where slavery was prohibited and retained her there for several years, had thereby &quot;forfeit[ed] his property&quot;. Rachel, like Dred Scott, had accompanied her enslaver to Fort Snelling.

Scott was represented by three different lawyers from the filing of the original petition to the time of the actual trial, over one year later. The first was Francis B. Murdoch, a prolific freedom suit attorney who abruptly left St. Louis. Murdoch was replaced by Charles D. Drake, an in-law of the Blow family. When Drake also left the state, Samuel M. Bay took over as the Scotts&#x27; lawyer. Irene Emerson was represented by George W. Goode, a proslavery lawyer from Virginia. By the time the case went to trial, it had been reassigned from Judge John M. Krum, who was proslavery, to Judge Alexander Hamilton, who was known to be sympathetic to freedom suits.

&quot;Dred Scott v. Irene Emerson&quot; finally went to trial for the first time on June 30, 1847. Henry Peter Blow testified in court that his father had owned Dred and sold him to John Emerson. The fact that Scott had been taken to live on free soil was clearly established through depositions from witnesses who had known Scott and Dr. Emerson at Fort Armstrong and Fort Snelling. Grocer Samuel Russell testified that he had hired the Scotts from Irene Emerson and paid her father, Alexander Sanford, for their services. Upon cross examination, however, Russell admitted that the leasing arrangements had actually been made by his wife, Adeline.

Thus, Russell&#x27;s testimony was ruled hearsay, and the jury returned a verdict for Emerson. This created a seemingly contradictory outcome in which Scott was ordered by the court to remain Irene Emerson&#x27;s slave, because he had been unable to prove that he was previously Irene Emerson&#x27;s slave.

==== First state supreme court appeal ====
Bay moved immediately for a new trial on the basis that Scott&#x27;s case had been lost due to a technicality which could be rectified, rather than the facts. Judge Hamilton finally issued the order for a new trial on December 2, 1847. Two days later, Emerson&#x27;s lawyer objected to a new trial by filing a bill of exceptions. The case was then taken on writ of error to the Supreme Court of Missouri. Scott&#x27;s new lawyers, Alexander P. Field and David N. Hall, argued that the writ of error was inappropriate because the lower court had not yet issued a final judgment. The state supreme court agreed unanimously with their position and dismissed Emerson&#x27;s appeal on June 30, 1848. The main issue before the court at this stage was procedural and no substantive issues were discussed.

==== Second state circuit court trial ====
Before the state supreme court had convened, Goode had presented a motion on behalf of Emerson to have Scott taken into custody and hired out. On March 17, 1848, Judge Hamilton issued the order to the St. Louis County sheriff. Anyone hiring Scott had to post a bond of six-hundred dollars. Wages he earned during that time were placed in escrow, to be paid to the party that prevailed in the lawsuit. Scott would remain in the sheriff&#x27;s custody or hired out by him until March 18, 1857. One of Scott&#x27;s lawyers, David N. Hall, hired him starting March 17, 1849.

The St. Louis Fire of 1849, a cholera epidemic, and two continuances delayed the retrial in the St. Louis Circuit Court until January 12, 1850. Irene Emerson was now defended by Hugh A. Garland and Lyman D. Norris, while Scott was represented by Field and Hall. Judge Alexander Hamilton was presiding. The proceedings were similar to the first trial. The same depositions from Catherine A. Anderson and Miles H. Clark were used to establish that Dr. Emerson had taken Scott to free territory.

This time, the hearsay problem was surmounted by a deposition from Adeline Russell stating that she had hired the Scotts from Irene Emerson, thereby proving that Emerson claimed them as her slaves. Samuel Russell testified in court once again that he had paid for their services. The defense then changed strategy and argued in their summation that Mrs. Emerson had every right to hire out Dred Scott, because he had lived with Dr. Emerson at Fort Armstrong and Fort Snelling under military jurisdiction, not under civil law. In doing so, the defense ignored the precedent set by &quot;Rachel v. Walker.&quot; In his rebuttal, Hall stated that the fact that they were military posts did not matter, and pointed out that Dr. Emerson had left Scott behind at Fort Snelling, hired out to others, after being reassigned to a new post.

The jury quickly returned a verdict in favor of Dred Scott, nominally making him a free man. Judge Hamilton declared Harriet, Eliza and Lizzie Scott to be free as well. Garland moved immediately for a new trial, and was overruled. On February 13, 1850, Emerson&#x27;s defense filed a bill of exceptions, which was certified by Judge Hamilton, setting into motion another appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court. Counsel for the opposing sides signed an agreement that moving forward, only &quot;Dred Scott v. Irene Emerson&quot; would be advanced, and that any decision made by the high court would apply to Harriet&#x27;s suit, also. In 1849 or 1850, Irene Emerson left St. Louis and moved to Springfield, Massachusetts. Her brother, John F. A. Sanford, continued looking after her business interests when she left, and her departure had no impact on the case.

==== Second state supreme court appeal ====
Both parties filed briefs with the Supreme Court of Missouri on March 8, 1850. A busy docket delayed consideration of the case until the October term. By then, the issue of slavery had become politically charged, even within the judiciary. Although the Missouri Supreme Court had not yet overturned precedent in freedom suits, in the 1840s, the court&#x27;s proslavery justices had explicitly stated their opposition to freeing slaves. After the court convened on October 25, 1850, the two justices who were proslavery anti-Benton Democrats – William Barclay Napton and James Harvey Birch – persuaded John Ferguson Ryland, a Benton Democrat, to join them in a unanimous decision that Dred Scott remained a slave under Missouri law. However, Judge Napton delayed writing the court&#x27;s opinion for months. Then in August 1851, both Napton and Birch lost their seats in the Missouri Supreme Court, following the state&#x27;s first supreme court election, with only Ryland remaining as an incumbent. The case thus needed to be considered again by the newly elected court. The reorganized Missouri Supreme Court now included two moderates – Hamilton Gamble and John Ryland – and one staunch proslavery justice, William Scott.

David N. Hall had prepared the brief for Dred Scott but died in March 1851. Alexander P. Field continued alone as counsel for Dred Scott, and resubmitted the same briefs from 1850 for both sides. On November 29, 1851, the case was taken under consideration, on written briefs alone, and a decision was reached. However, before Judge Scott could write the court&#x27;s opinion, Lyman Norris, co-counsel for Irene Emerson, obtained permission to submit a new brief he had been preparing, to replace the original one submitted by Garland.

Norris&#x27;s brief has been characterized as &quot;a sweeping denunciation of the authority of both the [Northwest] Ordinance of 1787 and the Missouri Compromise.&quot; Although he stopped short of questioning their constitutionality, Norris questioned their applicability and criticized the early Missouri Supreme Court, ridiculing former Justice George Tompkins as &quot;the great apostle of freedom at that day.&quot; 

Reviewing the court&#x27;s past decisions on freedom suits, Norris acknowledged that if &quot;Rachel v. Walker&quot; was allowed to stand, his client would lose. Norris then challenged the concept of &quot;once free, always free&quot;, and asserted that the court under Tompkins had been wrong to rule that the Ordinance of 1787 remained in force after the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788. Finally, he argued that the Missouri Compromise should be disregarded whenever it interfered with Missouri law, and that the laws of other states should not be enforced, if their enforcement would cause Missouri citizens to lose their property. In support of his argument, he cited Chief Justice Roger B. Taney&#x27;s opinion in the United States Supreme Court case &quot;Strader v. Graham&quot;, which argued that the status of a slave returning from a free state must be determined by the slave state itself. According to historian Walter Ehrlich, the closing of Norris&#x27;s brief was &quot;a racist harangue that not only revealed the prejudices of its author, but also indicated how the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; case had become a vehicle for the expression of such views&quot;. Noting that Norris&#x27;s proslavery &quot;doctrines&quot; were later incorporated into the court&#x27;s final decision, Ehrlich writes (emphasis his):&quot;From this point on, the&quot; Dred Scott &quot;case clearly changed from a genuine freedom suit to the controversial political issue for which it became infamous in American history.&quot;On March 22, 1852, Judge William Scott announced the decision of the Missouri Supreme Court that Dred Scott remained a slave, and ordered the trial court&#x27;s judgment to be reversed. Judge Ryland concurred, while Chief Justice Hamilton Gamble dissented. The majority opinion written by Judge Scott focused on the issue of comity or conflict of laws, and relied on states&#x27; rights rhetoric:Every State has the right of determining how far, in a spirit of comity, it will respect the laws of other States. Those laws have no intrinsic right to be enforced beyond the limits of the State for which they were enacted. The respect allowed them will depend altogether on their conformity to the policy of our institutions. No State is bound to carry into effect enactments conceived in a spirit hostile to that which pervades her own laws.Judge Scott did not deny the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise and acknowledged that its prohibition of slavery was &quot;absolute&quot;, but only within the specified territory. Thus, a slave crossing the border could obtain his freedom, but only within the court of the free state. Rejecting the court&#x27;s own precedent, Scott argued that Once free&#x27; did not necessarily mean &#x27;always free. He cited the Kentucky Court of Appeals decision in &quot;Graham v. Strader&quot;, which had held that a Kentucky slaveowner who permitted a slave to go to Ohio temporarily, did not forfeit ownership of the slave. To justify overturning three decades of precedent, Judge Scott argued that circumstances had changed:Times now are not as they were when the former decisions on this subject were made. Since then not only individuals but States have been possessed with a dark and fell spirit in relation to slavery, whose gratification is sought in the pursuit of measures, whose inevitable consequence must be the overthrow and destruction of our government. Under such circumstances it does not behoove the State of Missouri to show the least countenance to any measure which might gratify this spirit. She is willing to assume her full responsibility for the existence of slavery within her limits, nor does she seek to share or divide it with others.On March 23, 1852, the day after the Missouri Supreme Court decision had been announced, Irene Emerson&#x27;s lawyers filed an order in the St. Louis Circuit Court for the bonds signed by the Blow family to cover the Scotts&#x27; court costs; return of the slaves themselves; and transfer of their wages earned over four years, plus 6 percent interest. On June 29, 1852, Judge Hamilton overruled the order.

===&quot;Scott v. Sanford&quot;=== 
The case looked hopeless, and the Blow family could no longer pay for Scott&#x27;s legal costs. Scott also lost both of his lawyers when Alexander Field moved to Louisiana and David Hall died. The case was undertaken &quot;pro bono&quot; by Roswell Field, who employed Scott as a janitor. Field also discussed the case with LaBeaume, who had taken over the lease on the Scotts in 1851. After the Missouri Supreme Court decision, Judge Hamilton turned down a request by Emerson&#x27;s lawyers to release the rent payments from escrow and to deliver the slaves into their owner&#x27;s custody.

In 1853, Dred Scott again sued his current owner John Sanford, but this time in federal court. Sanford returned to New York and the federal courts had diversity jurisdiction under Article III, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution. In addition to the existing complaints, Scott alleged that Sanford had assaulted his family and held them captive for six hours on January 1, 1853.

At trial in 1854, Judge Robert William Wells directed the jury to rely on Missouri law on the question of Scott&#x27;s freedom. Since the Missouri Supreme Court had held that Scott remained a slave, the jury found in favor of Sanford. Scott then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the clerk misspelled the defendant&#x27;s name, and the case was recorded as &quot;Dred Scott&quot; v. &quot;Sandford&quot;, with an ever-erroneous title. Scott was represented before the Supreme Court by Montgomery Blair and George Ticknor Curtis, whose brother Benjamin was a Supreme Court Justice. Sanford was represented by Reverdy Johnson and Henry S. Geyer.

===Sanford as defendant===
When the case was filed, the two sides agreed on a statement of facts that claimed Scott had been sold by Dr. Emerson to John Sanford, though this was a legal fiction. Dr. Emerson had died in 1843, and Dred Scott had filed his 1847 suit against Irene Emerson. There is no record of Dred Scott&#x27;s transfer to Sanford or of his transfer back to Irene. John Sanford died shortly before Scott&#x27;s manumission, and Scott was not listed in the probate records of Sanford&#x27;s estate. Also, Sanford was not acting as Dr. Emerson&#x27;s executor, as he was never appointed by a probate court, and the Emerson estate had been settled when the federal case was filed.

The murky circumstances of ownership led many to conclude the parties to &quot;Dred Scott&quot; v. &quot;Sandford&quot; contrived to create a test case. Mrs. Emerson&#x27;s remarriage to abolitionist U.S. Representative Calvin C. Chaffee seemed suspicious to contemporaries, and Sanford was thought to be a front and to have allowed himself to be sued, despite not actually being Scott&#x27;s owner. Nevertheless, Sanford had been involved in the case since 1847, before his sister married Chaffee. He had secured counsel for his sister in the state case, and he engaged the same lawyer for his own defense in the federal case. Sanford also consented to be represented by genuine pro-slavery advocates before the Supreme Court, rather than to put up a token defense.

===Influence of President Buchanan===
Historians discovered that after the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case but before it issued a ruling, President-elect James Buchanan wrote to his friend, Supreme Court Associate Justice John Catron, to ask whether the case would be decided by the Court before his inauguration in March 1857. Buchanan hoped that the decision would quell unrest in the country over the slavery issue by issuing a ruling to take it out of political debate. He later successfully pressured Associate Justice Robert Cooper Grier, a Northerner, to join the Southern majority in &quot;Dred Scott&quot; to prevent the appearance that the decision was made along sectional lines. According to historian Paul Finkelman: Buchanan already knew what the Court was going to decide. In a major breach of Court etiquette, Justice Grier, who, like Buchanan, was from Pennsylvania, had kept the President-elect fully informed about the progress of the case and the internal debates within the Court. When Buchanan urged the nation to support the decision, he already knew what Taney would say. Republican suspicions of impropriety turned out to be fully justified.

Biographer Jean H. Baker argues that Buchanan&#x27;s use of political pressure on a member of a sitting court was regarded then, as now, to be highly improper. Republicans fueled speculation as to Buchanan&#x27;s influence by publicizing that Taney had secretly informed Buchanan of the decision. Buchanan declared in his inaugural address that the slavery question would &quot;be speedily and finally settled&quot; by the Supreme Court.

==Supreme Court decision==
On March 6, 1857, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Dred Scott in a 7–2 decision that fills over 200 pages in the &quot;United States Reports&quot;. The decision contains opinions from all nine justices, but the &quot;majority opinion&quot; has always been the focus of the controversy.

===Opinion of the Court===

Seven justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by Chief Justice Roger Taney. Taney began the Court&#x27;s opinion with what he saw as the core issue in the case: whether black people could possess federal citizenship under the U.S. Constitution.

In answer, the Court ruled they could not. It held that black people could not be U.S. citizens, and therefore a lawsuit to which they were a party could never qualify for the &quot;diversity of citizenship&quot; that Article III of the Constitution requires for a federal court to have jurisdiction over a case that does not involve a question of federal law. 

The primary rationale for the Court&#x27;s ruling was Taney&#x27;s assertion that black African slaves and their descendants were never intended to be part of the American social and political community:

The Court then extensively reviewed laws from the original American states that involved the status of black Americans at the time of the Constitution&#x27;s drafting in 1787. It concluded that these laws showed that a &quot;perpetual and impassable barrier was intended to be erected between the white race and the one which they had reduced to slavery&quot;. The Court therefore ruled that black people were not American citizens and could not sue as citizens in federal courts. This meant that U.S. states lacked the power to alter the legal status of black people by granting them state citizenship:

This holding normally would have ended the decision, since it disposed of Dred Scott&#x27;s case by effectively declaring that Scott had no standing to bring suit, but Taney did not confine his ruling to the matter immediately before the Court. He went on to assess the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise itself, writing that the Compromise&#x27;s legal provisions intended to free slaves who were living north of the 36°N 30&#x27; latitude line in the western territories. In the Court&#x27;s judgment, this constituted the government depriving owners of slave property without due process of law, which is forbidden under the Fifth Amendment. Taney also reasoned that the Constitution and the Bill of Rights implicitly precluded any possibility of constitutional rights for black African slaves and their descendants. Thus, Taney concluded:

Taney held that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, marking the first time since the 1803 case &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; that the Supreme Court had struck down a federal law, although the Missouri Compromise had already been effectively overridden by the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Taney based this argument on a narrow interpretation of the Property Clause of Article 4, Section 3 of the Constitution: &quot;The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States...&quot; He ruled that the Property Clause &quot;applied only to the property which the States held in common at that time and has no reference whatever to any territory or other property which the new sovereignty might afterwards itself acquire.&quot; Because the Louisiana Territory was not part of the United States at the time of the Constitution&#x27;s ratification, Congress did not have the authority to ban slavery in the territory. Thus, the Missouri Compromise exceeded the scope of Congress powers and was unconstitutional, and hence Dred Scott was still a slave regardless of his residence in the purportedly free Northwest Territory, and he was still a slave under Missouri law, which had proper authority over the matter. For all these reasons, the Court concluded that Scott could not bring suit in U.S. federal court.

===Dissents===
Justices Benjamin Robbins Curtis and John McLean dissented from the Court&#x27;s decision, and they both authored dissenting opinions. 

Curtis&#x27; 67-page dissent argued that the Court&#x27;s conclusion that black people could not be U.S. citizens was legally and historically baseless. He pointed out that at the time of the Constitution&#x27;s adoption in 1789, black men could vote in five of the 13 states. Under the law, that made them citizens of both their individual states and of the United States. Curtis cited many state statutes and court decisions in support of his position. His dissent was &quot;extremely persuasive&quot;, and it prompted Taney to delay issuing the decision for several weeks while he added 18 pages of rebuttal to the majority opinion.

McLean&#x27;s dissent deemed the argument that black people could not be citizens &quot;more a matter of taste than of law&quot;. He attacked much of the Court&#x27;s decision as non-binding &quot;obiter dicta&quot;, arguing that once the court determined that it did not have jurisdiction to hear Scott&#x27;s case, it should have simply dismissed the action without passing judgment on the merits of Scott&#x27;s lawsuit.

Curtis and McLean both attacked the Court&#x27;s overturning of the Missouri Compromise. They noted that it was not necessary to decide the question, and that none of the authors of the Constitution had ever raised constitutional objections to the antislavery provisions of the Northwest Ordinance, or the subsequent acts that barred slavery north of 36°30&#x27; N, or the prohibition on importing slaves from overseas passed in 1808. Curtis said slavery was not listed in the constitution as a &quot;natural right&quot;, but rather was a creation of public law. Article IV, section 3 of the Constitution states, &quot;The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.&quot; No exception was made for slavery, which thus fell under the regulatory power of Congress.

==Reactions==
The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Dred Scott&quot; was &quot;greeted with unmitigated wrath from every segment of the United States except the slave holding states.&quot; The American political historian Robert G. McCloskey described:

Many Republicans, including Abraham Lincoln, who was rapidly becoming the leading Republican in Illinois and was elected President three years later, regarded the decision as part of a plot to expand and eventually impose the legalization of slavery throughout all of the states. Some southern extremists wanted all states to recognize slavery as a constitutional right. Lincoln rejected the court&#x27;s majority opinion that &quot;the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution,&quot; pointing out that the constitution did not ever refer to slaves as property, and in fact explicitly called them &quot;persons&quot;. 

Southern Democrats considered Republicans to be lawless rebels who were provoking disunion by their refusal to accept the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision as the law of the land. Many northern opponents of slavery offered a legal argument for refusing to acknowledge the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision on the Missouri Compromise. They argued, following Justice Curtis&#x27; dissenting opinion, that the Court&#x27;s determination that the federal courts had no jurisdiction to hear the case rendered the remainder of the decision a non-binding &quot;obiter dictum&quot;—an advisement rather than an authoritative interpretation of the law. Stephen Douglas attacked that position in the Lincoln-Douglas debates:

In a speech at Springfield, Illinois, Lincoln responded that the Republican Party was not seeking to defy the Supreme Court, but he hoped they could convince it to reverse its ruling:
Democrats had previously refused to accept the court&#x27;s interpretation of the U.S. Constitution as permanently binding. During the Andrew Jackson administration, Taney, then Attorney General, had written: 

Frederick Douglass, a prominent black abolitionist who considered the decision to be unconstitutional and Taney&#x27;s reasoning contrary to the Founding Fathers&#x27; vision, predicted that the decision would bring the conflict over slavery to a head:

According to Jefferson Davis, then U.S. Senator from Mississippi and later President of the Confederacy, the case merely &quot;presented the question whether Cuffee [a derogatory term for a black person] should be kept in his normal condition or not . . . [and] whether the Congress of the United States could decide what might or might not be property in a Territory–the case being that of an officer of the army sent into a Territory to perform his public duty, having taken with him his negro slave&quot;.

==Impact on the litigants==
Irene Emerson moved to Massachusetts in 1850 and married Calvin C. Chaffee, a doctor and abolitionist who was elected to Congress on the Know Nothing and Republican tickets. Following the Supreme Court ruling, pro-slavery newspapers attacked Chaffee as a hypocrite. Chaffee protested that Dred Scott belonged to his brother-in-law and that he had nothing to do with Scott&#x27;s enslavement. Nevertheless, as a means of freeing Scott, the Chaffees executed a deed transferring the Scott family to Henry Taylor Blow, the son of Scott&#x27;s former owner, who could appear in person before the Missouri court. Taylor Blow had also previously contributed to Scott&#x27;s legal fees during the case. 

Taylor Blow filed the manumission papers with Judge Hamilton on May 26, 1857. The emancipation of Dred Scott and his family was national news and was celebrated in northern cities. Scott worked as a porter in a hotel in St. Louis, where he was a minor celebrity. His wife took in laundry. Dred Scott died of tuberculosis on November 7, 1858. Harriet died on June 17, 1876.

==Aftermath==
===Economic===
Economist Charles Calomiris and historian Larry Schweikart discovered that uncertainty about whether the entire West would suddenly become slave territory or engulfed in guerilla conflict like
&quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; gripped the markets immediately. The east-west railroads became insolvent immediately (although north-south lines were unaffected), in turn causing dangerous runs on several large banks, events known as the Panic of 1857.

This financial panic, unlike that of 1837, almost exclusively impacted the North, which the historians attribute to the North&#x27;s system of unit banking, with many competing banks which hid financial information from each other, breeding uncertainty. In contrast, the South&#x27;s branch banking system allowed information to move reliably among the branch banks, and transmission of the panic was minor.

===Political===
Southerners, who had grown uncomfortable with the Kansas-Nebraska Act, argued that they had a constitutional right to bring slaves into the territories, regardless of any decision by a territorial legislature on the subject. The &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision seemed to endorse that view.

Although Taney believed that the decision represented a compromise that would be a final settlement of the slavery question by transforming a contested political issue into a matter of settled law, the decision produced the opposite result. It strengthened Northern opposition to slavery, divided the Democratic Party on sectional lines, encouraged secessionist elements among Southern supporters of slavery to make bolder demands, and strengthened the Republican Party.

In 1860, the Republican Party explicitly rejected the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; verdict in their official platform, stating &quot;the new dogma that the Constitution, of its own force, carries slavery into any or all of the territories of the United States, is a dangerous political heresy, at variance with the explicit provisions of that instrument itself, with contemporaneous exposition, and with legislative and judicial precedent; is revolutionary in its tendency, and subversive of the peace and harmony of the country.&quot;

==Later references==
In 1859, when defending two black men, John Anthony Copeland and Shields Green, from the charge of treason following their participation in John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry, their attorney George Sennott cited the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision in arguing successfully that since they were not citizens according to that Supreme Court ruling, they could not commit treason. Nevertheless, they were found guilty and executed on other charges.

In 1896, in the Jim Crow era, Justice John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenting vote in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896), which declared racial segregation constitutional and created the concept of &quot;separate but equal&quot;. In his dissent, Harlan wrote that the majority&#x27;s opinion would &quot;prove to be quite as pernicious as the decision made by this tribunal in the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; case&quot;.

Charles Evans Hughes, writing in 1927 on the Supreme Court&#x27;s history, described &quot;Dred Scott&quot; as a &quot;self-inflicted wound&quot; from which the court would not recover for many years.

In 1952, as a law clerk to Justice Robert H. Jackson, future Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote in a memo on &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;: &quot;&quot;Scott v. Sandford&quot; was the result of Taney&#x27;s effort to protect slaveholders from legislative interference.&quot;

Justice Antonin Scalia compared the rationale behind &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; (1992) to &quot;Dred Scott&quot; in an effort to undermine &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;:

&quot;Dred Scott&quot; ... rested upon the concept of &quot;substantive due process&quot; that the Court praises and employs today. Indeed, &quot;Dred Scott&quot; was very possibly the first application of substantive due process in the Supreme Court, the original precedent for... &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.
Scalia noted that &quot;Dred Scott&quot; had been written and championed by Taney and left the justice&#x27;s reputation irrevocably tarnished. Taney botched his attempt to settle the question of slavery, and instead &quot;inflamed the national debate over slavery and deepened the divide that led ultimately to the American Civil War&quot;. Justice Clarence Thomas similarly compared &quot;Dred Scott&quot; to &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in his concurring opinion in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, the decision overturning &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in 2022.

Chief Justice John Roberts compared &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2015) to &quot;Dred Scott&quot; as another example of trying to settle a contentious issue through a ruling that went beyond the scope of the Constitution.

* 2000: Harriet and Dred Scott&#x27;s petition papers in their freedom suit were displayed at the main branch of the St. Louis Public Library, following the discovery of more than 300 freedom suits in the archives of the U.S. circuit court.
* 2006: An historic plaque was erected at the Old Courthouse to honor the active roles of both Dred and Harriet Scott in their freedom suit and the case&#x27;s significance in U.S. history.
* 2012: A monument depicting Dred and Harriet Scott was erected at the Old Courthouse&#x27;s east entrance facing the St. Louis Gateway Arch.
* 2024: During the 2024 presidential campaign, the National Federation of Republican Assemblies cited &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; to claim that Vice President Kamala Harris is not a natural born U.S citizen and therefore is ineligible to run for president.

<text>Dred Scott ( – September 17, 1858) was an enslaved African American man who, along with his wife, Harriet, unsuccessfully sued for the freedom of themselves and their two daughters, Eliza and Lizzie, in the &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; case of 1857, popularly known as the &quot;Dred Scott decision&quot;. The Scotts claimed that they should be granted freedom because Dred had lived in Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory for four years, where slavery was illegal, and laws in those jurisdictions said that slave holders gave up their rights to slaves if they stayed for an extended period.

In a landmark case, the United States Supreme Court decided 7–2 against Scott, finding that neither he nor any other person of African ancestry could claim citizenship in the United States, and therefore Scott could not bring suit in federal court under diversity of citizenship rules. Scott&#x27;s temporary residence in free territory outside Missouri did not bring about his emancipation, because the Missouri Compromise, which made that territory free by prohibiting slavery north of the 36°30′ parallel, was unconstitutional because it &quot;deprives citizens of their [slave] property without due process of law&quot;.

Although Chief Justice Roger B. Taney had hoped to settle issues related to slavery and congressional authority by this decision, it aroused public outrage, deepened sectional tensions between the northern and southern states, and hastened the eventual explosion of their differences into the American Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and the post-Civil War Reconstruction Amendments—the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments—nullified the decision. The Scotts were manumitted by private arrangement in May 1857. Dred Scott died of tuberculosis a year later.

== Life ==

Dred Scott was born into slavery in Southampton County, Virginia. It is not clear whether Dred was his given name or a shortened form of Etheldred.

In 1818, Dred was taken by Peter Blow and his family, with their five other slaves, to Alabama, where the family ran an unsuccessful farm in a location near Huntsville. This site is now occupied by Oakwood University. The Blows gave up farming in 1830 and moved to St. Louis, Missouri.

Dred Scott was sold to Dr. John Emerson, a surgeon serving in the United States Army, who planned to move to Rock Island, Illinois. Blow died in 1832, and historians debate whether Scott was sold to Emerson before or after Blow&#x27;s death. Some believe that Scott was sold in 1831, while others point to a number of enslaved people in Blow&#x27;s estate who were sold to Emerson after Blow&#x27;s death, including one with a name given as Sam, who may be the same person as Scott. After Scott learned of this sale, he attempted to run away. His decision to do so was spurred by a distaste he had developed for Emerson. Scott was temporarily successful in his escape as he, much like many other runaway slaves during this time period, &quot;never tried to distance his pursuers, but dodged around among his fellow slaves as long as possible&quot;. Eventually, he was captured in the &quot;Lucas Swamps&quot; of Missouri and taken back.

As an army officer, Emerson moved frequently, taking Scott with him to each new army posting. In 1833, Emerson and Scott went to Fort Armstrong, in the free state of Illinois. In 1837, Emerson took Scott to Fort Snelling, in what is now the state of Minnesota and was then in the free territory of Wisconsin. There, Scott met and married Harriet Robinson, a slave owned by Lawrence Taliaferro. The marriage was formalized in a civil ceremony presided over by Taliaferro, who was a justice of the peace. Since slave marriages had no legal sanction, supporters of Scott later noted that this ceremony was evidence that Scott was being treated as a free man. But Taliaferro transferred ownership of Harriet to Emerson, who treated the Scotts as his slaves.

Dr. Emerson was transferred to Fort Jesup in Louisiana in 1837, leaving the Scott family behind at Fort Snelling and leasing them out (also called hiring out) to other officers. In February 1838, Emerson met and married Eliza Irene Sanford in Louisiana, whereupon he sent for the Scotts to join him, only to be reassigned to Fort Snelling later that year. While on a steamboat heading north on the Mississippi River, north of Missouri, Harriet Scott gave birth to their first child, whom they named Eliza. They later had a daughter, Lizzie. They also had two sons, but neither survived past infancy.

The Emersons and Scotts returned to Missouri, a slave state, in 1840. In 1842, Emerson left the Army. After he died in the Iowa Territory in 1843, his widow Irene inherited his estate, including the Scotts. For three years after Emerson&#x27;s death, she continued to lease out the Scotts as hired slaves. In 1846, Scott attempted to purchase his and his family&#x27;s freedom, offering $300 ($ adjusted for inflation). Irene Emerson refused the offer. Scott and his wife separately filed freedom suits to try to gain their freedom and that of their daughters. The cases were later combined by the courts.

==&quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;==
=== Summary ===

The Scotts&#x27; cases were first heard by the Missouri circuit court. The first court upheld the precedent of &quot;once free, always free&quot;. That is, because the Scotts had been held voluntarily for an extended period by their owner in a free territory, which provided for slaves to be freed under such conditions, the court ruled, they had gained their freedom. The owner appealed. In 1852 the Missouri supreme court overruled this decision, on the basis that the state did not have to abide by free states&#x27; laws, especially given the anti-slavery fervor of the time. It said that Scott should have filed for freedom in the Wisconsin Territory.

Scott ended up filing a freedom suit in federal court (see below for details), in a case that he appealed to the US Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that African descendants were not U.S. citizens and had no standing to sue for freedom. It also ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional. This was the last in a series of freedom suits from 1846 to 1857, that began in Missouri courts, and were heard by lower federal district courts. The US Supreme Court overturned the earlier precedents and established new limitations on African Americans.

=== In detail ===
In 1846, having failed to purchase his freedom, Scott filed a freedom suit in St. Louis Circuit Court. Missouri precedent, dating to 1824, had held that slaves freed through prolonged residence in a free state or territory, where the law provided for slaves to gain freedom under such conditions, would remain free if returned to Missouri. The doctrine was known as &quot;Once free, always free&quot;. Scott and his wife had resided for two years in free states and free territories, and his eldest daughter had been born on the Mississippi River, between a free state and a free territory.

Dred Scott was listed as the only plaintiff in the case, but his wife, Harriet, had filed separately and their cases were combined. She played a critical role, pushing him to pursue freedom on behalf of their family. She was a frequent churchgoer, and in St. Louis, her church pastor (a well-known abolitionist) connected the Scotts to their first lawyer. The Scott children were around the age of ten when the case was originally filed. The Scotts were worried that their daughters might be sold.

The &quot;Scott v. Emerson&quot; case was tried by the state in 1847 in the federal-state courthouse in St. Louis. Scott&#x27;s lawyer was originally Francis B. Murdoch and later Charles D. Drake. As more than a year elapsed from the time of the initial petition filing until the trial, Drake had moved away from St. Louis during that time. Samuel M. Bay tried the case in court. The verdict went against Scott, as testimony that established his ownership by Mrs. Emerson was ruled to be hearsay. But the judge called for a retrial, which was not held until January 1850. This time, direct evidence was introduced that Emerson owned Scott, and the jury ruled in favor of Scott&#x27;s freedom.

Irene Emerson appealed the verdict. In 1852, the Missouri Supreme Court struck down the lower court ruling, arguing that, because of the free states&#x27; anti-slavery fervor was encroaching on Missouri, the state no longer had to defer to the laws of free states. By this decision, the court overturned 28 years of precedent in Missouri. Justice Hamilton R. Gamble, who was later appointed as governor of Missouri, sharply disagreed with the majority decision and wrote a dissenting opinion.

In 1853, Scott again sued for his freedom, this time under federal law. Irene Emerson had moved to Massachusetts, and Scott had been transferred to Irene Emerson&#x27;s brother, John F. A. Sanford. Because Sanford was a citizen of New York, while Scott would be a citizen of Missouri if he were free, the Federal courts had diversity jurisdiction over the case. After losing again in federal district court, the Scotts appealed to the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;. (The name is spelled &quot;Sandford&quot; in the court decision due to a clerical error.)

On March 6, 1857, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney delivered the majority opinion. Taney ruled, with three major issues, that:

# Any person descended from Africans, whether slave or free, is not a citizen of the United States, according to the U.S. Constitution.
# The Ordinance of 1787 could not confer either freedom or citizenship within the Northwest Territory to non-white individuals.
# The provisions of the Act of 1820, known as the Missouri Compromise, were voided as a legislative act, since the act exceeded the powers of Congress, insofar as it attempted to exclude slavery and impart freedom and citizenship to non-white persons in the northern part of the Louisiana Purchase.

The Court had ruled that African Americans had no claim to freedom or citizenship. Since they were not citizens, they did not possess the legal standing to bring suit in a federal court. As slaves were private property, Congress did not have the power to regulate slavery in the territories and could not revoke a slave owner&#x27;s rights based on where he lived. This decision nullified the essence of the Missouri Compromise, which divided territories into jurisdictions either free or slave. Speaking for the majority, Taney ruled that because Scott was considered the private property of his owners, he was subject to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, prohibiting the taking of property from its owner &quot;without due process&quot;.

Rather than settling issues, as Taney had hoped, the court&#x27;s ruling in the Scott case increased tensions between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions in both North and South, further pushing the country toward the brink of civil war. Ultimately after the Civil War, on July 9, 1868, the 14th Amendment to the Constitution settled the issue of Black citizenship via Section 1 of that Amendment: &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside ...&quot;

==Abolitionist aid to Scott&#x27;s case==

Scott&#x27;s freedom suit before the state courts was backed financially by Peter Blow&#x27;s adult children, who had turned against slavery in the decade since they sold Dred Scott. Henry Taylor Blow was elected as a Republican Congressman after the Civil War, Charlotte Taylor Blow married the son of an abolitionist newspaper editor, and Martha Ella Blow married Charles D. Drake, one of Scott&#x27;s lawyers who was elected by the state legislature as a Republican US Senator. Members of the Blow family signed as security for Scott&#x27;s legal fees and secured the services of local lawyers. While the case was pending, the St. Louis County sheriff held these payments in escrow and leased Scott out for fees.

In 1851, Scott was leased by Charles Edmund LaBeaume, whose sister had married into the Blow family. Scott worked as a janitor at LaBeaume&#x27;s law office, which was shared with lawyer Roswell Field.

After the Missouri Supreme Court decision ruled against the Scotts, the Blow family concluded that the case was hopeless and decided that they could no longer pay Scott&#x27;s legal fees. Roswell Field agreed to represent Scott &quot;pro bono&quot; before the federal courts. Scott was represented before the U.S. Supreme Court by Montgomery Blair. (Blair later served in President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet as Postmaster General.) Assisting Blair was attorney George Curtis. His brother Benjamin was an Associate Supreme Court Justice and wrote one of the two dissents in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;.

In 1850, Irene Emerson remarried and moved to Springfield, Massachusetts. Her new husband, Calvin C. Chaffee, was an abolitionist. He was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1854 and fiercely attacked by pro-slavery newspapers for his apparent hypocrisy in owning slaves.

Given the complicated facts of the Dred Scott case, some observers on both sides raised suspicions of collusion to create a test case. Abolitionist newspapers charged that slaveholders colluded to name a New Yorker as defendant, while pro-slavery newspapers charged collusion on the abolitionist side.

About a century later, a historian established that John Sanford never legally owned Dred Scott, nor did he serve as executor of Dr. Emerson&#x27;s will. It was unnecessary to find a New Yorker to secure diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts, as Irene Emerson Chaffee (still legally the owner) had become a resident of Massachusetts. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Roswell Field advised Dr. Chaffee that Mrs. Chaffee had full powers over Scott. However, Sanford had been involved in the case since the beginning, as he had secured a lawyer to defend Mrs. Emerson in the original state lawsuit before she married Chaffee.

==Freedom==
Following the ruling, the Chaffees deeded the Scott family to Republican Congressman Taylor Blow, who manumitted them on May 26, 1857. Scott worked as a porter in a St. Louis hotel, but his freedom was short-lived; he died from tuberculosis in September 1858. He was survived by his wife and his two daughters.

Scott was originally interred in Wesleyan Cemetery in St. Louis. When this cemetery was closed nine years later, Taylor Blow transferred Scott&#x27;s coffin to an unmarked plot in the nearby Catholic Calvary Cemetery, St. Louis, which permitted burial of non-Catholic slaves by Catholic owners. Some of Scott&#x27;s family members have claimed that he was a Catholic. A local tradition later developed of placing Lincoln pennies on top of Scott&#x27;s gravestone for good luck.

Harriet Scott was buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Hillsdale, Missouri. She outlived her husband by 18 years, dying on June 17, 1876. Their daughter, Eliza, married and had two sons. Their other daughter, Lizzie, never married but, following Eliza&#x27;s early death, helped raise Eliza&#x27;s sons (Lizzie&#x27;s nephews). One of Eliza&#x27;s sons died young, but the other married and has descendants, some of whom still live in St. Louis as of 2023, including Lynne M. Jackson, Scott&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter, who led the successful effort to install a new towering memorial at Dred Scott&#x27;s grave at Calvary Cemetery on September 30, 2023. 

==Prelude to Emancipation Proclamation==
The newspaper coverage of the court ruling, and the 10-year legal battle raised awareness of slavery in non-slave states. The arguments for freedom were later used by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. The words of the decision built popular opinion and voter sentiment for his Emancipation Proclamation and the three constitutional amendments ratified shortly after the Civil War: The Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, abolishing slavery, granting former slaves&#x27; citizenship, and conferring citizenship to anyone born in the United States and &quot;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot; (excluding subjects to a foreign power such as children of foreign ambassadors).

<doc id="105823" wikidata="Q2065434" url="?curid=105823" title="Bush v. Gore">
<text>Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court on December 12, 2000, that settled a recount dispute in Florida&#x27;s 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. On December 8, the Florida Supreme Court had ordered a statewide recount of all undervotes, over 61,000 ballots that the vote tabulation machines had missed. The Bush campaign immediately asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the decision and halt the recount. Justice Antonin Scalia, contending that all the manual recounts being performed in Florida&#x27;s counties were illegitimate, urged his colleagues to grant the stay immediately. On December 9, the five conservative justices on the Court granted the stay, with Scalia citing &quot;irreparable harm&quot; that could befall Bush, as the recounts would cast &quot;a needless and unjustified cloud&quot; over Bush&#x27;s legitimacy. In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that &quot;counting every legally cast vote cannot constitute irreparable harm.&quot; Oral arguments were scheduled for December 11.

In a 5–4 &quot;per curiam&quot; decision, the Court ruled, strictly on equal protection grounds, that the recount be stopped. Specifically, it held that the use of different standards of counting in different counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution; the case had also been argued on Article II jurisdictional grounds, which found favor with only Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and William Rehnquist. The Court then ruled as to a remedy, deciding against the one, proposed by Justices Stephen Breyer and David Souter, of sending the case back to Florida to complete the recount using a uniform statewide standard before the scheduled December 18 meeting of Florida&#x27;s electors in Tallahassee. Instead, the majority held that no alternative method could be established within the discretionary December 12 &quot;safe harbor&quot; deadline set by Title 3 of the United States Code (3 U.S.C.), , which the Florida Supreme Court had stated that the Florida Legislature intended to meet. The Court, holding that not meeting the &quot;safe harbor&quot; deadline would violate the Florida Election Code, rejected an extension of the deadline to allow the Florida court to finish counting disputed ballots under uniform guidelines requested in a remedy proposed by Breyer and Souter. That deadline arrived two hours after the release of the Court&#x27;s decision. 

The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; was among the most controversial in U.S. history, as it allowed Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris&#x27;s vote certification to stand, giving Bush Florida&#x27;s 25 electoral votes. Florida&#x27;s votes gave Bush, the Republican nominee, 271 electoral votes, one more than the 270 required to win the Electoral College. This meant the defeat of Democratic candidate Al Gore, who received 266 electoral votes. Media organizations later analyzed the ballots and found that, under specified criteria, the original limited recount of undervotes in several large counties would have resulted in a Bush victory, but according to the Florida Ballot Project, a statewide recount would have shown that Gore received the most votes. Florida later retired the punch-card voting machines that produced the ballots disputed in the case.

==Background==

In the United States, each state conducts its own popular vote election for president and vice president. The voters are actually voting for a slate of electors, each of whom pledges to vote for a particular candidate for each office in the Electoral College. Article II, § 1, cl. 2 of the U.S. Constitution provides that each state legislature decides how electors are chosen. Referring to an earlier Supreme Court case, &quot;McPherson v. Blacker&quot;, the Court noted that early in U.S. history, most state legislatures directly appointed their slates of electors.

In the 21st century, state legislatures have enacted laws to provide for the selection of electors by popular vote within each state. While these laws vary, most states, including Florida, award all electoral votes to the candidate for either office who receives a plurality of the state&#x27;s popular vote. Any candidate who receives an absolute majority of all electoral votes nationally (270 since 1963) wins the presidential or vice-presidential election.

On November 8, 2000, the Florida Division of Elections reported that Bush won with 48.8% of the vote in Florida, a margin of victory of 1,784 votes. The margin of victory was less than 0.5% of the votes cast, so a statutorily mandated automatic machine recount occurred. On November 10, with the machine recount apparently finished in all but one county, Bush&#x27;s margin of victory had decreased to 327 votes.

According to legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, later analysis showed that 18 counties—accounting for a quarter of all votes cast in Florida—did not carry out the legally mandated machine recount, but &quot;No one from the Gore campaign ever challenged this view&quot; that the machine recount had been completed. Florida&#x27;s election laws allow a candidate to request a county to conduct a manual recount, and Gore requested manual recounts in four Florida counties—Volusia, Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade—that generally vote Democratic and would be expected to find more votes for Gore. Gore did not request any recounts in counties that generally vote Republican. The four counties granted the request and began manual recounts. Florida law also required all counties to certify their election returns to the Florida secretary of state within seven days of the election, and several of the counties conducting manual recounts did not believe they could meet this deadline.

On November 14, the statutory deadline, the Florida Circuit Court ruled that the seven-day deadline was mandatory but that the counties could amend their returns at a later date. The court also ruled that the secretary of state, after &quot;considering all attendant facts and circumstances&quot;, had discretion to include any late amended returns in the statewide certification. Before the 5 p.m. deadline on November 14, Volusia County completed its manual recount and certified its results. At 5 p.m. on November 14, Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris announced that she had received the certified returns from all 67 counties, while Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties were still conducting manual recounts.

Harris issued a set of criteria by which she would determine whether to allow late filings, and she required any county seeking to make a late filing to submit to her, by 2 p.m. the following day, a written statement of the facts and circumstances justifying the late filing. Four counties, including the three that missed the deadline, submitted statements, and after reviewing the submissions, Harris determined that none justified an extension of the deadline. She further announced that after she received the certified returns of the overseas absentee ballots from each county, she would certify the results of the presidential election on November 18. On November 17, the Florida Supreme Court enjoined Harris from certifying the election while it heard appeals from the various cases in progress. On November 21, it allowed continuation of the manual recounts and delayed certification until November 26.

==Stay of the Florida recount==
By December 8, 2000, there had been multiple court decisions about the presidential election in Florida. On that date, the Florida Supreme Court, by a 4–3 vote, ordered a statewide manual recount of undervotes. On December 9, ruling in response to an emergency request from Bush, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the recount. The Court also treated Bush&#x27;s application for relief as a petition for a writ of &quot;certiorari&quot;, , requested briefing from the parties by 4 p.m. on December 10, and scheduled oral argument for the morning of December 11.

Although opinions are rarely issued in connection with grants of certiorari (a minimum of four of the nine justices must vote in favor of the grant), Scalia filed an opinion concurring in the Court&#x27;s decision, writing that &quot;a brief response is necessary to [Stevens&#x27;s] dissent&quot;. According to Scalia,


Stevens&#x27;s dissenting opinion was joined by Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer. According to Stevens,

A number of legal scholars have agreed with the dissenters&#x27; argument that Bush failed to carry the &quot;heavy burden&quot; of demonstrating a &quot;likelihood of irreparable harm&quot;.

==Rapid developments==
The oral argument in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; occurred on December 11. Theodore Olson, a Washington, D.C., lawyer, delivered Bush&#x27;s oral argument. Katherine Harris was represented by Joseph Klock, a Florida-based attorney. New York lawyer David Boies argued for Gore. During the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s brief deliberation on &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, the Florida Supreme Court provided clarifications of its November 21 decision in &quot;Palm Beach County Canvassing Board v. Harris (Harris I)&quot;, which the U.S. Supreme Court had requested on December 4 after arguments in the case of &quot;Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board&quot;. Because of the case&#x27;s extraordinary nature and urgency, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; on December 12, a day after hearing oral argument.

==Relevant law==

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the U.S. Constitutional provision on which the decision in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; was based. Article II, § 1, cl. 2 of the Constitution specifies the number of electors per state, and, most relevant to this case, the manner in which those electors are selected, stipulating:

This clause arguably gives power to only one branch of Florida&#x27;s state government: the state legislature.

Section 2 of the Electoral Count Act, now codified in , regulates the &quot;determination of controversy as to appointment of electors&quot; in presidential elections. Of particular relevance to this case was the so-called &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision, which assures Congress&#x27;s deference to states in their appointments of electors if done by a specified deadline:

Since the electors were set to meet December 18, the discretional &quot;safe harbor&quot; deadline was December 12, just one day after the Court heard oral arguments in this case. According to :

==Issues considered by the Court==

The Court had to resolve two different questions to fully resolve the case:
*Were the recounts, as they were being conducted, constitutional?
*If the recounts were unconstitutional, what was the appropriate remedy?

Three days earlier, the five-Justice majority had ordered the recount stopped, and the Court had to decide whether to restart it.

===Equal Protection Clause===
Bush argued that recounts in Florida violated the Equal Protection Clause because Florida did not have a statewide vote recount standard. Each county determined on its own whether a given ballot was valid. Two voters could have marked their ballots in an identical manner, but the ballot in one county would be counted while the ballot in a different county would be rejected, because of the conflicting manual recount standards.
Gore argued that there was indeed a statewide standard, the &quot;intent of the voter&quot; standard, and that this standard was sufficient under the Equal Protection Clause. Furthermore, he argued that the consequence of ruling the Florida recount unconstitutional simply because it treated different voters differently would effectively render &quot;every&quot; state election unconstitutional and that each voting mechanism has a different rate of error in counting votes. Voters in a &quot;punch-card&quot; county were more likely to have their votes undercounted than voters in an &quot;optical scanner&quot; county. If Bush prevailed, Gore argued, every state would have to have one statewide method of recording votes to be constitutional. This was the most closely decided issue in the case. The arguments presented by counsel did not extensively address what the Court should do if the Court found an equal protection violation. But Gore did argue briefly that the appropriate remedy would not be to cancel all recounts, but rather to order a proper recount.

===Article II===
Bush argued that the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling violated Article II, § 1, cl. 2 of the U.S. Constitution. Essentially, Bush argued that the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretation of Florida law was so erroneous that its ruling had the effect of making new law. Since this &quot;new law&quot; had not been enacted by the Florida legislature, it violated Article II. Bush argued that Article II gives the federal judiciary the power to interpret state election law in presidential elections to ensure that the intent of the state legislature is followed. Gore argued that Article II presupposes judicial review and interpretation of state statutes, and that the Florida Supreme Court did nothing more than exercise the routine principles of statutory construction to reach its decision.

==Decision==
In brief, the breakdown of the decision was:
*Five justices agreed that there was an Equal Protection Clause violation in using differing standards of determining a valid vote in different counties, causing an &quot;unequal evaluation of ballots in various respects&quot;. The &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion (representing the views of Justices Kennedy, O&#x27;Connor, Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas) specifically cited that:
** Palm Beach County changed standards for counting dimpled chads several times during the counting process;
** Broward County used less restrictive standards than Palm Beach County;
** Miami-Dade County&#x27;s recount of rejected ballots did not include all precincts;
** The Florida Supreme Court did not specify who would recount the ballots.
*The &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion also identified an inconsistency with the fact that the Florida statewide recount of rejected ballots was limited to undervotes. The opinion implied that a constitutionally valid recount would include Florida&#x27;s overvotes, not just its undervotes. The opinion expressed concern that the limited scope of Florida&#x27;s recount would mean that, unlike some undervotes found to be reclaimable, valid votes among the overvotes would not be reclaimed. Furthermore, if a machine had incorrectly read an overvote as a valid vote for one of two marked candidates instead of rejecting it, Florida would wrongly count what should be an invalid vote.
*Breyer and Souter disagreed with the majority, pointing out that Bush presented no evidence in any court of uncounted legal overvotes and did not see any problem in Florida&#x27;s decision to limit its recount to undervotes. The dissents of Breyer and Souter were full dissents. Unlike the five-justice majority, each identified an equal protection concern that did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation, and proposed a remedy different from the majority&#x27;s remedy. A dissenting opinion does not create precedent nor does it become a part of case law. Under the American legal system, dissenting court opinions are not considered valid holdings and are not included in the court&#x27;s ruling. Nothing in Breyer&#x27;s or Souter&#x27;s dissents can be construed as part of any decision by the Court.
*In dissenting, Ginsburg wrote that, for better or worse, disparities were a part of all elections and that if an equal-protection argument applied in any way, it surely applied more to black voters.
*Five justices agreed that December 12 (the date of the decision) was the deadline Florida had established for recounts in keeping with 3 U.S.C. §5 (Rehnquist, O&#x27;Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas in support; Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer opposed). Souter, joined by Breyer, Ginsburg and Stevens, wrote, &quot;But no State is required to conform to §5 if it cannot do that (for whatever reason); the sanction for failing to satisfy the conditions of §5 is simply loss of what has been called its &#x27;safe harbor.&#x27; And even that determination is to be made, if made anywhere, in the Congress.&quot; Souter and Breyer would have remanded the case to the Florida Supreme Court to permit that court to establish uniform standards of what constituted a legal vote for a manual recount of all rejected ballots using those standards. 
*Three justices (Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas) argued that the Florida Supreme Court had acted contrary to the intent of the Florida legislature. Four (Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer) specifically disputed this in their dissenting opinions, and the remaining two (O&#x27;Connor and Kennedy) declined to join Rehnquist&#x27;s concurrence on the matter.
===Equal Protection Clause===
In its &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that the Florida Supreme Court decision calling for a statewide recount violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Kennedy has since been identified as the opinion&#x27;s primary author. In addition to writing the opinion, he included Souter, Breyer and Stevens as agreeing that there were equal protection &quot;problems&quot; without consulting them. Stevens demanded his name be removed from the draft opinion, which Kennedy agreed to only after Stevens pulled his name from Breyer&#x27;s dissent. Breyer also objected in private. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Kennedy&#x27;s opinion &quot;later caused some confusion by its reference to &#x27;seven justices of the court&#x27; who &#x27;agree that there are constitutional problems with the recount.&#x27; That was true, but it was also beside the point.&quot; Later interviews by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; indicated that Breyer and Souter were trying to appeal to Kennedy to join them on the remedy, rather than agreeing that an equal protection violation had occurred. Jack Balkin, writing in &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, considered this a cheap trick to construct the illusion of a larger majority, likening it to &quot;saying that two doctors agree that a patient is sick, but one wants to use leeches, and the other wants to prescribe antibiotics&quot;.

The Court held that the Equal Protection Clause guarantees to individuals that their ballots cannot be devalued by &quot;later arbitrary and disparate treatment&quot;. Even if the recount was fair in theory, it was unfair in practice. The record, as weighed by the Florida Supreme Court, suggested that different standards were seemingly applied to the recount from ballot to ballot, precinct to precinct, and county to county, even when identical types of ballots and machines were used.

According to the Court, the statewide standard (that a &quot;legal vote&quot; is &quot;one in which there is a &#x27;clear indication of the intent of the voter) could not guarantee that each county would count the votes in a constitutionally permissible fashion. The Court stated that the &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion&#x27;s applicability was &quot;limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.&quot; But the Court did not identify those complexities, nor did it explain (or apparently consider) why the absence of a constitutionally acceptable standard for counting votes, which was the basis for the Court&#x27;s ruling, would not have invalidated the entire presidential election in Florida. Critics later observed that the court had denied &quot;certiorari&quot; on equal protection grounds when Bush first sought Supreme Court review. Law clerks who worked for Kennedy and O&#x27;Connor at the time later said they believed the justices settled on equal protection as grounds for their decision, rather than Article II, because they thought it would seem fairer.

====Remedy====
The Court ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by a December 12 &quot;safe harbor&quot; deadline. The Court asserted that &quot;the Supreme Court of Florida has said that the legislature intended the State&#x27;s electors to &#x27;participat[e] fully in the federal electoral process,&#x27; as provided in .&quot; The Court therefore effectively ended the proposed recount, because &quot;the Florida Legislature intended to obtain the safe-harbor benefits of 3 U.S.C. §5.&quot; Souter said bluntly, &quot;The 3 U.S.C. §5 issue is not serious.&quot; Breyer&#x27;s dissent stated, &quot;By halting the manual recount, and thus ensuring that uncounted legal votes will not be counted under any standard, this Court crafts a remedy out of proportion to the asserted harm. And that remedy harms the very fairness interests the Court is attempting to protect.&quot;

Four justices (Stevens, Ginsburg, Souter and Breyer) had dissented from the Court&#x27;s earlier (December 9) decision, by the same five-justice majority, to grant Bush&#x27;s emergency request to stop the recount and grant &quot;certiorari&quot;. In their dissents from the Court&#x27;s December 12 &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion, Breyer and Souter acknowledged that the counting up until December 9 had not conformed with equal protection requirements. But Souter and Breyer favored remanding the case to the Florida Supreme Court for the purpose of crafting specific guidelines for how to count disputed ballots, in contrast to the majority&#x27;s decision to halt the recount altogether. The actual counting had ended with the December 9 ruling, issued three days before any deadline. The dissenting opinions strongly criticized the majority for involving the Court in state-level affairs. Stevens&#x27;s dissent (joined by Breyer and Ginsburg) concluded as follows:

The &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion did not technically dismiss the case and instead &quot;remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&quot; Gore&#x27;s attorneys therefore understood that they could fight on and could petition the Florida Supreme Court to repudiate the notion that December 12 was final under Florida law. Despite this, Gore dropped the case—and conceded the election to Bush shortly afterward—reportedly because he was not optimistic about how the Florida justices would react to further arguments and, as one of his advisers put it, &quot;the best Gore could hope for was a slate of disputed electors&quot;. In addition, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley argued that fighting on was futile because even if the Florida Supreme Court defied the U.S. Supreme Court and ordered a new recount, &quot;the GOP would take them straight back to Washington, where the [U.S.] Supreme Court would repeat: &#x27;You ain&#x27;t going to count, okay? So quit bothering us.

On remand, the Florida Supreme Court issued an opinion on December 22 that did not dispute whether December 12 was the deadline for recounts under state law. This was disputed in a concurring opinion by Florida Supreme Court Justice Leander Shaw, who nevertheless expressed deference to the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s view on this issue and also argued that, in any case, the Florida Supreme Court would (in his opinion) be unable to craft a remedy that would satisfy all the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s equal protection, due process, and other concerns.

===Article II===
Rehnquist&#x27;s concurring opinion, joined by Scalia and Thomas, began by emphasizing that this was an unusual case in which the Constitution requires federal courts to assess whether a state supreme court has properly interpreted the will of the state legislature. Usually, federal courts do not make that type of assessment, and indeed the &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion in this case did not do so. After addressing this aspect of the case, Rehnquist examined and agreed with arguments that the dissenting justices of the Florida Supreme Court had made. Rehnquist also mentioned that he, Scalia, and Thomas joined the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion and agreed with the legal analysis presented there. The ruling also says that &quot;the state legislature&#x27;s power to select the manner for appointing electors is plenary; it may, if it so chooses, select the electors itself, which indeed was the manner used by state legislatures in several States for many years after the framing of our Constitution. ... The State, of course, after granting the franchise in the special context of Article II, can take back the power to appoint electors.&quot;

==Scholarly analyses==
&quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; prompted many strong reactions from scholars, pundits and others, with a majority of publications in law reviews being critical. A &quot;Georgetown Law Journal&quot; analysis found that 78 scholarly articles were published about the case between 2001 and 2004, with 35 criticizing the decision and 11 defending it.

===Critical remedial issue===
The most closely decided aspect of the case was the key question of what remedy the Court should order, in view of an Equal Protection Clause violation. Gore had argued for a new recount that would pass constitutional muster, but the Court instead chose to end the election. Citing two Florida Supreme Court opinions, &quot;Gore v. Harris&quot; (December 8, seemingly in error) and &quot;Palm Beach County Canvassing Board v. Harris&quot; (November 21, footnote 55), the U.S. Supreme Court asserted that &quot;the Florida Supreme Court has said that the Florida Legislature intended to obtain the safe-harbor benefits of 3 U.S.C. § 5&quot; and that &quot;any recount seeking to meet the December 12 date will be unconstitutional&quot;. This assertion has proven very controversial.

Finding that reasoning unpersuasive, Michael W. McConnell writes that the two Florida court opinions the Supreme Court cited supply no authoritative pronouncement of an absolute deadline. As better support for December 12 as the deadline under state law, McConnell points to two footnotes in the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s December 11 response on remand in &quot;Palm Beach County Canvassing Board v. Harris (Harris I)&quot;, which he says must not have come to the justices&#x27; attention. Footnotes 17 and 22 called the safe harbor date of December 12 an &quot;outside deadline&quot;. Therefore, he writes, although these passages may not justify the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, since the Court did not rely on them, &quot;the Court may have reached the right result for the wrong reason&quot;. These footnotes state:

According to Nelson Lund, former law clerk to O&#x27;Connor and associate counsel to George H. W. Bush, a dissenter might argue that the Florida Supreme Court on remand in &quot;Harris I&quot; was discussing the &quot;protest provisions of the Florida Election Code, whereas the issues in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; arose under the contest provisions&quot;. In retort to himself, Lund writes that the Florida court&#x27;s decision in the contest case did not mention any alternative possible deadlines. Peter Berkowitz writes, &quot;Perhaps it would have been more generous for the Court to have asked the Florida court on remand whether &#x27;outside deadline&#x27; referred to contest-period as well as protest-period recounts.&quot; Abner Greene points to evidence that &quot;the Florida Supreme Court thought all manual recounts—whether protest or contest—must be completed no later than December 12.&quot; Nevertheless, Greene concludes &quot;lack of clarity about the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s views on the safe-harbor provision should have resulted in a remand to that court for clarification&quot;, in addition to the remand of December 4. The Court in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; did remand the case instead of dismissing it, but the remand did not include another request for clarification. Louise Weinberg argues that even giving the U.S. Supreme Court the benefit of the doubt that it acted appropriately in intervening in Florida state law, its actions should be deemed unconstitutional because its intervention was not coupled with any kind of remedy aimed at determining the election&#x27;s actual outcome.

Arguably, the Florida Supreme Court, after having stated on December 11 that December 12 was an &quot;outside deadline&quot;, could have clarified its views on the safe-harbor provision or reinterpreted Florida law to state that December 12 was not a final deadline under Florida law, which the U.S. Supreme Court did not forbid the Florida Supreme Court from doing. Lund states that, as a practical matter, the Florida Supreme Court was unlikely to have actually been capable of conducting and completing a new constitutionally valid recount by the December 18 deadline for the meeting of the Electoral College.

Michael Abramowicz and Maxwell Stearns argue that if the Florida Supreme Court had clarified or reinterpreted Florida state law on remand, then the U.S. Supreme Court might have struck down the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s action as a violation of Article II of the Constitution. Abramowicz and Stearns point out that while Kennedy and O&#x27;Connor did not join Rehnquist&#x27;s Article II concurrence, they did not explicitly oppose it either, and thus kept the door open to nullifying a future ruling of the Florida Supreme Court on Article II grounds. Abramowicz and Stearns also argue that if the &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; decision genuinely allowed the Florida Supreme Court to clarify or reinterpret Florida state law and thus to order a new manual recount, then Souter and Breyer likely would have joined the opinion—which they did not. Laurence Tribe has a similar view on this issue, arguing that &quot;[e]ven assuming the leeway [in regard to the remedy] the Court theoretically left open was real, the window it had failed to slam shut was hardly the sort of opening through which anyone would dare to crawl.&quot;

===Limitation &quot;to present circumstances&quot;===
Some critics of the decision argue that the majority seemed to seek refuge from their own logic in the following sentence in the majority opinion: &quot;Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.&quot; The Court&#x27;s defenders argued that this was a reasonable precaution against the possibility that the decision might be read too broadly, arguing that in the short time available it would be inappropriate to attempt to craft language spelling out in greater detail how to apply the holding to other cases. But critics interpreted the sentence as stating that the case did not set precedent in any way and could not be used to justify any future court decision, and some suggested that this was evidence the majority realized its holding was untenable. Regardless of whether the majority intended the decision to be precedential, several federal courts have cited it in election cases, as did a lawyer for a Republican congressional candidate during legal arguments coincident with the 2020 United States presidential election.

===Accusation of partisanship or conflict of interest===
According to legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, &quot;&quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; broke David Souter&#x27;s heart. &quot;The day the music died&quot;, he called it. It was so political, so &quot;transparently&quot; political, that it scarred Souter&#x27;s belief in the Supreme Court as an institution&quot; (italics in original). Various authors argued that conservative Republican-appointed justices ruled against Gore in this case for partisan reasons. Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz writes:
Chapman University School of Law professor Ronald Rotunda responded that Democratic-appointed justices of the Florida Supreme Court also ruled against Gore:
There has been further analysis of whether several justices had a conflict of interest that should have forced them to recuse themselves from the decision. On several occasions, Rehnquist had expressed interest in retiring under a Republican administration; one study found that press reports &quot;are equivocal on whether facts existed that would have created a conflict of interest&quot; for him. At an election night party, O&#x27;Connor became upset when it was reported that Gore had won Florida, her husband explaining that they would have to wait another four years before retiring to Arizona. Both justices remained on the Court until Bush&#x27;s second term, with Rehnquist dying in 2005 and O&#x27;Connor retiring in 2006. According to Steven Foster of the Manchester Grammar School:

The day after Thanksgiving, when the conservative justices agreed to hear Bush&#x27;s appeal in the case of &quot;Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board&quot; (excluding Bush&#x27;s equal protection claim), the opposing justices were convinced that the majority intended to reverse the Florida Supreme Court and shut down the recount. They began drafting a dissent before this case was argued before them, a dissent that was temporarily shelved upon the Court&#x27;s unanimous remand to the Florida court.

The liberal law clerks noted that Scalia later had begun campaigning for the stay of the Florida court&#x27;s December 8 recount order before the Court had received Gore&#x27;s response to Bush&#x27;s request, and was so incensed at Stevens&#x27;s dissent in the matter of the stay and grant of &quot;certiorari&quot; that he requested the release of opinions be delayed so that he could amend his opinion to include a response to Stevens. Kennedy is also reported to have sent out a memo accusing the dissenters of &quot;trashing the court&quot;. Later, court personnel, as well as Ron Klain, speculated that there was an unspoken understanding that the judges on the winning side would not retire until after the next election, as a way of preserving some sense of fairness. No justices retired during President Bush&#x27;s first term.

It has been argued that none of the justices voted in a way that was consistent with their prior jurisprudence, although George Mason University law professor Nelson Lund has challenged this conclusion, arguing that, unlike in suspect classification cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has never actually required a showing of intentional discrimination in fundamental rights cases, such as &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;. The five conservative justices decided to involve the federal judiciary in a matter that could have been left to the states, while also expanding previous U.S. Supreme Court interpretations of the Equal Protection Clause. Meanwhile, the liberal justices all supported leaving the matter in the hands of a state and also sometimes advocated in favor of a narrower reading of existing Equal Protection Clause precedents. This bolstered the perception that the justices used their desired result to drive their reasoning. David Cole of Georgetown Law argued that, as a way of trying to rehabilitate the court&#x27;s image after &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, the Court became more likely to reach a liberal decision in the four years after &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; than it had been before the case, and that the conservative justices were more likely to join the liberals rather than the other way around.

===Recount by media organizations===
In 2001, the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, sponsored by a consortium of major United States news organizations, conducted the Florida Ballot Project, a comprehensive review of 175,010 ballots that vote-counting machines had rejected from the entire state, not just the counties that conducted manual recounts. The project&#x27;s goal was to determine the reliability and accuracy of the systems used in the voting process, including how different systems correlated with voter mistakes. The study was conducted over a period of 10 months. Based on the review, the media group concluded that if the disputes over the validity of all the ballots in question had been consistently resolved and any uniform standard applied, the electoral result would have been reversed and Gore would have won by 60 to 171 votes. On the other hand, under scenarios involving review of limited sets of ballots uncounted by machines, Bush would have kept his lead. In one such scenario—Gore&#x27;s request for recounts in four predominantly Democratic counties—Bush would have won by 225 votes. In another scenario (if the remaining 64 Florida counties had carried out the hand recount of disputed ballots the Florida Supreme Court ordered on December 8, applying the various standards that county election officials said they would have used), Bush would have emerged the victor by 493 votes.

The scenarios involving limited sets of ballots included the completed uncertified recount by Palm Beach County, which nevertheless had excluded a set-aside cache of dimpled ballots with clear indications of intent, an uncounted net gain of 682 votes for Gore. In contrast, the scenarios involving all uncounted ballots statewide considered all votes from Palm Beach County, subjected to various standards of inclusion. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; qualified the tallies conducted by the NORC consortium with the statement: &quot;But no study of this type can accurately recreate Election Day 2000 or predict what might have emerged from individual battles over more than 6 million votes in Florida&#x27;s 67 counties.&quot;

Further analysis revealed that black-majority precincts had three times as many rejected ballots as white precincts. &quot;For minorities, the ballot survey found, a recount would not have redressed the inequities because most ballots were beyond retrieving. But a recount could have restored the votes of thousands of older voters whose dimpled and double-voted ballots were indecipherable to machines but would have been clear in a ballot-by-ballot review.&quot;

===Critiques===

Several articles have characterized the decision as damaging the reputation of the court, increasing the view of judges as partisan, and decreasing Americans&#x27; trust in the integrity of elections, an outcome Stevens predicted in his dissent. Part of the reason recounts could not be completed was the various stoppages ordered by the various branches and levels of the judiciary, most notably the Supreme Court. Opponents argued that it was improper for the Court (by the same five justices who joined the &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion) to grant a stay that preliminarily stopped the recounts based on Bush&#x27;s likelihood of success on the merits and possible irreparable injury to Bush. Although stay orders normally do not include justification, Scalia concurred to express some brief reasoning to justify it, saying that one potential irreparable harm was that an invalid recount might undermine the legitimacy of Bush&#x27;s election (presumably if, for example, it were to find that Gore should have won). Supporters of the stay, such as Charles Fried, contend that the stay&#x27;s validity was vindicated by the ultimate decision on the merits and that the only thing the stay prevented was a recount &quot;done in an unconstitutional way&quot;.

Some critics argued that the Court&#x27;s decision was a perversion of the Equal Protection Clause and contrary to the political question doctrine. Scott Lemieux of University of Washington points out that if recounting votes without a uniform statewide standard were truly a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, this should have meant that the initial count, which also lacked a uniform standard, was itself unconstitutional. On the other hand, Geoffrey R. Stone has expressed sympathy with the Court&#x27;s equal protection reasoning, even though Stone was dismayed by what he saw as the sudden and suspect conversion of Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas to that equal protection principle. According to Stone:

Stevens&#x27;s criticism of the Court in his dissent for questioning the impartiality of Florida&#x27;s judiciary was itself criticized by Lund, a former law clerk for O&#x27;Connor. Professor Charles Zelden faults the &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion in the case for, among other things, not declaring that the nation&#x27;s electoral system required significant reform, and for not condemning administration of elections by part-time boards of elections dominated by partisan and unprofessional officials. Zelden concludes that the Court&#x27;s failure to spotlight this critical flaw in American electoral democracy made a replay of &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; more likely, not less likely, either in Florida or elsewhere. In 2013, O&#x27;Connor, who had voted with the majority, said that the case &quot;gave the court a less-than-perfect reputation&quot;. She added, &quot;Maybe the court should have said, &#x27;We&#x27;re not going to take it, goodbye.&#x27; ... And probably the Supreme Court added to the problem at the end of the day.&quot;

A &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article quotes several of the court&#x27;s clerks at the time who were critical of the decision. They note that, despite the &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion&#x27;s declaration that the case was taken &quot;reluctantly&quot;, Kennedy had been rather enthusiastic about taking the case all along. They felt at the time, as had many legal scholars, that the case was unlikely to go to the Supreme Court at all. In fact some of the justices were so certain that the case would never come before them that they had already left for vacations.

==Public reaction==
Editorials in the country&#x27;s leading newspapers were overwhelmingly critical of the decision. A review by &quot;The Georgetown Law Journal&quot; found that the nation&#x27;s top newspapers, by circulation, had published 18 editorials criticizing the decision and six praising it. They similarly published 26 op-eds criticizing the decision and eight defending it. Polls showed a range of reactions, with 37–65% of respondents believing that personal politics influenced the justices&#x27; decisions, depending on the poll. A Princeton Survey poll recorded 46% of respondents saying that the decision made them more likely to suspect partisan bias in judges in general. An NBC News/&quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; poll showed that 53% of respondents believed that the decision to stop the recount was based mostly on politics. A 2010 &quot;Slate&quot; article listed the case as the first in a series of events that eroded American trust in the results of elections, noting that the number of lawsuits brought over election issues had more than doubled since &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;.

<doc id="105825" wikidata="Q7487" url="?curid=105825" title="Dorothy Hodgkin">
<text>Dorothy Mary Crowfoot Hodgkin (née Crowfoot; 12 May 1910 – 29 July 1994) was a Nobel Prize-winning English chemist who advanced the technique of X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of biomolecules, which became essential for structural biology.

Among her most influential discoveries are the confirmation of the structure of penicillin as previously surmised by Edward Abraham and Ernst Boris Chain; and mapping the structure of vitamin B12, for which in 1964 she became the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Hodgkin also elucidated the structure of insulin in 1969 after 35 years of work.

Hodgkin used the name &quot;Dorothy Crowfoot&quot; until twelve years after marrying Thomas Lionel Hodgkin, when she began using &quot;Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin&quot;. Hodgkin is referred to as &quot;Dorothy Hodgkin&quot; by the Royal Society (when referring to its sponsorship of the Dorothy Hodgkin fellowship), and by Somerville College. The National Archives of the United Kingdom refer to her as &quot;Dorothy Mary Crowfoot Hodgkin&quot;.

==Early life==
Dorothy Mary Crowfoot was born in Cairo, Egypt, the oldest of the four daughters whose parents worked in North Africa and the middle East in the colonial administration and later as archaeologists. Dorothy came from a distinguished family of archaeologists. Her parents were John Winter Crowfoot (1873–1959), working for the country&#x27;s Ministry of Education, and his wife Grace Mary (née Hood) (1877–1957), known to friends and family as Molly. The family lived in Cairo during the winter months, returning to England each year to avoid the hotter part of the season in Egypt.

In 1914, Hodgkin&#x27;s mother left her (age 4) and her two younger sisters Joan (age 2) and Elisabeth (age 7 months) with their Crowfoot grandparents near Worthing, and returned to her husband in Egypt. They spent much of their childhood apart from their parents, yet they were supportive from afar. Her mother would encourage Dorothy to pursue the interest in crystals first displayed at the age of 10. In 1923, Dorothy and her sister would study pebbles that they had found in nearby streams using portable mineral analysis kit. Their parents then moved south to Sudan where, until 1926, her father was in charge of education and archaeology. Her mother&#x27;s four brothers were killed in World War I and as a result she became an ardent supporter of the new League of Nations.

In 1921 Hodgkin&#x27;s father entered her in the Sir John Leman Grammar School in Beccles, England, where she was one of two girls allowed to study chemistry. Only once, when she was 13, did she make an extended visit to her parents, then living in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, where her father was Principal of Gordon College. When she was 14, her distant cousin, the chemist Charles Harington (later Sir Charles), recommended D. S. Parsons&#x27; &quot;Fundamentals of Biochemistry&quot;. Resuming the pre-war pattern, her parents lived and worked abroad for part of the year, returning to England and their children for several months every summer. In 1926, on his retirement from the Sudan Civil Service, her father took the post of Director of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, where he and her mother remained until 1935.

In 1928, Hodgkin joined her parents at the archaeological site of Jerash, in present-day Jordan, where she documented the patterns of mosaics from multiple Byzantine-era Churches dated to the 5th–6th centuries. She spent more than a year finishing the drawings as she started her studies in Oxford, while also conducting chemical analyses of glass tesserae from the same site. Her attention to detail through the creation of precise scale drawings of these mosaics mirrors her subsequent work in recognising and documenting patterns in chemistry. Hodgkin enjoyed the experience of field archaeology so much that she considered giving up chemistry in favour of archaeology. Her drawings are archived by Yale University.

Hodgkin developed a passion for chemistry from a young age, and her mother, a proficient botanist, fostered her interest in the sciences. On her 16th birthday her mother gave her a book by W. H. Bragg on X-ray crystallography, &quot;Concerning the Nature of Things&quot;, which helped her decide her future. She was further encouraged by the chemist A.F. Joseph, a family friend who also worked in Sudan.

Her state school education did not include Latin, then required for entrance to Oxbridge. Her Leman School headmaster, George Watson, gave her personal tuition in the subject, enabling her to pass the University of Oxford entrance examination.

When Hodgkin was asked in later life to name her childhood heroes, she named three women: first and foremost, her mother, Molly; the medical missionary Mary Slessor; and Margery Fry, the Principal of Somerville College.

==Higher education==
In 1928 at age 18 Hodgkin entered Somerville College, Oxford, where she studied chemistry. She graduated in 1932 with a first-class honours degree, the third woman at this institution to achieve this distinction.

In the autumn of that year, she began studying for a PhD at Newnham College, Cambridge, under the supervision of John Desmond Bernal. It was then that she became aware of the potential of X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of proteins. She was working with Bernal on the technique&#x27;s first application to the analysis of a biological substance, pepsin. The pepsin experiment is largely credited to Hodgkin, however she always made it clear that it was Bernal who initially took the photographs and gave her additional key insights. Her PhD was awarded in 1937 for research on X-ray crystallography and the chemistry of sterols.

==Career and discoveries==

In 1933 Hodgkin was awarded a research fellowship by Somerville College, and in 1934, she moved back to Oxford. She started teaching chemistry with her own lab equipment. The college appointed her its first fellow and tutor in chemistry in 1936, a post which she held until 1977. In the 1940s, one of her students was Margaret Roberts (later Margaret Thatcher) who, while Prime Minister, hung a portrait of Hodgkin in her office at Downing Street out of respect for her former teacher. Hodgkin was, however a life-long Labour Party supporter.

In April 1953, together with Sydney Brenner, Jack Dunitz, Leslie Orgel, and Beryl M. Oughton, Hodgkin was one of the first people to travel from Oxford to Cambridge to see the model of the double helix structure of DNA, constructed by Francis Crick and James Watson, which was based on data and technique acquired by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin. According to the late Dr Beryl Oughton (married name, Rimmer), they drove to Cambridge in two cars after Hodgkin announced that they were off to see the model of the structure of DNA.

Hodgkin became a reader at Oxford in 1957 and she was given a fully modern laboratory the following year. In 1960, Hodgkin was appointed the Royal Society&#x27;s Wolfson Research Professor, a position she held until 1970. This provided her salary, research expenses and research assistance to continue her work at the University of Oxford. She was a fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, from 1977 to 1983.

===Steroid structure===
Hodgkin was particularly noted for discovering three-dimensional biomolecular structures. In 1945, working with C.H. (Harry) Carlisle, she published the first such structure of a steroid, cholesteryl iodide (having worked with cholesteryls since the days of her doctoral studies).

===Penicillin structure===
In 1945, Hodgkin and her colleagues, including biochemist Barbara Low, solved the structure of penicillin, demonstrating, contrary to scientific opinion at the time, that it contains a β-lactam ring. The work was not published until 1949.

===Vitamin B12 structure===
In 1948, Hodgkin first encountered vitamin B12, one of the most structurally complex vitamins known, and created new crystals. Vitamin B12 had first been discovered at Merck earlier that year. It had a structure at the time that was almost completely unknown, and when Hodgkin discovered it contained cobalt, she realized the structure actualization could be determined by X-ray crystallography analysis. The large size of the molecule, and the fact that the atoms were largely unaccounted for—aside from cobalt—posed a challenge in structure analysis that had not been previously explored.

From these crystals, she deduced the presence of a ring structure because the crystals were pleochroic, a finding which she later confirmed using X-ray crystallography. The B12 study published by Hodgkin was described by Lawrence Bragg as being as significant &quot;as breaking the sound barrier&quot;. Scientists from Merck had previously crystallised B12, but had published only refractive indices of the substance. The final structure of B12, for which Hodgkin was later awarded the Nobel Prize, was published in 1955 and 1956.

===Insulin structure===
Insulin was one of Hodgkin&#x27;s most extraordinary research projects. It began in 1934 when she was offered a small sample of crystalline insulin by Robert Robinson. The hormone captured her imagination because of the intricate and wide-ranging effect it has in the body. However, at this stage X-ray crystallography had not been developed far enough to cope with the complexity of the insulin molecule. She and others spent many years improving the technique.

It took 35 years after taking her first photograph of an insulin crystal for X-ray crystallography and computing techniques to be able to tackle larger and more complex molecules like insulin. Hodgkin&#x27;s dream of unlocking the structure of insulin was put on hold until 1969 when she was finally able to work with her team of young, international scientists to uncover the structure for the first time. Hodgkin&#x27;s work with insulin was instrumental in paving the way for insulin to be mass-produced and used on a large scale for treatment of both type one and type two diabetes. She went on to cooperate with other laboratories active in insulin research, giving advice, and traveling the world giving talks about insulin and its importance for the future of diabetes. Solving the structure of insulin had two important implications for the treatment of diabetes, both making mass production of insulin possible and allowing scientists to alter the structure of insulin to create even better drug options for patients going forward.

==Personal life==

=== Personality ===
Hodgkin&#x27;s soft-spoken, gentle and modest demeanor hid a steely determination to achieve her ends, whatever obstacles might stand in her way. She inspired devotion in her students and colleagues, even the most junior of whom knew her simply as Dorothy. Her structural studies of biologically important molecules set standards for a field that was very much in development during her work life. She made fundamental contributions to the understanding of how these molecules carry out their tasks in living system.

===Mentor===
Hodgkin&#x27;s mentor Professor John Desmond Bernal greatly influenced her life: scientifically, politically, and personally. Bernal was a key scientific adviser to the UK government during the Second World War. He was also an open and vocal member of the Communist Party and a faithful supporter of the Soviet regime until its invasion of Hungary in 1956. He was a chemist who believed in equal opportunity for women. In his laboratory, Hodgkin extended work that he began on biological molecules including sterols. She helped him to make the first X-ray diffraction studies of pepsin and crystalline protein. Hodgkin always referred to him as &quot;Sage&quot;. They were lovers before she met Thomas Hodgkin. The marriages of both Dorothy and Bernal were unconventional by the standards of the present and of those days.

===Health===
In 1934, at the age of 24, Dorothy began experiencing pain in her hands causing them to become swollen and distorted. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and went to a clinic in Buxton for thermal baths and gold treatments. After some treatment, Hodgkin returned to the lab, where she struggled to use the main switch on the x-ray equipment due to the condition of her hands. She had to create a lever on her own in order to utilize the switch. Her condition would become progressively worse and debilitating over time, with deformities in both her hands and feet, and prolonged periods of pain. While Hodgkin spent a great deal of time in a wheelchair in her later years, she remained scientifically active in her career.

===Marriage and family===
In 1937, Dorothy Crowfoot married Thomas Lionel Hodgkin, an historian&#x27;s son, who was then teaching an adult-education class in mining and industrial communities in the north of England after he resigned from the Colonial Office. He was an intermittent member of the Communist Party and later wrote several major works on African politics and history, becoming a well-known lecturer at Balliol College in Oxford. As his health was too poor for active military service, he continued working throughout World War II, returning to Oxford on the weekends, where his wife remained working on penicillin. The couple had three children: Luke (b. 1938. d. Oct. 2020), Elizabeth (b. 1941) and Toby (b. 1946). The oldest son, Luke, became a mathematics instructor at the new University of Warwick. Their daughter, Elizabeth, followed her father&#x27;s career as a historian. Their younger son, Toby, studied botany and agriculture. Overall, Thomas Hodgkin spent extended periods of time in West Africa, where he was an enthusiastic supporter and chronicler of the emerging postcolonial states.

===Aliases===
Hodgkin published as &quot;Dorothy Crowfoot&quot; until 1949, when she was persuaded by Hans Clarke&#x27;s secretary to use her married name on a chapter she contributed to &quot;The Chemistry of Penicillin&quot;. By then she had been married for 12 years, given birth to three children and been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).

Thereafter she would publish as &quot;Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin&quot;, and this was the name used by the Nobel Foundation in its award to her and the biography it included among other Nobel Prize recipients; it is also what the Science History Institute calls her. For simplicity&#x27;s sake, Hodgkin is referred to as &quot;Dorothy Hodgkin&quot; by the Royal Society, when referring to its sponsorship of the Dorothy Hodgkin fellowship, and by Somerville College, after it inaugurated the annual lectures in her honour.

The National Archives of the United Kingdom refer to her as &quot;Dorothy Mary Crowfoot Hodgkin&quot;; on a variety of plaques commemorating places where she worked or lived, e.g. 94 Woodstock Road, Oxford, she is &quot;Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin&quot;. In 2022, the Department of Biochemistry in Oxford renamed its much expanded building after Hodgkin, calling it the &quot;Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin Building&quot;.

===Contacts with scientists abroad===
Between the 1950s and the 1970s, Hodgkin established and maintained lasting contacts with scientists in her field abroad—at the Institute of Crystallography in Moscow; in India; and with the Chinese group working in Beijing and Shanghai on the structure of insulin.

Her first visit to China was in 1959. Over the next quarter century, she travelled there seven more times, the last visit a year before her death. Particularly memorable was the visit in 1971 after the Chinese group themselves independently solved the structure of insulin, later than Hodgkin&#x27;s team but to a higher resolution. During the subsequent three years, 1972–1975, when she was President of the International Union of Crystallography she was unable to persuade the Chinese authorities, however, to permit the country&#x27;s scientists to become members of the Union and attend its meetings.

Her relations with a supposed scientist in another &quot;People&#x27;s Democracy&quot; had less happy results. At the age of 73, Hodgkin wrote a foreword to the English edition of &quot;Stereospecific Polymerization of Isoprene&quot;, published by Robert Maxwell as the work of Elena Ceaușescu, wife of Romania&#x27;s communist dictator. Hodgkin wrote of the author&#x27;s &quot;outstanding achievements&quot; and &quot;impressive&quot; career. Following the overthrow of Ceausescu during the Romanian Revolution of 1989, it was revealed that Elena Ceausescu had neither finished secondary school nor attended university. Her scientific credentials were a hoax, and the publication in question was written for her by a team of scientists to obtain a fraudulent doctorate.

===Political views and activities===
Because of Hodgkin&#x27;s political activities, and her husband&#x27;s association with the Communist Party, she was banned from entering the US in 1953 and subsequently not allowed to visit the country except by CIA waiver.

In 1961 Thomas became an advisor to Kwame Nkrumah, President of Ghana, a country he visited for extended periods before Nkrumah&#x27;s ouster in 1966. Hodgkin was in Ghana with her husband when they received the news that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize.

She acquired from her mother, Molly, a concern about social inequalities and a determination to do what she could to prevent armed conflict. Dorothy became particularly concerned about the threat of nuclear war. In 1976, she became president of the Pugwash Conference and served longer than any who preceded or succeeded her in this post. She stepped down in 1988, the year after the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty imposed &quot;a global ban on short- and long-range nuclear weapons systems, as well as an intrusive verification regime&quot;. She accepted the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet government in 1987 in recognition of her work for peace and disarmament.

===Disability and death===
Due to distance, Hodgkin decided not to attend the 1987 Congress of the International Union of Crystallography in Australia. However, despite increasing frailty, she astounded close friends and family by going to Beijing for the 1993 Congress, where she was welcomed by all.

She died in July 1994 after a stroke, at her husband&#x27;s home in the village of Ilmington, near Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire.

==Portraits==
The National Portrait Gallery, London lists 17 portraits of Dorothy Hodgkin including an oil painting of her at her desk by Maggi Hambling and a photograph portrait by David Montgomery.

Graham Sutherland made preliminary sketches for a portrait of Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1978. One sketch is in the collection of the Science History Institute and another at the Royal Society in London. The portrait was never finished.

A portrait of Dorothy Hodgkin by Bryan Organ was commissioned by private subscription to become part of the collection of the Royal Society. Accepted by the president of the society on 25 March 1982, it was the first portrait of a woman Fellow to be included in the Society&#x27;s collection.

==Honours and awards==
===While living===
* By 1945 she had succeeded in identifying the structure of vitamin B12, describing the arrangement of its atoms in three dimensions.
*Hodgkin won the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and is the only British woman scientist to have been awarded a Nobel Prize in any of the three sciences it recognizes.
*In 1965 she was appointed to the Order of Merit. She was the to receive the Order. 
*In 1976, she was the first woman to receive the prestigious Copley Medal.
*In 1947, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1947 and EMBO Membership in 1970.
*Hodgkin was Chancellor of the University of Bristol from 1970 to 1988.
*She was given an honorary Degree of Science from University of Bath in 1978. 
*In 1958, she was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
*In 1966, she was awarded the Iota Sigma Pi National Honorary Member for her significant contribution.
*She became a foreign member of the USSR Academy of Sciences in the 1970s.
*In 1982 she received the Lomonosov Medal of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
*In 1987 she accepted the Lenin Peace Prize from the government of Mikhail Gorbachev and was the first woman to receive the Copley Medal in 1976. 
*An asteroid (5422) discovered on 23 December 1982 by L.G. Karachkina (at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, M.P.C. 22509, in the USSR) in 1993 was named &quot;Hodgkin&quot; in her honour. 
*In 1983, Hodgkin received the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art.

===Legacy===
*British commemorative stamps – Hodgkin was one of five &#x27;Women of Achievement&#x27; selected for a set issued in August 1996. The others were Marea Hartman (sports administrator), Margot Fonteyn (ballerina/choreographer), Elisabeth Frink (sculptor) &amp; Daphne du Maurier (writer). All except Hodgkin were Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBEs). In 2010, during the 350th anniversary of the founding of the Royal Society, Hodgkin was the only woman in a set of stamps celebrating ten of the Society&#x27;s most illustrious members, taking her place alongside Isaac Newton, Edward Jenner, Joseph Lister, Benjamin Franklin, Charles Babbage, Robert Boyle, Ernest Rutherford, Nicholas Shackleton and Alfred Russel Wallace.
*The Royal Society awards the Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship (named in her honour) &quot;for outstanding scientists at an early stage of their research career who require a flexible working pattern due to personal circumstances, such as parenting or caring responsibilities or health-related reasons.&quot;
*The Council offices in the London Borough of Hackney and buildings at University of York, Bristol University and Keele University are named after her, as is the science block at Sir John Leman High School, her former school.
*In 2012, Hodgkin was featured in the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The New Elizabethans&quot; to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. In this series a panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named her among the group of people in the UK &quot;whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character&quot;.
*In 2015 Hodgkin&#x27;s 1949 paper &quot;The X-ray Crystallographic Investigation of the Structure of Penicillin&quot; was honoured by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society presented to the University of Oxford (England). This research is notable for its groundbreaking use of X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of complex natural products, in this instance, of penicillin.
*Since 1999, the Oxford International Women&#x27;s Festival has presented the annual Dorothy Hodgkin Memorial Lecture, usually in March, in honour of Hodgkin&#x27;s work. The Lecture is a collaboration between Oxford AWiSE (Association for Women in Science &amp; Engineering), Somerville College and the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.

<text>Buckfast Abbey forms part of an active Benedictine monastery at Buckfast, near Buckfastleigh, Devon, England. Buckfast first became home to an abbey in 1018. The first Benedictine abbey was followed by a Savignac, later Cistercian, abbey constructed on the site of the current abbey in 1134. The monastery was largely demolished after its dissolution in 1539. In 1882 the site was purchased by French Benedictines who refounded a monastery on the site. New monastic buildings incorporated the remaining Gothic house. Buckfast was formally reinstated as an abbey in 1902. Work on a new abbey church, which was constructed mostly on the footprint of the former Cistercian abbey, started in 1907. The church was completed in 1938. As of 2020, the abbey has 13 monks.

==History==
===Early history===

The first abbey at Buckfast was founded as a Benedictine monastery in 1018. The abbey was believed to be founded by either Aethelweard (Aylward), Earldorman of Devon, or King Cnut. This first monastery was &quot;small and unprosperous&quot;, and the exact site is uncertain. Archaeological evidence suggests the monastery may have been located nearby at what is now Holy Trinity church in Buckfastleigh.

In 1134 or 1136, the abbey was established in its current position, King Stephen having granted Buckfast to the French Abbot of Savigny. This second abbey was home to Savignac monks. In 1147 the Savignac congregation merged with the Cistercian, and the abbey thereby became a Cistercian monastery. Following the conversion to the Cistercian Congregation, the abbey was rebuilt in stone. Limited excavation work undertaken in 1882 revealed that the monastery was built to the standard plan for Cistercian monasteries. At an uncertain point in the late 12th or 13th centuries the church was extended with aisles added to the presbytery. The buttressed chapel at the east end was probably a 14th century addition, and may have been a Lady Chapel. This would be unusual in a Cistercian abbey, as normally the entire church was dedicated to St Mary.

In medieval times the abbey became rich through fishing and trading in sheep wool. By the 14th century Buckfast was one of the wealthiest abbeys in the south-west of England. It had come to own &quot;extensive sheep runs on Dartmoor, seventeen manors in central and south Devon, town houses in Exeter, fisheries on the Dart and the Avon, and a country house for the abbot at Kingsbridge&quot;. At Kingsbridge the abbey had the rights to a weekly market and an annual fair, leading to the growth of the town. The Black Death killed two abbots and many monks. By the mid 1300s, there were few left to maintain the buildings, some of which collapsed. By the mid 1400s, the abbey again flourished. The 19th century excavations suggested that there was major rebuilding work at this time, of which the tower attached to the abbot&#x27;s house is the sole upstanding survival.

By the 16th century, the abbey was in decline. Only 22 new monks were tonsured between 1500 and 1539, and at the time of the abbey&#x27;s dissolution in 1539, there were only 10 monks in residence. However, it was still one of the richer abbeys in the country, being assessed at £466 in the Valor Ecclesiasticus survey of 1535.

===Dissolution===
The last Abbot, Gabriel Donne (d.1558), surrendered the abbey on 25 February 1539 to Sir William Petre, acting as agent for King Henry VIII. At the time of dissolution there were nine other monks in residence. On 26 April 1539 Gabriel was granted an annual pension of £120. The other monks, who all co-signed the deed of surrender, received smaller pensions.

After the dissolution 1.5 tons of gold, gilt and silver was taken from the abbey to the Tower of London. The site was granted to the King who later granted it to others, including William Petre, the Secretary of State, and Sir Thomas Denys (c.1477–1561) of Holcombe Burnell in Devon. Denys had married Donne&#x27;s sister Elizabeth and was Chamberlain of the Household to Cardinal Wolsey.

===After dissolution===
Following dissolution, the abbey site and its lands were granted by the crown to Sir Thomas Denys (c.1477–1561) of Holcombe Burnell, near Exeter, who stripped the buildings and &quot;reduced them to ruins&quot;. The abbey site was subsequently used as a stone quarry.

In 1800, the site was purchased by local mill owner, Samuel Berry. Berry had the ruins demolished, constructing a Gothic style &quot;castellated Tudor&quot; mansion house, and a wool mill on the site in 1806. The Gothic house was constructed on the site of the abbey&#x27;s former west cloister. The only pieces of the former abbey to escape demolition were some of the outer buildings – which were retained as farm buildings – and the tower from the former abbot&#x27;s lodgings.

Over the next eighty years, the Buckfast site changed hands four times, finally falling into the hands of Dr. James Gale in 1872. Ten years later, Dr. Gale decided to sell the property, but was keen to offer it to a religious community. An advert was placed in The Tablet, describing the Abbey as &quot;a grand acquisition could it be restored to its original purpose.&quot; Within six weeks of the sale, monks were again living at the abbey.

===Reconstruction===
In 1880 the was suppressed under a new French law and some of the monks went to St. Augustine&#x27;s Priory in Ramsgate. The community of Ramsgate gave the French monks use of a property it owned in Leopardstown, Ireland. Learning that the property at Ramsgate was for sale, in 1882 &quot;the whole site was purchased&quot; by the French Benedictine monks for £4,700. On 28 October 1882, six Benedictine monks arrived at Buckfast.

Most of Samuel Berry&#x27;s house was remodelled and incorporated into new claustral ranges which were begun in 1882. A temporary church was constructed to the south of these new buildings, with the current abbey church constructed between 1906 and 1938, mostly on the footprint of the Cistercian Abbey. The east-end does not follow the original plan. The new abbey church was built in the &quot;Norman Transitional and Early English&quot; styles, to the designs of architect Frederick Arthur Walters. There were never more than six monks working on the project at any one time, although the whole community had repaired the ancient foundations up to ground level.

Construction methods were primitive: wooden scaffolding was held together by ropes and no safety protection was worn by the monks. One monk fell 50 feet but survived. Three monks fell off a hoist without serious injury in 1931. Construction continued throughout World War I: some of the monks were of German nationality, but were not sent to an internment camp on condition that they remained confined to the Abbey grounds.

Buckfast was formally reinstated as an Abbey in 1902. Boniface Natter was blessed as the new abbot on 24 February 1903. Boniface Natter died at sea in 1906, when the SS &quot;Sirio&quot; was shipwrecked. His travelling companion Anscar Vonier became the next abbot and pledged to fulfill Natter&#x27;s dying wish, to rebuild the abbey.

The only portion of the medieval claustral buildings which survives is the &quot;much restored&quot;, former abbot&#x27;s tower, which dates from 14th or 15th century. This was incorporated into the abbey&#x27;s guesthouse, which was constructed between 1982 and 1994, when the abbey&#x27;s precinct was rebuilt.
The abbey&#x27;s former well, which was located in the crypt of the former abbey and which may have dated from Saxon times, was destroyed when the new abbey was built. 

====The final phase====

The Abbey Church was consecrated on 25 August 1932, after most of the building had been completed. Construction of the tower was completed in July 1937, with painting completed in December. In 1968, Dom Charles Norris completed the east window in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, using the dalle de verre technique where coloured-glass tiles are shaped and formed into mosaics bound with resin.
Buckfast receives many visitors. Men are lodged in the guest house belonging to the monastery, and men and women in a restored building. Various tours are offered at the site. The hair shirt of Roman Catholic Saint Thomas More is now preserved at a side altar in the Abbey. In 2017, pipe organs were installed inside the Abbey church.

==The grounds==

There is a conference and seminar centre, and a restaurant, the Grange. On the west side of the Abbey are two gardens, with plants ranging from herbs used in cooking or medicine to poisonous plants. Behind the public area is an enclosed garden for the monks. A bridge leads over the river to the abbey farm.

=== Buildings ===
The main building is the large cruciform church of 1906-38, dedicated to St Mary. Its style largely revives that of the late 12th century. This would be similar to the style of the original abbey, as depicted in the Buck Brothers&#x27; 1734 engraving. However, some features, like the tower, the use of vaulting throughout and the triforium, are more elaborate than the original church. Furthermore, the Blessed Sacrament chapel added to the east of the church in 1968 is in a more modern style. To the south of the church are the domestic buildings. These are arrayed around a central cloister, with the refectory in the south range and the monks&#x27; cells on the upper floors in the traditional manner. However, there are some discrepancies from the usual plan due to the incorporation of the medieval abbot&#x27;s tower and the 19th century country house. For example, the chapter house is in a wing in the south-west corner, instead of in its usual position in the east range. The monastic buildings are in a similar style to the church.

The core of the abbey still sits within a walled precinct, with medieval gates to the north and south, and a modern one to the west (built in 1984). To the west of the church is a large 14th century range which now houses the bookshop, but was originally the guest hall. It was twice its present height and width, but was reduced in size following the Dissolution. At right angles to it is a smaller 16th century range, which is better preserved, with an original roof. Next door is a small Methodist chapel, an unlikely bedfellow with the Catholic abbey, which was built in 1881, the year before the monks returned. Adjoining the Northgate is the Grange, built in 1990 as a restaurant and tearooms.

==Self sufficiency==
The Abbey is self-supporting, with a farm where vegetables are grown and bees, pigs and cattle are kept, a shop which sells wine, honey beeswax, fudge and other items made by religious communities throughout the world, and a gift shop, book shop, and restaurant.

===Buckfast Tonic Wine===
The monastery&#x27;s most successful product is Buckfast Tonic Wine, a fortified wine which the monks began making in the 1890s. In 1927, the Abbey lost its licence to sell wine and as a result, the Abbot allowed wine merchants to distribute on behalf of the Abbey. At the same time, the recipe was changed to be less of a patent medicine and more of a medicated wine.

Its perceived links to violent anti-social behaviour – especially in Scotland – have been a controversial issue for the abbey which has employed a youth worker in one area affected.

Following a decision by Police Scotland to attach anti-crime labels to bottles in some areas, the distributor for Great Britain, J Chandler and Co. announced its intention to pursue legal action.

===Beekeeping===

Brother Adam, born Karl Kehrle in 1898 in Germany, died in 1996, was put in charge of the Abbey&#x27;s beekeeping in 1919, and began extensive breeding work creating the honeybee now known as the Buckfast bee. Brother Adam had to replenish the bee colonies, as 30 of the monastery&#x27;s 46 colonies had been wiped out by a disease known at the time as the Isle of Wight Disease, but later called Acarine. All the bees that died were of the Old British Black bee, a now extinct British strain of the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;.

The 16 hives that survived were descended from &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot; queens from the Ligurian Alps region of Italy. At the request of the government, Brother Adam helped in restocking the British Isles with his disease resistant Buckfast bees. Today the breeding of pedigree Buckfast bees is regulated by the &quot;Federation of European Buckfast Beekeepers&quot; (G.D.E.B.) in over twenty-six countries with numerous breeders.

Buckfast bees are no longer kept at the Abbey. Instead of commercial beekeeping with nearly 400 hives, today the focus at the Abbey&#x27;s apiary is educational such as beekeeping courses, workshops, and honeybee experience days with their 4 hives.

==Schools==

===Buckfast Abbey Preparatory School===
From 1967 until 1994, the abbey ran a prep school for boys and girls aged 7 to 13, but was obliged to close it as the school became financially non-viable due to dwindling numbers of boarders. Two former monks were later convicted and imprisoned for sexually abusing boys during this period.

===St Boniface&#x27;s Catholic College===
With the outbreak of World War II, Plymouth-based St Boniface&#x27;s Catholic College evacuated its pupils to Buckfast Abbey between 1941 and 1945. The school later named one of its Houses &quot;Abbey&quot; in memory of this period in their history.

===School of the Annunciation===
The School of the Annunciation was a place of learning for adults and was a charitable company based in the grounds of Buckfast Abbey. It was founded in 2014 by Dr Petroc Willey, Dr Andrew Beards, and Dr Caroline Farey, who had left the Maryvale Institute, with the Abbot of Buckfast. It offered distance learning, part-time programmes, summer schools and short courses in theology, philosophy, catechetics, sacred beauty, liturgy and other associated subjects to support the New Evangelisation. The School closed in August 2019 due to a lack of funding.

==Music==
The current Master of the Music is Matthew Searles.

=== Choirs ===
The present incarnation of the Abbey Choir was founded in 2009. The choir sings Solemn Mass and Vespers on Sundays, and Mass on Holy Days of Obligation during the week. The choir sings a broad liturgical repertoire, ranging from polyphonic music of the sixteenth century and Masses of the Viennese school, through to music of the French Romantic tradition and contemporary music by James MacMillian, Matthew Martin and Dom Sebastian Wolff OSB. In 2018 the choir sang Christmas Midnight Mass, which was televised live on BBC One. The choir gives several concert performances each year, and in 2024 this included the premiere of a new Mass for Corpus Christi composed by Martin Baker.

Alongside the Abbey Choir, there is also a line of trebles recruited from local schools. Established in 2018, the Abbey Choristers sing alongside members of the Abbey Choir at the Conventual Mass on Thursdays and some Saturdays during school term time. They also perform in the area and on an annual summer tour. 

=== Organ ===
The Abbey has an organ by the Italian organ builder, Fratelli Ruffati, the first to be constructed in the UK. The organ was installed in 2017 and given its inaugural recital in 2018. The instrument consists of a substantial Quire Organ (four divisions and pedal) located on both sides of the Quire and the upper triforium, and a Grand-Orgue in the West Gallery (two divisions and pedal). The two spatially-separated instruments can by played antiphonally or together from one or both of the two consoles in the church. The organ contains 5,537 pipes and features a striking Pontifical Trumpet &quot;en chamade&quot;, which protrudes horizontally from the West Gallery casework. 

The organ by Ruffati replaced a previous Hele/Walker instrument, the basis of which was installed in 1922 and later added to in successive changes. Important changes to the stop list were made by Ralph Downes, who also rescaled and revoiced the existing pipework in the 1940s and 1950s.

=== Ad Fontes ===
Ad Fontes is a record label founded by Buckfast Abbey dedicated to presenting recordings of sacred music. As well as featuring the Abbey&#x27;s own choirs and organists, the label collaborates with external soloists and choirs to produce recordings of music from the Catholic tradition, a notable example of this being The Choir of Westminster Cathedral.

=== Bells ===
The tower contains fifteen bells. There is a ring of twelve bells, with a tenor weighing 41 long hundredweight (with two extra semi tone bells) surrounding the 7.5 ton bourdon bell called Hosanna. In August 2018, the Abbey hosted the Millennium Bell Ringing Festival in celebration of its 1000th year since the foundation of the monastery.

The bells were cast in 1935 by John Taylor and Co. and were donated by a local benefactor, Sir Robert Harvey. They are hung in the traditional change ringing style, and have an Ellacombe chiming apparatus for single-handed ringing, though this is currently out of use.

<text>Wilfrid Wilson Gibson (2 October 1878 – 26 May 1962) was a British Georgian poet, who was associated with World War I but continued publishing poetry into the 1940s and 1950s.

==Early work==

Gibson was born in Hexham, Northumberland. His parents were Elizabeth Judith Frances (born Walton) and John Pattison Gibson. Her father was a chemist who was interested in photography and antiquarianism. His elder sister Elizabeth, who became his teacher and mentor, also became a published poet. He left the north for London in 1914 after his mother died. He had been publishing poems in magazines since 1895, and his first collections in book form were published by Elkin Mathews in 1902. His collections of verse plays and dramatic poems &quot;The Stonefolds&quot; and &quot;On The Threshold&quot; were published by the Samurai Press (of Cranleigh) in 1907, followed next year by the book of poems, &quot;The Web of Life&quot;.

Despite his residence in London, and later in Gloucestershire, many of Gibson&#x27;s poems both then and later, have Northumberland settings: &quot;Hexham&#x27;s Market Cross&quot;; &quot;Hareshaw&quot;; and &quot;The Kielder Stone&quot;. Others deal with poverty and passion amid wild Northumbrian landscapes. Still others are devoted to fishermen, industrial workers and miners, often alluding to local ballads and the rich folk-song heritage of the North East.

In London, he met both Edward Marsh and Rupert Brooke, becoming a close friend and later Brooke&#x27;s literary executor (with Lascelles Abercrombie and Walter de la Mare). This was at the period when the first &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; anthology was being hatched. Gibson was one of the insiders.

During the early part of his writing life, Wilfrid Wilson Gibson wrote poems that featured the &quot;macabre&quot;. One such poem is &quot;Flannan Isle&quot;, based on a real-life mystery.

Gibson was one of the founders of the Dymock poets, a group of writers who lived in and around the village of Dymock, on the Gloucestershire/Herefordshire border, in the years immediately before the outbreak of the First World War.
Gibson also published plays, as well as several prose works. For instance, he wrote and argued beautifully about the merit of verse at the time of World War II. He wrote a piece of criticism on &quot;Italian Nationalism and English Letters&quot; by Harry W. Rudman regarding the contributions made by Italian exiles in England to English literature, which were in the form of poetry by and large. He also wrote criticism on &quot;The Burning Oracle: Studies in the Poetry of Action&quot; by G. Wilson Knight, wherein he commends the fact that Knight sees the creative energy of living writers not only in the creation of artworks, but also in the creation of life itself.

==Death and reputation==
Gibson died on 26 May 1962, in Virginia Water, Surrey.

His reputation was eclipsed somewhat by the Ezra Pound-T. S. Eliot school of Modernist poetry, though his work remained popular.

<text>Julian Henry Francis Grenfell (30 March 1888 – 26 May 1915) was a British soldier and a war poet of World War I.

==Early life==
Julian Grenfell was born at 4 St James&#x27;s Square, London, the eldest son of William Grenfell, later Baron Desborough, and Ethel Priscilla Fane, daughter of Julian Fane.

He was educated at Eton where he was good friends with Denys Finch Hatton, Edward Horner, and latterly with Patrick Shaw-Stewart. From Eton he went up to Balliol College, Oxford, where he soon developed a reputation for bullying and rowdy behaviour, such as cracking a stock whip within inches of Philip Sassoon&#x27;s head. In his final year at Oxford Grenfell began to struggle with his studies, his moods became unstable, and he was anxious, agitated and miserable. His friends and family found it hard to understand what was wrong, but to modern eyes he was clearly suffering from a recurrent major depressive illness. After consulting with his college and his parents Grenfell opted to take a pass degree, as he was not well enough to continue with his honours course After University Julian spent much of his time involved in outdoor activities; hunting and fishing, and as a somewhat reluctant participant in his mother&#x27;s high society parties, and country house weekends. It was at one such gathering that Julian met Marjory Manners, daughter of the Duke of Rutland, to whom he became devoted. They corresponded for a lengthy period, and Marjory was one of the first to write to Julian&#x27;s mother Ettie, after his death to tell of her anguish.

==Military service==
Grenfell was commissioned in the British Army in 1907 and eventually attached to the 1st (Royal) Dragoons in 1910. He was initially sent out to India, where he enjoyed the big game hunting but found military service tedious and his fellow officers rather dull. He then moved with his regiment to South Africa, which Julian greatly disliked (he described South Africa as a landscape of endless scrubland dotted with tin huts, and no trees). By the summer of 1914 he was writing to his mother seeking her help to get him out of the army and back to Britain, having decided to move to a career in politics. When war broke out in August his regiment returned to the U.K. and were sent to Salisbury Plain for intensive training prior to deployment to the western front. It quickly became clear that the conflict had become bogged down in static trench warfare, with little or no role for the cavalry. Julian&#x27;s unit became de facto infantry soldiers, and despite all the discomforts and dangers he continued to write upbeat letters to his family and friends. Julian became aware that lives were being regularly lost to German snipers. Using hunting skills he had developed at Panshanger, Julian taught his men how to crawl through no-mans land unseen, &quot;steering by the stars&quot; to attack the German front line trenches, and gain intelligence.

For this, he was awarded a Distinguished Service Order in the 1915 New Year Honours;

On 13 May 1915 as a captain in the 1st (Royal) Dragoons, Grenfell stood talking with a General Campbell. A shell landed a few yards from them, injuring both men. The general was able to help Julian to the nearest aid post, where he was initially so cheerful that everyone thought he had only a minor wound. When he (presciently) said &quot;I think I shall die&quot; his friends objected, but Julian insisted &quot;you see if I don&#x27;t&quot;. He was taken to a hospital at Wimereux, where his sister Monica was working as a V.A.D. nurse. He initially seemed to be holding his own, but a X-Ray showed he had an extensive skull fracture, and underlying brain injury. He was operated on at once, but on 23 May the doctors found his wound was infected so a second operation was undertaken. After this he was in continuous pain, and began to deteriorate. One of his arms gradually became paralysed, and he became increasingly drowsy. For ten long hot days his mother and father sat by his bedside, while Julian remembered happier times in younger years at Taplow Court with his mother, and recited poetry, particularly his favourite, the ancient Greek tragedy &quot;Hippolytus&quot; by Euripides. He died from encephalitis on the afternoon of 26 May with his mother, father and sister at his bedside. He was 27 years old and was buried at the Boulogne Eastern Cemetery; his mother covered his grave with oak leaves and wild flowers sent by his younger sister from home. The day after his death, together with news of his death, his most famous poem &quot;Into Battle&quot; was published for the first time, in &quot;The Times&quot;.

In a letter from October 1914, Grenfell had written &quot;I adore war. ... It is like a big picnic but without the objectivelessness of a picnic. I have never been more well or more happy. ... It just suits my stolid health and stolid nerves and barbaric disposition. The fighting-excitement vitalizes everything, every sight and action. One loves one&#x27;s fellow man so much more when one is bent on killing him.&quot; This contrasts sharply with the work of later war poets such as Siegfried Sassoon or Wilfred Owen, but it should be remembered that Grenfell was a professional soldier; in any event, many British veterans of the war later rejected the idea that Sassoon and Owen spoke for them. Historian Max Hastings says of Grenfell that he was &quot;idolised by his peers for reasons mystifying to posterity.&quot;

His younger brother the Honourable Gerald William (Billy) Grenfell was killed in action on 30 July 1915, within a mile of where Julian had previously been fatally wounded. The death of both Julian and Billy was a dreadful blow to their mother Lady (Ethel) &quot;Ettie&quot; Desborough, who was haunted by bereavement for the rest of her life. Tragically her 3rd remaining son, Ivo, was killed from a head injury sustained in a motor accident, and he died in circumstances very similar to Julian&#x27;s death.

==Commemoration==
On 11 November 1985, Grenfell was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poets&#x27; Corner. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to his poems and reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot;

Today Grenfell is most remembered for his poem &quot;Into Battle&quot; written in May 1915, the closing lines read;

&quot;The thundering line of battle stands,
And in the air Death moans and sings;
But Day shall clasp him with strong hands,
And Night shall fold him in soft wings.&quot;

<text>Captain Charles Hamilton Sorley (19 May 1895 – 13 October 1915) was a British Army officer and Scottish war poet who fought in the First World War. He was killed in action during the Battle of Loos in October 1915.

==Life and work==
Born in Powis House Aberdeen, Scotland, he was the son of philosopher and University Professor William Ritchie Sorley. He was educated at King&#x27;s College School, Cambridge, and then like Siegfried Sassoon, at Marlborough College (1908–13). At Marlborough College Sorley&#x27;s favourite pursuit was cross-country running in the rain, a theme evident in many of his pre-war poems, including &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;The Song of the Ungirt Runners&quot;. In keeping with his strict Protestant upbringing, Sorley had strong views on right and wrong, and on two occasions volunteered to be punished for breaking school rules.

Before taking up a scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, Sorley spent a little more than six months in Germany from January to July 1914, three months of which were at Schwerin studying the language and local culture. Then he enrolled at the University of Jena, and studied there up to the outbreak of World War I.

After Germany declared war on Russia, Sorley was detained for an afternoon in Trier, but was released on the same day and told to leave the country. He returned to England and immediately volunteered for military service in the British Army. He joined the Suffolk Regiment as a second lieutenant and was posted to the 7th (Service) Battalion, a Kitchener&#x27;s Army unit serving as part of the 35th Brigade of the 12th (Eastern) Division. He arrived on the Western Front in Boulogne, France on 30 May 1915 as a lieutenant, and served near Ploegsteert. He was promoted to captain in August 1915.

Sorley was killed in action near Hulluch, having been shot in the head by a sniper during the final offensive of the Battle of Loos on 13 October 1915. Having no known grave at war&#x27;s end, he is commemorated on the CWGC Loos Memorial.

Sorley&#x27;s last poem was recovered from his kit after his death, and includes some of his most famous lines:

:&quot;When you see millions of the mouthless dead&quot;
:&quot;Across your dreams in pale battalions go&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Marlborough and Other Poems&quot; was published posthumously in January 1916 and immediately became a critical success, with six editions printed that year. His &quot;Collected Letters&quot;, edited by his parents, were published in 1919.

Robert Graves, a contemporary of Sorley&#x27;s, described him in his book &quot;Goodbye to All That&quot; as &quot;one of the three poets of importance killed during the war&quot;. (The other two were Isaac Rosenberg and Wilfred Owen.) Sorley may be seen as a forerunner of Sassoon and Owen, and his unsentimental style stands in direct contrast to that of Rupert Brooke.

The last two stanzas of his poem &quot;Expectans expectavi&quot; were set to music in 1919 by Charles Wood; this anthem for choir and organ quickly established itself in the standard repertoire of Anglican cathedrals and collegiate churches.

Sorley is regarded by some, including the Poet Laureate John Masefield (1878–1967), as the greatest loss of all the poets killed during the war.

On 11 November 1985, Sorley was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poet&#x27;s Corner. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to his poems and reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot;

&quot;It Is Easy To Be Dead&quot; by Neil McPherson, a play on his life, based on his poetry and letters, was presented at the Finborough Theatre, London, and subsequently at Trafalgar Studios, London, in 2016 where it was nominated for an Olivier Award. It subsequently toured to Glasgow and Sorley&#x27;s birthplace, Aberdeen, in 2018.

On 9 November 2018, an opinion commentary by Aaron Schnoor published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; honored the poetry of World War I, including Sorley&#x27;s poem &quot;When You See Millions of the Mouthless Dead&quot;.

<text>Sir James Tyrrell (c. 1455 – 6 May 1502) was an English knight, a trusted servant of king Richard III of England. He is known for allegedly confessing to the murders of the Princes in the Tower under Richard&#x27;s orders. In his 1593 play &quot;Richard III&quot;, William Shakespeare portrays Tyrrell as the man who organises the princes murders.

==Family==
James Tyrrell was the eldest son of William Tyrrell of Gipping in Suffolk, and Margaret Darcy, the daughter of Robert Darcy of Maldon, and the grandson of Sir John Tyrrell.

==Career==
Tyrrell&#x27;s father was beheaded on Tower Hill on 23 February 1462, together with Sir Thomas Tuddenham and John Montgomery. John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, and his eldest son and heir, Aubrey, were beheaded on 26 February and 20 February, respectively, after the discovery of an alleged plot to murder Edward IV. No records of the trials of the alleged conspirators have survived to shed light on what part, if any, Tyrrell&#x27;s father played in the alleged conspiracy. He was not attainted, and his eldest son and heir&#x27;s wardship and the custody of his lands were granted to Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, who sold them to William Tyrrell&#x27;s widow in March 1463 for £50.

James Tyrrell fought on the Yorkist side at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471, and was knighted there by Edward IV. A few months later he entered the service of the future Richard III, then Duke of Gloucester. After Richard III assumed power, he was appointed High Sheriff of Cornwall in 1484. He was in France in 1485, and played no part in the Battle of Bosworth Field which signalled the end of the Yorkists and the start of the Tudor dynasty.
He returned to England in 1486 and was pardoned by King Henry VII on 16 June, and was pardoned again on 16 July. Sir Clements Markham considers that it was between these dates that the murder of the princes took place – although Sir Clements has frequently been criticised for his lack of scholarly rigour and accuracy. Henry VII reappointed him governor of Guînes (in the English possession of Calais) in 1486. Tyrrell had previously been granted the Lieutenancy of Guines on 22 January 1485 by Richard III (vellum document and Great Seal now owned by Richard III Society in UK). However, in 1501, Tyrrell lent his support to Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk, now the leading Yorkist claimant to the English throne, who was in voluntary exile. In the spring of 1501 Henry VII sent Thomas Lovell to Guînes to arrest Tyrrell and others, including Tyrrell&#x27;s son, Thomas.

Tyrrell was charged with treason, was tried and convicted at the Guildhall in London on 2 May 1502 and executed four days later, on 6 May, together with one of his accomplices in aiding Suffolk, Sir John Wyndham. Tyrrell was buried at the church of the Austin Friars, London. He was attainted on 25 January 1504; however the attainder was reversed three years later, on 19 April 1507.

===Princes in the Tower===
Some years after Tyrrell&#x27;s execution, Sir Thomas More claimed in his &quot;History of King Richard III&quot; that during his examination Tyrrell confessed to the murders of King Edward V of England and his brother Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York. According to More, he also implicated John Dighton as a perpetrator, and Dighton when questioned corroborated Tyrrell&#x27;s account. But he was unable to say where the bodies were, claiming that they had been moved. The original document of Tyrrell&#x27;s alleged confession was never produced. However, other contemporary accounts, notably that of Polydore Vergil, make no mention of the confession. Additionally, if the confession was ever made, it was likely gathered during or after torture.

Elizabethan chronicles developed More&#x27;s narrative of Tyrrell and the Princes in the Tower. Richard III gave James Tyrrell and Sir Thomas Tyrell (of &quot;brethren of blood&quot;) the keys to the Tower. James Tyrell &quot;devised that they should be murthered in their beds&quot;, and appointed Miles Forrest and John Dighton to smother them. Tyrell, according to the chronicles, supervised the burials &quot;at the stayre foote, metely deepe in the ground under a great heape of stones&quot;. Tyrell reported the burial to Richard III, who ordered that they be buried secretly in another place. Forrest &quot;miserably rotted away&quot; at St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand and Dighton lived in &quot;great misery&quot; at Calais.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1469, Tyrrell married Anne Arundel, the daughter of John Arundel of Lanherne, by his first wife, Elizabeth Morley, daughter of Thomas, Lord Morley, by whom he had three sons and a daughter:

*Sir Thomas Tyrrell (d. 1551) of Gipping, who married Margaret Willoughby, daughter of Christopher Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, by whom he had a son, Sir John Tyrrell (d. 1574), who married Elizabeth Munday, the daughter of Sir John Munday (d. 1537), Lord Mayor of London, and a daughter, Anne Tyrrell, who married Sir John Clere of Ormesby.
*James Tyrrell (d. 1539) of Columbine Hall in Stowupland, who married Anne Hotoft.
*William Tyrrell.
*Anne Tyrrell, who married Sir Richard Wentworth (d. 1528) of Nettlestead, by whom she was the mother of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Baron Wentworth.

==Further discussion==
In a television programme first broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on 21 March 2015, the historian David Starkey announced his discovery in royal records that both Henry VII and his wife Elizabeth, the sister of Edward V and Richard Duke of York, were present throughout Tyrrell&#x27;s trial.

However, contemporary documents originally retrieved by scholar Rosemary Horrox record that the king and queen were lodged in the Royal Apartments at the Tower during Tyrrell&#x27;s trial, which was not held at the Tower itself.

In his 1593 play &quot;Richard III&quot;, William Shakespeare portrays Tyrrell as the man who organises the princes&#x27; murders.

In 2024, Professor Tim Thornton of the University of Huddersfield contended that a chain belonging to Edward V mentioned in the will of Margaret Capel, Tyrrell&#x27;s sister-in-law, was a chain of office, and supported claims that Tyrrell was involved in the murder.

<doc id="105834" wikidata="Q1287021" url="?curid=105834" title="Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk">
<text>Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk, 6th Earl of Suffolk, (c. 147130 April 1513), Duke of Suffolk, was an English nobleman and soldier. The son of John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk and his wife Elizabeth of York, he was through his mother the nephew of the Yorkist kings of England Edward IV and Richard III and the cousin of Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York (the Princes in the Tower) and of Henry VII&#x27;s queen Elizabeth of York.

Although the male York line ended with the death of Edward Plantagenet and the Poles at first swore loyalty to the Tudor king of England, they later tried to claim the throne as the Yorkist claimants in the maternal line. Edmund was ultimately executed at the Tower of London.

==Yorkist claim==

Edmund de la Pole was a son of John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk, and Elizabeth of York. His mother was the second surviving daughter of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville. She was also a younger sister to King Edward IV and older sister to Richard III.

==Service to the Tudors==
De la Pole&#x27;s eldest brother John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln (c. 14641487), was the designated heir of their maternal uncle Richard III, who gave him a pension and the reversion of the estates of Lady Margaret Beaufort. Meanwhile, Edmund was made a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Richard III, and was present at the coronation of his cousin Elizabeth of York in 1487. Following the Battle of Bosworth Field, Lincoln took the oath of allegiance to Elizabeth&#x27;s husband, Henry VII, instead of claiming the throne for himself. In 1487, Lincoln joined the rebellion of Lambert Simnel and was killed at the Battle of Stoke.

After the death of his older brother, Edmund became the leading Yorkist claimant to the throne, and succeeded to the title Duke of Suffolk in 1492. Edmund took part in the Siege of Boulogne in October 1492. However, he is said to have subsequently agreed with King Henry VII, by Indenture dated 26 February 1492/3, to surrender the dukedom (with, apparently, the marquessate) of Suffolk, and to be known henceforth as the Earl of Suffolk only, this being ratified by Act of Parliament in 1495. In consideration of this surrender and &quot;of the true and diligent service done to his Highness by the said Edmund&quot; the King granted to him, for £5,000, a portion of the lands forfeited by his elder brother John, Earl of Lincoln, in 1487.

Suffolk was one of the leaders against the Cornish rebels at Blackheath, 17 June 1497. However, in Michaelmas term 1498 he was indicted for murder in the King&#x27;s Bench and, though afterwards pardoned, he fled overseas to Guisnes, July 1499, returning to England after September. He was at this time recorded as stout and bold and of courage. On 5 May 1500 he witnessed at Canterbury the treaty for the marriage of King Henry and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s son Prince Arthur with Catherine of Aragon. He then left for France, arriving there on the 13th, and attended the King at his meeting with Archduke Philip at Calais, on 9 June 1500.

==Yorkist claimant==
In August 1501 he and his brother Richard again left England without royal leave (apparently assisted by James Tyrrell, who was subsequently executed for these actions), and joining Emperor Maximilian I in the Tyrol, he assumed his former title of Duke of Suffolk, being also known as the &quot;White Rose&quot; (Yorkist Pretender). For his alleged projected rebellion he was proclaimed an outlaw at Ipswich, 26 December 1502, and with his brothers William (arrested on suspicion and sent to the Tower, which he never left, early in 1502) and Richard, was attainted in Parliament January 1503/4, whereby all his honours were forfeited, backdated to 1 July 1499. Seward relates that throughout this period until Edmund&#x27;s death he used a Thomas Killingworth, gentleman of East Anglia and London, as his Steward, for which Killingworth later received a Royal Pardon.

On 28 July 1502 Maximilian signed a treaty at Augsburg whereby, in return for £10,000, he undertook not to help the English rebels. Nevertheless, Suffolk was allowed to remain at Aix, 1502–04, though on leaving he had to leave his brother Richard as hostage for his debts. Upon leaving Aix about April 1504 in an attempt to join the Duke of Saxony in Friesland, he was imprisoned by the Duke of Guelders at Hattem and subsequently by Archduke Philip of Burgundy, at Namur into 1506.

==Imprisonment and execution==
While sailing to Spain to secure his wife Joanna&#x27;s inheritance of the Crown of Castile, Philip I of Castile was blown off course to England, and reluctantly and unexpectedly became a guest of Henry VII. Needing to continue his journey, Philip was persuaded by Henry to hand over the Earl of Suffolk in the treaty &quot;Malus Intercursus&quot;. Henry committed the Earl to the Tower on his arrival in London, late in March 1505/6.

On the accession of Henry VII and Elizabeth&#x27;s son Henry VIII, Edmund being still in the Tower, was (with his two brothers) excepted from the new king&#x27;s general pardon of 30 April 1509. After being a prisoner in the Tower for 7 years, he was (since his brother Richard had joined the service of France, with whom England was then at war), without any further proceedings, beheaded on Tower Hill aged about 42.

Montaigne, in his &quot;Essays&quot;, said that Henry VII, in his will, instructed his son to put Suffolk to death immediately after his own death, and the author criticized the father for requiring that his son do what he himself would not.

==Marriage and heirs==
Edmund married, before 10 October 1496, Margaret, daughter of Sir Richard Scrope, Knt., second son of Henry Scrope, 4th Baron Scrope of Bolton. Margaret died in 1515. They had a daughter, Elizabeth, who became a nun and died of the Black Plague in the Convent of the Minoresses without Aldgate, London, in 1515.

Edmund&#x27;s younger brother, Richard de la Pole, declared himself Earl of Suffolk and was the leading Yorkist pretender until his death at the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525.

==Popular culture==
Edmund is portrayed by Nick Barber in the 2019 Starz miniseries &quot;The Spanish Princess&quot;.

<doc id="105836" wikidata="Q16670987" url="?curid=105836" title="Oncotic pressure">
<text>Oncotic pressure, or colloid osmotic-pressure, is a type of osmotic pressure induced by the plasma proteins, notably albumin, in a blood vessel&#x27;s plasma (or any other body fluid such as blood and lymph) that causes a pull on fluid back into the capillary.

It has an effect opposing both the hydrostatic blood pressure, which pushes water and small molecules out of the blood into the interstitial spaces at the arterial end of capillaries, and the interstitial colloidal osmotic pressure. These interacting factors determine the partitioning of extracellular water between the blood plasma and the extravascular space.

Oncotic pressure strongly affects the physiological function of the circulatory system. It is suspected to have a major effect on the pressure across the glomerular filter. However, this concept has been strongly criticised and attention has shifted to the impact of the intravascular glycocalyx layer as the major player.

== Etymology ==
The word &#x27;oncotic&#x27; by definition is termed as &#x27;pertaining to swelling&#x27;, indicating the effect of oncotic imbalance on the swelling of tissues.

The word itself is derived from onco- and -ic; &#x27;onco-&#x27; meaning &#x27;pertaining to mass or tumors&#x27; and &#x27;-ic&#x27;, which forms an adjective.

==Description==
Throughout the body, dissolved compounds have an osmotic pressure. Because large plasma proteins cannot easily cross through the capillary walls, their effect on the osmotic pressure of the capillary interiors will, to some extent, balance out the tendency for fluid to leak out of the capillaries. In other words, the oncotic pressure tends to pull fluid into the capillaries. In conditions where plasma proteins are reduced, e.g. from being lost in the urine (proteinuria), there will be a reduction in oncotic pressure and an increase in filtration across the capillary, resulting in excess fluid buildup in the tissues (edema).

The large majority of oncotic pressure in capillaries is generated by the presence of high quantities of albumin, a protein that constitutes approximately 80% of the total oncotic pressure exerted by blood plasma on interstitial fluid . The total oncotic pressure of an average capillary is about 28 mmHg with albumin contributing approximately 22 mmHg of this oncotic pressure, despite only representing 50% of all protein in blood plasma at 35-50 g/L. Because blood proteins cannot escape through capillary endothelium, oncotic pressure of capillary beds tends to draw water into the vessels. It is necessary to understand the oncotic pressure as a balance; because the blood proteins reduce interior permeability, less plasma fluid can exit the vessel.

Oncotic pressure is represented by the symbol Π or π in the Starling equation and elsewhere. The Starling equation in particular describes filtration in volume/s (formula_1) by relating oncotic pressure (formula_2) to capillary hydrostatic pressure (formula_3), interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (formula_4), and interstitial fluid oncotic pressure (formula_5), as well as several descriptive coefficients, as shown below:

formula_6

At the arteriolar end of the capillary, blood pressure starts at about 36 mm Hg and decreases to around 15 mm Hg at the venous end, with oncotic pressure at a stable 25–28 mm Hg. Within the capillary, reabsorption due to this venous pressure difference is estimated to be around 90% that of the filtered fluid, with the extra 10% being returned via lymphatics in order to maintain stable blood volume.

==Physiological impact==
In tissues, physiological disruption can arise with decreased oncotic pressure, which can be determined using blood tests for protein concentration.

Decreased colloidal osmotic pressure, most notably seen in hypoalbuminemia, can cause edema and decrease in blood volume as fluid is not reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Colloid pressure in these cases can be lost due to a number of different factors, but primarily decreased colloid production or increased loss of colloids through glomerular filtration. This low pressure often correlates with poor surgical outcomes.

In the clinical setting, there are two types of fluids that are used for intravenous drips: crystalloids and colloids. Crystalloids are aqueous solutions of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules. Colloids contain larger insoluble molecules, such as gelatin. There is some debate concerning the advantages and disadvantages of using biological vs. synthetic colloid solutions. Oncotic pressure values are approximately 290 mOsm per kg of water, which slightly differs from the osmotic pressure of the blood that has values approximating 300 mOsm /L. These colloidal solutions are typically used to remedy low colloid concentration, such as in hypoalbuminemia, but is also suspected to assist in injuries that typically increase fluid loss, such as burns.

<doc id="105837" wikidata="Q1051282" url="?curid=105837" title="Generic programming">
<text>Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written in terms of data types &quot;to-be-specified-later&quot; that are then &quot;instantiated&quot; when needed for specific types provided as parameters. This approach, pioneered in the programming language ML in 1973, permits writing common functions or data types that differ only in the set of types on which they operate when used, thus reducing duplicate code.

Generic programming was introduced to the mainstream with Ada in 1977. With templates in C++, generic programming became part of the repertoire of professional library design. The techniques were further improved and &quot;parameterized types&quot; were introduced in the influential 1994 book &quot;Design Patterns&quot;.

New techniques were introduced by Andrei Alexandrescu in his 2001 book &quot;Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied&quot;. Subsequently, D implemented the same ideas.

Such software entities are known as &quot;generics&quot; in Ada, C#, Delphi, Eiffel, F#, Java, Nim, Python, Go, Rust, Swift, TypeScript, and Visual Basic (.NET). They are known as &quot;parametric polymorphism&quot; in ML, Scala, Julia, and Haskell. (Haskell terminology also uses the term &quot;generic&quot; for a related but somewhat different concept.)

The term &quot;generic programming&quot; was originally coined by David Musser and Alexander Stepanov in a more specific sense than the above, to describe a programming paradigm in which fundamental requirements on data types are abstracted from across concrete examples of algorithms and data structures and formalized as concepts, with generic functions implemented in terms of these concepts, typically using language genericity mechanisms as described above.

== Stepanov–Musser and other generic programming paradigms ==
Generic programming is defined in as follows,
The &quot;generic programming&quot; paradigm is an approach to software decomposition whereby fundamental requirements on types are abstracted from across concrete examples of algorithms and data structures and formalized as concepts, analogously to the abstraction of algebraic theories in abstract algebra. Early examples of this programming approach were implemented in Scheme and Ada, although the best known example is the Standard Template Library (STL), which developed a theory of iterators that is used to decouple sequence data structures and the algorithms operating on them.

For example, given &quot;N&quot; sequence data structures, e.g. singly linked list, vector etc., and &quot;M&quot; algorithms to operate on them, e.g. codice_1, codice_2 etc., a direct approach would implement each algorithm specifically for each data structure, giving combinations to implement. However, in the generic programming approach, each data structure returns a model of an iterator concept (a simple value type that can be dereferenced to retrieve the current value, or changed to point to another value in the sequence) and each algorithm is instead written generically with arguments of such iterators, e.g. a pair of iterators pointing to the beginning and end of the subsequence or &quot;range&quot; to process. Thus, only data structure-algorithm combinations need be implemented. Several iterator concepts are specified in the STL, each a refinement of more restrictive concepts e.g. forward iterators only provide movement to the next value in a sequence (e.g. suitable for a singly linked list or a stream of input data), whereas a random-access iterator also provides direct constant-time access to any element of the sequence (e.g. suitable for a vector). An important point is that a data structure will return a model of the most general concept that can be implemented efficiently—computational complexity requirements are explicitly part of the concept definition. This limits the data structures a given algorithm can be applied to and such complexity requirements are a major determinant of data structure choice. Generic programming similarly has been applied in other domains, e.g. graph algorithms.

Although this approach often uses language features of compile-time genericity and templates, it is independent of particular language-technical details. Generic programming pioneer Alexander Stepanov wrote,


Bjarne Stroustrup noted,
Other programming paradigms that have been described as generic programming include &quot;Datatype generic programming&quot; as described in &quot;Generic Programming – an Introduction&quot;. The approach is a lightweight generic programming approach for Haskell.

In this article we distinguish the high-level programming paradigms of &quot;generic programming&quot;, above, from the lower-level programming language &quot;genericity mechanisms&quot; used to implement them (see Programming language support for genericity). For further discussion and comparison of generic programming paradigms, see.

==Programming language support for genericity==
Genericity facilities have existed in high-level languages since at least the 1970s in languages such as ML, CLU and Ada, and were subsequently adopted by many object-based and object-oriented languages, including BETA, C++, D, Eiffel, Java, and DEC&#x27;s now defunct Trellis-Owl.

Genericity is implemented and supported differently in various programming languages; the term &quot;generic&quot; has also been used differently in various programming contexts. For example, in Forth the compiler can execute code while compiling and one can create new &quot;compiler keywords&quot; and new implementations for those words on the fly. It has few &quot;words&quot; that expose the compiler behaviour and therefore naturally offers &quot;genericity&quot; capacities that, however, are not referred to as such in most Forth texts. Similarly, dynamically typed languages, especially interpreted ones, usually offer &quot;genericity&quot; by default as both passing values to functions and value assignment are type-indifferent and such behavior is often used for abstraction or code terseness, however this is not typically labeled &quot;genericity&quot; as it&#x27;s a direct consequence of the dynamic typing system employed by the language. The term has been used in functional programming, specifically in Haskell-like languages, which use a structural type system where types are always parametric and the actual code on those types is generic. These uses still serve a similar purpose of code-saving and rendering an abstraction.

Arrays and structs can be viewed as predefined generic types. Every usage of an array or struct type instantiates a new concrete type, or reuses a previous instantiated type. Array element types and struct element types are parameterized types, which are used to instantiate the corresponding generic type. All this is usually built-in in the compiler and the syntax differs from other generic constructs. Some extensible programming languages try to unify built-in and user defined generic types.

A broad survey of genericity mechanisms in programming languages follows. For a specific survey comparing suitability of mechanisms for generic programming, see.

===In object-oriented languages===
When creating container classes in statically typed languages, it is inconvenient to write specific implementations for each datatype contained, especially if the code for each datatype is virtually identical. For example, in C++, this duplication of code can be circumvented by defining a class template:

template&lt;typename T&gt;
class List {
 // Class contents.

List&lt;Animal&gt; list_of_animals;
List&lt;Car&gt; list_of_cars;

Above, codice_3 is a placeholder for whatever type is specified when the list is created. These &quot;containers-of-type-T&quot;, commonly called templates, allow a class to be reused with different datatypes as long as certain contracts such as subtypes and signature are kept. This genericity mechanism should not be confused with &quot;inclusion polymorphism&quot;, which is the algorithmic usage of exchangeable sub-classes: for instance, a list of objects of type codice_4 containing objects of type codice_5 and codice_6. Templates can also be used for type-independent functions as in the codice_7 example below:
// &quot;&amp;&quot; denotes a reference
template&lt;typename T&gt;
void Swap(T&amp; a, T&amp; b) { // A similar, but safer and potentially faster function 
 // is defined in the standard library header &lt;utility&gt;
 T temp = b;
 b = a;
 a = temp;

std::string world = &quot;World!&quot;;
std::string hello = &quot;Hello, &quot;;
Swap(world, hello);
std::cout « world « hello « ‘\n’; // Output is &quot;Hello, World!&quot;.
The C++ codice_8 construct used above is widely cited as the genericity construct that popularized the notion among programmers and language designers and supports many generic programming idioms. The D language also offers fully generic-capable templates based on the C++ precedent but with a simplified syntax. The Java language has provided genericity facilities syntactically based on C++&#x27;s since the introduction of Java Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 5.0.

C# 2.0, Oxygene 1.5 (formerly Chrome) and Visual Basic (.NET) 2005 have constructs that exploit the support for generics present in Microsoft .NET Framework since version 2.0.

====Generics in Ada====

Ada has had generics since it was first designed in 1977–1980. The standard library uses generics to provide many services. Ada 2005 adds a comprehensive generic container library to the standard library, which was inspired by C++&#x27;s Standard Template Library.

A &quot;generic unit&quot; is a package or a subprogram that takes one or more &quot;generic formal parameters&quot;.

A &quot;generic formal parameter&quot; is a value, a variable, a constant, a type, a subprogram, or even an instance of another, designated, generic unit. For generic formal types, the syntax distinguishes between discrete, floating-point, fixed-point, access (pointer) types, etc. Some formal parameters can have default values.

To &quot;instantiate&quot; a generic unit, the programmer passes &quot;actual&quot; parameters for each formal. The generic instance then behaves just like any other unit. It is possible to instantiate generic units at run-time, for example inside a loop.

=====Example=====
The specification of a generic package:
 generic
 Max_Size : Natural; -- a generic formal value
 type Element_Type is private; -- a generic formal type; accepts any nonlimited type
 package Stacks is
 type Size_Type is range 0 .. Max_Size;
 type Stack is limited private;
 procedure Create (S : out Stack;
 Initial_Size : in Size_Type := Max_Size);
 procedure Push (Into : in out Stack; Element : in Element_Type);
 procedure Pop (From : in out Stack; Element : out Element_Type);
 Overflow : exception;
 Underflow : exception;
 private
 subtype Index_Type is Size_Type range 1 .. Max_Size;
 type Vector is array (Index_Type range &lt;&gt;) of Element_Type;
 type Stack (Allocated_Size : Size_Type := 0) is record
 Top : Index_Type;
 Storage : Vector (1 .. Allocated_Size);
 end record;
 end Stacks;
Instantiating the generic package:
 type Bookmark_Type is new Natural;
 -- records a location in the text document we are editing

 package Bookmark_Stacks is new Stacks (Max_Size =&gt; 20,
 Element_Type =&gt; Bookmark_Type);
 -- Allows the user to jump between recorded locations in a document
Using an instance of a generic package:
 type Document_Type is record
 Contents : Ada.Strings.Unbounded.Unbounded_String;
 Bookmarks : Bookmark_Stacks.Stack;
 end record;

 procedure Edit (Document_Name : in String) is
 Document : Document_Type;
 begin
 -- Initialise the stack of bookmarks:
 Bookmark_Stacks.Create (S =&gt; Document.Bookmarks, Initial_Size =&gt; 10);
 -- Now, open the file Document_Name and read it in...
 end Edit;
=====Advantages and limits=====
The language syntax allows precise specification of constraints on generic formal parameters. For example, it is possible to specify that a generic formal type will only accept a modular type as the actual. It is also possible to express constraints &quot;between&quot; generic formal parameters; for example:
 generic
 type Index_Type is (&lt;&gt;); -- must be a discrete type
 type Element_Type is private; -- can be any nonlimited type
 type Array_Type is array (Index_Type range &lt;&gt;) of Element_Type;
In this example, Array_Type is constrained by both Index_Type and Element_Type. When instantiating the unit, the programmer must pass an actual array type that satisfies these constraints.

The disadvantage of this fine-grained control is a complicated syntax, but, because all generic formal parameters are completely defined in the specification, the compiler can instantiate generics without looking at the body of the generic.

Unlike C++, Ada does not allow specialised generic instances, and requires that all generics be instantiated explicitly. These rules have several consequences:
* the compiler can implement &quot;shared generics&quot;: the object code for a generic unit can be shared between all instances (unless the programmer requests inlining of subprograms, of course). As further consequences:
** there is no possibility of code bloat (code bloat is common in C++ and requires special care, as explained below).
** it is possible to instantiate generics at run-time, and at compile time, since no new object code is required for a new instance.
** actual objects corresponding to a generic formal object are always considered to be non-static inside the generic; see in the Wikibook for details and consequences.
* all instances of a generic being exactly the same, it is easier to review and understand programs written by others; there are no &quot;special cases&quot; to take into account.
* all instantiations being explicit, there are no hidden instantiations that might make it difficult to understand the program.
* Ada does not permit arbitrary computation at compile time, because operations on generic arguments are performed at runtime.

====Templates in C++====

C++ uses templates to enable generic programming techniques. The C++ Standard Library includes the Standard Template Library or STL that provides a framework of templates for common data structures and algorithms. Templates in C++ may also be used for template metaprogramming, which is a way of pre-evaluating some of the code at compile-time rather than run-time. Using template specialization, C++ Templates are Turing complete.

=====Technical overview=====
There are many kinds of templates, the most common being function templates and class templates. A &quot;function template&quot; is a pattern for creating ordinary functions based upon the parameterizing types supplied when instantiated. For example, the C++ Standard Template Library contains the function template codice_9 that creates functions that return either &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y,&quot; whichever is larger. codice_10 could be defined like this:
template&lt;typename T&gt;
T max(T x, T y) {
 return x &lt; y ? y : x;


&quot;Specializations&quot; of this function template, instantiations with specific types, can be called just like an ordinary function:
std::cout « max(3, 7); // Outputs 7.
The compiler examines the arguments used to call codice_11 and determines that this is a call to codice_12. It then instantiates a version of the function where the parameterizing type codice_3 is codice_14, making the equivalent of the following function:
int max(int x, int y) {
 return x &lt; y ? y : x;


This works whether the arguments codice_15 and codice_16 are integers, strings, or any other type for which the expression codice_17 is sensible, or more specifically, for any type for which codice_18 is defined. Common inheritance is not needed for the set of types that can be used, and so it is very similar to duck typing. A program defining a custom data type can use operator overloading to define the meaning of codice_19 for that type, thus allowing its use with the codice_10 function template. While this may seem a minor benefit in this isolated example, in the context of a comprehensive library like the STL it allows the programmer to get extensive functionality for a new data type, just by defining a few operators for it. Merely defining codice_19 allows a type to be used with the standard codice_22, codice_23, and codice_24 algorithms or to be put inside data structures such as codice_25s, heaps, and associative arrays.

C++ templates are completely type safe at compile time. As a demonstration, the standard type codice_26 does not define the codice_19 operator, because there is no strict order on complex numbers. Therefore, codice_9 will fail with a compile error, if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are codice_26 values. Likewise, other templates that rely on codice_19 cannot be applied to codice_26 data unless a comparison (in the form of a functor or function) is provided. E.g.: A codice_26 cannot be used as key for a codice_33 unless a comparison is provided. Unfortunately, compilers historically generate somewhat esoteric, long, and unhelpful error messages for this sort of error. Ensuring that a certain object adheres to a method protocol can alleviate this issue. Languages which use codice_34 instead of codice_19 can also use codice_26 values as keys.

Another kind of template, a &quot;class template,&quot; extends the same concept to classes. A class template specialization is a class. Class templates are often used to make generic containers. For example, the STL has a linked list container. To make a linked list of integers, one writes codice_37. A list of strings is denoted codice_38. A codice_39 has a set of standard functions associated with it, that work for any compatible parameterizing types.

=====Template specialization=====
A powerful feature of C++&#x27;s templates is &quot;template specialization&quot;. This allows alternative implementations to be provided based on certain characteristics of the parameterized type that is being instantiated. Template specialization has two purposes: to allow certain forms of optimization, and to reduce code bloat.

For example, consider a codice_22 template function. One of the primary activities that such a function does is to swap or exchange the values in two of the container&#x27;s positions. If the values are large (in terms of the number of bytes it takes to store each of them), then it is often quicker to first build a separate list of pointers to the objects, sort those pointers, and then build the final sorted sequence. If the values are quite small however it is usually fastest to just swap the values in-place as needed. Furthermore, if the parameterized type is already of some pointer-type, then there is no need to build a separate pointer array. Template specialization allows the template creator to write different implementations and to specify the characteristics that the parameterized type(s) must have for each implementation to be used.

Unlike function templates, class templates can be partially specialized. That means that an alternate version of the class template code can be provided when some of the template parameters are known, while leaving other template parameters generic. This can be used, for example, to create a default implementation (the &quot;primary specialization&quot;) that assumes that copying a parameterizing type is expensive and then create partial specializations for types that are cheap to copy, thus increasing overall efficiency. Clients of such a class template just use specializations of it without needing to know whether the compiler used the primary specialization or some partial specialization in each case. Class templates can also be &quot;fully specialized,&quot; which means that an alternate implementation can be provided when all of the parameterizing types are known.

=====Advantages and disadvantages=====
Some uses of templates, such as the codice_10 function, were formerly filled by function-like preprocessor macros (a legacy of the C language). For example, here is a possible implementation of such macro:
#define max(a,b) ((a) &lt; (b) ? (b) : (a))
Macros are expanded (copy pasted) by the preprocessor, before program compiling; templates are actual real functions. Macros are always expanded inline; templates can also be inline functions when the compiler deems it appropriate.

However, templates are generally considered an improvement over macros for these purposes. Templates are type-safe. Templates avoid some of the common errors found in code that makes heavy use of function-like macros, such as evaluating parameters with side effects twice. Perhaps most importantly, templates were designed to be applicable to much larger problems than macros.

There are four primary drawbacks to the use of templates: supported features, compiler support, poor error messages (usually with pre C++20 &quot;substitution failure is not an error&quot; (SFINAE)), and code bloat:
# Templates in C++ lack many features, which makes implementing them and using them in a straightforward way often impossible. Instead programmers have to rely on complex tricks which leads to bloated, hard to understand and hard to maintain code. Current developments in the C++ standards exacerbate this problem by making heavy use of these tricks and building a lot of new features for templates on them or with them intended.
# Many compilers historically had poor support for templates, thus the use of templates could make code somewhat less portable. Support may also be poor when a C++ compiler is being used with a linker that is not C++-aware, or when attempting to use templates across shared library boundaries.
# Compilers can produce confusing, long, and sometimes unhelpful error messages when errors are detected in code that uses SFINAE. This can make templates difficult to develop with.
# Finally, the use of templates requires the compiler to generate a separate &quot;instance&quot; of the templated class or function for every type parameters used with it. (This is necessary because types in C++ are not all the same size, and the sizes of data fields are important to how classes work.) So the indiscriminate use of templates can lead to code bloat, resulting in excessively large executables. However, judicious use of template specialization and derivation can dramatically reduce such code bloat in some cases:
# Templated classes or functions may require an &quot;explicit specialization&quot; of the template class which would require rewriting of an entire class for a specific template parameters used by it.
The extra instantiations generated by templates can also cause some debuggers to have difficulty working gracefully with templates. For example, setting a debug breakpoint within a template from a source file may either miss setting the breakpoint in the actual instantiation desired or may set a breakpoint in every place the template is instantiated.

Also, the implementation source code for the template must be completely available (e.g. included in a header) to the translation unit (source file) using it. Templates, including much of the Standard Library, if not included in header files, cannot be compiled. (This is in contrast to non-templated code, which may be compiled to binary, providing only a declarations header file for code using it.) This may be a disadvantage by exposing the implementing code, which removes some abstractions, and could restrict its use in closed-source projects.

====Templates in D====
The D language supports templates based in design on C++. Most C++ template idioms work in D without alteration, but D adds some functionality:
* Template parameters in D are not restricted to just types and primitive values (as it was in C++ before C++20), but also allow arbitrary compile-time values (such as strings and struct literals), and aliases to arbitrary identifiers, including other templates or template instantiations.
* Template constraints and the codice_42 statement provide an alternative to respectively C++&#x27;s C++ concepts and codice_43.
* The codice_44 expression allows speculative instantiation to verify an object&#x27;s traits at compile time.
* The codice_45 keyword and the codice_46 expression allow type inference for variable declarations and function return values, which in turn allows &quot;Voldemort types&quot; (types that do not have a global name).

Templates in D use a different syntax than in C++: whereas in C++ template parameters are wrapped in angular brackets (codice_47),
D uses an exclamation sign and parentheses: codice_48.
This avoids the C++ parsing difficulties due to ambiguity with comparison operators.
If there is only one parameter, the parentheses can be omitted.

Conventionally, D combines the above features to provide compile-time polymorphism using trait-based generic programming.
For example, an input range is defined as any type that satisfies the checks performed by codice_49, which is defined as follows:
template isInputRange(R)
 enum bool isInputRange = is(typeof(
 (inout int = 0)
 R r = R.init; // can define a range object
 if (r.empty) {} // can test for empty
 r.popFront(); // can invoke popFront()
 auto h = r.front; // can get the front of the range
}
A function that accepts only input ranges can then use the above template in a template constraint:
auto fun(Range)(Range range)
 if (isInputRange!Range)
 // ...


=====Code generation=====
In addition to template metaprogramming, D also provides several features to enable compile-time code generation:
* The codice_50 expression allows reading a file from disk and using its contents as a string expression.
* Compile-time reflection allows enumerating and inspecting declarations and their members during compiling.
* User-defined attributes allow users to attach arbitrary identifiers to declarations, which can then be enumerated using compile-time reflection.
* Compile-time function execution (CTFE) allows a subset of D (restricted to safe operations) to be interpreted during compiling.
* String mixins allow evaluating and compiling the contents of a string expression as D code that becomes part of the program.

Combining the above allows generating code based on existing declarations.
For example, D serialization frameworks can enumerate a type&#x27;s members and generate specialized functions for each serialized type
to perform serialization and deserialization.
User-defined attributes could further indicate serialization rules.

The codice_50 expression and compile-time function execution also allow efficiently implementing domain-specific languages.
For example, given a function that takes a string containing an HTML template and returns equivalent D source code, it is possible to use it in the following way:
// Import the contents of example.htt as a string manifest constant.
enum htmlTemplate = import(&quot;example.htt&quot;);

// Transpile the HTML template to D code.
enum htmlDCode = htmlTemplateToD(htmlTemplate);

// Paste the contents of htmlDCode as D code.
mixin(htmlDCode);
====Genericity in Eiffel====
Generic classes have been a part of Eiffel since the original method and language design. The foundation publications of Eiffel, use the term &quot;genericity&quot; to describe creating and using generic classes.

=====Basic, unconstrained genericity=====
Generic classes are declared with their class name and a list of one or more &quot;formal generic parameters&quot;. In the following code, class codice_52 has one formal generic parameter codice_53
class
 LIST [G]
feature -- Access
 item: G
 -- The item currently pointed to by cursor
feature -- Element change
 put (new_item: G)
 -- Add `new_item&#x27; at the end of the list


The formal generic parameters are placeholders for arbitrary class names that will be supplied when a declaration of the generic class is made, as shown in the two &quot;generic derivations&quot; below, where codice_54 and codice_55 are other class names. codice_54 and codice_55 are considered &quot;actual generic parameters&quot; as they provide real class names to substitute for codice_53 in actual use.
 list_of_accounts: LIST [ACCOUNT]
 -- Account list

 list_of_deposits: LIST [DEPOSIT]
 -- Deposit list
Within the Eiffel type system, although class codice_59 is considered a class, it is not considered a type. However, a generic derivation of codice_59 such as codice_61 is considered a type.

=====Constrained genericity=====

For the list class shown above, an actual generic parameter substituting for codice_53 can be any other available class. To constrain the set of classes from which valid actual generic parameters can be chosen, a &quot;generic constraint&quot; can be specified. In the declaration of class codice_63 below, the generic constraint dictates that any valid actual generic parameter will be a class that inherits from class codice_64. The generic constraint ensures that elements of a codice_63 can in fact be sorted.
class
 SORTED_LIST [G -&gt; COMPARABLE]
====Generics in Java====
Support for the &quot;generics&quot;, or &quot;containers-of-type-T&quot; was added to the Java programming language in 2004 as part of J2SE 5.0. In Java, generics are only checked at compile time for type correctness. The generic type information is then removed via a process called type erasure, to maintain compatibility with old JVM implementations, making it unavailable at runtime. For example, a codice_66 is converted to the raw type codice_67. The compiler inserts type casts to convert the elements to the codice_68 type when they are retrieved from the list, reducing performance compared to other implementations such as C++ templates.

====Genericity in .NET [C#, VB.NET]====
Generics were added as part of .NET Framework 2.0 in November 2005, based on a research prototype from Microsoft Research started in 1999. Although similar to generics in Java, .NET generics do not apply type erasure, but implement generics as a first class mechanism in the runtime using reification. This design choice provides additional functionality, such as allowing reflection with preservation of generic types, and alleviating some of the limits of erasure (such as being unable to create generic arrays). This also means that there is no performance hit from runtime casts and normally expensive boxing conversions. When primitive and value types are used as generic arguments, they get specialized implementations, allowing for efficient generic collections and methods. As in C++ and Java, nested generic types such as Dictionary&lt;string, List&lt;int» are valid types, however are advised against for member signatures in code analysis design rules.

.NET allows six varieties of generic type constraints using the codice_69 keyword including restricting generic types to be value types, to be classes, to have constructors, and to implement interfaces. Below is an example with an interface constraint:
using System;

class Sample
 static void Main()
 int[] array = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
 MakeAtLeast&lt;int&gt;(array, 2); // Change array to { 2, 2, 2, 3 }
 foreach (int i in array)
 Console.WriteLine(i); // Print results.
 Console.ReadKey(true);

 static void MakeAtLeast&lt;T&gt;(T[] list, T lowest) where T : IComparable&lt;T&gt;
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.Length; i++)
 if (list[i].CompareTo(lowest) &lt; 0)
 list[i] = lowest;
}
The codice_70 method allows operation on arrays, with elements of generic type codice_3. The method&#x27;s type constraint indicates that the method is applicable to any type codice_3 that implements the generic codice_73 interface. This ensures a compile time error, if the method is called if the type does not support comparison. The interface provides the generic method codice_74.

The above method could also be written without generic types, simply using the non-generic codice_75 type. However, since arrays are contravariant, the casting would not be type safe, and the compiler would be unable to find certain possible errors that would otherwise be caught when using generic types. In addition, the method would need to access the array items as codice_76s instead, and would require casting to compare two elements. (For value types like types such as codice_14 this requires a boxing conversion, although this can be worked around using the codice_78 class, as is done in the standard collection classes.)

A notable behavior of static members in a generic .NET class is static member instantiation per run-time type (see example below).
 // A generic class
 public class GenTest&lt;T&gt;
 // A static variable - will be created for each type on reflection
 static CountedInstances OnePerType = new CountedInstances();

 // a data member
 private T _t;

 // simple constructor
 public GenTest(T t)
 _t = t;
 }

 // a class
 public class CountedInstances
 //Static variable - this will be incremented once per instance
 public static int Counter;

 //simple constructor
 public CountedInstances()
 //increase counter by one during object instantiation
 CountedInstances.Counter++;
 }

// main code entry point
// at the end of execution, CountedInstances.Counter = 2
GenTest&lt;int&gt; g1 = new GenTest&lt;int&gt;(1);
GenTest&lt;int&gt; g11 = new GenTest&lt;int&gt;(11);
GenTest&lt;int&gt; g111 = new GenTest&lt;int&gt;(111);
GenTest&lt;double&gt; g2 = new GenTest&lt;double&gt;(1.0);
====Genericity in Pascal====
For Pascal, generics were first implemented in 2006, in the implementation Free Pascal.

=====In Delphi=====
The Object Pascal dialect Delphi acquired generics in the 2007 Delphi 11 release by CodeGear, initially only with the .NET compiler (since discontinued) before being added to the native code in the 2009 Delphi 12 release. The semantics and abilities of Delphi generics are largely modelled on those of generics in .NET 2.0, though the implementation is by necessity quite different. Here is a more or less direct translation of the first C# example shown above:
program Sample;

{$APPTYPE CONSOLE}

uses
 Generics.Defaults; //for IComparer&lt;&gt;

type
 TUtils = class
 class procedure MakeAtLeast&lt;T&gt;(Arr: TArray&lt;T&gt;; const Lowest: T;
 Comparer: IComparer&lt;T&gt;); overload;
 class procedure MakeAtLeast&lt;T&gt;(Arr: TArray&lt;T&gt;; const Lowest: T); overload;
 end;

class procedure TUtils.MakeAtLeast&lt;T&gt;(Arr: TArray&lt;T&gt;; const Lowest: T;
 Comparer: IComparer&lt;T&gt;);
var
 I: Integer;
begin
 if Comparer = nil then Comparer := TComparer&lt;T&gt;.Default;
 for I := Low(Arr) to High(Arr) do
 if Comparer.Compare(Arr[I], Lowest) &lt; 0 then
 Arr[I] := Lowest;
end;

class procedure TUtils.MakeAtLeast&lt;T&gt;(Arr: TArray&lt;T&gt;; const Lowest: T);
begin
 MakeAtLeast&lt;T&gt;(Arr, Lowest, nil);
end;

var
 Ints: TArray&lt;Integer&gt;;
 Value: Integer;
begin
 Ints := TArray&lt;Integer&gt;.Create(0, 1, 2, 3);
 TUtils.MakeAtLeast&lt;Integer&gt;(Ints, 2);
 for Value in Ints do
 WriteLn(Value);
 ReadLn;
end.
As with C#, methods and whole types can have one or more type parameters. In the example, TArray is a generic type (defined by the language) and MakeAtLeast a generic method. The available constraints are very similar to the available constraints in C#: any value type, any class, a specific class or interface, and a class with a parameterless constructor. Multiple constraints act as an additive union.

=====In Free Pascal=====
Free Pascal implemented generics in 2006 in version 2.2.0, before Delphi and with different syntax and semantics. However, since FPC version 2.6.0, the Delphi-style syntax is available when using the language mode codice_79. Thus, Free Pascal code supports generics in either style.

Delphi and Free Pascal example:

// Delphi style
unit A;

{$ifdef fpc}
 {$mode delphi}
{$endif}

interface

type
 TGenericClass&lt;T&gt; = class
 function Foo(const AValue: T): T;
 end;

implementation

function TGenericClass&lt;T&gt;.Foo(const AValue: T): T;
begin
 Result := AValue + AValue;
end;

end.

// Free Pascal&#x27;s ObjFPC style

====Genericity in Haskell====
The type class mechanism of Haskell supports generic programming. Six of the predefined type classes in Haskell (including codice_80, the types that can be compared for equality, and codice_81, the types whose values can be rendered as strings) have the special property of supporting &quot;derived instances.&quot; This means that a programmer defining a new type can state that this type is to be an instance of one of these special type classes, without providing implementations of the class methods as is usually necessary when declaring class instances. All the necessary methods will be &quot;derived&quot; – that is, constructed automatically – based on the structure of the type. For example, the following declaration of a type of binary trees states that it is to be an instance of the classes codice_80 and codice_81:
data BinTree a = Leaf a | Node (BinTree a) a (BinTree a)
 deriving (Eq, Show)
This results in an equality function (codice_84) and a string representation function (codice_85) being automatically defined for any type of the form codice_86 provided that codice_3 itself supports those operations.

The support for derived instances of codice_80 and codice_81 makes their methods codice_84 and codice_85 generic in a qualitatively different way from parametrically polymorphic functions: these &quot;functions&quot; (more accurately, type-indexed families of functions) can be applied to values of various types, and although they behave differently for every argument type, little work is needed to add support for a new type. Ralf Hinze (2004) has shown that a similar effect can be achieved for user-defined type classes by certain programming techniques. Other researchers have proposed approaches to this and other kinds of genericity in the context of Haskell and extensions to Haskell (discussed below).

===== PolyP =====
PolyP was the first generic programming language extension to Haskell. In PolyP, generic functions are called &quot;polytypic&quot;. The language introduces a special construct in which such polytypic functions can be defined via structural induction over the structure of the pattern functor of a regular datatype. Regular datatypes in PolyP are a subset of Haskell datatypes. A regular datatype t must be of kind &quot;* → *&quot;, and if &quot;a&quot; is the formal type argument in the definition, then all recursive calls to &quot;t&quot; must have the form &quot;t a&quot;. These restrictions rule out higher-kinded datatypes and nested datatypes, where the recursive calls are of a different form.
The flatten function in PolyP is here provided as an example:
 flatten :: Regular d =&gt; d a -&gt; [a]
 flatten = cata fl

 polytypic fl :: f a [a] -&gt; [a]
 case f of
 g+h -&gt; either fl fl
 g*h -&gt; \(x,y) -&gt; fl x ++ fl y
 () -&gt; \x -&gt; []
 Par -&gt; \x -&gt; [x]
 Rec -&gt; \x -&gt; x
 d@g -&gt; concat . flatten . pmap fl
 Con t -&gt; \x -&gt; []

 cata :: Regular d =&gt; (FunctorOf d a b -&gt; b) -&gt; d a -&gt; b
=====Generic Haskell=====
Generic Haskell is another extension to Haskell, developed at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. The extensions it provides are:
*&quot;Type-indexed values&quot; are defined as a value indexed over the various Haskell type constructors (unit, primitive types, sums, products, and user-defined type constructors). In addition, we can also specify the behaviour of a type-indexed values for a specific constructor using &quot;constructor cases&quot;, and reuse one generic definition in another using &quot;default cases&quot;.
The resulting type-indexed value can be specialized to any type.
*&quot;Kind-indexed types&quot; are types indexed over kinds, defined by giving a case for both &quot;*&quot; and &quot;k → k&quot;&#x27;. Instances are obtained by applying the kind-indexed type to a kind.
*Generic definitions can be used by applying them to a type or kind. This is called &quot;generic application&quot;. The result is a type or value, depending on which sort of generic definition is applied.
*&quot;Generic abstraction&quot; enables generic definitions be defined by abstracting a type parameter (of a given kind).
*&quot;Type-indexed types&quot; are types that are indexed over the type constructors. These can be used to give types to more involved generic values. The resulting type-indexed types can be specialized to any type.

As an example, the equality function in Generic Haskell:
 type Eq {[ * ]} t1 t2 = t1 -&gt; t2 -&gt; Bool
 type Eq {[ k -&gt; l ]} t1 t2 = forall u1 u2. Eq {[ k ]} u1 u2 -&gt; Eq {[ l ]} (t1 u1) (t2 u2)

 eq :: Eq {[ k ]} t t
 eq _ _ = True
 eq eqA eqB (Inl a1) (Inl a2) = eqA a1 a2
 eq eqA eqB (Inr b1) (Inr b2) = eqB b1 b2
 eq eqA eqB _ _ = False
 eq eqA eqB (a1 :*: b1) (a2 :*: b2) = eqA a1 a2 &amp;&amp; eqB b1 b2
 eq = (==)
 eq = (==)
 eq = (==)
====Clean====
Clean offers generic programming based PolyP and the Generic Haskell as supported by the GHC ≥ 6.0. It parametrizes by kind as those but offers overloading.

===Other languages===
Languages in the ML family support generic programming through parametric polymorphism and generic modules called &quot;functors.&quot; Both Standard ML and OCaml provide functors, which are similar to class templates and to Ada&#x27;s generic packages. Scheme syntactic abstractions also have a connection to genericity – these are in fact a superset of C++ templates.

A Verilog module may take one or more parameters, to which their actual values are assigned upon the instantiation of the module. One example is a generic register array where the array width is given via a parameter. Such an array, combined with a generic wire vector, can make a generic buffer or memory module with an arbitrary bit width out of a single module implementation.

VHDL, being derived from Ada, also has generic abilities.

C supports &quot;type-generic expressions&quot; using the keyword:

#define cbrt(x) _Generic((x), long double: cbrtl, \
 default: cbrt, \
 float: cbrtf)(x)

<text>Nigel Tranter OBE (23 November 1909 – 9 January 2000) was a writer of a wide range of books on history and architecture, both fiction and non-fiction. He was best-known for his popular and well-researched historical novels, covering centuries of Scottish history.

==Early life==

Nigel Tranter was born in Glasgow and educated at George Heriot&#x27;s School in Edinburgh. He trained as an accountant and worked in Scottish National Insurance Company, founded by his uncle. In 1933, he married May Jean Campbell Grieve and had two children, Frances May and Philip. He joined the Royal Artillery and served in East Anglia in the Second World War.

==Writings==

From childhood onwards, Tranter took a great interest in castles and their associated history. As a result, in 1935, at age 25, he published his first book, &quot;The Fortalices and Early Mansions of Southern Scotland&quot;. Encouraged by his wife, he wrote his first novel, &quot;In Our Arms Our Fortune&quot;, which was rejected by the publishers. However, &quot;Trespass&quot; soon followed and was accepted by The Moray Press. Unfortunately, they went bankrupt soon after its publication in 1937, and he didn&#x27;t receive any payment. Over the next few years, he wrote several more novels in the same vein: light-hearted romantic adventures in varied settings from modern-day Europe to historical Scotland. Tranter also wrote several westerns under the pseudonym Nye Tredgold to provide additional income for his family, and a dozen children&#x27;s books -adventure stories aimed at 8- to 10-year-olds.

War service did not stop Tranter writing, and a number of novels were published during the war years, some inspired by his own experiences.

Between 1962 and 1971 Tranter published the landmark series &quot;The Fortified House in Scotland&quot; (in five volumes). This attempted to cover the history and structure of every primarily domestic castle in Scotland, 663 buildings in all. A small number of non-domestic buildings associated with priories, churches, communal defence etc. etc. were also included. Highly regarded at the time, it is still read by those who have an interest in this specialist area.

While researching the castles, Tranter realised that there were many characters and incidents in Scottish history which could be used as the basis for novels, which he tried to make as accurate as possible – while making no effort to hide his own strong Scottish identity. &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Grace&quot; (1953) was his first novel to focus on an historical character (in this case, Mary, Queen of Scots), although it contained a high fictional content. Two trilogies followed: the &quot;MacGregor Trilogy&quot; (1957–1962) and the &quot;Master of Gray Trilogy&quot; (1961–1965). By this time, Tranter was well established as a writer of serious historical fiction. The fictional content decreased as he became more experienced, and his later novels were almost entirely composed around the historical record. These novels have gained a wide readership while providing a basic grounding in Scottish history to their readers.

==The historian==

As noted above, Tranter had a lifelong interest in Scottish castles. Initially intrigued by their architectural history, Tranter soon developed an interest in Scottish history generally. As he moved into historical novels, his research became deeper until he had amassed vast knowledge of Scotland&#x27;s history to a very detailed level. His ability to retell history as a &#x27;story&#x27; provided an accessible source for many people. As well as his novels, this knowledge was translated into such non-fiction works as &quot;The Story of Scotland&quot;. Becoming intimate with so much of the historical record, Tranter formed many theories of history, some of which were contrary to established thought. These were presented throughout his books. One example of this is his belief that the stone under the Coronation Chair is not the true Stone of Destiny, but a thirteenth-century fake which he refers to as the Westminster Stone.

==Public life==

Tranter was involved in many activities outside his writing. From the 1940s onwards he delivered lectures to private groups and organisations, and, as his writing career developed, he undertook many speaking engagements, including some tours to the USA. He was also invited to join—or was instrumental in setting up—many committees and community groups, in fields as diverse as Scottish Highlands roads and settlement, wild fowling and Athelstaneford&#x27;s Flag Fund.

His notable involvements include: the original Scottish Convention, a cross-party pressure group established during the 1940s to encourage devolution (Edinburgh chairman); National Covenant Association; National Forth Road Bridge Committee; Saltire Society (honorary president).

Following the publication of &quot;The Fortified House in Scotland&quot;, Tranter was regularly asked for advice on the restoration of many tower houses and castles. He was closely involved in the restoration of over 60 castles, such as Fa&#x27;side Castle and Menstrie Castle.

==Death==
He died on 9 January 2000, aged 90, after contracting flu, in Gullane, where his funeral and burial took place.

A final eight novels were published after Tranter&#x27;s death, the last book &quot;Hope Endures&quot; appearing in 2005. According to his daughter these &quot;were all finished at the time of his death, as he always kept ahead in his writing&quot;.

==Bibliography==
A number of the books produced by Tranter had dust jackets designed by the illustrator Val Biro.

<text>Gibbons () are apes in the family Hylobatidae (). The family historically contained one genus, but now is split into four extant genera and 20 species. Gibbons live in subtropical and tropical forests from eastern Bangladesh and Northeast India to Southeast Asia and Indonesia (including the islands of Sumatra, Borneo and Java).

Also called the lesser apes, gibbons differ from the great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and humans) in being smaller, exhibiting low sexual dimorphism, and not making nests. Like all of the apes, gibbons are tailless. Unlike most of the great apes, gibbons frequently form long-term pair bonds. Their primary mode of locomotion, brachiation, involves swinging from branch to branch for distances up to , at speeds as fast as . They can also make leaps up to , and walk bipedally with their arms raised for balance. They are the fastest of all tree-dwelling, nonflying mammals.

Depending on the species and sex, gibbons&#x27; fur coloration varies from dark- to light-brown shades, and any shade between black and white, though a completely &quot;white&quot; gibbon is rare.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;gibbon&quot; is a reborrowing from French and may originally derive from an Orang Asli word.

==Evolutionary history==
Whole genome molecular dating analyses indicate that the gibbon lineage diverged from that of great apes around 16.8 million years ago (Mya) (95% confidence interval: 15.9–17.6 Mya; given a divergence of 29 Mya from Old World monkeys). Adaptive divergence associated with chromosomal rearrangements led to rapid radiation of the four genera 5–7 Mya. Each genus comprises a distinct, well-delineated lineage, but the sequence and timing of divergences among these genera has been hard to resolve, even with whole genome data, due to radiative speciations and extensive incomplete lineage sorting. An analysis based on morphology suggests that the four genera are ordered as (&quot;Symphalangus&quot;, (&quot;Nomascus&quot;, (&quot;Hoolock&quot;, &quot;Hylobates&quot;))).

A coalescent-based species tree analysis of genome-scale datasets suggests a phylogeny for the four genera ordered as (&quot;Hylobates&quot;, (&quot;Nomascus&quot;, (&quot;Hoolock&quot;, &quot;Symphalangus&quot;))).

At the species level, estimates from mitochondrial DNA genome analyses suggest that &quot;Hylobates pileatus&quot; diverged from &quot;H. lar&quot; and &quot;H. agilis&quot; around 3.9 Mya, and &quot;H. lar&quot; and &quot;H. agilis&quot; separated around 3.3 Mya. Whole genome analysis suggests divergence of &quot;H. pileatus&quot; from &quot;H. moloch&quot; 1.5–3.0 Mya. The extinct &quot;Bunopithecus sericus&quot; is a gibbon or gibbon-like ape, which until recently, was thought to be closely related to the hoolock gibbons.

==Taxonomy==

The family is divided into four genera based on their diploid chromosome number: &quot;Hylobates&quot; (44), &quot;Hoolock&quot; (38), &quot;Nomascus&quot; (52), and &quot;Symphalangus&quot; (50). Also, three extinct genera currently are recognised: &quot;Bunopithecus&quot;, &quot;Junzi&quot;, and &quot;Yuanmoupithecus&quot;.

===Hybrids===
Many gibbons are hard to identify based on fur coloration, so are identified either by song or genetics. These morphological ambiguities have led to hybrids in zoos. Zoos often receive gibbons of unknown origin, so they rely on morphological variation or labels that are impossible to verify to assign species and subspecies names, so separate species of gibbons commonly are misidentified and housed together. Interspecific hybrids, within a genus, are also suspected to occur in wild gibbons where their ranges overlap. No records exist, however, of fertile hybrids between different gibbon genera, either in the wild or in captivity.

==Description==

One unique aspect of a gibbon&#x27;s anatomy is the wrist, which functions something like a ball-and-socket joint, allowing for biaxial movement. This greatly reduces the amount of energy needed in the upper arm and torso, while also reducing stress on the shoulder joint. Gibbons also have long hands and feet, with a deep cleft between the first and second digits of their hands. Their fur is usually black, gray, or brownish, often with white markings on hands, feet and face. Some species such as the siamang have an enlarged throat sac, which inflates and serves as a resonating chamber when the animals call. This structure can become quite large in some species, sometimes equaling the size of the animal&#x27;s head. Their voices are much more powerful than that of any human singer, although they are at best half a human&#x27;s height.

Gibbon skulls and teeth resemble those of the great apes, and their noses are similar to those of all catarrhine primates. The dental formula is . The siamang, which is the largest of the 18 species, is distinguished by having two fingers on each foot stuck together, hence the generic and species names &quot;Symphalangus&quot; and &quot;syndactylus&quot;.

==Behavior==
Like all primates, gibbons are social animals. They are strongly territorial, and defend their boundaries with vigorous visual and vocal displays. The vocal element, which can often be heard for distances up to , consists of a duet between a mated pair, with their young sometimes joining in. In most species, males and some females sing solos to attract mates, as well as advertise their territories. The song can be used to identify not only which species of gibbon is singing, but also the area from which it comes.

Gibbons often retain the same mate for life, although they do not always remain sexually monogamous. In addition to extra-pair copulations, pair-bonded gibbons occasionally &quot;divorce&quot;. About 10% of gibbon groups studied in the wild contained more than two adults. In these cases, the limitation of food availability on group size may be relaxed, allowing more adults to congregate together without a significant increase in competition.

Gibbons are among nature&#x27;s best brachiators. Their ball-and-socket wrist joints allow them unmatched speed and accuracy when swinging through trees. Nonetheless, their mode of transportation can lead to hazards when a branch breaks or a hand slips, and researchers estimate that the majority of gibbons suffer bone fractures one or more times during their lifetimes. They are the fastest of all tree-dwelling, nonflying mammals. On the ground, gibbons tend to walk bipedally, and their Achilles tendon morphology is more similar to that of humans than that of any other ape.

==Diet==
Gibbons&#x27; diets are about 60% fruit-based, but they also consume twigs, leaves, insects, flowers, and occasionally birds&#x27; eggs. Levels of frugivory vary between populations and species of gibbons and are best predicted by local fruit availability. The most folivorous gibbon species come from the genus &quot;Nomascus,&quot; whose higher reliance on leaves is thought to be because they live in high altitude seasonal habitats that lack year-round abundant fruits.

== Genetics ==

Gibbons were the first apes to diverge from the common ancestor of humans and other great apes about 16.8 Mya. With a genome that has a 96% similarity to humans, the gibbon has a role as a bridge between Old World monkeys, such as macaques, and the great apes. According to a study that mapped synteny (genes occurring on the same chromosome) disruptions in the gibbon and human genome, humans and other great apes are part of the same superfamily (Hominoidea) with gibbons. The karyotype of gibbons, however, diverged in a much more rapid fashion from the common hominoid ancestor than other apes.

The common ancestor of hominoids is shown to have a minimum of 24 major chromosomal rearrangements from the presumed gibbon ancestor&#x27;s karyotype. Reaching the common gibbon ancestor&#x27;s karyotype from today&#x27;s various living species of gibbons will require up to 28 additional rearrangements. Adding up, this implies that at least 52 major chromosomal rearrangements are needed to compare the common hominoid ancestor to today&#x27;s gibbons. No common specific sequence element in the independent rearrangements was found, while 46% of the gibbon-human synteny breakpoints occur in segmental duplication regions. This is an indication that these major differences in humans and gibbons could have had a common source of plasticity or change. Researchers view this unusually high rate of chromosomal rearrangement that is specific in small apes such as gibbons could potentially be due to factors that increase the rate of chromosomal breakage or factors that allow derivative chromosomes to be fixed in a homozygous state while mostly lost in other mammals.

The whole genome of the gibbons in Southeast Asia was first sequenced in 2014 by the German Primate Center, including Christian Roos, Markus Brameier, and Lutz Walter, along with other international researchers. One of the gibbons that had its genome sequenced is a white-cheeked gibbon (&quot;Nomascus leucogenys&quot;, NLE) named Asia. The team found that a jumping DNA element named LAVA transposon (also called gibbon-specific retrotransposon) is unique to the gibbon genome apart from humans and the great apes. The LAVA transposon increases mutation rate, thus is supposed to have contributed to the rapid and greater change in gibbons in comparison to their close relatives, which is critical for evolutionary development. The very high rate of chromosomal disorder and rearrangements (such as duplications, deletions or inversions of large stretches of DNA) due to the moving of this large DNA segment is one of the key features that are unique to the gibbon genome.

A special feature of the LAVA transposon is that it positioned itself precisely between genes that are involved in chromosome segregation and distribution during cell division, which results in a premature termination state leading to an alteration in transcription. This incorporation of the jumping gene near genes involved in chromosome replication is thought to make the rearrangement in the genome even more likely, leading to a greater diversity within the gibbon genera.

In addition, some characteristic genes in the gibbon genome had gone through a positive selection and are suggested to give rise to specific anatomical features for gibbons to adapt to their new environment. One of them is &quot;TBX5&quot;, which is a gene that is required for the development of the front extremities or forelimbs such as long arms. The other is &quot;COL1A1&quot;, which is responsible for the development of collagen, a protein that is directly involved with the forming of connective tissues, bone, and cartilage. This gene is thought to have a role in gibbons&#x27; stronger muscles.

Researchers have found a coincidence between major environmental changes in Southeast Asia about 5 Mya that caused a cyclical dynamic of expansions and contractions of their forest habitat, an instance of radiation experienced by the gibbon genera. This may have led to the development of a suite of physical characteristics, distinct from their great ape relatives, to adapt to their habitat of dense, canopy forest.

These crucial findings in genetics have contributed to the use of gibbons as a genetic model for chromosome breakage and fusion, which is a type of translocation mutation. The unusually high number of structural changes in the DNA and chromosomal rearrangements could lead to problematic consequences in some species. Gibbons, however, not only seemed to be free from problems but let the change help them effectively adapt to their environment. Thus, gibbons are organisms on which genetics research could be focused to broaden the implications to human diseases related to chromosomal changes, such as cancer, including chronic myeloid leukemia.

==Conservation status==
Most species are either endangered or critically endangered (the sole exception being &quot;H. leuconedys&quot;, which is vulnerable), primarily due to degradation or loss of their forest habitats. On the island of Phuket in Thailand, a volunteer-based Gibbon Rehabilitation Center rescues gibbons that were kept in captivity, and are being released back into the wild. The Kalaweit Project also has gibbon rehabilitation centers on Borneo and Sumatra.

The IUCN Species Survival Commission Primate Specialist Group announced 2015 to be the Year of the Gibbon and initiated events to be held around the world in zoos to promote awareness of the status of gibbons.

==In traditional Chinese culture==
Sinologist Robert van Gulik concluded gibbons were widespread in central and southern China until at least the Song dynasty, and furthermore, based on an analysis of references to primates in Chinese poetry and other literature and their portrayal in Chinese paintings, the Chinese word &quot;yuán&quot; (猿) referred specifically to gibbons until they were extirpated throughout most of the country due to habitat destruction (around the 14th century). In modern usage, however, &quot;yuán&quot; is a generic word for ape. Early Chinese writers viewed the &quot;noble&quot; gibbons, gracefully moving high in the treetops, as the &quot;gentlemen&quot; (&quot;jūnzǐ&quot;, 君子) of the forest, in contrast to the greedy macaques, attracted by human food. The Taoists ascribed occult properties to gibbons, believing them to be able to live for several hundred years and to turn into humans.

Gibbon figurines as old as from the fourth to third centuries BCE (the Zhou dynasty) have been found in China. Later on, gibbons became a popular subject for Chinese painters, especially during the Song dynasty and early Yuan dynasty, when Yì Yuánjí and Mùqī Fǎcháng excelled in painting these apes. From Chinese cultural influence, the Zen motif of the &quot;gibbon grasping at the reflection of the moon in the water&quot; became popular in Japanese art, as well, though gibbons have never occurred naturally in Japan.

<text>Inter-city rail services are express trains that run services that connect cities over longer distances than commuter or regional trains. They include rail services that are neither short-distance commuter rail trains within one city area nor slow regional rail trains stopping at all stations and covering local journeys only. An inter-city train is typically an express train with limited stops and comfortable carriages to serve long-distance travel.

Inter-city rail sometimes provides international services. This is most prevalent in Europe because of the proximity of its 50 countries to a 10,180,000-square-kilometre (3,930,000-square-mile) area. Eurostar and EuroCity are examples. In many European countries, the word InterCity or Inter-City is an official brand name for a network of regular-interval and relatively long-distance train services that meet certain criteria of speed and comfort. That use of the term appeared in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and has been widely imitated.

== Speed ==
The speeds of inter-city rail lines are quite diverse, ranging from in a mountainous area or on undeveloped tracks to on newly constructed or improved tracks. As a result, Inter-city rail may or may not fall into the category of higher-speed rail or high-speed rail. Ideally, the average speed of inter-city rail service would be faster than in order to be competitive with car, bus and other methods of transport.

=== Distance of inter-city rail ===

* 50–100 km

The distance of an inter-city rail journey is usually at least , although in many large metropolitan areas commuter and regional services cover equal or longer distances. Examples of countries with relatively short intercity rail distances with service patterns comparable to regional rail include Belgium, Israel, The Netherlands, and Switzerland.

* 100–500 km

A distance of is a common journey distance for inter-city rail in many countries. In many cases, railway travel is most competitive at about two to three hours journey time. Inter-city rail can often compete with highways and short-haul air travel for journeys of this distance. Most major intercity railway routes in Europe, such as London to Birmingham, Paris to Lyon, and Lisbon to Porto cover this range of distances.

* 500–1,000 km

In journeys of , the role of inter-city rail is often replaced by faster air travel. Development of high-speed rail in some countries increases the share of railway for such longer-distance journeys. The Paris-Marseille TGV ( in 3 hours) and Tokyo-Aomori Shinkansen ( in 2 hours 59 minutes) are examples of this type of journey. In conventional non high-speed rail, overnight trains are common for this distance.

* 1,000 km or more

In some countries with a dense rail network, large territory, or less air and car transport, such as China, India, and Russia, overnight long-distance train services are provided and used practically.

In many other countries, such long-distance rail journey has been replaced by air travel except for tourism or hobbyist purposes, luxury train journeys, or significant cost benefit. Amtrak long-distance services in the United States, Via Rail&#x27;s Canadian service in Canada, and the Indian Pacific in Australia are examples.

Faster high-speed rail of at least per hour, such as the Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway in China ( in 5 hours) and Tokyo-Sapporo in the proposed Hokkaido Shinkansen in Japan ( in 4 hours), may play a significant role in long-distance travel in the future.

==Inter-city rail by country ==
===Africa===

Railways in Africa are still developing or not practically used for passenger purposes in many countries, but the following countries have inter-city services between major cities:

*Algeria: SNTF
*Egypt: Egyptian National Railways
*Kenya: Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway
*Morocco: ONCF (in French - Office National des Chemins de Fer du Maroc, National Office for Railways of Morocco)
*South Africa: Shosholoza Meyl
*Tunisia: Tunisian Railways (SNCFT)

===Asia===
====East Asia====
====China====
Trains run by China Railway link almost every town and city in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, including Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Xi&#x27;an, and onwards from Shenzhen across the border to Kowloon, in Hong Kong. New high-speed lines from operation are constructed, and many conventional lines are also upgraded to operation. Currently there are seven High-Speed Inter-City lines in China, with up to 21 planned. They are operated independently from the often parallel High-Speed-Rail-Lines.

====Japan====
Japan has six main regional passenger railway companies, known collectively as Japan Railways Group or simply as JR. Five JR companies operate the &quot;bullet trains&quot; on very fast and frequent Shinkansen lines that link all the larger cities, including Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Fukuoka and many more.

Many other cities are covered by a network of JR&#x27;s limited express inter-city trains on narrow-gauge lines. Major cities are covered by convenient train services of every one hour or more frequent. In addition to the JR Group, Japan has major private rail operators such as the Kintetsu, Meitetsu, Tobu Railway and Odakyu Electric Railway that operate &quot;limited express&quot; inter-city services.

====Hong Kong====
Inter-city railway services crossing the Hong Kong-China border (often known as &quot;through trains&quot;) are jointly operated by Hong Kong&#x27;s MTR Corporation Limited and the Ministry of Railways of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Currently, Hung Hom station is the only station in the territory where passengers can catch these cross-border trains. Passengers are required to go through immigration and customs inspections of Hong Kong before boarding a cross-border train or alighting from such a train. There are currently three cross-border train services on the conventional line:
* Between Hong Kong and Beijing (Beijing–Kowloon through train)
* Between Hong Kong and Shanghai (Shanghai–Kowloon through train)
* Between Hong Kong and Guangzhou (Guangzhou–Kowloon through train)

A new border-crossing service, the Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link, has been approved and has been granted HKD 6.6 billion in funding by the Legislative Council&#x27;s Finance Committee. The line has been opened in 2018 with a new station West Kowloon Terminus in the city centre.

====Taiwan====

Taiwan&#x27;s coastline is connected by frequent inter-city train services by Taiwan Railway Administration. Taiwan High Speed Rail, opened in 2007, covers the most populated west-coast corridor. Chinese：對號列車

There are Chu-kuang express (莒光號) and Tze-chiang limited express (自強號).

====South Korea====
Almost every major town and city in South Korea is linked by railway, run by Korail. ITX-Saemaeul is operated in most Main railway lines like Japanese limited express or German Intercity. Also, Mugunghwa-ho is the most common and most popular type of intercity rail travel like German Regional-Express. In addition, Seoul and Busan are linked by a high-speed train line known as KTX, which was built using French TGV technology.

====South Asia====
====Bangladesh====
====India====

India&#x27;s inter-city trains are run by Indian Railways. With of rail routes and 7,308 stations, the railway network in India is the third-largest in the world (after Russia and China) and the largest in the world in terms of passenger kilometres. The Vande Bharat Express, Gatimaan Express, Tejas Express, Tejas-Rajdhani Express, Rajdhani Express, Shatabdi Express, Jan Shatabdi Express and Duronto Express are the fastest inter-city services in India; of these, the Vande Bharat is the fastest one. All long-distance journeys generally require a reservation, although unreserved travel is allowed in some trains.

====Pakistan====
====Sri Lanka====
====Southeast Asia====
====Burma====
====Cambodia====
There is only one train service in Cambodia, from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville, stopping at Doun Kaev (Takeo) and Kampot.

====Indonesia====

In Indonesia, PT Kereta Api operates inter-city services between some of the country&#x27;s major cities, like Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Surabaya, Medan, Padang, and Palembang. In Jakarta metropolitan area (or Jabodetabek), KRL Jabotabek operates inter-city and commuter services. Indonesia also currently operates Southeast Asia&#x27;s first high-speed rail line, from Jakarta to Bandung.

====Laos====

In recent years construction has started on a China-funded higher-speed railway link, the Boten–Vientiane railway, commonly referred to as the China-Laos Railway. A fully electrified higher-speed railway line, it is part of a long-term goal of connecting China with the rest of Southeast Asia. The line runs from Boten near the China-Laos border to Vientiane, the capital of Laos, using CRRC high/higher-speed EMU trains.

====Malaysia====
Keretapi Tanah Melayu (Malayan Railways) operates loco-hauled express trains called KTM Intercity along Peninsular Malaysia and into Singapore. At the Malaysia–Thailand border, connections to State Railway of Thailand trains are available. KTM Intercity trains are diesel-powered and run on a single-track system. The rail track is gradually being duplicated and electrified. On the completed Central to Northern section (border), KTM runs the higher-speed Electric Train Service (ETS).

====Philippines====

As of February 2020, the Philippine National Railways does not have a regular inter-city rail service although the agency is planning on rebuilding new railway lines. Prior to the 1970s, the main island of Luzon had a relatively expansive narrow-gauge railway network, but government prioritization towards highway construction and the effects of multiple natural disasters gradually led to the decline and abandonment of most intercity rail services. Until the 2000s, PNR had two inter-city rail services: the Bicol Express and the Mayon Limited. The Bicol Express leaves Manila and passes through Manila, Pasay, and Muntinlupa and the provinces of Laguna, Quezon, and Camarines Sur before arriving at Naga. The trip takes 10 hours, or 600 minutes. The Mayon Limited connects Minola and Ligao in hours. The Philippine government is planning the revival of inter-city rail with projects such as the PNR South Long Haul which aims to reconstruct the railway in Southern Luzon.

====Thailand====

Thailand has a sizable meter-gauge intercity rail network radiating outwards from Bangkok, transporting around 60 million passengers every year. Construction is underway to connect Bangkok with Nakhon Ratchasima using a dedicated high speed rail line.

====Vietnam====
Trains in Vietnam, run by Vietnam Railways, link Hanoi, Hué, Da Nang, Nha Trang, and Ho Chi Minh City.

====Southwest Asia====
====Iran====
====Israel====
Israel Railways operates inter-city services between all the four major metropolitan areas of Israel: Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Be&#x27;er Sheva, and Haifa. However, due to the small geography of Israel, most of the railway services have a more suburban service pattern, with many short stops at stations between the major city centres.

===Europe===
====Western and Central Europe====
In Europe, many long-distance inter-city trains are operated under the InterCity (often simply IC) brand. &quot;InterCity&quot; (or, initially, &quot;Inter-City&quot; with a hyphen) was first conceived as a brand name by British Rail for the launch of its electrification of the major part of the West Coast Main Line in 1966, which brought new express services between London and the major cities of Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool. It later became the name of one of British Rail&#x27;s new business sectors in the 1980s and was used to describe the whole network of main-line passenger routes in Great Britain, but it went out of official use following privatisation. The introduction of the British Rail Class 43 (HST) helped InterCity become a familiar brand in the 1970s.

The principal network of international express trains in continental Europe is called EuroCity, even though some InterCity trains also cross borders.

High-speed railways have relatively few stops. The German high-speed train service was named InterCityExpress, indicating its evolution from older InterCity trains. Other high-speed lines include the TGV (France), AVE (Spain), Treno Alta Velocità (Italy), Eurostar (United Kingdom–France and Belgium), Thalys (Netherlands–Belgium–Germany and France), Lyria (France-Switzerland), and Railjet (Germany-Austria–Czechia/Hungary).

====Great Britain====

In Great Britain, the inter-city rail links are now operated by a number of private companies as well as Continental State owned railways such as Avanti West Coast, LNER, EMR, CrossCountry, TransPennine Express, Greater Anglia and GWR. Ireland&#x27;s inter-city rail network is maintained by Iarnród Éireann and Northern Ireland&#x27;s is run by Northern Ireland Railways.

====Italy====

With the introduction of high-speed trains, intercity trains are limited to few services per day on mainline and regional tracks.

The daytime services (&quot;InterCity&quot; IC), while not frequent and limited to one or two trains per route, are essential in providing access to cities and towns off the railway&#x27;s mainline network. The main routes are Trieste to Rome (stopping at Venice, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Milan to Rome (stopping at Genoa, La Spezia, Pisa and Livorno / stopping at Parma, Modena, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Bologna to Lecce (stopping at Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi) and Rome to Reggio di Calabria (stopping at Latina and Naples). In addition, the Intercity trains provide a more economical means of long-distance rail travel within Italy.

The night trains (&quot;Intercity Notte&quot; ICN) have sleeper compartments and washrooms, but no showers on board. Main routes are Rome to Bolzano/Bozen (calling at Florence, Bologna, Verona, Rovereto and Trento), Milan to Lecce (calling at Piacenza, Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, Faenza, Forlì, Cesena, Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi), Turin to Lecce (calling at Alessandria, Voghera, Piacenza, Parma, Bologna, Rimini, Pescara, Termoli, San Severo,Foggia, Barletta, Bisceglie, Molfetta, Bari, Monopoli, Fasano, Ostuni and Brindisi) and Reggio di Calabria to Turin (calling at Naples, Rome, Livorno, La Spezia and Genova). Most portions of these ICN services run during the night; since most services take 10 to 15 hours to complete a one-way journey, their day-time portion provide extra train connections to complement with the Intercity services.

====Central and Eastern Europe====
====Poland====

The Polish State Railways (PKP), a state-owned corporate group, is the main provider of railway services. The PKP group holds an almost unrivaled monopoly over rail services in Poland since it is both supported and partly funded by the national government.

As of 2018, foreign services operate on the Polish Railways network. These include EuroCity and EuroNight trains operating between Western and Eastern European destinations, including by the EN 440/441 from Berlin via Warsaw to Moscow operated by Talgo train of Russian Railways company.

In 2019, new nightjet train from Vienna to Berlin via Ostrava (CZ) and Wrocław (PL) starts the service. .

====Russia====
Russia has a dense network of long-distance railways all over its vast territory, the longest and most famous being the Trans-Siberian Railway from Moscow to Vladivostok. Long-distance train routes of more than are common, with many trips taking two or three days. Speed is relatively low: trains average .

===North America===
====Canada====
Canada&#x27;s inter-city trains are mostly run by Via Rail, a Canadian crown corporation mandated to operate inter-city passenger rail service in Canada. The majority of its services connect major cities in the most populous part of the country known as the Quebec City - Windsor Corridor, straddling the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It also operates long-distance trains to western Canada and the Maritimes on the Canadian and Ocean lines and by smaller trains to more remote areas of Canada. Much like the United States, Canada previously had a larger intercity rail network prior to the 1970s; certain major cities such as Calgary and Regina lack connections to the extant Via Rail network, and passenger rail usage outside of the Quebec City - Windsor Corridor is infrequent and geared towards the tourism market.

International trains, run jointly by Amtrak and Via Rail, connect New York City with Toronto. Amtrak also operates the &quot;Adirondack&quot; between New York City and Montreal, and the Amtrak Cascades service linking Vancouver and Seattle. In addition, the White Pass and Yukon Route links Skagway and Whitehorse on an isolated northern route.

Other inter-city passenger rail operators include the Ontario Northland Railway, which operates passenger services between Cochrane and Moosonee in rural northern Ontario and luxury train operators such as the Royal Canadian Pacific and Rocky Mountaineer, which operate rail tours in Western Canada.

====Mexico====
In Mexico, the federal government discontinued almost all scheduled inter-city passenger trains in June 2001. Ferromex operates trains on three routes: Chihuahua City to Los Mochis, Torreón to Felipe Pescador, and Guadalajara to Amatitán. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has proposed intercity trains, including from Mexico City to Toluca (construction began 7 July 2014), the Peninsular train from Yucatán to Riviera Maya, and the Mexico-Querétaro high-speed train from Puebla to Tlaxcala and Mexico City with future expansion to Guadalajara. In recent years, passenger trains have seen a revival, with the construction of the tourist-oriented Tren Maya route traversing the Yucatan Peninsula.

====United States====
There was a dense system of inter-city railways in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After the decline of passenger railroads in North America in the 1960s, the inter-city lines decreased greatly and today the national system is far less dense. The most heavily used routes with the greatest ridership and schedule frequencies are in the Northeastern United States on Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor. About one in every three users of mass transit in the United States and two-thirds of the nation&#x27;s rail riders live in New York City. The two busiest passenger rail stations in the United States are Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal, both in Manhattan, New York City. Passenger rail outside the Northeast, Northwest, California, and the Chicago metropolitan area is infrequent and rarely used relative to networks in Europe and Japan.

Passenger lines in most of the United States are operated by the quasi-public corporation Amtrak. The separate Alaska Railroad, which is also government-owned, runs passenger trains in Alaska, and the privately owned Brightline rail service operates in Florida. The California High-Speed Rail system began construction in 2015 and aims to connect major job centers in California.

Multiple new rail corridors have been identified for private development throughout the country. These include the Brightline West corridor from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, California, the Texas Central Railway between Dallas and Houston in Texas, and others.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
In Australia, the national interstate network operated by Journey Beyond connects all mainland Australian capital cities except Canberra. However, it is catered towards the luxury tourism market. NSW TrainLink operates interstate services from Sydney to Canberra, Melbourne and Brisbane. Intrastate inter-city trains that traverse shorter distances are operated by V/Line, NSW TrainLink, Sydney Trains, Queensland Rail and Transwa. The fastest intercity trains in regular service have a top service speed of 160 km/h.

In Australia, electrified interurban commuter railway systems are used to connect urban areas separated by long distances and use heavy-rail equipment:

*In New South Wales, Sydney Trains operates an extensive interurban network of four main routes from Sydney. These run to Newcastle and the Central Coast, the Blue Mountains, the Southern Highlands and the South Coast. NSW TrainLink brand its interurban commuter services as &quot;Intercity&quot;.
*In Brisbane, QR&#x27;s City network operates a smaller interurban commuter network of three lines which connect Brisbane to the Gold Coast in the south, Caboolture and the Sunshine Coast in the north and Rosewood in the west.
*In Perth, an electric interurban rail line running down the middle of the Kwinana Freeway to serve Mandurah opened on 23 December 2007.

On these systems, services either run as limited-stop expresses in the suburban area or as shuttles terminating where the suburban lines end.

A large-scale non-electric project of four regional lines known as the Regional Fast Rail is operational in Victoria. Current interurban and intercity journeys outside the suburban area are often locomotive-hauled, particularly for longer distance services, due to Victoria&#x27;s lack of electrification outside of Melbourne.

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, there are currently three long-distance passenger services classed as inter-city: the Coastal Pacific, the Northern Explorer, and the TranzAlpine. Their slow average speed is limited by the rugged country traversed, particularly in the middle of the North Island, where the North Island Main Trunk has many sharp curves and steep gradients. Given these speeds, as well as the prioritization of the rail transport in New Zealand towards freight, these passenger services primarily cater the tourist market, similar to long-distance routes in Australia.

Other current commuter passenger services include the Capital Connection, Te Huia and the Wairarapa Connection. A network of regional and long-distance rail passenger services until the mid-twentieth century has largely been replaced by air or bus services.

===South America===
A few countries of South America were once interconnected by international train services, but today they are almost non-existent, with the noticeable exceptions of Argentina and Chile. Most governments in the continent have favored roads and automobile transportation since the mid-20th century.

====Argentina====
Argentina has inter-city services on a number of routes, run by Operadora Ferroviaria Sociedad del Estado. Trains in Argentina are experiencing a revival, since the government intends to re-establish long-distance passenger trains between major cities.

====Bolivia====
Inter-city train services in Bolivia are operated by two train companies: Eastern and Western. The western network runs daily trains from Oruro to Tupiza, with both espresso (fast) and WaraWara (slow) trains. The eastern rail hub is Santa Cruz de la Sierra, with connections to Puerto Suárez and Villamontes, and international lines to Brazil and Argentina.

====Brazil====
Brazil&#x27;s inter-city services operate on two routes, one from Vitória to Belo Horizonte (Vitória-Minas Railway) and another from Parauapebas to São Luís. A third service was proposed by São Paulo state government to operate from São Paulo to Americana.

====Chile====

Chile has inter-city services connecting Santiago to Chillán and occasionally to Temuco, run by Empresa de los Ferrocarriles del Estado. The fastest in Chile (and South America) is TerraSur, reaching around .

<text>Arie Luijendijk (anglicized as Arie Luyendyk; born 21 September 1953), nicknamed &quot;The Flying Dutchman,&quot; is a Dutch former auto racing driver, and winner of the 1990 and 1997 Indianapolis 500 races. He was inducted into the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame in 2009, and the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2014. 

Luyendyk won a total of seven Indy car races, including three in the CART series, all of them on ovals.

==Career==

Luyendyk started racing in the early 1970s, winning a number of Dutch national titles. In 1977, he won the European Super Vee championship, and switched to Formula Three. Further success eluded him until he moved to the United States in 1984, where he immediately won the Super Vee championship.

With the help of sponsor Provimi Veal, Luyendyk ran his first full Champ Car season in 1985, winning the rookie of the year title both for the season and the Indianapolis 500. Gaining additional sponsorship from Domino&#x27;s Pizza (and changing his racing number to 30, as at the time Domino&#x27;s guaranteed customers that delivery orders would arrive in 30 minutes or less), his first win in the series came five years later in 1990, at the most important race in the series, with a record average speed of 185.981 mph (299.307 km/h). Luyendyk won the 1990 Indianapolis 500 for Doug Shierson Racing. His average speed record, which stood for 23 years, was finally broken in the 2013 97th Indianapolis 500 by Tony Kanaan with an average speed of 187.433 mph (301.644 km/h).

Luyendyk continued to perform well at Indianapolis, scoring pole positions in 1993, 1997 and 1999, and retiring from the race while leading on three occasions. In 1995, Luyendyk controlled the race early until an incident with Scott Sharp put him several laps down. For the rest of the race, Luyendyk was able to make up all his laps and barely beat eventual winner Jacques Villeneuve at the stripe to get his final lap back and finish on the lead lap.

In 1996, he set the qualifying lap record at 237.498 mph (382.216 km/h), although he did not start on the pole because he qualified on the second day of time trials. He won the 1997 Indianapolis 500 from the pole over Treadway Racing teammate Scott Goodyear. The race ended in controversy when on the final restart the white and green flag waved to end a caution but the yellow lights stayed on with Luyendyk pulling away to the win while the other competitors were confused. A similar finish involving a similar mistake almost took away a win from Luyendyk two weeks later.

At the 1997 True Value 500 at Texas, a scoring error by the USAC resulted in Billy Boat being declared the race winner. Luyendyk protested in front of victory lane, only to be slapped by Boat&#x27;s team owner A. J. Foyt. Following the incident, Foyt and Luyendyk were fined 20,000 and 14,000 respectively, for unsportsmanlike behaviour. IndyCar officials reviewed the race tape and discovered that Luyendyk had actually finished on a lap by himself and completed more laps than the scheduled race distance, thus he was declared the official winner. Because Foyt refused to surrender the trophy, a duplicate was awarded to Luyendyk.

Luyendyk also was selected to participate in the 1992, 1993, and 1998 editions of the International Race of Champions.

After his terrific run in 1997, Luyendyk had a washout year the following season. He only won one race, and had several races where he didn&#x27;t finish the full distance. After 1998, Luyendyk decided to cut down to a part-time schedule, only racing in the 1999 Indianapolis 500 where he won the pole and dropped out because of a crash. He retired from racing after the 1999 season, and for a short time, joined ABC Sports as a color commentator. He returned to the Indy 500 in 2001 and 2002. In 2003, he entered at Indianapolis for the final time. He suffered a crash during practice, and did not make an attempt to qualify.

Other Luyendyk victories include the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring. His son, Arie Jr., is an off-road and Indy Lights racer.

The last corner of the Zandvoort track in the Netherlands carries his name. In 1999, he was presented with the Sagamore of the Wabash award, reflecting upon his Indy 500 career. In 2016, Luyendyk was selected as a chief steward for the IndyCar Series alongside fellow racer Max Papis and Dan Davis.

<text>The Three Mile Island accident was a partial nuclear meltdown of the Unit 2 reactor (TMI-2) of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, located on the Susquehanna River in Londonderry Township, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The reactor accident began at 4:00 a.m. on March 28, 1979, and released radioactive gases and radioactive iodine into the environment. It is the worst accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant history. On the seven-point logarithmic International Nuclear Event Scale, the TMI-2 reactor accident is rated Level5, an &quot;Accident with Wider Consequences&quot;.

The accident began with failures in the non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open pilot-operated relief valve (PORV) in the primary system, which allowed large amounts of water to escape from the pressurized isolated coolant loop. The mechanical failures were compounded by the initial failure of plant operators to recognize the situation as a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA). TMI training and operating procedures left operators and management ill-prepared for the deteriorating situation caused by the LOCA. During the accident, those inadequacies were compounded by design flaws, such as poor control design, the use of multiple similar alarms, and a failure of the equipment to indicate either the coolant-inventory level or the position of the stuck-open PORV.

The accident heightened anti-nuclear safety concerns among the general public and led to new regulations for the nuclear industry. It accelerated the decline of efforts to build new reactors. Anti-nuclear movement activists expressed worries about regional health effects from the accident. Some epidemiological studies analyzing the rate of cancer in and around the area since the accident did determine that there was a statistically significant increase in the rate of cancer, while other studies did not. Due to the nature of such studies, a causal connection linking the accident with cancer is difficult to prove. Cleanup at TMI-2 started in August 1979 and officially ended in December 1993, with a total cost of about $1 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ). TMI-1 was restarted in 1985, then retired in 2019 due to operating losses. It is expected to go back into service by 2028 as part of a deal with Microsoft to power its data centers.

==Accident==

===Background===

In the night hours before the incident, the TMI-2 reactor was running at 97% power while the companion TMI-1 reactor was shut down for refueling. The main chain of events leading to the partial core meltdown on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, began at 4:00:36 a.m. EST in TMI-2&#x27;s secondary loop, one of the three main water/steam loops in a pressurized water reactor.

The initial cause of the accident happened 11 hours earlier, during an attempt by operators to fix a blockage in one of the eight condensate polishers, the sophisticated filters cleaning the secondary loop water. These filters are designed to stop minerals and other impurities in the water from accumulating in the steam generators and to decrease corrosion rates on the secondary side.

Blockages are common with these resin filters and are usually fixed easily, but in this case, the usual method of forcing the stuck resin out with compressed air did not succeed. The operators decided to blow compressed air into the water and let the force of the water clear the resin. When they forced the resin out, a small amount of water forced its way past a stuck-open check valve and found its way into an instrument air line. This would eventually cause the feedwater pumps, condensate booster pumps, and condensate pumps to turn off around 4:00 a.m., which would, in turn, cause a turbine trip.

===Reactor overheating and malfunction of relief valve===
Given that the steam generators were no longer receiving feedwater, heat transfer from the reactor coolant system (RCS) was greatly reduced, and RCS temperature rose. The rapidly heating coolant expanded and surged into the pressurizer, compressing the steam bubble at the top. When RCS pressure rose to , the pilot-operated relief valve (PORV) opened, relieving steam through piping to the reactor coolant drain tank in the containment building basement. RCS pressure continued to rise, reaching the reactor protection system high-pressure trip setpoint of eight seconds after the turbine trip. The reactor automatically tripped, its control rods falling into the core under gravity, halting the nuclear chain reaction and stopping the heat generated by fission. However, the reactor continued to generate decay heat, initially equivalent to approximately 6% of the pre-trip power level. Because steam was no longer being used by the turbine and feed was not being supplied to the steam generators, heat removal from the reactor&#x27;s primary water loop was limited to steaming the small amount of water remaining in the secondary side of the steam generators to the condenser using turbine bypass valves.

When the feedwater pumps tripped, three emergency feedwater pumps started automatically. An operator noted that the pumps were running but did not notice that a block valve was closed in each of the two emergency feedwater lines, blocking emergency feed flow to both steam generators. The valve position lights for one block valve were covered by a yellow maintenance tag. The reason why the operator missed the lights for the second valve is not known, although one theory is that his own large belly hid it from his view. The valves may have been left closed during a surveillance test two days earlier. With the block valves closed, the system was unable to pump water. The closure of these valves was a violation of a key Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) rule, according to which the reactor must be shut down if all auxiliary feed pumps are closed for maintenance. This was later singled out by NRC officials as a key failure.

After the reactor tripped, secondary system steam valves operated to reduce steam generator temperature and pressure, cooling the RCS and lowering RCS temperature, as designed, resulting in a contraction of the primary coolant. With the coolant contraction and loss of coolant through the open PORV, RCS pressure dropped as did pressurizer level after peaking 15 seconds after the turbine trip. Also, 15 seconds after the turbine trip, coolant pressure had dropped to , the reset setpoint for the PORV. Electric power to the PORV&#x27;s solenoid was automatically cut, but the relief valve was stuck open with coolant water continuing to be released.

In post-accident investigations, the indication for the PORV was one of many design flaws identified in the operators&#x27; controls, instruments and alarms. There was no direct indication of the valve&#x27;s actual position. A light on a control panel, installed after the PORV had stuck open during startup testing, came on when the PORV opened. When that light—labeled &quot;Light on – RC-RV2 open&quot;—went out, the operators believed that the valve was closed. In fact, the light when on only indicated that the PORV pilot valve&#x27;s solenoid was powered, not the actual status of the PORV. While the main relief valve was stuck open, the operators believed the unlighted lamp meant the valve was shut. As a result, they did not correctly diagnose the problem for several hours.

The operators had not been trained to understand the ambiguous nature of the PORV indicator and to look for alternative confirmation that the main relief valve was closed. A downstream temperature indicator, the sensor for which was located in the tail pipe between the pilot-operated relief valve and the pressurizer relief tank, could have hinted at a stuck valve had operators noticed its higher-than-normal reading. It was not, however, part of the &quot;safety grade&quot; suite of indicators designed to be used after an incident, and personnel had not been trained to use it. Its location behind the seven-foot-high instrument panel also meant that it was effectively out of sight.

===Depressurization of primary reactor cooling system===
Less than a minute after the beginning of the event, the water level in the pressurizer began to rise, even though RCS pressure was falling. With the PORV stuck open, coolant was being lost from the RCS, a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA). Expected symptoms for a LOCA were drops in both RCS pressure and pressurizer level. The operators&#x27; training and plant procedures did not cover a situation where the two parameters went in opposite directions. The water level in the pressurizer was rising because the steam in the space at the top of the pressurizer was being vented through the stuck-open PORV, lowering the pressure in the pressurizer because of the lost inventory. The lowering of pressure in the pressurizer made water from the coolant loop surge in and created a steam bubble in the reactor pressure vessel head, aided by the decay heat from the fuel. 

This steam bubble was invisible for the operators, and this mechanism had not been trained. Indications of high water levels in the pressurizer contributed to confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop &quot;going solid&quot;, (i.e., no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a LOCA and led operators to turn off the emergency core cooling pumps, which had automatically started after the PORV stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.

With the PORV still open, the pressurizer relief tank that collected the discharge from the PORV overfilled, causing the containment building sump to fill and sound an alarm at 4:11 a.m. This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the PORV discharge line and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications that there was an ongoing LOCA, but these indications were initially ignored by operators. At 4:15 a.m., the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer relief tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak into the general containment building. This radioactive coolant was pumped from the containment building sump to an auxiliary building, outside the main containment, until the sump pumps were stopped at 4:39 a.m.

===Partial meltdown and further release of radioactive substances===
At about 5:20a.m., after almost 80 minutes with a growing steam bubble in the reactor pressure vessel head, the primary loop&#x27;s four main reactor coolant pumps began to cavitate as a steam bubble/water mixture, rather than water, passed through them. The pumps were shut down, and it was believed that natural circulation would continue the water movement. Steam in the system prevented flow through the core, and as the water stopped circulating it was converted to steam in increasing amounts. Soon after 6:00a.m., the top of the reactor core was exposed, and the intense heat caused a reaction to occur between the steam forming in the reactor core and the zircaloy nuclear fuel rod cladding, yielding zirconium dioxide, hydrogen, and additional heat. This reaction melted the nuclear fuel rod cladding and damaged the fuel pellets, which released radioactive isotopes to the reactor coolant and produced hydrogen gas that is believed to have caused a small explosion in the containment building later that afternoon.

At 6:00 a.m. there was a shift change in the control room. A new arrival noticed that the temperatures in the PORV tail pipe and the holding tanks were excessive, and used a backup—called a block valve—to shut off the coolant venting via the PORV, but around of coolant had already leaked from the primary loop. It was not until 6:45a.m., 165 minutes after the start of the problem, that radiation alarms activated when the contaminated water reached detectors; by that time, the radiation levels in the primary coolant water were around 300 times expected levels, and the general containment building was seriously contaminated with radiation levels of 800 rem/h.

==Emergency declaration and immediate aftermath==

At 6:56a.m. a plant supervisor declared a site area emergency, and less than 30 minutes later station manager Gary Miller announced a general emergency. Metropolitan Edison (Met Ed) notified the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, which in turn contacted state and local agencies, Pennsylvania Governor Richard L. Thornburgh and Lieutenant Governor William Scranton III, to whom Thornburgh assigned responsibility for collecting and reporting on information about the accident. The uncertainty of operators at the plant was reflected in fragmentary, ambiguous, or contradictory statements made by Met Ed to government agencies and to the press, particularly about the possibility and severity of off-site radioactivity releases.

Scranton held a press conference in which he was reassuring, yet confused, about this possibility, stating that though there had been a &quot;small release of radiation...no increase in normal radiation levels&quot; had been detected. These were contradicted by another official, and by statements from Met Ed, who both claimed that no radioactivity had been released. Readings from instruments at the plant and off-site detectors had detected radioactivity releases, albeit at levels that were unlikely to threaten public health as long as they were temporary, and providing that containment of the then highly contaminated reactor was maintained.

Angry that Met Ed had not informed them before conducting a steam venting from the plant, and convinced that the company was downplaying the severity of the accident, state officials turned to the NRC. After receiving word of the accident from Met Ed, the NRC had activated its emergency response headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, and sent staff members to Three Mile Island. NRC chairman Joseph Hendrie and commissioner Victor Gilinsky initially viewed the accident as a &quot;cause for concern but not alarm&quot;. 

Gilinsky briefed reporters and members of Congress on the situation and informed White House staff, and at 10:00 a.m. met with two other commissioners. However, the NRC faced the same problems in obtaining accurate information as the state and was further hampered by being organizationally ill-prepared to deal with emergencies, as it lacked a clear command structure and did not have the authority either to tell the utility what to do or to order an evacuation of the local area.

In a 2009 article, Gilinsky wrote that it took five weeks to learn that &quot;the reactor operators had measured fuel temperatures near the melting point&quot;. He further wrote: &quot;We didn&#x27;t learn for years—until the reactor vessel was physically opened—that by the time the plant operator called the NRC at about 8:00 a.m., roughly half of the uranium fuel had already melted.&quot;

It was still not clear to the control room staff that the primary loop water levels were low and that over half of the core was exposed. A group of workers took manual readings from the thermocouples and obtained a sample of primary loop water. Seven hours into the emergency, new water was pumped into the primary loop and the backup relief valve was opened to reduce pressure so that the loop could be filled with water. After 16 hours, the primary loop pumps were turned on once again, and the core temperature began to fall. A large part of the core had melted, and the system was dangerously radioactive.

On the day following the accident, March 29, control room operators needed to ensure the integrity of the reactor vessel. In order to do this, someone needed to draw a boron concentration sample in order to ensure there was enough of it in the primary system to shut down the reactor entirely. Unit 2&#x27;s chemistry supervisor, Edward &quot;Ed&quot; Houser, volunteered to draw the sample after his co-workers were hesitant. Shift supervisor Richard Dubiel asked Pete Velez, the radiation protection foreman for Unit 2, to join Houser. Velez would monitor airborne radiation levels and ensure that no overexposure would occur for either of them.

Wearing excessive amounts of protective clothing—three pairs of gloves, one pair of rubber boots and a respirator—the two navigated the reactor auxiliary building to draw the sample. However, Houser had lost his pocket dosimeter while taking measurements. Houser had noted the sample he drew looked &quot;like Alka-Seltzer&quot; and was highly radioactive, with readings as high as 1,000 rem/h. The two spent five minutes in the building, then withdrew. Houser had gone past the NRC&#x27;s quarterly dose limit for radiation exposure (3 rem/qtr in 1979) by one and was only admitted back to work the following quarter.

On the third day following the accident, a hydrogen bubble was discovered in the dome of the pressure vessel and became the focus of concern. A hydrogen explosion could breach the pressure vessel and, depending on its magnitude, might compromise the integrity of the containment building leading to a large-scale release of radioactive material. However, it was determined that there was no oxygen present in the pressure vessel, a prerequisite for hydrogen to burn or explode. Immediate steps were taken to reduce the hydrogen bubble, and by the following day it was significantly smaller. Over the next week, steam and hydrogen were removed from the reactor using a catalytic recombiner and by venting directly into the open air.

===Identification of released radioactive material===

The release occurred when the cladding was damaged while the PORV was still stuck open. Fission products were released into the reactor coolant. Since the PORV was stuck open and the loss of coolant accident was still in progress, primary coolant with fission products and/or fuel was released and ultimately ended up in the auxiliary building. The auxiliary building was outside the containment boundary.

This was evidenced by the radiation alarms that eventually sounded. However, since very little of the fission products released were solids at room temperature, very little radiological contamination was reported in the environment. No significant level of radiation was attributed to the TMI-2 accident outside of the TMI-2 facility. According to the Rogovin report, the vast majority of the radioisotopes released were noble gases xenon and krypton resulting in an average dose of to the two million people near the plant. In comparison, a patient receives from a chest X-ray—more than twice the average dose of those received near the plant. On average, a U.S. resident receives an annual radiation exposure from natural sources of about .

Within hours of the accident, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began daily sampling of the environment at the three stations closest to the plant. Continuous monitoring at 11 stations was established on April 1 and was expanded to 31 stations on April 3. An inter-agency analysis concluded that the accident did not raise radioactivity far enough above background levels to cause even one additional cancer death among the people in the area, but measures of beta radiation were not included because the EPA found no contamination in water, soil, sediment, or plant samples.

Researchers at nearby Dickinson College—which had radiation monitoring equipment sensitive enough to detect Chinese atmospheric atomic weapons-testing—collected soil samples from the area for the ensuing two weeks and detected no elevated levels of radioactivity, except after rainfalls (likely from natural radon plate-out, not the accident). Also, the tongues of white-tailed deer harvested over from the reactor subsequent to the accident were found to have significantly higher levels of cesium-137 than in deer in the counties immediately surrounding the power plant. Even then, the elevated levels were still below those seen in deer in other parts of the country during the height of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. Had there been elevated releases of radioactivity, increased levels of iodine-131 and cesium-137 would have been expected to be detected in cattle and goat&#x27;s milk samples. Elevated levels were not found. A later study noted that the official emission figures were consistent with available dosimeter data, though others have noted the incompleteness of this data, particularly for releases early on.

== Kemeny Commission ==
Several state and federal government agencies mounted investigations into the crisis, the most prominent of which was the &quot;President&#x27;s Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island&quot;, created by U.S. President Jimmy Carter in April 1979. The commission consisted of a panel of 12 people, specifically chosen for their lack of strong pro- or anti-nuclear views, and headed by chairman John G. Kemeny, president of Dartmouth College. It was instructed to produce a final report within six months, and after public hearings, depositions, and document collection, released a completed study on October 31, 1979.

According to the official figures, as compiled by the 1979 Kemeny Commission from Met Ed and NRC data, a maximum of of radioactive noble gases, primarily xenon, were released by the event. These noble gases were considered relatively harmless, and only of thyroid cancer-causing iodine-131 were released. Total releases according to these figures were a relatively small proportion of the estimated in the reactor. It was later found that about half the core had melted, and the cladding around 90% of the fuel rods had failed, with of the core gone, and around of uranium flowing to the bottom head of the pressure vessel, forming a mass of corium. The reactor vessel—the second level of containment after the cladding—maintained integrity and contained the damaged fuel with nearly all of the radioactive isotopes in the core.

Anti-nuclear political groups disputed the Kemeny Commission&#x27;s findings, claiming that other independent measurements provided evidence of radiation levels up to seven times higher than normal in locations hundreds of miles downwind from TMI. Arnie Gundersen, a former nuclear industry executive and anti-nuclear advocate, said &quot;I think the numbers on the NRC&#x27;s website are off by a factor of 100 to 1,000&quot;. Gundersen offers evidence, based on pressure monitoring data, for a hydrogen explosion shortly before 2:00 p.m. on March 28, 1979, which would have provided the means for a high dose of radiation to occur. Gundersen cites affidavits from four reactor operators according to which the plant manager was aware of a dramatic pressure spike, after which the internal pressure dropped to outside pressure. Gundersen also claimed that the control room shook and doors were blown off hinges. However, official NRC reports refer merely to a &quot;hydrogen burn&quot;.

The Kemeny Commission referred to &quot;a burn or an explosion that caused pressure to increase by in the containment building&quot;, while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;At about 2:00 pm, with pressure almost down to the point where the huge cooling pumps could be brought into play, a small hydrogen explosion jolted the reactor.&quot; Work performed for the Department of Energy in the 1980s determined that the hydrogen burn (deflagration), which went essentially unnoticed for the first few days, occurred 9 hours and 50 minutes after initiation of the accident, had a duration of 12 to 15 seconds and did not involve a detonation.

The investigation strongly criticized Babcock &amp; Wilcox, Met Ed, General Public Utilities, and the NRC for lapses in quality assurance and maintenance, inadequate operator training, lack of communication of important safety information, poor management, and complacency, but avoided drawing conclusions about the future of the nuclear industry. The heaviest criticism from the Kemeny Commission said that &quot;... fundamental changes will be necessary in the organization, procedures, and practices—and above all—in the attitudes&quot; of the NRC and the nuclear industry. Kemeny said that the actions taken by the operators were &quot;inappropriate&quot; but that the workers &quot;were operating under procedures that they were required to follow, and our review and study of those indicates that the procedures were inadequate&quot; and that the control room &quot;was greatly inadequate for managing an accident&quot;.

The Kemeny Commission noted that Babcock &amp; Wilcox&#x27;s PORV had previously failed on 11 occasions, nine of them in the open position, allowing coolant to escape. The initial causal sequence of events at TMI had been duplicated 18 months earlier at another Babcock &amp; Wilcox reactor, the Davis–Besse Nuclear Power Station. The only differences were that the operators at Davis–Besse identified the valve failure after 20 minutes, where at TMI it took 80 minutes, and the fact that the Davis–Besse facility was operating at 9% power, against TMI&#x27;s 97%. Although Babcock engineers recognized the problem, the company failed to clearly notify its customers of the valve issue.

The Pennsylvania House of Representatives conducted its own investigation, which focused on the need to improve evacuation procedures.

In 1985, a television camera was used to see the interior of the damaged reactor. In 1986, core samples and samples of debris were obtained from the corium layers on the bottom of the reactor vessel and analyzed.

== Mitigation policies ==

===Voluntary evacuation===
On Wednesday, March 28, hours after the accident began, Lieutenant Governor Scranton appeared at a news briefing to say that Met Ed had assured the state that &quot;everything is under control&quot;. Later that day, Scranton changed his statement, saying that the situation was &quot;more complex than the company first led us to believe&quot;. There were conflicting statements about radioactivity releases. Schools were closed, and residents were urged to stay indoors. Farmers were told to keep their animals under cover and on stored feed.

Governor Thornburgh, on the advice of NRC chairman Joseph Hendrie, advised the evacuation &quot;of pregnant women and pre-school age children...within a five-mile radius of the Three Mile Island facility&quot;. The evacuation zone was extended to a 20-mile radius on March 30. Within days, 140,000 people had left the area. More than half of the population within the 20-mile radius remained in that area. According to a survey conducted in April 1979, 98% of the evacuees had returned to their homes within three weeks.

Post-TMI surveys have shown that less than 50% of the American public were satisfied with the way the accident was handled by Pennsylvania state officials and the NRC, and people surveyed were even less pleased with the utility (General Public Utilities) and the plant designer.

===Effect on nuclear power industry===

According to the IAEA, the Three Mile Island accident was a significant turning point in the global development of nuclear power. From 1963 to 1979, the number of reactors under construction globally increased every year except in 1971 and 1978. However, following the event, the number of reactors under construction in the U.S. declined from 1980 to 1998, with increasing construction costs and delayed completion dates for some reactors. Many similar Babcock &amp; Wilcox reactors on order were canceled. In total, 52 U.S. nuclear reactors were canceled between 1980 and 1984.

The accident did not initiate the demise of the U.S. nuclear power industry, but it did halt its historic growth. Additionally, as a result of the earlier 1973 oil crisis and post-crisis analysis with conclusions of potential overcapacity in base load, 40 planned nuclear power plants already had been canceled before the accident. At the time of the incident, 129 nuclear power plants had been approved, but of those, only 53 which were not already operating were completed. During the lengthy review process, complicated by the Chernobyl disaster seven years later, federal requirements to correct safety issues and design deficiencies became more stringent, local opposition became more strident, construction times were significantly lengthened and costs skyrocketed. Until 2012, no U.S. nuclear power plant had been authorized to begin construction since the year before, 1978. Globally, the end of the increase in nuclear power plant construction came with the more catastrophic Chernobyl disaster in 1986 (see graph).

===Cleanup===

Initially, GPU planned to repair the reactor and return it into service. However, TMI-2 was too badly damaged and contaminated to resume operations; the reactor was gradually deactivated and permanently closed. TMI-2 had been online for only three months but now had a ruined reactor vessel and a containment building that was unsafe to walk in. Cleanup started in August 1979 and officially ended in December 1993, with a total cleanup cost of about $1 billion. Benjamin K. Sovacool, in his 2007 preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, estimated that the TMI accident caused a total of $2.4 billion in property damages.

Efforts focused on the cleanup and decontamination of the site, especially the defueling of the damaged reactor. Starting in 1985, almost of radioactive fuel were removed from the site. Planning and work was partially hampered by too-optimistic views about the damage.

In 1988, the NRC announced that, although it was possible to further decontaminate the Unit 2 site, the remaining radioactivity had been sufficiently contained as to pose no threat to public health and safety. The first major phase of the cleanup was completed in 1990, when workers finished shipping of radioactive wreckage to Idaho for storage at the Department of Energy&#x27;s National Engineering Laboratory. However, the contaminated cooling water that leaked into the containment building had seeped into the building&#x27;s concrete, leaving the radioactive residue too impractical to remove. Accordingly, further cleanup efforts were deferred to allow for decay of the radiation levels and to take advantage of the potential economic benefits of retiring both Unit 1 and Unit 2 together.

===Health effects and epidemiology===

In the aftermath of the accident, investigations focused on the amount of radioactivity released. In total, approximately of radioactive gases and approximately of iodine-131 were released into the environment. According to the American Nuclear Society, using the official radioactivity emission figures, &quot;The average radiation dose to people living within 10 miles of the plant was eight millirem (0.08 mSv), and no more than 100 millirem (1 mSv) to any single individual. Eight millirem is about equal to a chest X-ray, and 100 millirem is about a third of the average background level of radiation received by US residents in a year.&quot;

According to health researcher Joseph Mangano, early scientific publications estimated no additional cancer deaths in the area around TMI, based on these numbers. Disease rates in areas farther than 10 miles from the plant were not examined. Local activism in the 1980s, based on anecdotal reports of negative health effects, led to scientific studies being commissioned. A variety of epidemiology studies have concluded that the accident had no observable long-term health effects.

A peer-reviewed research article by Dr. Steven Wing found a significant increase in cancers between 1979 and 1985 among people who lived within ten miles of TMI. In 2009, Dr. Wing stated that radiation releases during the accident were probably &quot;thousands of times greater&quot; than the NRC&#x27;s estimates. A retrospective study of the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry found an increased incidence of thyroid cancer in some counties south of TMI (although, notably, not in Dauphin County where the reactor was located) and in high-risk age groups but did not draw a causal link between these incidences and the accident. The Talbott lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported finding a few, small increased cancer risks within the TMI population. A more recent study reached &quot;findings consistent with observations from other radiation-exposed populations,&quot; raising &quot;the possibility that radiation released from [Three Mile Island] may have altered the molecular profile of [thyroid cancer] in the population surrounding TMI&quot;, establishing a potential causal mechanism, although not definitively proving causation.

The Radiation and Public Health Project, an organization with little credibility among epidemiologists, cited calculations by Mangano that showed a spike in infant mortality in downwind communities two years after the accident. Anecdotal evidence also records effects on the region&#x27;s wildlife. John Gofman used his own, non-peer reviewed low-level radiation health model to predict 333 excess cancer or leukemia deaths from the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. The ongoing TMI epidemiological research has been accompanied by a discussion of problems in dose estimates due to a lack of accurate data, as well as illness classifications.

===Activism and legal action===
The accident enhanced the perceived credibility of anti-nuclear groups and triggered protests around the world. President Carter—who had specialized in nuclear power while in the United States Navy—told his cabinet after visiting the plant that the accident was minor but reportedly declined to do so in public, in order to avoid offending Democrats who opposed nuclear power.

Members of the American public, concerned about the release of radioactive gas from the accident, staged numerous anti-nuclear demonstrations across the country in the following months. The largest demonstration was held in New York City in September 1979 and involved 200,000 people, with speeches given by Jane Fonda and Ralph Nader. The New York rally was held in conjunction with a series of nightly &quot;No Nukes&quot; concerts given at Madison Square Garden from September 19 to 23 by Musicians United for Safe Energy. In the previous May, an estimated 65,000 people—including California Governor Jerry Brown—attended a march and rally against nuclear power in Washington, D.C.

In 1981, citizens&#x27; groups succeeded in a class action suit against TMI, winning $25 million in an out-of-court settlement. Part of this money was used to found the TMI Public Health Fund. In 1983, a federal grand jury indicted Metropolitan Edison on criminal charges for the falsification of safety test results prior to the accident. Under a plea-bargaining agreement, Met Ed pleaded guilty to one count of falsifying records and no contest to six other charges, four of which were dropped, and agreed to pay a $45,000 fine and set up a $1 million account to help with emergency planning in the area surrounding the plant.

According to Eric Epstein, chair of Three Mile Island Alert, the TMI plant operator and its insurers paid at least $82 million in publicly documented compensation to residents for &quot;loss of business revenue, evacuation expenses and health claims.&quot; However, a class action lawsuit alleging that the accident caused detrimental health effects was rejected by Harrisburg United States district court Judge Sylvia Rambo, and the final appeal of that decision failed in 2002.

===Normal accident theory===
The Three Mile Island accident inspired Charles Perrow&#x27;s normal accident theory, which attempts to describe &quot;unanticipated interactions of multiple failures in a complex system&quot;. TMI was an example of this type of accident because it was &quot;unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable.&quot;

Perrow concluded that the failure at Three Mile Island was a consequence of the system&#x27;s immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a &#x27;normal accident&#x27;. Therefore, he suggested, we might do better to contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely.

&quot;Normal&quot; accidents, or system accidents, are so called by Perrow because such accidents are inevitable in extremely complex systems. Given the characteristic of the system involved, multiple failures that interact with each other will occur, despite efforts to avoid them. Events which appear trivial initially cascade and multiply unpredictably, creating a much larger catastrophic event.

&quot;Normal Accidents&quot; contributed key concepts to a set of intellectual developments in the 1980s that revolutionized the conception of safety and risk. It made the case for examining technological failures as the product of highly interacting systems, and highlighted organizational and management factors as the main causes of failures. Technological disasters could no longer be ascribed to isolated equipment malfunction, operator error or acts of God.

===Comparison to U.S. Navy operations===
After the TMI incident, President Carter commissioned a study, &quot;Report of the President&#x27;s Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island&quot; (1979).

Admiral Hyman G. Rickover was later asked to tell Congress why naval nuclear propulsion (as used in submarines) had suffered no reactor accidents, defined as the uncontrolled release of fission products to the environment resulting from damage to a reactor core. In his testimony, Rickover said:

Over the years, many people have asked me how I run the Naval Reactors Program, so that they might find some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the tendency of people to expect that I have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.

== 21st century status ==
After the incident at TMI-2, the NRC suspended the license to operate TMI-1, which was owned and operated by Met Ed, one of General Public Utilities Corporation&#x27;s regional utility operating companies. In 1982, the citizens of the three counties surrounding the site voted overwhelmingly in a non-binding resolution to retire Unit 1 permanently. In 1985, a 4–1 vote by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission allowed TMI-1 to resume operations. 

GPU formed General Public Utilities Nuclear Corporation as a subsidiary to own and operate the company&#x27;s nuclear facilities, including Three Mile Island. In 1996, General Public Utilities shortened its name to GPU Inc. In 1998, GPU sold TMI-1 to AmerGen Energy Corporation, a joint venture between Philadelphia Electric Company and British Energy. (GPU was legally obliged to continue to maintain and monitor TMI-2.) In 2001, GPU was acquired by FirstEnergy Corporation and dissolved, and the maintenance and administration of Unit 2 was contracted to AmerGen.

In 2000, Philadelphia Electric merged with Unicom Corporation to form Exelon. In 2003, Exelon bought the remaining shares of AmerGen from British Energy. In 2009, Exelon Nuclear absorbed and dissolved AmerGen. Along with TMI Unit 1, Exelon Nuclear operates Clinton Power Station and several other nuclear facilities.

Unit 2 continues to be licensed and regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in a condition known as Post Defueling Monitored Storage. The TMI-2 reactor has been permanently shut down with the reactor coolant system drained, the radioactive water decontaminated and evaporated, radioactive waste shipped off-site, reactor fuel and most core debris shipped off-site to a Department of Energy facility, and the remainder of the site being monitored. The owner planned to keep the facility in long-term, monitoring storage until the operating license for the TMI-1 plant expired, at which time both plants would be decommissioned.

In 2009, the NRC granted a license extension which allowed the TMI-1 reactor to operate until April 19, 2034. In 2017, it was announced that operations would cease by 2019 due to financial pressure from inexpensive natural gas, unless lawmakers stepped in to keep it open. When it became clear that the subsidy legislation would not pass, Exelon decided to retire the plant. TMI Unit 1 shut down on September 20, 2019. Following the permanent shutdown, Unit 1 is in decommissioning, moving to SAFSTOR status. 

In 2020 the site was purchased by TMI-2 solutions, a subsidiary of EnergySolutions, with the intent of cleaning up the site for less money than is available in a dedicated fund. On May 8, 2023, TMI-2 solutions announced that 99% of the nuclear fuel has been cleaned up and that the site has entered the next phase of clean-up that will last until 2029. TMI-2 solutions plans to finish clean-up and demolish the plant by 2052.

In September 2024, Constellation Energy announced plans to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to sell the power to Microsoft, demonstrating the immense power needs of the tech sector as they build data centers to support artificial intelligence. Constellation expects the Unit 1 reactor at Three Mile Island to come back online in 2028, subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Constellation also plans to apply to extend the plant’s operations to at least 2054. 

==Timeline==
==In popular culture==
On March 15, 1979, twelve days before the accident, the movie &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; premiered and was initially met with backlash from the nuclear power industry, claiming it to be &quot;sheer fiction&quot; and a &quot;character assassination of an entire industry&quot;. In the film, television reporter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) secretly film a major accident at a nuclear power plant while taping a series on nuclear power. At one point in the film, an official tells Wells that an explosion at the plant &quot;could render an area the size of the state of Pennsylvania permanently uninhabitable&quot;. After the release of the film, Fonda began lobbying against nuclear power. In an attempt to counter her efforts, Edward Teller (nuclear physicist, government science adviser, and contributor to the Teller–Ulam thermonuclear bomb design), personally lobbied in favor of nuclear power. Teller suffered a heart attack shortly after the incident and joked that he was the only person whose health was affected.

Three Mile Island and the associated incident features in the UK Channel 4 show &quot;Utopia&quot;.

The 2009 superhero film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; portrays Three Mile Island in the 1970s serving as a mutant prison run by the film&#x27;s main antagonist William Stryker and his team of scientists, where they experimented on and combined the mutants&#x27; powers for the Weapon X and Weapon XI programs. The film portrays the 1979 accident being caused by the destruction from a battle between the characters Wolverine, Sabretooth, and Deadpool.

The Three Mile Island accident plays a pivotal role in &quot;Heat and Light&quot;, a 2016 novel by Jennifer Haigh.

&quot;Meltdown: Three Mile Island&quot; is a four-part docuseries released by Netflix on May 4, 2022. The documentary recounts the events, controversies, and lingering effects of the accident. Featured in the series are Rick Parks, a TMI nuclear engineer turned whistleblower against Bechtel; Lake Barrett, an independent energy consultant who served as the NRC&#x27;s on-site director for the TMI-2 cleanup; Eric Epstein, chairman of TMI Alert, a nuclear watchdog organization in central Pennsylvania; Michio Kaku, an American theoretical physicist; and residents of the communities affected by the event.

&quot;&quot; is a 2023 documentary about the accident.

<text>Anarchism and violence have been linked together by events in anarchist history such as violent revolution, terrorism, and assassination attempts. Leading late 19th century anarchists espoused propaganda by deed, or &quot;attentáts&quot;, and was associated with a number of incidents of political violence. Anarchist thought, however, is quite diverse on the question of violence. Where some anarchists have opposed coercive means on the basis of coherence, others have supported acts of violent revolution as a path toward anarchy. Anarcho-pacifism is a school of thought within anarchism which rejects all violence.

Many anarchists regard the state to be at the definitional center of structural violence: directly or indirectly preventing people from meeting their basic needs, calling for violence as self-defense.

Perhaps the first anarchist periodical was named &quot;The Peaceful Revolutionist&quot;.

== Propaganda by deed ==

Propaganda by deed (or propaganda of the deed, from the French ) is specific political direct action meant to be exemplary to others and serve as a catalyst for revolution. It is primarily associated with acts of violence perpetrated by proponents of insurrectionary anarchism in the late 19th and early 20th century, including bombings and assassinations aimed at the State, the ruling class, and Church arsons targeting religious groups, even though propaganda of the deed also had non-violent applications. These acts of terrorism were intended to ignite a &quot;spirit of revolt&quot; by demonstrating the state, the middle and upper classes, and religious organizations were not omnipotent and also to provoke the State to become escalatingly repressive in its response. The 1881 London Social Revolutionary Congress gave the tactic its approval.

The Italian revolutionary Carlo Pisacane wrote in his &quot;Political Testament&quot; (1857) that &quot;ideas spring from deeds and not the other way around&quot; and Mikhail Bakunin stated in 1870 that &quot;we must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda.&quot; By the 1880s, the slogan &quot;propaganda by deed&quot; had begun to be used both within and outside of the anarchist movement to refer to individual bombings, regicides and tyrannicides, and was formally adopted as a strategy by the anarchist 1881 London Social Revolutionary Congress.

While revolutionary bombings and assassinations appeared as an indiscriminate call to violence to outsiders, anarchists saw &quot;the idea of the propaganda by deed, or the &quot;attentat&quot; (attack), [as having] a very specific logic&quot;. In a capitalist world founded on force and constant threat of violence (laws, church, paychecks), &quot;to do nothing, to stand idly by while millions suffered, was itself to commit an act of violence&quot;. This did not seek to justify violence but find what violence would effectively undo malignant state forces. Propaganda by deed included stealing (in particular bank robberies – named &quot;expropriations&quot; or &quot;revolutionary expropriations&quot; to finance the organization), rioting and general strikes which aimed at creating the conditions of an insurrection or even a revolution. These acts were justified as the necessary counterpart to state repression. As early as 1911, Leon Trotsky condemned individual acts of violence by anarchists as useful for little more than providing an excuse for state repression. &quot;The anarchist prophets of the &#x27;propaganda by the deed&#x27; can argue all they want about the elevating and stimulating influence of terrorist acts on the masses,&quot; he wrote in 1911, &quot;Theoretical considerations and political experience prove otherwise.&quot; Vladimir Lenin largely agreed, viewing individual anarchist acts of terrorism as an ineffective substitute for coordinated action by disciplined cadres of the masses. Both Lenin and Trotsky acknowledged the necessity of violent rebellion and assassination to serve as a catalyst for revolution, but they distinguished between the &quot;ad hoc&quot; bombings and assassinations carried out by proponents of the propaganda by deed, and organized violence coordinated by a professional revolutionary vanguard utilized for that specific end. 

Some anarchists, such as Johann Most, advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries to &quot;preach ... action as propaganda&quot;. It was not advocacy for mass murder, but a call for targeted killings of the representatives of capitalism and government at a time when such action might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of government repression or labor conflicts, although Most himself once claimed that &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot; In 1885, he published &quot;The Science of Revolutionary Warfare&quot;, a technical manual for acquiring and detonating explosives based on the knowledge he acquired by working at an explosives factory in New Jersey. Most was an early influence on American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Berkman attempted propaganda by deed when he tried in 1892 to kill industrialist Henry Clay Frick following the deaths by shooting of several striking workers.

As early as 1887, a few important figures in the anarchist movement had begun to distance themselves from individual acts of violence. Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in &quot;Le Révolté&quot; that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;. A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement. The anarcho-syndicalist, Fernand Pelloutier, argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without &quot;the individual dynamiter.&quot; State repression (including the infamous 1894 French &quot;lois scélérates&quot;) of the anarchist and labor movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many &quot;communards&quot; to penal colonies, favored individualist political expression and acts.

The anarchist Luigi Galleani, perhaps the most vocal proponent of propaganda by deed from the turn of the century through the end of the First World War, took undisguised pride in describing himself as a subversive, a revolutionary propagandist and advocate of the violent overthrow of established government and institutions through the use of &#x27;direct action&#x27;, i.e., bombings and assassinations. Galleani heartily embraced physical violence and terrorism, not only against symbols of the government and the capitalist system, such as courthouses and factories, but also through direct assassination of &#x27;enemies of the people&#x27;: capitalists, industrialists, politicians, judges, and policemen. He had a particular interest in the use of bombs, going so far as to include a formula for the explosive nitroglycerine in one of his pamphlets advertised through his monthly magazine, &quot;Cronaca Sovversiva&quot;. By all accounts, Galleani was an extremely effective speaker and advocate of his policy of violent action, attracting a number of devoted Italian-American anarchist followers who called themselves Galleanists. Carlo Buda, the brother of Galleanist bombmaker Mario Buda, said of him, &quot;You heard Galleani speak, and you were ready to shoot the first policeman you saw&quot;.

== Anarcho-pacifism ==
Anarcho-pacifism (also pacifist anarchism or anarchist pacifism) is a form of anarchism which completely rejects the use of violence in any form for any purpose. Important proponents include Leo Tolstoy and Bart de Ligt. Mohandas Gandhi is an important influence.

Henry David Thoreau, though not a pacifist himself, influenced both Leo Tolstoy and Mohandas Gandhi&#x27;s advocacy of Nonviolent resistance through his work &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;.

At some point anarcho-pacifism had as its main proponent Christian anarchism. The first large-scale anarcho-pacifist movement was the Tolstoyan peasant movement in Russia. They were a predominantly peasant movement that set up hundreds of voluntary anarchist pacifist communes based on their interpretation of Christianity as requiring absolute pacifism and the rejection of all coercive authority.

&quot;Dutch anarchist-pacifist Bart de Ligt&#x27;s 1936 treatise &quot;The Conquest of Violence&quot; (with its none too subtle allusion to Kropotkin&#x27;s &quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot;) was also of signal importance.&quot; &quot;Gandhi&#x27;s ideas were popularized in the West in books such as Richard Gregg&#x27;s &quot;The Power of Nonviolence&quot; (1935), and Bart de Ligt&#x27;s &quot;The Conquest of Violence&quot; (1937).
Peter Gelderloos criticizes the idea that nonviolence is the only way to fight for a better world. According to Gelderloos, pacifism as an ideology serves the interests of the state.

== Anarchist theory ==

Anarchism encompasses a variety of views about violence. The Tolstoyan tradition of non-violent resistance is prevalent among some anarchists. Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;, a fictional novel about a society that practices &quot;Odonianism&quot;, expressed this anarchism:

Emma Goldman included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn&#x27;t oppose tactics like assassination in her early career, but changed her views after she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the Red Army. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocated violence only as a means of self-defense.

===Discourse on violent and non-violent means===
Some anarchists see violent revolution as necessary in the abolition of capitalist society, while others advocate non-violent methods. 
Errico Malatesta, an anarcho-communist, propounded that it is &quot;necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence which denies [the means of life and for development] to the workers.&quot; As he put it in &quot;Umanità Nova&quot; (no. 125, September 6, 1921):

Anarchists with this view advocate violence insofar as they see it to be necessary in ridding the world of exploitation, and especially states.

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon argued in favor of a non-violent revolution through a process of dual power in which libertarian socialist institutions would be established and form associations enabling the formation of an expanding network within the existing state-capitalist framework with the intention of eventually rendering both the state and the capitalist economy obsolete. The progression towards violence in anarchism stemmed, in part, from the massacres of some of the communes inspired by the ideas of Proudhon and others. Many anarcho-communists began to see a need for revolutionary violence to counteract the violence inherent in both capitalism and government.

Anarcho-pacifism is a tendency within the anarchist movement which rejects the use of violence in the struggle for social change. The main early influences were the thought of Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy. It developed &quot;mostly in Holland, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War&quot;. Opposition to the use of violence has not prohibited anarcho-pacifists from accepting the principle of resistance or even revolutionary action provided it does not result in violence; it was in fact their approval of such forms of opposition to power that lead many anarcho-pacifists to endorse the anarcho-syndicalist concept of the general strike as the great revolutionary weapon. Later anarcho-pacifists have also come to endorse the non-violent strategy of dual power.

Other anarchists have believed that violence is justified, especially in self-defense, as a way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Peter Gelderloos criticizes the idea that nonviolence is the only way to fight for a better world. According to Gelderloos, pacifism as an ideology serves the interests of the state and is hopelessly caught up psychologically with the control schema of patriarchy and white supremacy. The influential publishing collective CrimethInc. notes that &quot;violence&quot; and &quot;nonviolence&quot; are politicized terms that are used inconsistently in discourse, depending on whether or not a writer seeks to legitimize the actor in question. They argue that &quot;[i]t&#x27;s not strategic [for anarchists] to focus on delegitimizing each other&#x27;s efforts rather than coordinating to act together where we overlap&quot;. For this reason, both CrimethInc. and Gelderloos advocate for diversity of tactics. Albert Meltzer criticised extreme pacifism as authoritarian, believing that &quot;The cult of extreme nonviolence always implies an elite.&quot; However, he did believe that less extreme pacifism was compatible with anarchism.

== Notable actions ==
* July 23, 1892 – Alexander Berkman tries to kill American industrialist Henry Clay Frick in retaliation for the hiring of Pinkerton detectives to break up the Homestead Strike, resulting in the deaths of seven striking members of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers. Although badly wounded, Frick survives, and Berkman is arrested and eventually sentenced to 22 years in prison.

* November 7, 1893 – The Spanish anarchist Santiago Salvador throws two Orsini bombs into the orchestra pit of the Liceu Theater in Barcelona during the second act of the opera &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, killing some twenty people and injuring scores of others.
* December 9, 1893 – Auguste Vaillant throws a nail bomb in the French National Assembly, killing nobody and injuring one. He is then sentenced to death and executed by the guillotine on February 4, 1894, shouting &quot;Death to bourgeois society and long live anarchy!&quot; (&quot;À mort la société bourgeoise et vive l&#x27;anarchie!&quot;).

* February 12, 1894 – Émile Henry, intending to avenge Auguste Vaillant, sets off a bomb in &quot;Café Terminus&quot; (a café near the Gare Saint-Lazare train station in Paris), killing one and injuring twenty. During his trial, when asked why he wanted to harm so many innocent people, he declares, &quot;There is no innocent bourgeois.&quot; This act is one of the rare exceptions to the rule that propaganda by deed targets only specific powerful individuals. Henry was convicted and executed by guillotine on May 21.

<text>The Newport Ship is a mid-fifteenth-century sailing vessel discovered when archaeologists investigated an articulated timber structure uncovered during the building of the Riverfront Arts Centre in Newport in June 2002. The site is on the west bank of the River Usk, which runs through the city centre. The remains of the ship suffered some damage from the construction work, but still represents a substantial find of a late Medieval ship, together with significant artefacts and environmental material. The official name of the vessel is now the Newport Medieval Ship, to help distinguish it from other historical vessels.

The ship was originally around long and has been estimated to be of 161 tons burden – that being the number of tuns of Bordeaux wine that could have stowed in its hold. Vessels of this size were considered &#x27;great ships&#x27; by contemporary standards and were typically used for the long-distance trade between Britain, Biscay and southern Iberia. 

The most likely construction date of the ship is immediately after the winter of 1457/8. This date was obtained by oxygen isotope dendrochronology. An earlier standard dendrochronology study (measuring the width of annual growth rings) has given a likely felling date of 1449 for the majority of the timbers. This earlier study identified Basque region of Northern Spain as the source of the shipbuilding timber. This is an area well known for its shipbuilding industry at this time. Timbers associated with later phases of repair come from Britain, as do a large number of structural pieces dating from c.1466. These timbers have been associated with the major renovation work being carried out in Newport at the time the vessel foundered. Remnants of a cradle found beneath the ship suggested that it had been berthed for repair but then abandoned after the supports on the starboard side gave way. Many of the artefacts in the ship, such as coins, pottery and plant remains, suggest that it was trading with Portugal in the 1450s–1460s.

Although there were no initial plans to preserve the ship in its entirety, local people campaigned eagerly to ensure this, leading to the foundation of the Friends of the Newport Ship. Initial estimates suggested that preservation would cost about £3.5 million and this sum was eventually found by the Welsh Assembly Government and Newport City Council. All of the ship&#x27;s timbers have subsequently been raised and transferred to a dedicated industrial unit which the local council describes as &quot;now the biggest wood conservation centre in the UK&quot;, where preservation and research continue. Due to its size, it has not been possible to display the ship in the basement of the new arts centre, as was originally proposed.

== Loss of the ship ==
The River Usk has a large tidal range and it appears that the vessel was deballasted and carefully floated into a side channel or Pîl on a very high tide and then situated on a pre-erected cradle made of oak and elm logs. This cradle has an earliest date possible of the spring of 1468 (by dendrochronology). The ship appears to have been undergoing a major refit, as evidenced by the shaping and inserting of British-grown timber (dating to after 1465) into the vessel. However, before this repair work could be completed, the cradle appears to have collapsed, with the ship heeling over onto its starboard side. The subsequent incoming tides appear to have flooded the vessel with silt and water. However, efforts were made to drain, pump out and right the ship, and when these failed attention turned to salvaging the accessible timber and iron (for reuse), along with removing larger items such as anchors, guns and rigging. The salvaging of the vessel involved hacking at the upper works with axes and removing substantial amounts of the lapstrake planking, framing and internal timbers. The salvaged material would have been readily reusable in other ships or building works. During this salvage work, numerous disarticulated timbers accrued in the hold of the vessel.

== Condition, dimensions and structure ==
The excellent condition of the ship&#x27;s timbers may possibly be due to the low oxygen level in the mud of the River Usk which has inhibited the presence of wood-boring creatures. Some time during its berth the port (left) side of the ship was cut down about above the keel, but fortuitously this has preserved the correct shape of the hull. The starboard (right) side, which collapsed onto the river mud long ago, together with the ship&#x27;s frames, has been preserved to almost its full height, although some planking has been distorted by the collapse.

The ship&#x27;s dimensions have now been estimated at around in length and around in width. It had an estimated carrying capacity of 161 &#x27;tons burden&#x27;. That was a contemporary measure of ship size, based on the number of tuns (a size of barrel) of wine a ship could carry. In the 1460s customs accounts of nearby Bristol, vessels of 150+ tons were typically called &#x27;navis&#x27; (great ship) and used primarily for the long-distance voyages to southern Europe, particularly Lisbon.

The vessel was clinker built with each plank overlapping the one below, the lower plank always being on the inside of the one above. The planks of the outer hull were positioned first and, on the Newport Ship, are secured to each other with iron nails driven through the overlap from the outside and then fitted with iron rove plates. The end of each nail was then hammered flat against the rove to produce a tight seal. Gaps along the overlap were secured by caulking with tar and animal hair. Hair from horse, cow, sheep and goat has all been identified in the Newport ship. The frames (ribs) of the ship were then fitted inside the hull and secured to the planks. Each framing piece was secured to the keel (spine) of the ship by having its keel cutout placed over the keel and held by precision of fit. Nails and trenails have not been used in this ship to secure frames to keel. The keel is made of beech, but the rest of the ship is made of oak, although no reason for this has yet been suggested. One possible explanation is a simple shortage of oak compared with beech at the time of construction. The hull planking is radially split oak which has been finished with an axe or adze. The keel and frames are also finished with an axe or adze. This contrasts with the stringers, hatch covers, ceiling and deck planks, which were all sawn.

Inside the frames are stringers: longitudinal structural components. Seven runs of stringers were found on the more-preserved starboard side. Between the stringers, the inside of the hull was lined with ceiling planksthese are thinner than the stringers and, together with the stringers, serve to stop cargo or ballast from coming into contact with the inside of the external planking of the hull. Both the stringers and ceiling planks were made of sawn oak, in contrast to the radially split hull planks and the hewn framing. The highest surviving stringer shows evidence of supporting the first deck.

Cleaning of the timbers has led to the discovery, on the planking of the outer hull, of a series of marks deliberately scribed into the timbers. These appear to be either individual shipwrights&#x27; marks or instructions for the positioning of planks or fastenings. The conservation team is hoping that a pattern will emerge as the recording process continues. During mid 2007, the cleaning of barrel-top fragments revealed merchant marks. Some of these may resemble known marks of merchants from the city of Bristol, but this is not proof that they originated there.

==Dating the ship==
The first phase of dendrochronology showed that most of the timbers used to build the ship originate from the Basque Country of northern Spain dating from c.1449. A later oxygen isotope dendrochronology study of components used in the original construction give a felling date of the winter of 1457/8. Since it was the practice to use green timber in ship construction at this time, the build date is most likely very shortly after this felling date. This date of winter 1457/1458 is confirmed by oxygen isotope dendrochronology analysis of the beech keel (a timber species which, unlike oak, does not have a substantial ring-width dendrochronology database). The precise geographic origin of the original build timber will require further work to develop the dendrochronological database for north-western Spain. At present the best matches are with timber grown in the upland interior of the Basque region of Spain. As the database is expanded, better matches may be found within the same general area.

The discovery in the spring of 2006 of a French &quot;petit blanc&quot; (small white) silver coin inserted into a cut out in the stempost/keel join was a major step forward. Placed, perhaps, as a token of good fortune at the start of the ship&#x27;s construction, this coin was minted in Crémieu in the Dauphinois region of France between May and July 1447. Tree trunks found under the hull and forming the support for the ship when under repair, have a latest dendrochronology date of the spring of 1468. This would give the ship a working life span of less than 10 years.

There is circumstantial evidence that by 1469 the ship may have belonged to and been under repair for the Earl of Warwick. A letter of authorisation dated 22 November 1469 from Warwick to Thomas Throkmorton, his receiver of Glamorgan and Morgannwg, authorised various payments for &quot;the making of the ship at Newport&quot; which could be construed as repairs to the badly damaged vessel. This association of the ship with known historical figures is questioned as being a common failing of historians when studying archaeological remains. The simplest (though not only) explanation is that this was a ship from the Iberian peninsula that required some repairs whilst in the Bristol area. Research has shown that Newport sometimes had some very large vessels in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, like the Newport Medieval Ship. These were used primarily to serve the long-distance trade of Bristol, which was then the second port of the realm.

==Artefacts==

During excavation several hundred objects were found within the ship, ranging from a stone cannonball to grape seeds and including a damaged hour glass, 13 single shoes of which one is a very expensive shoe, pieces of cork and some Portuguese coins. The seeds, cork and coins would suggest trade to and from the Iberian Peninsula and the presence of Merino sheep wool in the caulking material supports this idea; but is not conclusive proof. Members of the Albaola Society based Pasaia, near San Sebastian in the Basque region of Spain, after studying the ship&#x27;s structural details believe that the ship may have been built by Basque shipwrights, either in the Basque region of Spain or south-western France. Artefacts, including Portuguese coins and ceramic shards, along with waterlogged plant remains indicate strong trading links with Portugal, with a strong possibility that the vessel was Portuguese-crewed. The ceramic shards are nearly all Iberian micaceous red-ware and likely Portuguese in origin. The ceramic assemblage is highly variable in form and also some pieces are soot stained, leading to the conclusion that this material represents crew items as opposed to cargo.

The environmental samples also contained a variety of well-preserved plant, insect and faunal remains. Foodstuffs including walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, pomegranates, grapes, figs and olives were found, along with over a thousand fish and animal bones. Cod, hake, ling, tusk, herring, blackspot bream, conger, flatfish and Atlantic salmon are just some of the species represented in the fishbone assemblage. Shellfish recovered included oysters, whelks, mussels and cockles. Human fleas, dog fleas and numerous flies were present in the bilges of the ship, as well as some interesting beetles, including the woodboring beetle, which has never been found in the UK before. The animal bone collection primarily consisted of domesticated cattle, goats, sheep and pigs. Archaeologists also found rat bones and quantities of domestic fowl bones. In addition to salted or smoked meats and fish, it is likely that livestock was kept on board, as evidenced by certain grass and plant remains that are suited for animal food and bedding.

==Project progress==

The first stage of the restoration project; the cleaning and recording of the timbers, was completed in April 2008. The timbers were immersed in ordinary mains water, in a series of large shallow tanks. Once the cleaning had been completed the timbers were individually recorded using a FaroArm, a portable coordinate measuring machine (CMM), and RHINO software. This technology was used to produce 3-dimensional rotatable images of each artefact found in the vessel to submillimeter precision, allowing for the close study of each timber and an accurate recording of any blemishes or damage to the timbers. The Newport ship was one of the first marine archeological projects to pioneer the use of Faro equipment and RHINO software.

The next stage, the conservation of the timbers, which began later in 2008, involved immersing the timbers in polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution for an extended period. Before this began, some of the timbers required treatment with triammonium citrate to remove residual iron residues in the nail holes of the outer hull planking. This unexpected additional phase added no more than between fifteen and eighteen months to the project.

In September 2016 all of the ship&#x27;s timbers completed their PEG treatment cycle and are now being freeze dried to draw out all of the residual water in preparation for the eventual reconstruction of the vessel. As of August 2019, 60% of the timbers have been freeze dried with all the timbers set to be returned by 2021.

A conference entitled &quot;The World of the Newport Ship&quot; was held at the University of Bristol on 17–18 July 2014, examining the vessel, her significance and her historical context. This led to the production of an edited volume based on the work of the contributors, published by the University of Wales Press.

Most current funding for the preservation of the ship comes from the Heritage Lottery Fund with smaller contributions from the National Assembly for Wales, Newport City Council and the Friends of Newport Ship.

==Viewing==
The Friends of Newport Ship organises regular open days when the project may be viewed in its current state of restoration along with exhibits to explain the restoration process. Visitors have the opportunity to talk to members of the ship team, and find out about the excavation and the campaign to save the ship, through tours of the facility run by the support group Friends of the Newport Ship. Generally the Ship Centre is open every Friday and Saturday from 10.30-4.0pm, between Easter and the end of October, and then on Saturdays only from spring half term until Easter and for November and early December.

<text>Morna Anne Murray (born June 20, 1945) is a Canadian retired singer of pop, country, and adult contemporary music, who has sold over 55 million album copies worldwide during her over 40-year career. Murray has won four Grammys including the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1979.

Murray was the first Canadian female solo singer to reach No. 1 on the U.S. charts and also the first to earn a Gold record for one of her signature songs, &quot;Snowbird&quot; (1970). She is often cited as one of the female Canadian artists who paved the way for other international Canadian success stories such as k.d. lang, Céline Dion, and Shania Twain. Murray is well known for her Grammy Award-winning 1978 number-one hit (in several countries) &quot;You Needed Me&quot;, and is the first woman and the first Canadian to win Album of the Year at the 1984 Country Music Association Awards for her Gold-plus 1983 album &quot;A Little Good News&quot;.

Besides four Grammys, Murray has received a record 24 Juno Awards, three American Music Awards, three Country Music Association Awards, and three Canadian Country Music Association Awards. She has been inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame, the Juno Hall of Fame, the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame. She is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame Walkway of Stars in Nashville and has her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles and on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto.

In 2011, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her 10th on their list of the 50 Biggest Adult Contemporary Artists Ever.

==Early life==
Morna Anne Murray was born in the coal-mining town of Springhill, Nova Scotia, to Dr. James Carson Murray, the town&#x27;s physician, and Marion Margaret (née Burke) Murray, a nurse involved in community charity work. Anne has five brothers. Murray&#x27;s father died of leukemia aged 72 in 1980; her mother died on April 10, 2006, aged 92 after a series of strokes during heart surgery. Murray&#x27;s youngest brother Bruce died of pancreatic cancer aged 69 on September 15, 2020.

After expressing an early interest in music, she studied piano for six years. By age 15, Murray took a bus ride every Saturday morning from Springhill to Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia, for singing lessons. One of her earliest performances was of the song &quot;Ave Maria&quot; at her high school graduation in 1962. Following high school, Murray attended Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax for one year. She later studied Physical Education at University of New Brunswick in Fredericton. After receiving her degree in 1966, Murray taught physical education at Athena Regional high school in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, for one year.

Her brother Bruce Murray released several recordings of his own with several songs on the RPM charts between 1976 and 1982.

==Career==
===Early years===
In 1965, Murray appeared on the University of New Brunswick student project record &quot;The Groove&quot; (500 pressed). She sang two songs on the record – &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; and &quot;Little Bit of Soap&quot;. On the label, her name was misspelled &quot;Anne Murry&quot;. While there, she was encouraged to audition for the 1960s CBC musical variety television show &quot;Singalong Jubilee&quot;, but was not offered a singing position.

After a summer of singing in local venues across the Maritimes, Murray began teaching physical education at the high school in Summerside, Prince Edward Island. After one year of teaching, she was cast for &quot;Singalong Jubilee&quot;. As a regular member of the &quot;Singalong Jubilee&quot; cast, Murray appeared on the &quot;Singalong Jubilee Vol. III&quot; soundtrack and &quot;Our Family Album – The Singalong Jubilee Cast&quot; records released by Arc Records. The show&#x27;s musical director, Brian Ahern, advised Murray that she should move to Toronto and record a solo album. Her first album, &quot;What About Me&quot;, was produced by Ahern in Toronto and released in 1968 on the Arc label.

===Chart success, 1970s–1980s===

&quot;What About Me,&quot; the lead single and title cut on Murray&#x27;s debut album, was written by Scott McKenzie and was a sizable Canadian radio hit. The project covered songs by Joni Mitchell, Ken Tobias, and John Denver. After a year-long stint on Arc, Murray switched to Capitol Records in 1969 to record her second album, &quot;This Way Is My Way&quot;, which was released that fall. It featured the single that launched her career, &quot;Snowbird&quot;, which became a No. 1 hit in Canada. &quot;Snowbird&quot; became a surprise hit on the U.S. charts as well, reaching No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1970. It was also the first of her eight No. 1 Adult Contemporary hits. &quot;Snowbird&quot; was the first Gold record ever given to a Canadian artist in the United States (RIAA certified Gold on November 16, 1970). As one of the most successful female artists at that time, she became in demand for several television appearances in Canada and the United States, eventually becoming a regular on the hit U.S. television series &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot;.

After the success of &quot;Snowbird&quot;, Murray had a number of subsequent singles that charted both pop and country simultaneously. During the 1970s and 1980s, her hits included Kenny Loggins&#x27;s &quot;Danny&#x27;s Song&quot; (1972) (peaked at No. 7 on the Hot 100), &quot;A Love Song&quot; (1973), &quot;He Thinks I Still Care&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; (1974); her all-time biggest Hot 100 hit &quot;You Needed Me&quot; (1978), &quot;I Just Fall in Love Again&quot;, &quot;Shadows in the Moonlight&quot;, &quot;Broken Hearted Me&quot; (1979), &quot;I&#x27;m Happy Just to Dance With You&quot; (1980), which hit No. 64 on the Hot 100 and #23 on the Country chart, The Monkees&#x27; 1967 No. 1 hit &quot;Daydream Believer&quot;, &quot;Could I Have This Dance&quot; from the &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; motion picture soundtrack (1980), &quot;Blessed Are the Believers&quot; (1981), &quot;Another Sleepless Night&quot; (1982), &quot;A Little Good News&quot; (1983), &quot;Just Another Woman in Love&quot;, &quot;Nobody Loves Me Like You Do&quot;, and &quot;Time, Don&#x27;t Run Out on Me&quot; (1985).

She performed &quot;O Canada&quot; at the first American League baseball game played in Canada on April 7, 1977, when the Toronto Blue Jays played the Chicago White Sox at Exhibition Stadium. She reprised the Canadian national anthem prior to the first World Series game held in Canada, Game 3 of the 1992 World Series at the SkyDome. Following the last game at Maple Leaf Gardens, she concluded the arena&#x27;s closing ceremony by singing &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot; at centre ice wearing a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey.

Murray was a celebrity corporate spokeswoman for The Bay, and she also did commercials and sang the company jingle (&quot;You Can Count on the Commerce&quot;) for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC).

Murray&#x27;s last Hot 100 hit was &quot;Now and Forever (You and Me)&quot; from 1986; it was also her last No. 1 on both the American and Canadian country charts.

===1990s–2000s===
Murray&#x27;s last charting single in the U.S. was 1991&#x27;s &quot;Everyday&quot;, which appeared on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Country Singles chart. In 1996, Murray signed on with a new manager, Bruce Allen. She recorded her first live album in 1997, and in 1999, she released &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, a platinum inspirational album, which went to No. 1 Contemporary Christian, No. 4 Country and No. 38 pop. Murray&#x27;s last charting single in Canada was the title track &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; in 2000.

Murray was briefly mentioned in the Oscar-nominated satirical song &quot;Blame Canada,&quot; which appeared in the 1999 film &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;. Although the tune contained the line &quot;With all their hockey hullabaloo/And that bitch Anne Murray, too&quot;, the singer indicated that she was not offended by the song (although she did turn down a chance to sing it at the Oscars telecast that year, pleading a prior commitment).

She released &quot;Country Croonin&#x27;&quot; in 2002, the follow-up to her successful 1993 album, &quot;Croonin&#x27;&quot;. In 2004, she released &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot; in Canada only, which features a collection of songs from the early 20th century to the mid-1940s. The 2005 American version, titled &quot;All of Me&quot;, features a bonus disc containing many of her hit singles. The album is dedicated to her friend Cynthia McReynolds who died of cancer.

On December 26, 2004, Murray joined other Canadian music stars in the Canada for Asia Telethon, a three-hour, tsunami relief concert broadcast on CBC Television (January 13, 2005) to support CARE Canada&#x27;s efforts. Bryan Adams and Murray closed the show with a duet, &quot;What Would It Take&quot;.

On October 10, 2007, Murray announced that she would embark on her final major tour. She toured in February and March 2008 in the U.S. on the &quot;Coast-to-Coast – One Last Time&quot; tour followed by a run in April and May in Canada. Murray&#x27;s final public concert was held at the Sony Centre in Toronto on May 23, 2008.

The studio album &quot;Anne Murray Duets: Friends &amp; Legends&quot; was released in November 2007 in Canada and January 2008 in the U.S. The album comprised 17 tracks that included many of Murray&#x27;s biggest hits over her four-decade career, re-recorded as duets with other established, rising, and – in one case – deceased female singers. These artists included Céline Dion, Shania Twain, k.d. lang, Nelly Furtado, Jann Arden, Québec&#x27;s Isabelle Boulay, Murray&#x27;s daughter Dawn Langstroth, Olivia Newton-John, Emmylou Harris, Martina McBride, Shelby Lynne, Amy Grant, Carole King, the Indigo Girls, Irish sextet Celtic Woman, Dusty Springfield, and Sarah Brightman. The duet with soprano Brightman was of her 1970 hit song, &quot;Snowbird&quot;.

&quot;Anne Murray Duets: Friends and Legends&quot; was recorded in four cities – Toronto, Nashville, New York, and Los Angeles. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the album reached No. 2 on the Canadian pop album charts and was certified Double Platinum in Canada after merely two months, representing sales of over 200,000 units. The album was the second-highest debuting CD on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 albums chart for the week ending February 2, 2008. It entered the chart at No. 42, making it her highest-charting U.S. CD release since 1999&#x27;s &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, which peaked at No. 38 on the Top 200 and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Also for the week ending February 2, 2008, the CD debuted at No. 8 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Country Albums chart and at No. 3 on its Top Internet Albums chart. Murray was nominated for the 2008 Juno Award for Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year.

Murray&#x27;s album &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; was re-released in July 2008 in North America as a 14-song package. A new Christmas album, titled &quot;Anne Murray&#x27;s Christmas Album&quot; with bonus DVD was released in October 2008. Sony BMG Music also released an Elvis Presley Christmas album, titled &quot;Christmas Duets&quot; on October 14, 2008, featuring a virtual duet of &quot;Silver Bells&quot; with Murray.

Murray retired from both recording and performing after the issue of her final Christmas album in 2008, later explaining, &quot;I did it for 40 years and that&#x27;s long enough to do anything...I wanted to go out still singing well, and not having to make excuses.&quot; Despite continuing offers to take part in live concert appearances, duets and other recording activities, Murray has remained firmly retired since then, and insists she hasn&#x27;t second-guessed the decision for a moment: &quot;I was one of those who couldn&#x27;t. I have too much trouble settling for less.&quot;

===Television===
Murray has had five highly rated U.S. specials on CBS (over 40 million viewers each) and several Canadian specials on CBC including &quot;Anne Murray in Nova Scotia&quot;, &quot;Intimate Evening with Anne Murray&quot;, &quot;Anne Murray RSVP&quot;, &quot;A Special Anne Murray Christmas&quot;, &quot;Legends &amp; Friends&quot;, &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot;, &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, &quot;Ladies Night Show&quot;, &quot;Anne Murray in Walt Disney World&quot; and &quot;Anne Murray&#x27;s Classic Christmas&quot;. Her 2008 television special, &quot;Family Christmas&quot;, garnered a 43 per cent share on CBC with 4.2 million viewers.

She has appeared on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;, &quot;The Bobby Vinton Show&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;Dean Martin Summer Show&quot;, &quot;Singalong Jubilee&quot;, &quot;Dinah!&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;Dolly!&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;Christmas in Washington&quot;, &quot;Boston Pops&quot;, &quot;The Helen Reddy Show&quot;, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot;, CNN, &quot;Perry Como&#x27;s Christmas in New Mexico&quot;, &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot;, &quot;Night of a 100 Stars&quot;, &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;, &quot;The Pat Sajak Show&quot;, &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Her 2005 CBC special &quot;Anne Murray: The Music of My Life&quot; broke ratings records for a Thursday night, with more than 7 million Canadian viewers tuned in. She also appeared on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, and on regional US dance/variety programs. On August 25, 2008, Murray appeared on the TV program &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; as a mentor.

&quot;Anne Murray: Full Circle&quot;, a documentary film by Adrian Buitenhuis and Morgan Elliott, was broadcast by CBC Television in 2021.

==Personal life==
In 2009, Murray released her autobiography, &quot;All of Me&quot;, and embarked on a 15-city book signing tour, starting in Nashville on October 27, 2009, and ending in Ottawa on November 24, 2009. The tour also included a special &quot;In Conversation&quot; interview with Michael Posner at the International Festival of Authors in Toronto on October 30, 2009.

She is Catholic.

Her nephew Paul Murray was lead singer of the 1990s Canadian alternative rock group Sandbox.

===Marriage and children===
In 1975, Murray married Bill Langstroth, music producer and longtime host of &quot;Singalong Jubilee&quot;. They had two children – William (born 1976) and Dawn (born 1979). Dawn is a singer-songwriter and artist who has recorded with her mother a number of times, including the duet &quot;Let There Be Love&quot; in 1999 for Murray&#x27;s &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; album. Murray and Dawn were featured in a mother–daughter duet of &quot;Nobody Loves Me Like You Do&quot; on Murray&#x27;s hit 2008 U.S. CD (released in late 2007 in Canada), &quot;Anne Murray Duets: Friends &amp; Legends&quot;. Murray and Langstroth separated in 1997 and divorced the following year. Langstroth died in May 2013.

In January 1998, Murray and Dawn performed at a benefit concert for Sheena&#x27;s Place, an eating disorder treatment centre in Toronto. Both have spoken publicly about Dawn&#x27;s struggle with anorexia nervosa, which developed when she was 10 years old. Dawn has since sought treatment and continues to pursue a career in music.

Murray lived in Thornhill, Ontario, for over 40 years, from the late 1970s through 2019. In 2019, she returned to live in her home province of Nova Scotia, settling in Halifax.

===Philanthropy and support for causes===

Murray kept close ties with her hometown, Springhill, Nova Scotia, located about an hour east of Moncton, New Brunswick, and 2 hours north of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Anne Murray Centre, located in Springhill, opened on July 28, 1989, and houses a collection of memorabilia from both her personal life and professional career in a series of displays. A registered Canadian charity, the centre aims to foster tourism in the area and promote awareness of the music of Nova Scotia and Canada. All the revenue generated from its operation is used to provide employment for local people and for its ongoing maintenance.

Murray was involved in the construction of the Dr. Carson and Marion Murray Community Centre in Springhill, Nova Scotia. She served as the honorary chair of the fundraising campaign to replace the town arena that collapsed after a peewee hockey game in 2002. Named for her parents, the Dr. Carson and Marion Murray Community Centre sports an NHL-size ice sheet with seating for 800 people, a walking track, multi-purpose room, community room with seating for up to 300, and a gym. The Dr. Carson and Marion Murray Community Centre has become an integral part of the Springhill community since opening on September 15, 2004.

Murray was involved in a variety of charitable organizations. In addition to being the Honorary National Chairperson of the Canadian Save The Children Fund, she served as a spokeswoman for many charities throughout her career – most recently Colon Cancer Canada. On May 20, 2009, Colon Cancer Canada launched the inaugural Anne Murray Charity Golf Classic. Over C$150,000 was raised through the event.

On February 12, 2010, Murray was one of the eight Canadians who carried the Olympic flag during the opening ceremony of the XXI Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver.

Murray was a public supporter of Canadian environmentalist and geneticist David Suzuki&#x27;s Nature Challenge.

===Hobbies===
A longtime golf enthusiast, Murray made history in October 2003 at the Turning Stone Resort &amp; Casino in Verona, New York, by becoming the first woman to score a hole in one on the 108-yard, par 3, 17th hole at the Kaluhyat Golf Club. On May 11, 2007, &quot;Golf For Women&quot; magazine named Murray the world&#x27;s best female celebrity golfer, noting her 11 handicap.

<text>The Suffolk Coast Path is a long-distance footpath along the Suffolk Heritage Coast in England. It is long.

Previously known as the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Path after the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty through which it runs, the path has been rebranded with new waymarkers bearing the new name. 

The path runs along river and sea walls, across marsh, heath, foreshore and cliffs. It starts at Felixstowe and ends at Lowestoft , via Bawdsey, Snape Maltings, Aldeburgh, North Warren, Thorpeness, Minsmere, Dunwich, Southwold and Kessingland. It connects with the Sandlings Walk and (via the Stour and Orwell Walk) with the Essex Way and the Stour Valley Path.

Much of W. G. Sebald&#x27;s novel The Rings of Saturn describes a walking tour that roughly follows the Suffolk Coast Path.

<text>The Suffolk &amp; Essex Coast &amp; Heaths National Landscape is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Suffolk and Essex, England.

The AONB covers ancient woodland, commercial forestry, the estuaries of the Alde, Blyth, Deben, Orwell and Stour rivers, farmland, salt marsh, heathland, mudflats, reed beds, small towns and villages, shingle beaches and low eroding cliffs along 60 miles of coastline.

Features include the coastal towns of Aldeburgh and Southwold, Bawdsey, Covehithe, Dunwich, Minsmere, Orford, Orford Ness, Sizewell, Thorpeness, Walberswick and the RSPB Minsmere Reserve. There are three National Nature Reserves in the area and many Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Three long-distance footpaths pass through the AONB: the Suffolk Coast Path, the Sandlings Walk and the Stour and Orwell Walk.

In July 2020 the AONB was extended by around 38 square kilometres to cover land north of Brantham, and an area around Mistley and Wrabness in Essex. It was the first extension to any AONB in England since 2011.

<doc id="105868" wikidata="Q2218407" url="?curid=105868" title="International mobile subscriber identity">
<text>The international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI; ) is a number that uniquely identifies every user of a cellular network. It is stored as a field and is sent by the mobile device to the network. It is also used for acquiring other details of the mobile in the home location register (HLR) or as locally copied in the visitor location register. To prevent eavesdroppers from identifying and tracking the subscriber on the radio interface, the IMSI is sent as rarely as possible and a randomly-generated TMSI is sent instead.

The IMSI is used in &quot;any&quot; mobile network that interconnects with other networks. For GSM, UMTS and LTE networks, this number was provisioned in the SIM card and for cdmaOne and CDMA2000 networks, in the phone directly or in the R-UIM card (the CDMA equivalent of the SIM card). Both cards have been superseded by the UICC.

An IMSI is usually presented as a 15-digit number but can be shorter. For example, MTN South Africa&#x27;s old IMSIs that are still in use in the market are 14 digits long. The first 3 digits represent the mobile country code (MCC), which is followed by the mobile network code (MNC), either 2-digit (European standard) or 3-digit (North American standard). The length of the MNC depends on the value of the MCC, and it is recommended that the length is uniform within a MCC area. The remaining digits are the mobile subscription identification number (MSIN) within the network&#x27;s customer base, usually 9 to 10 digits long, depending on the length of the MNC.

The IMSI conforms to the ITU E.212 numbering standard.

IMSIs can sometimes be mistaken for the ICCID (E.118), which is the identifier for the physical SIM card itself (or now the virtual SIM card if it is an eSIM). The IMSI lives as part of the profile (or one of several profiles if the SIM and operator support multi-IMSI SIMs) on the SIM/ICCID.

== Examples of IMSI numeric presentational ==




== IMSI analysis ==
IMSI analysis is the process of examining a subscriber&#x27;s IMSI to identify the network the IMSI belongs to, and whether subscribers from that network may use a given network (if they are not local subscribers, this requires a roaming agreement). 

If the subscriber is not from the provider&#x27;s network, the IMSI must be converted to a Global Title, which can then be used for accessing the subscriber&#x27;s data in the remote HLR. This is mainly important for international mobile roaming. Outside North America, the IMSI is converted to the Mobile Global Title (MGT) format, standard E.214, which is similar to an E.164 number. E.214 provides a method to convert the IMSI into a number that can be used for routing to international SS7 switches. E.214 can be interpreted as implying that there are two separate stages of conversion; first determine the MCC and convert to E.164 country calling code then determine MNC and convert to national network code for the carrier&#x27;s network. But this process is not used in practice and the GSM numbering authority has clearly stated that a one-stage process is used .

In North America, the IMSI is directly converted to an E.212 number with no modification of its value. This can be routed directly on American SS7 networks.

After this conversion, SCCP is used to send the message to its final destination. For details, see Global Title Translation.

=== Example of outside World Area 1 ===
This example shows the actual practice which is not clearly described in the standards.

Translation rule: 
* match numbers starting 28401 &quot;(Bulgaria mobile country code + MobilTel MNC)&quot;

<doc id="105872" wikidata="Q931165" url="?curid=105872" title="Clueless">
<text>Clueless is a 1995 American coming-of-age teen comedy film written and directed by Amy Heckerling. It stars Alicia Silverstone with supporting roles by Stacey Dash, Brittany Murphy, and Paul Rudd (in his film debut). It was produced by Scott Rudin and Robert Lawrence.

The film is a loose adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s 1815 novel &quot;Emma&quot;. The plot centers on a beautiful, popular, wealthy high school student who wants to do &quot;good deeds.&quot; She befriends a newcomer and decides to give her a makeover while playing matchmaker for her teachers and examining her own existence.

&quot;Clueless&quot; was filmed in Southern California over a 40-day schedule. Heckerling studied Beverly Hills High School students to understand how teenagers in the 1990s talked and learned some appropriate slang terms from them.

The film grossed $88 million worldwide, and was further successful in the home video market. It has received positive reviews from critics and is considered to be one of the best teen films of all time. &quot;Clueless&quot; has developed a cult following and has a continuing legacy. The film was followed by a spin-off television sitcom and series of books.

==Plot==
Cher Horowitz is a stylish, popular, and good-natured teenager living in a Beverly Hills mansion with her wealthy father, Mel, a gruff litigator; her mother died during a liposuction procedure when Cher was a baby. She attends Bronson Alcott High School with her best friend Dionne Davenport, who is also beautiful and from a wealthy family. Dionne has a long-term relationship with popular student Murray Duvall, though Cher believes she should be dating more mature men.

Josh Lucas, the socially conscious son of Mel&#x27;s ex-wife of only a few weeks, visits Cher and her father during a break from college. She playfully mocks his idealism while he teases her for her vanity, superficiality, and selfishness.

After receiving a poor grade, Cher decides to orchestrate a romance between two teachers at her school, Miss Geist and the hard-grading Mr. Hall. As a result, Hall relaxes his standards, allowing Cher to renegotiate the grade. After seeing their newfound happiness, she realizes she enjoys doing good deeds.

When a &quot;clueless&quot; transfer student named Tai Frasier arrives at the school, Cher decides to make her her next project. She gives her a makeover with the help of Dionne, providing Tai with confidence and a sense of style. Cher tries to extinguish the attraction between her and Travis Birkenstock, an amiable but clumsy skateboarding slacker, and instead steers Tai towards handsome, popular student Elton Tiscia.

However, Elton has no interest in Tai and is instead interested in Cher. She only realizes this when he tries to kiss her in his car after a party in Sun Valley. When she rebuffs him, he leaves her in a parking lot out of spite, and she is mugged at gunpoint. With no money, her only choice is to call Josh to pick her up. He realizes that despite her superficiality, she is sincere. She begins to enjoy staying home with him, and they begin to bond.

Fashion-conscious new student Christian Stovitz attracts Cher&#x27;s attention and becomes her target for a boyfriend. When she goes to a party with him, Josh becomes protective and decides to follow her to the party. She invites Christian to her home and tries to seduce him, but he deflects her advances, only later realizing that Christian is gay. Despite the failure of her romantic overtures, Cher remains friends with Christian due to her admiration of his taste in art and fashion.

Cher&#x27;s privileged life takes a negative turn when Tai&#x27;s newfound popularity strains their relationship and when she fails her driving test and, for the first time, cannot change the result. Returning home in a depressed mood, Tai confesses to Cher that she has feelings for Josh and asks her for help in pursuing him. Cher tells Tai that she is not right for Josh, leading to the two girls falling out.

Feeling &quot;totally clueless,&quot; Cher reflects on her priorities and repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life. After thinking about why she is bothered by Tai&#x27;s romantic interest in Josh, Cher finally realizes that she is in love with him.

In response to her epiphany, Cher begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, including captaining the school&#x27;s Pismo Beach disaster relief effort. She accepts an invitation from Travis to a skating tournament in Long Beach, where she reconciles with Tai.

Cher and Josh eventually realize their feelings for one another, culminating in a kiss. Ultimately, her friendships with Tai and Dionne are solidified. Sometime later, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist get married, and Cher attends the wedding with Josh, Dionne, Murray, and Tai and Travis (who have begun dating). Cher catches the wedding bouquet, and she and Josh embrace and kiss.

==Production==
===Development===
The idea for &quot;Clueless&quot; first originated as a television pilot in 1993. Writer and director Amy Heckerling said: &quot;Twentieth Century Fox said they wanted a show about teenagers—but not the nerds. They wanted it to be about the cool kids. The most successful character in anything I&#x27;d ever done was Jeff Spicoli in &quot;Fast Times&quot;. People think that&#x27;s because he was stoned and a surfer. But that&#x27;s not it. It&#x27;s because he&#x27;s positive. So I thought, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to write a character who&#x27;s positive and happy.&#x27; And that was Cher.&quot; Heckerling, having read the Jane Austen novel &quot;Emma&quot; in college and loving the title character&#x27;s positivity, decided to write the script around an Emma-like character, saying, &quot;I started to think, &#x27;What&#x27;s the larger context for that kind of a &#x27;nothing can go wrong&#x27; &#x27;always looks through rose colored glasses&#x27; kind of girl? So I tried to take all the things that were in this sort of pretty 1800s world and see what would that be like if it was in Beverly Hills.&quot;

As research for the script, Heckerling sat in on classes at Beverly Hills High School to get a feel for the student culture, commenting, &quot;...one thing I observed was these girls in a constant state of grooming.&quot; Ken Stovitz had become Heckerling&#x27;s agent at the time and told her the script had the potential to be a feature film after he read it. The finished script, which was titled &quot;No Worries&quot;, contained the main characters that would end up in the &quot;Clueless&quot; film. Twink Caplan, Heckerling&#x27;s friend who had worked with her on past projects, said film executives at Fox were wary of the story being too female-oriented to appeal to a large enough audience. &quot;It was obvious they didn&#x27;t get it. They thought the script needed more boys in it. They were afraid that if they focused on girls, we wouldn&#x27;t get any guys to see it. So it went into turnaround. It was dead&quot;, said Caplan.

Six months later, the script found its way to producer Scott Rudin, who gave it his stamp of approval. Rudin&#x27;s support led to increased interest in the script, and it became the subject of a bidding war between studios which was eventually won by Paramount Pictures. Heckerling was excited, as Paramount owned several major youth-centered television channels, such as MTV and Nickelodeon, which were suited to the film&#x27;s target demographic.

===Casting===
Heckerling first saw Alicia Silverstone in the Aerosmith music video for &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot; and kept her in the back of her mind for the role of Cher. When the film was still in development at Fox, executives suggested Alicia Witt, Keri Russell, Tiffani Thiessen, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie for the part. Heckerling met with Reese Witherspoon, who already had a few film roles to her credit. Though Silverstone only had the thriller &quot;The Crush&quot; as her previous film, the studio did not pressure Heckerling to cast big stars, and Silverstone ultimately won the role of Cher. Ben Affleck and Zach Braff auditioned for the role of Josh. Sarah Michelle Gellar was offered the role of Amber Mariens but turned it down due to her commitments to &quot;All My Children&quot;, while Zooey Deschanel auditioned for the role of Amber as well.

Seth Green auditioned for the role of Travis and Alanna Ubach was considered for the role of Tai. Terrence Howard and Dave Chappelle were considered for the role of Murray. Jeremy Renner and Jamie Walters auditioned for the role of Christian, and Jerry Orbach and Harvey Keitel were considered for the role of Cher&#x27;s father, Melvin Horowitz.

The character of Wendell Hall, played by Wallace Shawn, was inspired by a real-life debate teacher at Beverly Hills High School and a friend of Heckerling&#x27;s. Prior to full-time acting, Shawn had been a teacher and drew on his experience for his portrayal of Mr. Hall.

===Filming===
Principal photography for the film began on November 21, 1994, and consisted of a 40-day filming schedule. Brittany Murphy, who was 17 at the time, required a parent or guardian present during filming.

Scenes depicting the fictional Bronson Alcott High School campus including the tennis courts, outdoor cafeteria, and the quad were filmed at Occidental College in Los Angeles. Ulysses S. Grant High School in Valley Glen provided filming locations for the school&#x27;s interior sets. Other notable filming locations include the former Westside Pavilion shopping mall, Circus Liquor in North Hollywood, where Cher is mugged in her designer dress, and Rodeo Drive, featured in Cher&#x27;s &quot;crisis&quot; scene as she dejectedly wanders around after a failed driver&#x27;s test and a confrontation with Tai.

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones performance, originally an outdoor event, had to be moved inside due to rain. Paul Rudd bought everyone gifts after filming wrapped.

===Costumes===
Mona May did the costume designing for the film. The iconic plaid set worn by Cher Horowitz in the film was &quot;a nod to a Catholic schoolgirl uniform, but taken to another level and, turned designer.&quot; Cher wore several designer clothes ranging from Azzedine Alaïa to Anna Sui. The &quot;underwear&quot; Calvin Klein dress worn by Cher was actually designed by Sui who, at the time, was an emerging designer. Calvin Klein was credited due to more brand recognition during the time.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film became a surprise sleeper hit of 1995. &quot;Clueless&quot; opened in 1,653 theaters on July 19, 1995, and grossed $10,612,443 on its opening weekend, which led to a ranking of second at the US box office behind &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. The film grossed $56,631,572 during its theatrical run in the United States and Canada, becoming the 32nd-highest-grossing film of 1995. Internationally, it grossed $31 million for a worldwide total of $88 million. The box office success brought the then-largely unknown Silverstone to international attention and earned her a $10 million, multi-picture deal with Columbia TriStar. The film developed a strong cult following after its release.

===Critical reception===
The film was well received by critics. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 81% based on reviews from 120 critics, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A funny and clever reshaping of &quot;Emma&quot;, &quot;Clueless&quot; offers a soft satire that pokes as much fun at teen films as it does at the Beverly Hills glitterati.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a 71 out of 100 rating based on 18 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted, &quot;Even if &quot;Clueless&quot; runs out of gas before it&#x27;s over, most of it is as eye-catching and cheery as its star.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; contrasted the film to a more adult-oriented movie about teenagers released around the same time, &quot;Kids&quot;, stating, &quot;The materialism in &quot;Clueless&quot; is almost as scary as the hopelessness in &quot;Kids&quot;&quot;, but concluded &quot;Clueless&quot; is &quot;wicked good fun to be had [and] Silverstone is a winner.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Clueless&quot; won the award for Best Screenplay at the National Society of Film Critics Awards and Alicia Silverstone won the award for Breakthrough Performance from the National Board of Review. The film was nominated for a WGA Award for Best Screenplay. The film was nominated for four MTV Movie Awards, winning for Best Female Performance and Most Desirable Female for Silverstone. Silverstone won the award for Funniest Actress in a Motion Picture at the American Comedy Awards.

In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; selected &quot;Clueless&quot; as one of the &quot;New Classics&quot;, a list of 100 best films released between 1983 and 2008; &quot;Clueless&quot; was ranked 42nd. That year, the publication also named it the 19th-best comedy of the past 25 years. The film is ranked as number 7 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; list of the 50 best high school films.

==Comparison to &quot;Emma&quot;==
&quot;Clueless&quot; is a loose adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s 1815 novel &quot;Emma&quot;, and many of its characters have counterparts in the novel.
* Cher Horowitz/Emma Woodhouse: Cher is representative of the main character Emma Woodhouse. Spunky, carefree, entitled, perpetually single, and matchmaker extraordinaire, both Cher and Emma enjoy the satisfaction of helping those who are without love find a perfect match. This is first seen within the first fifteen minutes of the film when both she and Dionne pair their English teacher with the school&#x27;s Debate teacher. However, this is more prominently reflected when Cher does everything in her power to pair her newest friend Tai. While both Emma and Cher mean well in their matchmaking attempts, neither of them realizes the depths of her actions nor her feelings towards Josh/Mr. Knightley until Tai/Harriet asks her to set her up with Josh/Mr. Knightley.
* Josh Lucas/Mr. Knightley: Cher&#x27;s former stepbrother, whom she finds utterly repulsive. At the beginning of the movie, she states that she has no positive feelings towards Josh in the slightest. The two bicker continually. However, as the movie progresses, Josh is shown to be more caring and considerate towards Cher, becoming defensive towards her choices of men and in life. In the novel, Mr. Knightley is the brother of Emma&#x27;s sister&#x27;s husband and is Emma&#x27;s only critic. Cher/Emma and Josh/Mr. Knightley eventually realize they are in love.
* Tai Frasier/Harriet Smith: Tai, representative of the young, fair, and socially awkward Harriet Smith, is a newcomer to Bronson Alcott High School. Soon after, she is swept off her feet by both Cher and Dionne as they help her (unintentionally) become the most popular girl in school, to Cher&#x27;s dismay. At the beginning of the film, Tai is attracted to Travis, a well-meaning, skateboard-riding, pot-smoking social recluse. Harriet is likewise attracted to humble farmer Robert Martin. Each is pressured by Cher/Emma to reject her lower-status potential lover, instead being pushed towards Elton/Mr Elton. Disastrously for Cher, Tai then falls for Josh. Emma is likewise horrified when Harriet falls in love with Mr. Knightley. In both cases, this leads to the heroine examining her own true feelings.
* Mel Horowitz/Mr. Henry Woodhouse: Similarly to &quot;Emma&quot;, Mr. Horowitz is a well known and respected man within his circle of friends, though there is one major difference between both characters: while Mr. Horowitz is shown to have little to no care for his health, Mr. Woodhouse is considered to be a valetudinarian. Both characters are shown to love their daughters greatly while not always being so forward in their affection.
* Christian Stovitz/Frank Churchill: The initially appealing love interest of Cher, whom she convinces herself she must be in love with, similar to Frank Churchill in the book. In the book, Churchill is not available to Emma because he is secretly already engaged; in the film, Christian is not available to Cher because he is gay. Both characters engage in surface-level flirting with the heroine and make her consider her own feelings.
* Travis Birkenstock/Robert Martin: A stoner and skater who has a mutual attraction with Tai; however, their attempts at courtship are derailed for a time by Cher&#x27;s attempt to set Tai up with Elton. Travis is an underachiever, is constantly late for class and often receives poor grades. In the book, Emma considers Martin, a farmer, to be beneath Harriet.
* Elton Tiscia/Mr. Elton: Elton is a popular student whom Cher attempts to fix up with Tai. As is the case with the Elton from the book, he is not interested in Tai/Harriet and mistakenly believes that Cher/Emma is interested in him.
* Amber Mariens/Mrs. Elton: Cher&#x27;s antagonist, who is implied to be dating Elton after Cher turns down his advance, similar to Mr. Elton taking a wife after Emma rejects him.
* Miss Geist/Miss Taylor and Mr. Hall/Mr. Weston: The initial targets of Cher&#x27;s/Emma&#x27;s matchmaking.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
===Cast===
After the death of Brittany Murphy, Silverstone stated that she &quot;always felt connected to [Murphy] as [they] shared a very special experience in [their] lives together&quot;, and said, &quot;I loved working with Brittany. She was so talented, so warm, and so sweet.&quot;

Heckerling later described Silverstone as having &quot;that Marilyn Monroe thing&quot; as a &quot;pretty, sweet blonde who, in spite of being the American ideal, people still really like.&quot;

The surviving cast reunited in October 2012 for an issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

Heckerling later reunited with both Silverstone and Wallace Shawn for the 2012 vampire comedy film &quot;Vamps&quot;.

===Popular culture and society===
The film was well known for the characters&#x27; catchphrases and vocabulary. Cher&#x27;s verbal style is also marked by ironic contrasts between current slang and historical references, such as when she compares Tai to &quot;those Botticelli chicks&quot;.

The film also had a strong influence on fashion trends. Fashion as a form of self-expression played an important role in the narrative and character development of the film, television series, and novels, which are topics examined by academic Alice Leppert.

Donatella Versace&#x27;s fall 2018 collection was influenced by &quot;Clueless&quot;.

&quot;Clueless&quot; was the main inspiration for Australian rapper Iggy Azalea&#x27;s music video for her 2014 song &quot;Fancy&quot; featuring Charli XCX. Many visuals and costumes inspired by the film were used in the video, which is filled with remakes of &quot;Clueless&quot; scenes. The outfits are also reinvented to channel the famous stylings of the film with a slightly modern edge. &quot;Fancy&quot; was shot in the same Los Angeles high school where &quot;Clueless&quot; was filmed. A June 2018 episode of &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot; featured Silverstone miming to &quot;Fancy&quot;, wearing Cher&#x27;s yellow plaid skirt suit.

A reference to Cher&#x27;s seduction of Christian is included in the music video for Simone Battle&#x27;s &quot;He Likes Boys&quot; (2011).

In the second episode of the second season of the BBC America thriller series &quot;Killing Eve&quot;, &quot;Nice and Neat&quot; (2019), the Russian assassin Villanelle calls her agency and uses the codename Cher Horowitz to secretly inform her boss she is in trouble and needs to be rescued after being kidnapped.

A 2020 Discover Card commercial featured a clip from the film consisting of Cher Horowitz saying her famous phrase &quot;Uh! As if!&quot;.

In 2023, Silverstone once again reprised the role of Cher Horowitz in a commercial for Rakuten which debuted during Super Bowl LVII.

==Spin-offs and adaptations==
===Television===
In 1996, the producers created a spin-off television series, which followed parallel storylines of Cher and her friends. Several cast members from the film went on to star in the series, with the notable exceptions of Silverstone and Rudd, whose film careers had begun to take off. Silverstone was replaced in the series with actress Rachel Blanchard.

In October 2019, it was announced that CBS would be adapting the film into a drama series. The series is said to be centered around Dionne Davenport after Cher goes missing, and is described by &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; as a &quot;baby pink and bisexual blue-tinted, tiny sunglasses-wearing, oat milk latte and Adderall-fueled look at what happens when the high school queen bee Cher disappears and her lifelong number two Dionne steps into Cher&#x27;s vacant Air Jordans.&quot; On August 14, 2020, it was moved to NBCUniversal&#x27;s streaming service Peacock. In May 2021, it was reported that the series would not be moving forward at Peacock and instead would be redeveloping at CBS Studios.

===Books===
Simon Spotlight Entertainment spun off a collection of paperback books from 1995 to 1999 aimed at adolescent readers.

In 2015, to celebrate the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, pop culture writer Jen Chaney published a book titled &quot;As If!: The Oral History of Clueless&quot;. The book is based on exclusive interviews with Heckerling, Silverstone, and other cast and crew members. Excerpts from the book were published in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

===Comics===
A comic book series was launched in 2017.

===Stage musical===
&quot;Clueless: The Musical&quot; opened in New York City on December 11, 2018, as part of The New Group&#x27;s 2018–2019 season. The show was written by Heckerling and starred Dove Cameron as Cher and Dave Thomas Brown as Josh. It closed on January 12, 2019.

The musical was a jukebox musical featuring pop songs from the 1990s, though with lyrics mostly or entirely rewritten by Heckerling to fit the storyline. Songs adapted from the film&#x27;s soundtrack included &quot;Supermodel&quot; and &quot;Kids in America&quot;.

===Video games===
The &quot;Clueless&quot; CD-ROM is an activity and mini game collection based on the Clueless film and television series released by Mattel Media in 1997 for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh. The CD-ROM is intended for girls age 8 and up, and includes a soundtrack, trivia, makeover and dress-up activities, and six video games.

Paramount announced in 2008 that they would release video games based on their films &quot;Clueless&quot;, &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, and &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;. The games were planned to be released on both the PC and the Nintendo DS, but only the PC games were released. &quot;Clueless&quot; on PC was released in 2009. The cancelled Nintendo DS video game was found by YouTuber Ray Mona, and a full play-through of the game was released on her channel on April 1, 2021.

In 2017, &quot;Episode&quot; launched an interactive animated web story based on the film.

<text>Maranta arundinacea, also known as arrowroot, maranta, West Indian arrowroot, obedience plant or Bermuda arrowroot is a large, perennial herb found in rainforest habitats of the Americas, but cultivated in tropical regions worldwide.

==Description==

Arrowroot is a perennial plant growing to a height of between and . Its leaves are lanceolate. The edible part of the plant is the rhizome. Twin clusters of small white flowers bloom about 90 days after planting. The plant rarely produces seeds and reproduction is typically by planting part of a rhizome with a bud. Rhizomes are ready for harvesting 10–12 months after planting as the leaves of the plant begin to wilt and die. The rhizomes are fleshy, cylindrical, and grow from to long.

The arrowroot plant probably originated in the Amazon rainforest of northwestern Brazil and neighboring countries. It grows best between temperatures of and with annual precipitation between and . The dormant rhizomes can withstand temperatures as low as .

In the continental United States, arrowroot is cultivated as an outside plant only in southern Florida.

&quot;Maranta arundinacea&quot; is native to Mexico, Central America, the West Indies (Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and most of the Lesser Antilles) and South America (in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Suriname, Guyana, and French Guiana). It is widely cultivated in many warm countries and is considered naturalized in The Bahamas, Bermuda, Cambodia, China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Yunnan), the Cook Islands, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan (in the Volcano Islands), Mauritius, the Netherlands Antilles, Réunion, Samoa, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago, Tonga, the United States (Florida), the Philippines and Vanuatu.

The Caribbean island nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines is the world&#x27;s largest grower of arrowroot and producer of arrowroot flour. 
In Kerala, India, arrowroot, locally called ബിലാത്തി കൂവ (Bilathi Kūva), is cultivated to produce an easily digestible starch., while in Odisha, India, it&#x27;s called ପାଳୁଅ (Paḷua).

==Prehistoric domestication==
Radio-carbon dating has established that &quot;M. arundinacea&quot; was one of the first plants domesticated in prehistoric South America. Arrowroot, along with leren (&quot;Goeppertia allouia&quot;), squash (&quot;Cucurbita moschata&quot;), and bottle gourd (&quot;Lagenaria siceraria&quot;) became cultivated plants in northern South American and Panama between 8200 BC and 5600 BC. Some archaeologists believe that arrowroot was first used by indigenous peoples not as food but as a poultice to extract poison from wounds caused by spears or arrows.

Evidence of the use of arrowroot as food has been found dating from 8200 BC at the San Isidro archaeological site in the upper Cauca River valley of Colombia near the city of Popayán. Starch grains from arrowroot were found on grinding tools. It is unclear whether the arrowroot had been gathered or grown, although the elevation of the site of is probably outside the normal range of elevations at which &quot;M. arundinacea&quot; grows in the wild. Thus, the plant may have been introduced at San Isidro from nearby lowland rainforest areas in a pioneering effort to cultivate it. Stone hoes for the cultivation of plants have been found which date as old as 7700 BCE in the middle Cauca valley, north of San Isidro.

Domestication of arrowroot at these early dates was probably on a small scale with gardens of only a few plants being planted in alluvial soils near streams to ensure the steady supply of moisture needed during the growing season of arrowroot and other similar root crops. The exploitation of arrowroot was probably complicated by the difficulty of extracting the starch from the fibrous roots. The roots must first be pounded or ground then soaked in water to separate the starch from the fibers. The starch is excellent for digestibility.

==Uses==
Currently, arrowroot starch is used in food preparations and confectionery, and for industrial applications such as cosmetics and glue. The residue of starch extraction has a high fibre content and can be fed to livestock.

<text>NatureScot () is the operating name for the body formally called Scottish Natural Heritage. It is an executive non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government responsible for the country&#x27;s natural heritage, especially its natural, genetic and scenic diversity. It advises the Scottish Government on nature conservation, and acts as a government agent in the delivery of conservation designations, i.e. national nature reserves, local nature reserves, national parks, Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas and the national scenic areas. It receives annual funding from the Government in the form of Grant in Aid to deliver Government priorities for the natural heritage.

NatureScot is the Scottish Government&#x27;s adviser on all aspects of nature, wildlife management and landscape across Scotland, and also helps the Scottish Government meet its responsibilities under European environmental laws, particularly in relation to the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. The agency currently employs in the region of 700 people, but much of NatureScot&#x27;s work is carried out in partnership with others including local authorities, Government bodies, voluntary environmental bodies, community groups, farmers and land managers. The body has offices in most parts of Scotland including the main islands. NatureScot works closely with the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and the equivalent bodies for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland to ensure a consistent approach to nature conservation throughout the United Kingdom and towards fulfilling its international obligations.

The agency was formed in 1992 as Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). In November 2019 it was announced that SNH would be re-branded as NatureScot, however its legal persona and statutory functions would remain unchanged. The change took effect on 24 August 2020.

==Roles and responsibilities==
The general aims of NatureScot as established in the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Act 1991 are to: 
* Secure the conservation and enhancement of Scotland&#x27;s natural heritage;
* Foster understanding and facilitate the enjoyment of Scotland&#x27;s natural heritage;
For the purposes of the Act, Scotland&#x27;s natural heritage is defined as the flora and fauna of Scotland, its geological and physiographical features and its natural beauty and amenity. Specific responsibilities of NatureScot include:
* Providing advice to the Scottish government on the development and implementation of policies relevant to the natural heritage of Scotland;
* Disseminating information and advice relating to the natural heritage of Scotland to the public;
* Carrying out and commissioning research relating to the natural heritage of Scotland;
* Establishing, maintaining and managing designated areas of conservation in Scotland;

=== Protected areas ===

NatureScot has responsibility for the delivery of conservation designations in Scotland, i.e. national nature reserves, local nature reserves, long distance routes, national parks, Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas and the national scenic areas. The conservation designations overlap considerably with many protected areas covered by multiple designations. In total around 20% of the area of Scotland is covered by some form of protected area designation, with SSSIs alone covering 13%. 

==== National nature reserves ====
National nature reserves (NNRs) are areas of land or water designated under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to contain habitats and species of national importance. NNRs can be owned by public, private, community or voluntary organisations but must be managed to conserve their important habitats and species, as well as providing opportunities for the public to enjoy and engage with nature. There are currently 43 NNRs in Scotland, which cover .

NatureScot is responsible for designating NNRs in Scotland and for overseeing their maintenance and management. The majority of NNRs are directly managed by NatureScot; however, some are managed by, or in co-operation with other bodies, including the National Trust for Scotland (7 NNRs), Forestry and Land Scotland (5 NNRs), the RSPB (5 NNRs), the Scottish Wildlife Trust (1 NNR), South Lanarkshire Council (1 NNR), and the Woodland Trust (1 NNR).

All NNRs in Scotland are also designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Many also form part of the Natura 2000 network, which covers Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation. Additionally, some of the NNRs are designated as Ramsar sites.

==== National scenic areas ====
There are 40 national scenic areas (NSAs) in Scotland, covering 13% of the land area of Scotland. The 40 NSAs were originally identified in 1978 by the Countryside Commission for Scotland in 1978 as areas of &quot;national scenic significance... of unsurpassed attractiveness which must be conserved as part of our national heritage&quot;.

=== Protected species ===

Vulnerable plant and animal species in Scotland are protected under various legislation. In many cases it is an offence to kill or capture members of a protected animal species, or to uproot plants. NatureScot&#x27;s primary role in regard to protected species is to license activities that would otherwise be an offence.

=== Enjoying the outdoors ===
NatureScot is responsible for promoting public access and enjoyment of the outdoors. It created and updates the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, which provides detailed guidance on the exercise of the ancient tradition of universal access to land in Scotland, which was formally codified by the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. It also hosts the National Access Forum, which brings together all bodies with an interest in land access issues.

NatureScot also support the management of the three regional parks. It acts as the &quot;custodian&quot; of Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails, maintaining the official list and providing some finance and publicity to the trails, although responsibility for creating and maintaining each route lies with the local authorities through which a route passes.

== Governance ==
NatureScot is governed by its board. As of August 2022, the board is made up of twelve members and is chaired by Prof Colin Galbraith. Board members are appointed by Scottish Government ministers for an initial term of four years and normally serve a maximum of two terms. The primary roles of the board are to determine the objectives, strategies and policies of NatureScot in respect to its statutory obligations and guidance from the Scottish Government. Meetings of the NatureScot Board are open to the public to attend as observers.

Day-to-day operations are led by the Senior Leadership Team, consisting of a chief executive, who is appointed by the board, and a number of directors and deputy directors. the Senior Leadership Team comprised:

*Chief Executive and Accountable Officer: Francesca Osowska
*Director of Business Services and Transformation: Jane Macdonald
*Director of Green Economy: Robbie Kernahan
*Director of Nature and Climate Change: Nick Halfhide
*Deputy Director of Green Economy: Claudia Rowse
*Deputy Director of Nature and Climate Change: Eileen Stuart
*Head of External Affairs: Jason Ormiston
*Deputy Director of Business Services and Transformation: Stuart MacQuarrie

Supporting the Board are three committee, the Scientific Advisory Committee, the Protected Areas Committee, and the Audit and Risk Committee.

NatureScot programmes and priorities have a strong focus on helping to deliver the Scottish Government&#x27;s National Outcomes and Targets which comprise the National Performance Framework. NatureScot is also a member of SEARS (Scotland&#x27;s Environmental and Rural Services).

==History==

The agency was formed as Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) in 1992 from the amalgamation of the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland and the Countryside Commission for Scotland to &quot;secure the conservation and enhancement of, and to foster understanding and facilitate the enjoyment of the natural heritage of Scotland&quot;.

In March 2003, Scottish Ministers announced their decision to transfer SNH&#x27;s headquarters from Edinburgh to Inverness, with around 270 jobs to be transferred. Prior to the move, relocation costs were variously estimated at between £22 million and £40 million. The decision to transfer SNH&#x27;s headquarters was heavily criticized by MSPs, unions, Edinburgh civic leaders and staff. Criticism focused on the cost of the move, the disruption to staff and the risk of compromising the effectiveness of SNH&#x27;s work. Up to 75% of headquarters staff were reported to be against the move. Relocation took place between 2003 and 2006, many staff left at this point as they did not wish to, or were unable to transfer location.

In 2006, SNH headquarters staff moved into Great Glen House, a £15 million purpose-built headquarters building in Inverness. Great Glen House was built by Robertson Property, working with Keppie Design. As part of the tendering process, SNH set seven environmental and sustainability criteria for the design including achieving an &#x27;Excellent&#x27; rating under the BREEAM system. The final design met all criteria and achieved the highest ever BREEAM rating for a public building in the UK.

On 1 August 2010, the functions of the Deer Commission for Scotland were transferred to SNH by section 1 of the Public Services (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2010 and the Commission was dissolved.

In 2020 SNH was re-branded as NatureScot.

==Projects==
In support of its statutory duties, NatureScot undertakes many individual projects across Scotland, often in collaboration with land managers, charities and local communities.

===Stoat eradication project===
The introduction of alien stoats since 2010 has created serious problems for native species in Orkney:
In 2018, a stoat eradication project was presented by NatureScot to be applied &quot;across Orkney Mainland, South Ronaldsay, Burray, Glimps Holm, Lamb Holm and Hunda, and the biosecurity activities delivered on the non-linked islands of the archipelago&quot;. The project, which is run by a partnership including NatureScot, RSPB Scotland and Orkney Islands Council, uses &quot;humane DOC150 and DOC200 traps&quot;. A report issued in October 2020 stated that over 5,000 traps had been deployed. Specifics were provided as to the locations.

Not all was going well as of 15 January 2021, according to The Times which stated that the project &quot;has been hit by alleged sabotage after the destruction and theft of traps that have also killed and injured household pets and other animals&quot; but added that the £6 million programme was supported by most islanders. Another news item stated that some of the traps had &quot;caught and killed family pets as well as hundreds of other animals&quot;. A subsequent report confirmed that &quot;Police Scotland is investigating a number of incidents involving damage to and the theft of stoat traps in Orkney&quot;.

<text>A national scenic area (NSA) is a conservation designation used in several countries.

==China==
==Taiwan==
Some of the national scenic areas in Taiwan are:
* Alishan National Scenic Area in Chiayi County
* Maolin National Scenic Area in Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County
* Northeast and Yilan Coast National Scenic Area in New Taipei City and Yilan County
* Penghu National Scenic Area in Penghu County
* Siraya National Scenic Area in Chiayi County and Tainan City
* Southwest Coast National Scenic Area in Chiayi County, Tainan City and Yunlin County

==United Kingdom==
In Scotland national scenic areas (NSAs) are defined as areas having outstanding scenic interest or unsurpassed attractiveness. They are administered by NatureScot. There are 40 designated NSAs in Scotland, covering 13% of the country&#x27;s land area. The primary purpose of the NSA designations is to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the landscape, in a similar way to the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) designation used elsewhere in the UK. AONBs were created under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, which applies to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This act allows areas of countryside with significant landscape value in each of the three nations to be designated by their respective governments.

==Great Britain==
In Great Britain, nature reserves designed under Part III of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 that are deemed to be of national importance may be designated as statutory &#x27;national nature reserves&#x27; by the relevant national nature conservation body (Natural England, Scottish Natural Heritage, or Natural Resources Wales) using section 35(1) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

If a nature reserve is designated by a local authority in Great Britain, then the resulting statutory nature reserve will be referred to as a local nature reserve.

===England===
In England, 229 national nature reserves are designated by Natural England.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, 43 national nature reserves are designated by NatureScot.

===Wales===
In Wales, 76 national nature reserves are designated by Natural Resources Wales.

<doc id="105883" wikidata="Q454119" url="?curid=105883" title="Julie Brown">
<text>Julie Ann Brown (born August 31, 1958) is an American actress, comedian, screen/television writer, singer-songwriter, and television director. Brown is known for her work in the 1980s, when she often played a quintessential valley girl character. Much of her comedy has revolved around the mocking of famous people (with a strong and frequently revisited focus on Madonna).

==Early life==
Julie Brown was born in Van Nuys, California, the daughter of Irish-Catholic parents Celia Jane (née McCann) and Leonard Francis Brown. Her father worked at NBC TV studios in the traffic department (advertising scheduling), and her mother was a secretary at the same studio complex. Both of Brown&#x27;s grandfathers had worked in the Hollywood film business. Her great-grandfather was character actor Frank O&#x27;Connor. She attended a Catholic elementary school as a child, and later Van Nuys High School, where she was chosen princess of the homecoming court. Brown&#x27;s parents said, &quot;whatever you do, don&#x27;t become an actress&quot;, but after attending Los Angeles Valley College, she enrolled in the well-known San Francisco acting school, American Conservatory Theater, where she met future collaborator Charlie Coffey.

==Career==
Julie Brown began her career performing in nightclubs. She was a contestant on the game show &quot;Whew!&quot; (as Annie Brown). She started working on television with a guest spot on the sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;. She also appeared in the 1981 cult film &quot;Bloody Birthday&quot;. After a small role in the Clint Eastwood comedy film &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot;, comedian Lily Tomlin saw Brown at a comedy club and gave her her first big break, a part in her 1981 film &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot;. Tomlin and Brown eventually became close friends. A string of guest-starring appearances in a variety of television shows followed, including: &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, and &quot;Newhart&quot;. Brown also appeared in short films such as &quot;Five Minutes, Miss Brown&quot;.

In 1984, she released her first EP, a five-song album called &quot;Goddess in Progress&quot;. The album, parodies of popular &#x27;80s music combined with her valley-girl personality, was quickly discovered by the &quot;Dr. Demento Show&quot;. The songs &quot;&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m a Blonde&quot; and &quot;The Homecoming Queen&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot; were given radio airplay around the world. The latter was a spoof on stereotypical 1950s&#x27; teen tragedy songs, with cheerleaders&#x27; heads and pompoms being blown to pieces.

In 1987, Brown released her first full-length album, &quot;Trapped in the Body of a White Girl&quot;. The album highlighted her comedic talent and valley girl personality. The album&#x27;s highlights were &quot;I Like &#x27;em Big and Stupid&quot; and she reprised &quot;The Homecoming Queen&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot; (the album was reissued on CD in 2010 by Collector&#x27;s Choice Music on its Noble Rot label). Music videos were recorded and received heavy airplay on MTV. In 1989, Brown starred in that cable network&#x27;s comedy and music-video show &quot;Just Say Julie&quot;. She played the role of a demanding, controlling, and pessimistic glamour-puss from the valley, making fun of popular music acts, while at the same time introducing their music videos (she was also known as &quot;Miss Julie Brown&quot; at the time to differentiate her from Downtown Julie Brown, who was on the network at the same time).

Brown&#x27;s film career began in 1988 with the release of the film &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;, written, produced by, and featuring Brown, it was based loosely on a song by the same name from her debut EP. The film also starred Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. Brown cast then-unknown comedians Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans. In 1990, Brown had a brief part in the film &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;, as an intellectual stripper.
NBC commissioned a half-hour pilot, ultimately unsold and airing Sunday, July 28, 1991, at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, titled &quot;The Julie Show&quot;. Created by Brown, Charlie Coffey, and director and executive producer David Mirkin, it was a comedy about actress Julie Robbins (Brown), who in this initial story, goes to great lengths to land an interview with teen singer Kiki (played by Kim Walker) in the hopes of getting hired as a tabloid-TV celebrity journalist. Developed under the working title &quot;The Julie Brown Show&quot;, it also starred Marian Mercer as Julie&#x27;s mother, June; DeLane Matthews as Debra Deacon, a reporter on the fictional series &quot;Inside Scoop&quot;; Susan Messing as Julie&#x27;s roommate Cheryl; and Kevin O&#x27;Rourke as &quot;Inside Scoop&quot; producer Tony Barnow. Brown was also a producer, with John Ziffren, and performed and co-wrote the theme song. Walker, Don Sparks, Robin Angers, and Deborah Driggs were guest performers in this production from Mirkinvision and New World Television.

Another pilot was filmed for CBS in 1989 called, &quot;Julie Brown: The Show&quot;, and featured a similar theme, in which Brown was the hostess of a talk show and she would interview actual celebrity guests, interspersed with scripted scenarios. The pilot was aired, but the show was not picked up; years later, it leaked onto the Internet.

In 1992, Brown starred in her own Fox sketch comedy show, &quot;The Edge&quot;; two of its regulars, Jennifer Aniston and Wayne Knight, later became sitcom stars, while Tom Kenny went on to voice &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. That same year, she released the Showtime television film &quot;&quot;, a satire about Madonna and her backstage documentary, &quot;&quot;.

Brown followed with another satire, &quot;Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 In. Women&quot;, which lampooned the violence of ice skater Tonya Harding toward rival Nancy Kerrigan, as well as that of widely publicized mutilator Lorena Bobbitt.

She has continued to make television guest appearances and contributed voices to various cartoons, including &quot;Animaniacs&quot; (as the voice of Minerva Mink), &quot;Aladdin&quot; as bratty mermaid Saleen, and as the original voice of Zatanna in the &quot;&quot; cartoon. Prior to this, she also guest-starred on a &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; episode as Julie Bruin, a cartoon bear version of herself, in which she guest-starred in her own segment &quot;Just Say Julie Bruin&quot;, a reference to her music video show. This cartoon also was a music video show, and in her segment, Elmer Fudd guest-starred as Fuddonna, a parody of Madonna and a reference to Julie Brown herself regularly mocking her.

Brown appeared as Coach Millie Stoeger in the film &quot;Clueless&quot;, reprising that role on ABC&#x27;s 1996–1999 spin-off TV series, for which she was also a writer, producer, and director. Two regulars from the series, Donald Faison and Elisa Donovan, later found similarly successful roles, as would featured player Christina Milian, who had a recurring role on the series during its UPN years. In 1998, Brown appeared in the parody film &quot;Plump Fiction&quot;. In 2000, she created the series &quot;Strip Mall&quot; for the Comedy Central network; it ran two seasons.

Since 2004, Brown has been a commentator on E! network specials, including &quot;101 Reasons the &#x27;90s Ruled&quot;, &quot;101 Most Starlicious Makeovers&quot;, &quot;101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment&quot;, and &quot;50 Most Outrageous TV Moments&quot;.

In 2005, Brown purchased the rights to her &quot;Trapped&quot; album back from the record label and reissued it herself. She also self-released a single, &quot;I Want to Be Gay&quot;. In late 2007, she also purchased the rights to her 1984 E.P. &quot;Goddess in Progress&quot; and re-released it as a full-length record with compiled unreleased tracks recorded during that era. Brown began touring in late 2007 with her one-woman show, &quot;Smell the Glamour&quot;.

In 2008, she co-wrote and appeared as Dee La Duke in the Disney Channel film &quot;Camp Rock&quot;, which starred Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers. Brown also joined the cast of the Canadian television series &quot;Paradise Falls&quot; that same year.

In late 2008, Brown began releasing one-track digital singles, starting with &quot;The Ex-Beauty Queen&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot;; it was a rewrite of &quot;Homecoming Queen&quot; with lyrics about Sarah Palin. This was first aired in September, 2008, on &quot;The Stephanie Miller Show.&quot; In 2011, she released an album called &quot;Smell the Glamour&quot;, which features satires of Lady Gaga and Kesha, and updated versions of her &quot;Medusa&quot; songs.

In the 2010–2011 television season, Brown began a recurring role as Paula Norwood, a neighbor and friend of the Heck family, on the ABC comedy &quot;The Middle&quot;. From 2010 to 2015, she was a writer for &quot;Melissa &amp; Joey&quot;, and played a gym teacher in one episode of the show. In 2012, she appeared with Downtown Julie Brown as a guest judge on &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;.

In 2023, amid the announcement of The Celebration Tour, in which Madonna recreated a video inspired by her film &quot;Madonna: Truth or Dare&quot;, Brown reprised her Medusa character parodying the announcement video in her social media.

==Personal life==
In 1983, Brown married writer and actor Terrence E. McNally, another frequent collaborator. They co-produced her first single, &quot;I Like &#x27;Em Big and Stupid&quot;. They divorced after six years. In 1994, Brown married Ken Rathjen, and together they have one son. She said in 2007 that she had recently divorced for the second time.

<text>Llívia (; ) is a town in the &quot;comarca&quot; of Cerdanya, province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain. It is a Spanish exclave surrounded by the French &quot;département&quot; of Pyrénées-Orientales. 

In 2023, the municipality of Llívia had a total population of 1,511. It is separated from the rest of Spain by a corridor about wide, which includes the French communes of Ur and Bourg-Madame. The Segre river, a tributary of the Spanish Ebro, flows through Llívia.

==History==
Llívia was the site of an Iberian oppidum that commanded the region and was named &quot;Julia Lybica&quot; by the Romans. It was the capital of Cerdanya in antiquity, before being replaced by Hix (commune of Bourg-Madame, France) in the Middle Ages. During the Visigothic period, its citadel, the &quot;castrum Libiae&quot;, was held by the rebel Paul of Narbonne against King Wamba in 672. As the &quot;town (or &#x27;city&#x27;) of Cerdanya,&quot; 8th century Llívia may also have been the scene of the siege by which governor Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi of Muslim Spain rid himself of the Moorish (Berber) rebel Uthman ibn Naissa (&quot;Munnuza&quot;), who had allied himself with Duke Eudo of Aquitaine to improve the chances of his rebellion, ahead of the Battle of Tours (732 or 733), also known as the Battle of Poitiers.

Following the Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659), the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 ceded the &quot;comarques&quot; of Roussillon, Conflent, Capcir, Vallespir, and northern Cerdanya (&quot;Cerdagne&quot;) to the French Crown. The treaty thus established the Pyrenees as the border between France and Spain, while separating Northern Catalonia from Catalonia. However, the treaty stipulated that only villages were to be ceded to France, and Llívia was considered a town (&quot;vila&quot; in Catalan), since it had the status of the ancient capital of Cerdanya. So Llívia remained a Spanish enclave within France and did not become part of the Kingdom of France. This situation was confirmed in the subsequent Treaty of Llívia, signed in 1660.

Under the Nationalist government of Francisco Franco, residents required special passes to cross France to the rest of Spain. Today, with these countries in the Schengen Area, there are no frontier formalities and cross-border infrastructure is the only issue. The two countries share a hospital in Llívia, as well as other local initiatives.

The enclave is accessible from Spain via a 1.8 km (1 mile) long road that up until the implementation of the Schengen Area in 1995 was considered a &quot;neutral road&quot; as defined in the Treaty of Llívia. The road was designated as being a custom-free route across which the French were allowed free access from one part of the corridor to another and for the Spanish to travel freely between Puigcerdà and Llívia. This road is the joint property of Spain and France and is designated in Spain as part of the N-154 and in France as jointly part of the Route nationale 20 and the RD68. The road has been the subject of controversy over the years, particularly due to a number of stop signs placed by the French authorities and removed overnight by those opposed to them. This lasted for several years and became known as the war of the stop signs.

During the vote for Catalan independence in 2017, 561 out of 591 votes cast in Llívia were in favor of independence. The referendum was deemed illegal by the Spanish courts, but the Spanish police did not intervene to stop the vote in the town.

==Museum==

The Esteve Pharmacy, located in Llívia&#x27;s municipal museum, is a complete 18th-century pharmacy donated to the town by the family who owned it, on condition the contents remain in the town. There are records of pharmacists practising in Llívia since medieval times. The pharmacy has a large display of albarelli, a type of ceramic jar used in pharmacies, as well as antique drugs, and one of the most important collections of prescription books in Europe.

==Education==

Escola Jaume I is located in Llívia. It was built in the 1950s. a new school was constructed with a ground floor and a second floor.

<doc id="105888" wikidata="Q1340341" url="?curid=105888" title="The End of History and the Last Man">
<text>The End of History and the Last Man is a 1992 book of political philosophy by American political scientist Francis Fukuyama which argues that with the ascendancy of Western liberal democracy—which occurred after the Cold War (1945–1991) and the dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991)—humanity has reached &quot;not just... the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such: That is, the end-point of mankind&#x27;s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.&quot;

Fukuyama draws upon the philosophies and ideologies of G. W. F. Hegel and Karl Marx, who define human history as a linear progression, from one socioeconomic epoch to another. 

The book expands on Fukuyama&#x27;s essay &quot;The End of History?&quot;, published in &quot;The National Interest&quot; journal, Summer 1989.

== Overview ==

Fukuyama argues that history should be viewed as an evolutionary process, and that the end of history, in this sense, means that liberal democracy is the final form of government for all nations. According to Fukuyama, since the French Revolution, liberal democracy has repeatedly proven to be a fundamentally better system (ethically, politically, economically) than any of the alternatives, and so there can be no progression from it to an alternative system. Fukuyama claims not that events will stop occurring in the future, but rather that all that will happen in the future (even if totalitarianism returns) is that democracy will become more and more prevalent in the long term.

Some argue that Fukuyama presents &quot;American-style&quot; democracy as the only &quot;correct&quot; political system and argues that all countries must inevitably follow this particular system of government. However, many Fukuyama scholars claim this is a misreading of his work. Fukuyama&#x27;s argument is only that in the future there will be more and more governments that use the framework of parliamentary democracy and that contain markets of some sort. He has said:

&quot;The End of History&quot; was never linked to a specifically American model of social or political organization. Following Alexandre Kojève, the Russian-French philosopher who inspired my original argument, I believe that the European Union more accurately reflects what the world will look like at the end of history than the contemporary United States. The EU&#x27;s attempt to transcend sovereignty and traditional power politics by establishing a transnational rule of law is much more in line with a &quot;post-historical&quot; world than the Americans&#x27; continuing belief in God, national sovereignty, and their military.

==Arguments in favor==
An argument in favor of Fukuyama&#x27;s thesis is the democratic peace theory, which argues that mature democracies rarely or never go to war with one another. This theory has faced criticism, with arguments largely resting on conflicting definitions of &quot;war&quot; and &quot;mature democracy&quot;. Part of the difficulty in assessing the theory is that democracy as a widespread global phenomenon emerged only very recently in human history, which makes generalizing about it difficult. (See also list of wars between democracies.)

Other major empirical evidence includes the elimination of interstate warfare in South America, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe among countries that moved from military dictatorship to liberal democracies.

According to several studies, the end of the Cold War and the subsequent increase in the number of liberal democratic states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total warfare, interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, and the number of refugees and displaced persons.

==Criticisms==

===Jacques Derrida===
In &quot;Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International&quot; (1993), Jacques Derrida criticized Fukuyama as a &quot;come-lately reader&quot; of the philosopher-statesman Alexandre Kojève (1902–1968), who &quot;in the tradition of Leo Strauss&quot; (1899–1973), in the 1950s, already had described the society of the U.S. as the &quot;realization of communism&quot;; and said that the public-intellectual celebrity of Fukuyama and the mainstream popularity of his book, &quot;The End of History and the Last Man&quot;, were symptoms of right-wing, cultural anxiety about ensuring the &quot;Death of Marx&quot;. In criticising Fukuyama&#x27;s celebration of the economic and cultural hegemony of Western liberalism, Derrida said:

Therefore, Derrida said: &quot;This end of History is essentially a Christian eschatology. It is consonant with the current discourse of the Pope on the European Community: Destined to become [either] a Christian State or [a] Super-State; [but] this community would still belong, therefore, to some Holy Alliance&quot;; that Fukuyama practised an intellectual &quot;sleight-of-hand trick&quot;, by using empirical data whenever suitable to his message, and by appealing to an abstract ideal whenever the empirical data contradicted his end-of-history thesis; and that Fukuyama sees the United States and the European Union as imperfect political entities, when compared to the distinct ideals of liberal democracy and of the free market, but understands that such abstractions (ideals) are not demonstrated with empirical evidence, nor ever could be empirically demonstrated, because they are philosophical and religious abstractions that originated from the Gospels of Philosophy of Hegel; and yet, Fukuyama still uses empirical observations to prove his thesis, which he, himself, agrees are imperfect and incomplete, to validate his end-of-history thesis, which remains an abstraction.

===Radical Islam, tribalism, and the &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot;===
Various Western commentators have described the thesis of &quot;The End of History&quot; as flawed because it does not sufficiently take into account the power of ethnic loyalties and religious fundamentalism as a counter-force to the spread of liberal democracy, with the specific example of Islamic fundamentalism, or radical Islam, as the most powerful of these.

Benjamin Barber wrote a 1992 article and a 1995 book, &quot;Jihad vs. McWorld&quot;, that addressed this theme. Barber described &quot;McWorld&quot; as a secular, liberal, corporate-friendly transformation of the world and used the word &quot;jihad&quot; to refer to the competing forces of tribalism and religious fundamentalism, with a special emphasis on Islamic fundamentalism.

Samuel P. Huntington wrote a 1993 essay, &quot;The Clash of Civilizations&quot;, in direct response to &quot;The End of History&quot;; he then expanded the essay into a 1996 book, &quot;The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order&quot;. In the essay and book, Huntington argued that the temporary conflict between ideologies is being replaced by the ancient conflict between civilizations. The dominant civilization decides the form of human government, and these will not be constant. He especially singled out Islam, which he described as having &quot;bloody borders&quot;.

After the September 11 attacks, &quot;The End of History&quot; was cited by some commentators as a symbol of the supposed naiveté and undue optimism of the Western world during the 1990s, in thinking that the end of the Cold War also represented the end of major global conflict. In the weeks after the attacks, Fareed Zakaria called the events &quot;the end of the end of history&quot;, while George Will wrote that history had &quot;returned from vacation&quot;.

Fukuyama did discuss radical Islam briefly in &quot;The End of History&quot;. He argued that Islam is not an imperialist force like Stalinism and fascism; that is, it has little intellectual or emotional appeal outside the Islamic &quot;heartlands&quot;. Fukuyama pointed to the economic and political difficulties that Iran and Saudi Arabia face and argued that such states are fundamentally unstable: either they will become democracies with a Muslim society (like Turkey) or they will simply disintegrate. Moreover, when Islamic states have actually been created, they were easily dominated by the powerful Western states.

In October 2001, Fukuyama, in a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; opinion piece, responded to criticism of his thesis after the September 11 attacks, saying, &quot;I believe that in the end I remain right&quot;. He explained that what he meant by &quot;End of History&quot; was the evolution of human political system, toward that of the &quot;liberal-democratic West&quot;. He also noted that his original thesis &quot;does not imply a world free from conflict, nor the disappearance of culture as a distinguishing characteristic of societies&quot;.

===The resurgence of Russia and China===
Another challenge to the &quot;end of history&quot; thesis is the growth in the economic and political power of two countries, Russia and China. China has a one-party state government, while Russia, though formally a democracy, is often described as an autocracy; it is categorized as an anocracy in the Polity data series.

Azar Gat, Professor of National Security at Tel Aviv University, argued this point in his 2007 &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; article, &quot;The Return of Authoritarian Great Powers&quot;, stating that the success of these two countries could &quot;end the end of history&quot;. Gat also discussed radical Islam, but stated that the movements associated with it &quot;represent no viable alternative to modernity and pose no significant military threat to the developed world&quot;. He considered the challenge of China and Russia to be the major threat, since they could pose a viable rival model which could inspire other states.

This view was echoed by Robert Kagan in his 2008 book, &quot;The Return of History and the End of Dreams&quot;, whose title was a deliberate rejoinder to &quot;The End of History&quot;.

In his 2008 &quot;Washington Post&quot; opinion piece, Fukuyama also addressed this point. He wrote, &quot;Despite recent authoritarian advances, liberal democracy remains the strongest, most broadly appealing idea out there. Most autocrats, including Putin and Chávez, still feel that they have to conform to the outward rituals of democracy even as they gut its substance. Even China&#x27;s Hu Jintao felt compelled to talk about democracy in the run-up to Beijing&#x27;s Olympic Games.&quot;

His &quot;ultimate nightmare&quot;, he said in March 2022, is a world in which China supports Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and Russia supports a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. If that were to happen, and be successful, Fukuyama said, &quot;then you would really be living in a world that was being dominated by these non-democratic powers. If the United States and the rest of the West couldn&#x27;t stop that from happening, then that really is the end of the end of history.&quot;

===Failure of civil society and political decay===
In 2014, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the publication of the original essay, &quot;The End of History?&quot;, Fukuyama wrote a column in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; again updating his hypothesis. He wrote that, while liberal democracy still had no real competition from more authoritarian systems of government &quot;in the realm of ideas&quot;, nevertheless he was less idealistic than he had been &quot;during the heady days of 1989&quot;. Fukuyama noted the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and the Arab Spring, both of which seemed to have failed in their pro-democracy goals, as well as the &quot;backsliding&quot; of democracy in countries including Thailand, Turkey and Nicaragua. He stated that the biggest problem for the democratically elected governments in some countries was not ideological but &quot;their failure to provide the substance of what people want from government: personal security, shared economic growth and the basic public services ... that are needed to achieve individual opportunity.&quot; Though he believed that economic growth, improved government and civic institutions all reinforced one another, he wrote that it was not inevitable that &quot;all countries will ... get on that escalator&quot;.

Fukuyama also warned of &quot;political decay&quot;, which he wrote could also affect established democracies like the United States, in which corruption and crony capitalism erode liberty and economic opportunity. Nevertheless, he expressed his continued belief that &quot;the power of the democratic ideal remains immense&quot;.

Following the United Kingdom&#x27;s decision to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2016, Fukuyama feared for the future of liberal democracy in the face of resurgent populism, and the rise of a &quot;post-fact world&quot;, saying that &quot;twenty five years ago, I didn&#x27;t have a sense or a theory about how democracies can go backward. And I think they clearly can.&quot; He warned that America&#x27;s political rot was infecting the world order to the point where it &quot;could be as big as the Soviet collapse&quot;. Fukuyama also highlighted Russia&#x27;s interference in the Brexit referendum and 2016 U.S. elections.

===Posthuman future===

Fukuyama has also stated that his thesis was incomplete, but for a different reason: &quot;there can be no end of history without an end of modern natural science and technology&quot; (quoted from &quot;Our Posthuman Future&quot;). Fukuyama predicts that humanity&#x27;s control of its own evolution will have a great and possibly terrible effect on liberal democracy.

=== Split between democracy and capitalism ===
Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek argues that Fukuyama&#x27;s idea that we have reached the end of history is not wholly true. Žižek points out that liberal democracy is linked to capitalism; however, the success of capitalism in authoritarian nations like China and Singapore shows that the link between capitalism and democracy is broken. Problems caused by the success of capitalism and neo-liberal policies, such as greater wealth inequality and environmental hazards, manifested in many countries with unrest towards elected governments. As a result liberal democracy has struggled to survive many of the problems caused by a free market economy and many nations would see a decline in the quality of their democracy.

<doc id="105891" wikidata="Q19074" url="?curid=105891" title="Samuel P. Huntington">
<text>Samuel Phillips Huntington (April 18, 1927December 24, 2008) was an American political scientist, adviser, and academic. He spent more than half a century at Harvard University, where he was director of Harvard&#x27;s Center for International Affairs and the Albert J. Weatherhead III University Professor.

During the presidency of Jimmy Carter, Huntington was the White House coordinator of security planning for the National Security Council. 

Huntington is known best for his 1993 theory, the &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; otherwise known as COC, of a post–Cold War new world order. He argued that future wars would be fought not between countries, but between cultures, and that Islamic civilization would become the greatest threat to Western domination of the world. Huntington is credited with helping to shape American opinions on civilian-military relations, political development, and comparative government. According to the Open Syllabus Project, Huntington is the second most frequently cited author on college syllabi for political science courses.

==Early life and education==
Huntington was born on April 18, 1927, in New York City, the son of Richard Thomas Huntington, a publisher of hotel trade journals, and Dorothy Sanborn (née Phillips), a short-story writer. His grandfather was publisher John Sanborn Phillips. He graduated with distinction from Yale University at age 18. He served in the U.S. Army from April 1946 to May 1947 and was stationed at Fort Eustis, Virginia. He then earned his master&#x27;s degree from the University of Chicago, and completed his PhD at Harvard University, where he began teaching at age 23.

==Academic career==
Huntington was a member of Harvard&#x27;s department of government from 1950 until he was denied tenure in 1959. Along with Zbigniew Brzezinski, who had also been denied tenure, he moved to Columbia University in New York. From 1959 to 1962 he was an associate professor of government at Columbia, where he was also associate director of their Institute of War and Peace Studies. Huntington was invited to return to Harvard with tenure in 1963 and remained there until his death. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. Huntington and Warren Demian Manshel co-founded and co-edited &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;. Huntington stayed as co-editor until 1977.

Huntington&#x27;s first major book was &quot;The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations&quot; (1957), which was highly controversial when it was published, but at present is regarded as the most influential book on American civil-military relations. He became prominent with his &quot;Political Order in Changing Societies&quot; (1968), a work that challenged the conventional opinion of modernization theorists, that economic and social progress would produce stable democracies in recently decolonized countries. He also was co-author of &quot;The Crisis of Democracy: On the Governability of Democracies&quot;, a report issued by the Trilateral Commission in 1976. In 1977, his friend Brzezinski—who had been appointed national security adviser in the administration of Jimmy Carter—invited Huntington to become White House coordinator of security planning for the National Security Council. He served in this position until the end of 1978.

Huntington served as an instructor at MIT Seminar XXI. He continued to teach undergraduates until his retirement in 2007.

==Personal life==
Huntington met his wife, Nancy Arkelyan, when they were working together on a speech for 1956 presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson. They had two sons, Nicholas and Timothy.

After several years of declining health, Huntington died on December 24, 2008, at age 81 in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.

==Notable arguments==
===&quot;The Soldier and the State&quot;===

In &quot;The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations&quot; (1957), Huntington presents a general theory of civil–military relations. Huntington proposes a theory of objective civilian control, according to which the optimal means of asserting control over the armed forces is to professionalize them.

===&quot;Political Order in Changing Societies&quot;===

In 1968, just as the United States&#x27; war in Vietnam was becoming most intense, Huntington published &quot;Political Order in Changing Societies&quot;, which was a critique of the modernization theory which had affected much US policy regarding the developing world during the prior decade.

Huntington argued that as societies modernize, they become more complex and disordered. If the process of social modernization that produces this disorder is not matched by a process of political and institutional modernization—a process which produces political institutions capable of managing the stress of modernization—the result may be violence.

During the 1970s, Huntington was an advisor to governments, both democratic and dictatorial. During 1972, he met with Medici government representatives in Brazil; a year later he published the report &quot;Approaches to Political Decompression&quot;, warning against the risks of a too-rapid political liberalization, proposing gradual liberalization, and a strong party state modeled upon the image of the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party. After a prolonged transition, Brazil became democratic during 1985.

During the 1980s, he became a valued adviser to the South African regime, which used his ideas on political order to craft its &quot;total strategy&quot; to reform apartheid and suppress growing resistance. He assured South Africa&#x27;s rulers that increasing the repressive power of the state (which at that time included police violence, detention without trial, and torture) can be necessary to effect reform. The reform process, he told his South African audience, often requires &quot;duplicity, deceit, faulty assumptions and purposeful blindness.&quot; He thus gave his imprimatur to his hosts&#x27; project of &quot;reforming&quot; apartheid rather than eliminating it.

Huntington frequently cited Brazil as a success, alluding to his role in his 1988 presidential address to the American Political Science Association, commenting that political science &quot;played a modest role in this process&quot;. Critics, such as British political scientist Alan Hooper, note that contemporary Brazil has an especially unstable party system, wherein the best institutionalized party, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Party, emerged in opposition to controlled transition. Moreover, Hooper claims that the lack of civil participation in contemporary Brazil results from that top-down process of political participation transitions.

===&quot;The Third Wave&quot;===

In his 1991 book &quot;The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century&quot;, Huntington made the argument that beginning with Portugal&#x27;s revolution during 1974, there has been a third wave of democratization which describes a global trend which includes more than 60 countries throughout Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa which have undergone some form of democratic transition. Huntington won the 1992 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for this book.

===&quot;The Clash of Civilizations&quot;===
In 1993, Huntington provoked great debate among international relations theorists with the interrogatively titled &quot;The Clash of Civilizations?&quot;, an influential, oft-cited article published in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine. In the article, he argued that, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Islam would become the biggest obstacle to Western domination of the world. The West&#x27;s next big war therefore, he said, would inevitably be with Islam. Its description of post-Cold War geopolitics and the &quot;inevitability of instability&quot; contrasted with the influential &quot;End of History&quot; thesis advocated by Francis Fukuyama.

Huntington expanded &quot;The Clash of Civilizations?&quot; to book length and published it as &quot;The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order&quot; in 1996. The article and the book posit that post-Cold War conflict would most frequently and violently occur because of cultural rather than ideological differences. That, whilst in the Cold War, conflict occurred between the Capitalist Western Bloc and the Communist Eastern Bloc, it now was most likely to occur between the world&#x27;s major civilizations—identifying eight, and a possible ninth: (i) Western, (ii) Latin American, (iii) Islamic, (iv) Sinic (Chinese), (v) Hindu, (vi) Orthodox, (vii) Japanese, (viii) African, and (ix) Buddhist. This cultural organization contrasts the contemporary world with the classical notion of sovereign states. To understand current and future conflict, cultural rifts must be understood, and culture—rather than the State—must be accepted as the reason for war. Thus, Western nations will lose predominance if they fail to recognize the irreconcilable nature of cultural tensions. Huntington argued that this post-Cold War shift in geopolitical organization and structure requires the West to strengthen itself culturally, by abandoning the imposition of its ideal of democratic universalism and its incessant military interventionism. Underscoring this point, Huntington wrote in the 1996 expansion, &quot;In the emerging world of ethnic conflict and civilizational clash, Western belief in the universality of Western culture suffers three problems: it is false; it is immoral; and it is dangerous.&quot;

The identification of Western Civilization with Western Christianity (Catholic-Protestant) was not Huntington&#x27;s original idea, it was rather the traditional Western opinion and subdivision before the Cold War era. Critics (for example articles in ) call &quot;The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order&quot; the theoretical legitimization of American-caused Western aggression against China and the world&#x27;s Islamic and Orthodox cultures. Other critics argue that Huntington&#x27;s taxonomy is simplistic and arbitrary, and does not take account of the internal dynamics and partisan tensions within civilizations. Furthermore, critics argue that Huntington neglects ideological mobilization by elites and unfulfilled socioeconomic needs of the population as the real causal factors driving conflict, that he ignores conflicts that do not fit well with the civilizational borders identified by him, and that his new paradigm is nothing but realist thinking in which &quot;states&quot; became replaced by &quot;civilizations&quot;. Huntington&#x27;s influence upon US policy has been likened to that of historian Arnold Toynbee&#x27;s controversial religious theories about Asian leaders during the early twentieth century. The &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary on Huntington states that his &quot;emphasis on ancient religious empires, as opposed to states or ethnicities, [as sources of global conflict] gained ... more cachet after the Sept. 11 attacks.&quot;

Huntington wrote that Ukraine might divide along the cultural line between the more Catholic western Ukraine and Orthodox eastern Ukraine:

While a statist approach highlights the possibility of a Russian-Ukrainian war, a civilizational approach minimizes that and instead highlights the possibility of Ukraine splitting in half, a separation which cultural factors would lead one to predict might be more violent than that of Czechoslovakia but far less bloody than that of Yugoslavia.
===&quot;Who Are We&quot; and immigration===

Huntington&#x27;s last book, &quot;Who Are We? The Challenges to America&#x27;s National Identity&quot;, was published in May 2004. Its subject is the meaning of American national identity and what he describes as a cultural threat from large-scale immigration by Latinos, which Huntington says could &quot;divide the United States into two peoples, two cultures, and two languages&quot;. In this book, he called for America to force immigrants to &quot;adopt English&quot; and the US to turn to &quot;Protestant religions&quot; to &quot;save itself against the threats&quot; of Latino and Islamic immigrants. In a book review for the academic journal &quot;Perspectives on Politics&quot;, Gary M. Segura, Dean of the UCLA School of Public Affairs, asserted that the book should not be considered social science because of its divisive views and rhetoric. Segura also called Huntington&#x27;s writing of the book unforgivable on account of Huntington&#x27;s academic position, saying that the work was a polemic rather than a work of scholarship.

===Other===
Huntington is credited with inventing the phrase &quot;Davos Man&quot;, referring to global elites who &quot;have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite&#x27;s global operations&quot;. The phrase refers to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where leaders of the global economy meet.

==National Academy of Sciences controversy==
In 1986, Huntington was nominated for membership to the National Academy of Sciences. The nomination was opposed by Serge Lang, a Yale University mathematician inspired by the writings of mathematician Neal Koblitz, who had accused Huntington of misusing mathematics and engaging in pseudo-science. Lang claimed that Huntington distorted the historical record and used pseudo-mathematics to make his conclusions seem convincing. Lang&#x27;s campaign succeeded; Huntington was twice nominated and twice rejected. A detailed description of these events was published by Lang in &quot;Academia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case&quot; which occupies the first 222 pages of his 1998 book &quot;Challenges&quot;.

Huntington&#x27;s prominence as a Harvard professor and director of Harvard&#x27;s Center for International Affairs led to significant media coverage of his defeated nomination to the NAS, including by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;. His supporters included Herbert A. Simon, a 1978 laureate of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Simon and Koblitz debated in multiple issues of &quot;Mathematical Intelligencer&quot;, with other mathematicians joining in through &quot;Letters to the Editors&quot; column.

<doc id="105892" wikidata="Q887130" url="?curid=105892" title="Samuel Huntington (Connecticut politician)">
<text>Samuel Huntington (July 16, 1731 – January 5, 1796) was a Founding Father of the United States and a lawyer, jurist, statesman, and Patriot in the American Revolution from Connecticut. As a delegate to the Continental Congress, he signed the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation. He also served as President of the Continental Congress from 1779 to 1781, President of the United States in Congress Assembled in 1781, chief justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court from 1784 to 1785, and the 18th Governor of Connecticut from 1786 until his death. He was the first United States governor to have died while in office.

==Early life and education==
Huntington was born to Nathaniel and Mehetabel Huntington on July 16, 1731, in Windham, Connecticut Colony in present-day Scotland, Connecticut, which broke off from Windham in 1857. His house is currently accessible off Route 14. He was the fourth of ten children and the oldest son. He had a limited education in the common schools, then was self-educated. When he was 16, he was apprenticed to a cooper but also continued to help his father on the family farm. His education largely was a product of books he read from the library of Rev. Ebenezer Devotion and books borrowed from local lawyers.

In 1754, Huntington was admitted to the bar, and moved to Norwich, Connecticut, to begin practicing law.

==Career==
===Connecticut Assembly===
After brief service as a selectman, Huntington began his political career in earnest in 1764 when Norwich sent him as one of their representatives to the lower house of the Connecticut Assembly, where he served until 1774. In 1775, he was elected to the upper house, the Governor&#x27;s Council, where he served until 1784. In addition to serving in the legislature, he was appointed king&#x27;s attorney for Connecticut in 1768 and in 1773 was appointed to the colony&#x27;s supreme court, then known as the Supreme Court of Errors. He was chief justice of the Supreme Court from 1784 until 1787.

===American Revolution===
Huntington was an outspoken critic of the Coercive Acts of the British Parliament. In October 1775, the assembly elected him to be one of their delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia.

In January 1776, he joined Roger Sherman and Oliver Wolcott, which collectively represented the Connecticut Colony&#x27;s delegation in the Second Continental Congress. He voted for and signed the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation. He served in the Congress in the years 1776, 1778–1781, and 1783. He suffered from an attack of smallpox while in Congress.

====President of the Continental Congress====
While not known for extensive learning or brilliant speech, Huntington&#x27;s steady hard work and unfailing calm manner earned him the respect of his fellow delegates. As a result, when John Jay left to become minister to the Kingdom of Spain, Huntington was elected to succeed him as President of the Continental Congress on September 28, 1779, which is one reason why he is sometimes considered the first president. The President of Congress was a mostly ceremonial position with no real authority, but the office did require Huntington to handle a good deal of correspondence and sign official documents. He spent his time as president urging the states and their legislatures to support the levies for men, supplies, and money needed to fight the Revolutionary War. The Articles of Confederation were ratified during his term.

Huntington remained as President of Congress until July 9, 1781, when ill health forced him to resign and return to Connecticut. In 1782, Connecticut again named him as a delegate, but his health and judicial duties kept him from accepting. He returned to the Congress as a delegate for the 1783 session to see the success of the revolution embodied in the Treaty of Paris. In that same year, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.

===Governor of Connecticut===
In 1785, Huntington built his mansion house just off the green in Norwichtown, Connecticut at what is now 34 East Town Street and the current headquarters of United and Community Family Services, Inc. In 1785, he was elected as lieutenant governor of Connecticut, serving with Governor Matthew Griswold. In 1786, he became governor. He remained in charge of the Supreme Court during his tenure as lieutenant governor but vacated that position upon election to governor.

In his first year as governor, in a reprise of his efforts in Congress, he brokered the Treaty of Hartford that resolved western land claims between New York and Massachusetts. In 1787, he lent his support to the Northwest Ordinance that completed the national resolution of these issues. In 1788, he presided over the Connecticut Convention that was called to ratify the United States Constitution. In later years he saw the transition of Connecticut into a U.S. state. He resolved the issue of a permanent state capital at Hartford and oversaw the construction of the state house.

He received two electoral votes in the first U.S. presidential election.

He was again a member of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors from 1794 until his death.

==Personal life==
Huntington married Martha Devotion (Rev. Devotion&#x27;s daughter) in 1761. They remained together until her death in 1794. The couple did not birth any children, but when his brother (Rev. Joseph Huntington) died they adopted their nephew and niece. They raised Samuel Huntington &quot;Jr.&quot; and Frances as their own. Samuel Huntington never owned slaves.

==Death==
Huntington died while in office at his home in Norwich on January 5, 1796. His tomb, which was extensively restored in 2003, is located in the Old Norwichtown Cemetery behind his mansion house. Both Samuel and his wife Martha&#x27;s remains were disinterred during the course of the project and then reinterred in a formal ceremony on November 23, 2003.

==Legacy==
Huntington, Connecticut, was named in his honor in 1789 but was later renamed to Shelton when the town incorporated with Shelton to form a city in 1919. He is the namesake of Huntington County, Indiana. Huntington Mills is a small town in northeastern Pennsylvania which also derives its name in honor of Samuel Huntington.

The home that Samuel was born in was built by his father, Nathaniel, around 1732 and still stands. The area is now within the borders of the town of Scotland, Connecticut. In 1994, the home and some grounds were purchased by a local historic trust. The Samuel Huntington Birthplace is a National Historic Landmark.

His nephew and adopted son Samuel H. Huntington moved to the Ohio Country region that he had been instrumental in opening up, and later became the third governor of Ohio.

Because Huntington was the president of the Second Continental Congress when the Articles of Confederation were ratified, some unconventional biographers and civic groups consider Huntington the first President of the United States.

<doc id="105893" wikidata="Q16970117" url="?curid=105893" title="National nature reserve (Scotland)">
<text>The national nature reserves (NNRs) of Scotland are areas of land or water designated under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as containing habitats and species of national importance. National nature reserves can be owned by public, private, community or voluntary organisations but must be managed to conserve their important habitats and species, as well as providing opportunities for the public to enjoy and engage with nature. There are currently 43 NNRs in Scotland, which cover , or less than 1.5% of the land area of Scotland. They range in size from Corrieshalloch Gorge at 7 ha to Mar Lodge Estate, which covers 29,324 ha.

National nature reserve status is an accolade awarded to the best nature reserves in Scotland, and the selected sites provide examples of nationally or internationally important species and habitats. NNRs are intended to showcase Scotland&#x27;s nature, and as well as being well managed for wildlife they must be managed to provide opportunities for the public to visit and enjoy them. NNRs therefore generally have facilities such as visitor centres and trails to allow visitors to explore and understand the habitats or wildlife they contain. 19 of the reserves NNRs have IUCN Category II (national park) status, including, Glen Affric, Rùm, Abernethy Forest and the Great Trossachs Forest. There are no reserves with this status in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. This is mainly due to Scotland&#x27;s natural habitats being more intact than in the rest of the UK. 

Most NNRs in Scotland are also designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Many also form part of the Natura 2000 network, which covers Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation. Additionally, some of the NNRs are designated as Ramsar sites.

==History==
National nature reserves were first created under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. In 1996 the public body responsible for Scotland&#x27;s natural heritage, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH – since renamed NatureScot), undertook a review of NNR policy that took account of the availability of other designations conferring legal protection, such as site of special scientific interest, special protection area and special area of conservation. It was determined that NNR should possess four attributes:
*Primacy of nature – conservation must be the primary land use within a NNR: &quot;nature comes first&quot;.
*National importance – the conservation value of the habitat, species or feature must be such that it is of national importance that the site be managed as a reserve.
*Best practice management – NNRs must be well managed.
*Continuity of management – a long-term view is required.
Additionally, it was determined that NNRs should be managed for at least one of three purposes:
*Raising public awareness.
*Specialised and pro-active management.
*Offering opportunities for research into the ecology and its management.

Between 2000 and 2003 the existing NNRs were reviewed against these criteria. Prior to 2004 there were 73 national nature reserves in Scotland, however a number have since been de-designated. New NNRs have also been designated, such as the National Trust for Scotland&#x27;s Glen Coe and Mar Lodge properties, which were both designated NNRs in 2017.

Since 2012 governance of the NNR designation in Scotland has been through a partnership group, comprising representatives of existing reserve management organisations and community land groups, chaired by NatureScot. NatureScot remains responsible for the statutory declaration of national nature reserves.

==Maintenance and management==
NatureScot is responsible for designating NNRs in Scotland and for overseeing the maintenance and management of each reserve. The majority of NNRs are directly managed by NatureScot; however, some are managed by, or in co-operation with other bodies. The NNR partnership consists of nine bodies:

* Community Land Scotland
* Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS)
* National Trust for Scotland (NTS)
* RSPB Scotland
* Scottish Land and Estates
* NatureScot
* Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT)
* South Lanarkshire Council
* Woodland Trust Scotland

Details on the management of each reserve are shown in the table below.

<doc id="105895" wikidata="Q2298067" url="?curid=105895" title="Solicitor General of the United States">
<text>The solicitor general of the United States (USSG or SG), is the fourth-highest-ranking official within the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), and represents the federal government in cases before the Supreme Court of the United States. The solicitor general is appointed by the president and reports directly to the United States attorney general.

The solicitor general&#x27;s office argues on behalf of the federal government in almost every Supreme Court case in which the United States is a party and also represents in most cases in which the government has filed a brief as &quot;amicus curiae&quot;. In the United States courts of appeals, the solicitor general&#x27;s office reviews cases decided against the United States and determines whether the government will seek review in the Supreme Court. The solicitor general&#x27;s office also reviews cases decided against the United States in the United States district courts and decides whether the government will file an appeal. 

Sarah M. Harris is the acting solicitor general as of January 20, 2025.

==Creation==
The office was created June 22, 1870 by the efforts of Thomas Jenckes, a Representative from Rhode Island, along with Dorman Eaton and William Evarts.

==Composition of the Office of the Solicitor General==
The solicitor general is assisted by four deputy solicitors general and seventeen assistants to the solicitor general. Three of the deputies are career attorneys in the Department of Justice. The remaining deputy is known as the principal deputy, sometimes called the political deputy and, like the solicitor general, typically leaves at the end of an administration.

The solicitor general or one of the deputies typically presents the most important cases in the Supreme Court. Other cases may be argued by one of the assistants or another government attorney. The solicitor general tends to argue six to nine cases per Supreme Court term, while deputies argue four to five cases and assistants argue two to three cases each.

==Significance==
The solicitor general, who has offices in the Supreme Court Building as well as the Department of Justice headquarters, has been called the &quot;tenth justice&quot; as a result of the close relationship between the justices and the solicitor general (and their respective staffs of clerks and deputies). As the most frequent advocate before the Court, the Office of the Solicitor General generally argues dozens of times each term. Furthermore, when the Office of the Solicitor General endorses a petition for &quot;certiorari&quot;, review is frequently granted, which is influential given that only 75 to 125 of the over 7,500 petitions submitted each term are granted review by the Court.

The solicitor general is considered an influential and knowledgeable member of the legal community with regard to Supreme Court litigation. Six solicitors general have later served on the Supreme Court: William Howard Taft (who served as the 27th president of the United States before becoming chief justice of the United States), Stanley Forman Reed, Robert H. Jackson, Thurgood Marshall, and Elena Kagan. Some who have had other positions in the Office of the Solicitor General have also later been appointed to the Supreme Court. For example, Chief Justice John Roberts was the principal deputy solicitor general during the George H. W. Bush administration and Associate Justice Samuel Alito was an assistant to the solicitor general. The last former solicitor general to be successfully nominated to the court was Justice Elena Kagan. Only one former solicitor general has been nominated to the Supreme Court unsuccessfully, that being Robert Bork; however, no sitting solicitor general has ever been denied such an appointment. Eight other solicitors general have served on the United States Courts of Appeals.

Within the Justice Department, the solicitor general exerts significant influence on all appeals brought by the department. The solicitor general is the only U.S. officer who is statutorily required to be &quot;learned in the law&quot;. Whenever the DOJ wins at the trial stage and the losing party appeals, the concerned division of the DOJ responds automatically and proceeds to defend the ruling in the appellate process. However, if the DOJ is the losing party at the trial stage, an appeal can only be brought with the permission of the solicitor general. For example, should the tort division lose a jury trial in federal district court, that ruling cannot be appealed by the Appellate Office without the approval of the solicitor general.

==Call for the views of the solicitor general==
When determining whether to grant &quot;certiorari&quot; in a case where the federal government is not a party, the Court will sometimes request that the solicitor general weigh in, a procedure referred to as a &quot;call for the views of the solicitor general&quot; (CVSG). In response to a CVSG, the solicitor general will file a brief opining on whether the petition should be granted and, usually, which party should prevail.

Although the CVSG is technically an invitation, the solicitor general&#x27;s office treats it as tantamount to a command. Philip Elman, who served as an attorney in the solicitor general&#x27;s office and who was the primary author of the federal government&#x27;s brief in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, wrote, &quot;When the Supreme Court invites you, that&#x27;s the equivalent of a royal command. An invitation from the Supreme Court just can&#x27;t be rejected.&quot;

The Court typically issues a CVSG where the justices believe that the petition is important, and may be considering granting it, but would like a legal opinion before making that decision. Examples include where there is a federal interest involved in the case; where there is a new issue for which there is no established precedent; or where an issue has evolved, perhaps becoming more complex or affecting other issues.

Although there is usually no deadline by which the solicitor general is required to respond to a CVSG, briefs in response to the CVSG are generally filed at three times of the year: late May, allowing the petition to be considered before the Court breaks for summer recess; August, allowing the petition to go on the &quot;summer list&quot;, to be considered at the end of recess; and December, allowing the case to be argued in the remainder of the current Supreme Court term.

The Supreme Court has also occasionally invited a state attorney general to express a view on a petition related to that state. In 2009, for the first time, the invitation was directed instead to a state solicitor general, James Ho of Texas, earning the request the nickname &quot;CVSG-Texas.&quot;

==Traditions==
Several traditions have developed since the Office of Solicitor General was established in 1870. Most obviously to spectators at oral argument before the Court, the solicitor general and his or her deputies traditionally appear in formal morning coats, although Elena Kagan, the first woman to hold the office on other than an acting basis, elected to forgo the practice.

During oral argument, the members of the Court often address the solicitor general as &quot;General.&quot; Some legal commentators such as Michael Herz and Timothy Sandefur have disagreed with this usage, saying that &quot;general&quot; is a postpositive adjective (which modifies the noun &quot;solicitor&quot;), and is not a title itself.

Another tradition is the practice of confession of error. If the government prevailed in the lower court but the solicitor general disagrees with the result, the solicitor general may confess error, after which the Supreme Court will vacate the lower court&#x27;s ruling and send the case back for reconsideration.

==List of solicitors general==
:Note: Some terms overlap because the incumbent remained in office after a successor was named. The office has been vacant at times while awaiting the nomination or confirmation of a successor.
