<text>Owensboro is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of Daviess County, Kentucky, United States. It is the fourth-most populous city in the state. Owensboro is located on U.S. Route 60 and Interstate 165 about southwest of Louisville, and is the principal city of the Owensboro metropolitan area. The 2020 census had its population at 60,183. The metropolitan population was estimated at 116,506. The metropolitan area is the sixth largest in the state as of 2018, and the seventh largest population center in the state when including micropolitan areas.

==History==
Evidence of Native American settlement in the area dates back 12,000 years. Following a series of failed uprisings with British support, however, the last Shawnee were forced to vacate the area before the end of the 18th century.

The first European descendant to settle in Owensboro was frontiersman William Smeathers or Smothers in 1797, for whom the riverfront park is named. The settlement was originally known as &quot;Yellow Banks&quot; from the color of the land beside the Ohio River. In 1817, Yellow Banks was formally established under the name Owensborough, named after Col. Abraham Owen. In 1893, the spelling of the name was shortened to its current Owensboro.

Several distillers, mainly of bourbon whiskey, have been in and around the city of Owensboro. The major distillery still in operation is the Glenmore Distillery Company, now owned by the Sazerac Company. The other distillery, Green River Distilling Company, started in 1885 and is also Owensboro based. It is still in operation today.

On August 14, 1936, downtown Owensboro was the site of the last public hanging in the United States. A 26 year old African American man, Rainey Bethea, was convicted and sentenced for the rape and murder of 70-year-old Lischa Edwards in a very short time (only 37 days lapsed between the crime and the execution). A carnival atmosphere was in place with vendors selling hotdogs, attended by a large crowd including children and many reporters. The execution was presided over by a female sheriff, Florence Shoemaker Thompson, who gained national media attention for her role in the process, although she declined to spring the trap. Before Bethea was dead, the crowd had already begun to tear at his clothes and even his body for souvenirs. The Kentucky General Assembly quickly abolished public executions after the embarrassment this caused.

===Manufacturing===
As of 1903, Owensboro was home to several stemmeries.
Pinkerton Tobacco produced Red Man (now America&#x27;s Best Chew) chewing tobacco in Owensboro. Swedish Match continues to make America&#x27;s Best Chew in a plant outside city limits.

The Owensboro Wagon Company, established in 1884, was one of the largest and most influential wagon companies in the nation. With eight styles or sizes of wagons, the company set the standard of quality at the turn of the 20th century.

Frederick A. Ames came to Owensboro from Washington, Pennsylvania, in 1887. He started the Carriage Woodstock Company to repair horse-drawn carriages. In 1910, he began to manufacture a line of automobiles under the Ames brand name. Ames hired industrialist Vincent Bendix in 1912, and the company became the Ames Motor Car Company. Despite its product being called the &quot;best $1500&quot; car by a Texas car dealer, the company ceased production of its own model in 1915. The company then began manufacturing replacement bodies for the more widely sold Ford Model T. In 1922, the company remade itself and started to manufacture furniture under the name Ames Corporation. The company finally sold out to Whitehall Furniture in 1970.

The start of the Kentucky Electrical Lamp Company, a light bulb manufacturing company was in 1899; it eventually was acquired by Kentucky Radio Company (Ken-Rad) in 1918 and later acquired by General Electric in 1945 and in 1987 acquired by MPD, Inc., created the light bulbs that illuminated the first night game in the history of Major League Baseball on May 24, 1935, between the Reds and Phillies at Cincinnati&#x27;s Crosley Field. The Owensboro plant was a major part of General Electric&#x27;s vacuum tube manufacturing operations, producing both receiving types and military/industrial ceramic types. In 1961, engineers at the General Electric plant in Owensboro introduced a family of vacuum tubes called the Compactron.

In June 1932, John G. Barnard founded the Modern Welding Company in a small building located near the Ohio River at First and Frederica Streets where the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and Museum sits today. Today, Modern Welding Company has nine steel tank and vessel fabrication subsidiaries located throughout the United States, and five welding supply stores located in Kentucky and Indiana. The company is the country&#x27;s largest supplier of underground and above ground steel storage tanks for flammable and combustible liquids. The company celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2007.

Texas Gas Transmission Corporation was created in 1948 with the merger of Memphis Natural Gas Company and Kentucky Natural Gas Corporation and made its headquarters in Owensboro. Since that time, Texas Gas changed ownership four times. The company was bought by CSX Corp. in 1983, by Transco Energy Corp. in 1989, by Williams in 1995, and by Loews Corporation in 2003.

<doc id="101249" wikidata="Q435920" url="?curid=101249" title="Rod Serling">
<text>Rodman Edward Serling (December 25, 1924 – June 28, 1975) was an American screenwriter and television producer best known for his live television dramas of the 1950s and his anthology television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Serling was active in politics, both on and off the screen, and helped form television industry standards. He was known as the &quot;angry young man&quot; of Hollywood, clashing with television executives and sponsors over a wide range of issues, including censorship, racism, and war.

==Early life==
Serling was born on December 25, 1924, in Syracuse, New York, to a Jewish family. He was the second of two sons born to Esther (née Cooper, 1893–1958), a homemaker, and Samuel Lawrence Serling (1892–1945). Serling&#x27;s father had worked as a secretary and amateur inventor before his children were born but took on his father-in-law&#x27;s profession as a grocer to earn a steady income. Sam Serling later became a butcher after the Great Depression forced the store to close. Rod had an older brother, novelist and aviation writer Robert J. Serling.

Serling spent most of his youth south of Syracuse in Binghamton, New York, after his family moved there in 1926. His parents encouraged his talents as a performer. Sam Serling built a small stage in the basement, where Rod often put on plays (with or without neighborhood children). His older brother, writer Robert, recalled that, at the age of six or seven, Rod entertained himself for hours by acting out dialogue from pulp magazines or movies he had seen. Rod would often ask questions without waiting for their answers. On an hour trip from Binghamton to Syracuse, the rest of the family remained silent to see if Rod would notice their lack of participation. He did not, and he talked nonstop through the entire car ride.

In elementary school, Serling was seen as the class clown and dismissed by many of his teachers as a lost cause. His seventh-grade English teacher, Helen Foley, encouraged him to enter the school&#x27;s public speaking extracurriculars. He joined the debate team and was a speaker at his high school graduation. He began writing for the school newspaper, in which, according to the journalist Gordon Sander, he &quot;established a reputation as a social activist&quot;.

Serling was interested in sports, and excelled at tennis and table tennis. When he attempted to join the varsity football team, he was told he was too small at tall.

Serling was interested in radio and writing at an early age. He was an avid radio listener, especially interested in thrillers, fantasy, and horror shows. Arch Oboler and Norman Corwin were two of his favorite writers. He also &quot;did some staff work at a Binghamton radio station ... tried to write ... but never had anything published.&quot; He was accepted into college during his senior year of high school. However, the United States was involved in World War II at the time, and Serling decided to enlist rather than start college immediately after he graduated from Binghamton Central High School in 1943.

As editor of his high school newspaper, Serling encouraged his fellow students to support the war effort. He wanted to leave school before graduation to join the fight, but his civics teacher talked him into waiting for graduation. &quot;War is a temporary thing,&quot; Gus Youngstrom told him. &quot;It ends. Education doesn&#x27;t. Without your degree, where will you be after the war?&quot;

==American military service==
Serling enlisted in the U.S. Army the morning after high school graduation, following his brother Robert.

Serling began his military career in 1943 at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, under General Joseph May Swing and Colonel Orin D. Haugen and served in the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 11th Airborne Division. He eventually reached the rank of Technician Fourth Grade (T/4).

Over the next year of paratrooper training, Serling and others began boxing to vent aggression. He competed as a flyweight and had 17 bouts, rising to the second round of the division finals before being knocked out. He was remembered for his Berserker style, and for &quot;getting his nose broken in his first bout and again in the last bout&quot;. He tried his hand at the Golden Gloves, with little success.

On April 25, 1944, Serling received his orders and saw that he was being sent west to California. He knew that he would be fighting against the Empire of Japan rather than Nazi Germany. This disappointed him because he had hoped to help fight against Adolf Hitler. In May, he was assigned to the Pacific Theater in New Guinea and the Philippine islands.
In November 1944, his division first saw combat, landing in the Philippines. The 11th Airborne Division was not used as paratroopers, however, but as light infantry during the Battle of Leyte. The division helped secure the area after the five divisions that had gone ashore earlier.

For a variety of reasons, Serling was transferred to the 511th&#x27;s demolition platoon, nicknamed &quot;The Death Squad&quot; for its high casualty rate. According to Sergeant Frank Lewis, leader of the demolitions squad, &quot;He screwed up somewhere along the line. Apparently he got on someone&#x27;s nerves.&quot; Lewis also judged that Serling was not suited to be a field soldier: &quot;he didn&#x27;t have the wits or aggressiveness required for combat.&quot; At one point, Lewis, Serling, and others were in a firefight, trapped in a foxhole. As they waited for darkness, Lewis noticed that Serling had not reloaded any of his extra magazines. Serling sometimes went exploring on his own, against orders, and got lost.

Serling&#x27;s time in Leyte shaped his writing and political views for the rest of his life. He saw death every day while in the Philippines, at the hands of his enemies and his allies, and through freak accidents such as that which killed another Jewish private, Melvin Levy. Levy was delivering a comic monologue for the platoon as they rested under a palm tree when a food crate was dropped from a plane above, decapitating him. Serling led the funeral services for Levy and placed a Star of David over his grave. Serling later set several of his scripts in the Philippines and used the unpredictability of death as a theme in much of his writing. In the 1960 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Purple Testament&quot;, a prologue written by Serling stated, &quot;Infantry platoon, U.S. Army, Philippine Islands, 1945. These are the faces of the young men who fight, as if some omniscient painter had mixed a tube of oils that were at one time earth brown, dust gray, blood red, beard black, and fear—yellow white, and these men were the models. For this is the province of combat, and these are the faces of war.&quot;

Serling returned from the successful mission in Leyte with two wounds, including one to his kneecap, but neither kept him from combat when General Douglas MacArthur deployed the paratroopers for their usual purpose on February 3, 1945. Colonel Haugen led the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment as it landed on Tagaytay Ridge, met the 188th Glider Infantry Regiment and marched into Manila. It met minimal resistance until it reached the city, where Vice Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi had arranged his 17,000 troops behind a maze of traps and guns and ordered them to fight to the death. During the next month, Serling&#x27;s unit battled block by block for control of Manila.

When portions of the city were taken from Japanese control, local civilians sometimes showed their gratitude by throwing parties and hosting banquets. During one of these parties, Serling and his comrades were fired upon, resulting in many soldier and civilian deaths. Serling, still a private after three years, caught the attention of Sergeant Lewis when he ran into the line of fire to rescue a performer who had been on stage when the artillery started firing.

As it moved in on Iwabuchi&#x27;s stronghold, Serling&#x27;s regiment had a 50% casualty rate, with over 400 men killed or wounded. Serling was wounded and three comrades were killed by shrapnel from rounds fired at his roving demolition team by an antiaircraft gun. He was sent to New Guinea to recover but soon returned to Manila to finish &quot;cleaning up&quot;.

Serling&#x27;s final assignment was as part of the occupation force in Japan. During his military service, Private Serling was awarded the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Philippine Liberation Medal.

Serling&#x27;s combat experience affected him deeply and influenced much of his writing. It left him with nightmares and flashbacks for the rest of his life. He said, &quot;I was bitter about everything and at loose ends when I got out of the service. I think I turned to writing to get it off my chest.&quot;

===Awards===

==Postwar life, education, and family==
After being discharged from the Army in 1946, Serling worked at a rehabilitation hospital while recovering from his wounds. His knee troubled him for years. Later, his wife, Carol, became accustomed to the sound of him falling on the stairs when his knee would buckle.

When he was fit enough, he used the federal G.I. bill&#x27;s educational benefits and disability payments to enroll in the physical education program at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. He had been accepted to Antioch (his brother&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;) while in high school. His interests led him to the theater department and then to broadcasting. He changed his major to Literature and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1950. &quot;I was kind of mixed up and restless, and I kind of liked their work-for-a-term, go-to-school-for-a-term set-up,&quot; he recounted.
As part of his studies, Serling became active in the campus radio station, an experience that proved useful in his future career. He wrote, directed, and acted in many radio programs on campus, then around the state, as part of his work study. Here he met Carolyn Louise &quot;Carol&quot; Kramer, a fellow student, who later became his wife. At first, she refused to date him because of his promiscuous campus reputation, but she eventually changed her mind. He joined the Unitarian church in college, which allowed him to marry Kramer on July 31, 1948. They had two daughters, Jodi (born 1952) and Anne (born 1955).

Carol Serling&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Louise Taft Orton Caldwell, had a summer home on Cayuga Lake in Interlaken, New York, which was the honeymoon destination for the newlyweds. The Serling family continued to use this house annually throughout Rod&#x27;s life, missing only two summers in the years when his daughters were born.

For extra money in his college years, Serling worked part-time testing parachutes for the United States Army Air Forces. According to his radio station coworkers, he received $50 for each successful jump and had once been paid $500 (half before and half if he survived) for a hazardous test. His last test jump was a few weeks before his wedding. In one instance, he earned $1,000 for testing a jet ejection seat that had killed the previous three testers.

==Career==

===Radio===
Serling volunteered at WNYC in New York as an actor and writer in the summer of 1946. The next year, he worked at that station as a paid intern in his Antioch work-study program. He then took odd jobs in other radio stations in New York and Ohio. &quot;I learned &#x27;time&#x27;, writing for a medium that is measured in seconds,&quot; Serling later said of his early experiences.

While attending college, Serling worked at the Antioch Broadcasting System&#x27;s radio workshop and was managing the station within a couple of years. He then took charge of full-scale radio productions at Antioch which were broadcast on WJEM, in Springfield. He wrote and directed the programs and acted in them when needed. He created the entire output for the 1948–1949 school year. With one exception (an adaptation), all the writing that year was his original work.

While in college, Serling won his first accolade as a writer. The radio program, &quot;Dr. Christian&quot;, had started an annual scriptwriting contest eight years earlier. Thousands of scripts were sent in annually, but very few could be produced. Serling won a trip to New York City and $500 for his radio script &quot;To Live a Dream&quot;. He and his new wife, Carol, attended the awards broadcast on May 18, 1949, where he and the other winners were interviewed by the star of &quot;Dr. Christian&quot;, Jean Hersholt. One of the other winners that day was Earl Hamner, Jr., who had also earned prizes in previous years. 
Serling&#x27;s first job out of college was with WLW radio as copy writer. The position had just been vacated by Hamner who left to concentrate on his writing.
Hamner later wrote scripts for Serling&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

In addition to earning $45 to $50 a week at the college radio station, Serling attempted to make a living selling freelance scripts of radio programs, but the industry at that time was involved in many lawsuits, which affected willingness to take on new writers (some whose scripts were rejected would often hear a similar plot produced, claim their work had been stolen, and sue for recompense). Serling was rejected for reasons such as &quot;heavy competition&quot;, &quot;this script lacks professional quality&quot;, and &quot;not what our audience prefers to listen to&quot;.

In the autumn of 1949, Martin Horrell of &quot;Grand Central Station&quot; (a radio program known for romances and light dramas) rejected one of Serling&#x27;s scripts about boxing, because his mostly female listeners &quot;have told us in no uncertain terms that prize fight stories aren&#x27;t what they like most&quot;. Horrell advised that &quot;the script would be far better for sight than for sound only, because in any radio presentation, the fights are not seen. Perhaps this is a baby you should try on some of the producers of television shows.&quot;

Realizing the boxing story was not right for &quot;Grand Central Station&quot;, Serling submitted a lighter piece called &quot;Hop Off the Express and Grab a Local&quot;, which became his first nationally broadcast piece on September 10, 1949. His &quot;Dr. Christian&quot; script aired on November 30 of that year.

Serling began his professional writing career in 1950, when he earned $75 a week as a network continuity writer for WLW radio in Cincinnati, Ohio. While at WLW, he continued to freelance. He sold several radio and television scripts to WLW&#x27;s parent company, Crosley Broadcasting Corporation. After selling the scripts, Serling had no further involvement with them. They were sold by Crosley to local stations across the United States.

Serling submitted an idea for a weekly radio show in which the ghosts of a young boy and girl killed in World War II would look through train windows and comment on day-to-day human life as it moved around the country. This idea was changed significantly but was produced from October 1950 to February 1951 as &quot;Adventure Express&quot;, a drama about a girl and boy who travel by train with their uncle. Each week they found adventure in a new town and got involved with the local residents.

Other radio programs for which Serling wrote scripts include &quot;Leave It to Kathy&quot;, &quot;Our America&quot;, and &quot;Builders of Destiny&quot;. During the production of these, he became acquainted with a voice actor, Jay Overholts, who later became a regular on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

Serling said of his time as a staff writer for radio: 

Serling believed radio was not living up to its potential, later saying, &quot;Radio, in terms of ... drama, dug its own grave. It had aimed downward, had become cheap and unbelievable, and had willingly settled for second best.&quot; He opined that there were very few radio writers who would be remembered for their literary contributions.

===Television===
Serling moved from radio to television, as a writer for WKRC-TV in Cincinnati. His duties included writing testimonial advertisements for dubious medical remedies and scripts for a comedy duo. He continued at WKRC after graduation and, amidst the mostly dreary day-to-day work, also created a series of scripts for a live television program, &quot;The Storm&quot;, as well as for other anthology dramas (a format which was in demand by networks based in New York). Following a full day of classes (or, in later years, work), he spent evenings on his own, writing. He sent manuscripts to publishers and received forty rejection slips during these early years.

In 1950, Serling hired Blanche Gaines as an agent. His radio scripts received more rejections, so he began rewriting them for television. Whenever a script was rejected by one program, he would resubmit it to another, eventually finding a home for many in either radio or television.

As Serling&#x27;s college years ended, his scripts began to sell. He continued to write for television and eventually left WKRC to become a full-time freelance writer. He recalled, &quot;Writing is a demanding profession and a selfish one. And because it is selfish and demanding, because it is compulsive and exacting, I didn&#x27;t embrace it. I succumbed to it.&quot;

According to his wife, Serling &quot;just up and quit one day, during the winter of 1952, about six months before our first daughter Jody was born—though he was also doing some freelancing and working on a weekly dramatic show for another Cincinnati station.&quot; He and his family moved to Connecticut in early 1953. Here he made a living by writing for the live dramatic anthology shows that were prevalent at the time, including &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Appointment with Adventure&quot; and &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;. By the end of 1954, his agent convinced him he needed to move to New York, &quot;where the action is.&quot;

The writer Marc Scott Zicree, who spent years researching his book &quot;The Twilight Zone Companion&quot;, noted, &quot;Sometimes the situations were clichéd, the characters two-dimensional, but always there was at least some search for an emotional truth, some attempt to make a statement on the human condition.&quot;

====Gaining fame====
In 1955, the nationwide &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; televised a program based on Serling&#x27;s 72nd script. To Serling, it was just another script, and he missed the first live broadcast. He and his wife hired a babysitter for the night and told her, &quot;no one would call because we had just moved to town. And the phone just started ringing and didn&#x27;t stop for years!&quot; The title of this episode was &quot;Patterns&quot;, and it soon changed his life.
&quot;Patterns&quot; dramatized the power struggle between a veteran corporate boss running out of ideas and energy and the bright, young executive being groomed to take his place. Instead of firing the loyal employee and risk tarnishing his own reputation, the boss enlists him into a campaign to push aside his competition. Serling modeled the character of the boss on his former commander, Colonel Orin Haugen.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Jack Gould called the show &quot;one of the high points in the TV medium&#x27;s evolution&quot; and said, &quot;[f]or sheer power of narrative, forcefulness of characterization and brilliant climax, Mr. Serling&#x27;s work is a creative triumph.&quot; Robert Lewis Shayon stated in &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;in the years I have been watching television I do not recall being so engaged by a drama, nor so stimulated to challenge the haunting conclusions of an hour&#x27;s entertainment.&quot; The episode was a hit with the audience as well, and a second live show was staged by popular demand one month later. During the time between the two shows, Kraft executives negotiated with people from Hollywood over the rights to &quot;Patterns&quot;. Kraft said they were considering rebroadcasting &quot;Patterns&quot;, unless the play or motion picture rights were sold first.

Immediately following the original broadcast of &quot;Patterns&quot;, Serling was inundated with offers of permanent jobs, congratulations, and requests for novels, plays, and television or radio scripts. He quickly sold many of his earlier, lower-quality works and watched in dismay as they were published. Critics expressed concern that he was not living up to his promise and began to doubt he was able to recreate the quality of writing that &quot;Patterns&quot; had shown.

Serling then wrote &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot; for the television series &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; in 1956, again gaining praise from critics.

In the autumn of 1957, the Serling family moved to California. When television was new, shows aired live from New York, but as studios began to tape their shows, the business moved from the East Coast to the West Coast. The Serlings would live in California for much of his life, but they kept property in Binghamton and Cayuga Lake as retreats for when he needed time alone.

====Corporate censorship====
The early years of television often saw sponsors working as editors and censors. Serling was often forced to change his scripts after corporate sponsors read them and found something they felt was too controversial. They were wary of anything they thought might make them look bad to consumers, so references to many contemporary social issues were omitted, as were references to anything that might compete commercially with a sponsor. For instance, the line &quot;Got a match?&quot; was deleted because one of the sponsors of &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot; was Ronson lighters.
The initial story-line of his teleplay &quot;Noon on Doomsday&quot; (aired April 25, 1956) was set in the Southern United States about the lynching of a Jewish pawnbroker. However, when Serling mentioned in a radio interview that it was inspired by the events and racism that led to the murder of Emmett Till, censorship by advertisers and the TV network resulted in significant changes. The program as shown was set in New England and concerned the killing of an unknown foreigner. He subsequently returned to the Till events when writing &quot;A Town Has Turned to Dust&quot; for &#x27;Playhouse 90&#x27; but had to set it a century in the past and remove any inter-racial dynamics before it would be produced by CBS TV.

Gould, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer, added this editorial note at the end of a glowing review for &quot;A Town Has Turned to Dust&quot;, a show about racism and bigotry in a small Southwestern town: &quot;&#x27;Playhouse 90&#x27; and Mr. Serling had to fight executive interference ... before getting their play on the air last night. The theater people of Hollywood have reason to be proud of their stand in the viewers&#x27; behalf.&quot;

Frustrated by seeing his scripts divested of political statements and ethnic identities (and having a reference to the Chrysler Building removed from a script sponsored by Ford), Serling decided the only way to avoid such artistic interference was to create his own show. In an interview with Mike Wallace, he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to fight anymore. I don&#x27;t want to have to battle sponsors and agencies. I don&#x27;t want to have to push for something that I want and have to settle for second best. I don&#x27;t want to have to compromise all the time, which in essence is what a television writer does if he wants to put on controversial themes.&quot;

Serling submitted &quot;The Time Element&quot; to CBS, intending it to be a pilot for his new weekly show, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Instead, CBS used the science fiction script for a new show produced by Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse,&quot; in 1958. The story concerns a man who has vivid nightmares of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The man goes to a psychiatrist and, after the session, the twist ending (a device which Serling became known for) reveals the &quot;patient&quot; had died at Pearl Harbor, and the &quot;psychiatrist&quot; was the one actually having the vivid dreams. The episode received so much positive fan response that CBS agreed to let Serling go ahead with his pilot for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

====&quot;The Storm&quot;====
Before &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, Serling created a local television show in Cincinnati on WKRC-TV, &quot;The Storm&quot;, in the early 1950s. Several of these scripts were rewritten for later use on national network TV. A copy of an episode is located in the Cincinnati Museum Center Historical Cincinnati Library on videotape.

====&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;====

On October 2, 1959, the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; series, created by Serling, premiered on CBS.

For this series, Serling fought hard to get and maintain creative control. He hired scriptwriters he respected, such as Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont. In an interview, Serling said the show&#x27;s science fiction format would not be controversial with sponsors, network executives, or the general public and would escape censorship, unlike the earlier script for &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

Serling drew on his own experience for many episodes, frequently about boxing, military life, and airplane pilots. &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; incorporated his social views on racial relations, somewhat veiled in the science fiction and fantasy elements of the shows. Occasionally, the point was quite blunt, such as in the episode &quot;I Am the Night—Color Me Black&quot;, in which hatred caused a dark cloud to form in a small town in the American Midwest and spread across the world. Many &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; stories reflected his views on gender roles, featuring quick-thinking, resilient women as well as shrewish, nagging wives.

&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; aired for five seasons (the first three presented half-hour episodes, the fourth had hour-long episodes, and the fifth returned to the half-hour format). It won many television and drama awards and drew critical acclaim for Serling and his co-workers. Although it had loyal fans, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; had only moderate ratings and was twice canceled and revived. After five years and 156 episodes (92 written by Serling), he grew weary of the series. In 1964, he decided not to oppose its third and final cancellation.

Serling sold the rights to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; to CBS. His wife later claimed he did this partly because he believed that his own production company, Cayuga Productions, would never recoup the production costs of the programs, which frequently went over budget.

&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; eventually resurfaced in the form of a 1983 film by Warner Bros. Former &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; actor Burgess Meredith was cast as the film&#x27;s narrator, but does not appear on screen. There have been three attempts to revive the television series with mostly new scripts. In 1985, CBS used Charles Aidman (and later Robin Ward) as the narrator. In 2002, UPN featured Forest Whitaker in the role of narrator. In 2019, CBS made a third attempt at a successful revival, with Jordan Peele taking on producing duties as well as being host and narrator.

====&quot;A Carol for Another Christmas&quot;====
&quot;A Carol for Another Christmas&quot; was a 1964 American television movie, scripted by Rod Serling as a modernization of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and a plea for global cooperation between nations. It was telecast only once, on December 28, 1964. The only television movie directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this was the film in which Peter Sellers gave his first performance after a series of near-fatal heart attacks in the wake of his marriage to Britt Ekland. Sellers portrayed a demagogue in an apocalyptic Christmas.

====&quot;Night Gallery&quot;====
In 1969, NBC aired a television film pilot for a new series, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, written by Serling. Set in a dimly lit museum after hours, the pilot film featured Serling (as on-camera host) playing the curator, who introduced three tales of the macabre, unveiling canvases that would appear in the subsequent story segments. Its brief first season (consisting of only six episodes) was rotated with three other shows airing in the same time slot; this wheel show was entitled &quot;Four in One&quot;. The series generally focused more on horror and suspense than &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; did. On the insistence of the producer Jack Laird, &quot;Night Gallery&quot; also began including brief comedic &quot;blackout&quot; sketches during its second season, which Serling greatly disdained. He stated &quot;I thought they [the blackout sketches] distorted the thread of what we were trying to do on &quot;Night Gallery&quot;. I don&#x27;t think one can show Edgar Allan Poe and then come back with Flip Wilson for 34 seconds. I just don&#x27;t think they fit.&quot;

No longer wanting the burden of an executive position, Serling sidestepped an offer to retain creative control of content, a decision he would come to regret. Although discontented with some of the scripts and creative choices of Jack Laird, Serling continued to submit his work and ultimately wrote over a third of the series&#x27; scripts. By season three, however, many of his contributions were being rejected or heavily altered. &quot;Night Gallery&quot; was cancelled in 1973. NBC later combined episodes of the short-lived paranormal series &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; with &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, in order to increase the number of episodes available in syndication. Serling was reportedly paid $100,000 to film introductions for these repackaged episodes.

====Other television====

After &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; was canceled, Serling wrote an unsuccessful western television series called &quot;The Loner,&quot; which ran from the fall of 1965 to April 1966. CBS asked Serling to have more action and less character interaction. He refused to comply, even though the show had received poor reviews and low ratings.

In a stylistic departure from his earlier work, Serling briefly hosted the first version of the game show &quot;Liar&#x27;s Club&quot; in 1969.

In the 1970s, Serling appeared in television commercials for Ford, Radio Shack, Ziebart and the Japanese automaker Mazda. He also made occasional acting appearances, all in material he didn&#x27;t write. Serling appears as a version of himself (but named &quot;Mr. Zone&quot;) in a comedic bit on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;; he appears in a 1962 episode of the short-lived sitcom &quot;Ichabod and Me&quot; in the role of reclusive counterculture novelist Eugene Hollinfield; and in a 1972 episode of the crime drama &quot;Ironside&quot; entitled &quot;Bubble, Bubble, Toil, and Murder&quot; (which also featured a young Jodie Foster), in which he plays a small role as the proprietor of an occult magic shop.

===Other radio===

====&quot;The Zero Hour&quot;====
Serling returned to radio late in his career with &quot;The Zero Hour&quot; (also known as &quot;Hollywood Radio Theater&quot;) in 1973. The drama anthology series featured tales of mystery, adventure, and suspense, airing in stereo for two seasons. Serling hosted the program but did not write any of the scripts. The series ended on July 26, 1974.

====&quot;Fantasy Park&quot;====
Serling&#x27;s final radio performance was even more unusual: &quot;Fantasy Park&quot; was a 48-hour-long rock concert aired by nearly 200 stations in 1974 and 1975. The program, written and produced by McLendon National Productions Director Steve Blackson, featured performances by dozens of rock stars of the day, and even reunited the Beatles. It was also completely &quot;imaginary&quot;—as KNUS Program Director Beau Weaver put it, a &quot;theatre-of-the-mind for the &#x27;70s&quot;. The concert used record albums, many recorded live in concert, plus crowd noise, interviews, schedule updates by host Fred Kennedy, and other sound effects. (Stations that aired the special were reportedly inundated by callers demanding to know how to get to the nonexistent concert.) KNUS general manager Bart McLendon recruited Serling to record the host segments, bumpers, custom promos, and television spots.

Serling wrote the disclaimers, which aired each hour: &quot;Hello, this is Rod Serling and welcome back to &quot;Fantasy Park&quot;—the crowds here today are unreal.&quot; &quot;This is &quot;Fantasy Park&quot;—the greatest live concert—&quot;never&quot; held.&quot;

===Teaching===
Serling kept his schedule full. When he was not writing, promoting, or producing his work, he often spoke on college campuses around the country. He taught week-long seminars in which students would watch and critique films. In the political climate of the 1960s, he often felt a stronger connection to the older students in his evening classes. Serling&#x27;s critique of high school student writing was a pivotal experience for writer J. Michael Straczynski.

By the fourth season of &quot;Twilight Zone,&quot; Serling was exhausted and turned much of the writing over to a trusted stable of screenwriters, authoring only seven episodes. Desiring to take a break and clear his mind, he took a one-year teaching job as writer in residence at Antioch College, Ohio. He taught classes in the 1962–63 school year on writing and drama and a survey course covering the &quot;social and historical implications of the media.&quot; He used this time to teach as well as work on a new screenplay, &quot;Seven Days in May&quot;.

Later he taught at Ithaca College, from the late 1960s until his death in 1975. He was one of the first guest teachers at the Sherwood Oaks Experimental College in Hollywood, California. Audio recordings of his lectures there are included as bonus features on some &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; home video editions.

==Themes==
According to his wife, Carol, Serling often said that &quot;the ultimate obscenity is not caring, not doing something about what you feel, not feeling! Just drawing back and drawing in, becoming narcissistic.&quot; This philosophy can be seen in his writing. Some themes appear again and again in his writing, many of which are concerned with war and politics. Another common theme is equality among all people.

===Antiwar activism===
Serling&#x27;s experiences as a soldier left him with strong opinions about the use of military force. He was an outspoken antiwar activist, especially during the Vietnam War. He supported antiwar politicians, notably U.S. senator Eugene McCarthy in his presidential campaign in 1968.

&quot;The Rack&quot; is an example of Serling&#x27;s use of television to speak his mind on political issues. This script for &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot; tells the story of an army captain charged with collaborating with the North Koreans. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer J. P. Shanley called it &quot;controversial and compelling&quot;. Serling tackled a question that was much in the media at the time: should veterans be charged with a crime if they cooperated with the enemy while under duress? In this courtroom drama, the accused is put on trial for helping the enemy by urging fellow prisoners of war to cooperate with their captors. Serling offers many valid arguments on behalf of both the defense and the prosecution. Each has a strong case, but in the end, the captain is found guilty. There is no Serling narration to conclude the drama, as he had become famous for in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;—instead, the audience is left to make their own conclusions after the verdict has been rendered.

&quot;No Christmas This Year&quot; was a script written early in Serling&#x27;s career, around 1950, but was never produced. It told of a place that no longer celebrated Christmas, although none of the residents know why it has been canceled. Meanwhile, at the North Pole, the audience sees Santa Claus dealing with striking elves. Rather than creating toys and candy, the North Pole manufactures a diversity of bombs and offensive gases. Santa has been shot at on his route, and an elf was hit by shrapnel.

&quot;24 Men to a Plane&quot; recounts Serling&#x27;s first combat jump into the area around Manila in 1945. The combat jump became a fiasco after the jumpmaster in the first plane dropped his men too early, causing every subsequent plane to drop in synchronization with the mistake.

===Racial equality===
&quot;A Town Has Turned to Dust&quot; received a positive review from the critic Jack Gould, who was known for being straightforward to the point of being harsh in his reviews. He called &quot;A Town Has Turned to Dust&quot; &quot;a raw, tough and at the same time deeply moving outcry against prejudice.&quot; Set in a Southwestern town in a deep drought, it sees poverty and despair turn racial tensions deadly when the ineffectual sheriff is unable to stand against the town. A young Mexican boy is lynched, and the town as a whole is to blame. A second lynching is in the works after a series of events leads again to the town turning against the Mexicans. This time, the sheriff stands strong, and the first boy&#x27;s brother is saved, even as the town is not. &quot;Mr. Serling incorporated his protest against prejudice in vivid dialogue and sound situations. He made his point that hate for a fellow being leads only to the ultimate destruction of the bigoted.&quot;

Serling took his 1972 screenplay for the film &quot;The Man&quot; from the Irving Wallace novel of the same title. The black senator from New Hampshire and president &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the Senate, played by James Earl Jones, assumes the U.S. presidency by succession.

==Death==

Serling was said to smoke three to four packs of cigarettes a day. On May 3, 1975, he had a heart attack and was hospitalized. He spent two weeks at Tompkins County Community Hospital before being released. A second heart attack two weeks later forced doctors to agree that open-heart surgery, although considered risky at the time, was required. The ten-hour-long procedure was performed on June 26, but Serling had a third heart attack on the operating table and died two days later at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York. He was 50 years old.

His funeral and burial took place on July 2 at Lake View Cemetery, Interlaken, (Seneca County), New York. A memorial was held at Cornell University&#x27;s Sage Chapel on July 7, 1975. Speakers at the memorial included his daughter Anne and the Reverend John F. Hayward.

==Legacy==

===Television===

Serling began his career when television was a new medium. The first public viewing of an all-electronic television was presented by inventor Philo Farnsworth at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia on August 25, 1934, when Serling was nine years old. Commercial television officially started on July 1, 1941. At the time, there were fewer than seven thousand television sets in the United States, and very few of those were in private homes. Only five months later, the U.S. entered World War II, and the television business was put on hold until the war&#x27;s end, as many of the unsold sets were obtained by the government and repurposed to train air-raid wardens. After World War II ended, money began flowing toward the new medium of television, coinciding with the beginning of Serling&#x27;s writing career. Early programming consisted of newsreels, sporting events and what would be called public-access television today. It was not until 1948 that filmed dramas were first shown, beginning with a show called &quot;Public Prosecutor&quot;. Serling began having serious dramas produced in 1950 and is given credit as one of the first to write scripts specifically for television. As such, he is said to have helped legitimize television drama.

Serling worried that television was on the verge of suffering the same decline as radio. He encouraged sponsors to see television as a platform for the kind of dramatic entertainment that could address important social matters through subtle meanings, instead of being &quot;an animated billboard&quot;.

The format of writing for television was changing rapidly in the early years, but eventually, it settled into a pattern of commercial breaks on each quarter-hour. Writers were forced to work these breaks into their scripts. Serling&#x27;s response to this convention was, &quot;How can you put out a meaningful drama when every fifteen minutes proceedings are interrupted by twelve dancing rabbits with toilet paper? No dramatic art form should be dictated and controlled by men whose training and instincts are cut of an entirely different cloth. The fact remains that these gentlemen sell consumer goods, not an art form.&quot; Throughout his career, Serling helped to mold the future of television.

====Writing for multiple media====
As early as 1955, Jack Gould, of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, commented on the close ties that were then being created between television and movies. Serling was among the first to use both forms, turning his early television successes, &quot;Patterns&quot; and &quot;The Rack&quot;, into full-length movies. Up to that time, many established writers were unwilling to write for television because the programs were viewed only once and then stored in a vault, never to be seen again.

====Beginning of the rerun====
After the first showing of &quot;Patterns&quot;, the studio received such positive feedback that it produced a repeat performance, the first time a television program had been replayed at the request of the audience. Although successful shows had sometimes been recreated after two years or more, this was the first time a show was recreated exactly—with the same cast and crew—as it had been originally broadcast. The second live performance, only a month later, was equally successful and inspired &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Jack Gould to write an essay on the use of replays on television. He stated that &quot;Patterns&quot; was a prime example of a drama that should be seen more than once, whereas a single broadcast was the norm for television shows of the day. Sponsors believed that creating new shows every week would assure them the largest possible audience, so they purchased a new script for each night. Gould suggested that as new networks were opened and the viewers were given more choices, the percentage of viewers would spread among the offerings. &quot;Patterns&quot; was proof that a second showing could gain more viewers because those who missed the first showing could see the second, thus increasing the audience for sponsors.

==Effects on popular culture==

===During his lifetime===
In December 1966, the made-for-television movie &quot;The Doomsday Flight&quot; aired. The fictional plot concerned an airplane with a bomb aboard. If the plane landed without the ransom money being paid, the aircraft would explode. The bomb was set with an altitude trigger that would detonate it if the plane dropped below four thousand feet. The show was one of the highest-rated of the television season, but both Serling and his brother Robert, a technical advisor on the project (a specialist in aviation), regretted making the film. After the film was aired, a rash of copycats telephoned in ransom demands to most of the largest airlines. Serling was truly devastated by what his script had encouraged. He told reporters who flocked to interview him, &quot;I wish to Christ that I had written a stagecoach drama starring John Wayne instead.&quot;

In the 1962 &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode &quot;The Case of the Promoter&#x27;s Pillbox&quot;, the titular promoter falsely claims that a teleplay for a TV pilot, &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot;, is being rewritten by Serling as a personal favor to him. Later, Mason, who does know Serling, shows the original teleplay to him, saying that Serling wants to help the young man who wrote the teleplay to get a start in his writing career. The man&#x27;s mother then expresses to Serling her desire to tell her stories from years of running a drug store.

===Legacy===

Serling is indelibly woven into modern popular culture because of the enduring popularity of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Serling&#x27;s widow, Carol, maintained that the cult status that surrounded both her husband and his shows continues to be a surprise, &quot;as I&#x27;m sure it would have been to him.&quot; &quot;It won&#x27;t go away. It keeps bobbing up. ... Each year, I think, well, that&#x27;s it—and then something else turns up.&quot; She survived him to the age of 90, dying on January 9, 2020, and participated in the continuing interest in Rod&#x27;s work, sometimes preparing them for a new format and editing a publication about Rod that she founded, &quot;The Twilight Zone Magazine&quot;, as well as many activities to promote his legacy.

&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; has been rerun, re-created and re-imagined since going off the air in 1964. It has been released in comic book form, as a magazine, a film, and three additional television series from 1985 to 1989, from 2002 to 2003, and from 2019 to 2020. In 1988, J. Michael Straczynski scripted Serling&#x27;s outline &quot;Our Selena Is Dying&quot; for the 1980s &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; series.

Some of Serling&#x27;s works are now available in graphic novels. &quot;Rod Serling&#x27;s The Twilight Zone&quot; is a series of adaptations by Mark Kneece and Rich Ellis based on original scripts written by Serling. Several episodes were adapted into novel form for pulp fiction books by Serling himself.

&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; is not the only Serling work to reappear. In 1994, &quot;Rod Serling&#x27;s Lost Classics&quot; released two never-before-seen works that Carol Serling found in her garage. The first was an outline called, &quot;The Theatre&quot;, which Richard Matheson expanded. The second was a complete script written by Serling, &quot;Where the Dead Are&quot;.

Serling and his work on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; inspired the Disney theme park attraction &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror, which debuted at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida in 1994. Serling appears in the attraction through the use of repurposed archival footage, and voice actor Mark Silverman provides the dubbing of Serling&#x27;s dialogue for the attraction at both Hollywood Studios and the defunct version at Disney California Adventure in Anaheim. The ride takes place in the once-elegant Hollywood Tower Hotel that was struck by lightning, which caused the mysterious disappearance of five guests. Riders enter an abandoned elevator shaft as they become part of a &quot;lost episode&quot; of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, with the attraction taking guests up 13 stories and dropping them multiple times.

More than 30 years after his death, Serling was digitally resurrected for an episode of the television series &quot;Medium&quot; that aired on November 21, 2005. Filmed partially in 3-D, it opened with Serling&#x27;s introducing the episode and instructing viewers when to put on their 3-D glasses. This was accomplished using footage from &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Midnight Sun&quot; and digitally manipulating Serling&#x27;s mouth to match new dialogue spoken by voice actor Mark Silverman. The plot involved paintings coming to life, a nod to both &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Night Gallery&quot;.

On August 11, 2009, the United States Postal Service released its &quot;Early TV Memories&quot; commemorative stamp collection honoring notable television programs. One of the 20 stamps honored &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and featured a portrait of Serling.

Through a mix of computer animation, a simulated version of Serling appeared at the end of the &quot;Blurryman&quot; episode of the 2019 revival of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. This was done with a facial performance by Ryan Hesp, motion-capture by Jefferson Black, and a voice reprisal by Mark Silverman.

There are several memorials to Serling in his hometown of Binghamton, New York. Annually since 1995, Binghamton High School, Serling&#x27;s alma mater, primarily in partnership with WSKG-TV, hosts the Rod Serling Video Festival for students in kindergarten through grade 12. The festival encourages young people to engage in filmmaking. Likewise, the Rod Serling Memorial Foundation hosts Serlingfest - a celebration of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and Serling’s work - in Binghamton annually. A New York State Historic Marker for Serling stands outside Binghamton High School. On September 15, 2024, a statue of Serling was unveiled in Recreation Park following state grants and online crowdfunding for the memorial, the base of which contains a quote from Serling: “Everybody has a hometown/Binghamton’s mine.”

<doc id="101289" wikidata="Q193974" url="?curid=101289" title="Chartism">
<text>Chartism was a working-class movement for political reform in the United Kingdom that erupted from 1838 to 1857 and was strongest in 1839, 1842 and 1848. It took its name from the People&#x27;s Charter of 1838 and was a national protest movement, with particular strongholds of support in Northern England, the East Midlands, the Staffordshire Potteries, the Black Country and the South Wales Valleys, where working people depended on single industries and were subject to wild swings in economic activity. Chartism was less strong in places, such as Bristol, that had more diversified economies. The movement was fiercely opposed by government authorities, who finally suppressed it.

Support for the movement was at its highest when petitions signed by millions of working people were presented to the House of Commons. The strategy employed was to use the scale of support which these petitions and the accompanying mass meetings demonstrated to put pressure on politicians to concede male suffrage. Chartism thus relied on constitutional methods to secure its aims, though some became involved in insurrectionary activities, notably in South Wales and in Yorkshire.

The People&#x27;s Charter called for six reforms to make the political system more democratic:
* A vote for every man aged twenty-one years and above, of sound mind, and not undergoing punishment for a crime.
* The secret ballot to protect the elector in the exercise of his vote.
* No property qualification for Members of Parliament (MPs), to allow the constituencies to return the man of their choice.
* Payment of Members, enabling tradesmen, working men, or other persons of modest means to leave or interrupt their livelihood to attend to the interests of the nation.
* Equal constituencies, securing the same amount of representation for the same number of electors, instead of allowing less populous constituencies to have as much or more weight than larger ones.
* Annual parliamentary elections, thus presenting the most effectual check to bribery and intimidation, since no purse could buy a constituency under a system of universal manhood suffrage in every twelve months. 
Eventually, after Chartism died out, Britain adopted all but the last of these six reforms. Chartists saw themselves fighting against political corruption and for democracy in an industrial society, but attracted support beyond the radical political groups for economic reasons, such as opposing wage cuts and unemployment.

==Origin==

After the passing of the Reform Act 1832, which failed to extend the vote beyond those owning property, the political leaders of the working class made speeches claiming that there had been a great act of betrayal. This sense that the working class had been betrayed by the middle class was strengthened by the actions of the Whig governments of the 1830s. Notably, the hated new Poor Law Amendment was passed in 1834, depriving working people of outdoor relief and driving the poor into workhouses, where families were separated.

The massive wave of opposition to this measure in the north of England in the late 1830s made Chartism a mass movement. It seemed that only securing the vote for working men would change things. Dorothy Thompson, the preeminent historian of Chartism, defines the movement as the time when &quot;thousands of working people considered that their problems could be solved by the political organization of the country.&quot; In 1836, the London Working Men&#x27;s Association was founded by William Lovett and Henry Hetherington, providing a platform for Chartists in the southeast. The origins of Chartism in Wales can be traced to the foundation in the autumn of 1836 of Carmarthen Working Men&#x27;s Association.

===Press===
Both nationally and locally a Chartist press thrived in the form of periodicals, which were important to the movement for their news, editorials, poetry and especially in 1848, reports on international developments. They reached a huge audience. &quot;The Poor Man&#x27;s Guardian&quot; in the 1830s, edited by Henry Hetherington, dealt with questions of class solidarity, manhood suffrage, property, and temperance, and condemned the Reform Act 1832. The paper explored the rhetoric of violence versus nonviolence, or what its writers called moral versus physical force. 

It was succeeded as the voice of radicalism by an even more famous paper: the &quot;Northern Star and Leeds General Advertiser&quot;. The &quot;Star&quot; was published between 1837 and 1852, and in 1839 was the best-selling provincial newspaper in Britain, with a circulation of 50,000. Like other Chartist papers, it was often read aloud in coffeehouses, workplaces and the open air. Other Chartist periodicals included the &quot;Northern Liberator&quot; (1837–40), &quot;English Chartist Circular&quot; (1841–43), and the &quot;Midland Counties&#x27; Illuminator&quot; (1841). The papers gave justifications for the demands of the People&#x27;s Charter, accounts of local meetings, commentaries on education and temperance and a great deal of poetry. They also advertised upcoming meetings, typically organised by local grassroots branches, held either in public houses or their halls. 

Research of the distribution of Chartist meetings in London that were advertised in the &quot;Northern Star&quot; shows that the movement was not uniformly spread across the metropolis but clustered in the West End, where a group of Chartist tailors had shops, as well as in Shoreditch in the east, and relied heavily on pubs that also supported local friendly societies. Readers also found denunciations of imperialism—the First Opium War (1839–42) was condemned—and of the arguments of free traders about the civilizing and pacifying influences of free trade.

==People&#x27;s Charter of 1838==
In 1837, six Members of Parliament (MPs) and six working men, including William Lovett, from the London Working Men&#x27;s Association, set up in 1836, formed a committee. In 1838, they published the &quot;People&#x27;s Charter&quot;. This set out the movement&#x27;s six main aims. The achievement of these aims would give working men a say in lawmaking: they would be able to vote, their vote would be protected by a secret ballot, and they would be able to stand for election to the House of Commons as a result of the removal of property qualifications and the introduction of payment for MPs. None of these demands were new, but the People&#x27;s Charter became one of the most famous political manifestos of 19th-century Britain.

==Beginnings==
Chartism was launched in 1838 by a series of large-scale meetings in Birmingham, Glasgow and the north of England. A huge mass meeting was held on Kersal Moor near Salford, Lancashire, on 24 September 1838 with speakers from all over the country. Speaking in favour of manhood suffrage, Joseph Rayner Stephens declared that Chartism was a &quot;knife and fork, a bread and cheese question&quot;. These words indicate the importance of economic factors in the launch of Chartism. If, as the movement came together, there were different priorities amongst local leaders, the Charter and the Star soon created a national, and largely united, campaign of national protest. John Bates, an activist, recalled:

The movement organised a National Convention in London in early 1839 to facilitate the presentation of the first petition. Delegates used the term MC, Member of Convention, to identify themselves; the convention undoubtedly saw itself as an alternative parliament. In June 1839, the petition, signed by 1.3 million working people, was presented to the House of Commons, but MPs voted, by a large majority, not to hear the petitioners. At the Convention, there was talk of a general strike or &quot;sacred month&quot;. In the West Riding of Yorkshire and in south Wales, anger went even deeper, and underground preparations for a rising were undoubtedly made.

===Newport Rising===
Several outbreaks of violence ensued, leading to arrests and trials. One of the leaders of the movement, John Frost, on trial for treason, claimed in his defence that he had toured his territory of industrial Wales urging people not to break the law, although he was himself guilty of using language that some might interpret as a call to arms. William Price of Llantrisant—more of a maverick than a mainstream Chartist—described Frost as putting &quot;a sword in my hand and a rope around my neck&quot;. 

Unsurprisingly, there are no surviving letters outlining plans for insurrection, but Chartists had undoubtedly started organising physical force. By early autumn men were being drilled and armed in south Wales and the West Riding. Secret cells were set up, covert meetings were held in the Chartist Caves at Llangynidr and weapons were manufactured as the Chartists armed themselves. Behind closed doors and in pub back rooms, plans were drawn up for a mass protest.

On the night of 3–4 November 1839 Frost led several thousand marchers through South Wales to the Westgate Hotel, Newport, Monmouthshire, where there was a confrontation. It seems that Frost and other local leaders were expecting to seize the town and trigger a national uprising. The result of the Newport Rising was a disaster for Chartism. The hotel was occupied by armed soldiers. A brief, violent, and bloody battle ensued. Shots were fired by both sides, although most contemporaries agree that the soldiers holding the building had vastly superior firepower. The Chartists were forced to retreat in disarray: more than twenty were killed, at least another fifty wounded.

Testimonies exist from contemporaries, such as the Yorkshire Chartist Ben Wilson, that Newport was to have been the signal for a national uprising. Despite this significant setback the movement remained remarkably buoyant and remained so until late 1842. While the majority of Chartists, under the leadership of Feargus O&#x27;Connor, concentrated on petitioning for Frost, Williams and William Jones to be pardoned, significant minorities in Sheffield and Bradford planned their risings in response.

Samuel Holberry led an abortive rising in Sheffield on 12 January, and on 26 January Robert Peddie attempted similar action in Bradford. In both Sheffield and Bradford spies had kept magistrates aware of the conspirators&#x27; plans, and these attempted risings were easily quashed. Frost and two other Newport leaders, Jones and Williams, were transported. Holberry and Peddie received long prison sentences with hard labour; Holberry died in prison and became a Chartist martyr.

==1842==

According to Dorothy Thompson, &quot;1842 was the year in which more energy was hurled against the authorities than in any other of the 19th century&quot;.

In early May 1842, a second petition, of over three million signatures, was submitted, and was yet again rejected by Parliament. The &quot;Northern Star&quot; commented on the rejection:
The depression of 1842 led to a wave of strikes, as workers responded to the wage cuts imposed by employers. Calls for the implementation of the Charter were soon included alongside demands for the restoration of wages to previous levels. Working people went on strike in 14 English and 8 Scottish counties, principally in the Midlands, Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, and the Strathclyde region of Scotland. Typically, strikers resolved to cease work until wages were increased &quot;until the People&#x27;s charter becomes the Law of the Land&quot;. How far these strikes were directly Chartist in inspiration &quot;was then, as now, a subject of much controversy&quot;. 

The &quot;Leeds Mercury&quot; headlined them &quot;The Chartist Insurrection&quot;, but suspicion also hung over the Anti-Corn Law League that manufacturers among its members deliberately closed mills to stir-up unrest. At the time, these disputes were collectively known as the &quot;Plug Plot&quot; as, in many cases, protesters removed the plugs from steam boilers powering industry to prevent their use. Amongst historians writing in the 20th century, the term General Strike was increasingly used. Some modern historians prefer the description &quot;strike wave&quot;. 

In contrast, Mick Jenkins in his &quot;The General Strike of 1842&quot; offers a Marxist interpretation, showing the strikes as highly organized with sophisticated political intentions. The unrest began in the Potteries of Staffordshire in early August, spreading north to Cheshire and Lancashire, where at Manchester a meeting of the Chartist national executive endorsed the strikes on the 16th. The strikes had begun spreading in Scotland and West Yorkshire from the 13th.

There were outbreaks of serious violence, including property destruction and the ambushing of police convoys, in the Potteries and the West Riding. Though the government deployed soldiers to suppress violence, it was the practical problems in sustaining an indefinite stoppage that ultimately defeated the strikers. The drift back to work began on 19 August. Only Lancashire and Cheshire were still strike-bound by September, the Manchester power loom weavers being the last to return to work on 26 September.

The state hit back. Several Chartist leaders were arrested, including O&#x27;Connor, George Julian Harney, and Thomas Cooper. During the late summer of 1842, hundreds were incarcerated. In the Pottery Riots alone, 116 men and women went to prison. A smaller number, but still amounting to many dozens—such as William Ellis, who was convicted on perjured evidence—were transported. One protester, Josiah Heapy, 19 years old, was shot dead. The government&#x27;s most ambitious prosecution, personally led by the Attorney General, of O&#x27;Connor and 57 others, including almost all Chartism&#x27;s national executive failed: none was convicted of the serious charges, and those found guilty of minor offences were never sentenced. Cooper alone of the national Chartist leadership was convicted at a different trial, having spoken at strike meetings in the Potteries. He wrote a long poem in prison called &quot;
‘The Purgatory of Suicides’.

In December 1842 the Chartists held a joint national delegate conference with the National Complete Suffrage Union in Birmingham. Tensions with the NCSU soon surfaced and came to a head over their proposals both for a union with the Anti-Corn Law League, which was also broadly middle class, and for rewriting the People&#x27;s Charter as a legislative Bill of Rights. In both, O&#x27;Connor perceived a threat to his leadership, and unable to find agreement the NCSU leader Joseph Sturge withdrew. In May 1843 William Sharman Crawford introduced the NCSU approved bill to &quot;a small and bored&quot; House of Commons.

==Mid-1840s==
Despite this second set of arrests, Chartist activity continued. Beginning in 1843, O&#x27;Connor suggested that the land contained the solution to workers&#x27; problems. This idea evolved into the Chartist Co-operative Land Company, later called the National Land Company. Workers would buy shares in the company, and the company would use those funds to purchase estates that would be subdivided into 2, 3, and 4 acres (0.8, 1.2, and 1.6  hectare) lots. Between 1844 and 1848, five estates were purchased, subdivided, and built on, and then settled by lucky shareholders, who were chosen by lot.

In 1848 a Select Committee was appointed by Parliament to investigate the financial viability of the scheme, and it was ordered that it be shut down. Cottages built by the Chartist Land Company are still standing and inhabited today in Oxfordshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and on the outskirts of London. Rosedene, a Chartist cottage in Dodford, Worcestershire, is owned and maintained by the National Trust, and is open to visitors by appointment.

Candidates embracing Chartism also stood on numerous occasions in general elections. There were concerted campaigns in the election of 1841 and election of 1847, when O&#x27;Connor was elected for Nottingham. O&#x27;Connor became the only Chartist to be elected an MP; it was a remarkable victory for the movement. More commonly, Chartist candidates participated in the open meetings, called hustings, that were the first stage of an election. They frequently won the show of hands at the hustings, but then withdrew from the poll to expose the deeply undemocratic nature of the electoral system. This is what Harney did in a widely reported challenge against Lord Palmerston in Tiverton, Devon, in 1847. The last Chartist challenge at a parliamentary poll took place at Ripon in 1859.

==1848 petition==

In February 1848, following the arrival of news of a revolution in Paris, Chartist activity increased. In March there were protests or bread riots in Manchester, Glasgow, and Dublin, and a new demonstration was announced for 10 April 1848, to be held on Kennington Common, London. After the meeting, a planned procession would carry a third petition to Parliament. Marches and demonstrations were also planned for April 10 in Manchester and elsewhere.

In anticipation of the announced march, Parliament revived a statute dating to the time of Charles II that forbade more than 10 persons from presenting a petition in person. That was followed on April 7 by new legislation making certain seditious acts &quot;proposing to make war against the Queen, or seeking to intimidate or overawe both Houses of Parliament&quot; or openly speaking or writing &quot;to that effect&quot; felonies in Great Britain and Ireland, punishable by death or transportation. The authorities knew that the Chartists were planning a peaceful demonstration, but still wanted a large-scale display of force to counter the challenge, so 100,000 special constables were recruited to bolster the police force.

O&#x27;Connor, seeing that any form of resistance to authorities would be impossible, cancelled the planned procession to Parliament to present the petition. The meeting was peaceful and finished without incident, after which the petition with its many signatures was sent to Parliament in three cabs accompanied by a small group of Chartist leaders.

Parliament&#x27;s repressive measures strengthened an already-present impulse to violent resistance. In June there was widespread drilling and arming in the West Riding and the devising of plots in London. In Bingley, Yorkshire, a group of &quot;physical force&quot; Chartists led by Isaac Ickeringill were involved in a huge fracas at the local magistrates&#x27; court and later were prosecuted for rescuing two of their compatriots from the police. William Cuffay, a London labour activist and one of the organisers of the Kennington Common rally, was convicted of &quot;conspiring to levy war&quot; against the Queen and transported to Australia.

== Decline after 1848 ==
Chartism as an organized movement declined rapidly after 1848. Throughout the 1850s, pockets of strong support for Chartism could still be found in places such as the Black Country, but the final National Convention, held in 1858, was attended by only a handful of delegates.

Robert George Gammage, a veteran chartist and later historian of the movement, blamed Chartism&#x27;s decline on O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s egotism and vanity, but more recent historians (notably Dorothy Thompson) have tended to see the process as too complex to be attributed to the personality of a single individual.

Ernest Charles Jones became a leading figure in the National Charter Association during its decline, together with George Julian Harney, and helped to give the movement a clearer socialist direction. Jones and Harney knew Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels personally. Marx and Engels at the same time commented on the Chartist movement and Jones&#x27; work in their letters and articles.

In Kennington, the Brandon Estate featured a large mural by Tony Hollaway, commissioned by London County Council&#x27;s Edward Hollamby in the early 1960s, commemorating the Chartists&#x27; meeting on 10 April 1848.

==Christianity==
During this period, a widely held religious doctrine of early Christianity in England had taken hold &quot;to the effect that it was &#x27;wrong for a Christian to meddle in political matters.&#x27; All of the denominations were particularly careful to disavow any political affiliation and he who was the least concerned with the &#x27;affairs of this world&#x27; was considered the most saintly and worthy of emulation.&quot; This was at odds with many Christian Chartists, for &quot;Christianity was to them above all practical, something that must be carried into every walk of life. Furthermore, there was no possibility of divorcing it from political science.&quot; 

William Hill, a Swedenborgian minister, wrote in the &quot;Northern Star&quot;: &quot;We are commanded . . . to love our neighbors as ourselves . . . this command is universal in its application, whether as a friend, Christian or citizen. A man may be devout as a Christian, . . . but if as a citizen he claims rights for himself he refuses to confer upon others, he fails to fulfil the precept of Christ . . .&quot; The conflicts between these two views led many like Joseph Barker to see Britain&#x27;s churches as pointless. &quot;I have no faith in church organisations,&quot; he explained. &quot;I believe it my duty to be a man; to live and move in the world at large; to battle with evil wherever I see it, and to aim at the annihilation of all corrupt institutions and the establishment of all good, and generous, and useful institutions in their places.&quot; 

To further this idea, some Christian Chartist churches were formed where Christianity and radical politics were combined and considered inseparable. More than 20 Chartist churches existed in Scotland by 1841. Pamphlets made the point and vast audiences came to hear lectures on the same themes by the likes of J. R. Stephens, who was highly influential in the movement. Political preachers thus came into prominence.

Between late 1844 and November 1845, subscriptions were raised for the publication of a hymnal, which was printed as a 64-page pamphlet and distributed for a nominal fee, although no known copy is thought to remain. In 2011, a previously unknown and uncatalogued smaller pamphlet of 16 hymns was discovered in Todmorden Library in the North of England. This is believed to be the only Chartist Hymnal in existence. Heavily influenced by dissenting Christians, the hymns are about social justice, &quot;striking down evildoers&quot;, and blessing Chartist enterprises, rather than the conventional themes of crucifixion, heaven, and family. 

Some of the hymns protest the exploitation of child labour and slavery. One proclaims, &quot;Men of wealth and men of power/ Like locusts all thy gifts devour&quot;. Two celebrate the martyrs of the movement. &quot;Great God! Is this the Patriot&#x27;s Doom?&quot; was composed for the funeral of Samuel Holberry, the Sheffield Chartist leader, who died in prison in 1843, while another honours John Frost, Zephaniah Williams, and William Jones, the Chartist leaders transported to Tasmania in the aftermath of the Newport rising of 1839.

The Chartists were especially critical of the Church of England for unequal distribution of the state funds it received, resulting in some bishops and higher dignitaries having grossly larger incomes than other clergymen. This state of affairs led some Chartists to question the very idea of a state-sponsored church, leading them to call for absolute separation of church and state.

Facing severe persecution in 1839, Chartists took to attending services at churches they held in contempt to display their numerical strength and express their dissatisfaction. Often they forewarned the preacher and demanded that he preach from texts they believed supported their cause, such as 2 Thessalonians 3:10, 2 Timothy 2:6, Matthew 19:23 and James 5:1–6. In response, the set-upon ministers often preached the need to focus on things spiritual and not material, and of meekness and obedience to authority, citing such passages as Romans 13:1–7 and 1 Peter 2:13–17.

==Leadership==
Dorothy Thompson argues that, &quot;Chartism was a movement whose members, supporters, and most of its leaders, were working men. A few were shopkeepers, innkeepers or marginal members of lesser professions.&quot; Ernest Jones (1819–1869), was born into the landed gentry, became a barrister, and left a large documentary record. &quot;He is the best-remembered of the Chartist leaders, among the pioneers of the modern Labour movement, and a friend of both Marx and Engels.&quot;

According to Thompson, Feargus O&#x27;Connor the proprietor of the &quot;Northern Star&quot; was the &quot;most well-loved man&quot; of the movement: For the Chartists ... O&#x27;Connor was the acknowledged leader of the movement. Abler men among the leadership there certainly were and men with a clearer sense of direction in which a working-class movement should go, but none of them had the appeal which O&#x27;Connor had nor his ability to win the confidence and support of the great crowds who made up the Chartist meetings in their heyday. Over 6 ft (183 cm) tall—he was almost the tallest man in the House of Commons—and with a voice which could easily carry an open-air meetings of tens of thousands, with a handsome appearance, a quick wit and a rich vein of scurrility when it came to abusing his opponents, Connor possessed all the qualities of the first rate popular orator. 

Many of the early historians of Chartism attributed the failure of Chartism at least in part to O&#x27;Connor. He was accused of egotism and of being quarrelsome. In recent years, however, there has been a trend to reassess him in a more favourable light.

According to Thompson, George Julian Harney: is a particularly good figure to take as central to the study of Chartism. For five years (1845–50) he was the editor of the &quot;Northern Star.&quot; He was one of the few leading figures who entered the movement in its earliest days—coming in straight from an active part in the dramatic and principled fight against the stamp duties on newspapers which is one of the highlights of 19th century radical action—and remained active throughout the years of its mass influence. 

According to Tristram Hunt:George Julian Harney, Chartism&#x27;s enfant terrible ... was firmly on the radical side of the movement, advocating the use of physical force and enjoying riling his conservative comrades by flaunting the red cap of liberty at public meetings. In and out of jail, endlessly feuding with fellow Chartists, and ultimately expelled from the party, the Robespierre-admiring Harney remained convinced that insurrection was the surest route to achieve the demands of the charter.

==Legacy==

Malcolm Chase argues that Chartism was not, &quot;a movement that failed but a movement characterized by multiplicity of small victories.&quot; Moreover, eventually &quot;Chartism collapsed, but &quot;Chartists&quot; did not.&quot;

===Eventual reforms===
Chartism did not directly generate any reforms. However after 1848, as the movement faded, its demands appeared less threatening and were gradually enacted by other reformers. Middle-class parliamentary Radicals continued to press for an extension of the franchise in such organisations as the National Parliamentary and Financial Reform Association and the Reform Union. By the late 1850s, the celebrated John Bright was agitating in the country for franchise reform. But working-class radicals had not gone away. The Reform League campaigned for manhood suffrage in the 1860s and included former Chartists in its ranks.

In 1867 part of the urban working men was admitted to the franchise under the Reform Act 1867, and in 1918 full manhood suffrage was achieved. Other points of the People&#x27;s Charter were granted: secret voting was introduced in 1872 and the payment of MPs in 1911. Annual elections remain the only Chartist demand not to be implemented.

===Enabling political progressions===
Political elites feared the Chartists in the 1830s and 1840s as a dangerous threat to national stability. In the Chartist stronghold of Manchester, the movement undermined the political power of the old Tory-Anglican elite that had controlled civic affairs. But the reformers of Manchester were themselves factionalised. Chartism has also been seen as a forerunner to the UK Labour Party.

===Development of working class confidence===
Participation in the Chartist Movement filled some working men with self-confidence: they learned to speak publicly, to send their poems and other writings off for publication—to be able, in short, to confidently articulate the feelings of working people. Many former Chartists went on to become journalists, poets, ministers, and councillors.

===Colonies===
Chartism was also an important influence in some British colonies. Some leaders were punished by transportation to Australia, where they spread their beliefs. In 1854, Chartist demands were put forward by the miners at the Eureka Stockade on the gold fields at Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. Within two years of the military suppression of the Eureka revolt, the first elections of the Victoria parliament were held, with near-universal male suffrage and by secret ballot. (and with the successful use of secret voting in Australia, it spread to the UK and Canada in the 1870s, and later gradually to the U.S.)

It has been argued that Chartist influence in Australia led to other reforms in the late 19th century and well into the 20th century, including women&#x27;s suffrage, relatively short three-year parliamentary terms, preferential voting (Instant-runoff voting), compulsory voting and single transferable vote proportional representation.

In the African colonies after 1920, there were occasional appearances of a &quot;colonial Chartism&quot; that called for improved welfare, upgraded education, freedom of speech, and greater political representation for native people.

<text>Isabelle Yasmine Adjani (born 27 June 1955) is a French actress and singer of Algerian and German descent. She has received various accolades, including five César Awards and a Lumière Award, along with nominations for two Academy Awards. Adjani was made a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 2010 and a Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2014.

Adjani has won a record five Césars for Best Actress for &quot;Possession&quot; (1981), &quot;One Deadly Summer&quot; (1983), &quot;Camille Claudel&quot; (1988), &quot;La Reine Margot&quot; (1994), and &quot;La Journée de la jupe&quot; (2009). Her other César-nominated roles were in &quot;The Story of Adèle H.&quot; (1975), &quot;Barocco&quot; (1976), &quot;Subway&quot; (1985), and &quot;The World Is Yours&quot; (2018). Other notable films include &quot;The Slap&quot; (1974), &quot;The Tenant&quot; (1976), &quot;The Driver&quot; (1978), &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot; (1979), &quot;All Fired Up&quot; (1982), &quot;Deadly Circuit&quot; (1983), &quot;Ishtar&quot; (1987), &quot;Diabolique&quot; (1996), &quot;Adolphe&quot; (2002), &quot;Bon voyage&quot; (2003), &quot;French Women&quot; (2014), and &quot;Peter von Kant&quot; (2022).

Adjani came to international prominence for her portrayal of Adèle Hugo in &quot;The Story of Adele H.&quot;, for which she received the Academy Award for Best Actress nomination at 20 and became the youngest nominee in that category at the time. She later collected a second Best Actress nomination for portraying Camille Claudel in &quot;Camille Claudel&quot;, thus becoming the first French actress to receive two Academy Award nominations for foreign-language films. Adjani also won the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Best Actress Award for her performances in &quot;Possession&quot; and &quot;Quartet&quot; (1981), which makes her the only actress to win a joint award for two films in the same competition slate, and the Berlinale&#x27;s Silver Bear for Best Actress for &quot;Camille Claudel&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Isabelle Yasmine Adjani was born on 27 June 1955 in the 17th arrondissement of Paris, to Mohammed Cherif Adjani, an Algerian Muslim from Constantine, and Emma Augusta &quot;Gusti&quot; Schweinberger, a German Catholic from Bavaria.

Adjani&#x27;s parents met near the end of World War II, when her father was in the French Army and stationed in Germany. They married and her mother returned with him to Paris, despite not speaking a word of French. She asked him to take Cherif as his first name as she thought it sounded more &quot;American&quot;.

Isabelle grew up bilingual, speaking French and German fluently, in Gennevilliers, a northwestern suburb of Paris, where her father worked in a garage. After winning a school recitation contest, Adjani began acting by the age of 12 in amateur theater. She successfully passed her baccalauréat and was auditing classes at the University of Vincennes in 1976.

Adjani had a younger brother, Éric, who was a photographer. He died on 25 December 2010, aged 53.

==Acting career==

At the age of 14, Adjani starred in her first motion picture, &quot;&quot; (1970). She first gained fame as a classical actress at the Comédie-Française, which she joined in 1972. She was praised for her interpretation of Agnès, the main female role in Molière&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;École des femmes.&quot; She soon left the theatre to pursue a film career.

After minor roles in several films, she enjoyed modest success in the 1974 film &quot;La Gifle&quot; (&quot;The Slap&quot;), which François Truffaut saw. He immediately cast her in her first major role in &quot;The Story of Adèle H.&quot; (1975), a project that he had finished writing five years prior but had waited to cast the right actress for the part. Critics unanimously praised her performance, with the American critic Pauline Kael describing her acting talents as &quot;prodigious&quot;.

Only 19 when she made the film, Adjani was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, becoming the youngest Best Actress nominee at the time (a record she held for almost 30 years). She quickly received offers for roles in Hollywood films, such as Walter Hill&#x27;s 1978 crime thriller &quot;The Driver&quot;. She had previously turned down the chance to star in films like &quot;The Other Side of Midnight.&quot; She had described Hollywood as a &quot;city of fiction&quot; and said, &quot;I&#x27;m not an American. I didn&#x27;t grow up with that will to win an award.&quot; Truffaut on the other hand said, &quot;France is too small for her. I think Isabelle is made for American cinema.&quot; She agreed to make &quot;The Driver&quot; because she was an admirer of Hill&#x27;s first film &quot;Hard Times&quot;. Adjani said:
I think he is wonderful, very much in the tradition of Howard Hawks, lean and spare. The story is contemporary but also very stylized, and the roles that Ryan and I play are like Bogart and Bacall. We are both gamblers in our souls and we do not show our emotions or say a lot. For us, talk is cheap. I am really quite a mysterious girl in this film, with no name and no background. And I must say that it is restful not to have a life behind me; this way, I don&#x27;t have to dig deep to play the part. All I know is that life for me is gambling and I am a loser. I have what people call a poker face.
The film was seen more than 1.1 million times in Adjani&#x27;s native France but did not do as well in the US.

She played Lucy in the German director Werner Herzog&#x27;s 1979 remake of &quot;&quot; which was well-received critically and performed well at box offices in Europe. Roger Ebert loved the film, calling Herzog&#x27;s casting of Adjani one of his &quot;masterstrokes&quot; in the film. He wrote that she &quot;is used here not only for her facial perfection but for her curious quality of seeming to exist on an ethereal plane.&quot; The cast and the crew filmed both English- and German-language versions simultaneously upon request of 20th Century Fox, the American distributor, as Kinski and Bruno Ganz could act more confidently in their native language.

In 1981, she received a double Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Best Actress award for her roles in the Merchant Ivory film &quot;Quartet,&quot; based on the novel by Jean Rhys, and in the horror film &quot;Possession&quot; (1981). The following year, she received her first César Award for &quot;Possession&quot;, in which she had portrayed a woman having a nervous breakdown. 

In 1983, she won her second César for her depiction of a vengeful woman in the French blockbuster &quot;One Deadly Summer&quot;, and starred with Michel Serrault in the black diamond thriller &quot;Deadly Circuit&quot; directed by Claude Miller. That same year, Adjani released the French pop album &quot;Pull marine&quot;, written and produced by Serge Gainsbourg. She then starred in a music video for the hit title song, &quot;Pull Marine&quot;, which was directed by Luc Besson.

Adjani also drew controversy at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival when she refused to attend a traditional photocall after the press conference for &quot;One Deadly Summer&quot;. Adjani was annoyed at the time by the intrusion of photographers into her private life. The photographers in Cannes boycotted Adjani upon her arrival on the red carpet for the premiere, at which point they put down their cameras down and turned their backs to her.

In 1988, she co-produced and starred in a biopic of the sculptor &quot;Camille Claudel&quot;. She received her third César and second Oscar nomination for her role in the film, becoming the first French actress to receive two Oscar nominations. The film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

She received her fourth César for the 1994 film &quot;Queen Margot&quot;, an ensemble epic directed by Patrice Chéreau. She received her fifth César for &quot;Skirt Day&quot; (2009), the most that any actress has received. The film features her as a middle school teacher in a troubled French suburb who takes her class hostage when she accidentally fires off a gun she found on one of her students. It was premiered on the French Arte channel on 20 March 2009, attaining a record 2.2 million viewers) and then in movie theaters on 25 March 2009. The film was her return to the cinema after eight years of absence. 

In 2010, she made an appearance in the social comedy &quot;Mammuth&quot;, from directors Benoît Delépine and Gustave Kervern, and in which she played the phantom of Gérard Depardieu&#x27;s first love. The same year, she lent her voice to the character of Mother Gothel in the french version of the animated film &quot;Tangled&quot;. In 2011, she co-starred in &quot;De Force&quot;, the first film directed by Frank Henry. She embodied the commander Clara Damico, head of the brigade for the repression of banditry. 

She became the first French actress to star in a Bollywood film, playing the mother of Preity Zinta in the 2013 romantic comedy &quot;Ishkq in Paris&quot;, directed by Prem Soni and alongside Shekhar Kapur.

She joined the comedy &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;, playing the eccentric Dany, directed by Romain Gavras alongside Vincent Cassel, which entered into the Directors&#x27; Fortnight during the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2022, she played the movie star Sidonie von Grassenabb in the comedy drama &quot;Peter von Kant&quot;, tribute to Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot;, directed by François Ozon alongside Denis Ménochet, which entered as the opening film into the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival.

In 2023, Adjani released her second French pop album &quot;Bande originale&quot;, written and produced by Pascal Obispo, and arranged by Cécile DeLaurentis. She also joined the Netflix action film &quot;Wingwomen&quot;, directed by Mélanie Laurent, and then, the Netflix miniseries &quot;The Perfect Couple&quot; directed by Susanne Bier, alongside Nicole Kidman and Liev Schreiber.

==Personal life==
In 1979, Adjani had a son, Barnabé Saïd-Nuytten, with the cinematographer Bruno Nuytten. She later hired Nuytten to direct her project &quot;Camille Claudel,&quot; a biopic of the sculptor who was the lover of Rodin.

During the mid-eighties, she had a relationship with Warren Beatty. He convinced her to appear with him in the epic comedy &quot;Ishtar&quot;, directed by Elaine May, co-starring Dustin Hoffman, and shot in Morocco.

From 1989 to 1995, she had a relationship with Daniel Day-Lewis, which ended before the birth of their son, Gabriel-Kane Day-Lewis, in 1995.

Adjani was later engaged to the composer Jean-Michel Jarre; they broke up in 2004.

On 14 December 2023, Adjani was handed a two-year suspended sentence for tax fraud.

===Political views===
Adjani has been vocal against anti-immigrant and anti-Algerian sentiments in France. In 2009, she criticized statements by Pope Benedict XVI, who claimed that condoms are not an effective method of AIDS prevention.

In September 2009, she signed a petition in support of Roman Polanski, calling for his release after he was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his sexual abuse case.

In 2017, Adjani was interviewed by Vincent Josse on the French public radio station France Inter. During the interview, she expressed her vaccine hesitancy and opposition to mandatory vaccination.

In 2018 Adjani signed a letter calling to act &quot;firmly and immediately&quot; for stopping climate change and biodiversity loss.

<text>Khan Yunis (), also spelled Khan Younis or Khan Yunus, is a Palestinian city serving as the capital of the Khan Yunis Governorate in the southern Gaza Strip. It has been largely destroyed on account of the ongoing Israel–Hamas war.

Before the 14th century, Khan Yunis was a village known as &quot;Salqah&quot;. To protect caravans, pilgrims and travellers a vast caravanserai – today known as Barquq Castle – was constructed there by the emir Yūnus an-Nūrūzī in 1387–88, an official of the Mamluk Empire.

According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Khan Yunis had a population of 205,125 in 2017. Khan Yunis, which lies only east of the Mediterranean Sea, has a semi-arid climate with temperature of 30 °C maximum in summer and 10 °C minimum in winter, with an annual rainfall of approximately .

==History==
===Ancient period===
Herodotus describes a city named &quot;Ienysos&quot; () located between Lake Serbonis and Kadytis (modern Gaza city). He talks about how the Persian military marched through the location on its way to Egypt. He also describes how the coastal area between Kadytis and Ienysos was inhabited by local Arab tribes. Some sources, due to phonological resemblance of the names and due to the general matching of the geographic locations, associate this site with modern Khan Yunis.

Other sources have suggested a further inland location of &quot;Khirbet Ma&#x27;in Abu Sitta&quot; (Palestinian village depopulated in 1949, near modern kibbutz of Nir Oz) or the Egyptian town of Arish as possible locations of Ienysos, but there is no clear evidence to support this identification.

Ancient discoveries in Khan Yunis feature a lintel with a Greek inscription, discovered repurposed in the tomb of Sheikh Hamada. The inscription translates to: &quot;&#x27;Hilarion - giving thanks to St. Georgius&quot;.&#x27; Originally housed in the Musée de Notre Dame de France in Jerusalem, the lintel is currently lost.

===Establishment by Mamluks===

Before the 14th century, Khan Yunis was a village known as &quot;Salqah&quot;. To protect caravans, pilgrims and travellers a vast caravan serai – today known as Barquq Castle – was constructed there by &quot;emir&quot; Yūnus an-Nūrūzī in 1387–88, an official of the Mamluk Empire. The growing town surrounding it was named &quot;Khan Yunis&quot; after him. In 1389 Yunus was killed in battle. Yunus ibn Abdallah an-Nuruzi ad-Dawadar was the executive secretary (), one of the high-ranking officials of the Mamluk sultan Barquq. The town became an important center for trade and its weekly Thursday market drew traders from neighboring regions.&quot;

The khan served as resting stop for couriers of the &quot;barid&quot;, the Mamluk postal network in Palestine and Syria.

===Ottoman period===
In late 1516 Khan Yunis was the site of a minor battle in which the Egypt-based Mamluks were defeated by Ottoman forces under the leadership of Sinan Pasha. The Ottoman sultan Selim I then arrived in the area where he led the Ottoman army across the Sinai Peninsula to conquer Egypt. During the 17th and 18th centuries the Ottomans assigned an Asappes garrison associated with the Cairo Citadel to guard the fortress at Khan Yunis.

Pierre Jacotin named the village &quot;Kan Jounes&quot; on his map from 1799, while in 1838, Robinson noted &quot;Khan Yunas&quot; as a Muslim village located in the Gaza district. In 1863 French explorer Victor Guérin visited Khan Yunis. He found it had about a thousand inhabitants, and that many fruit trees, especially apricots were planted in the vicinity.

At the end of the 19th-century the Ottomans established a municipal council to administer the affairs of Khan Yunis, which had become the second largest town in the Gaza District after Gaza itself.

===British Mandate===

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Khan Yunis had a population of 3890 inhabitants (3866 Muslims, 23 Christians, and one Jew), decreasing in the 1931 census to 3811 (3767 Muslims, 41 Christians, and three Jews), in 717 houses in the urban area and 3440 (3434 Muslims and 6 Christians) in 566 houses in the suburbs.

In the 1938 village statistics, the population is listed as 4,379 (including three Jews) with 3,953 in nearby suburbs. In the 1945 statistics, Khan Yunis had a population of 11,220 (11,180 Muslims and 40 Christians), with 2,302 (urban) and 53,820 (rural) dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 4,172 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 23,656 used for cereals, while 1,847 dunams were built-up land.

During the Nazi occupation of the Dodecanese, many Greeks from Dodecanese islands such as Kastelorizo sought refuge in the nearby Nuseirat Camp.

===1948–1967===
During the night of 31 August 1955, three Israeli paratroop companies attacked the British-built Tegart fort in Khan Yunis from where attacks had been carried out against Israelis. The police station, a petrol station and several buildings in the village of Abasan were destroyed, as well as railway tracks and telegraph poles. In heavy fighting, 72 Egyptian soldiers were killed. One Israeli soldier was killed and 17 were wounded. The operation led to a ceasefire on September 4, forcing President Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Egyptian government to halt Palestinian fedayeen operations against Israel. One of the mechanized companies was commanded by Rafael Eitan.

Before the Suez War, Khan Yunis was officially administered by the All-Palestine Government, seated in Gaza and later in Cairo. After a fierce firefight, the Sherman tanks of the IDF 37th Armored Brigade broke through the heavily fortified lines outside of Khan Yunis held by the 86th Palestinian Brigade. It was the only site in the Gaza strip where the Egyptian army put up any resistance to the Israeli invasion of Gaza, but it surrendered on 3 November 1956.

There are conflicting reports of what happened. Israel said that Palestinians were killed when Israeli forces were still facing armed resistance, while the Palestinians said all resistance had ceased by then, and that many unarmed civilians were killed as the Israel troops went through the town and camp, seeking men in possession of arms.

The killings, dubbed the Khan Yunis massacre, were reported to the UN General Assembly on 15 December 1956 by the Director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, Henry Labouisse. According to the report, the exact number of dead and wounded is not known, but the director received lists of names of persons allegedly killed from a trustworthy source, including 275 people, of which 140 were refugees and 135 local residents.

After 1959, the All-Palestine Government of Gaza Strip was abolished and the city was included in the United Arab Republic, which was shortly disestablished and the Gaza Strip came under the direct Egyptian military occupation rule.

===1967 and aftermath===
In 1967, during the Six-Day War, Israel occupied Khan Yunis again.

As a result of the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords, Khan Yunis and most of the Gaza Strip (excluding Israeli settlements and military areas) were placed under the control of the Palestinian Authority.

Khan Yunis was the site of Israeli helicopter attacks in August 2001 and October 2002 that left several civilians killed, hundreds wounded and civilian buildings within the vicinity destroyed.

The Palestinian Authority came into control of the entirety of the Strip following the 2005 Israeli disengagement. However, following the Battle of Gaza in 2007, Hamas took over the Gaza Strip and established its own government in the region.

===Israel–Hamas war===
During the ongoing Israel–Hamas war, Israel has bombed Khan Yunis along with other cities in the Gaza Strip as part of an offensive against Hamas. The Israeli Air Force extensively bombed much of the city, including the Hamad City apartment complex. Local sources have reported numerous civilian casualties in Khan Yunis as a result of Israeli bombings, which Palestinian news agency Wafa put at &quot;at least 70&quot; as of December 3. The Al Qarara Cultural Museum was destroyed in an explosion as a result of an Israeli attack in October 2023, part of an offensive that reportedly targeted civilian homes and mosques in the vicinity. Israeli armored units began entering the outskirts of the city in December 2023. After several months of fighting, Israeli forces ended up withdrawing from Khan Yunis and most of the southern Gaza Strip. Having failed to root out Hamas from Khan Yunis, Israeli forces began a second invasion of the city in late July 2024, which also ended in an Israeli withdrawal. Israeli forces invaded Khan Yunis yet again in August 2024, and withdrew once more at the end of the month. Following the 2025 ceasefire, Hamas forces were seen parading through Khan Yunis.

==Economy==
Khan Yunis is the second largest urban area in the Gaza Strip after Gaza City. It serves as the principal market center of the territory&#x27;s southern half and hosts a weekly Bedouin &quot;souk&quot; (&quot;open-air market&quot;) mostly involving local commodities. Khan Yunis had the highest unemployment rate in the Palestinian territories.

<doc id="101334" wikidata="Q3343104" url="?curid=101334" title="Euler–Jacobi pseudoprime">
<text>In number theory, an odd integer &quot;n&quot; is called an Euler–Jacobi probable prime (or, more commonly, an Euler probable prime) to base &quot;a&quot;, if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are coprime, and 

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the Jacobi symbol. The Jacobi symbol evaluates to 0 if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are not coprime, so the test can alternatively be expressed as:

:formula_3

If &quot;n&quot; is an odd composite integer that satisfies the above congruence, then &quot;n&quot; is called an Euler–Jacobi pseudoprime (or, more commonly, an Euler pseudoprime) to base &quot;a&quot;.

As long as &quot;a&quot; is not a multiple of &quot;n&quot; (usually 2 ≤ &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;), then if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are not coprime, &quot;n&quot; is definitely composite, as 1 &lt; gcd(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) &lt; &quot;n&quot; is a factor of &quot;n&quot;.

== Properties ==

The motivation for this definition is the fact that all prime numbers &quot;n&quot; satisfy the above equation, as explained in the Euler&#x27;s criterion article. The equation can be tested rather quickly, which can be used for probabilistic primality testing. These tests are over twice as strong as tests based on Fermat&#x27;s little theorem. 

Every Euler–Jacobi pseudoprime is also a Fermat pseudoprime and an Euler pseudoprime. There are no numbers which are Euler–Jacobi pseudoprimes to all bases as Carmichael numbers are. Solovay and Strassen showed that for every composite &quot;n&quot;, for at least &quot;n&quot;/2 bases less than &quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; is not an Euler–Jacobi pseudoprime.

The smallest Euler–Jacobi pseudoprime base 2 is 561. There are 11347 Euler–Jacobi pseudoprimes base 2 that are less than 25·109 (see ) (page 1005 of ).

In the literature (for example,), an Euler–Jacobi pseudoprime as defined above is often called simply an Euler pseudoprime.

==Implementation in Lua==

 function EulerJacobiTest(k)
 a = 2
 if k == 1 then return false
 elseif k == 2 then return true
 else
 if(modPow(a,(k-1)/2,k) == Jacobi(a,k)) then
 return true
 else
 return false
 end
 end
 end

<text>High-temperature superconductivity (high-c or HTS) is superconductivity in materials with a critical temperature (the temperature below which the material behaves as a superconductor) above , the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. They are only &quot;high-temperature&quot; relative to previously known superconductors, which function at colder temperatures, close to absolute zero. The &quot;high temperatures&quot; are still far below ambient (room temperature), and therefore require cooling. The first breakthrough of high-temperature superconductor was discovered in 1986 by IBM researchers Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller. Although the critical temperature is around , this new type of superconductor was readily modified by Ching-Wu Chu to make the first high-temperature superconductor with critical temperature . Bednorz and Müller were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1987 &quot;for their important break-through in the discovery of superconductivity in ceramic materials&quot;. Most high-c materials are type-II superconductors.

The major advantage of high-temperature superconductors is that they can be cooled using liquid nitrogen, in contrast to the previously known superconductors that require expensive and hard-to-handle coolants, primarily liquid helium. A second advantage of high-c materials is they retain their superconductivity in higher magnetic fields than previous materials. This is important when constructing superconducting magnets, a primary application of high-c materials.

The majority of high-temperature superconductors are ceramic materials, rather than the previously known metallic materials. Ceramic superconductors are suitable for some practical uses but they still have many manufacturing issues. For example, most ceramics are brittle, which makes the fabrication of wires from them very problematic. However, overcoming these drawbacks is the subject of considerable research, and progress is ongoing.

The main class of high-temperature superconductors is copper oxides combined with other metals, especially the rare-earth barium copper oxides (REBCOs) such as yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO). The second class of high-temperature superconductors in the practical classification is the iron-based compounds.
Magnesium diboride is sometimes included in high-temperature superconductors: It is relatively simple to manufacture, but it superconducts only below , which makes it unsuitable for liquid nitrogen cooling.

== History ==
Superconductivity was discovered by Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911, in a metal solid. Ever since, researchers have attempted to observe superconductivity at increasing temperatures with the goal of finding a room-temperature superconductor. By the late 1970s, superconductivity was observed in several metallic compounds (in particular Nb-based, such as NbTi, Nb3Sn, and Nb3Ge) at temperatures that were much higher than those for elemental metals and which could even exceed .

In 1986, at the IBM research lab near Zürich in Switzerland, Bednorz and Müller were looking for superconductivity in a new class of ceramics: the &quot;copper oxides&quot;, or &quot;cuprates&quot;.

Bednorz encountered a particular copper oxide whose resistance dropped to zero at a temperature around . Their results were soon confirmed by many groups, notably Paul Chu at the University of Houston and Shoji Tanaka at the University of Tokyo.

In 1987, Philip W. Anderson gave the first theoretical description of these materials, based on the resonating valence bond (RVB) theory, but a full understanding of these materials is still developing today. These superconductors are now known to possess a &quot;d&quot;-wave pair symmetry. The first proposal that high-temperature cuprate superconductivity involves &quot;d&quot;-wave pairing was made in 1987 by N. E. Bickers, Douglas James Scalapino and R. T. Scalettar, followed by three subsequent theories in 1988 by Masahiko Inui, Sebastian Doniach, Peter J. Hirschfeld and Andrei E. Ruckenstein, using spin-fluctuation theory, and by Claudius Gros, Didier Poilblanc, Maurice T. Rice and FC. Zhang, and by Gabriel Kotliar and Jialin Liu identifying &quot;d&quot;-wave pairing as a natural consequence of the RVB theory. The confirmation of the &quot;d&quot;-wave nature of the cuprate superconductors was made by a variety of experiments, including the direct observation of the &quot;d&quot;-wave nodes in the excitation spectrum through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), the observation of a half-integer flux in tunneling experiments, and indirectly from the temperature dependence of the penetration depth, specific heat and thermal conductivity.

As of 2021, the superconductor with the highest transition temperature at ambient pressure is the cuprate of mercury, barium, and calcium, at around . There are other superconductors with higher recorded transition temperaturesfor example lanthanum superhydride at , but these only occur at very high pressures.

The origin of high-temperature superconductivity is still not clear, but it seems that instead of &quot;electron–phonon&quot; attraction mechanisms, as in conventional superconductivity, one is dealing with genuine &quot;electronic&quot; mechanisms (e.g. by antiferromagnetic correlations), and instead of conventional, purely s-wave pairing, more exotic pairing symmetries are thought to be involved (&quot;d&quot;-wave in the case of the cuprates; primarily extended &quot;s&quot;-wave, but occasionally &quot;d&quot;-wave, in the case of the iron-based superconductors).

In 2014, evidence showing that fractional particles can happen in quasi two-dimensional magnetic materials, was found by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) scientists lending support for Anderson&#x27;s theory of high-temperature superconductivity.

== Selected list of superconductors ==
== Properties ==
The &quot;high-temperature&quot; superconductor class has had many definitions.

The label high-c should be reserved for materials with critical temperatures greater than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. However, a number of materialsincluding the original discovery and recently discovered pnictide superconductorshave critical temperatures below but nonetheless are commonly referred to in publications as high-c class.

A substance with a critical temperature above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, together with a high critical magnetic field and critical current density (above which superconductivity is destroyed), would greatly benefit technological applications. In magnet applications, the high critical magnetic field may prove more valuable than the high c itself. Some cuprates have an upper critical field of about 100 tesla. However, cuprate materials are brittle ceramics that are expensive to manufacture and not easily turned into wires or other useful shapes. Furthermore, high-temperature superconductors do not form large, continuous superconducting domains, rather clusters of microdomains within which superconductivity occurs. They are therefore unsuitable for applications requiring actual superconductive currents, such as magnets for magnetic resonance spectrometers. For a solution to this (powders), see HTS wire.

There has been considerable debate regarding high-temperature superconductivity coexisting with magnetic ordering in YBCO, iron-based superconductors, several ruthenocuprates and other exotic superconductors, and the search continues for other families of materials. HTS are Type-II superconductors, which allow magnetic fields to penetrate their interior in quantized units of flux, meaning that much higher magnetic fields are required to suppress superconductivity. The layered structure also gives a directional dependence to the magnetic field response.

All known high-c superconductors are Type-II superconductors. In contrast to Type-I superconductors, which expel all magnetic fields due to the Meissner effect, Type-II superconductors allow magnetic fields to penetrate their interior in quantized units of flux, creating &quot;holes&quot; or &quot;tubes&quot; of normal metallic regions in the superconducting bulk called vortices. Consequently, high-c superconductors can sustain much higher magnetic fields.

=== Cuprates ===

Cuprates are layered materials, consisting of superconducting layers of copper oxide, separated by spacer layers.
Cuprates generally have a structure close to that of a two-dimensional material. Their superconducting properties are determined by electrons moving within weakly coupled copper-oxide (CuO2) layers. Neighbouring layers contain ions such as lanthanum, barium, strontium, or other atoms which act to stabilize the structures and dope electrons or holes onto the copper-oxide layers. The undoped &quot;parent&quot; or &quot;mother&quot; compounds are Mott insulators with long-range antiferromagnetic order at sufficiently low temperatures. Single band models are generally considered to be enough to describe the electronic properties.

The cuprate superconductors adopt a perovskite structure. The copper-oxide planes are checkerboard lattices with squares of O2− ions with a Cu2+ ion at the centre of each square. The unit cell is rotated by 45° from these squares. Chemical formulae of superconducting materials generally contain fractional numbers to describe the doping required for superconductivity. There are several families of cuprate superconductors and they can be categorized by the elements they contain and the number of adjacent copper-oxide layers in each superconducting block. For example, YBCO and BSCCO can alternatively be referred to as &quot;Y123&quot; and Bi2201/Bi2212/Bi2223 depending on the number of layers in each superconducting block (). The superconducting transition temperature has been found to peak at an optimal doping value (=0.16) and an optimal number of layers in each superconducting block, typically =3.

Possible mechanisms for superconductivity in the cuprates continue to be the subject of considerable debate and further research. Certain aspects common to all materials have been identified. Similarities between the antiferromagnetic the low-temperature state of undoped materials and the superconducting state that emerges upon doping, primarily the x2−y2 orbital state of the Cu2+ ions, suggest that electron–electron interactions are more significant than electron–phonon interactions in cupratesmaking the superconductivity unconventional. Recent work on the Fermi surface has shown that nesting occurs at four points in the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone where spin waves exist and that the superconducting energy gap is larger at these points. The weak isotope effects observed for most cuprates contrast with conventional superconductors that are well described by BCS theory.

Similarities and differences in the properties of hole-doped and electron doped cuprates:
* Presence of a pseudogap phase up to at least optimal doping.
* Different trends in the Uemura plot relating transition temperature to the superfluid density. The inverse square of the London penetration depth appears to be proportional to the critical temperature for a large number of underdoped cuprate superconductors, but the constant of proportionality is different for hole- and electron-doped cuprates. The linear trend implies that the physics of these materials is strongly two-dimensional.
* Universal hourglass-shaped feature in the spin excitations of cuprates measured using inelastic neutron diffraction.
* Nernst effect evident in both the superconducting and pseudogap phases.

The electronic structure of superconducting cuprates is highly anisotropic (see the crystal structure of YBCO or BSCCO). Therefore, the Fermi surface of HTSC is very close to the Fermi surface of the doped CuO2 plane (or multi-planes, in case of multi-layer cuprates) and can be presented on the 2‑D reciprocal space (or momentum space) of the CuO2 lattice. The typical Fermi surface within the first CuO2 Brillouin zone is sketched in Fig. 1 (left). It can be derived from the band structure calculations or measured by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Fig. 1 (right) shows the Fermi surface of BSCCO measured by ARPES. In a wide range of charge carrier concentration (doping level), in which the hole-doped HTSC are superconducting, the Fermi surface is hole-like (&quot;i.e.&quot; open, as shown in Fig. 1). This results in an inherent in-plane anisotropy of the electronic properties of HTSC. In 2018, the full three dimensional Fermi surface structure was derived from soft x-ray ARPES.

=== Iron-based ===

Iron-based superconductors contain layers of iron and a pnictogensuch as arsenic or phosphorus, a chalcogen, or a crystallogen. This is currently the family with the second highest critical temperature, behind the cuprates. Interest in their superconducting properties began in 2006 with the discovery of superconductivity in LaFePO at and gained much greater attention in 2008 after the analogous material LaFeAs(O,F) was found to superconduct at up to under pressure.
The highest critical temperatures in the iron-based superconductor family exist in thin films of FeSe, where a critical temperature in excess of was reported in 2014.

Since the original discoveries several families of iron-based superconductors have emerged:
* LnFeAs(O,F) or LnFeAsO1−x (Ln=lanthanide) with c up to , referred to as 1111 materials. A fluoride variant of these materials was subsequently found with similar c values.
* (Ba,K)Fe2As2 and related materials with pairs of iron-arsenide layers, referred to as 122 compounds. c values range up to . These materials also superconduct when iron is replaced with cobalt.
* LiFeAs and NaFeAs with c up to around . These materials superconduct close to stoichiometric composition and are referred to as 111 compounds.
* FeSe with small off-stoichiometry or tellurium doping.
* LaFeSiH with c around in its stoichiometric composition. This superconducting crystallogenide has oxide and fluoride variants LaFeSiOx and LaFeSiFx. 

Most undoped iron-based superconductors show a tetragonal-orthorhombic structural phase transition followed at lower temperature by magnetic ordering, similar to the cuprate superconductors. However, they are poor metals rather than Mott insulators and have five bands at the Fermi surface rather than one. 
The phase diagram emerging as the iron-arsenide layers are doped is remarkably similar, with the superconducting phase close to or overlapping the magnetic phase. Strong evidence that the c value varies with the As–Fe–As bond angles has already emerged and shows that the optimal c value is obtained with undistorted FeAs4 tetrahedra. The symmetry of the pairing wavefunction is still widely debated, but an extended &quot;s&quot;-wave scenario is currently favoured.

=== Magnesium diboride ===
Magnesium diboride is occasionally referred to as a high-temperature superconductor because its c value of is above that historically expected for BCS superconductors. However, it is more generally regarded as the highest c conventional superconductor, the increased c resulting from two separate bands being present at the Fermi level.

=== Carbon-based ===
In 1991 Hebard et al. discovered Fulleride superconductors, where alkali-metal atoms are intercalated into C60 molecules.

In 2008 Ganin et al. demonstrated superconductivity at temperatures of up to for Cs3C60.

P-doped Graphane was proposed in 2010 to be capable of sustaining high-temperature superconductivity.

On 31st of December 2023 &quot;Global Room-Temperature Superconductivity in Graphite&quot; was published in the journal &quot;Advanced Quantum Technologies&quot; claiming to demonstrate superconductivity at room temperature and ambient pressure in Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite with dense arrays of nearly parallel line defects.

=== Nickelates ===
In 1999, Anisimov et al. conjectured superconductivity in nickelates, proposing nickel oxides as direct analogs to the cuprate superconductors. Superconductivity in an infinite-layer nickelate, Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2, was reported at the end of 2019 with a superconducting transition temperature between . This superconducting phase is observed in oxygen-reduced thin films created by the pulsed laser deposition of Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 onto SrTiO3 substrates that is then reduced to Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 via annealing the thin films at in the presence of CaH2. The superconducting phase is only observed in the oxygen reduced film and is not seen in oxygen reduced bulk material of the same stoichiometry, suggesting that the strain induced by the oxygen reduction of the Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 thin film changes the phase space to allow for superconductivity.
Of important is further to extract access hydrogen from the reduction with CaH2, otherwise topotactic hydrogen may prevent superconductivity.
== Cuprates ==

The structure of cuprates which are superconductors are often closely related to perovskite structure, and the structure of these compounds has been described as a distorted, oxygen deficient multi-layered perovskite structure. One of the properties of the crystal structure of oxide superconductors is an alternating multi-layer of CuO2 planes with superconductivity taking place between these layers. The more layers of CuO2, the higher c. This structure causes a large anisotropy in normal conducting and superconducting properties, since electrical currents are carried by holes induced in the oxygen sites of the CuO2 sheets. The electrical conduction is highly anisotropic, with a much higher conductivity parallel to the CuO2 plane than in the perpendicular direction. Generally, critical temperatures depend on the chemical compositions, cations substitutions and oxygen content. They can be classified as superstripes; i.e., particular realizations of superlattices at atomic limit made of superconducting atomic layers, wires, dots separated by spacer layers, that gives multiband and multigap superconductivity.

=== Yttrium–barium cuprate ===

An yttrium–barium cuprate, YBa2Cu3O7−x (or Y123), was the first superconductor found above liquid nitrogen boiling point. There are two atoms of Barium for each atom of Yttrium.
The proportions of the three different metals in the YBa2Cu3O7 superconductor are in the mole ratio of 1 to 2 to 3 for yttrium to barium to copper, respectively: this particular superconductor has also often been referred to as the 123 superconductor.

The unit cell of YBa2Cu3O7 consists of three perovskite unit cells, which is pseudocubic, nearly orthorhombic. The other superconducting cuprates have another structure: they have a tetragonal cell.
Each perovskite cell contains a Y or Ba atom at the center: Ba in the bottom unit cell, Y in the middle one, and Ba in the top unit cell. Thus, Y and Ba are stacked in the sequence [Ba–Y–Ba] along the c-axis. All corner sites of the unit cell are occupied by Cu, which has two different coordinations, Cu(1) and Cu(2), with respect to oxygen. There are four possible crystallographic sites for oxygen: O(1), O(2), O(3) and O(4). The coordination polyhedra of Y and Ba with respect to oxygen are different. The tripling of the perovskite unit cell leads to nine oxygen atoms, whereas YBa2Cu3O7 has seven oxygen atoms and, therefore, is referred to as an oxygen-deficient perovskite structure. The structure has a stacking of different layers: (CuO)(BaO)(CuO2)(Y)(CuO2)(BaO)(CuO). One of the key feature of the unit cell of YBa2Cu3O7−x (YBCO) is the presence of two layers of CuO2. The role of the Y plane is to serve as a spacer between two CuO2 planes. In YBCO, the Cu–O chains are known to play an important role for superconductivity. c is maximal near when &quot;x&quot; ≈ 0.15 and the structure is orthorhombic. Superconductivity disappears at &quot;x&quot; ≈ 0.6, where the structural transformation of YBCO occurs from orthorhombic to tetragonal.

=== Other cuprates ===

The preparation of other cuprates is more difficult than the YBCO preparation.
They also have a different crystal structure: they are tetragonal where YBCO is orthorhombic.
Problems in these superconductors arise because of the existence of three or more phases having a similar layered structure. 
Moreover, the crystal structure of other tested cuprate superconductors are very similar. Like YBCO, the perovskite-type feature and the presence of simple copper oxide (CuO2) layers also exist in these superconductors. However, unlike YBCO, Cu–O chains are not present in these superconductors. The YBCO superconductor has an orthorhombic structure, whereas the other high-c superconductors have a tetragonal structure.

There are three main classes of superconducting cuprates: bismuth-based, thallium-based and mercury-based.

The second cuprate by practical importance is currently BSCCO, a compound of Bi–Sr–Ca–Cu–O. The content of bismuth and strontium creates some chemical issues. 
It has three superconducting phases forming a homologous series as Bi2Sr2Ca&quot;n&quot;−1Cu&quot;n&quot;O4+2&quot;n&quot;+&quot;x&quot; (&quot;n&quot;=1, 2 and 3). 
These three phases are Bi-2201, Bi-2212 and Bi-2223, having transition temperatures of , and , respectively, where the numbering system represent number of atoms for Bi Sr, Ca and Cu respectively. The two phases have a tetragonal structure which consists of two sheared crystallographic unit cells. The unit cell of these phases has double Bi–O planes which are stacked in a way that the Bi atom of one plane sits below the oxygen atom of the next consecutive plane. The Ca atom forms a layer within the interior of the CuO2 layers in both Bi-2212 and Bi-2223; there is no Ca layer in the Bi-2201 phase. The three phases differ with each other in the number of cuprate planes; Bi-2201, Bi-2212 and Bi-2223 phases have one, two and three CuO2 planes, respectively. The &quot;c&quot; axis lattice constants of these phases increases with the number of cuprate planes (see table below). The coordination of the Cu atom is different in the three phases. The Cu atom forms an octahedral coordination with respect to oxygen atoms in the 2201 phase, whereas in 2212, the Cu atom is surrounded by five oxygen atoms in a pyramidal arrangement. In the 2223 structure, Cu has two coordinations with respect to oxygen: one Cu atom is bonded with four oxygen atoms in square planar configuration and another Cu atom is coordinated with five oxygen atoms in a pyramidal arrangement.

Cuprate of Tl–Ba–Ca: The first series of the Tl-based superconductor containing one Tl–O layer has the general formula TlBa2Ca&quot;n&quot;−1Cu&quot;n&quot;O2&quot;n&quot;+3, whereas the second series containing two Tl–O layers has a formula of Tl2Ba2Ca&quot;n&quot;−1Cu&quot;n&quot;O2&quot;n&quot;+4 with &quot;n&quot; =1, 2 and 3. In the structure of Tl2Ba2CuO6 (Tl-2201), there is one CuO2 layer with the stacking sequence (Tl–O) (Tl–O) (Ba–O) (Cu–O) (Ba–O) (Tl–O) (Tl–O). In Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 (Tl-2212), there are two Cu–O layers with a Ca layer in between. Similar to the Tl2Ba2CuO6 structure, Tl–O layers are present outside the Ba–O layers. In Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 (Tl-2223), there are three CuO layers enclosing Ca layers between each of these. In Tl-based superconductors, c is found to increase with the increase in CuO2 layers. However, the value of c decreases after four CuO2 layers in TlBa2Ca&quot;n&quot;−1Cu&quot;n&quot;O2&quot;n&quot;+3, and in the Tl2Ba2Ca&quot;n&quot;−1Cu&quot;n&quot;O2&quot;n&quot;+4 compound, it decreases after three CuO2 layers.

Cuprate of Hg–Ba–Ca The crystal structure of HgBa2CuO4 (Hg-1201), HgBa2CaCu2O6 (Hg-1212) and HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8 (Hg-1223) is similar to that of Tl-1201, Tl-1212 and Tl-1223, with Hg in place of Tl. It is noteworthy that the c of the Hg compound (Hg-1201) containing one CuO2 layer is much larger as compared to the one-CuO2-layer compound of thallium (Tl-1201). In the Hg-based superconductor, c is also found to increase as the CuO2 layer increases. For Hg-1201, Hg-1212 and Hg-1223, the values of c are 94, 128, and the record value at ambient pressure , respectively, as shown in table below. The observation that the c of Hg-1223 increases to under high pressure indicates that the c of this compound is very sensitive to the structure of the compound.

=== Preparation and manufacturing ===
The simplest method for preparing ceramic superconductors is a solid-state thermochemical reaction involving mixing, calcination and sintering. 
The appropriate amounts of precursor powders, usually oxides and carbonates, are mixed thoroughly using a Ball mill. Solution chemistry processes such as coprecipitation, freeze-drying and sol–gel methods are alternative ways for preparing a homogeneous mixture. These powders are calcined in the temperature range from for several hours. The powders are cooled, reground and calcined again. This process is repeated several times to get homogeneous material. The powders are subsequently compacted to pellets and sintered. The sintering environment such as temperature, annealing time, atmosphere and cooling rate play a very important role in getting good high-c superconducting materials. The YBa2Cu3O7−&quot;x&quot; compound is prepared by calcination and sintering of a homogeneous mixture of Y2O3, BaCO3 and CuO in the appropriate atomic ratio. Calcination is done at , whereas sintering is done at in an oxygen atmosphere. The oxygen stoichiometry in this material is very crucial for obtaining a superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−&quot;x&quot; compound. At the time of sintering, the semiconducting tetragonal YBa2Cu3O6 compound is formed, which, on slow cooling in oxygen atmosphere, turns into superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−&quot;x&quot;. The uptake and loss of oxygen are reversible in YBa2Cu3O7&quot;−x&quot;. A fully oxygenated orthorhombic YBa2Cu3O7−&quot;x&quot; sample can be transformed into tetragonal YBa2Cu3O6 by heating in a vacuum at temperature above .

The preparation of Bi-, Tl- and Hg-based high-c superconductors is more difficult than the YBCO preparation. Problems in these superconductors arise because of the existence of three or more phases having a similar layered structure. Thus, syntactic intergrowth and defects such as stacking faults occur during synthesis and it becomes difficult to isolate a single superconducting phase. For Bi–Sr–Ca–Cu–O, it is relatively simple to prepare the Bi-2212 (c ≈ 85 K) phase, whereas it is very difficult to prepare a single phase of Bi-2223 (c ≈ 110 K). The Bi-2212 phase appears only after few hours of sintering at , but the larger fraction of the Bi-2223 phase is formed after a long reaction time of more than a week at . Although the substitution of Pb in the Bi–Sr–Ca–Cu–O compound has been found to promote the growth of the high-c phase, a long sintering time is still required.

== Ongoing research ==
The question of how superconductivity arises in high-temperature superconductors is one of the major unsolved problems of theoretical condensed matter physics. The mechanism that causes the electrons in these crystals to form pairs is not known. Despite intensive research and many promising leads, an explanation has so far eluded scientists. One reason for this is that the materials in question are generally very complex, multi-layered crystals (for example, BSCCO), making theoretical modelling difficult.

Improving the quality and variety of samples also gives rise to considerable research, both with the aim of improved characterisation of the physical properties of existing compounds, and synthesizing new materials, often with the hope of increasing c. Technological research focuses on making HTS materials in sufficient quantities to make their use economically viable as well as in optimizing their properties in relation to applications.
Metallic hydrogen has been proposed as a room-temperature superconductor, some experimental observations have detected the occurrence of the Meissner effect. LK-99, copper-doped lead-apatite, has also been proposed as a room-temperature superconductor.

== Theoretical models ==
There have been two representative theories for high-temperature or unconventional superconductivity. 
Firstly, weak coupling theory suggests superconductivity emerges from antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in a doped system. 
According to this theory, the pairing wave function of the cuprate HTS should have a &quot;d&quot;x2-y2 symmetry. Thus, determining whether the pairing wave function has &quot;d&quot;-wave symmetry is essential to test the spin fluctuation mechanism. That is, if the HTS order parameter (a pairing wave function like in Ginzburg–Landau theory) does not have &quot;d&quot;-wave symmetry, then a pairing mechanism related to spin fluctuations can be ruled out. (Similar arguments can be made for iron-based superconductors but the different material properties allow a different pairing symmetry.) Secondly, there was the interlayer coupling model, according to which a layered structure consisting of BCS-type (&quot;s&quot;-wave symmetry) superconductors can enhance the superconductivity by itself. By introducing an additional tunnelling interaction between each layer, this model successfully explained the anisotropic symmetry of the order parameter as well as the emergence of the HTS. Thus, in order to solve this unsettled problem, there have been numerous experiments such as photoemission spectroscopy, NMR, specific heat measurements, etc. Up to date the results were ambiguous, some reports supported the &quot;d&quot; symmetry for the HTS whereas others supported the &quot;s&quot; symmetry. This muddy situation possibly originated from the indirect nature of the experimental evidence, as well as experimental issues such as sample quality, impurity scattering, twinning, etc.

This summary makes an implicit assumption: superconductive properties can be treated by mean-field theory. It also fails to mention that in addition to the superconductive gap, there is a second gap, the pseudogap. The cuprate layers are insulating, and the superconductors are doped with interlayer impurities to make them metallic. The superconductive transition temperature can be maximized by varying the dopant concentration. The simplest example is La2CuO4, which consist of alternating CuO2 and LaO layers which are insulating when pure. When 8% of the La is replaced by Sr, the latter act as dopants, contributing holes to the CuO2 layers, and making the sample metallic. The Sr impurities also act as electronic bridges, enabling interlayer coupling. Proceeding from this picture, some theories argue that the basic pairing interaction is still interaction with phonons, as in the conventional superconductors with Cooper pairs. While the undoped materials are antiferromagnetic, even a few percent of impurity dopants introduce a smaller pseudogap in the CuO2 planes which is also caused by phonons. The gap decreases with increasing charge carriers, and as it nears the superconductive gap, the latter reaches its maximum. The reason for the high transition temperature is then argued to be due to the percolating behaviour of the carriersthe carriers follow zig-zag percolative paths, largely in metallic domains in the CuO2 planes, until blocked by charge density wave domain walls, where they use dopant bridges to cross over to a metallic domain of an adjacent CuO2 plane. The transition temperature maxima are reached when the host lattice has weak bond-bending forces, which produce strong electron–phonon interactions at the interlayer dopants.

=== D symmetry in YBCO ===
An experiment based on flux quantization of a three-grain ring of YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) was proposed to test the symmetry of the order parameter in the HTS. The symmetry of the order parameter could best be probed at the junction interface as the Cooper pairs tunnel across a Josephson junction or weak link. 
It was expected that a half-integer flux, that is, a spontaneous magnetization could only occur for a junction of &quot;d&quot; symmetry superconductors. But, even if the junction experiment is the strongest method to determine the symmetry of the HTS order parameter, the results have been ambiguous. John R. Kirtley and C. C. Tsuei thought that the ambiguous results came from the defects inside the HTS, so that they designed an experiment where both clean limit (no defects) and dirty limit (maximal defects) were considered simultaneously. In the experiment, the spontaneous magnetization was clearly observed in YBCO, which supported the &quot;d&quot; symmetry of the order parameter in YBCO. But, since YBCO is orthorhombic, it might inherently have an admixture of &quot;s&quot; symmetry. So, by tuning their technique further, they found that there was an admixture of &quot;s&quot; symmetry in YBCO within about 3%. Also, they found that there was a pure &quot;d&quot;x2−y2 order parameter symmetry in the tetragonal Tl2Ba2CuO6.

=== Spin-fluctuation mechanism ===
Despite all these years, the mechanism of high-c superconductivity is still highly controversial, mostly due to the lack of exact theoretical computations on such strongly interacting electron systems. However, most rigorous theoretical calculations, including phenomenological and diagrammatic approaches, converge on magnetic fluctuations as the pairing mechanism for these systems. The qualitative explanation is as follows:

In a superconductor, the flow of electrons cannot be resolved into individual electrons, but instead consists of many pairs of bound electrons, called Cooper pairs. In conventional superconductors, these pairs are formed when an electron moving through the material distorts the surrounding crystal lattice, which in turn attracts another electron and forms a bound pair. This is sometimes called the &quot;water bed&quot; effect. Each Cooper pair requires a certain minimum energy to be displaced, and if the thermal fluctuations in the crystal lattice are smaller than this energy the pair can flow without dissipating energy. This ability of the electrons to flow without resistance leads to superconductivity.

In a high-c superconductor, the mechanism is extremely similar to a conventional superconductor, except, in this case, phonons virtually play no role and their role is replaced by spin-density waves. Just as all known conventional superconductors are strong phonon systems, all known high-c superconductors are strong spin-density wave systems, within close vicinity of a magnetic transition to, for example, an antiferromagnet. When an electron moves in a high-c superconductor, its spin creates a spin-density wave around it. This spin-density wave in turn causes a nearby electron to fall into the spin depression created by the first electron (water-bed effect again). Hence, again, a Cooper pair is formed. When the system temperature is lowered, more spin density waves and Cooper pairs are created, eventually leading to superconductivity. Note that in high-c systems, as these systems are magnetic systems due to the Coulomb interaction, there is a strong Coulomb repulsion between electrons. This Coulomb repulsion prevents pairing of the Cooper pairs on the same lattice site. The pairing of the electrons occur at near-neighbor lattice sites as a result. This is the so-called &quot;d&quot;-wave pairing, where the pairing state has a node (zero) at the origin.

Examples of high-c cuprate superconductors include YBCO and BSCCO, which are the most known materials that achieve superconductivity above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen.

<doc id="101337" wikidata="Q722232" url="?curid=101337" title="Switchfoot">
<text>Switchfoot is an American rock band from San Diego, California. The band&#x27;s members are Jon Foreman (lead vocals, guitar), Tim Foreman (bass guitar, backing vocals), Chad Butler (drums, percussion), and Jerome Fontamillas (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals). Guitarist Drew Shirley was also a member of the band from 2005 to 2022. After early successes in the Christian rock scene, Switchfoot first gained mainstream recognition with the inclusion of four of their songs in the 2002 film &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;. This recognition led to the release of their major label debut &quot;The Beautiful Letdown&quot;, which was released in 2003 and featured the hit singles &quot;Meant to Live&quot; and &quot;Dare You to Move&quot;. Their fifth album, &quot;Nothing Is Sound&quot; peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and included the single &quot;Stars.&quot; Their seventh album, &quot;Hello Hurricane&quot; (2009) received a Grammy Award for Best Rock or Rap Gospel Album. They have been noted for their energetic live shows.

According to Jon Foreman, the name &quot;Switchfoot&quot; comes from a surfing term. &quot;We all love to surf and have been surfing all our lives so to us, the name made sense. To switch your feet means to take a new stance facing the opposite direction. It&#x27;s about change and movement, a different way of approaching life and music.&quot;

==History==
===Formation and early years (1996–2002)===
Switchfoot was founded in 1996 as Chin Up, consisting of Jon Foreman and his brother Tim along with Chad Butler on drums. After playing a few shows including the Foreman brothers&#x27; dad&#x27;s megachurch North Coast Calvary Chapel in Carlsbad, California, the band was contacted by music industry veteran Charlie Peacock and eventually signed to his indie label Re:think Records under the current moniker, Switchfoot. Re:think went on to distribute the first three Switchfoot albums, &quot;The Legend of Chin&quot;, &quot;New Way to Be Human&quot;, and &quot;Learning to Breathe&quot;. Because Re:think was bought by Christian giant Sparrow Records before Switchfoot&#x27;s first release, however, the band&#x27;s and Peacock&#x27;s intentions of being marketed outside of the Contemporary Christian music scene and reaching a wider audience were put on hold. Consequently, the band was mostly marketed to Christian radio and retail outlets early in their careers, a time Jon Foreman has described as when &quot;half of who we were was lost.&quot;

Of Switchfoot&#x27;s first three albums, &quot;Learning to Breathe&quot; was the most successful, receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Gospel Album.

Later in 2002, Switchfoot&#x27;s music was featured prominently in the movie &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;, starring singer and actress Mandy Moore, who sang Switchfoot&#x27;s song &quot;Only Hope&quot; during a scene in the movie. In addition to Moore&#x27;s cover of &quot;Only Hope&quot;, Switchfoot&#x27;s songs &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Learning to Breathe&quot;, and &quot;I Dare You to Move&quot; were showcased in the film, as well as their own original version of &quot;Only Hope&quot; towards the end of the film.

===&quot;The Beautiful Letdown&quot; (2003–2005)===

After the exposure which came from &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;, Switchfoot attracted attention from multiple record labels and eventually they signed with Columbia Records/SonyBMG. Their major label debut, &quot;The Beautiful Letdown&quot;, under Columbia Records/Red Ink, represented the band&#x27;s evolution from the predominantly lo-fi, indie rock sound of their early albums, toward a more layered, synth-influenced sound that helped launch the band to mainstream popularity. The shift sonically could be attributed to the fact that the album was the first to include keyboardist Jerome Fontamillas, formerly of industrial bands Mortal and Fold Zandura. Fontamillas had been touring with Switchfoot since 2000, following the release of &quot;Learning to Breathe&quot;.

&quot;The Beautiful Letdown&quot; has since been certified double platinum, selling more than 2.6 million copies behind constant touring and the huge mainstream radio hits &quot;Meant to Live&quot; and &quot;Dare You to Move&quot;. A live DVD depicting one of the band&#x27;s live concerts, &quot;Live in San Diego&quot;, went platinum as well and a third single, &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; was released to radio. In addition, the song &quot;Gone&quot; received major airplay on Christian radio stations as well.

After the runaway success of &quot;The Beautiful Letdown&quot;, a compilation titled &quot;The Early Years: 1997-2000&quot; was released, which featured Switchfoot&#x27;s first three indie albums released under Re:think records including the original artwork for all the albums. The collection has since been certified gold with total sales of over 500,000 copies.

Switchfoot also received five 2005 Dove Award nominations, and won four, including Artist of the year.

===&quot;Nothing Is Sound&quot; (2005–2006)===

In 2005, prior to the release of &quot;Nothing Is Sound&quot;, Switchfoot announced that guitarist Drew Shirley (previously the guitarist for All Together Separate) had joined as the band&#x27;s fifth member after touring with the band since 2003. &quot;Nothing Is Sound&quot; was released on September 13, 2005; with Shirley&#x27;s inclusion Switchfoot&#x27;s sound became even more densely layered and guitar-heavy, resulting in an album which was edgier and darker than any of their previous work. &quot;Stars&quot; was released as the first radio single to promote the album, and was a solid hit on mainstream and alternative rock radio stations. It was used in ads for HBO. &quot;We Are One Tonight&quot; was released as the second single in early 2006; it was also featured in ads for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.

The album debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, an all-time high for the band, while bassist Tim Foreman attracted headlines by speaking out against the copy-protection used by the label and providing fans with a detailed workaround on the band&#x27;s message board, which was quickly deleted by Sony. The copy-protection is known as Extended Copy Protection, which has been identified by leading anti-virus companies as being a trojan horse and a rootkit.

During the spring 2006 leg of the Nothing Is Sound Tour, the band introduced &quot;a video diary of life on the road&quot; in the form of free video podcasts available via iTunes and streaming online on YouTube. In addition to featuring snippets of upcoming songs and live performances, the videos gave fans an inside look at the more casual and humorous aspects of the band members&#x27; touring lives; it features footage of the band working on their follow-up to &quot;Nothing Is Sound&quot;.

===&quot;Oh! Gravity.&quot; (2006–2007)===

Switchfoot&#x27;s next album, &quot;Oh! Gravity.&quot;, was released on December 26, 2006, to considerable critical acclaim. It entered the Billboard chart at No. 18 and peaked at No. 1 on iTunes&#x27; Top Albums chart.

Before the release of the album, Switchfoot e-mailed a newsletter on June 2 which contained a free download of the song &quot;Daylight to Break&quot;, a statement from Foreman implying that the band wanted to have a new album out by the end of the year, as well as a thanks to their fans for helping keep the band together for ten years. The band tried to involve their fans in the creation of the album, setting up a webcam in their recording studio and running a contest for a chance to play the cowbell in the studio with the band.

Promoting the album the band first released the song, &quot;Dirty Second Hands&quot;, as a &quot;preview&quot; single via iTunes on September 26. The title track &quot;Oh! Gravity&quot; was also released to iTunes on October 21 and was sent to radio on October 31 as the lead single for the album, seeing limited success at alternative and modern rock radio. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Awakening&quot;, was released in early 2007. Although it had virtually no play on mainstream radio, the accompanying band-funded music video song received over one million hits on YouTube in less than three months. When &quot;Oh! Gravity&quot; was pre-ordered a 3-song EP called &quot;Oh! Switchfoot&quot; was included. The short CD included three songs: &quot;The Sound in My Mouth&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot;, and &quot;Oh! Gravity (Acoustic)&quot;.

===Major-label independence, ‘’The Best Yet’’ (2007–2008)===
Later on August 10, 2007, Jon Foreman revealed that the band had severed ties with Columbia Records in order to release music as an Indie band. “Neither party has any hard feelings,” he said of the split a few months later. “I think for us, the reason why we signed with Columbia was because of the people that were there. So it’s very understandable when all those people are gone, you don’t hold any real bad feelings or good feelings towards a company name. I think that’s part of the problem with the corporate entity as a whole is that there’s no true responsibility.” In October 2007, the band announced that they had created a new record label called lowercase people records, in order to better make a direct connection with their fans.

Jon Foreman began working on his own set of solo EPs (one named after each season of the year); the first of these was released on November 27, 2007, the last on June 10, 2008. “Your Love Is Strong” is the most well known from the string of releases. Each of his EPs contained six songs. At the end of the process, he released a sort of “best of” album called Limbs and Branches. Foreman wrote two additional songs for this called “Over the River” and “Broken from the Start”. Once all four EPs were released, they were re-released on vinyl in limited quantity. Foreman also began a side project with Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek which was originally called “The Real SeanJon” but later renamed “Fiction Family“.

With their new status as an independent band, Switchfoot embarked on their 2007 fall tour, playing shows with Relient K and Ruth. The tour, dubbed the “Appetite for Construction Tour“, was designed to benefit Habitat For Humanity with the bands donating one dollar per ticket sold to the cause. In addition, Foreman wrote the song “Rebuild“ with Matt Thiessen from Relient K, and released it as a way to raise additional money for Habitat. By the end of the tour, the bands had raised over $100,000 for Habitat for Humanity. With no new album to promote, the band continued touring for philanthropic causes, booking a short national tour in March through May (titled the Up In Arms Tour), partnering with and benefitting the organization To Write Love on Her Arms.

In March 2008, the band wrote and recorded a new song called “This Is Home“ for the film ‘’The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian‘’. The song was included on the film’s official soundtrack and an accompanying music video was also filmed, with footage from the film.

Later that year, Columbia Records/Sony Music released a Switchfoot greatest hits compilation album titled ‘’The Best Yet‘’, a sort of “final farewell from Sony.”

===“Hello Hurricane” and “Eastern Hymns for Western Shores” (2008–2010)===
Prior to the label split, Foreman had announced in a March 17, 2007 MySpace blog that Switchfoot had begun pre-production for a new album; he said that “the new SF record is underway.” On October 12, 2007, Foreman also announced that the band had begun construction of their own studio in their hometown of San Diego. The studio, named Spot X Studio, was completed in the spring of 2008, and the band began recording their follow-up to 2006’s “Oh! Gravity.”

In April, the band announced that instead of one studio album, they had actually been at work on 4 albums’ worth of material, and had decided at the time to release them one after another, starting with the first one on November 10, 2009, titled “Hello Hurricane”.

When “Hello Hurricane” was completed, the band began searching for “the right partners” to distribute the songs globally. On August 7, 2009, the band announced that lowercase people records was licensing the album to Atlantic Records, ensuring “these tunes are heard around the world.” As a promotion for the new release, the band took a hands-on approach with their lead single, “Mess of Me”; they hid copies of the single all across the world and encouraged fans to share it by finding the discs and making copies of their own to hide. Through this, the single spread all across the world in grassroots fashion in advance of a traditional radio release; the track hit the Top 15 of Modern Rock radio. That was followed by the release of “The Sound (John M. Perkins&#x27; Blues)”, which went on to become the band’s first Top 10 Modern Rock hit since “Dare You to Move”.

On December 1, 2010, it was announced that “Hello Hurricane” had been nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock or Rap Gospel Album. It won the Grammy on February 13, 2011.

Late in 2010, Switchfoot announced via newsletter, that they would be releasing an EP of songs that they wrote and recorded between “Nothing Is Sound” and “Oh! Gravity.” It was called “Eastern Hymns for Western Shores”. For a time the location of the masters of these tracks were unknown. Once found, Switchfoot announced that the EP would be available as part of their holiday fan pack which also included a Switchfoot calendar, poster, sweatshirt jacket, and limited edition post cards with one for each of the songs on the EP. In their newsletter the band described these songs as showing their “darker” side. The EP included five never before heard songs along with a different cut of the “Oh! Gravity.” song “Dirty Second Hands”.

===&quot;Vice Verses&quot; (2011–2012)===
Switchfoot&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Vice Verses&quot;, was released on September 27, 2011, and debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200. According to Butler, the core of the record rests thematically in the idea of the polarity of life. A release date of September 27, 2011, was announced on AllAccess, with &quot;Dark Horses&quot; hitting modern rock radio on July 20.

In an interview with CBN.com, bassist Tim Foreman calls &quot;Vice Verses&quot; a cousin to &quot;Hello Hurricane&quot;, not a sequel to their last album but related in some ways. Tim, speaking of his brother (Switchfoot&#x27;s lead singer, Jon) said, &quot;It features some of his best lyrical work,&quot; and said that he is happy with the musical component of the project as well. &quot;From the very beginning, we set goals, one of them being to make a very rhythmic record, a very soulful record, and a very hard-hitting record that really pushes the boundaries, the highs and the lows,&quot; he told CBN.com.

Switchfoot performed a song for the &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; soundtrack, released October 4, 2011, titled &quot;Out of Control&quot;. On Record Store Day 2012, Switchfoot released their latest EP record, &quot;Vice Re-Verses&quot;. The digital download of the EP was later released on May 1.

===&quot;Fading West&quot; album and film (2013–2015)===


In May 2013, Switchfoot was on tour and filming a movie, &quot;Fading West&quot;. The band&#x27;s guitarist Drew Shirley said that it was &quot;a surf documentary mixed with behind the scenes footage of the band&quot; and that &quot;the soundtrack will be released as a CD and it will be [their] next album&quot;. On September 17, 2013 Switchfoot released &quot;Fading West EP&quot; containing three songs from the full-length album. Two songs on the EP, &quot;Who We Are&quot; and &quot;Love Alone Is Worth the Fight&quot;, were released in different radio formats as the lead singles promoting the upcoming album. The &quot;Fading West&quot; film premiered during the Fading West Tour which started in September 2013, and was released digitally on December 10, 2013. Switchfoot&#x27;s ninth studio album, also titled &quot;Fading West&quot;, was released on January 14, 2014 through lowercase people and Atlantic Records.

In February 2014, in a YouTube Interview with &quot;Relevant&quot; magazine, Jon Foreman hinted that a new album was coming out in late 2014 or early 2015 which would mostly consist of the songs that were cut from the &quot;Fading West&quot; film. The album, an EP titled &quot;The Edge of the Earth&quot;, was released on September 9, 2014. Foreman also announced that he would be releasing between 30-50 new songs for his solo albums most likely during 2015.

Switchfoot toured in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands in May and June 2015.
In July and August 2015, Switchfoot toured with Needtobreathe, Drew Holcomb and the Neighbors, and Colony House during the second leg of the 2015 &quot;Tour De Compadres&quot; tour.

===&quot;Where the Light Shines Through&quot; and hiatus (2015–2017)===

In August 2015, it was reported that Switchfoot would be releasing their tenth studio album in 2016.
On April 29, 2016, Concord Music Group announced that the band had signed a worldwide recording and co-publishing deal with Vanguard Records imprint and Concord&#x27;s sister publishing unit, The Bicycle Music Company.
On May 12, 2016, Switchfoot announced that the album, titled &quot;Where the Light Shines Through&quot;, would be released on July 8, 2016. It was produced by Switchfoot and John Fields, with whom the band has worked on &quot;The Beautiful Letdown&quot;, &quot;Nothing Is Sound&quot; and &quot;Oh! Gravity&quot;.
The band supported the album with the Tour, featuring Relient K and traveled to over 70 cities from September 17, 2016 through February 2017.

On December 6, 2016, Switchfoot revealed through an email newsletter and on their website that the premiere of their new film, Live from Hollywood Palladium, would coincide with their 2017 Summer Getaway event.

In July 2017, the band took to the road touring with Lifehouse on the &quot;Looking for Summer&quot; tour where the band delivered 30+ shows across the U.S. and Canada. It was the first time that Lifehouse and Switchfoot had toured together. A new single, &quot;Shine Like Gold,&quot; by Lifehouse and Switchfoot was released to help those affected by Hurricane Harvey while on tour. 

On December 15, 2017, Switchfoot announced via their website and mailing list that, after returning home from their fall tour, they would be taking a hiatus &quot;for the foreseeable future&quot;. The band said in their announcement, &quot;For the first time in twenty years, we are taking an extended break.&quot;

===&quot;Native Tongue&quot; and &quot;Covers&quot; (2018–2021)===
On March 30, 2018, the band posted a clip on YouTube; they said that they had come out of their hiatus and were working on &quot;Project 11&quot;. They previewed a heavy metal version of &quot;Meant to Live&quot;, claiming it was their new sound. Two days later on April 1, it was revealed to be an April Fool&#x27;s Joke.

On August 9, 2018, the band&#x27;s song &quot;You Found Me&quot; was released as the single promoting the drama film &quot;&quot;. The soundtrack album for the film was released on September 14, 2018.

On October 19, 2018, Switchfoot announced the release of their eleventh album &quot;Native Tongue&quot; on January 18, 2019 through Fantasy Records. In support of the album, the band embarked on a 2019 concert tour of the United States, supported by Colony House and Tyson Motsenbocker. The first single &quot;Native Tongue&quot; and its music video were released in conjunction with the album announcement.

In spring 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Switchfoot started working on an EP titled &quot;Covers&quot;, containing the band&#x27;s take on songs by Frank Ocean, Vampire Weekend, The Chainsmokers, The Verve, Harry Styles, and Jon Bellion. It was released on June 19, 2020 via Fantasy Records. They also played a monthly livestream concert called the &quot;Fantastic Not Traveling Music Show&quot; during which they played a variety of song requests spanning their career.

In May 2023, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their album &quot;The Beautiful Letdown&quot;, the band released &quot;The Beautiful Letdown (Our Version)&quot; and went on a tour playing the entire album live.

In June 2024, the band hosted the 20th annual Bro-A, which featured a guest appearance of former lead guitarist Drew Shirley.

==Style and influences==
Since Switchfoot&#x27;s first release in 1997, the band&#x27;s sound has significantly changed. The style of the early albums with independent label re:think Records consisted primarily of guitar-driven alternative rock, hard rock with characteristics of a three-man lineup, though they also incorporated string arrangements with slower songs.

Switchfoot&#x27;s frontman and guitarist Jon Foreman cites his musical influences as U2, The Beatles, and Keith Green; he said that he admires the vocal &quot;strength and vulnerability&quot; of Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash. Guitarist Drew Shirley cites U2, Miles Davis, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Tommy Walker, Phil Keaggy, Michael Jackson, Dave Matthews Band, and the Brand New Heavies while bassist Tim Foreman pays tribute to Stevie Wonder. Chad Butler also cites Dave Grohl as an influence for &quot;The Beautiful Letdown&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;ve never fit in any of the genre boxes,&quot; says Jon Foreman. &quot;I think that diversity is our strength&quot;.

With regard to their lyrics, Foreman notes &quot;we try to make music for thinking people&quot;, which can be characterized by his allusions to the works of philosophers like Søren Kierkegaard and Augustine of Hippo in the songs &quot;Sooner or Later (Soren&#x27;s Song)&quot; and &quot;Something More (Augustine&#x27;s Confession)&quot; respectively. &quot;Meant to Live&quot;, the band&#x27;s runaway hit, was inspired by T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;, while &quot;Stars&quot;, the lead single off &quot;Nothing Is Sound&quot;, briefly &quot;looks at things from the Descartes perspective,&quot; according to Foreman.

==Switchfoot and Christian music==
Switchfoot is often referred to as a Christian rock band; even after having been signed to the mainstream Columbia Records from 2003 to 2007, Atlantic Records from 2008 to 2016, and currently, Vanguard Records, their albums are still distributed to Christian retail outlets through Sparrow Records/EMI CMG, their songs are featured on Christian radio and charts, they play at Christian festivals, and they are presented with Dove Awards. The band has always philosophically disagreed with this label; &quot;We&#x27;re Christian by faith, not genre,&quot; Tim Foreman explained to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 2003.

Says Jon Foreman, &quot;We&#x27;ve always been very open and honest about where the songs are coming from. For us, these songs are for everyone. Calling us &#x27;Christian rock&#x27; tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them, and that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re trying to do. Music has always opened my mind—and that&#x27;s what we want&quot;.

&quot;[Signing to Columbia was] a realization of something that we&#x27;d wanted to be from the beginning,&quot; Foreman explains. &quot;When we were signed to re:think Records [an indie label], the goal was to get the music out to everybody. [But] when Sparrow [a Christian label] bought re:think Records, it was evident that our music wasn&#x27;t going to be in the hands of everybody. As a Christian, I have a lot to say within the walls of the church. But also, as a Christian, I&#x27;ve got a lot to say just about life in general... So to be able to be on Columbia &quot;and&quot; on Sparrow felt like the realization of the two sides of what we had to say. It&#x27;s a dream come true to be able to have songs that are outside of the box.&quot;

After the release of &quot;The Beautiful Letdown&quot;, the band temporarily stopped playing at Christian festivals and doing interviews with Christian organizations, as they found the speculation about their faith to be distracting from the music. Three years later, they went back to headlining at large Christian-based music festivals, and also agreed to be featured on the June 2006 cover of &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; after declining the opportunity for years. Yet in many ways they used the opportunity to describe their split from the CCM industry. That caused some, such as &quot;Spin&quot; writer Andrew Beaujon to say &quot;their lyrics often have two different meanings, one meaning for a Christian audience and one meaning for the rest of us. They try to relate to two different groups of people at once.&quot; Jon Foreman has compared the Christian undertones of his music to the undertones of C. S. Lewis&#x27; books.

==Other projects==

Switchfoot has been involved in a number of humanitarian causes including with DATA, the ONE Campaign, the Keep A Breast Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, Invisible Children, and To Write Love on Her Arms.

In addition to supporting those causes, they founded the Switchfoot Bro-Am Surf Contest, an annual benefit contest and concert to raise money for various organizations serving homeless kids in the band&#x27;s hometown of San Diego. Before recording &quot;Nothing Is Sound&quot;, the band made a trip to several South African villages in January 2005, which inspired the album&#x27;s song &quot;The Shadow Proves the Sunshine&quot;. Seeing an orphanage filled with infants who all lost their parents to AIDS, befriending orphans in the streets, and getting involved with a children&#x27;s choir called the &quot;Kuyasa Kids&quot; moved them to start an organization called lowercase people. The organization originally published a quarterly online magazine for music, arts and social justice. They have also produced a CD by the Kuyasa Kids to help raise money for the children&#x27;s communities.

In 2008, Switchfoot also got involved in the musical movement to spread awareness about 21st century slavery and human trafficking, performing &quot;Awakening&quot; for the documentary film &quot;Call + Response&quot;. Jon Foreman has released several solo projects, and is also involved in an acoustic collaboration called Fiction Family with Sean Watkins of the band Nickel Creek.

On Saturday, July 31, 2010, Switchfoot performed live at the 2010 Boy Scouts of America National Jamboree final arena show: &quot;A Shining Light Across America&quot; in Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. Jon and Tim Foreman were both Boy Scouts in their youth, and were honored by the opportunity to perform at the Scouts&#x27; 100th anniversary event. The band performed at the Harvest America event on March 6, 2016 at ATT Stadium .

Switchfoot hosts a yearly charity event in their hometown of San Diego known as the &quot;Bro Am&quot;. Established in 2005, the event benefits local and national charitable organizations, including the band&#x27;s own Bro Am foundation. The Bro Am festivities typically include a silent auction the night before the public event, wherein donors bid in a silent auction for charity. The Bro Am event consists of surf contests in the morning and musical performances in the afternoon, culminating in Switchfoot&#x27;s capstone performance. Since its inception, the Bro Am has raised over $1 million for charitable causes.

In 2017, Switchfoot joined forces with the fellow rock band Lifehouse, to help raise funds for Hurricane Harvey victims through their song &quot;Shine Like Gold&quot;.

<doc id="101339" wikidata="Q3566872" url="?curid=101339" title="Wayne Williams">
<text>Wayne Bertram Williams (born May 27, 1958) is an American convicted murderer and suspected serial killer who is serving life imprisonment for the 1981 killings of two men in Atlanta, Georgia. Although never tried for the additional murders, he is also believed to be responsible for at least 24 of the 30 Atlanta murders of 1979–1981, also known as the Atlanta Child Murders.

==Early life and education==
Wayne Williams, son of Homer and Faye Williams, was born on May 27, 1958, and raised in the Dixie Hills neighborhood of southwest Atlanta, Georgia. Both of his parents were teachers. Williams graduated from Douglass High School and developed a keen interest in radio and journalism. He constructed his own carrier current radio station and began frequenting stations WIGO and WAOK, where he befriended a number of the announcing crew and began dabbling in becoming a pop music producer and manager.

==Atlanta murders==
Williams first became a suspect in the Atlanta murders on the morning of May 22, 1981, when a police surveillance team, watching the James Jackson Parkway Bridge spanning the Chattahoochee River (a spot where multiple bodies had been discovered previously), heard a &quot;big loud splash&quot;, suggesting that something had been thrown from the bridge into the river below. The first automobile to exit the bridge after the splash, at roughly 2:50 a.m., belonged to Williams. When stopped and questioned, he told police that he was on his way to check on an address in a neighboring town ahead of an audition the following morning with a young singer named Cheryl Johnson. However, both the phone number he gave police and Cheryl Johnson turned out to be fictitious.

Two days later, on May 24, the nude body of 27-year-old Nathaniel Cater, who had been missing for four days and was last seen with Williams, was discovered in the river. The medical examiner ruled he had died of probable asphyxia but never specifically said he had been strangled. Police thought that Williams had killed Cater and that his body was the source of the sound they heard as his car crossed the bridge.

The results for all three of Williams’ polygraph tests were inconclusive. Hairs and fibers retrieved from the body of another victim, Jimmy Ray Payne, were found to be consistent with those from his home, car, and dog. Co-workers told police they had seen Williams with scratches on his face and arms around the time of the murders which, investigators surmised, could have been inflicted by victims during struggles. Williams held a press conference outside his home to proclaim his innocence, volunteering that he had taken three polygraph tests and all were inconclusive, in any event they would have been inadmissible in court.

Williams was questioned again by police for 12 hours on June 3 and 4 at FBI headquarters and released without arrest or charge, but remained under surveillance.

==Arrest and trial==
Williams was arrested on June 21, 1981, for the murders of Cater and Payne. His trial began on January 6, 1982, in Fulton County. During the two-month trial, prosecutors matched to a number of victims 19 sources of fibers from Williams&#x27;s home and car: his bedspread, bathroom, gloves, clothes, carpets, dog, and an unusual trilobal carpet fiber. Other evidence included witness testimony that placed Williams with several victims while they were alive, and inconsistencies in his accounts of his whereabouts. Williams had also lied about when the carpet was installed in his home, claiming it was installed in 1968 (which would undermine the testimony of prosecution experts, who said it was a rare type not manufactured until the 1970s) only for it to be discovered that the company that manufactured the carpet did not even exist until 1971. Williams took the stand in his own defense but alienated the jury by becoming angry and combative. After 12 hours of deliberation, the jury found him guilty on February 27 of the murders of Cater and Payne. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. After Williams became a suspect, the killings stopped.

In the late 1990s, Williams filed a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition and requested a retrial. Butts County Superior Court judge Hal Craig denied his appeal. Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker said that &quot;although this does not end the appeal process, I am pleased with the results in the habeas case&quot; and that his office will &quot;continue to do everything possible to uphold the conviction.&quot; In early 2004, Williams sought a retrial again, with his attorneys arguing that law enforcement officials covered up evidence of involvement by the Ku Klux Klan, and that carpet fibers purportedly linking him to the crimes would not stand up to scientific scrutiny. A federal judge rejected the request for retrial on October 17, 2006.

==Aftermath==
Williams was never tried for any of the Atlanta Child Murders. However, police attributed 22 other deaths, including those of 18 minors, to Williams.

Williams is serving his sentence at Telfair State Prison. On November 20, 2019, Williams was again denied parole. He will next be eligible for parole in November 2027.

==Reopening investigations==
Williams has maintained his innocence from the beginning and claimed that Atlanta officials covered up evidence of KKK involvement in the killings to avoid a race war in the city. His lawyers have said the conviction was a &quot;profound miscarriage of justice&quot; that has kept an innocent man incarcerated for the majority of his adult life and allowed the real killers to go free. In contrast, Joseph Drolet, who prosecuted Williams at trial, has stood by Williams&#x27;s convictions. He has emphasized that, after Williams was arrested, &quot;the murders stopped and there has been nothing since.&quot;

Other observers have criticized the thoroughness of the investigation and the validity of its conclusions. The author James Baldwin, in his essay &quot;The Evidence of Things Not Seen&quot; (1985), raised questions about Williams&#x27; guilt. Members of his community and several of the victims&#x27; parents did not believe that Williams, the son of two professional teachers, could have killed so many.

On May 6, 2005, DeKalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ordered the reopening of the murder cases of four boys killed in that county between February and May 1981, whose deaths had been attributed to Williams. The announcement was welcomed by relatives of some victims, who said they believe the wrong man was blamed for many of the murders.

Graham, who was serving as an assistant police chief in neighboring Fulton County at the time of the murders, said his decision to reopen the cases was driven solely by his belief in Williams&#x27;s innocence. Former DeKalb County Sheriff and convicted murderer Sidney Dorsey, who was an Atlanta homicide detective at the time, also said he believed Williams was wrongly blamed for the murders. &quot;If they arrested a white guy,&quot; he said, &quot;there would have been riots across the U.S..&quot; Dorsey is now serving a life sentence after being convicted of ordering the murder of his election opponent Derwin Brown. 

Fulton County authorities have not reopened any of the cases under their jurisdiction.

According to an August 2005 report, Charles T. Sanders, a white supremacist affiliated with the KKK and an early suspect in the murders, once praised the crimes in secretly recorded conversations. Although Sanders did not publicly claim responsibility for any of the deaths, he told an informant for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation in a 1981 recording that the killer had &quot;wiped out a thousand future generations of niggers&quot;. An anonymous alleged former friend of Sanders told documentarian Payne Lindsey (&quot;Atlanta Monster&quot;) that Sanders had taken credit for the murders mentioned in a 1986 &quot;Spin&quot; article, claiming that his brothers were also involved.

Sanders did not directly implicate the KKK or lead his friend to believe that anyone else from the organization was involved. Sanders allegedly mused over how lucky he was that he and Williams had the same carpet and that they both owned a white German shepherd. The anonymous former friend went on to say that, &quot;Once it was pinned on Wayne Williams, they were through. That was their way out.&quot; Police dropped the probe into possible Klan involvement when Sanders and two of his brothers passed lie detector tests in which they denied their involvement. The case was once again closed on July 21, 2006.

Former FBI profiler John E. Douglas wrote in his book &quot;&quot; that, in his opinion, &quot;forensic and behavioral evidence points conclusively to Wayne Williams as the killer of eleven young men in Atlanta.&quot; He added, however, that he believed there was &quot;no strong evidence linking him to all or even most of the deaths and disappearances of children in that city between 1979 and 1981&quot;.

In 2007, the FBI performed DNA tests on two human hairs found on one of the victims. The mitochondrial DNA sequence in the hairs would eliminate 99.5% of people, and 98% of African-Americans, by not matching their DNA; the sequence found matched Williams&#x27;s DNA.

DNA testing was performed in 2010 on scalp hairs found on the body of 11-year-old victim Patrick Baltazar. While the results were not firmly conclusive, the DNA sequence found appears in only 29 of 1,148 African-American hair samples in the FBI&#x27;s database, including that of Williams. The Baltazar case was included among 10 additional victims presented to the jury at Williams&#x27; trial, although he was never charged in any of those cases.

Dog hairs found on Baltazar&#x27;s body were tested in 2007 by the genetics laboratory at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, which found a DNA sequence also present in the Williams family&#x27;s German Shepherd. However, the director of the laboratory, Elizabeth Wictum, said that, while the results were &quot;fairly significant&quot;, they were not conclusive. Only mitochondrial DNA was tested; unlike nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA cannot be shown to be unique to an individual dog. The report said the hairs on the bodies contained the same DNA sequence as Williams&#x27;s dog, a DNA sequence that occurs in about 1 in 100 dogs. The FBI report stated that &quot;Wayne Williams cannot be excluded&quot; as a suspect in the case.

A Department of Justice study, released in April 2015, concluded that numerous hair analyses conducted by FBI examiners during the 1980s and 1990s &quot;may have failed to meet professional standards.&quot; Defense attorney Lynn Whatley immediately announced that the report would form the basis for a new appeal, but prosecutors responded that hair evidence played only a minor role in Williams&#x27;s conviction.

On March 21, 2019, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields announced that officials would re-test evidence from the murders, which will be gathered by the Atlanta Police Department, Fulton County District Attorney&#x27;s Office, and Georgia Bureau of Investigation. In a news conference, Bottoms said, &quot;It may be there is nothing left to be tested. But I do think history will judge us by our actions, and we will be able to say we tried.&quot;

In 2019, two Atlanta men, Derwin Davis and Isaac Rogers, claimed that Williams had attempted to abduct them in 1979 and 1981 respectively.

==Media==
Williams appears as the main antagonist in several media portrayals of the case. He was first depicted in the 1985 television miniseries &quot;The Atlanta Child Murders&quot; and was played by Calvin Levels. In 2000, Showtime released a drama film titled &quot;Who Killed Atlanta&#x27;s Children?&quot; with Clé Bennett playing Williams. In 2018, Williams and the Atlanta Child Murders were the subject of the true crime podcast &quot;Atlanta Monster&quot;, hosted by Payne Lindsey and co-produced by Tenderfoot TV and HowStuffWorks. In 2019, Williams was featured in season 2 of the Netflix series &quot;Mindhunter&quot; alongside others such as Charles Manson and David Berkowitz; Williams was portrayed by Christopher Livingston.

Tayari Jones&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;Leaving Atlanta&quot;, which portrays a fictionalised version of the Atlanta child murders, features a man heavily implied to be Williams at the end of the second chapter, &quot;The Opposite Direction of Home&quot;. Williams is shown picking up Rodney Green, a black teenager who has run away from home, after showing him a fake police badge; in the next chapter, &quot;Sweet Pea&quot;, Rodney is said to have become the killer&#x27;s latest victim.

The 2006 song &quot;Wrong Man&quot; by British rock band Deep Purple was written by singer Ian Gillan from Williams&#x27; perspective, and the concept of false imprisonment.

<text>Karen Ann Quinlan (March 29, 1954 – June 11, 1985) was an American woman who became an important figure in the history of the right to die controversy in the United States.

When she was 21, Quinlan became unconscious after she consumed Valium along with alcohol while on a crash diet and lapsed into a coma, followed by a persistent vegetative state. After doctors refused the request of her parents (Joseph and Julia Quinlan) to disconnect Karen&#x27;s ventilator, her parents filed suit to get her disconnected. The parents believed that her still being connected constituted extraordinary means of prolonging her life.

Eventually a court ruled that the ventilator could be withdrawn. However, she continued to breathe on her own. She survived another nine years in a persistent vegetative state. 

Quinlan&#x27;s case continues to raise important questions in moral theology, bioethics, euthanasia, legal guardianship and civil rights. Her case has affected the practice of medicine and law around the world. A significant outcome of her case was the development of formal ethics committees in hospitals, nursing homes and hospices.

==Early life, collapse, and coma==
Quinlan was born on March 29, 1954, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to a young woman of Irish American ancestry. A few weeks later, she was adopted by Joseph and Julia Quinlan, devout Roman Catholics who lived in the Landing section of Roxbury Township, New Jersey. Julia and Joseph also had daughter Mary Ellen in 1956 and son John in 1957. Quinlan attended Morris Catholic High School in Denville, New Jersey. After graduation, she worked at the Mykroy Ceramics Corporation in Ledgewood, New Jersey, from 1972 to 1974, and worked several jobs over the next year. Quinlan was a singer, and her parents characterized her as a tomboy. In April 1975, shortly after she turned 21, Quinlan left her parents&#x27; home and moved with two roommates into a house a few miles away in Byram Township, New Jersey. Around the same time, she went on a radical diet, reportedly to fit into a dress that she had bought.

On April 15, 1975, a few days after moving into her new house, Quinlan attended a friend&#x27;s birthday party at a local bar, then known as Falconer&#x27;s Lackawanna Inn, on Lake Lackawanna in Byram. She had eaten almost nothing for two days. At the party, she reportedly drank several gin and tonics and took Valium. Shortly afterwards, she felt faint and was quickly taken home and put to bed. When friends checked on her about 15 minutes later, they found that she was not breathing. An ambulance was called, and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was attempted. Eventually, some color returned to her pallid skin, but she did not regain consciousness. Quinlan was admitted in a coma to Newton Memorial Hospital in Newton, New Jersey. She remained there for nine days in an unresponsive condition before she was transferred to Saint Clare&#x27;s Hospital, a larger facility in Denville. Quinlan weighed when admitted to the hospital.

Quinlan had suffered irreversible brain damage after she had experienced an extended period of respiratory failure, lasting no more than 15–20 minutes. No precise cause of her respiratory failure has been given. Her brain was damaged to the extent that she entered a persistent vegetative state. Her eyes were &quot;disconjugate&quot; (they no longer moved in the same direction together). Her EEG showed only abnormal slow-wave activity. Over the next few months, she remained in the hospital and her condition gradually deteriorated. She lost weight and eventually weighed less than . She was prone to unpredictable, violent thrashing of her limbs. She was given nasogastric feeding and a ventilator to help her breathe.

==Legal battle==
Quinlan&#x27;s parents, Joseph Quinlan and Julia Quinlan, requested that she be disconnected from her ventilator, which they believed constituted extraordinary means of prolonging her life because it caused her pain. Hospital officials, faced with threats from the Morris County, New Jersey prosecutor of homicide charges being brought against them if they complied with the parents&#x27; request, joined with the Quinlan family in seeking an appropriate protective order from the courts before it would allow the ventilator to be removed.

===Suit and appeal===
The Quinlans filed a suit on September 12, 1975, to request the extraordinary means prolonging Karen Ann Quinlan&#x27;s life to be terminated. The Quinlans&#x27; lawyers argued that the parents’ right to make a private decision about their daughter&#x27;s fate superseded the state&#x27;s right to keep her alive, and her court-appointed guardian argued that disconnecting her ventilators would be homicide. The request was denied by New Jersey Superior Court Judge Robert Muir Jr. in November 1975. He cited that Quinlan&#x27;s doctors did not support removing her from the ventilator; whether or not to do so was a medical, rather than a judicial, decision; and doing so would violate New Jersey homicide statutes.

The Quinlans&#x27; attorneys, Paul W. Armstrong and James M. Crowley, appealed the decision to the New Jersey Supreme Court. On March 31, 1976, the court granted their request, holding that the right to privacy was broad enough to encompass the Quinlans&#x27; request on Quinlan&#x27;s behalf.

When Quinlan was removed from her ventilator in May 1976, she surprised many by continuing to breathe unaided. Her parents never sought to have her feeding tube removed. &quot;We never asked to have her die. We just asked to have her put back in a natural state so she could die in God&#x27;s time,&quot; Julia Quinlan said. She was moved to a nursing home. Quinlan was fed by artificial nutrition for nine more years until her death from respiratory failure on June 11, 1985.

===Extraordinary means===
Catholic moral theology does not require that &quot;extraordinary means&quot; be employed to preserve a patient&#x27;s life. Such means are any procedure that might place an undue burden on the patient, family, or others and would not result in reasonable hope of benefiting the patient. A person, or a person&#x27;s representative in cases where a person is not able to decide themselves, can refuse extraordinary means of treatment even if that will hasten natural death, and it is considered ethical.

It is to that principle that Quinlan&#x27;s parents appealed when they requested that the extraordinary means of a ventilator be removed, citing a declaration by Pope Pius XII from 1957.

==Life after the court decision, death, and legacy==
After her parents disconnected her ventilator, in May 1976, following the successful appeal, Quinlan&#x27;s parents continued to allow Quinlan to be fed with a feeding tube. Since that did not cause Quinlan pain, her parents did not consider it extraordinary means. Quinlan continued in a persistent vegetative state for slightly more than nine years, until her death from respiratory failure as a result of complications from pneumonia on June 11, 1985, in Morris Plains, New Jersey. Upon learning that Quinlan was expected to die, her parents requested that no extraordinary means be used to revive her. Quinlan weighed 65 lb (29 kg) at the time of her death. Quinlan was buried at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in East Hanover, New Jersey.

===Hospice===
Joseph and Julia Quinlan opened a hospice and memorial foundation in 1980 to honor their daughter&#x27;s memory. Her court case is linked to legal changes and hospital practices involving the right to refuse extraordinary means of treatment, even if cessation of treatment could end a life.

===Autopsy findings===
When Quinlan was alive, the extent of damage to her brain stem could not be precisely determined. After she died, her entire brain and spinal cord were studied carefully. While her cerebral cortex had moderate scarring, it seemed that her thalamus was extensively damaged bilaterally. Her brain stem, which controls breathing and cardiac functions, was undamaged. The findings suggest that the thalamus plays a particularly important role in consciousness.

==In popular culture==
The Quinlans published two books about the case: &quot;Karen Ann: The Quinlans Tell Their Story&quot; (1977) and &quot;My Joy, My Sorrow: Karen Ann&#x27;s Mother Remembers&quot; (2005).
In 1976 The band Starz (formerly Looking Glass) wrote a song &quot;Pull the Plug&quot; from their 1st studio album, &quot;Starz&quot;, that paralleled Quinlan&#x27;s story.
The 1977 TV movie &quot;In the Matter of Karen Ann Quinlan&quot; was made about the Quinlan case, with Piper Laurie and Brian Keith playing Quinlan&#x27;s parents.

The title character of Douglas Coupland&#x27;s novel &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot; is Karen Ann McNeil. She collapses after a party where she has taken Valium as well as some alcohol. Like Quinlan, she has deliberately stopped eating in order to fit into an outfit (in this case, a bikini). For these reasons (and the frequent nostalgic references to events from the 1970s in Coupland&#x27;s works), the character is thought to be based on Quinlan.

Donna Levin’s novel &quot;Extraordinary Means&quot; is a literary fantasy in which a young woman, although diagnosed in an irreversible coma, also brought on by an accidental combination of drugs and alcohol, is able to observe her family members debate over whether or not to withdraw life support.

<text>Theodor Escherich (; 29 November 1857 – 15 February 1911) was a German-Austrian pediatrician and a professor at universities in Graz and Vienna. He discovered and described the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

==Life and achievements==

=== Family and education ===
Theodor Escherich was born in Ansbach, as the younger son of &quot;Kreismedizinalrat&quot; (District Medical Officer) Ferdinand Escherich (1810−1888), a medical statistician, and his second wife, Maria Sophie Frederike von Stromer, daughter of a Bavarian army colonel. When Theodor Escherich was five, his mother died, and five years later Ferdinand Escherich moved to Würzburg to take up his former position as &quot;Kreismedizinalrat&quot; and married his third wife. When Theodor was 12, he was sent to a boarding school run by Jesuits in Feldkirch, Austria for three years. Later, he finished secondary education in Würzburg, where he attended a &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (classical language high school) and took his &quot;Abitur&quot; examination in 1876.

After a half-year military service in Strasbourg, Escherich took up his studies of medicine at the University of Würzburg in the winter term of 1876. Later, he attended the universities of Kiel and Berlin, and returned to Würzburg before passing his medical examination with excellence in December 1881.

===Medical career in Würzburg and Munich (1882−1890)===
After an 18-month service in a military hospital in Munich, Escherich returned to Würzburg in 1882 to become second and later first assistant to the internist Carl Jakob Adolf Christian Gerhardt in the medical clinic of the Julius Hospital, Würzburg. Gerhardt became Escherich&#x27;s doctoral advisor and suggested the topic of his thesis. On 27 October 1882, Escherich was awarded his medical doctorate. In the following two years, he attended lectures in Vienna (with Hermann von Widerhofer and Alois Monti) and did bacteriological research work at the St Anna Children&#x27;s Clinic. In August 1884, he continued his research work in Munich, where pediatrics had been established as a department of the medical faculty. In October 1884, the Bavarian authorities sent Escherich to Naples to do research work in the actual cholera epidemic. He also travelled to Paris, where he heard lectures by Jean-Martin Charcot, the renowned neurologist.

===Discovery of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;===

In 1886, after intensive laboratory investigations, Escherich published a monograph on the relationship of intestinal bacteria to the physiology of digestion in the infant. This work, presented to the medical faculty in Munich and published in Stuttgart, (1886) (&quot;Enterobacteria of infants and their relation to digestion physiology&quot;), was to become his habilitation treatise and established him as the leading bacteriologist in the field of paediatrics.&lt;br&gt;
It was also the publication where Escherich described a bacterium which he called “bacterium coli commune” and which was later to be called &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. For the next four years, Escherich worked as first assistant to Heinrich von Ranke at the Munich &quot;Von Haunersche Kinderklinik&quot;.

===Professor of Pediatrics in Graz and Vienna (1890−1911)===
In 1890, Escherich succeeded Rudolf von Jaksch, who had been called to Prague, as professor extraordinary of pediatrics and director of the St Anna children’s clinic in Graz, where he became professor ordinary four years later. While working in Graz, he married Margarethe Pfaundler (1890−1946), daughter of the physicist Leopold Pfaundler. They had a son Leopold (born 1893), who died at age ten, and a daughter Charlotte (called &quot;Sonny&quot;) (born 1895), who survived to the 1980s. &lt;br&gt; Escherich made the Graz pediatric hospital one of the best-known institutions in Europe. 

In 1902, Escherich succeeded Hermann Widerhofer as full professor of pediatrics in Vienna, where he directed the (St. Anna Children&#x27;s Hospital).

Escherich became renowned in 1903 when he founded the (Infant Defence Society) and started a high-profile campaign for breastfeeding. He died in Vienna in 1911.

<text>The national flag of [[Slovenia]] () features three equal horizontal bands of white (top), blue, and red, with the coat of arms of Slovenia located in the upper hoist side of the flag centred in the white and blue bands. The coat of arms is a shield with the image of Mount Triglav, Slovenia&#x27;s highest peak, in white against a blue background at the centre; beneath it are two wavy blue lines representing the Adriatic Sea and local rivers, and above it are three six-pointed golden stars arranged in an inverted triangle which are taken from the coat of arms of the Counts of Celje, the great Slovene dynastic house of the late 14th and early 15th centuries.

The flag&#x27;s colours are considered to be pan-Slavic, but they actually come from the medieval coat of arms of the Duchy of Carniola, consisting of 3 stars, a mountain, and three colours (red, blue, yellow), crescent. The existing Slovene tricolour was raised for the first time in history during the Revolution of 1848 by the Slovene Romantic nationalist activist and poet Lovro Toman on 7 April 1848, in Ljubljana, in response to a German flag which was raised on top of Ljubljana Castle. Similar colors and designs make up other Slavic flags, particularly the flag of Slovakia.

The civil and state ensign for ships has the same design as the national flag, but a different shape (2:3 instead of 1:2). Boats up to use the national flag as an ensign. The naval jack uses colours of the coat of arms, a white, blue, and yellow horizontal tricolour.

==Historical development==
===Origins===

The white-blue-red Slovene flag was first raised on 7 April 1848, on a building between Congress Square and Prešeren Square in Ljubljana, by a group of nationally minded students led by the prominent liberal nationalist activist and poet Lovro Toman. Despite opposition from the local ethnic Germans it was subsequently recognized by the Austrian Government as the official flag of Carniola. This formal recognition, albeit on a regional level, was an exception to the policy of the Austrian Government which tended to persecute national symbols of the non-German nationalities in the Empire.

In addition, Austrian authorities saw all tricolors as basically nationalist and potentially revolutionary symbols, so Austrian provinces (as the Empire itself) were only allowed to use bicolors (the only exception being the flag of the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia, since it was interpreted to be a combination of the Croatian and Slavonian bicolors). So the official recognition of the Carniolan white-blue-red tricolor instead of the traditional white-blue bicolor was seen as a major achievement by the Slovenes and it quickly became the symbol representing the idea of United Slovenia. In the second half of the 19th century, the Slovene national tricolor became the only truly all-Slovene symbol, representing all Slovenes, regardless of the historical region in which they lived.

The tricolor flag continued to be associated with Slovenia during the country&#x27;s incorporation into Yugoslavia, although officially the whole kingdom including Slovenia had the same flag, in this case, the blue-white-red. In the interwar period, it was also used by the Slovenes of the Julian March that were annexed to Italy, where it was prohibited and persecuted by the fascist regime.

===Slovene flags during and after WWII===
During World War II The Slovene national colors were used both by the Partisan Resistance Movement (usually with a red star in the middle) and by the Slovene Home Guard, the voluntary anti-Communist militia sponsored and supported by the Nazi German occupation forces.

In 1945 a red star was officially placed on the flag of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, a constituent of the Socialist Yugoslavia.
===Flag of independent Slovenia===
Following Slovene independence from Yugoslavia, the red star was removed and the new coat of arms by Marko Pogačnik was added. The flag was officially adopted on 27 June 1991, following a long and controversial dispute about the coat of arms of the new Republic.

<text>Piazza San Marco (; ), often known in English as St Mark&#x27;s Square, is the principal public square of Venice, Italy, where it is generally known just as &quot;la Piazza&quot; (&quot;the Square&quot;). The Piazzetta (&quot;little Piazza/Square&quot;) is an extension of the Piazza towards San Marco basin in its southeast corner (see plan). The two spaces together form the social, religious and political centre of Venice and are referred to together. This article relates to both of them.

A remark usually attributed (though without proof) to Napoleon calls the Piazza San Marco &quot;the drawing room of Europe&quot;.

==Description==


The square is dominated at its eastern end by St Mark&#x27;s Basilica. It is described here by a perambulation starting from the west front of the church (facing the length of the piazza) and proceeding to the right.

St Mark&#x27;s Basilica has a western façade with great arches and marble decoration, Romanesque carvings around the central doorway, and four horses which preside over the whole piazza. The four horses are potent symbols of pride and power in Venice. In 1379, the Genoese said there could be no peace between the two cities until these horses had been bridled. Four hundred years later, Napoleon, after he had conquered Venice, had them taken down and shipped to Paris.

The Piazzetta dei Leoncini is an open space on the north side of the church named after the two marble lions (presented by Doge Alvise Mocenigo in 1722), but now officially called the Piazzetta San Giovanni XXIII. The neo-classic building on the east side adjoining the Basilica is the Palazzo Patriarcale, the seat of the Patriarch of Venice.

Beyond that is St Mark&#x27;s Clocktower (&quot;Torre dell&#x27;Orologio&quot;), completed in 1499, above a high archway where the street known as the Merceria (a main thoroughfare of the city) leads through shopping streets to the Rialto, the commercial and financial centre. To the right of the clock-tower is the closed church of San Basso, designed by Baldassarre Longhena (1675), sometimes open for exhibitions.

To the left is the long arcade along the north side of the piazza, the buildings on this side are known as the Procuratie Vecchie, the old procuracies, formerly the homes and offices of the Procurators of St Mark, high officers of state in the days of the republic of Venice. They were built in the early 16th century. The arcade is lined with shops and restaurants at ground level, with offices above. The restaurants include the famous Caffè Quadri, which was patronized by the Austrians when Venice was ruled by Austria in the 19th century, while the Venetians preferred Florian&#x27;s on the other side of the piazza.

Turning left at the end, the arcade continues along the west end of the piazza, which was rebuilt by Napoleon about 1810 and is known as the Ala Napoleonica (Napoleonic Wing). It holds, behind the shops, a ceremonial staircase which was to have led to a royal palace but now forms the entrance to the Museo Correr (Correr Museum).

Turning left again, the arcade continues down the south side of the Piazza. The buildings on this side are known as the Procuratie Nuove (new procuracies), which were designed by Jacopo Sansovino in the mid-16th century but partly built (1582–86) after his death by Vincenzo Scamozzi apparently with alterations required by the procurators and finally completed by Baldassarre Longhena about 1640. Again, the ground floor has shops and also the Caffè Florian, a famous cafe opened in 1720 by Floriano Francesconi, which was patronised by the Venetians when the hated Austrians were at Quadri&#x27;s. The upper floors were intended by Napoleon to be a palace for his stepson Eugène de Beauharnais, his viceroy in Venice, and now houses the Museo Correr. At the far end the Procuratie meet the north end of Sansovino&#x27;s Libreria (mid-16th century), whose main front faces the piazzetta and is described there. The arcade continues round the corner into the Piazzetta.

Opposite to this, standing free in the piazza, is St Mark&#x27;s Campanile (1156–73 last restored in 1514), rebuilt in 1912 &quot;com&#x27;era, dov&#x27;era&quot; (&quot;as it was, where it was&quot;) after the collapse of the former campanile on 14 July 1902. Adjacent to the campanile, facing towards the church, is the small building known as the Loggetta del Sansovino, built by Sansovino in 1537–46 and used as a lobby by patricians waiting to go into a meeting of the Great Council in the Doge&#x27;s Palace and by guards when the council was sitting.

Across the piazza in front of the church are three large mast-like flagpoles with bronze bases decorated in high relief by Alessandro Leopardi in 1505. The Venetian flag of St Mark used to fly from them in the time of the republic of Venice and now shares them with the Italian flag.

==Description of the Piazzetta==

The Piazzetta di San Marco is, strictly speaking, not part of the Piazza but an adjoining open space connecting the south side of the Piazza to the waterway of the lagoon. The Piazzetta lies between the Doge&#x27;s Palace on the east and Jacopo Sansovino&#x27;s Biblioteca (Library) which holds the Biblioteca Marciana on the west.

At the corner near the campanile, this (west) side is occupied entirely by the Biblioteca (Library) designed by Jacopo Sansovino to hold the Biblioteca Marciana (library of St Mark). Building started in 1537 and it was extended, after the death of Sansovino, by Vincenzo Scamozzi in 1588–91. The building was said by Palladio to be &quot;the most magnificent and ornate structure built since ancient times&quot;. The arcade continues to the end of the building with cafés and shops and also the entrances to the Archaeological Museum, the Biblioteca Marciana and the National Library, which occupy the floors above.

At the end of this building is the Molo (the quay fronting the lagoon) and the adjoining building to the right is the Zecca (mint) also by Sansovino (completed 1547) and now part of the Biblioteca Marciana. Turning to the left at the end of the Biblioteca one crosses the open end of the Piazzetta marked by two large granite columns carrying symbols of the two patron saints of Venice. The first is Saint Theodore, who was the patron of the city before St Mark, holding a spear and with a crocodile to represent the dragon which he was said to have slain. This is made up of parts of antique statues and is a copy (the original is kept in the Doge&#x27;s Palace). The second (eastern) column has a creature representing a winged lion – the &quot;Lion of Venice&quot; – which is the symbol of St Mark. This has a long history, probably starting as a winged lion-griffin on a monument to the god Sandon at Tarsus in Cilicia (Southern Turkey) about 300 BC. The columns are now thought to have been erected about 1268, when the water was closer and they would have been on the edge of the lagoon, framing the entry to the city from the sea. Gambling was permitted in the space between the columns and this right was said to have been granted as a reward to the man who first raised the columns. Public executions also took place between the columns.

On the far side of the Piazzetta is the side wall of the Doge&#x27;s Palace with Gothic arcades at ground level and a loggia on the floor above. Up to the seventh pillar from the front this is the building as rebuilt in 1340, while the extension towards the Basilica was added in 1424. The capitals of the columns of the extended part are mostly copies of those in the front of the Palace. The seventh pillar is marked by a tondo (circular sculpture) of Venice as Justice above the first floor loggia. To the left of this, there are two red pillars in front of the first-floor loggia, contrasting with the other pillars which are of white Istrian stone. The red pillars are made of red Verona marble. They may have framed the Doge&#x27;s chair on ceremonial occasions, but it seems that important malefactors found guilty of crimes against the state would sometimes be executed there.

On the rear corner of the Doge&#x27;s Palace is a sculpture of the Judgment of Solomon with the archangel Gabriel above. The sculptors are not known. Set back from this corner is the Porta della Carta, the ceremonial entrance to the palace, built in fine Gothic style in 1438–43, probably by Giovanni and Bartolomeo Bon. Again, there is at the top a figure of Venice as Justice, the theme of fair judgment and justice being much emphasised on this side of the palace. Below this, the head of Doge Francisco Foscari and the lion before which he is kneeling were replaced in 1885, the originals having been destroyed on French orders in 1797. The statues on either side of the gateway represent the cardinal virtues of Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence and Charity.

Next to this, on an outside corner of the basilica of St Mark, are four antique figures carved in porphyry, a very hard red granite. They are usually known as the Tetrarchs and said to represent the four joint rulers of the Roman Empire appointed by Diocletian and were formerly thought to be Egyptian. It is now thought probable (or, at least very possible) that they represent the sons of the Emperor Constantine, praised for their loving co-operation on his death in 337, especially as the work originally stood in the Philadelphion (Place of Brotherly Love) in Constantinople, where the missing foot of one of the figures has been found.

Beyond this, in front of the South wall of the Basilica are two rectangular pillars always known as the Pillars of Acre. They were thought to be booty taken by the Venetians from Acre after their great victory over the Genoese there in 1258, but this traditional story has also had to be revised. The pillars actually came from the church of St Polyeuktos in Constantinople (524–27), and were probably taken by the Venetians soon after the fourth crusade in 1204. The ruins of this church were discovered in 1960 and it was excavated in the 1990s, when capitals were found, which matched the pillars.

Beyond these pillars, opposite the corner of the Basilica, is a great circular stone of red porphyry known as the Pietra del Bando (Proclamation Stone) from which official proclamations used to be read. It has been suggested that this may have formed part of a column on which the so-called Tetrarchs stood.

Across the water (the &quot;Bacino di San Marco&quot;) at the end of the Piazzetta can be seen the island of San Giorgio Maggiore and the brilliant white façade of Palladio&#x27;s church there.

==History==
The history of the Piazza San Marco can be conveniently covered in four periods, but the only pre-renaissance buildings and monuments still standing there are St Mark&#x27;s, the Doge&#x27;s Palace and the two great columns in the Piazzetta.

===Beginnings (800–1100)===
The first patron saint of Venice was St Theodore, a Greek warrior saint, and the first chapel of the Doge was dedicated to him. It was probably built about 819 and stood near the site of the present church of St Mark. In 828–829 relics of St Mark were stolen from Alexandria and brought to Venice, and in time the Venetians and the Doge adopted the apostle as their new patron. He was the missionary-apostle who was said to have converted their district; the relics of an apostle would increase the importance of the city and their acquisition was a further step in the gradual process of freeing Venice from the domination of Byzantium. The relics were temporarily placed in the palace (or castle) of the Doge, Justinian Partecipacius, who provided in his will for a new church to be built. This first church of St Mark was begun on the south side of the existing chapel; by 836 construction was sufficiently advanced for the relics to be moved there. The design of the church was based on the Church of the Twelve Apostles in Constantinople and it seems to have covered the same area as the central part of the present church. A campanile was first built in the time of Doge Pietro Tribuno (888–91).

At that time there was probably an empty space covered with grass in front of the new church, but it cannot have extended more than about 60 metres to the west, where there was a stream (the Rio Baratario) bisecting the area now occupied by the Piazza. On the other side of this stream was a small church dedicated to San Geminiano. The Doge&#x27;s palace, in the same area as its modern successor, was at that time surrounded by water. The lagoon was to the south, the Rio di Palazzo (the canal beneath the Bridge of Sighs) to the east, and another stream to the north between the palace and the church. There was an inlet from the lagoon occupying much of the space now covered by the Piazzetta and this seems to have been used as a dock for the city.

In 976 there was a rebellion against the Doge and the church was set on fire. The wooden parts, including the roof and wooden dome, were probably lost, but the church was not completely destroyed and it seems to have been rebuilt much as before. In 1063 a complete rebuilding commenced. The new church was finished in the time of Doge Vitale Falier (1084–96), and in its main structure this is the present church, though the west front facing the Piazza was then in the Romanesque style with undecorated brickwork (like the exterior of the apse today). It had five domes, but their exterior profile was low, unlike the present high, onion-shaped structures.

===Medieval piazza (1100–1490)===
Great changes to the area came when Sebastiano Ziani was Doge (1172–78). Venice was growing in importance and the Doge was a very wealthy man. He initiated the changes which created the piazza as we know it. The Rio Baratario was filled in and the church of San Geminiano on the far side was demolished and rebuilt much farther back at the western end of what became the Piazza. An orchard which occupied part of the area was acquired from the convent of San Zaccharia and the Doge bought up a number of buildings which obstructed the site. By his will he left these buildings to the state and in due course they were demolished to clear the area. The rebuilding of the 9th-century Doge&#x27;s palace also commenced in his time as Doge. The precise date of the various new buildings is not known and much must have been done in the time of his son, Pietro Ziani, who was Doge from 1205 to 1229.
The area of the piazza was now defined by the erection of buildings on the north and south sides. On the north side were the procuratie, residences and offices for the procurators of St Mark. The original procuratie were a range of two-storey buildings with a continuous arcade of stilted (i.e. tall and narrow) Byzantine arches below and a single storey above, with two windows above each arch. The ground floor rooms were let out for shops to provide an income. These buildings remained in place for about 300 years and we can see exactly how they looked in 1496 in Gentile Bellini&#x27;s painting of a procession in the piazza. This painting also shows the buildings on the opposite (south) side of the Piazza, of which the most important was the Ospizio Orseolo, an inn or hostel for pilgrims going to the Holy Land. It can be seen that the piazza was then considerably narrower than it is today, because these buildings abutted directly against the west wall of the campanile.

In 1204, Constantinople was captured in the course of the 4th Crusade and, both at that time and later during the 13th century, much valuable material was taken from the city and shipped back for the adornment of Venice. This included marbles and pillars for the façade of St Mark&#x27;s, the two square pillars in the piazzetta known (wrongly) as the Pillars of Acre and probably also the Pietra del Bando (near the south west corner of St Mark&#x27;s) and the four porphyry figures known as the Tetrarchs, which were eventually installed near the entrance to the Doge&#x27;s Palace from the piazzetta.

The two great granite columns in the Piazzetta are usually said to have been erected about 1170, but it is now thought more probable that this was done in the time of Doge Ranieri Zeno (1253–68) about 1268; the bases and capitals are 13th-century. Their origin is unknown, but Chios is suggested as possible. The lion is first mentioned in a decree of the Great Council in 1293, and the wording makes it clear that it was already on the pillar at that date. A statue of St Theodore (but not the present statue) was in place by 1329.

It was also at this time, in the later 13th century, that St Mark&#x27;s was being given its new west façade embellished with marble and mosaics and trophies from Constantinople, including the four horses.

The original 9th-century Doge&#x27;s palace was soon found too small for the number of patricians sitting on the Great Council after the right to do so was made hereditary in 1297, and rebuilding started in 1340. Work was held up by the Black Death in 1348 but the first stage was completed by 1365. This comprised the front part of the palace facing the lagoon, but in the Piazzetta the new building only extended to the seventh pillar back from the front corner, now marked by a circular relief of Venice as Justice on the outside of the first-floor arcade. Further back, part of the old palace, known as the Palace of Justice, remained, much as it had stood for about 200 years.

Because of the great expense involved, nothing more was done for many years, but in 1422 the Doge Tomaso Mocenigo insisted that for the honour of the city the remaining part of the old palace should be demolished and the new part extended. It was resolved that the existing façade should be continued in the same style, and work started in 1424 under the new Doge Francesco Foscari. The extended façade had reached the corner by 1438 and the point where the 15th-century part joins the 14th-century part can only be recognised by the circular relief of Justice above the seventh pillar from the front corner and the fact that that pillar is larger than the others, having held up the corner of the building for 80 years. The capitals on this façade are, for the most part, copies of the existing capitals on the front façade. The last pillar, at the north-western corner of the building, is a very large column and, continuing the theme of Justice, bears a large relief carving of the Judgment of Solomon, with the archangel Gabriel above it. The sculptor is not known, although various suggestions have been made including Bartolomeo Buon from Venice and Jacopo della Quercia from Siena and several art historians think that the sculpture of the Judgment of Solomon (which must have been made in the period 1424/38) shows influence from Tuscany. Eduardo Arslan, after reviewing all the theories in 1971, concluded that this sculpture &quot;remains for us a great mystery&quot;.

In 1438 a contract was made with Giovanni and Bartolomeo Buon for the construction of a great ceremonial doorway into the palace. This was the Porta della Carta and connected the newly constructed wing of the palace with the south wall of St Mark&#x27;s. Giovanni was nearing the end of his life and the gateway is mainly the work of Bartolomeo. It was completed by 1442 and included a sculpture of the Doge Francesco Foscari kneeling before the lion of St Mark. The statues of the cardinal virtues on either side were by another hand. Originally the whole gateway was painted and gilded. This is just visible in the right background of Gentile Bellini&#x27;s painting of 1496, which shows the piazza in its state at this time, still narrow and with the old 13th-century buildings on either side.

===From the Renaissance to the fall of the Republic (1490–1797)===
In 1493 an astronomical clock was commissioned by Venice and it was decided to install it in a new clocktower in the Piazza with a high archway beneath it leading into the street known as the Merceria, which leads to the Rialto. The building, which was probably designed by Codussi, was started in 1496, a section of the original Procuratie being demolished for the purpose. The building was completed with the clock installed by February 1499. It can be seen, flanked by the original Procuratie building, in de Barbari&#x27;s woodcut of Venice in 1500. The Procuratie then were only two storeys high and the tower stood higher above them than it does today.
Buildings on either side to support the tower were added by 1506 and in 1512, when there was a fire in the old Procuratie, it became obvious that the whole range would have to be rebuilt.

Although Venice was then at war with much of Europe (War of the League of Cambrai) the whole of the south side of the Piazza was rebuilt, starting in 1517. The new buildings, known today as the Procuratie Vecchie, were three storeys high instead of two. Like the previous Procuratie they had an arcade on the ground level with two windows above each arch, but without the high Byzantine arches and with classical details.

In 1527 Jacopo Sansovino came to Venice, fleeing from the sack of Rome, and by 1529 he had been appointed as Proto (consultant architect and buildings manager) to the Procurators of St. Mark. The Procurators wished to rebuild the old buildings on the south side of the Piazza, but Sansovino persuaded them that the opportunity should be taken to enlarge the Piazza and that these buildings should be demolished and the building line moved back clear of the campanile. He also convinced them that the old hostelries and shops on the west side of the Piazzetta opposite the Doge&#x27;s Palace should be replaced by a new building worthy of the site. It was decided that the library of books and manuscripts, which had been bequeathed to the city by Cardinal Bessarion but had still not found a permanent home, should be housed there and Sansovino originally intended that the façade of this building (the Libreria) should eventually be continued along the south side of the Piazza and round the south-west corner as far as the church of San Geminiano in the middle of the west side. These changes also made it necessary to rebuild the Loggetta and at the same time the government of Venice had commissioned Sansovino to rebuild the mint (the Zecca) on the west side of the Libreria. All these works were proceeding together for many years after 1537. The new Loggetta was complete by 1545 and the Zecca by 1547 (though a third storey was added by 1566), but work on the Libreria was held up by the difficulty of finding new premises for the businesses which were displaced as well as by shortage of funds and only sixteen bays (out of twenty-one) had been finished before the death of Sansovino in 1570. By that date it had not yet been possible to start on the rebuilding of the south side of the Piazza beyond the Libreria.
Sansovino also completed the rebuilding of the old church of San Geminiano at the west end of the Piazza, facing St Mark&#x27;s. Much of the work had been done before he took it over in 1557, but he was responsible for the façade in white Istrian stone. He also continued the range of Procuratie Vecchie on the north side of the Piazza round the corner as far as this church.

After the death of Sansovino funds were at last made available to start the rebuilding of the south side of the Piazza in its new position well clear of the campanile. His idea of a two-storey building continuing the façade of the Libreria had to be abandoned, as the Procurators required three storeys. However, Vincenzo Scamozzi based the design on the façade of the Libreria and completed ten bays between 1582 and 1586, The Procuratie Nuove (New Procuracies), as they are called, were not completed until 1640, when the remaining bays on the south side were completed and continued round the corner to the church of San Geminiano by Baldassarre Longhena.

===Napoleon and later (1797 onwards)===
Venice surrendered to Napoleon on 12 May 1797. By 4 June a &quot;Tree of Liberty&quot; had been placed in the Piazza. Soon afterwards stonemasons were sent out on the orders of the Municipality to destroy images of the winged lion, which was seen as a symbol of Venetian independence and aristocratic rule. On the Porta della Carta in the Piazzetta the head of Doge Francesco Foscari was removed as well as that of the lion before which he was kneeling. (They were replaced by copies later in the century). The French ordered the four horses of San Marco to be taken down and sent to Paris together with the bronze lion on the column in the Piazzetta. They were removed in December 1797.

In January 1798 under the Treaty of Campoformio the Austrians moved into Venice in place of the French. This first Austrian ascendancy lasted from 1798 to 19 January 1806, when the French moved back after Napoleon&#x27;s victories at Austerlitz and Jena and his establishment of the kingdom of Italy in 1804. Napoleon appointed his stepson Eugène de Beauharnais as his viceroy and in 1807 it was ordered that the Procuratie Nuove were to become the royal palace for his occupation. Napoleon himself paid a ceremonial visit to Venice later in 1807, landing at the Piazzetta on his way to the new palace.
It was decided that the new palace should extend across the whole of the west end of the Piazza and this made it necessary to demolish the church of San Geminiano, rebuilt by Sansovino, and also the buildings on either side, Sansovino&#x27;s extension of the Procuratie Vecchie to the north and part of the Procuratie Nuove to the south. The original architect was Gianni Antolini from Milan, but the new building caused much controversy and in 1810 he was replaced by Giovanni Soli from Modena. The present building, known as the Ala Napoleonica (the Napoleonic Wing) was built between 1810 and 1813. The façade of the two lower storeys is in the manner of the Procuratie Nuove, but the upper storey, containing the ceremonial entrance and the ballroom, has no windows or arches and is decorated with statues and sculpture in low relief. In the centre there was originally to have been a statue of Napoleon as Jupiter with the imperial arms above, but this was abandoned after the fall of Napoleon in 1814 and there is now no focal point on the west side of the Piazza.

After the abdication of Napoleon the Austrians re-occupied Venice (under the Treaty of Fontainebleau) in April 1814. The Austrian chancellor, Prince Metternich, was instrumental in arranging the return to Venice of the four horses of St Mark and the lion from the Piazzetta. The horses were re-installed in front of the Basilica on 13 December 1815, but the bronze lion had been badly broken and had to be repaired. It was placed back on its pillar in April 1816.

==Pavement==
The Piazza was paved in the late 12th century with bricks laid in a herringbone pattern. Bands of light-colored stone ran parallel to the long axis of the main piazza. These lines were probably used in setting up market stalls and in organizing frequent ceremonial processions. This original pavement design can be seen in paintings of the late Middle Ages and through the Renaissance, such as Gentile Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Procession in Piazza San Marco&quot; of 1496.
In 1723 the bricks were replaced with a more complex geometrical pavement design laid out by Venetian architect Andrea Tirali. Little is known about Tirali&#x27;s reasoning for the particulars of the design. Some have speculated that the pattern was used to regulate market stalls, or to recall their former presence in the square. Others believe the pattern was drawn from oriental rugs, a popular luxury item in this trading centre.
A field of dark-colored igneous trachyte with geometrical designs executed in white Istrian stone, similar to travertine composed the design. Squares of diagonally laid blocks alternated with rectangular and oval designs along broad parallel bands. The squares were pitched to the centre, like a bowl, where a drain conducted surface water into a below-grade drainage system. The pattern connected the central portal of the Basilica with the centre of the western opening into the piazza. This line more closely parallels the façade of the Procuratie Vecchie, leaving a nearly triangular space adjacent to the Procuratie Nuove with its wider end closed off by the Campanile. The pattern continued past the campanile, stopping at a line connecting the three large flagpoles and leaving the space immediately in front of the Basilica undecorated. A smaller version of the same pattern in the Piazzetta paralleled Sansovino&#x27;s Library, leaving a narrow trapezoid adjacent to the Doge&#x27;s palace with the wide end closed off by the southwest corner of the Basilica. This smaller pattern had the internal squares inclined to form non-orthogonal quadrilaterals.

The overall alignment of the pavement pattern serves to visually lengthen the long axis and reinforce the position of the Basilica at its head. This arrangement mirrors the interior relationship of nave to altar within the cathedral.

As part of the design, the level of the piazza was raised by approximately one meter to mitigate flooding and allow more room for the internal drains to carry water to the Grand Canal.

In 1890, the pavement was renewed &quot;due to wear and tear&quot;. The new work closely follows Tirali&#x27;s design, but eliminated the oval shapes and cut off the west edge of the pattern to accommodate the Napoleonic wing at that end of the Piazza.

==Flooding==

The Piazza San Marco is not far above sea level and during the &quot;acqua alta&quot;, the &quot;high water&quot; from storm surges from the Adriatic or heavy rain, it is quick to flood. Water pouring into the drains in the piazza runs directly into the Grand Canal. This normally works well but, when the sea is high, it has the reverse effect, with water from the lagoon surging up into the square. A historically important flood was the 1966 Venice flood, when an abnormal occurrence of high tides, rain-swollen rivers and a severe sirocco wind caused the canals to rise to a height of .

<text>The César Award is the national film award of France. It is delivered in the &quot;&quot; ceremony and was first awarded in 1976. The nominations are selected by the members of twelve categories of filmmaking professionals and supported by the French Ministry of Culture. The nationally televised award ceremony is held in Paris each year in February. The exact location has changed over the years (in the Théâtre du Châtelet from 2002 to 2016). It is an initiative of the , which was founded in 1975.

The César Award is considered the highest film honor in France, the French film industry&#x27;s equivalent to the Molière Award for theatre, and the Victoires de la Musique for music. In cinema, it is the French equivalent to the Academy Award.

The award was created by Georges Cravenne, who was also the creator of the Molière Award for theatre. The name of the award comes from the sculptor César Baldaccini (1921–1998) who designed it.

The 49th César Awards ceremony took place on 23 February 2024. &quot;Anatomy of a Fall&quot;, directed by Justine Triet, won the award for Best Film.

==History==
In 1974, Georges Cravenne founded the Academy of Arts and Techniques of Cinema that was, from the outset, intended to reward the achievements and the most remarkable film artwork, to have a French equivalent to the American Oscars. The first César Awards – also known as the &quot;Night of Caesar&quot; – were held on 3 April 1976 under the chairmanship of Jean Gabin who watched the ceremony from the front row seated in a wheelchair a few months before his death. The name of the award comes from the sculptor César, designer of the trophy awarded to the winners in each category. It is also an homage to Raimu, the great French actor and performer in the Marseille trilogy of Marcel Pagnol, in which Raimu played the character of César.

The César Awards replaced the , which was awarded from 1955 to 1975. Other prizes had been awarded to French cinema in the past. From 1934 to 1986, the , established by film pioneer Louis Lumière, was given to one film a year. In the 1950s, the was awarded each June. Lacking popular enthusiasm compared to the Étoile de cristal, this award was discontinued after 1964.

At the inaugural César Awards, 13 awards were distributed. Today, there are 22 (in nine subcategories). Categories added in recent years include Most Promising Actor/Actress (&quot;Meilleur espoir&quot;), Best Documentary (&quot;Meilleur documentaire&quot;) and Best Animated Film (&quot;Meilleur film d&#x27;animation&quot;), while awards honoring the best film poster and best producer have been dropped, as they are now given at a sister ceremony, the . In September 2021, the governing association of the César Awards voted to create two new awards that were introduced in the 47th ceremony: Best Visual Effects and Best Documentary Short Film.

Beginning with the 43rd César ceremony in 2018, a new special award, the César du public, is given to the French film with the most box office receipts during the previous year and the beginning of the current year. This award responds to the need to reward French comedy films, which remain the most popular genre in France.

During the 45th ceremony in 2020, Adèle Haenel, a French actress playing the main character in &quot;Portrait of a Lady on Fire&quot;, left the room when Roman Polanski&#x27;s award for best director was announced in protest against the fact that notable sexual abusers in the film industry can receive awards when their victims are reduced to silence. Polanski was convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old in California in 1978, and has additionally been accused of other incidents of rape.

==The statue==
The César statues are compressed sculptures of metal objects, designed in 1975 by the sculptor César Baldaccini, a friend of Georges Cravenne who gave them their name as a wink to the Oscars, the sound of the name being close to the film &quot;César&quot; by Pagnol. These forged pieces are made from polished natural bronze, unlike the Oscars which are plated in gold. The latter directly inspired the first AATC trophy in 1976, which was a reel of film encircling a silhouette. In 1977, before a mixed reception of actors, Baldaccini unveiled the current 8 by 8 cm compression, weighing 3.6 kg and cast in the Bocquel foundry in Normandy. The cost of a César has not been officially revealed, but is estimated at around 1,500 euros.

==Voting process==
Voting for César Awards is conducted through two ballots by mail: the first to establish nominations per category (three to five, depending on the discipline), and the second to decide the winner.

Voters are professionals in the field, numbering about 4,000, divided into 12 colleges (actors, directors, writers, technicians, producers, distributors and international vendors, operators, agents artistic, technical industries, casting directors, press officers and members associates). The criteria for voting are: demonstrate a relatively consistent career in film and get a double sponsorship in the Académie des arts et techniques du cinéma. Nominees or winners of the previous editions are exempt from these formalities.

To aid voters, the Académie identifies each year films released in France and provides a guide to the works and eligible professionals. A DVD set of French or primarily French productions produced during the year is sent in December with the catalog of films to the electors. After the nominations are revealed, at the end of January, special screenings of the nominated films are shown at the Le Balzac cinema in Paris, near the Champs-Élysées. Each year, a special lunch () for nominees is held at the famous Fouquet&#x27;s restaurant on the Champs-Élysées, a few weeks before the ceremony.

<text>The Aga Range Cooker is a Swedish range cooker. Invented and initially produced in Sweden, since 1957 most production has been located in the UK. In 2015, the British AGA Cooker manufacturing company, AGA Rangemaster Group, was acquired by the American corporation Middleby.

==History==
Originally developed to burn coal or anthracite, the Aga range cooker was invented in 1922 by the Nobel Prize-winning Swedish physicist Gustaf Dalén (1869–1937), who was employed as the chief engineer of the Swedish AGA company (Swedish &quot;Svenska Aktiebolaget Gasaccumulator&quot;, English &quot;Swedish Gas Accumulator, Limited&quot;). &quot;AGA&quot; stands for Aktiebolaget Gas Accumulator.

Dalén lost his sight in an explosion while developing his earlier invention, a porous substrate for storing gases, Agamassan. Forced to stay at home, Dalén discovered that his wife was exhausted by cooking. Although blind, he set out to develop a new stove that was capable of a range of culinary techniques and easy to use.

Adopting the principle of heat storage, he combined a heat source, two large hotplates and two ovens into one unit: the Aga Range Cooker. The cooker was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1929, and was manufactured there under licence in the early 1930s. Its popularity in certain parts of British society (owners of medium to large country houses) led to the coining of the term &#x27;AGA saga&#x27; in the 1990s, referring to a genre of fiction set amongst stereotypical upper-middle-class society.

David Ogilvy was initially hired as an Aga range cooker salesperson, before writing the 1935 sales manual for the product.

The cast-iron parts were cast at the Coalbrookdale foundry in the 1940s, where they were still made by the Aga Rangemaster Group until November 2017, when the new American owners Middleby closed the site with the loss of 35 jobs.

==Energy use==
A small, traditional &quot;always on&quot; two-oven model running on gas will use approximately 425kWh per week. The average standard gas oven and hob uses approximately 2.6% of the AGA range cooker&#x27;s consumption.
AGA&#x27;s own figures for expected energy consumption for their two-oven model support this criticism, suggesting average consumption of 40 litres (9 gal. imp.) of kerosene or diesel fuel per week, 60 litres (13 gal. imp.) of propane gas per week, 425 kW⋅h of natural gas per week, or 220 kW⋅h/week for the electric models. This would indicate that the smallest traditional two-oven gas AGA range cooker providing simple cooking functions (i.e. not providing a water heater or central heating) consumes thirty-eight times as much as a standard gas oven and hob, almost as much gas in a week as a standard gas oven and hob in nine months.

AGA Rangemaster Group has provided an analysis of their own, which includes the steps taken to reduce energy consumption.

The majority of AGA range cookers still sold are programmable. The 2011 model, the Total Control, uses the same radiant heat to cook, but is designed to be switched off like a regular cooker when not in use, using far less energy. Oil burning models can be fitted with a modern pressure jet oil burner in place of the standard wick burner which burns the fuel more efficiently and so reduces oil consumption.

==Models==

AGA range cookers are available in 2, 3, 4 and 5 oven models with the 4 and 5 oven versions wider than the others. Traditional AGA range cookers have a boiling and simmering plate, or in newer models with one hotplate this can be set to either boiling or simmering mode.

While the classic AGA models are on all the time, the ovens and hotplates of the newer AGA range cookers (AGA 60, Total Control, 3 Series) can be switched on and off as required and the hotplates on the Dual Control cookers can be switched on and off, meaning there is heat in to the room but energy is not used unnecessarily. The AGA 60 is the smallest in the range and is just 60 cm (2&#x27;) wide.

The Aga Range Cooker is known for its longevity, with many cookers still operating after more than 50 years. In 2009, in conjunction with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and to celebrate the 80th anniversary of its founding, AGA Rangemaster set up a competition to find the oldest AGA range cooker still in use. There were thousands of entries, but the winning cooker was installed in 1932 and belonged to the Hett family of Sussex.

<doc id="101352" wikidata="Q379575" url="?curid=101352" title="Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture">
<text>Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) is the third-generation Amiga graphic chipset, first used in the Amiga 4000 in 1992. Before release AGA was codenamed Pandora by Commodore International.

AGA was originally called AA for Advanced Architecture in the United States. The name was later changed to AGA for the European market to reflect that it largely improved the graphical subsystem, and to avoid trademark issues.

AGA is able to display graphics modes with a depth of up to s per pixel. This allows for in indexed display modes and (18-bit) in Hold-And-Modify (HAM-8) modes. The palette for the AGA chipset has 256 entries from (24-bit), whereas previous chipsets, the Original Chip Set (OCS) and Enhanced Chip Set (ECS), only allow out of 4096 or 64 colors in Amiga Extra Half-Brite (EHB mode). Other features added to AGA over ECS are super-hi-res smooth scrolling and 32-bit fast page memory fetches to supply the graphics data bandwidth for 8 bitplane graphics modes and wider sprites.

AGA is an incremental upgrade, rather than the dramatic upgrade of the other chipset that Commodore had begun in 1988, the Amiga Advanced Architecture chipset (AAA), lacking many features that would have made it competitive with other graphic chipsets of its time. Apart from the graphics data fetches, AGA still operates on 16-bit data only, meaning that significant bandwidth is wasted during register accesses and copper and blitter operations. Also the lack of a chunky graphics mode is a speed impediment to graphics operations not tailored for planar modes, resulting in ghost artifacts during the common productivity task of scrolling. In practice, the AGA HAM mode is mainly useful in paint programs, picture viewers, and for video playback. Workbench in 256 colors is much slower than ECS operation modes for normal application use; a workaround is to use multiple screens with different color depths. AGA lacks flicker free higher resolution modes, being only able to display at flicker-free operation. mode is rarely used as it can only operate at a flickering interlaced mode. In contrast, higher-end PC systems of this era can operate at with a full 256-color display. AGA&#x27;s highest resolution is in interlaced when overscan is used.

These missed opportunities in the AGA upgrade contributed to the Amiga ultimately losing technical leadership in the area of multimedia. After the long-delayed AAA was finally suspended, AGA was to be succeeded by the Hombre chipset, but this was ultimately cancelled due to Commodore&#x27;s bankruptcy.

AGA is present in the CD32, Amiga 1200, and Amiga 4000.

== Technical details ==
In order to increase memory bandwidth, the Chip RAM data bus was extended to 32-bit width as in the A3000 (unlike AGA, the A3000&#x27;s Chip RAM is 32-bit for CPU access only) and the Alice chip (replacing OCS/ECS Agnus) was improved to be able to support full-width access for bitplane DMA. Bandwidth was doubled again (to 4x) by using Fast Page Mode RAM.
Lisa (replacing former Denise) adds support for 8-bit bitplane data fetches, 256 instances of 24-bit palette registers, and for 32-bit data transfer for bitplane graphic and sprites.

The rest of the chipset remains unchanged, as do the Blitter and Copper coprocessors in Alice, still working on 16-bit data.

<text>The Westgate Hotel, Commercial Street, Newport, Wales is a hotel building dating from the 19th century. On 4 November 1839 the hotel saw the major scenes of the Newport Rising, when 3,000 Chartists, some of them armed, led by John Frost marched on Newport to attempt to secure the release of five of their number who were being held under arrest at the hotel. In the fighting between about 60 soldiers of the 45th Regiment of Foot and police on one side, and a larger number of Chartists on the other, 10-22 Chartists were killed and more than 50 wounded. The hotel is a Grade II listed building.

==History==

After the demolition of Newport&#x27;s original West city gate, the site was reclaimed and a hotel constructed in 1779 on the site of a previous 15th-century house.

The Westgate Hotel was the location of the last large-scale armed rebellion against authority in Great Britain. On 4 November 1839, local politician and activist John Frost led a protest march of 3,000 Chartists, some of them armed, into the centre of Newport. Here he discovered that several Chartists had been arrested and were being held in the Westgate Hotel by police, who were reinforced by soldiers of the 45th Regiment of Foot. Firing began (it is unclear who fired first), and in the fighting 10-22 people were killed and more than 50 others wounded. As many as 80 shots were fired into the hotel during the rising. Small holes in the pillars at the entrance to the hotel are assumed, by some, to be bullet holes from the insurrection, although this has not been evidenced. The hotel was substantially rebuilt in 1884 but the original pillars were retained, and the present structure built in French Renaissance style. Designed by local architect E. A. Lansdowne, it incorporated six shops at ground floor level to increase the site&#x27;s rental income, and placed a new five-storey hotel above, with twice the floor size of the hotel it replaced, which included an ornate ballroom. Built by local builder John Linton, it was leased from its opening in 1886 to Samuel Dean of the Castle Hotel for twenty one years.

In 2009 the building was placed on the Buildings at Risk Register as it had been substantially unoccupied for many years and the condition of its interior was beginning to cause concern. The main staircase and richly decorated public rooms are amongst the best surviving examples in the UK of their period. In 2012 Newport Unlimited announced an initiative to bring the hotel back into use. In May 2017 the property was offered for auction with a guide price of between £1.5M and £1.75M. The building was purchased in October 2017 by Rugby Property Assets Limited of Warwickshire. By 2024, little progress had been made, the building remained subject to vandalism and decay, and the council was considering enforcement action.

==Chartist legacy==
In 1991 three statues, titled &quot;Union, Prudence, Energy&quot; by sculptor Christopher Kelly, commemorating the 1839 Chartist uprising were installed on Commercial Street in front of the hotel. The hotel also featured in the 1978 Chartist Mural which was demolished during the 2013 development of Friars Walk in Newport city centre. 

The story of the rebellion was reflected in the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; 2014 song &quot;The View from Stow Hill&quot;.

In July 2019, Our Chartist Heritage announced they would re-open part of the Westgate Buildings for a temporary display. The charity worked with the consortium who own the building, and local Newport graphic artist Josh Cranton, to bring the building up to a viable state for public access, ahead of the anniversary of the Chartist Rising. The interior was repainted and a free display was organised to commemorate the events of the rising.

<text>A chartist (also known as a technical trader or technical analyst) is one who utilizes charts to assess patterns of activity that might be helpful in making predictions. Most commonly, chartists use technical analysis in the financial world to evaluate financial securities. For example, a chartist may plot past values of stock prices in an attempt to denote a trend from which he or she might infer future stock prices. The chartist&#x27;s philosophy is that &quot;history repeats itself&quot;. Technical analysis assumes that a stock&#x27;s price reflects all that is known about a company at any given point in time.

<doc id="101356" wikidata="Q778747" url="?curid=101356" title="Horse Cave, Kentucky">
<text>Horse Cave is a home rule-class city in Hart County, Kentucky, United States. Randall Curry currently serves as mayor of the city and is assisted by a city council that is composed of six members. As of the 2010 census, the population of Horse Cave was 2,311, making it the most populous community in the county.

==History==
The town was settled by Major Albert Anderson in the 1840s. The landowner donated land for a Louisville and Nashville Railroad station in 1858 on the provision that it be named after nearby Horse Cave. The community around the station developed quickly, so that a post office was erected in 1860, and the city was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1864.

The cave for which the city is named is located on the south side of Main Street. Various explanations are given for its unusual name. One is that Native Americans or outlaws hid horses in the cave; another is that an early carriage may have lost a horse when it fell into the opening by accident; a third reason involves the 19th-century use of &quot;horse&quot; as slang for anything big or huge, related to a similar use of the Swedish &quot;hoss&quot;. The cave has also been known as &quot;Hidden River Cave&quot;, for an underground stream located inside. That stream was used to power a dynamo, and for a while in the late 19th century Horse Cave was the only city in Kentucky apart from Louisville and Ashland to have electric lights. Around World War I, the only air-conditioned tennis courts in the world were located near the entrance of the cave. The stream also provided the town&#x27;s water supply, but mistaken development caused raw sewage to seep into the water and forced the closure of the cave for fifty years. The stench was so bad in the 1960s that pedestrians typically crossed to the other side of Main Street rather than walk near the entrance and birds would sometimes fall from the sky. The problem has been largely solved in recent years.

The town changed its name to &quot;Caverna&quot; in 1869 but the inability to change the name of the railroad station prompted the community to reconsider and restore the name &quot;Horse Cave&quot; in 1879. Owing to its early rail connection, Horse Cave was a major center of agricultural commerce for Hart, Metcalfe, Green, and Barren counties since the 1870s. Tobacco warehouses provided the majority of the income.

Since the 1970s, some factories have relocated to the area, including Dart Container Corporation, T Marzetti Company, and Sister Schubert&#x27;s Bakery. Tourist attractions include Kentucky Down Under/Kentucky Caverns, Hidden River Cave/American Cave Museum, and the nearby Mammoth Cave National Park. Civil War Days are an annual tourist event, during which time parades down Main Street and reenactments of the Battle of Rowlett&#x27;s Station between Horse Cave and Munfordville are staged. A local theatre formerly known as the Horse Cave Theatre and/or the Kentucky Repertory Theatre once operated in Horse Cave but is no longer in business. Horse Cave serves as filming location for several films, including &quot;Runaway Romance&quot; and &quot;Never Forgive.&quot;

Artist Joseph Dudley Downing (1925–2007) was born and grew up in Horse Cave, where he graduated valedictorian of his class. In 1980, an exhibition of 150 of his paintings was held in the People&#x27;s Loose Leaf Tobacco Warehouse No. 2.

<doc id="101357" wikidata="Q822640" url="?curid=101357" title="New Jersey Route 41">
<text>Route 41 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs from the five-way intersection of Route 47 (Delsea Drive), County Route 603 (CR 603; Fairview-Sewell Road/Blackswood-Barnsboro Road), and CR 630 (Egg Harbor Road), also known as Five Points, in Deptford Township, Gloucester County, north to the southern terminus of CR 611 in Maple Shade, Burlington County, just north of the Route 41&#x27;s interchanges with Route 38 and Route 73. The route is a two- to four-lane suburban road that passes through several communities, including Runnemede, Haddonfield, and Cherry Hill Township. Between the intersection with Route 168 in Runnemede and Route 154 in Cherry Hill Township, Route 41 is maintained by Camden County and is also signed as County Route 573 (CR 573).

Route 41 was legislated in 1927 to run from Route 47 in Fairview, Deptford Township to Route 38 in Moorestown. Originally, the route was intended to bypass Haddonfield, however this bypass was never fully completed and Route 41 was signed along a temporary county-maintained alignment that also became CR 573. The northern part of this bypass was completed and became Route 154 in 1953. The road has seen many changes including the replacement of the traffic circle with Routes 38 and 73 with an interchange that involved realigning Route 41 around the original circle in 1960 and the replacement of the Ellisburg Circle at Routes 70 and 154 with a signalized intersection in the early 1990s. The temporary alignment of Route 41 along CR 573 was made permanent in the early 2000s.

==Route description==

Route 41 heads north from the Five Points intersection with Route 47 (Delsea Drive), CR 603 (Fairview-Sewell Road/Blackswood-Barnsboro Road), and CR 630 (Egg Harbor Road) in Deptford Township, Gloucester County, on a two-lane, undivided road called Hurffville Road. The route intersects CR 621 (County House Road) and then intersects CR 534 (Good Intent Road). The route continues north and meets Deptford Center Road, which heads west and provides access to the Deptford Mall and the Route 55 freeway, and a ramp to southbound Route 42 (North–South Freeway). Route 41 comes to an interchange with the Route 42 freeway, with access provided to and from northbound Route 42. Past Route 42, Route 41 intersects CR 544 (Clements Bridge Road), with which it forms a concurrency.
The route crosses the Big Timber Creek into Camden County, running along the border of Runnemede and Gloucester Township. CR 544 veers to the right onto Evesham Road, and Route 41 continues northeast on Clements Bridge Road into Runnemede. At the intersection with Route 168 (Black Horse Pike), Route 41 becomes county-maintained and runs concurrent with CR 573. The two routes cross into Barrington, where they pass over the New Jersey Turnpike. Upon crossing Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line, Route 41 and CR 573 run along the border of Barrington and Haddon Heights, with Barrington to the southeast and Haddon Heights to the northwest. The two routes pass under Interstate 295 (I-295) before meeting U.S. Route 30 (US 30, White Horse Pike) at a modified traffic circle.
Route 41 and CR 573 continue north on Highland Avenue and cross into Haddonfield, where the road becomes Chews Landing Road. The two routes meet CR 551 Spur (Kings Highway), and they bear to the right onto Kings Highway, heading northeast. They pass over NJ Transit’s Atlantic City Line and the PATCO Speedline south of the Haddonfield PATCO station and then intersect CR 561 (Haddon Avenue) Past CR 561, the road crosses the Cooper River into Cherry Hill Township. Route 41 and CR 573 make a right turn onto a four-lane divided highway and intersect Route 154 (Brace Road). At this point, CR 573 ends and Route 41 makes a left turn onto a six-lane divided highway, becoming state-maintained again and forming a concurrency with Route 154.

At the point Route 41 crosses Route 70 (Marlton Turnpike), Route 154 ends and Route 41 continues to the northeast on Kings Highway, a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane. Route 41 becomes a four-lane divided highway at the crossing of the Pennsauken Creek and enters Maple Shade Township, Burlington County. The route interchanges with Route 38 and with Route 73 a short distance later. It continues to the northeast, where Route 41 ends at the end of state maintenance and Kings Highway continues northeast as CR 611.

==History==

From Moorestown to Haddonfield, the road was created as part of a King&#x27;s Highway legislated in 1681 to connect South Amboy and Salem. Route 41 was legislated in 1927 to run from Route 47 in Fairview in Deptford Township to Route 38 in Moorestown along its current alignment, except through Haddonfield, which it was to bypass to the east. Also legislated in 1927 was a spur of Route 41, Route S41, which was to run from the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge to Berlin. Later spurs of Route 41 included Route S41A, which was a southern extension of Route S41 from Berlin to Route 42 (now US 322) in Folsom proposed in 1938. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Routes S41 and S41A became Route 73 and Route 41 was legislated along a county-maintained temporary route between Route 168 in Runnemede and Route 70 in Cherry Hill Township, signed Route 41 Temporary, when it became apparent the bypass around Haddonfield would not be fully completed. Only the northernmost section of the bypass between CR 561 and Route 70 had been built and this eventually became Route 154. The county-maintained section of Route 41 also became known as CR 573.

Since 1953, many changes have occurred along Route 41. During reconstruction of the traffic circle between Routes 38, 41, and 73 into an interchange by the 1970s, Route 41 was relocated to a new alignment that bypassed the original traffic circle and extended north a short distance on Kings Highway to just south of the CR 608 (Lenola Road) intersection in Maple Shade Township. The Ellisburg Circle at the intersection of Routes 41, 70, and 154 was reconstructed into an intersection with jughandles and traffic lights by the 1990s. This reconstruction involved realigning Route 41 to form a brief concurrency with Route 154 just south of Route 70. In the early 2000s, the Route 41 interchange with Route 42 in Deptford Township was, along with the CR 544 interchange with Route 42, reconstructed to ease traffic movements in the area. Signs for Route 41 Temporary and CR 573 still remain along this stretch of Route 41, which today is officially considered to be a part of mainline Route 41.

<doc id="101358" wikidata="Q1273568" url="?curid=101358" title="Children's television series">
<text>Children&#x27;s television series (or children&#x27;s television shows) are television programs designed specifically for children. They are typically characterised by easy-going content devoid of sensitive or adult themes and are normally broadcast during the morning and afternoon when children are awake, immediately before and after school schedules generally start in the country where they air. Educational themes are also prevalent, as well as the transmission of cautionary tales and narratives that teach problem-solving methods in some fashion or another, such as social disputes.

The purpose of these shows, aside from profit, is mainly to entertain or educate children, with each series targeting a certain age of child: some are aimed at infants and toddlers, some are aimed at those aged 6 to 11 years old, and others are aimed at all children. 

==History==
Children&#x27;s television is nearly as old as television itself. In the United Kingdom, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;For the Children&quot; was first broadcast in 1946, and in English-speaking circles, is generally credited with being the first TV programme specifically for children.

Some authors posit television for children tended to originate from similar programs on radio. For example, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; was launched as a radio broadcast in 1922, with BBC School Radio commencing live broadcasts in 1924.

In the early 1930s, radio adventure serials such as &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; began to emerge in the United States and became a staple of children&#x27;s afternoon radio listening.

===Evolution of style in the US and beyond===
Early children&#x27;s shows included &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; (1947), &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;, and &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. Another show, &quot;Ding Dong School&quot;, aired from 1952 to 1965. Its creator and host, Frances Horwich, would sit in front of the camera and simulate small talk with the viewing audience at home, demonstrating basic skills for the camera.

This practice lives on in contemporary children&#x27;s broadcasting as a genre in of itself, with Australia&#x27;s ongoing program &quot;Play School&quot; one example.

At one time, a program called &quot;Winky Dink and You&quot; took a more interactive approach, prompting its viewers to affix a clear vinyl sheet to their television and draw pictures to match what was going on on-screen. This format did not persist, nor was it replicated, due to a number of factors unrelated to its popularity: children whose parents did not buy them the vinyl sheet would draw with crayons directly on the television screen itself, potentially causing expensive damage; there were also concerns that having children within arm&#x27;s length of a television screen of the era could expose them to harmful radiation.

Later and more recognisably modern shows for young children include &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;The Electric Company&quot; and &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;. In the 1990s, more children&#x27;s television series such as &quot;Barney &amp; Friends,&quot; &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues,&quot; &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants,&quot; &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House,&quot; and &quot;The Big Comfy Couch&quot; were created.

A voluminous range of children&#x27;s television programming now exists in the 2020s.

Notable successes outside the US include shows like &quot;Play School&quot;, &quot;Noggin the Nog&quot;, &quot;Clangers&quot;, &quot;Bagpuss&quot;, &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, &quot;Count Duckula&quot;, &quot;Mr. Men&quot; and &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; originating from the UK, &quot;Paw Patrol&quot; from Canada, &quot;Le Manege Enchantè&quot; from France, &quot;The Singing Ringing Tree&quot; from Germany, and &quot;Marine Boy&quot; and &quot;Pokémon&quot; from Japan.

Canadian studio Nelvana is a particularly prolific producer of children&#x27;s programming. Much of Nelvana&#x27;s product is broadcast worldwide, especially in the US, where the similarities in dialect do not require any dubbing or localization.

=== Role of advertising ===

In the United States, early children&#x27;s television was often co-opted as a platform to market products and it rarely contained any educational elements (for instance, &quot;The Magic Clown&quot;, a popular early children&#x27;s program, was primarily an advertisement for Bonomo&#x27;s Turkish taffy.) In the early years of television, advertising to children posed a dilemma as most children have no disposable income of their own. As such, children&#x27;s television was not a particularly high priority for the networks.

This practice continued in a toned-down manner through the 1980s in the United States after the Federal Communications Commission prohibited tie-in advertising on broadcast television. These regulations did not apply to cable, which remains out of the reach of the FCC&#x27;s content regulations.

Due in part to the success of &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;, the 1980s saw a dramatic rise in television programs featuring characters of whom toy characters were being sold to retail consumers in bricks and mortar stores, underscoring the value potential of manufacturing merchandise for fans of children&#x27;s programs. This practice remains firmly embedded in the broadcast sector&#x27;s business case broadly in the 2020s.

Commercial-free children television was first introduced with &quot;Sesame Street&quot; on PBS in November 1969. It was produced by what is now known as Sesame Workshop (formerly Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, known as CTW).

=== Saturday morning cartoon blocks ===
In the United States, Saturday mornings were generally scheduled with cartoons from the 1960s to 1980s.

In 1992, teen comedies and a &quot;Today&quot; show weekend edition were first to displace the cartoon blocks on NBC. Starting in September 2002, the networks turned to affiliated cable cartoon channels or outside programmers for their blocks.

On September 27, 2014, the last traditional Saturday network morning cartoon block, &quot;Vortexx&quot;, ended and was replaced the following week by the syndicated &quot;One Magnificent Morning&quot; on The CW.

=== Demographics ===
Children&#x27;s television series can target a wide variety of key demographics based on age and gender. Few television networks target infants and toddlers under two years of age.
Preschool-oriented programming is generally more overtly educational. In a number of cases, such shows are produced in consultation with educators and child psychologists in an effort to teach age-appropriate lessons (the series &quot;Sesame Street&quot; pioneered this approach when it debuted in 1969). A format that has increased in popularity since the 1990s is the &quot;pseudo-interactive&quot; program, in which the action of the show stops and breaks the fourth wall to give a young viewer the opportunity to answer a question or dilemma put forth on the show, with the action continuing as if the viewer answered correctly, Shows targeting this demographic are generally DVD-only.

Shows that target the demographic of persons 6 to 11 years old focus primarily on entertainment and can range from comedic cartoons to action series. Most children&#x27;s television series targeting this age range are animated (with a few exceptions, perhaps the best-known being the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise). Typically, programs are either &#x27;for boys&#x27; or &#x27;for girls&#x27;.

The teen demographic targets viewers 12 to 18 years of age. Live-action series that target this demographic are more dramatic and developed, including teen dramas and teen sitcoms. In some cases, they may contain more mature content that is usually not permissible on shows targeting younger viewers, and can include some profanity or suggestive dialogue.

Educational programming targeted at this demographic has historically been rare, other than on NASA TV&#x27;s education block. However, some programming aimed at the demographic has had some tangential educational value in regard to social issues, such as the now-defunct TNBC block of sitcoms, which often tackled issues such as underage drinking or drug use.

=== Under-represented groups ===
According to at least one journalist, for years, Broadcast Standards and Practices departments of networks, Parental Guidelines, and campaigns by social conservatives limited &quot;efforts to make kids animation more inclusive.&quot;

One former executive of Disney, David Levine, said that &quot;a lot of conservative opinion&quot; drove what was depicted on Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, and other alike channels. Some argued that cable television, which began to pick up in the 1990s, &quot;opened the door for more representation&quot; even though various levels of approvals remained.

Through the 2000s&#x27;, advocacy group GLAAD repeatedly highlighted the lack of LGBT representation in children&#x27;s programming in particular. Two years later, they recorded the highest number of LGBTQ characters they ever recorded up to that point.

In 2017, some said that LGBTQ+ characters in animated television were somewhat rare, despite the fact that GLAAD praised the number of characters in broadcast and primetime television.

From 2017 to 2019, Insider noted that there was a &quot;more than 200% spike in queer and gender-minority characters in children&#x27;s animated TV shows.&quot; In 2018 and 2019, GLAAD stated that Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix, had increased LGBTQ representation in &quot;daytime kids and family television.&quot;

In their January 2021 report, GLAAD praised LGBTQ representation in episodes of &quot;DuckTales&quot;, &quot;The Owl House&quot; and &quot;Adventure Time: Distant Lands&quot;. Despite this, some industry practitioners state that more than 90% of LGBTQ characters in kid&#x27;s animated shows within Insider&#x27;s database of characters in children&#x27;s animated television shows &quot;require either a cable, satellite, streaming, or internet subscription to view them on first airing.&quot;

==Channels==
===United States===
In the United States, there are three major commercial cable networks dedicated to children&#x27;s television. All three also operate secondary services with specialized scopes drawing upon their respective libraries, such as a focus on specific demographics, or a focus upon classic programming that fall within their scope and demographics; all three have also extensively franchised their brands outside the United States.
* Nickelodeon, the first children&#x27;s television channel, launched in 1979 (though its history traces back to the 1977 launch of QUBE&#x27;s C-3 channel); it consists largely of original series aimed at children, preteens and young teenagers, including animated series, to live-action comedy and action series, as well as series aimed at preschoolers, and appeals to adult and adolescent audiences with a lineup of mainly live-action sitcom reruns and a limited amount of original programming on Nick at Nite.
** Nickelodeon operates four digital cable and satellite channels separate from the main service: Nick Jr. Channel, a channel devoted to preschool programming; Nicktoons, which primarily (although not exclusively) runs animated programming; NickMusic, a pop music video service branded as &quot;MTV Hits&quot; prior to 2016; and TeenNick, a channel devoted to live-action programming and sometimes animated. This is in addition to a flexible number of free digital channels under the Nickelodeon brand on parent company Paramount Global&#x27;s over-the-top service Pluto TV. Subscription video on demand service Paramount+ includes much of the Nickelodeon archives.
* Cartoon Network, launched in 1992, is devoted primarily to animated programming. It primarily targets children 6–12, while its early morning Cartoonito is aimed at preschoolers and kindergarteners aged 2–6, and its overnight daypart block Adult Swim targets older teenagers and young adults aged 16–34.
** Cartoon Network operates one digital cable channel: Boomerang, a channel that specializes in programs centered around classic brands that parent company Warner Bros. Discovery owns (particularly Hanna-Barbera, MGM and Warner Bros. Animation), along with some imported programs, reruns of Cartoon Network original programs, and burn-off properties. Warner Bros. Discovery also operates Discovery Family (along with its Spanish-language counterpart Discovery Familia), a joint venture with Hasbro that Warner Bros. acquired a majority stake in along with its merger with Discovery Channel and carries animated programming in daytime along with family-oriented factual programming (including Discovery library programs) at nighttime; HBO Family, a channel in the company&#x27;s premium cable suite HBO that includes a block of children&#x27;s programs (Play Off) in the morning and family-friendly films the rest of the day; MeTV Toons, a joint venture with Weigel Broadcasting that operates on the digital subchannels of Weigel-owned stations and other affiliates of its parent network MeTV and carries much of the same program library as Boomerang.
* Disney Channel launched in 1983 as a premium channel; it consists of original first-run television series, theatrically released and original made-for-cable movies, and select other third-party programming. Disney Channel – which formerly operated as a pay-TV service – originally marketed its programs towards families during the 1980s, and later at younger children by the 1990s. Then, they marketed its programs at tweens aged 9-14 between 1998 and 2004. After 2004, they marketed their programs at preadolescent kids ages 9-12.
** Disney Channel operates two digital channels separate from the main service: Disney Jr., which launched in 2011 and primarily broadcasts animated series catered towards a preschool audience, and Disney XD, which caters primarily to an older youth audience with an action-oriented focus. Disney does not have a traditional television outlet for its archival programming, which it has historically kept in a proverbial vault with limited access; much of its programming is available through Disney+, a subscription video on demand service. Disney also operates Freeform, a channel primarily carrying live-action programming catered towards a teenage/young adult audience. Although its previous incarnations under other owners had family-oriented formats and children&#x27;s programming, they have since been phased out in favor of series such as teen dramas, some coming from Disney Channel.

Under current mandates, all broadcast television stations in the United States must show a minimum of three hours per week of educational children&#x27;s programming, regardless of format. Until 2019, this rule also applied to digital subchannels; as a result, digital multicast networks whose formats should not fit children&#x27;s programming, such as Live Well Network and TheCoolTV, were required to carry educational programs to fit the FCC mandates. (The rule for digital subchannels was repealed in July 2019; in practice, most still carry educational programs anyway.) In 2017, there was a programming block that aired on syndication called KidsClick; it was notable as a concerted effort to program children&#x27;s shows on television without regard to their educational content, one of the first such efforts since the E/I rule took effect. The transition to digital television has allowed for the debut of whole subchannels that air children&#x27;s programming 24/7; examples include Universal Kids, PBS Kids and BabyFirst. The country&#x27;s only directly nationally operated TV service for public consumption, NASA TV, also includes educational programs in its schedule for use in schools.

===Canada===
English-language children&#x27;s specialty channels in Canada are primarily owned by Corus Entertainment and WildBrain. Corus operates YTV and Treehouse, as well as localized versions of the Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, and Nickelodeon brands. WildBrain operates Family Channel, as well as the spin-off services WildBrainTV and Family Jr. it has been majority owned and operated by British Columbia&#x27;s public broadcaster Knowledge Network.

In French, Corus operates Télétoon and La chaîne Disney, WildBrain operates Télémagino (a French version of Family Jr.), TVA Group operates the preschool-oriented Yoopa, and Bell Media runs the teen-oriented Vrak. Via its majority-owned subsidiary Telelatino, Corus also operates two children and family-oriented networks in Spanish and Italian, TeleNiños and Telebimbi respectively.

On broadcast television and satellite to cable undertakings, children&#x27;s television content is relegated to the country&#x27;s public and designated provincial educational broadcasters, including CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada Télé, as well as City Saskatchewan, CTV Two Alberta (formerly Access), Knowledge Network, Télé-Québec, TFO, and TVOntario (TVOKids).

Aided by the cultural similarities between Canada and the US, along with film credits and subsidies available from the Canadian government, a large number of animated children&#x27;s series have been made in Canada with the intention of exporting them to the United States. Such programs carry a prominent Government of Canada wordmark in their closing credits.

===United Kingdom===

The BBC and ITV plc both operate children&#x27;s oriented television networks on digital terrestrial television: the BBC runs CBBC as well as the preschool-oriented CBeebies, while ITV runs CITV as well as the preschool-oriented LittleBe, as a programming block on ITVBe. Both channels were spun off from children&#x27;s television strands on their respective flagship channels (BBC One, BBC Two, and ITV). The BBC and ITV have largely phased out children&#x27;s programming from their main channels to focus on the dedicated services; in 2012, as part of the &quot;Delivering Quality First&quot; initiative, the BBC announced that it would end the broadcast of CBBC programmes on BBC One following the completion of the transition to digital terrestrial television, citing low viewership in comparison to broadcasts of the programmes on the CBBC channel. Channel 5 also broadcasts a preschool-oriented block known as &quot;Milkshake!&quot;, while its owner, Paramount Networks International, also runs versions of Nickelodeon and its sister networks Nicktoons and Nick Jr.

Narrative Capital operate a number of children&#x27;s channels under the Pop and Tiny Pop brands. British versions of Cartoon Network and its sister channels Boomerang and Cartoonito also operate in the country, some 25 years after the initial launch.

===Ireland===
Ireland has one dedicated children&#x27;s TV service RTÉjr. Since 1998 RTÉ2 has provided children&#x27;s programming from 07:00 to 17:30 each weekday, originally titled The Den, the service was renamed TRTÉ and RTÉjr in 2010. Irish-language service TG4 provide two strands of children&#x27;s programming Cúla 4 Na nÓg and Cúla 4 during the day. Commercial broadcaster TV3 broadcast a children&#x27;s strand called &quot;Gimme 3&quot; from 1998 to 1999. And then broadcast a new strand called 3Kids.

===Australia===
Children&#x27;s channels that exist in Australia are ABC Family, ABC Kids, and its spin-off CBeebies, Nickelodeon and its spin-off Nick Jr., and Cartoon Network and its spin-off Boomerang.

===Japan===

Children&#x27;s channels that exist in Japan are NHK Educational TV, Kids Station, Disney Channel, , Nickelodeon (also under a block on Animax, known as &quot;Nick Time&quot;) and Cartoon Network (Cartoon Network&#x27;s age demographic is moving towards older viewers with shows such as &quot;Hello Kitty&quot;, &quot;Regular Show&quot; and &quot;Adventure Time&quot;)

===Iceland===
One of the most well-known children&#x27;s TV programmes comes from Iceland, LazyTown, was created by Magnus Scheving, European Gymnastics Champion and CEO of Lazytown Entertainment. The show has aired in over 180 countries, been dubbed into more than 32 languages and is the most expensive children&#x27;s show of all time.

===India===
In 1995, Cartoon Network became the first children&#x27;s channel to be launched in India. Subsequently, Disney Channel and Nickelodeon arrived. Hungama TV (2004) was the first children&#x27;s channel that had local content. Pogo and BabyTV came later in 2006. By 2018, 23 channels have aired in India.

===Romania===
Nickelodeon was the first children&#x27;s channel in Romania, launched in December 1998. Afterwards, Minimax became the first Romanian children&#x27;s channel to air locally produced content, launched on Children&#x27;s Day in 2001. Since then, channels like BabyTV and Disney Channel have arrived.

===Turkey===

<text>London Gatwick (), also known as Gatwick Airport , is the secondary international airport serving London, England. It is located near Crawley, West Sussex, England
 south of Central London. In 2022, Gatwick was the second-busiest airport by total passenger traffic in the UK, after Heathrow Airport, and was the 8th-busiest in Europe by total passenger traffic. It covers a total area of .

Gatwick opened as an aerodrome in the late 1920s; it has been in use for commercial flights since 1933. The airport has two terminals, the North Terminal and the South Terminal, which cover areas of and respectively. It operates as a single-runway airport, using a main runway with a length of . A secondary runway is available but, due to its proximity to the main runway, can only be used if the main runway is not in use. In 2018, 46.1 million passengers passed through the airport, a 1.1% increase compared with 2017.

Gatwick is the secondary London hub for British Airways and the largest operating base for low-cost carrier easyJet.

==History==
===Early years===
The land on which Gatwick Airport stands was first developed as an aerodrome in the late 1920s. The Air Ministry approved commercial flights from the site in 1933, and the first terminal, &quot;The Beehive&quot;, was built in 1935. Scheduled air services from the new terminal began the following year. During the Second World War, the airport was taken over by the military and was known as RAF Gatwick. After the war, the airport returned to its civilian capacity. The airport proper was built in the mid-1950s opening in 1956. The airport buildings were designed by Yorke Rosenberg Mardall between 1955 and 1988.

In the 1960s, British United Airways (BUA) and Dan-Air were two of the largest British independent airlines at Gatwick, with the former establishing itself as the dominant scheduled operator at the airport as well as providing a significant number of the airport&#x27;s non-scheduled services and the latter becoming its leading provider of inclusive tour charter services. Further rapid growth of charter flights at Gatwick was encouraged by the Ministry of Aviation, which instructed airlines to move regular charter flights from Heathrow. Following the takeover of BUA by Caledonian Airways at the beginning of the following decade, the resulting airline, British Caledonian (BCal), became Gatwick&#x27;s dominant scheduled airline during the 1970s. While continuing to dominate scheduled operations at Gatwick for most of the 1980s, BCal was also one of the airport&#x27;s major charter airlines until the end of the 1970s (together with Dan-Air, Laker Airways and British Airtours). 

As a result of conditions imposed by Britain&#x27;s Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the takeover of BCal by the then newly privatised British Airways (BA) at the end of the 1980s, Dan-Air and Air Europe assumed BCal&#x27;s former role as Gatwick&#x27;s dominant scheduled short-haul operator while BA continued in BCal&#x27;s erstwhile role as the airport&#x27;s most important scheduled long-haul operator. Following the demise of Air Europe and Dan-Air (both of which had continued to provide a significant number of charter flights in addition to a growing number of scheduled short-haul flights at Gatwick) in the early 1990s, BA (having purchased Dan-Air) began building up Gatwick into a secondary hub (complementing its main hub at Heathrow). These moves resulted in BA becoming Gatwick&#x27;s dominant airline by the turn of the millennium. BA&#x27;s subsequent decision to de-hub Gatwick provided the space for easyJet to establish its biggest base at the airport and become its dominant airline.

===Transatlantic flights to the United States===
From 1978 to 2008, many flights to and from the United States used Gatwick because of restrictions on the use of Heathrow implemented in the Bermuda II Agreement between the UK and the US. The EU–US Open Skies Agreement, which became effective on 30 March 2008, led several airlines to downsize their transatlantic operations at Gatwick in favour of Heathrow. Continental Airlines was the second transatlantic carrier (after American Airlines) to leave Gatwick after it decided to transfer the seasonal Cleveland service to Heathrow on 3 May 2009.

US Airways, Gatwick&#x27;s last remaining US carrier, ended its service between Gatwick and Charlotte on 30 March 2013. This left Gatwick without a scheduled US airline for the first time in 35 years. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Delta Air Lines announced its intent to launch service between Gatwick and Boston in the summer of 2020, which would have made it the first US airline to service Gatwick since the withdrawal of the US Airways service in 2013, but the massive global travel downturn placed these plans on indefinite hold. In 2021, JetBlue became the first US airline to serve Gatwick since 2013, with services to New York–JFK and Boston.

===Development since the 2000s===
On 17 September 2008, BAA announced it would sell Gatwick after the Competition Commission published a report about BAA&#x27;s market dominance in London and the South East. On 21 October 2009, it was announced that an agreement had been reached to sell Gatwick to a consortium led by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which subsequently also bought Edinburgh Airport in 2012, for £1.51 billion. The sale was completed on 3 December. In February 2010, GIP sold minority stakes in the airport of 12% and 15% to the South Korean National Pension Service and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) for £100 million and £125 million, respectively. The sales were part of GIP&#x27;s strategy to syndicate the equity portion of the original acquisition by issuing bonds to refinance bank debt. Although this entails bringing additional investors into the airport, GIP aims to retain management control. 

The Californian state pension fund CalPERS acquired a 12.7% stake in Gatwick Airport for about $155 million (£104.8 million) in June 2010. On 21 December 2010, the A$69 billion (£44 billion) Future Fund, a sovereign wealth fund established by the Australian government in 2006, agreed to purchase a 17.2% stake in Gatwick Airport from GIP for £145 million. This transaction completed GIP&#x27;s syndication process for the airport, reducing its stake to 42% (although the firm&#x27;s extra voting rights meant it still controlled the airport&#x27;s board).

In August 2020, the airport announced plans to cut over a quarter of its employees as a result of a planned company restructuring caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The planned cuts will bring the total workforce of the airport to 1,900; before the start of the pandemic it was 3,300, however, an additional 785 jobs were cut earlier in 2020.

==Ownership==
BAA Limited (now Heathrow Airport Holdings) and its predecessors, BAA plc and the British Airports Authority, owned and operated Gatwick from 1 April 1966 to 2 December 2009.

The airport is owned and operated by Gatwick Airport Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ivy Holdco Limited, owned by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), itself owned by BlackRock. In December 2018, Vinci announced that it would acquire a 50.01% majority stake for £2.9bn, with a GIP-managed consortium of investors (Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Australia&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund and two public pension funds in California and South Korea) owning the remaining 49.9%. The sale was completed by the middle of 2019.

In August 2021, it was reported that Gatwick&#x27;s operators were in talks with lenders following posting first-half-year net losses of £ 245m.

In September 2023, Margaret Ford, Baroness Ford was announced as the new Chair of Gatwick Airport.

==Operations==
=== Facilities ===

On 31 May 2008, Virgin Holidays opened the V Room, Gatwick&#x27;s first lounge dedicated to their long-haul leisure travellers. On 25 January 2017, the lounge moved to the North Terminal together with the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse as part of the airline moves that saw British Airways and Virgin Atlantic exchange their previous terminal locations and easyJet consolidated in the North Terminal. On 9 April 2009, an independent pay-for-access lounge opened in the South Terminal. Gatwick also has a conference and business centre, and several on- and off-site hotels ranging in class from executive to economy.

The airport has Anglican, Catholic and Free Church chaplains, and there are multi-faith prayer and counselling rooms in each terminal. A daily service is led by one of the chaplains.

The Civil Aviation Authority Safety Regulation Group is in Aviation House. WesternGeco, a geophysical services company, has its head office and Europe–Africa–Russia offices in Schlumberger House, a building on the airport grounds near the South Terminal. The company had a 15-year lease on the building, scheduled to expire in June 2008. In 2007, WesternGeco reached an agreement with its landlord, BAA Lynton, extending its lease to 2016 at an initial rent of £2.1 million. Fastjet has its registered and head offices at Suite 2C in First Point at the airport.

Before the sale, BAA planned an £874 million investment at Gatwick over five years, including increased capacity for both terminals, improvements to the transport interchange and a new baggage system for the South Terminal. Passengers passing through the airport are informed about the redevelopment programme with large mobile barcodes on top of construction hoardings. Scanning these transfers information on the construction to the user&#x27;s smartphone.

In the summer of 2013, Gatwick introduced &quot;Gatwick Connect&quot;, a free flight connection service to assist passengers changing flights at Gatwick whose airlines do not provide a full flight connection service. On 15 September 2015, the service was rebranded as &quot;GatwickConnects&quot;. It is available to passengers connecting on several major airlines.

===Flight movements===
Gatwick operates as a single-runway airport although it has two runways; the northern runway (08L/26R) can only be used when the main runway (08R/26L) is out of use. The UK Integrated Aeronautical Information Package gives the Takeoff Run Available (TORA) of its main runway (08R/26L) as 3,255 m when aircraft take off in a westerly direction (26) and 3,159 m when takeoffs occur in an easterly direction (08). The documentation lists the respective TORA for the northern runway (08L/26R) as 2,565 m in both directions. Nearly three-quarters of takeoffs are towards the west (74% over 12 months). Both runways are wide; they are apart, which is insufficient for the simultaneous use of both runways. During normal operations the northern runway is used as a taxiway, consistent with its original construction (although it was gradually widened).

In October 2018, the airport announced that it was &quot;exploring how to make best use of its existing runways, including the possibility of bringing its existing standby runway into routine use&quot;. One scenario would see 08L/26R used for departing narrow-body aircraft only, while the longer 08R/26L would be used for wide-body take-offs and all landings; widening 08L/26R would also increase the centreline separation slightly. New technology could also be used to increase capacity on the main runway, and, in the longer term, the airport remains interested in constructing a new runway to the south.

In 2023, plans were announced to expand the second runway and make it operational for regular use.

The main runway uses a Category III Instrument Landing System (ILS). The northern runway does not have an ILS; when it is in use, arriving aircraft are radar vectored to intercept an RNAV (GNSS) approach, providing the aircraft is equipped and the operator has approval. This approach is satellite-based and is also available for the main runway. When an RNAV approach is not possible, assistance from the approach controller using surveillance radar, an &quot;SRA approach&quot; is available. This involves heading instructions and altitude callouts supplied by the Air Traffic Controller. On both runways, a continuous descent approach is used to minimise the environmental effects of incoming aircraft, particularly at night.

Night flights are subject to restrictions; between 11 pm and 7 am, noisier aircraft (rated QC/8 and QC/16) may not operate. From 11.30 pm to 6 am (the night quota period) there are three limits: Number of flights, a Quota Count system, limiting total noise permitted and no night QC/4 flights.

Air traffic control services are outsourced. In 2014 a proposed contract award for air traffic control services was suspended due to errors in the airport operator&#x27;s procurement process, which was governed at the time by the European Union&#x27;s rules on procurement in the energy, telecommunications, transport and water sectors. Consideration of the legal case brought by NATS UK discussed whether the court&#x27;s approach to resolving such cases should consider the &quot;American Cyanamid&quot; principles reflected in UK national procurement law or a different &quot;balance of interests&quot; test, as proposed by NATS, which was less likely to allow a proposed contract award where damages paid to a successful challenger might be an adequate legal remedy. Use of the &quot;balance of interests&quot; test was ruled out by Mr Justice Ramsey.

===Security===
The airport is policed by the Gatwick District of Sussex Police. The district is responsible for the entire airport (including aircraft) and, in certain circumstances, aircraft in flight. The 150 officers attached to this district include armed and unarmed officers, and community support officers for minor offences. The airport district counters man-portable surface-to-air missiles (MANPADS) by patrolling in and around the airport and a separate sub-unit has vehicle checks around the airport.

Access to airside portions of the airport is controlled and maintained by the airport&#x27;s team of security officers, regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority. Brook House, an immigration removal centre of Immigration Enforcement, was opened near the airport on 18 March 2009 by the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith.

===Major airlines===
The airport is a base for scheduled airlines British Airways (BA), easyJet, Wizz Air, and charter operators such as TUI Airways. Gatwick is unique among London&#x27;s airports in its representation of the three main airline business models: full service, low-cost and charter. As of October 2016, these respectively accounted for 26.6%, 61.3% and 13.1% of Gatwick&#x27;s seat capacity.

By late 2015, easyJet flew over 100 routes from Gatwick with a fleet of more than 60 aircraft. The airport is the carrier&#x27;s largest base and its 16 million passengers per year accounted for 45% of Gatwick&#x27;s 2013 total (ahead of Gatwick&#x27;s second-largest passenger airline: BA, whose 4.5 million passengers comprised 14% of total passenger traffic in 2011–12).

easyJet, BA and Norwegian Air Shuttle were Gatwick&#x27;s three biggest resident airlines, although in late 2020 Norwegian announced the closure of its base at Gatwick. According to data from Airport Coordination Limited, these three airlines respectively accounted for 43.3%, 19% and 10.5% of airport slots in April 2018. According to this data, by April 2018 Norwegian had overtaken Virgin Atlantic as Gatwick&#x27;s number one transatlantic airline by seat capacity, and BA&#x27;s competitive response to Norwegian&#x27;s growing commercial threat to its transatlantic business would result in Virgin&#x27;s relegation to third position among the airport&#x27;s transatlantic airlines during the 2018 summer timetable period. easyJet, BA and Norwegian collectively accounted for 65.43% of Gatwick&#x27;s total passengers in 2016 (easyJet: 40.37% / 17.4 million; BA: 14.39% / 6.2 million; Norwegian: 10.67% / 4.6 million). As per Official Airline Guide (OAG) data for the week of 29 May 2017, their respective international departure seat capacity shares at the airport for summer 2017 are 42.1%, 15.4% and 9.4%.

In terms of passengers carried easyJet and BA were also among the five largest airlines operating at Gatwick in 2010 (which also included TUI Airways and Thomas Cook Airlines at the time) and the top 10 in 2015. In terms of total scheduled airline seats at Gatwick in 2014, easyJet accounted for 18.36 million, more than two-and-a-half times as many as second-placed BA (7 million) and nearly five times the number offered by third-placed Norwegian Air Shuttle (3.74 million). Using data sourced from the OAG Schedules Analyser, the following changes in the respective departure seat capacity shares of Gatwick&#x27;s three biggest airlines occurred from 2010 to 2015: easyJet&#x27;s share increased from 26.1% in 2010 to 42.1% in 2015; BA&#x27;s share dropped from 18.3% in 2010 to 15% in 2015; Norwegian&#x27;s share rose almost three-fold from less than 3% in 2010 to 8.3% in 2015. easyJet, BA, Norwegian, TUI Airways, Ryanair, Thomas Cook Airlines, Monarch Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, Vueling and Emirates were Gatwick&#x27;s top 10 airlines by share of passengers in 2017.

easyJet&#x27;s acquisition of BA franchise carrier GB Airways in March 2008 increased its share of airport slots to 24% (from 17% in late 2007); the airline became the largest short-haul operator at the airport, accounting for 29% of short-haul passengers. By 2009, BA&#x27;s share of Gatwick slots had fallen to 20% from its peak of 40% in 2001. By 2010, this had declined to 16%. By mid-2012, easyJet had 45% of Gatwick&#x27;s early-morning peak time slots (6 a.m. to 8:55 a.m.).

By 2008, Flybe was Gatwick&#x27;s third-largest airline (accounting for 9% of its slots) and its fastest-growing airline. It became the airport&#x27;s largest domestic operator, carrying 1.2 million passengers in its 2011–12 financial year on eight routes to destinations in the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. In March 2013, the airline announced that it would end operations at Gatwick, citing unsustainably high airport charges and increases in UK Air Passenger Duty. Flybe sold its 25 pairs of daily slots at the airport to easyJet for £20 million. The latter&#x27;s share of Gatwick slots increased to 44% in summer 2014; second-placed BA has held about 16% of the airport&#x27;s slots since 2010. Following the sale of its Gatwick slots to easyJet, Flybe continued to provide the scheduled service between Gatwick and Newquay, as a result of being awarded the contract to fly this route under a four-year Public Service Obligation (PSO), until the flight was subsequently moved from Gatwick to Heathrow Airport in April 2019.

Slots left by the US carriers (and the collapse of Zoom Airlines, Oasis Hong Kong Airlines, XL Airways UK, Sterling Airlines, Monarch Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines, and Adria Airways) were taken by easyJet, Flybe, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. Many full-service airlines have established or resumed operations at the airport, including Air China, Cathay Pacific, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Turkish Airlines, and WestJet. This is part of the airport&#x27;s strategy to attract higher-spending business travellers (countering its dependence on European low-cost and charter markets), increasing year-round capacity utilisation by smoothing peaks and troughs in traffic. Gatwick&#x27;s success in persuading these airlines to launch (or re-launch) routes to overseas destinations important for business and leisure travel was aided by a lack of comparable slots at Heathrow.

On 5 May 2020, Virgin Atlantic announced it would cease operations at Gatwick due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 18 August 2020, Wizz Air announced a new hub at Gatwick Airport. Initially basing their A321 aircraft there along with additional commercial routes to Greece, Italy, Spain, and Malta operating from 22 October 2020, onwards.

In September 2021, the International Airlines Group announced that British Airways would terminate its short- and medium-haul base operations at Gatwick with immediate effect resulting in the cancellation of more than 30 routes. This came after labour negotiations regarding the handover of these operations, most of which were still suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to a newly formed budget subsidiary failed. British Airways continues to serve two domestic destinations, Glasgow and Manchester alongside their long-haul network from Gatwick.

British Airways has now resumed short-haul flights from Gatwick, as a new subsidiary which will be initially operated by British Airways, but will soon be managed under the trading name &quot;BA EuroFlyer&quot;. The company expects this to happen by the autumn of 2022.

===City Place Gatwick===

Gatwick&#x27;s original terminal, the Beehive, is included within the City Place Gatwick office complex together with 1, 2 and 3 City Place. The complex was developed by BAA Lynton. Some airlines have had offices at the Beehive, including BEA/British Airways Helicopters, Jersey Airlines, Caledonian Airways, Virgin Atlantic and GB Airways.
Other airlines which had headquarters on airport property (including office buildings on the site of, or adjacent to, the original 1930s airport) include British Caledonian, British United Airways, CityFlyer Express, Fastjet, Laker Airways and Tradewinds Airways.

===Gatwick Aviation Museum===
Situated to the northwest of the airfield near the village of Charlwood, there is a museum including original items and photographs from Gatwick&#x27;s history, as well as a variety of military aircraft. It is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday all year round.

==Terminals==


The airport has two terminals, South and North, with 65 total gates. Both have shops and restaurants landside and airside, and all areas are accessible to disabled passengers. There are facilities for baby changing and feeding. Business travellers have specialised lounges. The North and South Terminals are connected by a 0.75-mile (1.21 km), elevated, two-way automated people mover landside. They are not connected once past security.

===South Terminal===
South Terminal has 32 gates with jetbridges and 7 remote gates. The official opening of the central pier of what is now the South Terminal, with 11 aircraft stands, was on 9 June 1958. Gatwick was one of the world&#x27;s first airports with an enclosed pier-based terminal, which allowed passengers to walk under cover to waiting areas near the aircraft (with only a short walk outdoors). Another feature of Gatwick&#x27;s new air terminal was its modular design, permitting subsequent, phased expansion. As passenger numbers grew, a circular satellite pier was added to the terminal building. It was connected to the main terminal by the UK&#x27;s first automated people mover system. This replaced the original North Pier dating from 1962; the people mover was subsequently replaced with a walkway and travelators.

The South Terminal was temporarily closed from June 2020, and all airlines normally operating from this terminal were relocated to the North Terminal, owing to the sharp decline in passenger traffic as a result of the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It fully reopened in March 2022. During the time it was not in operation, it was used as a remote filming location for the fourteenth series of the television show &quot;Taskmaster&quot;.

===North Terminal===
North Terminal has 31 gates with jetbridges including three which can support an Airbus A380. Construction began on the North Terminal on land previously earmarked for a second runway in the draft plan of May 1970. This was the largest construction project south of London in the 1980s, costing £200 million. In 1991 a second aircraft pier was added to the North Terminal. On 16 May 2005, the new Pier 6 opened at £110 million, adding 11 pier-served aircraft stands. The pier is linked to the North Terminal&#x27;s main building by the second-largest air passenger bridge in the world, spanning a taxiway and providing passengers with views of the airport and taxiing aircraft.

A large extension to the terminal was opened by former Prime Minister John Major in November 2011.

===Terminal assignments and rearrangements===
As part of a seven-year strategic commercial partnership between Gatwick and EasyJet, the airport proposed several changes to individual airlines&#x27; terminal locations. These would see EasyJet consolidate all its Gatwick operations in the North Terminal, while British Airways and Virgin Atlantic would swap their terminals. Gatwick believes that these terminal moves improve the airport&#x27;s operational efficiency and resilience, as the use of different terminals by EasyJet and British Airways reduces pressure on the North Terminal&#x27;s check-in, security, boarding and ramp areas at peak times. In addition, a terminal swap by Virgin frees up lounge and gate space for BA long-haul passengers in the South Terminal and, unlike BA&#x27;s current short-haul schedules, Virgin&#x27;s long-haul schedules do not clash with EasyJet&#x27;s busy schedule in the North Terminal due to the airlines&#x27; differing peak times.

It was confirmed in January 2015 that British Airways would move all its flights to the South Terminal in November 2016 while all EasyJet flights would be consolidated in the North Terminal at the same time. However, it was decided in February 2016 to postpone the agreed relocation of airlines until 25 January 2017, to avoid operational disruptions over the 2016–17 Christmas season and to give all parties involved enough time to deal with any unforeseen issues ahead of the February 2017 half-term holidays. The relocation of these airlines was accomplished by the revised date of 25 January 2017.
==Airlines and destinations==

The following airlines operate regular scheduled flights to and from Gatwick Airport:

==Traffic and statistics==

===Overview===
In 2015, Gatwick became the first single-runway airport to handle more than 40 million passengers annually. By 2016, EasyJet accounted for over 40% of Gatwick&#x27;s total passengers. When ranked by global passenger traffic, Gatwick is the 35th busiest internationally and the eighth busiest airport in Europe. Gatwick is the world&#x27;s leading low-cost airport and until March 2017 had the world&#x27;s busiest single-use runway, with a maximum of 55 aircraft movements per hour.

===Busiest routes===


===Traffic===
Gatwick handled 186,172 passengers during its first seven months of operation after the 1956–58 reconstruction; the annual number of passengers passing through the airport was 368,000 in 1959 and 470,000 in 1960. Passenger numbers reached one million for the first time during the 1962–63 fiscal year, with British United Airways (BUA) accounting for four-fifths. The 1.5 million mark was exceeded for the first time during the 1966–67 fiscal year. This was also the first time more than half a million scheduled passengers used the airport. Gatwick accommodated two million passengers for the first time during the 1967–68 fiscal year and 3 million in the 1969–70 fiscal year, with BUA accounting for nearly half. By the early 1970s, 5 million passengers used Gatwick each year, with a record 5.7 million during the 1973–74 fiscal year. During that period, British Caledonian accounted for approximately half of all charter passengers and three-fourths of scheduled passengers. Within a decade annual passenger numbers doubled, to 10 million; they doubled again, to over 20 million, by the late 1980s. By the turn of the millennium, Gatwick handled more than 30 million passengers annually.

46.1 million passengers passed through Gatwick in 2018, an increase of 1.1% over the previous year. North Atlantic and other long-haul traffic recorded increases over the previous year of 24.4% and 12.7% to 4.04 million and 4.65 million passengers, respectively. UK, European charter, Irish and European scheduled passenger traffic recorded decreases over the previous year of 8.7%, 5.7%, 1.1% and 0.9% to 3.73 million, 2.88 million, 1.67 million and 29.11 million, respectively. Air transport movements decreased by 0.7% to 283,926. Cargo volume increased by 16.1% to 112,676 metric tonnes.

Compared with a year earlier, January to March 2019 passenger numbers increased by 4% to 9.675 million (an increase of 374,700 over January to March 2018). The following changes were recorded amongst individual passenger traffic categories: North Atlantic traffic +15.3% (784,200 passengers); European scheduled traffic +3.9% (5.649 million passengers); other long-haul traffic +3.2% (1.277 million passengers); European charter traffic +2.1% (710,900 passengers); Irish traffic +1.6% (412,000 passengers) and UK traffic -0.2% (841,700 passengers). Air transport movements increased by 3.3% to 62,392. Cargo volume increased by 7.2% to 27,390 metric tonnes, which was driven by a 7.5% increase in overall long-haul passenger traffic. The growing popularity of the GatwickConnects flight connections assistance service provided by the airport for self-connecting passengers was driven by additional passengers changing flights at Gatwick whose journey originated in Edinburgh (+80%), Jersey (+58%) and Belfast (+50%).

==Ground transport==

Gatwick has set goals of 40% public transport use by the time annual passenger traffic reaches 40 million (in 2015) and 45% by the time it reaches 45 million.

The airport is accessible from a motorway spur road at junction 9A of the M23, which links to the main M23 motorway east at junction 9. The M23 connects with London&#x27;s orbital motorway, the M25, north; this provides access to much of Greater London, the South East and beyond, and the M23 is the main route for traffic to (and from) the airport. Gatwick is also accessible from the A23, which serves Horley and Redhill to the north and Crawley and Brighton to the south. The A217 provides access northwards to the town of Reigate. The airport has long- and short-stay car parks at the airport and off-site, although these are often full in summer. Local restrictions limit parking at Gatwick.

===Rail===

Gatwick Airport railway station is located adjacent to the South Terminal and has served the airport since 1958. It is located on the Brighton Main Line, and is mainly served by Southern, Thameslink, and Gatwick Express. It also receives a half-hourly service operated by Great Western Railway via the North Downs Line.

To the south, Southern, Thameslink, and Gatwick Express all provide direct connections to Brighton. Southern also provides connections to Eastbourne, Littlehampton, Bognor Regis, and Portsmouth Harbour.

To the north, Thameslink provides connections to London Bridge, Gatwick Express provides non-stopping connections to London Victoria, and Southern provides connections to both stations. Thameslink trains continue further north through the Thameslink Core to St Pancras International, Bedford, Peterborough, and Cambridge. Great Western Railway also provides a half-hourly service to Reading via Guildford.

The station provides single-change connections to Heathrow Airport and Luton Airport via northbound Thameslink services. Heathrow Airport can be reached by changing to the Elizabeth line at Farringdon, whilst Luton Airport can be reached by the Luton DART station at Luton Airport Parkway.

London Oyster Cards and contactless cards are accepted on all rail routes from Gatwick Airport into London.

===Bus===
National Express Coaches operates coaches to Heathrow Airport, London Stansted Airport and cities and towns throughout the region and country. Oxford Bus Company operates direct services to Oxford, and EasyBus operates mini-coaches from both terminals to Earls Court and West Brompton.

Local buses connect the North and South Terminals with Crawley, Horley, Redhill, Horsham and Caterham. Services are offered by Metrobus, including Metrobus&#x27;s Fastway services operated on a partly guided bus rapid transit system which was the first of its kind to be built outside a major city.

===Bike===
Route 21 of the National Cycle Network passes under the South Terminal, allowing virtually traffic-free cycling and walking northwards to Horley and southwards to Three Bridges and Crawley. A goods-style lift runs between the terminal and ground level (labelled &quot;Lift to Cycle Route&quot;) near Zone L.

===Terminal transfer===

The airport&#x27;s North and South Terminals are connected by a , elevated, two-way automated people mover track. The transit shuttle normally consists of two automatic, three-car, driverless trains. Although colloquially known as a &quot;monorail&quot;, the shuttle instead runs on a dual, concrete track with rubber tyres. The transit is land side, and besides linking the two terminals also links the North terminal to the airport railway station.

The shuttle opened in 1987, along with the North Terminal, and initially used Adtranz C-100 people-mover cars which remained in operation until September 2009, by which time they had travelled a total of 2.5 million miles (4 million km). Gatwick began upgrading its shuttle service in April 2008, with a bus replacement service in place from September 2009. A new operating system and shuttle cars (six Bombardier CX-100 vehicles) were installed, and the guideway and transit stations were refurbished at a total cost of £45 million. The system re-opened on 1 July 2010, two months ahead of schedule; it featured live journey information and sensory technology to count the number of passengers at stations.

An earlier transit system, that opened in 1983 to link the main terminal (now the South Terminal) to the (then new) circular satellite pier, was the UK&#x27;s first automated people-moving system. This system has since been replaced by a walkway-and-moving walkway link, although the remains of the elevated guideway are still visible.

==Expansion proposals==

Gatwick has been included in many reviews of airport capacity in southeastern England. Expansion options have included a third terminal and a second runway; although an agreement not to build a second runway was made in 1979 with West Sussex County Council, that agreement expired by its terms after 40 years. Expanded operations would allow Gatwick to handle more passengers than Heathrow does today, with a new terminal between two wide-spaced runways. This would complement or replace the South Terminal, depending on expected future traffic.

Airport management&#x27;s proposal for a second runway (south of the existing runway and airport boundary) was unveiled in July 2013. This was shortlisted for further consideration by the Airports Commission in December 2013, and the commission&#x27;s final report was published in July 2015. Another proposal would extend the North Terminal south, with a passenger bridge in the area currently occupied by aircraft stands without jet bridges. Gatwick&#x27;s draft master plan (released for consultation on 13 October 2011) dropped the passenger-bridge plan in favour of a mid-field satellite (next to the control tower) linking to the North Terminal as part of an expanded 2030 single-runway, two-terminal airport.

In late 2011, the Department for Transport (DfT) also began a feasibility study for a high-speed rail link between Gatwick and Heathrow as part of a plan combining the airports into a &quot;collective&quot; or &quot;virtual hub&quot;, Heathwick. The scheme envisaged a high-speed rail route parallel to the M25, covering in 15 minutes. Trains would have reached speeds of , and passengers would have passed through immigration (or check-in) only once. Reactions to this proposal were largely negative. Another proposal for a high-speed railway link to Heathrow, HS4Air, as part of a scheme to link the High Speed 1 and High Speed 2 railway lines and connect regional cities in Britain to the Channel Tunnel, was rejected in 2018. 

On 1 July 2015, the Airports Commission submitted its final report, recommending the expansion of Heathrow Airport as opposed to Gatwick. Whilst the commission recognised Gatwick&#x27;s benefits and relatively fewer environmental consequences than Heathrow, they felt the economic benefits of Gatwick vs. Heathrow were not as great, nor as broad-ranging. Gatwick disputed the findings.

On 9 September 2021, GAL opened its first public consultation to carry out major works at the runway to increase its capacity from 64 million passengers a year to 75 million passengers a year by moving the northern &quot;emergency&quot; runway to the north to meet international standards for dual runway use. Airport management plans to use this runway only for take-offs by all but the largest aircraft. It hoped to receive approval in 2024, with the main works taking 4 years to complete, and 13 years to be fully complete. Works would also involve a new pier, hotels, terminal expansion and highway improvements including flyovers of the M23 Spur / A23 Airport Way at the terminal roundabouts. Planning permission for the runway realignment was formally requested in July 2023. The plan would cost around £2.2 billion, financed by private investors rather than government backing, and would be operational within around five years.

On 27 February 2025, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced that she was &quot;minded to approve&quot; the proposals, subject to noise mitigation. A period of additional consultation was announced, pending a final decision in October 2025.

==Accidents and incidents==
* 15 September 1936 – A British Airways Ltd de Havilland DH 86 on a night mail flight to Germany crashed on takeoff, killing the airline&#x27;s chief pilot and two crew members.
* November 1936 – A British Airways Ltd Fokker F 12 crashed in a wood south of Gatwick on its final approach to the airport under a low ceiling in poor visibility, killing both pilots and seriously injuring the flight engineer.
* 17 February 1959 – A Turkish Airlines Vickers Viscount 794D (registration: TC-SEV) on an international charter flight crashed in heavy fog at Newdigate, Surrey, on its approach to Gatwick after striking trees. Fourteen of the 24 on board died, and Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes was amongst the survivors.
* 5 January 1969 – A Boeing 727-113C (registration: YA-FAR) operating as Ariana Afghan Airlines Flight 701 arriving from Frankfurt Airport, Germany, crashed into a house in Fernhill (near Horley, Surrey) in low visibility. The flaps were not extended to maintain flight at final-approach speed. 48 of the 62 on board died, in addition to two on the ground.
* 28 January 1972 – A British Caledonian Vickers VC10-1109 (registration: G-ARTA) with no passengers aboard sustained severe structural damage as a result of a hard landing at Gatwick at the end of a short ferry flight from Heathrow, where the aircraft had been diverted due to fog at Gatwick. After touching down runway 08 and applying spoilers and reverse thrust, the aircraft became airborne again, bounced twice and landed heavily. This resulted in a burst front wheel tyre, a separated wheel and a crumpled fuselage (immediately in front of and behind the wings). A survey of the aircraft&#x27;s damage revealed that its airframe was bent out of shape, requiring extensive repairs to restore airworthiness. Since the repairs were not cost-effective, the airline&#x27;s management decided to cannibalise the aircraft for spare parts before scrapping it at Gatwick in 1975.
* 20 July 1975 – A British Island Airways (BIA) Handley Page Dart Herald 201 (registration: G-APWF) was involved in a runway accident while departing on a scheduled flight to Guernsey. The aircraft lifted off from runway 26 after a ground run of and appeared airborne for (with its landing gear retracting) before the rear underside of the fuselage settled back onto the runway and brought the aircraft to a stop. An investigation concluded that the landing gear was retracted before the aircraft had become established in a climb and the flap setting and takeoff speed were incorrect. Although the aircraft incurred substantial damage, none of the 45 occupants were hurt.
* 29 December 2014 – A Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747-400 (Registration: G-VROM) suffered a loss of hydraulic fluid whilst en route to Las Vegas. Shortly after departure, an alarm prompted the crew to return to Gatwick, when they discovered that an improperly installed actuator had caused the right wing landing gear to not deploy. The aircraft successfully landed on 3 main landing-gear bogies and was returned to service on 11 January 2015.
*19–21 December 2018 – A major disruption to the airport was caused by reports of drone sightings close to the runway. The runway was closed and all flights were suspended for about six hours on 19 December. The airport reopened at 03:01 the next morning until another reported sighting prompted another closing about 45 minutes later. As of 00:15 on 21 December, the airport was still closed with about 110,000 passengers and 760 flights affected. Officials called the drone flying a &quot;deliberate act of disruption&quot;, but did not classify it as terrorism. The army was deployed to assist the police in resolving the incident. The runway reopened with limited capacity around 06:00 that day. Authorities suspended flights again from 17:10 to 18:23 on 21 December. Later that day a man and a woman were arrested in connection with the incident; the pair were released without charge on 23 December with Sussex Police saying that they &quot;are no longer suspects&quot;.
*26 February 2020 – a Titan Airways Airbus A321-211 reported engine surge after takeoff. A few moments later, the other engine stalled. The aircraft landed safely at Gatwick eleven minutes after takeoff. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch determined fuel contamination following defective maintenance had gone undetected for two days and caused the incident. Safety recommendations were made to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and changes were made by organisations including Airbus and the International Air Transport Association.

<doc id="101362" wikidata="Q1814449" url="?curid=101362" title="World Conference against Racism">
<text>The World Conference Against Racism (WCAR) is a series of international events organized by UNESCO to promote struggle against racism ideologies and behaviours. Five conferences have been held so far, in 1978, 1983, 2001, 2009 and 2021. Founded after World War II and the Holocaust as a dependent body of the United Nations, UNESCO started as soon as it was created to promote scientific studies concerning ethnic groups and their diffusion in public opinion to dispel pseudo-scientific rationalizations of racism. One of its first published works was &quot;The Race Question&quot; in 1950, signed by various internationally renowned scholars.

== 1978 conference ==
The 1978 World Conference Against Racism was held in Geneva, Switzerland. A major focus on the conference was South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policies of racial segregation and discrimination. This included condemnation of Israel–South Africa relations (in particular economic and military cooperation), a request that the United Nations Security Council consider &quot;imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions&quot; on South Africa and other &quot;racist regimes of southern Africa&quot;, and other criticism of apartheid in South Africa. There was also a declaration and program of action which resulted from the conference which condemned racial superiority, racism, and racial discrimination, and called for educational resources to promote &quot;mutual understanding between all human beings and demonstrate...the...basis of ethnic and racial equality&quot;, among other statements.

== 1983 conference ==

The 1983 World Conference Against Racism was also held in Geneva, Switzerland.

== 2001 conference ==
The 2001 conference was held in Durban, South Africa, under UN auspices, from 31 August until 8 September 2001. Former Irish president Mary Robinson, then the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, presided as secretary-general.

Entitled &quot;World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance&quot;, the conference was discussing unfair treatment of one group against another. Significant time was focused specifically on Israeli treatment of Palestinians, treating violations of human rights and genocide in other parts of the world secondarily.

The 2001 meeting was marked by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery, and coincided with attacks on Israel and anti-Israel demonstrations at a parallel conference of non-governmental organizations. The U.S. and Israel withdrew midway through the conference over a draft resolution that, in their opinion, singled out Israel for criticism and likened Zionism to racism. The European Union also refused to accept wording by Arab states criticizing Israel for &quot;racist practices.&quot;

Also in the conference, African countries, led by Nigeria and Zimbabwe, and African-American NGOs wanted individual apologies from each of the countries responsible for slavery, recognition of it as a crime against humanity, and reparations called as such. The Europeans pulled together behind the UK and the best the Africans could get was a call for support for the New African Initiative, debt relief, funds to combat AIDS, the recovery of stolen government funds transferred to the West by former dictators and their cohorts, and an end to the trafficking in people. But the word &#x27;reparations&#x27; did not survive.

== 2009 conference ==
The 2009 World Conference Against Racism was held in Geneva, Switzerland. Canada, Israel, the United States of America, New Zealand, Germany, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland and, after some initial skepticism, Australia announced they would not participate in the conference.

Mark Mardell of the BBC news reported: On the Monday the Conference was to begin, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini (who was until last year the European Commissioner for security and justice) had told the Italian newspaper &quot;Il Giornale&quot; that Europe&#x27;s failure to agree on a common approach was &quot;a very serious mistake, because it shows our inability, despite all the words uttered in this connection, to come up with at least a lowest common denominator on a basic problem: namely the struggle against discrimination, on behalf of which we in Brussels so often speak out&quot;.

Frattini continued, &quot;I should imagine that a compromise was preferred at any price. And this, despite the fact that in the documents prepared for the rendezvous in Geneva, apart from a few minor improvements, a basic approach has been maintained equating Israel with a racist country rather than a democracy. There are still unacceptable phrases which, if there had been a smidgen of consistency with what was said at the EU ministers&#x27; meeting, should have convinced people to forgo attending the conference – as we have decided to do, and as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and The Netherlands have decided to do.&quot; (Mark Mardell, BBC News)

New Zealand&#x27;s Foreign Minister Murray McCully said he was not satisfied that the wording of the review would prevent the conference from &quot;descending into the same kind of rancorous and unproductive debate that took place in 2001,&quot; and he reported that he was concerned that it could be used by Muslim countries to criticize Israel and to limit free speech when it comes to criticizing their religion. (reported by the Associated Press on 20 April)

On the opening day of the conference, France said that Europeans would walk out if Ahmadinejad made any anti-Semitic remarks. &quot;We will have to be very clear. We will not tolerate any slips,&quot; French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner told France Info. &quot;If he utters racist or anti-Semitic accusations, we will leave the room immediately.&quot;

Germany had decided to stay away from the meeting amid western concerns that the event may take on anti-Semitic overtones, a senior official confirmed in Berlin Thursday.

In his opening address, Secretary-General of UN Ban Ki-moon said, &quot;Some nations who by rights should be helping us to forge a path to a better future are not here. Outside these halls, interest groups of many political and ideological stripes shout against one another in acrimony.&quot;

Later in the day, about 40 delegates walked out during Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s speech after he described Israel as a &quot;racist government&quot; and attacked the creation of the state of Israel. France, which had warned of a walkout, described it as &quot;hate speech&quot;, the BBC reported.

The walkout was a public relations disaster for the United Nations, which had hoped the conference would be a shining example of what the UN is supposed to do best: uniting to combat injustice in the world, said the BBC&#x27;s Imogen Foulkes in Geneva. Her colleague Jeremy Paxman described the walkout as a &quot;stunt&quot;, arguing that people should have the right to criticise Zionism.

President Ahmadinejad, the only major leader to attend the conference, said Jewish migrants from Europe and the United States had been sent to the Middle East after World War II &quot;in order to establish a racist government in the occupied Palestine&quot;. He continued, through an interpreter: &quot;And in fact, in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in Europe, they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in Palestine.&quot; French Ambassador Jean-Baptiste Mattei said: &quot;As soon as he started to address the question of the Jewish people and Israel, we had no reason to stay in the room.&quot;

British ambassador Peter Gooderham, also among those who left, said Ahmadinejad&#x27;s comments were &quot;offensive and inflammatory&quot;. &quot;Such outrageous anti-Semitic remarks should have no place in a UN anti-racism forum&quot;, he announced to gathered reporters. (BBC News)

A webcast of Ahmadinejad&#x27;s speech was made available by the United Nations, and the &quot;Foreign Policy Journal&quot;, an online news publisher, rushed out a transcript.
== 2021 conference ==

In September 2021, the UN General Assembly commemorated the 20th anniversary of its 2001 conference by pledging to redouble its anti-racist efforts. The event was boycotted by Albania, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Estonia, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Moldova, Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States and Uruguay. The European Union also did not participate or speak at the commemoration.

<text>Route 42 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey within the Camden area. It runs from an intersection with U.S. Route 322 (US 322) and County Route 536 Spur (CR 536 Spur) in Monroe Township, Gloucester County, to an intersection with Interstate 76 (I-76) and I-295 in Bellmawr, Camden County. The southern portion of Route 42 is a four-lane divided highway and one of several highways comprising the Black Horse Pike, a road that runs from Camden to Atlantic City. The northern portion is part of a six- to eight-lane freeway referred to locally as the North–South Freeway (or simply the 42 Freeway) that connects the Atlantic City Expressway to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge (via I-76 and I-676). Major junctions along the route include the Atlantic City Expressway and the southern terminus of Route 168 in Turnersville, Route 168 in Blackwood, and Route 41 and Route 55 in Deptford Township.

Route 42 was originally designated in 1927 to run along the Black Horse Pike between Ferry Avenue in Camden and the present US 40/US 322 split in the McKee City section of Hamilton Township, Atlantic County. In 1953, the southern terminus was cut back to its current terminus in the Williamstown section of Monroe Township to avoid the concurrency it shared with US 322. After the completion of the North–South Freeway between Bellmawr and Turnersville in 1959, Route 42 was moved to this freeway, and the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168.

The freeway portion of Route 42 has been improved many times. Construction work has commenced on a project known as the &quot;I-295/I-76/Route 42 Direct Connection,&quot; which is reconstructing the dangerous and congested Route 42/I-295/I-76 interchange in Bellmawr.

== Route description ==
===Black Horse Pike===
Route 42 begins at an intersection with US 322 and CR 536 Spur in Monroe Township, Gloucester County, where it heads to the north on the Black Horse Pike. For the first portion of the route, Route 42 is a divided four–lane arterial highway that intersects various local roads. Some intersections along this section feature jughandles. There are also many businesses lining the highway. The route crosses CR 689 (Berlin-Cross Keys Road) and enters Washington Township. It then intersects the northern terminus of CR 555 (Tuckahoe Road). After the intersection with CR 555, Route 42 intersects three more county routes: CR 655 (Fries Mill Road), CR 639 (Ganttown Road), and CR 651 (Greentree Road). The route meets the western terminus of the Atlantic City Expressway at an interchange, Route 168 continues to the north on the Black Horse Pike, and Route 42 becomes the six–lane North–South Freeway.

===North–South Freeway===

Upon becoming the North–South Freeway, Route 42 crosses into Gloucester Township, Camden County and comes to the first numbered exit for CR 705, which provides access to Route 168. Following that, the freeway reaches the CR 673 (College Drive) interchange, serving Camden County College to the east and the Gloucester Premium Outlets to the west. CR 534 interchanges with a southbound exit and northbound entrance and then Coles Road interchanges with a northbound exit and southbound entrance. Next, Route 42 encounters Exits 9B and 10A for Route 168. Exit 9B serves northbound Route 168 and provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike, and Exit 10A serves southbound Route 168. CR 681 interchanges after Route 168, with a southbound exit and northbound entrance, and Route 42 enters Gloucester County again in Deptford Township after crossing the South Branch of Big Timber Creek.

In Deptford Township, Route 41 interchanges with a northbound exit and an entrance in both directions. Past this interchange, CR 544 interchanges with a southbound exit and an entrance in both directions. Both of these interchanges provide access to the Deptford Mall and, in the case of the Route 41 interchange, to Route 55 from northbound Route 42 since the northbound lanes have no direct access to Route 55. Route 42 meets the northern terminus of the Route 55 freeway at Exit 13 with a southbound exit and northbound entrance, where it widens to eight lanes. Route 42 crosses the Big Timber Creek into Runnemede, Camden County, where it passes over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange. The freeway then enters Bellmawr, where it comes to a northbound exit to southbound I-295 and a southbound entrance from northbound I-295, before it features right-in/right-out ramps with Leaf Avenue, that provide access to CR 753 (Creek Road). Route 42 then continues north to its terminus at I-295 where the North–South Freeway becomes I-76, which heads to Camden and Philadelphia.
The North–South Freeway portion of Route 42 is a major route for daily commuters from southern New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, via the Walt Whitman Bridge and Ben Franklin Bridge and weekend commuters from southeastern Pennsylvania to the southern Jersey Shore via Route 55 and the Atlantic City Expressway. Even though Route 42 ends at I-295, the North–South Freeway is sometimes called &quot;Route 42&quot; all the way to the I-76/I-676 split.

Snow removal, litter control, and landscaping of Route 42 between the end of the Atlantic City Expressway and I-295 is performed by the South Jersey Transportation Authority.

==History==
In 1927, Route 42 was legislated to run along the Black Horse Pike, a road that traces its origins back to 1855. In that year, the Camden and Blackwoodstown Turnpike Company was established by entrepreneurs who had helped create the White Horse Pike to build a gravel road that would run from Camden south to Blackwoodtown and eventually to Atlantic City, from Ferry Avenue in Camden to Route 48 (now US 40) in McKee City. 

By 1941, US 322 was assigned to follow the routing of Route 42 between Williamstown and McKee City. 
With the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, which eliminated long concurrencies between U.S. Routes and State Routes, the southern terminus of Route 42 was cut back to Williamstown to avoid the concurrency with US 322.

The North–South Freeway portion of Route 42 was originally planned as a parkway in 1932 that would run from the Ben Franklin Bridge in Camden to Atlantic City; however, this proposal never materialized. In the late 1940s, the North–South Freeway was proposed by the New Jersey State Highway Department to run from the Ben Franklin Bridge to Turnersville. In the early 1950s, right-of-way for the freeway was acquired and actual construction of the freeway followed. The Route 42 freeway opened between I-295 in Bellmawr and the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood in 1958. It opened between the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood and Turnersville in 1959. With the completion of the North–South Freeway portion of Route 42, the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168.

In 1965, the freeway was widened to six lanes for most of its length with the northernmost part being widened to eight lanes due to the completion of the Atlantic City Expressway and its interchange with the road. 

The route had its interchange with Route 55 open in 1985, when the Route 55 Freeway was opened from Route 42 to Route 41 to the south. 

Between 1996 and August 1999, the route was widened to eight lanes between I-295 and Route 55 in Deptford Township. 

In 2000, the interchanges with Route 41 and CR 544 in Deptford were rebuilt at a cost of $13 million to improve commuter travel the area. 

In October 2003, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) installed exit tabs along the freeway portion of Route 42. 

On August 27, 2010, an interchange opened at CR 673 (College Drive), providing better access to Camden County College. These replaced a pair of truck pullover areas.

NJDOT had planned a project to address the missing connections between I-295 and Route 42 to provide an easier connection between the Delaware Valley and points south to Atlantic City and vice versa. This project, dubbed the I-295/Route 42 Missing Moves, would provide connections from I-295 northbound to Route 42 southbound and Route 42 northbound to I-295 southbound by constructing two ramps just south of the I-295/I-76/Route 42 interchange. Construction began in March 2020, and the ramps opened to traffic on November 28, 2023.

==Future==

In 2013, NJDOT broke ground on a project to construct a straighter roadway for I-295 near the Route 42 interchange. This project, dubbed the I-295/I-76/Route 42 Direct Connection, will reconstruct the dangerous and congested Route 42/I-295/I-76 interchange, which currently requires traffic on I-295 to use ramps that merge onto the North–South Freeway for a short distance, among a series of other indirect connections. In 2007, &quot;Alternative D&quot; for the reconstructed interchange was selected, calling for I-295 to cross over the North–South Freeway. This interchange was projected to cost $900 million (equivalent to $ in ). The project is being constructed in four phases and was originally scheduled to be complete in 2021. However, delays in construction, including the collapse of a retaining wall on March 25, 2021, pushed the expected completion date to 2028.

On May 12, 2009, New Jersey Governor Jon S. Corzine and the Delaware River Port Authority, the agency which manages the PATCO Speedline, announced plans for a Camden-Philadelphia BRT (bus rapid transit system) along the Route 42 freeway and the adjacent Route 55 freeway as part of a comprehensive transportation plan for South Jersey that would include a diesel light rail line called the Glassboro–Camden Line between Camden and Glassboro, improvements to NJ Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Line, and enhanced connections to the Atlantic City International Airport.

There have been suggestions to construct an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike.

<text>Route 44 is a state highway located in Gloucester County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs from Barker Avenue in Bridgeport to Interstate 295 (I-295)/U.S. Route 130 (US 130) in Thorofare. The route, which is mostly a two-lane undivided road, passes through the communities of Gibbstown and Paulsboro in the northern part of the county, a short distance south of the Delaware River. Route 44 generally runs a short distance to the north of I-295/US 130 for much of its length.

In 1923, Route 17S was legislated along the current route followed by Route 44 today, running between Penns Grove and Westville. The only portion of Route 17S ever built ran from Penns Grove to Salem. Route 44 was designated in 1927 to replace Route 17S between Penns Grove and Westville. By the 1940s, Route 44 was extended south to Salem and US 130 was designated concurrent with the route north of Penns Grove. Several spurs of Route 44 had existed or were planned prior to 1953, including Route S44, which ran concurrent with US 322 to the ferry between Bridgeport and Chester, Pennsylvania; Route S44A, a never-built bypass of Camden; and Route 44T, which was to run from a tunnel under the Delaware River in Paulsboro east to Route 42. In 1953, Route 44 was replaced by US 130 north of Deepwater and by Route 49 south of there. After two bypasses were built for US 130 around Carneys Point and between Bridgeport and Westville, Route 44 was redesignated along the former US 130. After I-295 was completed in the 1960s, US 130 returned to its original alignment in Carneys Point and replaced that portion of Route 44.

== Route description ==

Route 44 begins at an intersection with Main Street and Barker Avenue in the community of Bridgeport in Logan Township, heading to the east on Crown Point Road, a two-lane undivided road. Shortly after beginning, the route heads through wooded areas a short distance to the north of Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Penns Grove Secondary and intersects County Route 671 (CR 671). The road turns northeast and comes to an interchange with US 130 and continues closely parallel to the railroad line as it passes through more rural areas with some homes, coming to a junction with CR 684 and Flood Gate Road, the latter of which heads northwest to provide access to Bridgeport Speedway. Route 44 enters Greenwich Township upon crossing the marshy Repaupo Creek and becomes a local road called West Broad Street. The route passes over the railroad tracks and continues east into residential and commercial areas of Gibbstown, intersecting CR 607/CR 673 and CR 680 within the town.
At the intersection with CR 653, Route 44 enters Paulsboro and passes more developed areas, soon meeting CR 678. The route intersects CR 667 in the center of Paulsboro before crossing the Mantua Creek on a lift bridge and entering wetlands within West Deptford Township. Here, the road heads into a mix of rural lands and development, crossing CR 656 and the Little Mantua Creek. Route 44 intersects the Mid-Atlantic Parkway, which provides access to I-295 and US 130 a short distance to the south, before continuing into inhabited areas. Here, the road crosses the Conrail line and CR 643. The route becomes a four-lane road and has access ramps to and from southbound I-295/US 130 prior to coming to a crossroads with CR 640 in Thorofare. Past CR 640, the route closely parallels I-295/US 130 and crosses Woodbury Creek. Route 44 passes a mobile home park before coming to an end at cul-de-sac that has an access ramp to southbound Route 44 from southbound I-295/US 130.

== History ==

What is now Route 44 was originally legislated as Route 17S in 1923, a route that was to run from Penns Grove to Westville. By 1927, however, the only portion of Route 17S that had existed was a road that ran from Penns Grove south to Salem. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering that occurred that year, Route 44 was designated to run from Penns Grove to Westville, replacing what had been legislated as Route 17S. By the end of the 1930s, Route 44 was extended south from Penns Grove to Salem and US 130 was also designated along with Route 44 north of Penns Grove by 1941.

Prior to 1953, several spurs of Route 44 existed or were planned. Route S44 was designated in 1939 as a connection from Route 44 in Bridgeport to the ferry across the Delaware River to Chester, Pennsylvania, and was concurrent with US 322. The S44 designation was removed in 1953 to avoid the concurrency with US 322. In 1974, the Commodore Barry Bridge was built, bypassing the ferry, and the old alignment of US 322 became Route 324. Route S44A was planned in 1938 as an eastern bypass of Camden from Route 45 in Brooklawn to Route 40 (now Route 70) and Route 41 in Delaware Township (now Cherry Hill), mostly along what is now CR 551. The bypass was never built, although part of what would have been the bypass north of Haddonfield is now Route 41. Route 44T was planned in 1938 as an approach to a never-built tunnel under the Delaware River near Paulsboro. Originally, the route was to run from the tunnel east to the intersection of Route 41 and Route 47 in Deptford Township. In 1939, the planned route was extended east to Route 42 between Blackwood and Williamstown.
In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 44 was replaced by US 130 north of the Delaware Memorial Bridge approach in Deepwater and by Route 49 south of there. However, US 130 was moved to new freeway alignments around Carneys Point and between Bridgeport and Westville. The bypassed alignments of US 130, originally unnumbered, eventually became Route 44. After I-295 was built in the 1960s, it bypassed the portion of the US 130 freeway in Bridgeport and was designated along the US 130 freeway north to Westville and around Carneys Point. US 130 was moved back onto its old alignment in Carneys Point, replacing that portion of Route 44.

<text>Kids Incorporated (also known as Kids Inc.) is an American children&#x27;s television program that began production in the mid-1980s and continued airing into the mid-1990s. It was largely a youth-oriented program with musical performances as an integral part of every episode. The pilot episode was shot on September 1, 1983, and the series aired in syndication from September 1, 1984, to December 26, 1985, and on the Disney Channel from November 3, 1986, to January 9, 1994. Reruns aired on the Disney Channel until May 30, 1996.

==Plot==
The show revolves around a group of children and teenagers who performed in their own rock group called Kids Incorporated. They struggled to deal with issues ranging from crushes to peer pressure to child abuse, while performing regularly at a local former music club called The P*lace, which was really called The Palace, but the first &quot;a&quot; in the sign burned out and was never replaced. The action took place on abstract &quot;stagey&quot; sets and the plots involved many fantasy elements, such as the group meeting a robot (Season 1, Episode 10), a runaway princess (Season 1, Episode 6) and even a wise-cracking bicycle (Season 1, Episode 17). In addition to their performances on stage, the group would break into song when they were off-stage.

==Cast and characters==
For many of the cast members, dancers and musicians, the show was the beginning of a successful career in the entertainment industry. The most visible stars are: 
* Renee Sands and Stacy &quot;Fergie&quot; Ferguson, both of whom were founding members of pop trio Wild Orchid. Fergie later joined the Grammy Award-winning group the Black Eyed Peas, then launched her successful solo career. During her tenure on &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;, she went from being the youngest to the oldest and holds the record for the longest run at six seasons, including the pilot. 
* Martika (a.k.a. Marta Marrero) became a singer with two hit studio records in the late 1980s-early 1990s (&quot;Toy Soldiers&quot;, &quot;Thy Will Be Done&quot;); she began using the mononym Martika billing during her time on the series.
* Mario Lopez (&quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, &quot;Pacific Blue&quot;, &quot;Extra&quot;, and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;) – Lopez appeared as a background dancer and musician throughout the series.
* Eric Balfour (&quot;24&quot;, &quot;Haven&quot;, &quot;Skyline&quot;)
* Jennifer Love Hewitt, who was credited simply as &quot;Love Hewitt&quot; (&quot;Party of Five&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, &quot;Heartbreakers&quot; &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, and &quot;9-1-1&quot;) 
* Brian Friedman (bass guitarist, keyboards, keytar) – 1991–1994
* Brian Poth (keytarist, bass guitar, tambourine) – 1987–1988
* Shanice Wilson (keyboards, vocals) – 1984
* Rahsaan Patterson gained experience as a backup vocalist for several artists including Brandy Norwood and Tevin Campbell.

===Guest stars===
Guest stars included both established celebrities and newcomers. Gwen Verdon, Kathy Johnson, Barry Williams, Florence Henderson (both former stars of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;), Billy Blanks, David Hasselhoff, John Franklin, Ryan Bollman, Christian Hoff, Paul Rodriguez, Brian Robbins, and Ruth Buzzi were among those who appeared during the run of the show. Young actors who guest starred on it included Brittany Murphy (1992), Scott Wolf, Audra Lee (2 episodes), R.J. Williams, Jason Hervey, and Jeff Cohen (Chunk from &quot;The Goonies&quot;).

==Episodes==
==Music==
Music was an integral part of the show and five songs were included in every episode. The musical variety ranged over a number of genres released from the 1960s onward. While these numbers were usually performed onstage in the context of a concert at The P*lace, they were also occasionally used to illustrate a character&#x27;s internal monologue or conflict. The vocal responsibilities were shared by all five (or six) singers; every cast member was given an opportunity to perform featured or solo songs throughout the course of the season.

Each episode consisted of one original number and generally five previously recorded songs by recognized artists. Artists and songs ranged from the 1950s to the 1990s. The original songs were written by the hired composers of the show. Depending on the year those composers were Michael Cruz, Andrew R. Powell, Craig Sharmat, and others.

Due to the age of both the performers and the target demographic, lyrics with objectionable content were generally edited out of the songs and replaced with more appropriate language such as &quot;Jump Around&quot; by House of Pain and &quot;Hip Hop Hooray&quot; by Naughty by Nature. However, occasionally songs were performed as written, slightly objectionable lyrics intact. Examples of uncensored songs that were presented on the series include &quot;Dancing with Myself&quot; by Billy Idol (&quot;The Storybook House&quot; episode, 1990), &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; by Fleetwood Mac (1988), &quot;Prove Your Love&quot; by Taylor Dayne (although this had a slight edit on the chorus as &quot;I wanna see your body dance with mine&quot;), and &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; by Michael Jackson (1990).

==Production and broadcast history==
The original pilot for the show was produced in 1983 and shopped to several networks by creators Thomas W. Lynch and Gary Biller.

The show was not picked up by a major network, but, distributed by MGM/UA Entertainment Co. Television, began a syndicated run on September 1, 1984. The original four cast members, Stacy Ferguson, Marta Marrero, Renee Sands, and Jerry Sharell, were joined by Rahsaan Patterson and a company of five backup dancers. Sharell left after the first season, in part over unhappiness with the show&#x27;s often bizarre and outlandish storylines.

As with most syndicated productions its scheduling was based on local stations rather than being offered universally at one time across the country. Some stations aired it on a weekday near prime time, while others had it as a weekend-only offering that could air as early as 6:30 a.m. Due to its overall unsettled schedule, ratings were never truly steady, and the show was cancelled on December 26, 1985. Reruns aired on CBN (now Freeform) from 1985 to 1986.

It was due to the positive ratings from the CBN reruns that in summer 1986, the show was given a second chance when the Disney Channel acquired the rights to it. It resumed production with the same cast (minus Sharell), and new episodes began airing on November 3, 1986. Disney&#x27;s buyout package also included the entire syndicated run, and as Disney Channel has never carried traditional commercial breaks, the episodes were re-edited to remove any advertising-related continuity to become continuous episodes, which was also advantageous to later home video releases. Its main timeslot on the Disney Channel was 5 p.m. ET/4 p.m. CT/2 p.m. PT; though still somewhat disadvantageous, the program now had a steady timeslot, along with little to no ratings pressure, as Disney Channel was then offered as a premium cable service which paid little attention to program ratings.

After the sixth season (1989) was filmed, the show was put on hiatus for a year, during which time most of the cast moved on to other projects or aged out of the program. The only two who were invited to return in 1991 when it resumed production were Kenny Ford and Jennifer Love Hewitt.

Budget cuts and the expiration of Disney&#x27;s output agreement with MGM prompted another hiatus in 1993, leading to the show&#x27;s end, after Season 9&#x27;s ten episodes completed production. The last episode aired on January 9, 1994. The show continued to be shown in reruns on the Disney Channel until May 30, 1996, and remains the network&#x27;s longest-running program.

Originally taped at Hollywood Center Studios, later seasons were produced at Sunset Gower Studios.

===Producers===
Throughout its history, other producers and production companies were associated with the show, including
K-tel Entertainment, Lynch-Biller Productions (later Lynch Entertainment; now The Tom Lynch Company), RHI Entertainment, and MGM Television (a.k.a. MGM-Pathé). Hal Roach Studios/Qintex, the studio responsible for the &quot;Our Gang&quot; (Little Rascals) short films series of the 1930s, was also involved with it. (Qintex was also responsible for the distribution of 1989 roller derby series &quot;RollerGames&quot;.)

The show essentially launched the careers of creators and producers Gary Biller and Thomas W. Lynch, who would go on to create &quot;The Secret World of Alex Mack&quot; and &quot;Romeo!&quot; (for Nickelodeon) among many other shows, leading the &quot;New York Times&quot; to call him &quot;the David E. Kelley of &#x27;tween TV&quot;. Prior to it, Lynch and Biller created and produced a long-running music video series for TBS, &quot;Night Tracks&quot;.

==Merchandise==

===&quot;Kids Incorporated: The Beginning&quot; and other videos===
The 1983 pilot was recorded in August 1983 but never shown on television; however, in 1985, it was released on Beta and VHS as &quot;Kids Incorporated: The Beginning&quot;. In order to include Rahsaan Patterson, who joined the show after the pilot was shot, a new storyline was edited into the film. His character, Kid, was depicted as the new kid in town, who was very shy and afraid to audition for the group. He also revealed the origins of them. The &quot;Kid&quot; scenes were filmed in 1985, and edited in, with the 1983 footage of the rest of the cast or in with it.

Two additional videos were released in 1985, entitled &quot;ChartBusters&quot; and &quot;The Best of Kids Incorporated&quot;. While the show was still in syndication, four albums were also released, titled
* &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; (1983)
* &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; (1984)
* &quot;Kids Incorporated: The Chart Hits&quot; (1985)
* &quot;Kids Incorporated: New Attitude&quot; (1985)
At least two of these achieved platinum sales status. No further ones were released when the show moved to the Disney Channel because the company that produced them, K-Tel Records, filed for bankruptcy at around the same time.

==International versions==

===Japan===
An original Japanese adaptation of the show, titled &quot;StarS&quot;, ran from 1999 to 2001. Between 13 and 26 episodes were filmed in each of its three seasons. A second version, &quot;StarS2&quot;, was scheduled to premiere on MBS in the summer of 2007. Both were produced by TOEI and co-produced by Sunrise Studios.

In addition, the American version, dubbed into Japanese, was shown on the MBS network until 2001.

===New Zealand===
The original New Zealand version of the show, &quot;High Life&quot;, began production in 1990. It ran periodically for five seasons, broadcasting six episodes per year, until 1995, when TVNZ-2 cancelled it.

===Canada===
&quot;The Rockets&quot; (aired on CKY Television in 1987, 1989 and 1991) is sort of a Canadian &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;.

<text>Marta Marrero (born May 18, 1969), better known by her stage name Martika ( ), is an American singer and actress. She rose to prominence as an actress, playing the role of Gloria in the television programme &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; between 1984 and 1986. Following her appearance in the show, Martika signed a recording contract with Columbia Records, and in October 1988, released her self titled debut album to critical acclaim. It spawned the internationally successful single &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot;, which peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two weeks. It received similar commercial success in other international territories, and received a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Other singles released from the album – &quot;More Than You Know&quot;, &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; and &quot;Water&quot; – also achieved commercial success. The album sold over three million copies worldwide.

Her second and final album, &quot;Martika&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; (1991), failed to match the commercial success achieved by &quot;Martika&quot;. It did, however, spawn a number of commercially successful singles, including &quot;Love... Thy Will Be Done&quot; and &quot;Martika&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, both of which charted within the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, whilst &quot;Coloured Kisses&quot; achieved some commercial success in the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. The album was certified Gold by both the Australian Recording Industry Association and British Phonographic Industry. &quot;Martika&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; is estimated to have sold over one million copies worldwide. In 1992, she quit the music industry, citing burnout and feeling overwhelmed with the burden of fame.

She returned to the music industry in 2000, forming the band Oppera with her husband Nikki. In 2005, her single &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot; was heavily sampled on &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot; by American rapper Eminem, with Martika credited as one of the songwriters. In 2012, she released her first solo single since 1993, &quot;Flow With the Go&quot;, via DCR Records. Originally intended to serve as the lead single from a third album entitled &quot;Mirror Ball&quot;, the album was eventually shelved due to personal reasons.

==Early life, family and education==
Martika was born in Whittier, California, to Cuban parents of Canary Islands ancestry.

==Career==
===&quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; (1982–1988)===
She entered mainstream show business in an uncredited role as one of the girls in the 1982 motion picture &quot;Annie&quot;. This led to her being cast as Gloria on the long-running children&#x27;s show &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; as one of a group of neighborhood children who rise to local fame by singing staged productions at a corner malt shop. Once the second season began, she formally adopted her stage name Martika Marrero before shortening it to the mononym Martika, which she has used ever since. Martika and many other &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; cast members were featured in the musical numbers from the Mr. T motivational video &quot;Be Somebody... or Be Somebody&#x27;s Fool!&quot; in 1984.

Following her role in &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; and &quot;Be Somebody&quot;, Martika was signed by Columbia Records. Her first solo release was released only in Japan: &quot;We are Music&quot; was recorded to promote Sony cassette tapes in the Japanese market, where the song was released in 12&quot;, 7&quot; and CD formats.

In 1987, Martika recorded a version of the Michael Jay/Gregory Smith song &quot;Bounce Back&quot;, which included a music video which was aired on &quot;Entertainment &#x27;80&quot;, although it was not available for purchase.

===Rise to prominence and &quot;Martika&quot; (1988–1991)===
Her debut album, &quot;Martika&quot; (1988), reached number fifteen on the US Billboard 200 albums chart. The album spawned the internationally successful single &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot;, which she co-wrote with her producer Michael Jay and it became a top-5 hit in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, and Australia. In the US, &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot; spent two weeks at No. 1 in 1989. &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot; also went to No. 1 in New Zealand. &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot; was written about drug addiction, but can sound like a break-up ballad. 

Two additional singles were released from &quot;Martika&quot;, and also charted within the top forty in the United States – &quot;More Than You Know&quot; and &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; which reached No. 18 and No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 respectively. &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; is a cover version of Carole King&#x27;s song from her album &quot;Tapestry&quot;. Both of the singles also peaked within the top twenty on the US Dance charts and the UK Singles Chart. &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; also reached the top 10 in Australia. New Zealand, and Ireland. A fourth and final single from the album, &quot;Water&quot;, entered the lower regions of the UK and Australian charts. &quot;Water&quot; is partially sung in Spanish, a homage to Martika&#x27;s Cuban ancestry. Other songs were re-recorded fully in Spanish for international release.

The album was certified platinum in the UK in 1990, and double platinum in Australia. In the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America awarded &quot;Martika&quot; a Gold certification, indicating sales in excess of 500,000 copies. In 1990, Martika co-wrote the track &quot;Kiss Me Quick&quot; with Michael Jay and Marvin Morrow. The track was recorded by freestyle/pop singer Alisha for her 1990 album &quot;Bounce Back&quot;, with Martika contributing backing vocals. &quot;Martika&quot; has since sold over three million copies internationally since its initial release.

===&quot;Martika&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; and hiatus (1991–2000)===

Martika was encouraged by her agent to combine her love of film and music by scoring soundtracks and, in 1990, she wrote and recorded the song &quot;Blue Eyes Are Sensitive to the Light&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Arachnophobia&quot;. The producers of the album did not like her vocals, so the song was re-recorded by Sara Hickman for the film. The song has also been recorded by Brazilian singers Deborah Blando (on her 1991 debut, &quot;A Different Story&quot;), Elba Ramalho, and Frances Ruffelle.

In 1991, Martika approached Prince to do some new tracks. Among these was her second (and last) US Top-10 single, &quot;Love... Thy Will Be Done&quot;, which also became a Top-10 hit in the UK and reached No. 1 in Australia. &quot;Love... Thy Will Be Done&quot; started out as a prayer written by Martika, and Prince then changed it into a song.

Her second album, &quot;Martika&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, peaked at No. 111 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Albums chart. The title track received only minor airplay in the US, and reached No. 93 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. However, the album was a bigger success abroad, though on a lesser scale than her debut. It peaked at No. 15 in the UK Albums Chart, No. 9 in Australia, and spawned further hits with the songs &quot;Coloured Kisses&quot; and the title track, &quot;Martika&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;. &quot;Temptation&quot;, another track from this album, was covered by Patti LaBelle on her album &quot;Burnin&#x27;&quot;. Martika played the role of the lounge singer Dahlia Mendez in the crime drama TV series &quot;Wiseguy&quot; in 1990, opposite Steven Bauer who took over from Ken Wahl for the fourth and final season.

She eventually faded from the public eye in 1992 after walking away from the music industry, due to burnout and feeling overwhelmed with the burden of fame. In 1997, a greatest hits compilation album &quot;The Best of Martika: More Than You Know&quot; was released.

===Return to music and Oppera (2000–2011)===

During the 2000 explosion of Latin pop, Martika sang backing vocals on various projects and contributed lyrics to releases by other artists, although she failed to receive any major-label attention for herself. Instead, she built martika.net in 2001, a website for her fans, and released a remix of a newly self-recorded song, &quot;The Journey&quot;. She also recorded a track &quot;Monday&quot; for a new solo album which the website stated was on its way. Eventually, however, her website was shut down and the album never materialized.

In 2003, Martika and her husband, musician Michael Mozart, formed the band Oppera. Adopting a Latin pop sound, she and Mozart released Oppera&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Violince&quot;, in 2004. Rapper Eminem used a sample of her biggest US hit, &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot;, for &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot;, a track on his 2004 album &quot;Encore&quot; and featured Martika on the chorus of the track. In response, Martika&#x27;s British greatest hits album was repackaged with its title altered to &quot;Toy Soldiers: The Best of Martika&quot;. A biography was added to the album insert reflecting the new Eminem sample, though it asserted that she had not released any albums since &quot;Martika&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;.

Oppera released a self-titled second album in 2005. Martika promoted &quot;Oppera&quot;″s release with a Borders bookstore tour. In 2010, Martika, using the stage name Vida Edit, starred as Lolly Pop and co-produced a web-based television action program &quot;J8ded&quot;.

===&quot;Mirror Ball&quot; and touring (2011–present)===

In October 2011, Martika stopped using the stage name Vida Edit and launched a new personal website. A year later, she announced an Australian tour, but it was canceled. She performed in 2014 alongside Debbie Gibson, Samantha Fox, and Rick Astley at a HitParade Festival in Chile. In 2012, she released &quot;Flow With the Go&quot; via DCR Records, which marked her first solo single release since &quot;Safe in the Arms of Love&quot; which was released as the last single from &quot;Martika&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, and other than a remixed, promotional only release of &quot;Spirit&quot;, also marked her last single to be released during her initial musical career. Despite her first single release in over twenty years, Martika did express doubts about a &quot;full musical comeback&quot;, citing &quot;changes to the music industry&quot; and claimed she is &quot;not really basically career-driven like I was back when I was a teenager&quot;, claiming that she &quot;just sort of become like a happy housewife&quot;. The release of &quot;Flow With the Go&quot; was supported by an Australian tour in 2012. 

The single was originally intended to serve as the lead single from her third studio album, &quot;Mirror Ball&quot;. Originally intended to be an album release consisting of purely new material, Martika spent a considerable amount of months in the recording studio engaging in the recording and songwriting process, however, as a result of the death of a &quot;close family member&quot;, &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; was subsequently shelved.

In July 2016, she was part of the Totally 80s Tour of Australia. The concerts included seven international 1980s acts, including Martika, Berlin, Limahl of Kajagoogoo, Paul Lekakis, Katrina of Katrina and the Waves, Men Without Hats and Stacey Q. For her performance at the tour, she received positive reviews from the Australian press. She claimed that touring was an entirely new concept for her, citing the fact she had been out of the music industry for the past twenty-five years and hadn&#x27;t performed any of her songs since then. Speaking about the Australian tour, she claimed that it was a &quot;fresh experience for me&quot; to &quot;wake the songs up&quot; after a considerably long period of time.

<doc id="101368" wikidata="Q822800" url="?curid=101368" title="New Jersey Route 45">
<text>Route 45 is a state highway in the southern part of New Jersey. It runs from Route 49 in Salem, Salem County, northeast to U.S. Route 130 (US 130) in Westville, Gloucester County. The route is signed as a north-south highway. Much of the southern part of the route runs through rural areas of Salem and Gloucester counties, passing through the communities of Woodstown and Mullica Hill. North of Mullica Hill, Route 45 runs through suburban areas, with the portion of the route between the northern border of Mantua Township and the southern border of Woodbury a four-lane divided highway. The route intersects many highways, including US 40 in Woodstown, Route 77 and US 322 in Mullica Hill, and Interstate 295 (I-295) in West Deptford Township.

The current route was originally a segment of pre-1927 Route 6 that was created in 1917, running from Salem to Camden. Route 45 was designated in 1927 to replace the Salem-Camden branch of pre-1927 Route 6 and was eventually realigned to follow US 130 (Crescent Boulevard) to the Airport Circle in Pennsauken Township. The old alignment became Route 45M. The northern terminus of Route 45 was moved to its current location in 1953 in order to avoid the concurrency with US 130. A freeway for Route 45 between I-295 in Woodbury and US 322 in Mullica Hill was recommended by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission in the 1960s. It was never built, and the New Jersey Department of Transportation proposed widening all of Route 45 into a four-lane divided highway; only a small portion in northern Gloucester County was widened.

==Route description==

===Salem County===

Route 45 begins at an intersection with Route 49 in Salem, Salem County, heading to the north on Market Street, a two-lane undivided road. It passes downtown businesses and both the Salem County Courthouse and the Old Salem County Courthouse, the second oldest active courthouse in the United States, which currently serves as the Salem City Court. Upon crossing County Route 657 (CR 657), the road heads into residential areas before crossing the SMS Rail Lines&#x27; Salem Branch line at-grade and the Fenwick Creek. At the crossing of the latter, Route 45 enters Mannington Township and becomes an unnamed road that passes marshland with some development. The route passes by the Salem Medical Center just prior to an intersection with CR 540 in Pointers.
Here, Route 45 turns to the east and forms a concurrency with CR 540, passing through farmland with some woods and homes. CR 540 splits from Route 45 by heading southeast on Welchville Road and Route 45 continues, intersecting CR 653 before crossing the Mannington Creek. It intersects CR 669 and CR 631 within a short distance of each other before passing northwest of Salem County Career and Technical High School and crossing Majors Run into Pilesgrove Township.

Here, the route intersects CR 679 near the Salem County Veterans Cemetery before heading through more agricultural areas. The route reaches an intersection with US 40 (Harding Highway) and CR 616 in a business area, where US 40 forms a concurrency with Route 45. The two routes head northeast into Woodstown as the Harding Highway into residential areas.

At the intersection with Main Street in downtown, Route 45 splits from US 40 by heading north on Main Street while CR 672 heads south on Main Street and US 40 continues to the east on East Avenue. Route 45 continues north, intersecting CR 636 before turning northeast again and meeting CR 602. The road passes over the SMS Rail Lines&#x27; Salem Branch line before coming to an intersection with CR 668/CR 617. A short distance later, the route enters Pilesgrove Township again and heads back into farmland with some residences and forested areas as an unnamed road, crossing CR 660.

===Gloucester County===

Route 45 crosses Oldmans Creek into South Harrison Township, Gloucester County within woodland and continues through rural areas with some residential developments such as Woodstown-Mullica Hill Road. The route crosses CR 668 before crossing CR 694 and CR 607 within a close distance of each other. Past this intersection, it continues to CR 617, where the name changes to Woodstown Road, before crossing CR 538. A short distance later, the route enters Harrison Township and continues north. It enters the community of Mullica Hill, where it intersects the northern terminus of Route 77. Here, Route 45 turns north and becomes Main Street, passing homes and some businesses and turning into a county-maintained road. The route intersects Mullica Road, at which point it becomes concurrent with unsigned US 322 Bus./CR 536.

In Mullica Hill, the road crosses US 322 and CR 536A, where US 322 Bus. ends and CR 536 turns west along US 322, and Route 45 continues northeast along Main Street, passing residential and commercial development as a state-maintained road. The route intersects CR 664, CR 603, and CR 667, with a park and ride lot located at the southwest corner of the CR 667 intersection. Following this, Route 45 has an intersection with CR 624 before crossing into Mantua Township, where it becomes Bridgeton Pike. The road heads through a mix of woods and farms with occasional homes, intersecting CR 626. The route passes more rural land before heading into suburban development.

Here, Route 45 intersects CR 627 and CR 678 as it passes a mix of homes and businesses. The route intersects CR 632, where the name changes to Mantua Pike, and CR 553 Alt. before widening into a four-lane divided highway and crossing the Mantua Creek. At this point, Route 45 turns to the north and forms the border between Deptford Township to the east and West Deptford Township to the west, intersecting CR 648 and CR 656. At the intersection with College Boulevard, the route forms the border between Woodbury Heights to the east and West Deptford Township to the west, crossing over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange. From here, Route 45 continues north, intersecting CR 652 and CR 650.
After the intersection with the latter, the route becomes a four-lane undivided road, entering Woodbury and immediately crossing the Southern Railroad of New Jersey&#x27;s Salem Branch line at-grade. The road crosses Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; (CSAO) Penns Grove Secondary railroad line at-grade before coming to an intersection with CR 551. Here, Route 45 forms a concurrency with CR 551 and heads north-northeast on Broad Street through the downtown of Woodbury, where it intersects CR 663. Route 45 and CR 551 cross the Woodbury Creek out of the downtown area and intersect CR 644 near Inspira Health Center Woodbury. From here, the route continues past a mix of residences and businesses as a two-lane undivided road. CR 551 splits from Route 45 by heading east on Park Avenue then north on Broadway.

Meanwhile, Route 45 continues north along the border between Deptford Township to the east and Woodbury to the west, with CSAO&#x27;s Vineland Secondary railroad line closely paralleling the route on its east side. At the intersection with CR 642, the road forms the border between Deptford Township and West Deptford Township again. The route widens into a four-lane divided highway as it comes to a partial interchange with I-295, with some of the movements provided by nearby CR 551 to the east. Past this interchange, Route 45 becomes a four-lane undivided highway and enters Westville. Here, it continues parallel to the railroad line to the east with businesses lining the west side of the road. Route 45 passes residential areas before it comes to its northern terminus at a partial interchange with US 130, with access to northbound US 130 and access from southbound US 130.

==History==

Between Mullica Hill and Woodbury, the road was maintained under the Mullica Hill and Woodbury Turnpike Company, which was chartered in 1849. The same day, the Woodbury and Camden Turnpike was chartered. Three days later, a bill was passed permitting the two companies to merge as the Mullica Hill and Camden Turnpike Company, though the merger seems to have fallen through, as charter amendments would be administered to the former two companies&#x27; charters. The Woodbury and Camden was rechartered as the Camden and Gloucester Turnpike Company in 1853. From Mullica Hill to Woodstown, the Mullica Hill and Woodstown Turnpike Company maintained a road, though it&#x27;s now bypassed by Route 45. South of Woodstown, the road was maintained by the Salem and Woodstown Turnpike.

What is now Route 45 was originally designated as a segment of pre-1927 Route 6 in 1917. This route was to head south from Camden and follow Route 45 to Mullica Hill, where it split into two branches, with one going to Salem on current Route 45 and another going to Bridgeton on current Route 77. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, pre-1927 Route 6 between Camden and Salem became Route 45. A bypass around Camden was created as the southern half of Crescent Boulevard, a part of US 130, and Route 45 was rerouted to use the bypass up to the Airport Circle in Pennsauken Township. The old alignment of Route 45 became Route 45M. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the northern terminus of Route 45 was cut back to its current location in Westville to avoid the concurrency with US 130.

In the late 1960s, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) proposed construction of a long, $20 million freeway along the Route 45 corridor in Gloucester County which would have extended from Exit 24 of I-295 in Woodbury to a planned US 322 freeway in Mullica Hill. The New Jersey Department of Transportation never followed through on this proposal. A portion of Route 45 was widened to four lanes from the border of Woodbury to the border of Mantua Township by the 1980s. In 2012, the Mullica Hill Bypass was completed, and US 322 was removed from its concurrency with Route 45.

==Major intersections==





==Future==
The New Jersey Department of Transportation is planning on rebuilding Route 45 in Woodbury to make it more friendly to pedestrians and bicyclists. The project calls for reducing the road from four lanes to three lanes while adding bike lanes, curb extensions to improve safety for pedestrians, and improvements to curb ramps and crosswalks. It is currently in the design stage.

<text>The Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (; postnominal abbr. OFMCap) is a religious order of Franciscan friars within the Catholic Church, one of three &quot;First Orders&quot; that reformed from the Franciscan Friars Minor Observant (OFMObs, now OFM), the other being the Conventuals (OFMConv). Franciscans reformed as Capuchins in 1525 with the purpose of regaining the original Habit (tunic) of St. Francis of Assisi and also for returning to a stricter observance of the rule established by Francis of Assisi in 1209.

==History==

===Origins ===

The Order arose in 1525 when Matteo da Bascio, an Observant Franciscan friar native to the Italian region of Marche, said he had been inspired by God with the idea that the manner of life led by the friars of his day was not the one which their founder, St. Francis of Assisi, had envisaged. He sought to return to the primitive way of life of solitude and penance, as practised by the founder of their Order.

His religious superiors tried to suppress these innovations and Friar Matteo and his first companions were forced into hiding from Church authorities, who sought to arrest them for having abandoned their religious duties. They were given refuge by the Camaldolese monks, in gratitude for which they later adopted the hood (or &quot;cappuccio&quot;, &quot;capuche&quot;) worn by that Order—which was the mark of a hermit in that region of Italy—and the practise of wearing a beard. The popular name of their Order originates from this feature of their religious habit.

In 1528, Friar Matteo obtained the approval of Pope Clement VII and was given permission to live as a hermit and to go about everywhere preaching to the poor. These permissions were not only for himself, but for all such as might join him in the attempt to restore the most literal observance possible of the Rule of St. Francis. Matteo and the original band were soon joined by others. Matteo and his companions were formed into a separate province, called the Hermit Friars Minor, as a branch of the Conventual Franciscans, but with a Vicar Provincial of their own, subject to the jurisdiction of the Minister General of the Conventuals. The Observants, the other branch of the Franciscan Order at that time, continued to oppose the movement.

===Rules of the Order===
In 1529, they had four houses and held their first General Chapter, at which their particular rules were drawn up. The eremitical idea was abandoned, but the life was to be one of extreme austerity, simplicity and poverty—in all things as near an approach to St Francis&#x27; ideals as was practicable. Neither the monasteries nor the Province should possess anything, nor were any loopholes left for evading this law. No large provision against temporal wants should be made, and the supplies in the house should never exceed what was necessary for a few days. Everything was to be obtained by begging, and the friars were not allowed even to touch money.

The communities were to be small, eight being fixed as the normal number and twelve as the limit. In furniture and clothing extreme simplicity was enjoined and the friars were discalced, required to go bare-footed—without even sandals. Like the Observants, the Capuchins wore a brown habit but of most simple form, i.e. only a tunic, with the distinctive large, pointed hood reaching to the waist attached to it, girdled by the traditional woolen cord with three knots. By visual analogy, the Capuchin monkey and the cappuccino style of coffee are both named after the shade of brown used for their habit.

Besides the canonical choral celebration of the Divine Office, a portion of which was recited at midnight, there were two hours of private prayer daily. The fasts and disciplines were rigorous and frequent. Their main external work was preaching and spiritual ministrations among the poor. In theology the Capuchins abandoned the later Franciscan School of Scotus and returned to the earlier school of St. Bonaventure.

===Early setbacks===
At the outset of its history, the Capuchins underwent a series of severe blows. Two of the founders left it: Matteo Serafini of Bascio (Matteo Bassi) returning to the Observants, while his first companion, on being replaced in the office of Vicar Provincial, became so insubordinate that he had to be expelled from the Order. Even more scandalously, the third Vicar General, Bernardino Ochino, left the Catholic faith in 1543 after fleeing to Switzerland, where he was welcomed by John Calvin, became a Calvinist pastor in Zürich, and married. Years later, claims that he had written in favor of polygamy and Unitarianism caused him to be exiled from that city and he fled again, first to Poland and then to Moravia, where he died.

As a result, the whole province came under the suspicion of heretical tendencies and the Pope resolved to suppress it. He was dissuaded with difficulty, but the Capuchins were forbidden to preach.

===Expansion===
Despite earlier setbacks, the authorities were eventually satisfied as to the soundness of the general body of Capuchin friars and the permission to preach was restored. The movement then began to multiply rapidly, and by the end of the 16th century the Capuchins had spread all over the Catholic parts of Europe, so that in 1619 they were freed from their dependence on the Conventual Franciscans and became an independent Order. They are said to have had at that time 1500 houses divided into fifty provinces. They were one of the chief tools in the Catholic Counter-reformation, the aim of the order being to work among the poor, impressing the minds of the common people by the poverty and austerity of their life, and sometimes with sensationalist preaching such as their use of the supposedly possessed Marthe Brossier to arouse Paris against the Huguenots.

The activities of the Capuchins were not confined to Europe. From an early date they undertook missions to non-Catholics in America, Asia and Africa, and a college was founded in Rome for the purpose of preparing their members for foreign missions. Due to this strong missionary thrust, a large number of Capuchins have suffered martyrdom over the centuries. Activity in Europe and elsewhere continued until the close of the 18th century, when the number of Capuchin friars was estimated at 31,000.

===Cimitero dei Cappuccini: The Capuchin Crypt===
The crypt is located just under the Church of Santa Maria della Concezione in Rome, a church commissioned by Pope Urban VIII in 1626. The pope&#x27;s brother, Cardinal Antonio Barberini, who was of the Capuchin Order, in 1631 ordered the remains of thousands of Capuchin friars exhumed and transferred from the friary on the Via dei Lucchesi to the crypt. The bones were arranged along the walls in varied designs, and the friars began to bury their own dead here, as well as the bodies of poor Romans whose tomb was under the floor of the present Mass chapel. Here the Capuchins would come to pray and reflect each evening before retiring for the night.

The crypt, or ossuary, now contains the remains of 4,000 friars buried between 1500 and 1870, during which time the Roman Catholic Church permitted burial in and under churches. The underground crypt is divided into five chapels, lit only by dim natural light seeping in through cracks, and small fluorescent lamps. The crypt walls are decorated extensively with the remains, depicting various religious themes. Some of the skeletons are intact and draped with Franciscan habits, but for the most part, individual bones are used to create the elaborate ornamental designs.

A plaque in the chapel reads:

&quot;What you are now, we used to be.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;What we are now, you will be.&quot;

Mark Twain visited the crypt in the summer of 1867, and begins Volume 2, Chapter 1, of &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot; with five pages of his observations.

==Modern era==

Like all other Orders, the Capuchins suffered severely from the secularizations and revolutions of the end of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th; but they survived the strain, and during the latter part of the 19th century rapidly recovered ground. At the beginning of the 20th century there were fifty provinces with some 500 friaries and 300 hospices or lesser houses; and the number of Capuchin friars, including lay brothers, was reckoned at 9,500. The Capuchins still keep up their missionary work and have some 200 missionary stations in all parts of the world—notably India, Ethiopia, and parts of the former Ottoman Empire. Though &quot;the poorest of all Orders&quot;, it has attracted into its ranks an extraordinary number of the highest nobility and even of royalty. The celebrated Theobald Mathew, the apostle of Temperance in Ireland, was a Capuchin friar.

In the Imperial Crypt, underneath the Church of the Capuchins in Vienna, over 140 members of the Habsburg dynasty are buried. The most recent burial in the crypt was in 2011 for Otto von Habsburg, the last crown prince of Austria-Hungary and eldest son of the last Austrian Emperor, the Blessed Charles of Austria.

, there were 10,480 Capuchins worldwide, of whom 7,070 were priests, living and working in 108 countries around the world: Africa: 1,357; South America: 1,657; North America: 664; Asia-Oceania: 2,339; Western Europe: 3,500; Central-Eastern Europe: 769. In Great Britain there are currently five Capuchin friaries, and eight in Ireland.

The worldwide head of the Order, called the Minister General, is currently Friar Roberto Genuin.

===India===

The community of Bettiah Christians was founded after a Capuchin friar Joseph Mary cured the queen of Bettiah of a malady and was invited by Maharaja Dhurup Singh of the Bettiah Raj to stay. This appointment that was approved by Pope Benedict XIV on 1 May 1742.

===United States===
The United States has six provinces throughout the country. Together with the two provinces in Canada, the province of Australia and the Custody of the Mariana Islands/Hawaii they form the North American-Pacific Capuchin Conference (NAPCC).

====Foundation====
The Province of St. Joseph, originally the province of Calvary, headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, was one of the first two Capuchin Provinces to be established in the country in 1882. It was founded by Francis Haas (1826–1895) and Bonaventure Frey (1831–1912), two Swiss diocesan priests who arrived in the United States in September 1856, and were received into the then-Diocese of Milwaukee by Bishop John Henni, also a Swiss immigrant, and given charge of St. Nicholas Parish which they renamed Mount Calvary. They were later admitted to the Capuchin Order on December 2, 1857, by Antoine Gauchet of the Swiss Province who had been sent to admit them in order to establish the Order in the United States. The friars started St. Lawrence Seminary High School in 1861 at Mount Calvary, Wisconsin, a school that is still owned and operated by the Capuchin Order.

One of the friars of this province, Solanus Casey, was noted for the holiness of his life, serving as the porter of several Capuchin friaries both in Michigan and New York City for decades. As a miraculous healing attributed to him was approved by Pope Francis in mid-2017, he was beatified in Detroit at Ford Field on November 18, 2017. This is significant because Casey could become the first male American-born Saint in the history of the Catholic Church. He had previously been declared Venerable in 1995 by Pope John Paul II. His tomb is in St. Bonaventure Monastery in Detroit, and is visited by thousands every year.

, the province has 23 communities spread throughout the American Midwest, reaching from Michigan to Arizona. Additionally, there are friars of this province working in Central America, with a community serving in the Middle East.

====Other jurisdictions====
* St. Joseph or Calvary (1882), based in Detroit, Michigan, covering the upper Midwest, from Detroit to Montana and from which came Blessed Solanus Casey.
* St. Augustine (1882), based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to which Cardinal Sean O&#x27;Malley belongs.
* Stigmata (ca. 1913), based in Union City, New Jersey, founded by friars from the Tuscan region of Italy with 8 communities on the East Coast, with friaries in Beacon, New York, Hackensack, New Jersey, Hoboken, New Jersey, Wilmington, Delaware (2), Atlanta, Georgia, and Miami, Florida. 
* St. Mary of New York and New England (1952), based in White Plains, New York, with 18 fraternities on the East Coast, covering New England and New York. They supervise the Custody of Japan and the Custody of Guam.
* St. Conrad or Mid-America (1977), based in Denver, Colorado, serving Illinois, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri and Texas, with missionaries in Papua New Guinea; a friar of this province, Charles J. Chaput, was installed as the Archbishop of Philadelphia on 8 September 2011.
* Our Lady of Angels (1979), Western America, based in Burlingame, California. Seven communities in California, with four communities in Mexico which became the Custody of St. Juan Diego in December 2011.
* Our Lady, Star of the Sea Vice-Province/Custody (1982), Guam and Hawaii, this division is dependent on St. Mary Province.

== Capuchin Poor Clares ==
The Capuchin Poor Clares are cloistered nuns of the Order of St. Clare, who form the female branch of the Capuchin Order. They were founded in 1538 in Naples by the Venerable Maria Laurentia Longo, who was Abbess of the Poor Clare monastery of that city. She and the other nuns of that community embraced the then-new Capuchin reform movement, and so austere was the life that they were called &quot;Sisters of Suffering&quot;. The Order soon spread to France, Spain and beyond. They live according to the same rules and regulations as the Capuchin friars, and are held as members of the friars&#x27; provinces.

In the United States, as of 2012, there are five monasteries of this Order. There are about 50 nuns in these communities, which are located in: Denver and Pueblo in Colorado, Alamo and Amarillo (the first, founded 1981) in Texas, and Wilmington, Delaware. The monasteries were almost all founded from Mexico, where there are some 1,350 Capuchin nuns in 73 monasteries. The monastery in Pueblo is a foundation of the monastery in Amarillo. Together they form the Federation of Our Lady of the Angels.

==Appearance==
The Capuchins are unique for a Catholic religious order in that the growing of natural, untrimmed beards features as part of its first Constitution, which states as the reason, the beard is &quot;manly, austere, natural, an imitation of Christ and the saints of our Order, and despised.&quot; This makes the Capuchin friars stand out in particular from the secular clergy of the Latin Church, who have no rule on such matters. In more recent times, since the Second Vatican Council, the beard has no longer been mandatory but is still common. Like other Franciscans, the friars wear a plain brown tunic with a hood, a cord fastened around the waist, and sandals (or shoes).

* Helyot&#x27;s &quot;Hist. des ordres religieux&quot; (1792), vii. c. 24 and c. 27, gives an account of the Capuchins up to the end of the 17th century.

<doc id="101370" wikidata="Q822839" url="?curid=101370" title="New Jersey Route 47">
<text>Route 47 is a state highway in the southern part of New Jersey. It runs from Atlantic Avenue in Wildwood, Cape May County, north to US 130 in Brooklawn, Camden County. It is also referred to as Delsea Drive, as it connects the Delaware River near Brooklawn to the Atlantic Ocean (the sea) in Wildwood. This name was assigned by the New Jersey Legislature in 1933. The route runs through rural areas of Cape May and southern Cumberland counties as a two-lane road. Traffic jams along this portion of Route 47 are commonplace in the summer vacation season and can stretch for miles due to the missing southern section of Route 55, where all Jersey Shore-bound traffic enters the small two-lane road. North of here, the route runs through the cities of Millville and Vineland before entering Gloucester County, where it passes through more rural areas as well as Clayton and Glassboro. Past Glassboro, it heads through suburban areas in Washington and Deptford townships before running through Westville and Brooklawn. Route 47 is the longest signed state route in New Jersey.

What is now Route 47 was originally designated as part of pre-1927 Route 15 between Rio Grande in 1917 and as a branch of pre-1927 Route 20 between Millville and Westville in 1923. In 1927, Route 47 was designated to run from Tuckahoe to Brooklawn, following current Route 49 south of Millville. Meanwhile, current Route 47 was a part of Route 49 between South Dennis and Millville and Route S49 between Rio Grande and South Dennis. The latter was extended to Wildwood in 1938. Route 47 and Route 49 were shifted onto their current alignments south of Millville in 1953. Since then, Route 47 has seen a few improvements and modifications including realignment in Millville and the reconstruction of the intersection with Route 83 in Dennis Township.

== Route description ==
=== Cape May County ===

Route 47 begins at a traffic light with Atlantic Avenue in the Jersey Shore city of Wildwood in Cape May County, heading to the northwest on Rio Grande Avenue, a four-lane divided highway that is municipally-maintained. From this intersection, Rio Grande Avenue continues southeast a block to an intersection of Ocean Avenue near the Wildwood Boardwalk.

== History ==

The portion of Route 47 south of Port Elizabeth was a part of the Cohanseu trail, a Lenape trail running from Swedesboro to Cape May. North of Port Elizabeth, the road was maintained by several turnpikes: the Westville and Glassboro Turnpike, chartered in 1852, following Tanyard Road and Woodbury Road south of New Sharon; the Glassboro and Malaga Turnpike, chartered in 1851; the Millville and Malaga Turnpike, chartered in 1852; and the Port Elizabeth and Millville Turnpike, chartered in 1852. The modern road north of Port Elizabeth and from Dennisville to Goshen was incorporated into the Cape May Way, an auto trail running from Camden to Cape May.
The road was originally designated as a segment of pre-1927 Route 15 between Rio Grande and Millville in 1917, and as one of two branches of pre-1927 Route 20 between Millville and Westville in 1923. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 47 was legislated to run from Route 50 in Tuckahoe to Brooklawn, following present-day Route 49 between Tuckahoe and Millville and its current alignment north of Millville. Meanwhile, the present-day alignment of Route 47 between the current intersection of Route 83 in South Dennis and Millville was designated a part of Route 49 while the current alignment between South Dennis and US 9/Route 4 in Rio Grande became Route S49, a spur of Route 49. In 1933, the New Jersey Legislature named Route 47 Delsea Drive after a reporter for the &quot;Woodbury Times&quot; joked how the road connected the DELaware River to the Atlantic SEA. Route S49 was extended from Rio Grande to Park Boulevard in Wildwood in 1938. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 47 and Route 49 switched alignments south and east of Millville and Route 47 replaced Route S49 south to Wildwood.
By the 1980s, Route 47 was moved from High Street to North 2nd Street through the northern part of Millville. An alternate route of Route 47 was eventually created to the east along county routes in Cape May and Cumberland counties; this eventually became Route 347 by the 1990s.

In the 2000s, Rio Grande Avenue in Wildwood received improvements to make it reminisce the doo wop atmosphere the beach resort is known for.

The Route 47 bridge over Dennis Creek in Dennis Township and the intersection of Route 83 received improvements that were completed in July 2007. The Route 47 bridge over the creek was structurally deficient and in need of replacing. The job was completed with wider shoulders and a wider sidewalk on the new bridge. The intersection between Route 47 and Route 83 was also realigned and had signals installed.

In 2018, a $10 million construction project began to improve the section of Route 47 along Rio Grande Avenue at the entrance to Wildwood, which added a center left-turn lane, raised the road by , and added new lighting and signs. The project was completed in 2020. A dedication ceremony marking the completion of the project was held on July 1, 2020, with local officials in attendance. As part of the project, Rio Grande Avenue leading into Wildwood was to be renamed to Beach Ball Boulevard following a contest to rename the roadway. However, on July 10, 2020, it was announced that the Wildwood city commissioners decided to keep the road name as Rio Grande Avenue after receiving input from residents that the road name should not change.

<text>Uno is a small unincorporated community in Hart County, Kentucky, United States.

==Geography==
Uno is located east and slightly north of Horse Cave on U.S. Route 31E.

==History==
Uno was settled at some point in the mid-19th century. The community&#x27;s post office was established as Uno at sometime in the 1880s; its original name Clear Point belonged to another town before mail routes were established in the community.

It originally was known locally as a trading point of moonshine. According to tradition, discreet buyers of moonshine would say they were going to &quot;You know&quot; in order to get their supply.

<text>Route 48 is an east–west state highway in Salem County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a route running from U.S. Route 130 (US 130) and County Route 675 (CR 675) in Penns Grove southeast to US 40 in Carneys Point Township. It is known as East Main Street from US 130 to DuPont Road, and as the Harding Highway from DuPont Road to its terminus at US 40. Route 48 is signed east–west, although it travels more northwest–southeast throughout its route. It is a two-lane, undivided road through its entire length that intersects with Interstate 295 (I-295) and CR 551.

The road was originally created as Route 18S, running from Penns Grove to Atlantic City, in 1923, before becoming Route 48 in 1927. In Penns Grove, the route ended at a ferry which crossed the Delaware River to Wilmington, Delaware, connecting with Delaware Route 48 (DE 48) until the ferry service was terminated in 1951, when the Delaware Memorial Bridge opened. US 40 was also designated to run along the entire length of the route between Penns Grove and Atlantic City. On two occasions, US 40 has been relocated off portions of Route 48: once following a realignment to a ferry between New Castle, Delaware and Pennsville and again after the Delaware Memorial Bridge and New Jersey Turnpike opened in 1951. Route 48 was designated onto its current alignment in 1953, eliminating the concurrency it shared with US 40 from Carneys Point Township to Atlantic City.

== Route description ==

Route 48 begins at a traffic light with US 130 and CR 675 in Penns Grove, heading to the southeast on Main Street, a two-lane, undivided road. CR 675 continues west on Main Street past US 130. The road passes through residential areas, intersecting with local roads before entering Carneys Point Township. In Carneys Point Township, Route 48 crosses Dupont Road, becoming Harding Highway, and passes by Penns Grove High School, located on the south side of the road. The road enters a more rural setting and intersects CR 601 at a signalized intersection. Shortly after CR 601, the road comes to an interchange with I-295. Route 48 continues southeast through a mix of woodland and farmland, intersecting CR 551 at a traffic light. Just past the CR 551 junction, the road intersects CR 628, passing by Laytons Lake before crossing over the New Jersey Turnpike. Route 48 continues southeast for about another mile, crossing Stumpy Road before ending at an intersection with US 40.

== History ==

The entirety of the highway was once included in the Woodstown and Penn&#x27;s Grove Turnpike, chartered in 1852. The turnpike followed what is now US 40 to Woodstown.

The route was designated as Route 18S in 1923, running from Penns Grove southeast to Atlantic City along what was known as the Harding Highway. US 40 was designated along the length of Route 18S, running east from a ferry dock in Penns Grove where the route crossed the Delaware River to Wilmington, Delaware, to continue its journey west. The entire routing of Route 18S was designated Route 48 in the 1927 renumbering of New Jersey state highways, running concurrent with US 40 its entire length. Until the Delaware Memorial Bridge opened in 1951, a ferry connected Route 48 to DE 48 in Wilmington. US 40 had used this ferry, but was eventually moved to a ferry that ran from New Castle, Delaware, to Pennsville, with US 40 being rerouted to follow present-day Route 49, various local roads, and CR 551 to reach Route 48 and continue east along with that route. Following the completion of both the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951, US 40 was routed off more of Route 48 onto a new alignment, joining the route at its current eastern terminus. In the 1953 renumbering of New Jersey state highways, Route 48 was designated onto its current alignment from US 130 to US 40, with the rest of the route dropped in favor of the US 40 designation. The old alignment of Route 48 to the ferry terminal is now CR 675.

<text>Route 49 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs from an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike, Interstate 295 (I-295), and U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in Deepwater, Salem County, southeast to Route 50/County Route 557 (CR 557) in Tuckahoe, Cape May County. The route serves Salem, Cumberland, Atlantic, and Cape May counties, passing through rural areas and the communities of Salem, Bridgeton, and Millville along the way. It is a two-lane, undivided road for most of its length.

Route 49 was established in 1927 to run from Salem to Clermont, running along its present alignment between Salem and Millville, following current Route 47 between Millville and South Dennis, and running along present-day Route 83 between South Dennis and Clermont. It replaced a branch of pre-1927 Route 6 between Salem and Bridgeton and a part of pre-1927 Route 15 between Bridgeton and South Dennis. In 1953, Route 49 was routed onto its current alignment, replacing a part of Route 44 between Salem and Deepwater and following the former alignment of Route 47 between Millville and Tuckahoe. In the 1960s, a freeway was planned for Route 49 between Deepwater and Millville; it was never built. In the 2000s, many improvements have been or are being made to bridges along Route 49.

==Route description==

===Salem County===

Route 49 heads southwest on Broadway from an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike, I-295, and US 40 in the community of Deepwater in Pennsville Township, Salem County, near the Delaware Memorial Bridge. North of here, the road continues to the north as US 130. Route 49 passes through residential and commercial areas of Pennsville, turning to the south-southeast and passing west of Pennsville Memorial High School. The route intersects CR 630 (Fort Mott Road) before it continues into farmland. Route 49 then intersects the southern terminus of CR 551 (Hook Road and CR 632 (Lighthouse Road). It crosses the Salem River into Salem and becomes Front Street.

In Salem, the route intersects CR 657 (Griffith Street) at a crossing of the SMS Rail Lines&#x27; Salem Branch line and makes a right turn. It turns left onto Broadway and forms the main business district of the town. In downtown Salem, Route 49 intersects CR 625 (Chestnut Street), the southern terminus of Route 45 (Market Street), and CR 665 (Walnut Street). It crosses CR 658 (Keasbey Street/York Street) and enters Quinton Township, becoming Main Street and heading into agricultural areas. Route 49 heads east, meeting CR 650 (Hancocks Bridge Road) and CR 653 (Action Station Road). It crosses the Alloway Creek into the community of Quinton, where it intersects the southern terminus of CR 581 (Quinton Alloway Road) and CR 654 (Sickler Street). The route leaves Quinton and intersects CR 626 (Jericho Road), continuing southeast into wooded areas, where Route 49 crosses CR 667 (Pecks Corner Road) and CR 647 (Telegraph Road/Jericho Road).

===Cumberland County===
Route 49 crosses a stream, Sarah Run, into Stow Creek Township, Cumberland County, and heads into farmland as Shiloh Pike. Here, it crosses CR 624 (Jericho Road) and CR 617 (Columbia Highway). The route then intersects CR 635 (Old Cohansey Road) and continues south along the border of Stow Creek Township to the west and Hopewell Township to the east, entering Shiloh at the intersection with Mill Road. In Shiloh, Route 49 meets CR 620 (Roadstown Road) and CR 753 (East Avenue/West Avenue) in the center of town and heads southeast, crossing CR 695 (Maple Avenue/Randolph Road). The route enters Hopewell Township and intersects CR 661 (Barretts Run Road).
Past this intersection, Route 49 enters a more suburban landscape, crossing CR 621 (W. Park Drive). The route enters Bridgeton and becomes West Broad Street. In Bridgeton, it intersects CR 607 (West Avenue), CR 650 (Fayette Street), and CR 697 (Atlantic Street). Route 49 crosses the Cohansey River and comes to an intersection with Pearl Street, which heads to the north as Route 77 and to the south as CR 609. Past Pearl Street, Route 49 intersects CR 670 (East Commerce Street/Buckshutem Road) and crosses a Winchester and Western Railroad line as it continues to the east on East Commerce Street. It crosses CR 638 (N. Burlington Road) and enters Fairfield Township.

Route 49 continues east through a mix of woods and farms, intersecting CR 553 (Gouldtown-Woodruff Road) and CR 675 (Fordville-Gouldtown Road). It enters Millville and becomes Main Street, intersecting CR 682 (Sugarman Avenue) and CR 634 (Nabb Avenue). It intersects three more county routes, CR 714 (Morias Avenue), CR 625 (Hogbin Road), and CR 712 (Reick Road), before heading into the city. It intersects CR 608 (Carmel Road) and CR 698 (Beech Street), CR 667 (Sharp Street), and CR 610 (Brandriff Avenue) before meeting CR 555 (Cedar Street), which it forms a concurrency with. The route crosses the Maurice River and enters downtown Millville, where it intersects Route 47 (Second Street). Past Route 47, CR 555 splits from Route 49 by turning north onto Third Street. Route 49 heads east through the eastern part of Millville, crossing a Winchester and Western Railroad line and intersecting CR 678 (Wade Boulevard) before reaching an interchange with Route 55. Past Route 55, Route 49 heads southeast into woodland and crosses into Maurice River Township. In Maurice River Township, Route 49 intersects CR 671 (Union Road), CR 646 (Port Elizabeth-Cumberland Road), and CR 644 (Hesstown Road). Route 49 eventually forms the border of Maurice River Township to the north and Upper Township, Cape May County to the south.

===Atlantic and Cape May counties===
Route 49 crosses the Tuckahoe River into Estell Manor, Atlantic County. It runs a short distance to the north of the Tuckahoe River and intersects CR 649 (Aetna Avenue) and CR 666 (Cape May Avenue) at Head of the River Church. The route crosses the Tuckahoe River into Upper Township, Cape May County, and intersects the eastern terminus of CR 548 (Tuckahoe Road), heading to the east. It intersects CR 632 (Marshallville Road) and then comes to CR 617 (Woodbine Road), which heads south to provide access to CR 557. Route 49 continues east into Tuckahoe, where it comes to a bridge over the Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line operated by the Cape May Seashore Lines railroad and intersects CR 659 (Railroad Avenue) before it ends at Route 50/CR 557.

==History==

The road from Millville to the east end of Bridgeton was maintained by the Bridgeton and Millville Turnpike, chartered in 1854. From the west end of Bridgeton to the Salem-Cumberland line, then called Marlborough, was built by the Shiloh Turnpike Company, chartered in 1866. From there to Quinton&#x27;s Bridge, the road was maintained by the Marlborough and Quinton&#x27;s Bridge Turnpike Company, chartered in 1864. The company was in business by at least 1920.

Route 49 was legislated in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering to run from Route 45 in Salem to Route 4 (now US 9) in Clermont. The route replaced a branch of pre-1927 Route 6 between Salem and Bridgeton and a part of pre-1927 Route 15 between Bridgeton and South Dennis. A spur route of Route 49, Route S49, was created in 1927 to run from Route 49 in South Dennis to Route 4 in Rio Grande along the remainder of pre-1927 Route 15. Route S49 was extended to Wildwood in 1938.
In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 49 was extended west along what was a part of Route 44 to Deepwater to end at US 40 and US 130 near the Delaware Memorial Bridge. The eastern part of the route was realigned to head from Millville east to Route 50 in Tuckahoe, replacing what had been the southern part of Route 47. Meanwhile, Route 47 was realigned to head south from Millville, replacing Route 49 from Millville to South Dennis and the length of Route S49. The portion of Route 49 from South Dennis to Clermont became Route 83.

A freeway was proposed for Route 49 in the early 1960s, running from I-295 and US 40 at the Delaware Memorial Bridge to Route 55 in Millville. However, this freeway was canceled by 1967 as it closely paralleled the planned Route 60 freeway, which itself was never built.

In the 2000s, construction has occurred to replace many bridges along Route 49. The drawbridge over the Salem River was replaced by a fixed span in the mid-2000s. On October 1, 2008, the bridge over the railroad line in Tuckahoe was closed for reconstruction and reopened in June 2009. The bridge over the Cohansey River in Bridgeton was also reconstructed. Construction on this bridge started in October 2008 and was completed in July 2009.

<text>Party Girl is a 1995 American comedy-drama film starring Parker Posey, directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer, and the first feature film to premiere on the Internet.

==Synopsis==
Mary is a free-spirited young woman living in New York City who fills her days by going to nightclubs and house parties. When she is arrested for organizing an underground rave, she gets her godmother Judy to pay her bail. To repay the bail, Mary reluctantly agrees to work as a clerk at a branch of the New York Public Library that Judy manages. Despite her initial misgivings, Mary is inspired to learn how to use the Dewey Decimal System after smoking a joint and strikes up a romance with Mustafa, a Lebanese street vendor and aspiring teacher. Gradually, she becomes highly adept at her job but is later fired after having sex with Mustafa in the library. With no money to pay the accumulating rent, she and her roommate, club DJ Leo, face eviction from their apartment. In desperation, Mary sells her vintage couture to pay the bills.

During one of her parties, Mary takes drugs to forget a fight with Mustafa. The next day, she decides to seriously commit to being a librarian and investigates getting a graduate degree in library science. She invites Judy over for a serious talk but then Mary is dismayed to discover a raucous surprise birthday party complete with a male stripper. Mary implores with a skeptical Judy that she has finally found her calling in life, then Leo and Mustafa each share how Mary used her library science skills to help them improve their careers. Impressed, Judy gives Mary her job back, then joins the party.

==Cast==
* Parker Posey as Mary
* Anthony DeSando as Derrick
* Guillermo Díaz as Leo
* Donna Mitchell as Rene
* Liev Schreiber as Nigel
* Omar Townsend as Mustafa
* Sasha von Scherler as Judy Lindendorf
* Becky Mode as Ann
* Simon Verhoeven as Kurt

==Production==
The film had a budget of $150,000 and was shot in 19 days. Much of the cast and crew were already immersed in the queer downtown club scene long before the film was made. In an interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Posey recalls that in the early 1990s she &quot;would go out rollerblading at The Roxy on Sundays and to [the party] Love Machine, where I first saw RuPaul&quot;, and that, much like in &quot;Party Girl&quot; club scenes, Posey &quot;would dance with the queens, and they would just annihilate me on the dance floor with their moves.&quot;

According to director Daisy von Scherler Meyer, &quot;the fashion was really invented for the film. [Michael Clancy] created an aesthetic for the character and for the movie and combined that with Parker Posey&#x27;s own fashion obsession.&quot; Posey says that they relied on favors to assemble the outfits: &quot;The wardrobe designer, Michael Clancy, and his assistant Vicky Farrell ... pulled a lot of things from their friends&quot;, such as designer Todd Oldham.

==Internet broadcast==
&quot;Party Girl&quot; had an Internet premiere ahead of its wide release, transmitted from the office of Glenn Fleishman and his Point of Presence Company on June 3, 1995. While the early video transmission was limited to black and white, it marked the first time a feature film with an American movie theater release was broadcast generally online. Appearing live in the PoPCo offices, Posey welcomed Internet viewers and then introduced the film.

Fleishman recalled the event:
:I helped launch the first official full-length [Internet] movie premiere in 1995 in my offices in Seattle. The film was broadcast to several hundred people worldwide over a CU-SeeMe reflector at Point of Presence Company&#x27;s offices in downtown and then [in] a few minutes, it was projected at The Egyptian in Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill neighborhood. Parker Posey was in our offices to hit the start button on the broadcast. I was one cog in a larger set of wheels that involved the Seattle International Film Festival, Film.com (now part of RealNetworks), First Look Releasing, and the film&#x27;s producers, as well as another online development company and a CUSeeMe engineering consultant, Joseph Kahan who also worked at NASA down in Texas. The launch was shown on &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; in a five-minute segment at the bottom of the Sunday broadcast that week.

==Music==
With much of the action driven by clubs, party scenes, and a DJ character, most of the film&#x27;s music is diegetic, with characters often engaging with music appropriate to the mid-1990s club scene.

===Soundtrack album===
Selected tracks were compiled for the &quot;Party Girl&quot; soundtrack released June 8, 1995 by Relativity Records.
# &quot;Mama Told Me (Not to Come)&quot; – The Wolfgang Press
# &quot;Beautiful&quot; – Tom Tom Club
# &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me (No, No, No)&quot; – Dawn Penn
# &quot;Les Ailes&quot; – Khaled

# &quot;Never Take Your Place&quot; – Mr. Fingers
# &quot;Music Selector Is the Soul Reflector&quot; – Deee-Lite
# &quot;Party Girl (Turn Me Loose)&quot; – Ultra Naté

==Reception==
The film opened June 9, 1995, and grossed $472,370 during its initial theatrical release, and has since become a cult classic. Posey says she often gets approached by librarians who are fans of the film: &quot;Librarians and people who work in bookstores are like &#x27;Oh my God, thank you so much. &quot;Party Girl&quot; made me want to become a librarian. Von Scherler Meyer believes &quot;Party Girl&quot; resonates with audiences because of the film&#x27;s authentic depiction of underrepresented communities: &quot;When people say &#x27;Oh, the world [in &quot;Party Girl&quot;] is so diverse,&#x27; it&#x27;s like &#x27;No. That&#x27;s the world. You don&#x27;t represent the world in your stuff. Why is your world so segregated?&#x27; I think the world is messed up, and &quot;Party Girl&quot; is normal.&quot; On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10.

The film often is noted for its influence on fashion, particularly in the case of Mary&#x27;s wardrobe.

==Television spin-off==

A television series based on the film was produced in 1996, starring Christine Taylor as Mary and Swoosie Kurtz as Judy. Although six episodes were filmed, only four were aired and the show was quickly cancelled.

==Home video==
The 2023 Blu-ray release includes audio commentary by radio personality Jake Fogelnest.

<doc id="101385" wikidata="Q666687" url="?curid=101385" title="Juan de Valdés">
<text>Juan de Valdés (c.1490 – August 1541) was a Spanish religious writer and Catholic reformer.

He was the younger of twin sons of Fernando de Valdés, hereditary &quot;regidor&quot; of Cuenca in Castile, where Valdés was born. He has been confused with his twin brother Alfonso (a courtier of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who attended Charles&#x27;s coronation in Aachen in 1520 and was Latin secretary of state from 1524). Alfonso died in 1532 in Vienna.

== Biography ==
Juan, who probably studied at the University of Alcalá, first appears as the anonymous author of a politico-religious &quot;Diálogo de Mercurio y Carón&quot;, written and published about 1528. A passage in this work may have suggested Don Quixote&#x27;s advice to Sancho Panza on appointment to his governorship. The &quot;Diálogo&quot; attacked the corruptions of the Roman Church; hence Valdés, in fear of the Spanish Inquisition, left Spain for Naples in 1530.

In 1531 he moved to Rome, where his criticisms of papal policy were condoned, since in his &quot;Diálogo&quot; he had upheld the validity of Henry VIII&#x27;s marriage with Catherine of Aragon. On 12 January 1533 he writes from Bologna, in attendance upon Pope Clement VII. From the autumn of 1533 he made Naples his permanent residence, his name being Italianized as Valdésso and Val d&#x27;Esso. Confusion with his brother may account for the statement (without evidence) of his appointment by Charles V as secretary to the viceroy at Naples, Don Pedro de Toledo; there is no proof of his holding any official position, though Curione (in 1544) writes of him as &quot;cavalliere di Cesare.&quot; His house on the Chiaja was the centre of a literary and religious circle; his conversations and writings (circulated in manuscript) stimulated the desire for a spiritual reformation of the church.

His first production at Naples was a philological treatise, &quot;Diálogo de la Lengua&quot; (1535). His works entitle him to a foremost place among Spanish prose writers. His friends urged him to seek distinction as a humanist, but his bent was towards problems of Biblical interpretation in their bearing on the devout life. Vermigli (Peter Martyr) and Marcantonio Flaminio were leading spirits in his &quot;coterie&quot;, which included the marchioness of Pescara Vittoria Colonna (April 1490; a widow since 1525 – 25 February 1547, aged 57), since 1537, and her younger widowed sister-in-law, Giulia Gonzaga, (1513; marries 1526, aged 13; a widow since 1529, aged 16 – 16 April 1566, aged 53).

His influence was great on Ochino, for whose sermons he furnished themes. Pietro Carnesecchi, (24 December 1508 – 1 October 1567), burned by the Inquisition in 1567, who had known Valdés at Rome as &quot;a modest and well-bred courtier,&quot; found him at Naples (1540) &quot;wholly intent upon the study of Holy Scripture,&quot; translating portions into Spanish from Hebrew and Greek, with comments and introductions. To him Carnesecchi ascribes his own adoption of the Evangelical doctrine of justification by faith, and at the same time his rejection of the policy of the Lutheran schism. Valdés died at Naples in May 1541.

His death scattered his band of associates. Abandoning the hope of a regenerated Catholicism, Ochino and Vermigli left Italy. Some of Valdés&#x27;s writings were by degrees published in Italian translations. Showing much originality and penetration, they combine a delicate vein of semi-mystical spirituality with the personal charm attributed to their author in all contemporary notices. Llorente traces in Valdés the influence of Tauler; any such influence must have been at second hand. The Aviso on the interpretation of Scripture, based on Tauler, was probably the work of Alfonso. Valdés was in relations with Fra Benedetto of Mantua, the anonymous author of &quot;Del Benefizio di Gesù Cristo Crocefisso&quot;, revised by Flaminio (reprinted by Dr Babington, Cambridge, 1855).

The suggestion that Valdés departed from Catholic Orthodoxy about the Trinity was first made in 1567 by the Transylvanian bishop, Ferenc Dávid; it has been adopted by Sand (1684), Wallace (1850) and other nontrinitarian writers, and is countenanced by Bayle. To this view some colour is given by isolated expressions in his writings, and by the subsequent course of Ochino (whose heterodox repute rests, however, on the insight with which he presented objections). Gaston Bonet-Maury (1842–1919) comments: &quot;Valdés never discusses the Trinity (even when commenting on Matt, xxviii. 19), reserving it (in his &quot;Latte Spirituale&quot;) as a topic for advanced Christians; yet he explicitly affirms the consubstantiality of the Son, whom he unites in doxologies with the Father and the Holy Spirit&quot; (Opusc. p. 145). Practical theology interested him more than speculative, his aim being the promotion of a healthy and personal piety.

<doc id="101392" wikidata="Q2061" url="?curid=101392" title="Yellowknife">
<text>Yellowknife is the capital, largest community, and the only city in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.

Yellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe, who were known as the &quot;Copper Indians&quot; or &quot;Yellowknife Indians&quot;, today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation. They traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Modern Yellowknives members can be found in city and in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndilǫ and Dettah.

The city&#x27;s population, which is ethnically mixed, was 20,340 per the 2021 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as &quot;Sǫǫ̀mbak’è&quot; (, &quot;where the money is&quot;).

The Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries.

== History ==

The area around the community is the historic and traditional home of the Yellowknives Dene, the land&#x27;s First Nations residents. Dettah was the first formal settlement in the area, which was founded by the Yellowknives in the 1930s and located on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay. The name Dettah means Burnt Point and refers to a traditional fishing camp that the Dene used for hundreds of years. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was first occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.

A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in 1898. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.

In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada&#x27;s Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.
The following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936–1937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver &amp; Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and The Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on 5 September 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, Vic Ingraham&#x27;s first hotel, Sutherland&#x27;s Drug Store, and a pool hall.

The population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945–1946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.
Between 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife Administration district was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Crown–Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was Jock McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been called the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.

In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light—an attempt to retrieve it—was only partially successful.

A new mining rush and fourth building boom in Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991. The Giant Mine was the subject of a bombing during a labour dispute in 1992 that resulted in one of the deadliest mass murders in Canada with 9 deaths. The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On 1 April 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.

===2023 wildfire===
On August 16, 2023, the territorial government began evacuating Yellowknife as wildfires approached the city, fearing that the Yellowknife Highway (Highway 3)—the main road leading into Yellowknife—would soon be inaccessible. The government also worked with homeless residents to assist them in evacuating.

Air Canada and WestJet were initially criticized for high prices and unwaived cancellation fees for flights to and from Yellowknife, but they have since changed policies to alleviate financial burden for evacuees. Both carriers also increased the number of flights to Yellowknife.

The smoke from the 236 active wildfires in the Northwest Territories spread quickly across Canada due to powerful winds and was compared by news sources to the 2023 Hawaii wildfires, which similarly started in a dry and windy environment. , the fire was in size, at distance from the city.

On August 19, 2023, 87 percent of the city was evacuated as of 6:58 am (ET), with only 2,600 of the original 20,000 remaining, 1,000 of whom were essential workers. NWT Premier Caroline Cochrane announced that she had evacuated to Alberta to avoid taking up a space on one of the last planes to leave.

The evacuation order was rescinded 6 September and Yellowknife residents began to return later that day. An estimated 1,000 people had been flown home by September 8.

== Geography ==

Yellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife&#x27;s high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to 20 hours in June. Civil Twilight lasts all night from late May to mid-July.

=== Climate ===
Yellowknife has a subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Ecld&quot;). Although winter is predominantly polar, rapid heat waves emerge at the summit of summer due to the immense path south. The city averages less than of precipitation annually, as it lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Due to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. In an occasional year, the first fall frost does not come until October. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rainfall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.

Yellowknife experiences very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around and in July. According to Environment and Climate Change Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1,034 hours from June to August. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was on 31 January 1947, and the highest was on 2 August 2021. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June. Due to its warm summer temperatures, Yellowknife is well below the Arctic tree line in stark contrast to areas farther east in Canada on similar parallels.

In 2014, Environment Canada ranked Yellowknife as having the coldest winter and longest snow cover season, along with the sunniest spring and summer, of any city in Canada.

=== Arsenic contamination ===
The area has elevated levels of arsenic due to the region&#x27;s geology and past mining operations. The bedrock contains arsenopyrite, a naturally occurring mineral that contains arsenic, iron, and sulfur. Gold mining in the 20th century released large amounts of arsenic into the environment. The roasting process used to extract gold from arsenopyrite ores created arsenic trioxide as a byproduct, which was often released directly into the environment. 
The Giant Mine, which operated from 1948 to 2004, left behind 237,000 tonnes of arsenic trioxide waste on site. The mine is located 4 km north of Yellowknife&#x27;s city limits. The Government of the Northwest Territories is working with researchers to monitor and study arsenic levels in the area. The Giant Mine Remediation Project is a billion-dollar cleanup effort that will take about 10 years to complete. There are several ongoing programs to monitor residents for elevated levels of arsenic.

== Cityscape ==

Yellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion. Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city&#x27;s commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.

=== Houseboats ===
Jolliffe Island sits in Yellowknife Bay and is public land under the jurisdiction of the City of Yellowknife after a land purchase when Imperial Oil vacated the site. The island is surrounded by a community of houseboats, where people have been living off the grid since 1978. Their relationship with the city is complex and often strained as the houseboats are popular with sightseers, but at the same time their residents live outside of the city&#x27;s tax jurisdiction while still using city services, leading to lawsuits and tensions with the City of Yellowknife.

== Government ==

Yellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected mayor and eight councillors. The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years. The current mayor of Yellowknife is Rebecca Alty, who succeeded Mark Heyck in 2018. Alty was elected 16 October 2018 and was sworn in 5 November.

Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories. These members, referred to as MLAs, are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six cabinet ministers and a premier, which forms the Executive Council of the Northwest Territories, also known as the cabinet. In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfil a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor. The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.

The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of the Northwest Territories and has one Member of Parliament, Michael McLeod, and one Senator, Margaret Dawn Anderson. Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Yellowknife Centre, Yellowknife North and Yellowknife South ridings.

== Economy ==

As the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory. Historically, Yellowknife&#x27;s economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife&#x27;s economy.

After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife&#x27;s economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998. A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003. Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was , valued at over billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, the De Beers owned Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007. De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. The mine was officially opened on 20 September 2016, and began commercial production in March 2017. As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.
The major employers in Yellowknife include the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines, Dominion Diamonds, DeBeers Canada, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.
During winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot;.

Tourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many tourists come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the aurora. In 2004–2005, visitors to the territory spent million.
The City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).

Canadian North, a regional airline, was headquartered in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Tower in downtown. The airline announced that when its lease was to expire in the end of August 2013, the airline will vacate the office and move it and 20 employees out of Yellowknife. The airline is now headquartered in Calgary.

=== Former regional mines ===

Yellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Emergency services ===

Policing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP); Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers.
The City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is responsible for municipal bylaw infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city&#x27;s fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one may now dial 911) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dieticians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.

=== Utilities and services ===

==== Communications ====
Yellowknife&#x27;s telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that were later transferred to Bell Mobility. In 2008, northern-based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.

Yellowknife&#x27;s television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.

==== Electricity ====

Electricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems, provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC&#x27;s local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89 MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8 MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5 MW from Miramar Bluefish.

==== Solid waste services ====
Residential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) north of the city; salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.

==== Water and sewage treatment ====
The City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler&#x27;s Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.

=== Transportation ===
Yellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system.

==== Air ====

Yellowknife Airport is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passengers and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly. It has two asphalt runways, one strip and another of ; while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet. Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings. Air traffic control services, Instrument landing system (Category 1), and radar services are provided by Nav Canada.

==== Transit ====

YKTransit (formerly Yellowknife Transit) is the public transportation agency in the city, operating three regular services Monday-Saturday and one express route on weekdays. It is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.

==== Road ====

Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from . Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are on most roads, in school zones, and on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.

Until 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada&#x27;s highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River. With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on 30 November 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country. One still-used ice road connects Yellowknife with the neighbouring community of Dettah, to the southeast across an arm of Great Slave Lake; or a drive via the Ingraham Trail.

==Early life and education ==
Isaac Liev Schreiber was born on October 4, 1967, in San Francisco, California, the son of Heather Milgram, a painter, and Tell Schreiber, an actor and carpenter. His father was Protestant and his mother is Jewish. His maternal grandfather, Alex Milgram, emigrated from Ukraine. Milgram, who was the most significant male in Schreiber&#x27;s youth, played the cello and owned Pierre-Auguste Renoir etchings, and made his living by delivering meat to restaurants. His mother, who is an aficionada of classical music and Russian literature, has said that she named Liev after her favorite Russian author, Leo Tolstoy, while his father has stated that Schreiber was named after the doctor who saved his mother&#x27;s life. His family nickname, adopted when Schreiber was a baby, is &quot;Huggy&quot;.

When Schreiber was one year old, his family moved to the unincorporated rural community of Winlaw, in the southern interior of British Columbia. Over the next four years, his mother was hospitalized on several occasions and underwent therapy related to a bad experience on LSD that she had near the beginning of her marriage (in San Francisco), according to Schreiber&#x27;s father. After Schreiber&#x27;s father threatened to have Schreiber&#x27;s mother admitted to a mental institution, Schreiber was kidnapped by his mother, eventually leading to his mother gaining full custody of him. They squatted on the Lower East Side in New York City.

Schreiber has described his mother as a &quot;far-out Socialist Labor Party hippie bohemian freak who hung out with William Burroughs&quot;. She was &quot;a highly cultured eccentric&quot; who earned a living by splitting her time between driving a cab and creating &quot;papier-mâché&quot; puppets.&quot; In 1983, his mother bought him a motorcycle on his 16th birthday to &quot;promote fearlessness.&quot; The critic John Lahr wrote in a 1999 &quot;New Yorker&quot; profile that, &quot;To a large extent, Schreiber&#x27;s professional shape-shifting and his uncanny instinct for isolating the frightened, frail, goofy parts of his characters are a result of being forced to adapt to his mother&#x27;s eccentricities. It&#x27;s both his grief and his gift.&quot;

Her bohemian proclivities led to actions such as making Schreiber take the Hindu name Shiva Das, wear yoga shirts, consume a vegetarian diet, and briefly attend Satchidananda Ashram in Pomfret, Connecticut, when he was 12. Schreiber&#x27;s mother also forbade her son from seeing color films. As a result, his favorite actors were Charlie Chaplin, Andrew Cartwright, and Basil Rathbone. In retrospect, Schreiber said in a 2008 interview that he appreciates his mother&#x27;s influences, saying: &quot;Since I&#x27;ve had Sasha, I&#x27;ve completely identified with everything my mother went through raising me ... and I think her choices were inspired.&quot;

Subsequently, Schreiber attended Friends Seminary, a Quaker school. In high school, played the bass clarinet.

Schreiber went on to attend Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he began his acting training at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, through the Five Colleges consortium. In March 1989, he played Antonio in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; alongside Jeffrey Donovan. He later attended the Yale School of Drama, where he studied with Earle R. Gister and starred in Charles Evered&#x27;s &quot;The Size of the World,&quot; directed by Walton Jones. He received a master&#x27;s degree in drama from Yale in 1992. He also attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. He originally wanted to be a screenwriter, eventually settling on acting.

==Career==
===1992–2004: Early work and breakthrough ===

In 1992 Schreiber acted in the comedic play &quot;Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet)&quot; by Ann-Marie MacDonald at the Classic Stage Company. The following year he made his Broadway debut as Eliot in the Jane Bowles play &quot;In the Summer House&quot; (1994) acting opposite Frances Conroy. That same year he made his feature film debut as Chris, a depressed trans woman in the Nora Ephron directed dark comedy film &quot;Mixed Nuts&quot; (1994) starring Steve Martin. In 1995 he had supporting roles in the independent films &quot;Mad Love&quot; and &quot;Party Girl&quot;. His first leading film roles in the Greg Mottola comedy-drama &quot;The Daytrippers&quot; and Nicole Holofcener&#x27;s &quot;Walking and Talking&quot; were both released in 1996. Following Schreiber&#x27;s string of supporting roles in various independent films, his big break came when he played the accused murderer Cotton Weary in the &quot;Scream&quot; trilogy of horror films. Though the success of the &quot;Scream&quot; trilogy led Schreiber to roles in several big-budget studio pictures, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote in 2007 that &quot;Schreiber is [still] best known for such indie gems as &quot;Walking and Talking&quot;, &quot;The Daytrippers&quot;, and &quot;Big Night&quot;.&quot;

After &quot;Scream,&quot; Schreiber was cast as Orson Welles in the HBO film &quot;RKO 281&quot; (1999). Laura Fries of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of his performance, &quot;Schreiber, as Welles, manages to capture the essence of a man of many passions, and creates a nice balance of hubris and self-loathing to give the part real depth&quot;. He earned nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. He then played supporting roles in several studio films, including Ron Howard&#x27;s 1996 remake of &quot;Ransom&quot;, the 1999 film &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, &quot;A Walk on the Moon&quot; (1999), the 2000 film adaptation of &quot;Hamlet&quot; starring Ethan Hawke, and as a spy in &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; (2002) acting opposite Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman. He provided the narration for the HBO Special &quot;Do You Believe in Miracles? The Story of the 1980 U.S. Hockey Team&quot; about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey team. He played the time-traveling ex-boyfriend of Meg Ryan in the romantic comedy-fantasy film &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; (2001), also starring Hugh Jackman. The 2004 remake of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, with Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep, was another major film for Schreiber, stirring some controversy as it opened during a heated presidential election cycle.

Schreiber has narrated several documentaries, many of them aired as part of PBS series such as &quot;American Experience&quot;, &quot;Nova&quot;, and &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; from 2001 to 2011. He is the voice behind the television commercials for Infiniti. In 1995, he provided narration for the BBC/WGBH documentary co-production &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. In 1994, he narrated &quot;Two Billion Hearts&quot;, the official film of 1994 FIFA World Cup.

Along with his screen work, Schreiber is a well-respected classical actor; in a 1998 review of the Shakespeare play &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called his performance &quot;revelatory&quot; and ended the article with the plea, &quot;More Shakespeare, Mr. Schreiber.&quot; A year later, Schreiber played the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot; in a December 1999 revival at The Public Theater, to similar raves. In 2000, he went on to play Laertes in the film &quot;Hamlet&quot;, a modern adaptation of the play. His performance in the title role of &quot;Henry V&quot; in a 2003 Central Park production of that play caused &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine critic John Lahr to expound upon his aptitude for playing Shakespeare characters. &quot;He has a swiftness of mind,&quot; Lahr wrote, &quot;which convinces the audience that language is being coined in the moment. His speech, unlike that of the merely adequate supporting cast, feels lived rather than learned.&quot;

Schreiber told &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1999, &quot;I don&#x27;t know that I want to be an actor for the rest of my life.&quot; For a time in the late 1990s, he hoped to produce and direct an adaptation of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; starring Dustin Hoffman. During that time, Schreiber started writing a screenplay about his relationship with his Ukrainian grandfather, a project he abandoned when, according to &quot;The New York Times,&quot; &quot;he read Jonathan Safran Foer&#x27;s hit novel, &quot;Everything Is Illuminated,&quot; and decided Mr. Foer had done it better.&quot; Schreiber&#x27;s film adaptation of the short story from which the novel originated, which he both wrote and directed, was released in 2005. The film, which starred Elijah Wood, received lukewarm-to-positive reviews, with Roger Ebert calling it &quot;a film that grows in reflection.&quot; In 2002, he starred in Neil LaBute&#x27;s play &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; along with Sigourney Weaver off-Broadway that was critically and commercially very successful.

=== 2005–2012: Broadway and film roles ===

In the spring of 2005, Schreiber played the role of Richard Roma in the Broadway revival of David Mamet&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;. David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; praised his ability to make the role his own writing, &quot;Perhaps even more impressive is Schreiber, who boldly erases any residue of either Al Pacino in the movie or Joe Mantegna in the original Broadway cast as supremely confident Roma.&quot; Schreiber went on to win the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. In 2006, Schreiber was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In the fall of that year, he directed and starred in the &quot;2006 Join the Fight&quot; AIDS campaign for Cable Positive and Kismet Films (others involved with the campaign included actress Naomi Watts, fashion designer Calvin Klein, and playwright Tony Kushner). Schreiber played Charlie Townsend in the 2006 film &quot;The Painted Veil,&quot; starring opposite Watts and Edward Norton. The film was adapted from the W. Somerset Maugham 1925 novel of the same name. In the same year, Schreiber also played Robert Thorn with Julia Stiles in the 2006 film &quot;The Omen&quot;, a remake of the 1976 horror classic. On television, the actor appeared on &quot;&quot; (2006–07 season), portraying Michael Keppler, a seasoned CSI with a strong reputation in various police departments across the nation, before temporarily replacing Gil Grissom (played by William Petersen) on the veteran Las Vegas team. Schreiber joined the cast on January 18, 2007, and shot a four-episode arc. He played a social worker in the HBO film &quot;Lackawanna Blues&quot; based on the play of the same name by Ruben Santiago-Hudson. He acted opposite S. Epatha Merkerson, Jeffrey Wright, Terrence Howard, Louis Gossett Jr., Carmen Ejogo, and Michael K. Williams.

From June to July 2006, he played the title role in &quot;Macbeth&quot; opposite Jennifer Ehle at the Delacorte Theater. &quot;Variety&quot; critic David Rooney praised his performance, writing: &quot;The complexities behind Macbeth’s surrender to evil and to overpowering destiny are compellingly embodied in Schreiber’s contained performance&quot;. He appeared in the Broadway revival of Eric Bogosian&#x27;s &quot;Talk Radio&quot;, portraying shock jock Barry Champlain. The show began previews at the Longacre Theatre on February 15, 2007, in preparation for its March opening. On May 11, 2007, he won the Drama League Award for distinguished performance in &quot;Talk Radio,&quot; and has received Tony, Drama Desk, and Outer Critics Circle Award nominations for the role. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Ben Brantley called his performance &quot;the most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting.&quot; Schreiber played the womanizing Lotario Thurgot in Mike Newell&#x27;s 2007 screen adaptation of &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera,&quot;. In a January 2007 interview, Schreiber mentioned that he was working on a screenplay. Late in 2008, Schreiber portrayed Jewish resistance fighter Zus Bielski in the film &quot;Defiance&quot;, alongside Daniel Craig. In 2009, Schreiber played the mutant supervillain Victor Creed in the Marvel Comics film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;.
In 2009 Schreiber took the role of the head of the CIA in the action thriller film &quot;Salt&quot; starring Angelina Jolie which was a commercial box office hit. That same year he acted the musical comedy-drama &quot;Taking Woodstock&quot; directed by Ang Lee based on the memoir, &quot;Taking Woodstock: A True Story of a Riot, a Concert and a Life&quot;. It premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival to mixed reviews. He is also the voice of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Sports of the 20th Century&quot; documentaries. He is the narrator of HBO Boxing&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;24/7&quot; documentary series. He narrated &quot;Magic &amp; Bird: A Courtship of Rivals&quot; and &quot;Broad Street Bullies&quot; in 2010 as well as &quot;Runnin&#x27; Rebels of UNLV&quot; in 2011, on HBO, and provided the narration for the &quot;Making of Pumping Iron&quot; documentary included in a special anniversary edition of the film &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;. He also narrated the History Channel specials &quot;Ape to Man&quot;, &quot;The Lost Kennedy Home Movies&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Schreiber reprised his role as narrator for HBO&#x27;s &quot;24/7: Road to the Winter Classic&quot; NHL documentary, which followed the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals as they prepared to face each other in the 2011 NHL Winter Classic at Heinz Field, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 1, 2011. Schreiber has been the narrator in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Hard Knocks&quot; for every season, except for the 2007 season when Paul Rudd filled that role, with the Kansas City Chiefs.

In March 2010, he expressed interest in returning for &quot;Scream 4&quot;, portraying Cotton Weary a fourth time (the film was subsequently made without his involvement). In 2010, he returned to Broadway playing Eddie Carbone, the tragic protagonist in the revival of the Arthur Miller play &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; acting opposite Scarlett Johansson. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised him writing, &quot;Mr. Schreiber registers changes in emotional temperature with organic physical precision&quot;. He received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Play losing to Denzel Washington for the August Wilson revival &quot;Fences&quot;. He also narrated the 2011 documentary &quot;Hitler&#x27;s G.I. Death Camp&quot; on the National Geographic Channel. Released in 2012, &quot;Kinderblock 66: Return to Buchenwald&quot; was narrated by Schreiber, as was the 2013 documentary &quot;Money for Nothing: Inside the Federal Reserve&quot;. He provided the voiceover for the 2018 Kia Stinger GT commercial. Once again, Schreiber was the narrator for the HBO series, &quot;24/7: Road to the Winter Classic&quot;. That year, the Philadelphia Flyers and the New York Rangers battled in the Classic, at Citizens Bank Park in the 2012 NHL Winter Classic. Once more, Schreiber narrated for the HBO series in 2014 for the 2014 NHL Winter Classic, which showcased the Toronto Maple Leafs against the Detroit Red Wings at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

=== 2013–2020: &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; ===

Starting in 2013 Schreiber starred in the title role in the crime drama series &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; on Showtime. He also acted as a writer, director and producer on the series. He earned three nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and four nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama. Tim Goodwin of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised the series in 2013 writing that &quot;Schreiber...is magnetic in every scene, as a Hollywood “fixer&quot;, and complimented the chemistry between Schreiber and Jon Voight. The series ran for seven seasons, ending in 2020. Schreiber narrated &quot;Superheroes: A Never-Ending Battle&quot;, a three-hour documentary that premiered on PBS in October 2013. In 2013 he portrayed Lyndon B. Johnson in the historical drama &quot;The Butler&quot; and appeared in the John Turturro directed comedy &quot;Fading Gigolo&quot; starring Woody Allen and Sofia Vergara. The following year he played Russian chess grandmaster Boris Spassky in the Bobby Fischer drama &quot;Pawn Sacrifice&quot; (2014). Schreiber played &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; journalist Martin Baron in the drama film &quot;Spotlight&quot; (2015). He won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture alongside Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, and Stanley Tucci.
In 2016 he starred as the professional boxer Chuck Wepner in the film &quot;Chuck&quot; which he also wrote and produced. The film premiered at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival to positive reviews. Schreiber returned to Broadway playing the Machiavellian seducer Vicomte de Valmont acting alongside Janet McTeer in the 2016 revival &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot;. The play ran from October 2016 to January 2017. Marilyn Stasio of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the production a mixed review, and wrote of his performance, &quot;[He] is a strong actor and a studly kind of male, and despite a constricting costume and skull-pinching wig, he exudes a modern manliness that hardly suits the effete Valmont.&quot; That same year Schreiber returned to play Ross &quot;The Boss&quot; Rhea in the sports comedy &quot;&quot;, a sequel to the 2011 film &quot;Goon&quot; of which he also acted in. In 2016 he played Victor Lustig in the Comedy Central sketch series &quot;Drunk History&quot;. During the story development for &quot;Logan&quot;, Liev had been approached about the potential of Victor Creed to return to the &quot;X-Men&quot; film universe. Following the film&#x27;s release, Hugh Jackman revealed that early versions of the script included the character but that element was eventually removed from the final screenplay. In 2017, Liev was cast to voice the Storm King, the main antagonist in the 2017 film &quot;My Little Pony: The Movie&quot;, based on the show &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot;. On his acceptance of the part, Live said that, because of his children&#x27;s exposure to his adult-oriented film work, he wanted something more child-friendly for them to watch.

In 2018, he was part of the ensemble cast of the animated film &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; directed by Wes Anderson, which premiered at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival, and voiced the supervillain Kingpin in the animated film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;. In the year 2019, Schreiber had a supporting role in &quot;A Rainy Day in New York&quot;, which was written and directed by Woody Allen. The same year, he starred in the lead role for &quot;Human Capital&quot;, where he also served as a producer.

=== 2021–present: Return to Broadway ===
In 2020, Showtime ended &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; after its seventh season. As a conclusion to the series, a Ray Donovan film was released in January 2022. Schreiber co-wrote the script along with the director David Hollander. In a second collaboration with filmmaker Wes Anderson, he appeared in &quot;The French Dispatch&quot; in the role of an unnamed talk show host. The film was originally set to be released in 2020, but it was delayed numerous times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film ultimately premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on July 12 and was released theatrically in the U.S. on October 22, 2021. Schreiber worked on a film adaptation of &quot;Across the River and Into the Trees&quot;.
