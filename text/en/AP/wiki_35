<text>A binary image is a digital image that consists of pixels that can have one of exactly two colors, usually black and white. Each pixel is stored as a single bit — i.e. either a 0 or 1.

A binary image can be stored in memory as a bitmap: a packed array of bits. A binary image of 640×480 pixels has a file size of only 37.5 KiB, and most also compress well with simple run-length compression. A binary image format is often used in contexts where it is important to have a small file size for transmission or storage, or due to color limitations on displays or printers.

It also has technical and artistic applications, for example in digital image processing and pixel art. Binary images can be interpreted as subsets of the two-dimensional integer lattice &quot;Z&quot;2; the field of morphological image processing was largely inspired by this view.

== Terminology ==
Binary images are also called &quot;bi-level&quot; or &quot;two-level&quot;. Pixel art made up of two colours is often referred to as &quot;1-bit&quot; in reference to the single bit required to store each pixel. The names &quot;black-and-white&quot;, &quot;B&amp;W&quot;, &quot;monochrome&quot; or &quot;monochromatic&quot; are often used, but can also designate other image types with only one sample per pixel, such as grayscale images. In Photoshop parlance, a binary image is the same as an image in &quot;Bitmap&quot; color mode.

== Operations on binary images ==
An entire class of operations on binary images operates on a 3×3 window of the image. This contains nine pixels, so 29 or 512 possible values. Considering only the central pixel, it is possible to define whether it remains set or unset, based on the surrounding pixels. Examples of such operations are thinning, dilating, finding branch points and endpoints, removing isolated pixels, shifting the image a pixel in any direction, and breaking H-connections. Conway&#x27;s Game of Life is also an example of a 3×3 window operation.

Another class of operations is based on the notion of filtering with a structuring element. The structuring element is binary image, usually small, which is passed over the target image, in a similar manner to a filter in gray scale image processing. Since the pixels can only have two values, the morphological operations are erosion (any unset pixels within the structuring element cause the pixel to be unset) and dilation (any set pixels within the structuring element cause the pixel to be set). Important operations are morphological opening and morphological closing which consist of erosion followed by dilation and dilation followed by erosion, respectively, using the same structuring element. Opening tends to enlarge small holes, remove small objects, and separate objects. Closing retains small objects, removes holes, and joins objects.

A very important characteristic of a binary image is the distance transform. This gives the distance of every set pixel from the nearest unset pixel. The distance transform can be efficiently calculated. It allows efficient computation of Voronoi diagrams, where each pixel in an image is assigned to the nearest of a set of points. It also allows skeletonization, which differs from thinning in that skeletons allow recovery of the original image. The distance transform is also useful for determining the center of the object, and for matching in image recognition.

Another class of operations is gathering orientation-free metrics. This is often important in image recognition where the orientation of the camera needs to be removed. Orientation-free metrics of a group of connected or surrounded pixels include the Euler number, the perimeter, the area, the compactness, the area of holes, the minimum radius, the maximum radius.

=== Image segmentation ===
Binary images are produced from color images by segmentation. Segmentation is the process of assigning each pixel in the source image to two or more classes. If there are more than two classes then the usual result is several binary images. The simplest form of segmentation is probably Otsu&#x27;s method which assigns pixels to foreground or background based on grayscale intensity. Another method is the watershed algorithm. Edge detection also often creates a binary image with some pixels assigned to edge pixels, and is also a first step in further segmentation.

=== Skeletons ===
Thinning or skeletonization produces binary images which consist of pixel-wide lines. The branchpoints and endpoints can then be extracted, and the image converted to a graph. This is important in image recognition, for example in optical character recognition.

=== Interpretation ===
The interpretation of the pixel&#x27;s binary value is also device-dependent. Some systems interprets the bit value of 0 as black and 1 as white, while others reversed the meaning of the values. In the TWAIN standard PC interface for scanners and digital cameras, the first flavor is called &quot;vanilla&quot; and the reversed one &quot;chocolate&quot;.

Dithering is often used for displaying halftone images.

== Usages ==
=== 1-bit pixel art ===

Binary pixelart, better known as &quot;1-Bit&quot; or &quot;1bit&quot; art, has been a method of displaying graphics since early computers. While
early computers such as the ZX81 used the restriction as a necessity of the hardware, hand-held LCD games such as Game &amp; Watch and Tamagotchi, alongside early computers with a focus on graphic user interfaces like the Macintosh made large steps in promoting the culture, technique and aesthetic of the restrictions of 1-bit art.

Modern examples of 1bit art are visible in indie videogames and other digital art. Best-seller games like &quot;Gato Roboto&quot;, &quot;Return of the Obra Dinn&quot;, &quot;Minit&quot; and &quot;World of Horror&quot; use 1bit as a style to give their games a retro feel or to simply save the graphic designers time in development. There is even new 1-Bit hardware in development, such as the experimental handheld console Playdate.

For pixel artists, 1-Bit has become a common challenge for creating art. The pixelart contest &quot;Pixtogether&quot; required its participants to use only two colours for its 10th monthly contest. Not a lot of artists mainly do 1bit art, but many of them stay in contact with each other to exchange knowledge about working with the restriction, and hosting own collaborations.

Brandon James Greer, who makes popular YouTube tutorials on 1bit and other pixel artwork, says that &quot;the restriction leads to some unique approaches&quot; and that working in 1-Bit is &quot;a very fun and unique challenge&quot;.

While 1bit can be called an art style itself, each piece falls under a second style too. Obvious differences in 1bit art styles are for example whether, how much and what kind of dithering is being used, the image resolution, the use of outlines and how detailed the artwork is.

=== Computer peripherals ===
Some input/output devices, such as laser printers, fax machines, and bi-level computer displays, can only handle binary images.

=== Early mobile computing and internet ===
In 1999, the Wireless Application Protocol Forum introduced the standard for the .wbmp (wireless bitmap) file format as part of the standards for displaying WAP pages.

=== Visual cryptography ===
In 1994, Moni Naor and Adi Shamir demonstrated a visual secret sharing scheme, where a binary image was broken up into &quot;n&quot; shares so that only someone with all &quot;n&quot; shares could decrypt the image, while any shares revealed no information about the original image. Each share was printed on a separate transparency, and decryption was performed by overlaying the shares. When all &quot;n&quot; shares were overlaid, the original image would appear. There are several generalizations of the basic scheme including &quot;k&quot;-out-of-&quot;n&quot; visual cryptography, and using opaque sheets but illuminating them by multiple sets of identical illumination patterns under the recording of only one single-pixel detector.

=== Digital image editing ===
Binary images often arise in digital image processing of more complex images, in the form of masks, as a result of thresholding, and for use in dithering.

=== Oversampled binary image sensors ===
An oversampled binary image sensor is a digital image sensor reminiscent of traditional photographic film. Each pixel in the sensor has a binary response, giving only a one-bit quantized measurement of the local light intensity.

<doc id="97929" wikidata="Q1756475" url="?curid=97929" title="Metal matrix composite">
<text>In materials science, a metal matrix composite (MMC) is a composite material with fibers or particles dispersed in a metallic matrix, such as copper, aluminum, or steel. The secondary phase is typically a ceramic (such as alumina or silicon carbide) or another metal (such as steel). They are typically classified according to the type of reinforcement: short discontinuous fibers (whiskers), continuous fibers, or particulates. There is some overlap between MMCs and cermets, with the latter typically consisting of less than 20% metal by volume. When at least three materials are present, it is called a hybrid composite. MMCs can have much higher strength-to-weight ratios, stiffness, and ductility than traditional materials, so they are often used in demanding applications. MMCs typically have lower thermal and electrical conductivity and poor resistance to radiation, limiting their use in the very harshest environments.

== Composition==
MMCs are made by dispersing a reinforcing material into a metal matrix. The reinforcement surface can be coated to prevent a chemical reaction with the matrix. For example, carbon fibers are commonly used in aluminium matrix to synthesize composites showing low density and high strength. However, carbon reacts with aluminium to generate a brittle and water-soluble compound Al4C3 on the surface of the fiber. To prevent this reaction, the carbon fibers are coated with nickel or titanium boride.

=== Matrix ===
The matrix is the monolithic material into which the reinforcement is embedded, and is completely continuous. This means that there is a path through the matrix to any point in the material, unlike two materials sandwiched together. In structural applications, the matrix is usually a lighter metal such as aluminum, magnesium, or titanium, and provides a complete support for the reinforcement. In high-temperature applications, cobalt and cobalt–nickel alloy matrices are common.

=== Reinforcement ===
The reinforcement material is embedded into a matrix. The reinforcement does not always serve a purely structural task (reinforcing the compound), but is also used to change physical properties such as wear resistance, friction coefficient, or thermal conductivity. The reinforcement can be either continuous or discontinuous. Discontinuous MMCs can be isotropic and can be worked with standard metalworking techniques, such as extrusion, forging, or rolling. In addition, they may be machined using conventional techniques, but commonly would need the use of polycrystalline diamond tooling (PCD).

Continuous reinforcement uses monofilament wires or fibers such as carbon fiber or silicon carbide. Because the fibers are embedded into the matrix in a certain direction, the result is an anisotropic structure in which the alignment of the material affects its strength. One of the first MMCs used boron filament as reinforcement. Discontinuous reinforcement uses &quot;whiskers&quot;, short fibers, or particles. The most common reinforcing materials in this category are alumina and silicon carbide.

== Manufacturing and forming methods ==
MMC manufacturing can be broken into three types—solid, liquid, and vapor.

=== Solid state methods ===
* Powder blending and consolidation (powder metallurgy): Powdered metal and discontinuous reinforcement are mixed and then bonded through a process of compaction, degassing, and thermo-mechanical treatment (possibly via hot isostatic pressing (HIP) or extrusion)
* Foil diffusion bonding: Layers of metal foil are sandwiched with long fibers, and then pressed through to form a matrix

=== Liquid state methods ===
* Electroplating and electroforming: A solution containing metal ions loaded with reinforcing particles is co-deposited forming a composite material
* Stir casting: Discontinuous reinforcement is stirred into molten metal, which is allowed to solidify
* Pressure infiltration: Molten metal is infiltrated into the reinforcement through use a kind of pressure such as gas pressure
* Squeeze casting: Molten metal is injected into a form with fibers pre-placed inside it
* Spray deposition: Molten metal is sprayed onto a continuous fiber substrate
* Reactive processing: A chemical reaction occurs, with one of the reactants forming the matrix and the other the reinforcement

=== Semi-solid state methods ===
* Semi-solid powder processing: Powder mixture is heated up to semi-solid state and pressure is applied to form the composites.

=== Vapor deposition ===
* Physical vapor deposition: The fiber is passed through a thick cloud of vaporized metal, coating it.

=== In-situ fabrication technique ===
* Controlled unidirectional solidification of a eutectic alloy can result in a two-phase microstructure with one of the phases, present in lamellar or fiber form, distributed in the matrix.

== Residual stress ==
MMCs are fabricated at elevated temperatures, which is an essential condition for diffusion bonding of the fiber/matrix interface. Later on, when they are cooled down to the ambient temperature, residual stresses (RS) are generated in the composite due to the mismatch between the coefficients of the metal matrix and fiber. The manufacturing RS significantly influence the mechanical behavior of the MMCs in all loading conditions. In some cases, thermal RS are high enough to initiate plastic deformation within the matrix during the manufacturing process.

== Effect on Mechanical Properties ==
The addition of ceramic particles in general increases the strength of the material while having a tradeoff on material ductility. For example, a Al-Al2O3 composite can increase the yield strength of cast Al 6061 alloys from 105 to 120 MPa and increase the young’s modulus from 70 to 95 GPa. However, the composite had negative effects on the ductility decreasing it from 10% to 2%. Ultimately, the increase in elastic modulus is significant because the metals get the benefit of the higher specific stiffness of ceramics while retaining some ductility. Metal-matrix composites can also significantly increase the wear resistance and hardness of aluminum alloys. Al2O3 particles were found to significantly increase the wear resistance of an Al-Si alloy, and SiO2 particles increased the hardness of a Al-Mg alloy significantly. The application of this is in light, wear-resistant alloys for wear components such as piston liners in automobile engines. Current aluminum alloys are soft and often require hard, heavy cast iron liners which reduces the benefits of the lightweight aluminum engines. 

Fracture toughness of the composites is typically dominated by the metal phases; however, it can also be dominated by the ceramic phase or delamination depending on the material system. For example the Cu/Al2O3 system has a high thermal expansion mismatch causing localized stresses encouraging crack propagation in the form of delamination. This significantly inhibits its fracture toughness compared to other compositions. In an Al/Al2O3 co-continuous system the crack propagated through the ceramic phase and was deflected upon reaching interfaces with the metallic phases. As a result, more energy was needed to deflect the crack around the phases and the composite was significantly toughened. Overall, fracture toughness is largely dependent on MMC composition due to thermal mismatch and crack modes but can toughen composites with low thermal mismatch.

MMCs strengthen materials against plasticity for a variety of reasons. The first is direct load transfer to the stronger ceramic particles. The second is due to the difference in plastic deformation of the two components. This causes a dislocation to become pinned on the stronger particles and bow around them to continue moving. Dislocations typically drive plastic deformation due to the lower energy to move them rather than moving an entire plane of atoms. Therefore, pinning them causes a large increase in the energy and stress required for plastic deformation (see Precipitation hardening). The final mechanism is caused by the stress from thermal and coherency mismatch. This creates a stress field which traps dislocations creating a pileup further inhibiting plastic deformation.

== Applications ==

* High performance tungsten carbide cutting tools are made from a tough cobalt matrix cementing the hard tungsten carbide particles; lower performance tools can use other metals such as bronze as the matrix.
* Some tank armors may be made from metal matrix composites, probably steel reinforced with boron nitride, which is a good reinforcement for steel because it is very stiff and it does not dissolve in molten steel.
* Some automotive disc brakes use MMCs. Early Lotus Elise models used aluminum MMC rotors, but they have less than optimal heat properties, and Lotus has since switched back to cast iron. Modern high-performance sport cars, such as those built by Porsche, use rotors made of carbon fiber within a silicon carbide matrix because of its high specific heat and thermal conductivity. 3M developed a preformed aluminum matrix insert for strengthening cast aluminum disc brake calipers, reducing weight by half compared to cast iron while retaining similar stiffness. 3M has also used alumina preforms for AMC pushrods.
* Cosworth uses a Metal matrix composite piston for their Cosworth GMA V12 engine on the Gordon Murray Automotive T.50 and Gordon Murray Automotive T.33 supercars. 
* Ford offers a Metal Matrix Composite (MMC) driveshaft upgrade. The MMC driveshaft is made of an aluminum matrix reinforced with boron carbide, allowing the critical speed of the driveshaft to be raised by reducing inertia. The MMC driveshaft has become a common modification for racers, allowing the top speed to be increased far beyond the safe operating speeds of a standard aluminum driveshaft.
* Honda has used aluminum matrix composite cylinder liners in some of their engines, including the B21A1, H22A and H23A, F20C and F22C, and the C32B used in the NSX.
* Toyota has since used metal matrix composites in the Yamaha-designed 2ZZ-GE engine which is used in the later Lotus Lotus Elise S2 versions as well as Toyota car models, including the eponymous Toyota Matrix. Porsche also uses MMCs to reinforce the engine&#x27;s cylinder sleeves in the Boxster and 911.
* The F-16 Fighting Falcon uses monofilament silicon carbide fibers in a titanium matrix for a structural component of the jet&#x27;s landing gear.
* Specialized Bicycles has used aluminum MMC compounds for its top of the range bicycle frames for several years. Griffen Bicycles also made boron carbide-aluminum MMC bike frames, and Univega briefly did so as well.
* Some equipment in particle accelerators such as Radio Frequency Quadrupoles (RFQs) or electron targets use copper MMC compounds such as Glidcop to retain the material properties of copper at high temperatures and radiation levels.
* Copper-silver alloy matrix containing 55% by volume diamond particles, known as Dymalloy, is used as a substrate for high-power, high-density multi-chip modules in electronics for its very high thermal conductivity. AlSiC is an aluminium-silicon carbide composite for similar applications.
* Aluminium-Graphite composites are used in power electronic modules because of their high thermal conductivity, the adjustable coefficient of thermal expansion and the low density.

MMCs are nearly always more expensive than the more conventional materials they are replacing. As a result, they are found where improved properties and performance can justify the added cost. Today these applications are found most often in aircraft components, space systems and high-end or &quot;boutique&quot; sports equipment. The scope of applications will certainly increase as manufacturing costs are reduced.

In comparison with conventional polymer matrix composites, MMCs are resistant to fire, can operate in wider range of temperatures, do not absorb moisture, have better electrical and thermal conductivity, are resistant to radiation damage, and do not display outgassing. On the other hand, MMCs tend to be more expensive, the fiber-reinforced materials may be difficult to fabricate, and the available experience in use is limited.

<text>Omagh (; from , meaning &#x27;the virgin plain&#x27;) is the county town of County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It is situated where the rivers Drumragh and Camowen meet to form the Strule. Northern Ireland&#x27;s capital city, Belfast, is 68 miles (109.5 km) to the east of Omagh, and Derry is 34 miles (55 km) to the north.

The town had a population of 20,458 at the 2021 census. At the time of 2011 census, the former district council, which was the largest in County Tyrone, had a population of 51,356. Omagh contains the headquarters of the Western Education and Library Board, and also houses offices for the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs at Sperrin House, the Department for Infrastructure and the Northern Ireland Roads Service at the Tyrone County Hall and the Northern Ireland Land &amp; Property Services at Boaz House.

==History==

===Name===
The name Omagh is an anglicisation of the Irish name &quot;an Óghmaigh&quot; (modern Irish &quot;an Ómaigh&quot;), meaning &quot;the virgin plain&quot;. A monastery was apparently established on the site of the town about 792, and a Franciscan friary was founded in 1464. Omagh was founded as a town in 1610. It served as a refuge for fugitives from the east of County Tyrone during the 1641 Rebellion. In 1689, James II arrived at Omagh, en route to Derry. Supporters of William III, Prince of Orange, later burned the town.

===County Town===

In 1768, Omagh replaced Dungannon as the county town of County Tyrone. Omagh acquired railway links to Londonderry with the Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway in 1852, Enniskillen in 1853 and Belfast in 1861. St Lucia Barracks were completed in 1881. In 1899, Tyrone County Hospital was opened. The Government of Northern Ireland made the Great Northern Railway Board close the Omagh – Enniskillen railway line in 1957. In accordance with the Benson Report submitted to the Northern Ireland Government in 1963, the Ulster Transport Authority closed the – Omagh – Londonderry main line in 1965, leaving Tyrone with no rail service. St Lucia Barracks closed in August 2007.

On 30 December 1942, a Consolidated Catalina Ib of No. 240 Squadron RAF that was operating from RAF Killadeas crashed into the town. The crash killed all eleven occupants, however no one on the ground was killed or injured. The cause of the crash was never ascertained.

Omagh Town Hall, which opened on 29 September 1915, hosted a number of notable performers, including the actors Anew McMaster, Micheál Mac Liammóir and Jimmy O&#x27;Dea, before it was demolished to make way for the Strule Arts Centre in 1997.

===The Troubles===

Omagh became the focus of international media attention when, on 15 August 1998, the Real Irish Republican Army exploded a car bomb in the town centre. 29 people were killed in the blast – 14 women (including one pregnant with twins), 9 children and 6 men. Hundreds more were injured as a result of the blast.

In April 2011, a car bomb killed police constable Ronan Kerr. A group of former Provisional IRA members calling itself the Irish Republican Army made its first public statement later that month claiming responsibility for the killing.

In February 2023, an off-duty senior police officer was shot and critically injured at a sports complex in the town. Police stated they were focusing on the New IRA.

Omagh has a history of flooding and suffered major floods in 1909, 1929, 1954, 1969, 1987, 1999 and, most recently, 12 June 2007. Flood-walls have been built to keep the water in the channel (River Strule) and to prevent it from overflowing into the flood plain. Large areas of land, mainly around the meanders, are unsuitable for development and were developed into large, green open areas, walking routes and parks. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

==Economy==
===Retail===

Omagh is the main retail centre for Tyrone, as well as the West of Ulster (behind Derry and Letterkenny), due to its central location. In the period 2000–2003, over £80 million was invested in Omagh, and of new retail space was created. Shopping areas in Omagh include the Main Street, Great Northern Road Retail Park and the Showgrounds Retail Park on Sedan Avenue in the town centre. Market Street/High Street is also a prominent shopping street, which includes high street stores such as DV8 and Primark.

=== Events and culture ===
Strule Arts Centre is an example of urban renewal in Omagh town centre. Opened in 2007, this civic building is located in a newly created public space which was reclaimed from a formerly disused area between the River Strule and High Street.

The Mid Ulster Film Festival, established in 2004, took place in Omagh until its cancellation in 2010.

==Places of interest==

The &#x27;Omagh Accessible Shared Inclusive Space&#x27; (OASIS), a £4.5 million facelift for Omagh&#x27;s riverbank, was funded by the European Union and planning approved in 2013. Construction began in March 2014, and the OASIS plaza was officially opened in June 2015.

The Ulster American Folk Park, near Omagh, includes the cottage where Thomas Mellon was born (in 1813) before his family emigrated to Pennsylvania in the United States. His son, Andrew W. Mellon, became secretary of the US Treasury. The park is an open-air museum that explores the journey made by the Irish (specifically those from Ulster) to America during the 1800s. The park is used to host seasonal events and also hosts a Bluegrass festival every year. Over 127,000 people visited the park in 2003.

The Gortin Glens Forest Park, north of Omagh, is a large forest with a deer enclosure and several waterfalls and lakes.

Several areas alongside the River Strule have also been developed into open areas.

==Transport==
=== Former railways ===
As of the 21st century, neither the town nor the district of Omagh has any railway service.

The Irish gauge Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway (L&amp;ER) opened as far as Omagh on 3 September 1852 and was extended to Enniskillen in 1854. The Portadown, Dungannon and Omagh Junction Railway (PD&amp;O) reached Omagh in 1861, completing the Portadown – Derry route that came to be informally called &quot;The Derry Road&quot;. The Great Northern Railway (Ireland) absorbed the PD&amp;O in 1876 and the L&amp;ER in 1883.

The Government of Northern Ireland made the GNR Board close the Omagh – Enniskillen line in 1957. The Ulster Transport Authority took over the GNR&#x27;s remaining lines in Northern Ireland in 1958. In accordance with The Benson Report submitted to the Northern Ireland Government in 1963, the UTA closed the &quot;Derry Road&quot; through Omagh on 15 February 1965. Later the Omagh Throughpass road was built on the disused trackbed through Omagh railway station.

==Education==
Omagh has a number of educational institutions at different levels. These include at least 10 primary schools. 

The town was previously the headquarters of the Western Education and Library Board (WELB), located at Campsie House on the Hospital Road, before all local education boards in Northern Ireland were combined into the Education Authority in 2015.

===Secondary schools===
Grammar and secondary schools in the area include Christian Brothers Grammar School, Drumragh Integrated College, Loreto Grammar School, Omagh Academy, Omagh High School and Sacred Heart College.

The Department for Education proposed to co-locate Omagh&#x27;s six existing secondary schools on the former 190-acre St Lucia Army Barracks, as one large shared educational campus. In April 2009, at the inaugural Lisanelly Shared Educational Campus Steering Group meeting held in Arvalee School and Resource Centre, the Education Minister, Caitríona Ruane announced that funding had been allocated for exemplar designs and associated technical work for a shared educational campus. The construction was expected to cost in excess of £120 million. As of March 2022, the shared education campus was scheduled to open in 2026.

A campus of South West College, known until 2007 as the Omagh College of Further Education, is located in the town centre.

Healy Park is the home of Tyrone GAA and the county&#x27;s largest and main sports stadium located on the Gortin Road, has a capacity nearing 25,000, and had the distinction of being the first Gaelic-games stadium in Ulster to have floodlights.

<doc id="98012" wikidata="Q702056" url="?curid=98012" title="Charter Oath">
<text>The was promulgated on 6 April 1868 in Kyoto Imperial Palace. The Oath outlined the main aims and the course of action to be followed during Emperor Meiji&#x27;s reign, setting the legal stage for Japan&#x27;s modernization. This also set up a process of urbanization as people of all classes were free to move jobs so people went to the city for better work. It remained influential, though less for governing than inspiring, throughout the Meiji era and into the twentieth century, and it can be considered the first constitution of modern Japan.

==Rules==
As the name implies, the text of the Oath consists of five clauses:

==Origin and subsequent influence==
The first draft of the Oath was written by junior councilor Yuri Kimimasa in January 1868, containing progressive language that spoke to the frustrations that the radical but modestly born Meiji leaders had experienced in &quot;service to hereditary incompetents.&quot; Yuri&#x27;s language was moderated by his colleague Fukuoka Takachika in February to be &quot;less alarming,&quot; and Kido Takayoshi prepared the final form of the Oath, employing &quot;language broad enough to embrace both readings.&quot; The Oath was read aloud by Sanjō Sanetomi in the main ceremonial hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace in the presence of the Emperor and more than 400 officials. After the reading, the nobles and &quot;daimyōs&quot; present signed their names to a document praising the Oath, and swearing to do their utmost to uphold and implement it. Those not able to attend the formal reading afterwards visited the palace to sign their names, bringing the total number of signatures to 767.

The purpose of the oath was both to issue a statement of policy to be followed by the post-Tokugawa shogunate government in the Meiji period, and to offer hope of inclusion in the next regime to pro-Tokugawa domains. This second motivation was especially important in the early stages of the Restoration as a means to keep domains from joining the Tokugawa remnant in the Boshin War. Later, military victory &quot;made it safe to begin to push court nobles and &quot;daimyō&quot; figureheads out of the way&quot;.

The promise of reform in the document initially went unfulfilled: in particular, a parliament with real power was not established until 1890, and the Meiji oligarchy from Satsuma, Chōshū, Tosa and Hizen retained political and military control well into the 20th century. In general, the Oath was purposely phrased in broad terms to minimize resistance from the &quot;daimyōs&quot; and to provide &quot;a promise of gradualism and equity&quot;:

The Oath was reiterated as the first article of the constitution promulgated in June 1868, and the subsequent articles of that constitution expand the policies outlined in the Oath. Almost eighty years later, in the wake of the Second World War, Emperor Shōwa paid homage to the Oath and reaffirmed it as the basis of &quot;national polity&quot; in his Imperial Rescript on National Revitalization. The ostensible purpose of the rescript was to appease the American occupiers with a renunciation of imperial divinity, but the emperor himself saw it as a statement of the existence of democracy during the Meiji era.

<text>Carrickfergus ( , meaning &quot;Fergus&#x27; rock&quot;) is a large town in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It sits on the north shore of Belfast Lough, from Belfast. The town had a population of 28,141 at the 2021 census. It is County Antrim&#x27;s oldest town and one of the oldest towns in Ireland as a whole. Carrickfergus Castle, built in the late 12th century at the behest of Anglo-Norman knight John de Courcy, was the capital of the Earldom of Ulster. After the earldom&#x27;s collapse, it remained the only English outpost in Ulster for the next four centuries. Carrickfergus was the administrative centre for Carrickfergus Borough Council, before this was amalgamated into the Mid and East Antrim District Council in 2015, and forms part of the Belfast Metropolitan Area. It is also a townland of 65 acres, a civil parish and a barony.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
The town is said to take its name from Fergus Mór (Fergus the Great), the legendary king of Dál Riata. According to one tale, his ship ran aground on a rock by the shore, which became known as &quot;Carraig Fhearghais&quot; – the rock of Fergus.

As an urban settlement, Carrickfergus far pre-dates the capital city Belfast and was for a lengthy period both larger and more prominent than the nearby city. Belfast Lough itself was known as &#x27;Carrickfergus Bay&#x27; well into the 17th century. Carrickfergus and the surrounding area was, for a time, treated as a separate county. The historical walled town originally occupied an area of around 97,000 square metres, which now comprises the town centre, bordered by Albert Road to the west, the Marine Highway to the south, Shaftesbury Park to the north and Joymount Presbyterian Church grounds to the east. Segments of the town wall are still visible in various parts of the town and in various states of preservation. Archaeological excavations close to the walls&#x27; foundations have yielded many artefacts that have helped historians piece together a picture of the lives of the 12th and 13th century inhabitants.

Carrickfergus became an inhabited town shortly after 1170, when Anglo-Norman knight John de Courcy invaded Ulster, established his headquarters in the area and built Carrickfergus Castle on the &quot;rock of Fergus&quot; in 1177. The castle, which is the most prominent landmark of Carrickfergus, is widely known as one of the best-preserved Norman castles in Ireland.

Sometime between 1203 and 1205, De Courcy was expelled from Ulster by Hugh de Lacy, as authorised by King John. De Lacy oversaw the final construction of the castle, which included the gatehouse, drum towers and outer ward. It was at this time that he established the nearby St Nicholas&#x27; Church. De Lacy was relieved of his command of the town in 1210, when King John himself arrived and placed the castle under royal authority. De Lacy eventually regained his title of Earl of Ulster in 1227, however the castle and its walled town were captured several more times following his death (in 1242). The forces of Edward de Bruce captured the town in 1315 and the castle in 1316 before his death in battle in 1318. The town was largely destroyed by the Scots in 1402.

===Early modern era===
The Battle of Carrickfergus, part of the Nine Years War, took place in and around the town in November 1597. It was fought between the crown forces of Queen Elizabeth I and the Scots clan of MacDonnell, and resulted in a defeat for the English. A contemporary Elizabethan illustration of Carrickfergus shows ten tower-houses, as well as terraces of single-storey houses, some detached cottages and 70 or more Irish beehive-type huts in the town.
Sir Arthur Chichester was appointed by the Earl of Essex to govern the castle and town in 1599 and was responsible for the plantation of English and Scottish peoples in the town, as well as the building of the town wall.
Nevertheless, the decaying castle withstood several days of siege by the forces of William of Orange in 1689, before surrendering on 28 August. William himself subsequently landed at Carrickfergus on 14 June 1690.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War, in February 1760, the whole town was briefly captured and held to ransom by French troops landed from Francois Thurot&#x27;s naval squadron, after the defenders ran out of ammunition. In 1711 Carrickfergus was the scene of the last witchcraft trial in Ireland. Eight women were charged with bewitching a young girl, and were convicted, despite a strong indication from one of the judges that the jury should acquit. They were sentenced to a year in prison and four sessions in the pillory.

In April 1778, during the American War of Independence, John Paul Jones, in command of the American ship &quot;Ranger&quot;, attempted to capture a British Royal Navy sloop of war, , moored at Carrickfergus. Having failed, he returned a few days later and challenged &quot;Drake&quot; to a fight out in the North Channel which the Americans won decisively.

During the 1790s there was considerable support in the Carrickfergus area for the United Irishmen. On 14 October 1797 William Orr was hanged in the town following what was widely regarded as a show trial held in Carrickfergus Courthouse (now the Town Hall) and in 1798 United Irish founder Henry Joy McCracken was captured on the outskirts of the town while trying to escape to America.

===Modern era===

In 1912 the people of Carrickfergus turned out in their thousands to watch as the made its first ever journey up the lough from its construction dock in Belfast. The famous passenger liner was anchored overnight just off the coast of Carrickfergus, before continuing on its journey.

During World War II, Northern Ireland was an important military base for United States Naval and Air Operations and a training ground for American G.I.s. The First Battalions of the elite US Rangers were activated and based in Sunnylands Camp for their initial training. The &quot;US Rangers Centre&quot; in nearby Boneybefore pays homage to this period in history. It is rumoured that Italian and German POWs were held in the town, the Italians in a camp at Sullatober mill, and Germans at Sunnylands.

In the 1970s, the town became an important centre for the textile industry. An ICI man-made fibres factory was opened at Kilroot and was followed by the Rothman&#x27;s cigarette factory. Courtaulds operated a large rayon works there until the 1980s.

In 1981, Kilroot power station opened and is the largest power station in Northern Ireland.

On 8 September 2007, Carrickfergus was the Northern Irish host for the &quot;Last Night at the Proms&quot;, featuring Alison Balsom, Alfie Boe, and Ulster conductor Kenneth Montgomery.

The British peerage title of Baron Carrickfergus, which had become extinct in 1883, was bestowed upon Prince William on his wedding day in 2011. He visited the town with Catherine, Princess of Wales in October 2022.

====The Troubles====
Throughout the course of The Troubles, there was a paramilitary presence in the town, namely the Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Defence Association. Census figures show that the Catholic population of Carrickfergus declined from 16.2% in 1971 to 9.56% in 2011.

==Carrickfergus in song and poetry==
The town is the subject of the classic Irish folk song &quot;Carrickfergus&quot;, a 19th-century translation of an Irish-language song (&quot;Do Bhí Bean Uasal&quot;) from Munster, which begins with the words, &quot;I wish I was in Carrickfergus&quot;.

Scottish Gaelic poet Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair&#x27;s &quot;immram&quot; poem &quot;Birlinn Chloinne Raghnaill&quot; (&quot;The Birlinn of Clanranald&quot;), describes the sea voyage of a Highland war galley from Loch Eynort, in South Uist, to Carrickfergus. Alan Riach, who has translated the poem into English, has praised the genius of its 18th-century author and how brilliantly he emulated both Homer and Virgil in telling his tale of men against the sea. Riach has also alleged that, in addition to being an immortal work of Scottish Gaelic literature, &quot;The Birlinn of Clanranald&quot;, is, &quot;one of the great poems of world literature.&quot;

<text>Ballycastle () is a small seaside town in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It is on the north-easternmost coastal tip of Ireland, in the Antrim Coast and Glens Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. 

Ballycastle lies at roughly the mid point of the Causeway Coastal Route and is a gateway to both the Glens of Antrim and the North Coast. With a number of attractions on the town&#x27;s doorstep such as the Giant&#x27;s Causeway, Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge and the Dark Hedges it is a popular destination and stopping point for tourists. The town also benefits from a sweeping bay and beach on its eastern side, with views to Fair Head and Knocklayde mountain dominating the landscape.

The town has been recognised on a number of occasions by The Sunday Times on their &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; list, and has been previously crowned the overall regional winner for Northern Ireland. 

The harbour hosts the ferry to Rathlin Island and a smaller passenger and charter service to Campbeltown and Port Ellen in Scotland, with both Rathlin Island and Scotland&#x27;s Kintyre peninsula able to be seen from the coast. The Ould Lammas Fair is held each year in Ballycastle on the last Monday and Tuesday of August. Ballycastle is the home of the Corrymeela Community.

Ballycastle had a population of 5,628 at the 2021 census. It was the seat and main settlement of the former Moyle District Council.

== Demographics ==
===2021 census===

*75.5% were from a Catholic and 18.3% were from a Protestant or other Christian background.

== History ==
Ballycastle can trace its history back to the founding of a settlement around Port Brittas, the old name for Ballycastle Bay. It is from here that it has been suggested that Fergus Mór mac Eirc, a purported king of Dalriada, sailed to Scotland and founded a large colony throughout Argyll.

From the late 14th century the area was at the centre of the territory controlled by the MacDonnell&#x27;s of Antrim. Descended from Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg, it was through the marriage of John Mór MacDonald and Margery Byset in 1399 that the clan laid the basis of their claim to the Glens of Antrim. However it wasn&#x27;t until the 16th century when the celebrated chieftain Sorley Boy MacDonnell of Dunaneeny Castle established the clan in both the Glens and The Route.

The settlement around Dunaneeny Castle, along with the settlements at Bonamargy Friary and the castle in the area of the Diamond merged to become the present day town. It is from this castle, that stood on the site of Holy Trinity Church, which the town derived its name. Ballycastle Castle which had been in the possession of the MacDonnell&#x27;s, before being seized by both Scottish and later Cromwellian troops, fell into disrepair with the last remaining walls being removed in the 19th century.

Around the year 1786 Hugh Boyd, the son of the rector of Ramoan parish church, obtained a lease and permission from parliament to build a new harbour and pier to protect shipping. He is known for establishing coal shafts, potteries, a glass factory and a number of industries which under his care saw Ballycastle become a flourishing town. Hugh Boyd is credited for the construction or establishment of a number of buildings that still stand in the town today.

== Governance ==
The town is located within The Glens district electoral area (DEA) of the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. In the 2019 Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council election, the residents of this DEA elected 2 Sinn Fein, 1 SDLP, 1 UUP and 1 Independent representatives to the council.

== Places of interest ==

The Ould Lammas Fair, historically a lamb sale, has now become a street get together with market stalls, busking and street performers, attracting upwards of sixty thousand people each year. The fair is normally held Bank holiday Monday and Tuesday at end of August based on the fact that fairs were always held on last Tuesday of the month. (When the bank holiday is the last day of August the fair occurs a week earlier.)

It is named after the Princess Taisie, the daughter of King Dorm of Rathlin Island. According to legend, Taisie, renowned for her great beauty, was betrothed to Congal, heir to the Kingdom of Ireland. The King of Norway also sought her hand in marriage, and when he arrived to claim his bride, her wedding celebrations to Congal had begun. The king and his army tried to capture Taisie, but in the subsequent battle he was killed, and his army fled leaderless and empty-handed.

* Overlooking the harbour, there is a monument to Guglielmo, 1st &quot;Marchese&quot; Marconi, whose employees made the world&#x27;s first commercial wireless telegraph transmission between Ballycastle and the East Lighthouse on Rathlin Island. Marconi was created a &quot;Marchese&quot; by King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy in 1929.
* Close to the beach, there is a sculpture of the Children of Lir. According to the legend, the children were cursed to spend 300 years on the Sea of Moyle, upon which Ballycastle is a coastal town.

== Buildings of note ==

It was built in Graeco-Italian style with an apse-shaped chancel, and an octagonal spire about high. It was effectively a chapel for the Boyd family and its estate for many years. The remains of many Boyd descendants are in the vaults below – although it was always subject to Episcopal jurisdiction. It was given to the Church of Ireland in about 1950. The church is open every day from 9am-5pm.
* Bonamargy Friary is off the Cushendall Road on the approach to Ballycastle and is a late Franciscan foundation established in 1485 by Rory MacQuillan. Locked vaults hold the remains of the celebrated chieftain, Sorley Boy MacDonnell, and several of the Earls of Antrim.
*Dunaneeny Castle is a ruined castle located on the cliffs overlooking Ballycastle Bay. Built by Alexander MacDonnell, the castle was also the birthplace of Sorley Boy MacDonnell.
* Kinbane Castle is on a headland projecting into the sea, about 3 miles (5 km) from Ballycastle on the road to Ballintoy. Originally a two-storey building, it was built in 1547 by Colla MacDonnell, who died within its walls in 1558.

<doc id="98019" wikidata="Q466390" url="?curid=98019" title="The Swan (1956 film)">
<text>The Swan is a 1956 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Charles Vidor from a screenplay by John Dighton. It is a remake of the 1925 silent film of the same name, itself based on the play of the same name by Ferenc Molnár.

The film stars Grace Kelly, Alec Guinness, and Louis Jourdan, with Agnes Moorehead, Jessie Royce Landis, Brian Aherne, Leo G. Carroll, Estelle Winwood, and Van Dyke Parks in supporting roles. The film was released the day Kelly became princess consort of Monaco.

==Plot==
In 1910, Princess Alexandra, the daughter of a minor branch of a European royal house, is urged by her mother to accept her cousin, Crown Prince Albert, as husband so that their family may regain a throne that was taken from them by Napoleon. Princess Alexandra tries to gain Albert&#x27;s attention; he is otherwise taken with sleeping late, shooting ducks and playing football with Alexandra&#x27;s two younger brothers. Alexandra&#x27;s mother urges her to show interest in the tutor, Dr. Nicholas Agi, to make Albert jealous and stimulate a proposal from him.

Agi is already taken with Alexandra and when she invites him to the farewell ball for the crown prince, he eagerly accepts. Later, when they are dancing at the ball, it appears that Albert is getting jealous, but instead he is more interested in playing the bass viol in the orchestra.

Later, Agi tells Alexandra how he feels about her. She tells him that it was all a ploy to get Albert to propose to her and she suspected he felt this way. She realizes that she has some feelings for him, but he refuses her. Albert comes to discover about this situation and is a little taken aback. Albert and Agi trade insults. Agi then storms out and tries to leave the next morning.

Alexandra, distraught over what happened, tries to leave with him, but he refuses her again. Albert&#x27;s mother, The Queen, shows up and is aghast upon hearing the entire story. Albert gives his blessing to the pair and says that when he becomes king, he will allow them back into the country. However, Agi ends up leaving the mansion without Alexandra.

Albert tries to console Alexandra by telling her she is like a swan: on the water she looks serene, but on land she is more like a goose. Albert then offers Alexandra his arm and they walk back into the mansion together.

==Cast==
==Background==
The 1925, 1930, and 1956 films are all based on the 1914 Hungarian play &quot;A Hattyú, Vígjáték Három Felvonásban&quot; (&quot;The Swan, A Comedy in Three Acts&quot;) by Ferenc Molnár.

Grace Kelly had previously appeared in the CBS Television production of &quot;The Swan&quot; on June 9, 1950.

MGM bought the screenrights in May 1955 as a vehicle for Kelly. Head of production Dore Schary also announced he intended to remake &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; with Kelly.

Kelly visited the Cannes Film Festival later that month. It was there she met Prince Rainier.

By August 1955, the lead roles had been given to Louis Jourdan – who had done a screen test in Paris – and Rex Harrison. However, Harrison was unable to come to terms with the studio. By the end of the month, Alec Guinness signed to play the role – it would be his first Hollywood movie.

Director Charles Vidor said the filmmakers paid close attention to the Princess Margaret–Peter Townsend romance. &quot;If they had wed we would have thought very seriously about changing our ending&quot;, he said. &quot;However, by not marrying a commoner made our &quot;Swan&quot; a new, modern story. Now they can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s old-fashioned.&quot;

==Production==
The film was shot on location in North Carolina, at the 1895 Biltmore Estate of George W. Vanderbilt in Asheville and at Lake Junaluska.

MGM held the release of &quot;The Swan&quot; to correspond with the civil wedding ceremony of Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier of Monaco, on April 18, 1956.

==Music==
The score was composed by Bronislau Kaper and conducted by Johnny Green, with orchestrations by Robert Franklyn. One piece of source music, &quot;Rakoczy March&quot;, an 1809 piece by John Bihari, was conducted by Miklós Rózsa.

MGM Records released two suites of portions of the music from the film on long-playing record after the release of the film. The complete score was released in 2004, on CD, on the Film Score Monthly label.

==Box office==
According to MGM records, the film earned $1,763,000 in the US and Canada and $1,986,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $798,000.

==Earlier film versions==
* The 1925 silent film with the same title was directed by Dimitri Buchowetzki and starred Frances Howard as Princess Alexandra, Adolphe Menjou as Crown Prince Albert and Ricardo Cortez as the tutor. That version ends with Alexandra and the tutor kissing, and the expectation they will marry.
* &quot;One Romantic Night&quot; (1930) starred Lillian Gish as Princess Alexandra and Rod La Rocque as Prince Albert, with Conrad Nagel as the tutor. It was directed by Paul Stein.

==Original Broadway production==
The original Broadway production of &quot;The Swan&quot; opened on Broadway in 1923, with Eva Le Gallienne as Princess Alexandra, Philip Merivale as Prince Albert, and Basil Rathbone as the tutor.

The highest point on the island is Slieveard, above sea level. Rathlin is from the Mull of Kintyre, the southern tip of Scotland&#x27;s Kintyre peninsula. It is part of the Causeway Coast and Glens council area, and is represented by the Rathlin Development &amp; Community Association.

=== Townland ===
Rathlin is part of the traditional barony of Cary (around the town of Ballycastle), and of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. The island constitutes a civil parish and is subdivided into 22 townlands:

==Demography==
===2021 Census===
Rathlin Island is labelled as The_Glens_B1 Data Zone according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency. As of the 2021 Census it is the smallest Data Zone. On Census day (21 March 2021) there were 141 people living in Rathlin Island. Of these:

* 57.5% (81) belong to or were brought up in the Catholic religion, 19.9% (28) belong to or were brought up in a &#x27;Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)&#x27; religion, 17.7% (25) had no religious background and 5.0% (7) came from other religious backgrounds.
* 38.3% had an Irish national identity, 39.0% had a Northern Irish national identity and 22.0% indicated that they had a British national identity (Respondents could select more than one nationality).
* 31.91% claim to have some knowledge of the Irish language, whilst 8.51% claim to be able to speak, read, write and understand spoken Irish. 4.26% claim to use Irish daily. 0.00% claim that Irish is their main language.
* 21.28% claim to have some knowledge of Ulster Scots, whilst 2.84% claim to be able to speak, read, write and understand spoken Ulster Scots. 2.13% claim to use Ulster Scots daily.

== Irish language ==
The Irish language (also known locally as Gaelic) was spoken on Rathlin Island for most of the last 2,500 years, prior to being gradually replaced within the community by English through a process of language shift that started in the 17th century. It is not known if the 1722 parish church of the established Church of Ireland preached locally in Gaelic, English or both, although the Church of Ireland had already translated the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer into Gaelic, which were used in Ireland and Scotland. Initially English was confined to trading with outsiders and amongst a small but growing number of newcomers during the 18th century, most islanders continued to speak Gaelic. Nevertheless knowledge and use of English increased and expanded on Rathlin until English eventually replaced Gaelic as the common community language probably some time in the middle of the 19th century. Gaelic persisted for a few decades as a family language amongst some islanders until they too switched to English. The last native Gaelic speakers on the island died in the 1950s and 1960s.

The local dialect shows many features typical for Scottish Gaelic and not found in other dialects of Ireland, e.g. forming plurals with &quot;-(e)an&quot; , use of the interrogative &quot;có&quot; (standard Irish &quot;cé&quot;), it uses the object pronouns &quot;e, i&quot; for subjects of finite verbs, etc., thus it is sometimes treated as a dialect of Scottish Gaelic rather than Irish. It was nevertheless mutually intelligible with dialects of the Irish mainland in the Glens of Antrim. The features shared with Irish dialects are typically retentions that were lost in Scotland between the 17th and 20th century rather than innovations common with Irish, e.g. retention of eclipsis of &quot;p, t, c, f&quot; (but not &quot;b, d, g&quot;) after some words ending in a consonant (eg. &quot;nar bpeacaidh&quot; &#x27;our sins&#x27;, &quot;nar bpiúr&quot; &#x27;our sister&#x27;, &quot;seacht bpont&quot; &#x27;seven pounds&#x27;).

== Transport ==
A ferry operated by Rathlin Island Ferry Ltd connects the main port of the island, Church Bay, with the mainland at Ballycastle, away. Two ferries operate on the route – the fast foot-passenger-only catamaran ferry &quot;Rathlin Express&quot; and a purpose-built larger ferry, commissioned in May 2017, &quot;Spirit of Rathlin&quot;, which carries both foot passengers and a small number of vehicles, weather permitting. Rathlin Island Ferry Ltd won a six-year contract for the service in 2008 providing it as a subsidised &quot;lifeline&quot; service. There is an ongoing investigation on how the transfer was handled between the Environment Minister and the new owners.

== Natural history ==
Rathlin is of prehistoric volcanic origin, having been created as part of the British Tertiary Volcanic Province.

The island was owned by Rev Robert Gage who was also the island&#x27;s rector. He had two daughters, Adelaide in 1832 and Dorothea in 1835. Adelaide was a botanist who wrote a book concerning the island&#x27;s flora and fauna. She visited Dorothea in Germany after she married his Serene Highness Albrecht, Prince of Warbeck and Pyrmonte. Adelaide was buried in Ramoan Churchyard in Ballycastle in 1920 and her book on Rathlin is now lost.

Rathlin is one of 43 Special Areas of Conservation in Northern Ireland. It is home to tens of thousands of seabirds, including common guillemots, kittiwakes, puffins and razorbills – about thirty bird families in total. It is visited by birdwatchers, with a Royal Society for the Protection of Birds nature reserve that has views of Rathlin&#x27;s bird colony. The RSPB has also successfully managed natural habitat to facilitate the return of the red-billed chough. Northern Ireland&#x27;s only breeding pair of choughs can be seen during the summer months.

The cliffs on this relatively bare island stand tall. Bruce&#x27;s Cave is named after Robert the Bruce, also known as Robert I of Scotland: it was here that he was said to have seen the legendary spider which is described as inspiring Bruce to continue his fight for Scottish independence. The island is also the northernmost point of the Antrim Coast and Glens Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

In 2008-09, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency of the United Kingdom and the Marine Institute Ireland undertook bathymetric survey work north of Antrim, updating Admiralty charts (Joint Irish Bathymetric Survey Project). In doing so a number of interesting submarine geological features were identified around Rathlin Island, including a submerged crater or lake on a plateau with clear evidence of water courses feeding it. This suggests the events leading to inundation – subsidence of land or rising water levels – were extremely quick.

Marine investigations in the area have also identified new species of sea anemone, rediscovered the fan mussel (the UK&#x27;s largest and rarest bivalve mollusc – thought to be found only in Plymouth Sound and a few sites off the west of Scotland) and a number of shipwreck sites, including HMS &quot;Drake&quot;, which was torpedoed and sank just off the island in 1917.

=== Algae ===
Species of algae recorded from Rathlin, such as &quot;Hypoglossum hypoglossoides&quot; , &quot;Apoglossum ruscifolium&quot; , &quot;Radicilingua thysanorhizans&quot; and &quot;Haraldiophyllum bonnemaisonii&quot; , were noted by Osborne Morton in 1994. Maps showing the distribution of algae all around the British Isles, including Rathlin Island, are to be found in Harvey and Guiry 2003.

=== Flowering plants ===
Details and notes of the flowering plants are to be found in Hackney.

== Archaeology ==

The island has been settled at least as far back as the Mesolithic period. A Neolithic stone axe factory featuring porcellanite stone is to be found in Brockley, a cluster of houses within the townland of Ballygill Middle. It is similar to a stone axe factory found at Tievebulliagh mountain on the nearby mainland coast. The products of these two axe factories, which cannot be reliably distinguished from each other, were traded across Ireland; these were the most important Irish stone axe sources of their time.

In 2006, an ancient burial was discovered when a driveway was being expanded by the island&#x27;s only pub, dating back to the early Bronze Age, ca. 2000 BC. Genomic analysis of DNA from the bodies showed a strong continuity with the genetics of the modern Irish population and established that the continuity of Irish population dates back at least 1000 years longer than had previously been understood.

There is also an unexcavated Viking vessel in a mound formation.

== History ==
Rathlin was probably known to the Romans, Pliny referring to &quot;Reginia&quot; and Ptolemy to &quot;Rhicina&quot; or &quot;Eggarikenna&quot;. In the 7th century, Adomnán mentions &quot;Rechru&quot; and &quot;Rechrea insula&quot;, which may also have been early names for Rathlin. The 11th century Irish version of the Historia Brittonum states that the Fir Bolg &quot;took possession of Man and of other islands besides – Arran, Islay and &#x27;Racha&#x27;&quot; – another possible early variant.

Rathlin was the site of the first Viking raid on Ireland, according to the Annals of Ulster. The pillaging of the island&#x27;s church and burning of its buildings took place in 795.

In 1306, Robert the Bruce sought refuge upon Rathlin, owned by the Irish Bissett family. He stayed in Rathlin Castle, originally belonging to their lordship the Glens of Antrim. The Bissetts were dispossessed of Rathlin by the English, who were in control of the Earldom of Ulster, for welcoming Bruce. In the 16th century, the island came into the possession of the MacDonnells of Antrim.

Rathlin has been the site of a number of massacres. On an expedition in 1557, Sir Henry Sidney devastated the island. In July 1575, the Earl of Essex sent Francis Drake and John Norreys to confront Scottish refugees on the island, and in the ensuing massacre, hundreds of men, women and children of Clan MacDonnell were killed. Also in 1642, Covenanter Campbell soldiers of the Argyll&#x27;s Foot were encouraged by their commanding officer Sir Duncan Campbell of Auchinbreck to kill the local Catholic MacDonalds, near relatives of their arch clan enemy in the Scottish Highlands Clan MacDonald. They threw scores of MacDonald women over cliffs to their deaths on rocks below. The number of victims of this massacre has been put as low as 100 and as high as 3,000.

On 2 October 1917, the armoured cruiser was torpedoed off the northern Irish coast by . She steamed into Church Bay on Rathlin Island, where, after her crew was taken off, she capsized and sank. On 27 January 1918, the RMS Andania was hit amidships by a torpedo from German submarine &quot;U-46&quot; captained by Leo Hillebrand. The ship immediately took a list to starboard and began to sink. Attempts were made to tow the ship but it sank after a few hours. The passengers were saved, but &quot;Andania&quot;&#x27;s sinking killed seven crew members. The wreck is lying at a depth of between 175 and 189 metres.

The island has been represented on the Islands Forum by the Rathlin Development and Community Association since 2022.

== Commerce ==

In 1746, the island was purchased by the Reverend John Gage. Rathlin was an important producer of kelp in the 18th century.

A 19th-century British visitor to the island found that they had an unusual form of government where they elected a judge who sat on a &quot;throne of turf&quot;. In fact, Robert Gage was the &quot;proprietor of the island&quot; until his death in 1891. Gage held a master&#x27;s degree from Trinity College, Dublin, but he spent his life on the island creating his book &quot;The Birds of Rathlin Island&quot;.

Tourism is now a commercial activity. The island had a population of over one thousand in the 19th century. Its current permanent population is around 125. This is swollen by visitors in the summer, with most coming to view the cliffs and their huge seabird populations. Many visitors come for the day, and the island has around 30 beds for overnight visitors. The Boathouse Visitors&#x27; Centre at Church Bay is open seven days a week from April to September, with minibus tours and bicycle hire also available. The island is also popular with scuba divers, who come to explore the many wrecked ships in the surrounding waters.

Richard Branson&#x27;s hot air balloon crashed near Rathlin Island in 1987.

On 29 January 2008, the RNLI Portrush lifeboat &quot;Katie Hannan&quot; grounded after a swell hit its stern on breakwater rocks just outside the harbour on Rathlin while trying to refloat an islander&#x27;s RIB. The lifeboat was declared beyond economical repair and handed over to a salvage company.

== Communications ==

The world&#x27;s first commercial wireless telegraphy link was established by employees of Guglielmo Marconi between East Lighthouse on Rathlin and Kenmara House in Ballycastle on 6 July 1898.

In July 2013, BT installed a high-speed wireless broadband pilot project to a number of premises, the first deployment of its kind anywhere in the UK, &#x27;wireless to the cabinet&#x27; (WTTC) to deliver 80 Mb/s to users.

== Notable people ==
* Catherine Gage (1815–1892), botanical and ornithological illustrator
* Kate Hoey (born 1946), member of the House of Lords and former Labour MP and minister, lives on the island
* Alexander Smyth (1765–1830), lawyer, soldier, and politician in Virginia

<text>Cookstown (, ) is a town in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It is the fourth-largest town in the county and had a population of 12,546 in the 2021 census. It, along with Magherafelt and Dungannon, is one of the main towns in the Mid-Ulster council area. It was founded around 1620 when the townlands in the area were leased by an English ecclesiastical lawyer, Dr. Alan Cooke, from the Archbishop of Armagh, who had been granted the lands after the Flight of the Earls during the Plantation of Ulster. It was one of the main centres of the linen industry west of the River Bann, and until 1956 the flax-related processes of spinning, weaving, bleaching and beetling were carried out in the town.

==History==
In 1609 land was leased to an English ecclesiastical lawyer, Dr Cooke, who fulfilled the covenants entered in the lease by building houses on the land. In 1628, King Charles I granted Letters Patent to Cooke permitting the holding of a twice-weekly market for livestock and flaxen goods.

In 1641, the native Irish revolted against the Planters in a bloody rebellion and the town was destroyed. The rebellion had a devastating effect on the town and development ceased for nearly a century. Over the succeeding years, the lands around Cookstown were progressively bought up by William Stewart of Killymoon until in 1671 all of Dr Cooke&#x27;s lands were in the hands of the Stewart family. William Stewart and later his son James set out plans for the town soon after this. Inspired by the Wide Streets Commission&#x27;s work in Dublin, they planned a new town to be built along a tree lined boulevard which was to be wide.

In 1802, Colonel William Stewart (James Stewart&#x27;s unmarried son) approached the London architect, John Nash, and requested that he visit the area to rebuild Killymoon Castle. Nash also designed the Rectory at Lissan for the Rev John Molesworth Staples in 1807.

With the establishment of Gunning&#x27;s Linen Weaving Mill, with over 300 looms, Cookstown developed in the 19th century as the local centre of the linen trade. Two railways established terminus railway stations at Cookstown - the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway (1856-1955) and the Great Northern Railway (1879-1959).

Prominent developments in the second half of the 19th century included J.J. McCarthy&#x27;s Church of the Holy Trinity on Chapel Street.

On 17 June 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) raided the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) barracks in Cookstown, with help from four sympathetic RIC officers. In a brief firefight, IRA member Patrick Loughran was killed. He was the first IRA man killed on active service in what became Northern Ireland.

Cookstown Town Hall was designed by the town surveyor, Charles Geoffrey Birtwell, and built on the Burn Road by James Corrigan of Pomeroy: it was officially opened on 27 May 1953.

During the Troubles, Cookstown suffered from several bomb attacks: on 2 November 1990 an off duty soldier from the Ulster Defence Regiment was killed by a car bomb.

Cookstown Town Hall was demolished in 1998 and the Burnavon Arts and Cultural Centre opened on the site in 2000.

==Places of interest==
*Ardboe High Cross and Abbey (&quot;&quot;), one of the best examples of a 9th/10th century High cross in Ireland, is from Cookstown. It forms the only remaining part of an early monastery on the site.

*Other ancient sites nearby include Beaghmore stone circles and Tullyhogue Fort (beside the village of Tullyhogue), the inauguration site of the chiefs of Tyrone (Tir Eogain), the O&#x27;Neills.

*The Donaghrisk walled cemetery to the southwest of (and clearly visible from) the fort is the resting place of the O&#x27;Hagans, the chief justices of Tyrone (and as such, they presided over the inauguration ceremonies of the O&#x27;Neills).

*Lissan House lies on the outskirts of Cookstown. It is a large structure which was the home of the Staples family for 350 years.

*Killymoon Castle is about south east of Cookstown. This structure is regarded as one of Cookstown&#x27;s finest pieces of architectural heritage. It was built in just over a year at a cost of £80,000 and was Nash&#x27;s first Irish commission.
*Drum Manor, approximately from the town. Alexander Richardson, a burgess from Edinburgh, Scotland, bought the estate of Craigbalk in 1617 and built Drum Manor, which was also known Manor Richardson. Alexander&#x27;s son Sir William Richardson left it to his second son, Alexander, from which the Richardsons of Drum descend. Sir William&#x27;s third son, William, who inherited lands near Augher, obtained a lease for lands in the townland of Tullyreavy on the Drum Manor estate, where he built a house by the lake known as Oaklands.
*St Luaran&#x27;s Church of Ireland church is on Church Street.
*James Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s Catholic church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, was constructed between 1855 and 1860 with a tower and spire at the east end. 
*Derryloran Old Cemetery is a historic site of interest, located on the Sandholes Road on the outskirts of the town, which features an old graveyard and churchyard dating back to the 17th Century.

<text>A high cross or standing cross (, , ) is a free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often richly decorated. There was a unique Early Medieval tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising large sculpted stone crosses, usually outdoors. These probably developed from earlier traditions using wood, perhaps with metalwork attachments, and earlier pagan Celtic memorial stones; the Pictish stones of Scotland may also have influenced the form. The earliest surviving examples seem to come from the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, which had been converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries; it remains unclear whether the form first developed in Ireland or Britain.

Their relief decoration is a mixture of religious figures and sections of decoration such as knotwork, interlace and in Britain vine-scrolls, all in the styles also found in insular art in other media such as illuminated manuscripts and metalwork. They were probably normally painted, perhaps over a modelled layer of plaster; with the loss of paint and the effects of weathering the reliefs, in particular scenes crowded with small figures, are often now rather indistinct and hard to read.

The earlier crosses were typically up to about two metres or eight feet high, but in Ireland examples up to three times higher appear later, retaining thick massive proportions, giving large surface areas for carving. The tallest of the Irish crosses is the so-called Tall Cross at Monasterboice, County Louth. It stands at seven metres or twenty-two feet high. Anglo-Saxon examples mostly remained slender in comparison, but could be large; except in earlier Northumbrian examples their decoration is mostly ornamental rather than figures. The crosses often, though not always, feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a Celtic cross; this seems to be an innovation of Celtic Christianity, perhaps at Iona. Although the earliest example of this form has been found on fifth-seventh century Coptic textile. The term &quot;high cross&quot; is mainly used in Ireland and Scotland, but the tradition across Britain and Ireland is essentially a single phenomenon, though there are certainly strong regional variations.

Some crosses were erected just outside churches and monasteries; others at sites that may have marked boundaries or crossroads, or preceded churches. Whether they were used as &quot;preaching crosses&quot; at early dates is unclear, and many crosses have been moved to their present locations. They do not seem to have been used as grave-markers in the early medieval period. In the 19th century Celtic Revival Celtic crosses, with decoration in a form of insular style, became very popular as gravestones and memorials, and are now found in many parts of the world. Unlike the Irish originals, the decoration usually does not include figures.

==Ireland and Britain==
High crosses are the primary surviving monumental works of Insular art, and the largest number in Britain survive from areas that remained under Celtic Christianity until relatively late. No examples, or traces, of the putative earlier forms in wood or with metal attachments have survived; the decorative repertoire of early crosses certainly borrows from that of metalwork, but the same is true of Insular illuminated manuscripts. Saint Adomnán, Abbot of Iona who died in 704, mentions similar free standing ringed wooden crosses, later replaced by stone versions. Perhaps the earliest surviving free-standing stone crosses are the Carndonagh stones in Carndonagh, Donegal, which appear to be erected by missionaries from Iona. fleeing the Viking raiders, &quot;giving Iona a critical role in the formation of ringed crosses&quot;. The round bosses seen on early crosses probably derive from Pictish stones. High crosses may exist from the 7th century in Northumbria, which then included much of south-east Scotland, and Ireland, though Irish dates are being moved later. However the dates assigned to most of the early crosses surviving in good condition, whether at Ruthwell and Bewcastle, the Western Ossory group in Ireland, Iona or the Kildalton Cross on Islay, have all shown a tendency to converge on the period around or slightly before 800, despite the differences between the Northumbrian and Celtic types. The high cross later spread to the rest of the British Isles, including the Celtic areas of Wales, Devon, Brittany and Cornwall, where ogham inscriptions also indicate an Irish presence, and some examples can be found on Continental Europe, particularly where the style was taken by Insular missionaries.

Most Irish High crosses have the distinctive shape of the ringed Celtic cross, and they are generally larger and more massive, and feature more figural decoration than those elsewhere. They have probably more often survived as well; most recorded crosses in Britain were destroyed or damaged by iconoclasm after the Reformation, and typically only sections of the shaft remain. The ring initially served to strengthen the head and the arms of the high cross, but it soon became a decorative feature as well.

The high crosses were status symbols, either for a monastery or for a sponsor or patron, and possibly preaching crosses, and may have had other functions. Some have inscriptions recording the donor who commissioned them, like Muiredach&#x27;s High Cross and the Bewcastle Cross. The earliest 8th- or 9th-century Irish crosses had only ornament, including interlace and round bosses, but from the 9th and 10th century, figurative images appear, sometimes just a figure of Christ crucified in the centre, but in the largest 10th century examples large numbers of figures over much of the surface. A fine example from this time period can be found on the shores of Lough Neagh in the Irish province of Ulster at Ardboe, County Tyrone. This cross stands around 18 feet tall and consists of 22 panels of biblical events. Some late Irish examples have fewer figures (often Christ accompanied by a local bishop or abbot), approaching life-size, and carved in very high relief. The Irish tradition largely died out after the 12th century, until the 19th-century Celtic Revival, when the Celtic cross form saw a lasting revival for gravestones and memorials, usually just using ornamental decoration and inscriptions. These are now found across the world, often in contexts without any specific link to the Insular Celts or Britain.
Anglo-Saxon crosses were typically more slender, and often nearly square in section, though when, as with the Ruthwell Cross and Bewcastle Cross, they were geographically close to areas of the Celtic Church, they seem to have been larger, perhaps to meet local expectations, and the two 9th century Mercian Sandbach Crosses are the largest up to that period from anywhere. The heads tend to be smaller and usually not Celtic crosses, although the majority of cross-heads have not survived at all. Carved figures in these large examples are much larger and carved in deeper relief than the Irish equivalents with similar dates – only some very late Irish crosses show equally large figures. Anglo-Saxon decoration often combines panels of vine-leaf scrolls with others of interlace, although the placement and effect from a distance is similar to Celtic examples. Smaller examples may have only had such decoration, and inscriptions, which are much more common on Anglo-Saxon than Irish crosses.

After the Viking invasions, the settled Norse population of the Danelaw adopted the form, and a number of crosses combine Christian imagery with pagan Norse myths, which the Church seems to have tolerated, and adopted at least as metaphors for the period when conversion was bedding down. The Gosforth Cross, a very rare almost-complete cross in England, is an example. By the 10th century such Anglo-Norse crosses were the bulk of the production in England, as the high cross seems to have been abandoned further south, although the simple and practical Dartmoor crosses, no doubt an essential aid to navigating Dartmoor, appear to have continued to be made for centuries after. Given the tough granite used, decoration is mostly slight and they are hard to date confidently. Market crosses, many once dating to the early medieval period, have continued to be erected and replaced until modern times.

In Pictish Scotland the cross-slab, a flat stone with a cross in relief or incised on an essentially rectangular stone, developed as a hybrid form of the Pictish stone and the high cross. The cross is normally only on one side of the stone and the remaining areas of the stone may be covered with interlace or other decoration. These are usually distinguished from true high crosses.

==Scandinavia==
The tradition of raising high crosses appeared at a time when Norse settlers appeared in the British Isles and met a Christian culture. A fragmentary cross has been discovered in Granhammar in Vintrosa parish in Närke, Sweden and testify to the English mission in the central Swedish provinces. The Swedish cross was very similar to a cross in Leek, Staffordshire, and may have been made by an English immigrant. In Norway the British tradition was more widely accepted and some 60 stone crosses are known from the country, but only four of them can be safely dated to the Viking Age thanks to runic inscriptions on the crosses. Many of the crosses have probably been raised on pagan grave fields when the family was baptised. Later, they were moved to cemeteries. The high cross tradition also probably helped increase the popularity of raising runestones (often with engraved crosses) in Sweden.

==Notable examples==

Amongst the most famous are:
* Muiredach&#x27;s Cross and West Cross at Monasterboice, County Louth
* The Clonmacnoise crosses: Cross of the Scriptures (the original 9th century cross is housed in a museum, but a copy stands on the original site), and the North and South Crosses.
* The Nether (or Lower) Cross, a 9th-century granite cross with ornate carving, in the graveyard of St. Canice&#x27;s Church, established by St. Canice, Finglas village, Dublin. The Cross was taken from its original location in the grounds of St. Canice&#x27;s Abbey and buried to prevent damage by Cromwellian forces in 1649. It was found 160 years later intact and moved to its present location.
* The Anglo-Saxon Ruthwell Cross from Scotland, 8th century, with relatively large figures.
* The Anglo-Saxon Bewcastle Cross Northumbrian
* The Anglo-Saxon Irton Cross, Cumbria showing affinity to the style of Bewcastle
* The Pictish/Early Medieval Dupplin Cross in Strathearn, Scotland
* The Pictish/Early Medieval Camus Cross in Angus, Scotland

* Classic examples of 9th-century Pictish cross-slabs: Aberlemno 2 and 3 at Aberlemno, Angus
* The 8th century Kildalton Cross from the Hebrides
* Iona Abbey has two crosses, with others on the island.
* Saint Tola&#x27;s High Cross. A 12th-century cross at Dysert O&#x27;Dea near O&#x27;Dea Castle showing Christ and a bishop carved in high relief on the east side, with geometric motifs and animal ornament on the other sides. On the west side of the base are shown the Temptation, with Adam and Eve beneath the tree of knowledge, while on the north side is some ceremony with several figures holding croziers. This is a particularly finely preserved twelfth-century example, that does not use the circle of the Celtic cross.
* The Ahenny High Crosses. The two sandstone Ahenny crosses date from the 8th to 9th centuries and are among the earliest of the ringed high crosses. Ahenny, County Tipperary, near the Kilkenny border, and the Monastic site of Kilclispeen, or the church of St. Crispen
* Ardboe High Cross, a 10th-century cross near Cookstown, eroded, showing 22 panels with scenes from the Old and New Testaments.
* St. Kevin&#x27;s Cross, Glendalough, a 12th-century cross, well preserved, made of granite.
* South Cross, Kells, County Meath, the best preserved of several 10th century crosses in the town.
* Doorty Cross, Kilfenora, County Clare; 12th century, has a bishop and two other clerics carved on it.
* Kilree High Cross, 9th century high cross said to be the burial place of Niall Caille, located 4 km southeast of Kells Priory, County Kilkenny.
* Kilkieran High Crosses, three crosses near Ahenny, County Tipperary: Plain Cross (unadorned), West Cross (with much ornamentation), Long Shaft Cross (has a long shaft with decoration).
* The two Moone High Crosses, in County Kildare near Moone. The large cross is believed to have been carved between 900 and 1000 AD. It is highly decorated and 5.33 m. high

==Modern period==
From the 19th century, many large modern versions have been erected for various functions, and smaller Celtic crosses have become popular for individual grave monuments, usually featuring only abstract ornament, usually interlace.

In 1887, the Rev. William Slater Calverley commissioned a replica life-sized copy of Gosforth cross and had it erected in the churchyard at Aspatria, Cumbria.[3]

In the early 21st century, Irish sculptor Brendan McGloin was commissioned by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Portland to handcraft a full size replica of the Clonmacnoise Cross of the Scriptures. The 13-foot, 5 tonne sandstone cross was completed in 2007 and shipped from Donegal to Portland, Oregon, where it will stand as a Famine memorial. In 2016, a high cross was erected outside Wakefield Cathedral, West Yorkshire, England, carved from stone quarried in Holmfirth and carved by Celia Kilner. This was based on the remains of a Saxon high cross, dated 930 A.D.

<text>The Monasterboice () ruins are the remains of an early Christian monastic settlement in County Louth in Ireland, north of Drogheda. The ruins are a national monument of Ireland and also give their name to the local village and to a civil parish of the same name.

==Name==
The name Monasterboice is a part-anglicisation of the Irish name meaning &quot;monastery of Buithe&quot;. It was formerly anglicised as &quot;Monasterboye&quot; and &quot;Monasterboyse&quot;. Boice is the English version of the Latin name Boecius, which was adopted as the equivalent of the Irish Buithe.

==History==
The monastic settlement was founded in the late 5th century by Saint Buithe (or Buite) who died around 521.

Poet and historian Flann Mainistrech, Flann of Monasterboice, was lector here.

Little is known about the monastery except for a list of abbots (759-1122). It fell into ruin after the establishment of the Cistercian Mellifont Abbey nearby in 1142.

A parochial church was in use at the location by the 13th century.

==Description==
The site includes the remains of two churches built in the 14th century or later and an earlier round tower, but it is most famous for its high crosses. The round tower is about 28 metres tall, and is in very good condition. It was likely built shortly after 968 and damaged in a fire in 1098. The three high crosses date from the 10th century and form part of the scriptural group (showing biblical scenes).

The 5.5-metre Muiredach&#x27;s High Cross is regarded as the finest high cross in the whole of Ireland. It is named after an abbot, Muiredach mac Domhnaill, who died in 923 and features biblical carvings of both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. The North and West crosses are also notable examples of this kind of structure, but these have suffered much more from the effects of the weather. A copy of the main cross is held in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

==Today==
The property is owned by the National Monuments Service and is accessible to the public.

Burials in the graveyard around the ruins continue in the present day.

<text>Diva (, ) is the Latin word for a goddess. Diva is a name from Roman mythology, and is associated with the nouns divus, diva, which means god, goddess, and the adjective divinius, which means divine or heavenly. It has often been used to refer to a celebrated woman of outstanding talent in the world of opera, theatre, cinema, fashion and popular music. If referring to an actress, the meaning of &quot;diva&quot; is closely related to that of &quot;prima donna&quot;. Diva can also refer to a person, especially one in show business, with a reputation for being temperamental or demanding.

==Derivation==
The word entered the English language in the late 19th century. It is derived from the Italian noun &quot;diva&quot;, a female deity. The plural of the word in English is &quot;divas&quot;; in Italian, &quot;dive&quot; . The basic sense of the term is &quot;goddess&quot;, the feminine of the Latin word &quot;divus&quot; (Italian &quot;divo&quot;), someone deified after death, or Latin &quot;deus&quot;, a god.

The male form &quot;&quot; exists in Italian and is usually reserved for the most prominent leading tenors, like Enrico Caruso and Beniamino Gigli. The Italian term &quot;divismo&quot; describes the star-making system in the film industry. In contemporary Italian, &quot;diva&quot; and &quot;divo&quot; simply denote much-admired celebrities, especially film actresses and actors, and can be translated as &quot;(film) star&quot;. The Italian actress Lyda Borelli is considered the first cinematic diva, following her breakthrough role in &quot;Love Everlasting&quot; (1913).

An extravagant admiration for divas is a common element of camp culture.

==Modern usage==
Women are often referred to as divas if they are &quot;difficult, temperamental and demanding&quot;. Welsh National Opera note that the title emerged in the early 19th century after an increase of female leading sopranos who &quot;almost became goddess-like in the eyes of their adoring public&quot;. They also note that the word has been used by the media to name many female politicians and entertainers rather than &quot;just ambitious and assertive like their male counterparts&quot;.

Many pop stars have been labelled as divas in the media, including Aretha Franklin, Ariana Grande, Beyoncé, Cher, Christina Aguilera, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, and Whitney Houston. Additionally, Madonna and Mariah Carey have been called an &quot;ultimate diva&quot; in the press and have often embraced the title as their media persona. Carey herself noted on a podcast with Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex that today&#x27;s media &quot;mean you&#x27;re a successful woman&quot; but also a &quot;bitch&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s not okay for you to be a boss&quot;. Musicologist Lily E. Hirsch argues that the phrase may be used in a sexist and racist manner when discussing a woman of color.

Multiple female artists and bands have also released albums and songs either titled or containing the word &quot;diva&quot;. These include Annie Lennox, En Vogue, Beyoncé and Sarah Brightman. English media personality and businesswoman Gemma Collins is well known for her &quot;diva persona&quot;. In 2018, she released a book titled &quot;The GC: How to Be a Diva&quot; and began starring in her own reality television series &quot;Gemma Collins: Diva&quot;.

In 1998, VH1 debuted its first annual &quot;VH1 Divas&quot; concert with Mariah Carey, Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion, Gloria Estefan and Shania Twain. Some other artists who performed at later concerts are Whitney Houston, Cher, Tina Turner, Diana Ross and Destiny&#x27;s Child. From April 1999, WWE used the term &quot;diva&quot; to refer to their female performers. In 2016 they discontinued this term becoming Women in WWE.

<text>David Mansfield (born September 13, 1956) is an American musician and composer.

Mansfield was raised in Leonia, New Jersey. His father, Newton Mansfield was a first violinist in the New York Philharmonic. David played guitar, pedal steel guitar and fiddle in his first band, called Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends, which also included two sons of Tony Bennett.

Bob Dylan asked Mansfield to tour with him on his 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue tour; he remained in Dylan&#x27;s band through their 1978 world tour.

After the Revue ended in 1976, Mansfield and two other members of Dylan&#x27;s band, T-Bone Burnett and Steven Soles, formed The Alpha Band. The band released three albums, &quot;The Alpha Band&quot; in 1977, &quot;Spark in the Dark&quot; in 1977, and &quot;The Statue Makers of Hollywood&quot; in 1978. While Mansfield in 1978 was working on the album, &quot;The Statue Makers of Hollywood&quot; with The Alpha Band, he appeared as a guitarist on &quot;Desire Wire&quot; by a struggling pop/rock artist Cindy Bullens that same year.

In 1986, Mansfield was an initial member of Bruce Hornsby and the Range, including playing the title instrument on the hit &quot;Mandolin Rain&quot;. However, he left the Range before their first tour.

Since The Alpha Band broke up, Mansfield has continued to work as a musician in sessions for Dylan, Burnett, Johnny Cash, Nanci Griffith, Roger McGuinn, Sam Phillips, Mark Heard, The Roches, Edie Brickell, Spinal Tap, Lucinda Williams, Dwight Yoakam, Victoria Williams, Loudon Wainwright III, Willie Nile, Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen and others.

Mansfield composed the music for the 1980 film &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; – he appeared in the movie, playing the fiddle on roller skates – and has since gone on to write scores for a number of other films, including others directed by &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s&quot; Michael Cimino. Mansfield cobbled together the soundtrack album for &quot;Songcatcher&quot;. He also composed the music for the soundtrack to &quot;The Ballad of Little Jo&quot; (1993), a movie written and directed by Maggie Greenwald, whom he married in 1994. Together they adopted two children. Maisie Mansfield-Greenwald (1997) and Lulu Mansfield-Greenwald (2000). He also composed the score with Van Dyke Parks for Walter Hill&#x27;s &quot;Broken Trail&quot; (2006), and they were nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special (Original Dramatic Score).

<text>Steven Soles is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, and guitarist.

Known also as J. Steven Soles, he was asked by Bob Dylan to join the band for his 1975–1976 &quot;Rolling Thunder Revue&quot; tour, he appeared on Dylan&#x27;s album &quot;Desire&quot; and he also played with Dylan on &quot;Street Legal&quot; and the following tour, including the live album &quot;Bob Dylan at Budokan&quot;. When that tour ended, Soles and two other members of Dylan&#x27;s band, T Bone Burnett and David Mansfield, formed The Alpha Band.

Like most of the musicians in The Rolling Thunder Revue, Soles appeared in the 1978 film, &quot;Renaldo and Clara&quot;, in which he played the rôle of Ramon.

During its time, The Alpha Band released three albums, &quot;The Alpha Band&quot; in 1977, &quot;Spark in the Dark&quot; in the same year and &quot;The Statue Makers of Hollywood&quot; in 1978.

After its breakup, T Bone Burnett went on to a distinguished production career, working with artists such as Roy Orbison, Lisa Marie Presley, John Mellencamp, Counting Crows, Elton John, Elvis Costello and k.d. lang. He won two Grammy Awards and an Academy Award.

Steven Soles released two solo albums of original material, &quot;The Promise&quot; in 1980, and 1982&#x27;s &quot;Walk By Love&quot;. Allmusic gave the first an album rating of three stars and the second four stars, commenting of &quot;Walk By Love&quot; that, &quot;more commercial than &quot;The Promise&quot;, this second solo album features catchier songs and fuller pop arrangements.&quot; Allmusic pointed out that the albums had both been critically acclaimed, &quot;if little heard&quot;.

Soles went on to produce or perform on albums by Dylan, Burnett, The Washington Squares, Bob Neuwirth, Steve Poltz, Peter Case, Elvis Costello, Roger McGuinn, Don McLean, The Monkees, The 77s, Olivia Newton-John, Roy Orbison, Tonio K, Victoria Williams, Steve Scott and others.

He was part of the highly acclaimed Cinemax special &quot;Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night&quot;. As J. Steven Soles, he is credited as &quot;Music Supervisor&quot; in the movie &quot;Space Truckers&quot; (Stuart Gordon, 1996).

Soles was married to actress P. J. Soles from 1973 to 1975.

<text>James Roger McGuinn (born James Joseph McGuinn III; July 13, 1942) is an American musician, best known for being the frontman and leader of the Byrds. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a member of the band. As a solo artist, he has released 10 albums and collaborated with, among others, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty and Chris Hillman. The Rickenbacker 12-string guitar is his signature instrument.

==Early life==
McGuinn was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, son of James Joseph McGuinn Jr (b. 1909) and Dorothy Irene (b. 1911), daughter of engineer Louis Heyn. His parents worked in journalism and public relations, and during his childhood, they had written a bestseller titled &quot;Parents Can&#x27;t Win&quot;. He attended the Latin School of Chicago. He became interested in music after hearing Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; (a song that he frequently covers as a part of his autobiographical live shows), and asked his parents to buy a guitar for him. Around the same time, he was also influenced by country artists and/or groups such as Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent and the Everly Brothers.

In 1957, he enrolled as a student at Chicago&#x27;s Old Town School of Folk Music, where he learned the five-string banjo and 12-string guitar. After graduation, McGuinn performed solo at various coffeehouses on the folk music circuit where he was hired as a sideman by the Limeliters, the Chad Mitchell Trio, and Judy Collins and other folk music artists in the same vein. In 1962, after he ended his association with the Chad Mitchell Trio, McGuinn was hired by Bobby Darin as a backup guitarist and harmony singer. Darin wanted to add a folk roots element to his repertoire because it was a burgeoning musical field. Darin opened T.M. Music in New York City&#x27;s Brill Building, hiring McGuinn as a songwriter for $35 a week. About a year and a half later, Darin became ill and retired from singing.

During 1963, just one year before he co-founded the Byrds in Los Angeles, McGuinn was working as a studio musician in New York, recording with Judy Collins and Simon &amp; Garfunkel. At the same time, he was hearing about the Beatles (whose first American appearances would come in February 1964) and wondering how Beatlemania might affect folk music. When McGuinn saw George Harrison play a 12-string Rickenbacker in the film &quot;A Hard Days Night&quot;, it inspired him to buy the same instrument.

By the time Doug Weston gave him a job at The Troubadour nightclub in Los Angeles, McGuinn had begun to include Beatles&#x27; songs in his act. He gave rock style treatments to traditional folk tunes and thereby caught the attention of another folkie Beatles fan, Gene Clark, who joined forces with McGuinn in July 1964. Together they formed the beginning of what was to become the Byrds.

==The Byrds==

During his time with the Byrds, McGuinn developed two innovative and very influential styles of electric guitar playing. The first was &quot;jingle-jangle&quot;, ringing arpeggios based on banjo finger picking styles he learned while at the Old Town School of Folk, which was influential in the folk rock genre. The second style was a merging of saxophonist John Coltrane&#x27;s free-jazz atonalities, which hinted at the droning of the sitar, a style of playing first heard on the Byrds&#x27; 1966 single &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; and influential in psychedelic rock.

While &quot;tracking&quot; the Byrds&#x27; first single, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, at Columbia studios, McGuinn discovered an important component of his style. &quot;The &#x27;Ric&#x27; 12-string Rickenbacker guitar] by itself is kind of thuddy,&quot; he noted. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t ring. But if you add a compressor, you get that long sustain. To be honest, I found this by accident. The engineer, Ray Gerhardt, would run compressors on everything to protect his precious equipment from loud rock and roll. He compressed the heck out of my 12-string, and it sounded so great we decided to use two tube compressors (likely Teletronix LA-2As) in series, and then go directly into the board. That&#x27;s how I got my &#x27;jingle-jangle&#x27; tone. It&#x27;s really squashed down, but it jumps out from the radio. With compression, I found I could hold a note for three or four seconds, and sound more like a wind instrument. Later, this led me to emulate John Coltrane&#x27;s saxophone on &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;. Without compression, I couldn&#x27;t have sustained the riff&#x27;s first note.&quot;

&quot;I practiced eight hours a day on that &#x27;Ric,&#x27;&quot; he continues, &quot;I really worked it. In those days, acoustic 12s had wide necks and thick strings that were spaced pretty far apart, so they were hard to play. But the Rick&#x27;s slim neck and low action let me explore jazz and blues scales up and down the fretboard, and incorporate more hammer-ons and pull-offs into my solos. I also translated some of my banjo picking techniques to the 12-string. By combining a flat pick with metal finger picks on my middle and ring fingers, I discovered I could instantly switch from fast single-note runs to banjo rolls and get the best of both worlds.&quot;

Another sound that McGuinn developed is made by playing a seven string guitar, featuring a doubled G-string (with the second string tuned an octave higher). The C. F. Martin guitar company released a guitar called the &quot;HD7 Roger McGuinn Signature Edition&quot; that claims to capture McGuinn&#x27;s &quot;jingle-jangle&quot; tone, which he created with 12-string guitars, while maintaining the ease of playing a 6-string guitar.
After &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; in 1965, &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot;, written by Pete Seeger with the lyrics drawn from Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament, was the Byrds&#x27; second Number One success in late 1965. In 1966, “Eight Miles High” peaked at no. 14 on the U.S. charts, achieving enduring classic status, even though the song was subject to a U.S. radio ban due to its alleged reference to recreational drug use. 1967 found the Byrds sliding still further in the charts, with “So You Want to Be a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star” which peaked at no. 29. “My Back Pages”, another Bob Dylan cover, was released later the same year and was to be their last top 40 hit. In 1969, McGuinn&#x27;s solo version of the &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot; appeared in the film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, while a full-band version was the title track for the album released later that year. McGuinn also performed a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Alright, Ma (I&#x27;m Only Bleeding)&quot; for the &quot;Easy Rider&quot; soundtrack. 1970&#x27;s &quot;Untitled&quot; album featured a 16-minute version of the Byrds&#x27; 1966 hit &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, with all four members taking extended solos representative of the &quot;jam-band&quot; style of playing popular during that period.

In 1968, McGuinn helped create the groundbreaking album &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;, to which many attribute the rise in popularity of country rock. McGuinn originally conceived the album as a blend of rock, jazz, folk and other styles, but Gram Parsons and Chris Hillman&#x27;s bluegrass-western-country influences came to the forefront.

==Post-Byrds==

After the break-up of the Byrds, McGuinn released several solo albums throughout the 1970s. In 1973 he collaborated with Bob Dylan on songs for the sound track of the Sam Peckinpah movie &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; including &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;. He toured with Bob Dylan in 1975 and 1976 as part of Dylan&#x27;s Rolling Thunder Revue, cancelling a planned tour of his own in order to participate. In late 1975, he played guitar on the track titled &quot;Ride the Water&quot; on Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;The 20th Anniversary of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; all-star album. In 1976, he released the album &quot;Cardiff Rose&quot; where he worked with Mick Ronson.

In 1977, he released an LP titled &quot;Thunderbyrd&quot;, which was also the name of his contemporaneous band. Other members included future John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers and Fleetwood Mac guitarist Rick Vito, future Poco bassist Charlie Harrison and drummer Greg Thomas.

In 1977, McGuinn joined fellow ex-Byrds Gene Clark and Chris Hillman to form McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman. The trio recorded an album with Capitol Records in 1979. They performed on many TV rock shows, including repeated performances on &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, where they played both new material and Byrds hits. McGuinn&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t You Write Her Off&quot; reached No. 33 in April 1979. While some believe that the slick production and disco rhythms didn&#x27;t flatter the group, it sold well enough to generate a follow-up. McGuinn, Clark and Hillman&#x27;s second release was to have been a full group effort entitled &quot;City&quot;, but Clark&#x27;s unreliability and drug problems resulted in the billing change on their next LP &quot;City&quot; to &quot;Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman, featuring Gene Clark&quot;.

Since 1981, McGuinn has regularly toured (primarily playing clubs and small theaters) as a solo singer-guitarist. In 2018 he embarked on a tour with Chris Hillman, a fellow original Byrd, backed by Marty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; album, after which McGuinn returned to touring solo.

In 1987, McGuinn was the opening act for Dylan and Tom Petty and he performed at Farm Aid.

In 1991 he took part in the Guitar Legends concerts in Seville, Spain as part of the Expo &#x27;92 Seville.

After a decade without a recording contract, he released his comeback solo album, &quot;Back from Rio i&quot;n 1991. It included the hit single &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, written together with, and featuring, Petty. He returned with a live band featuring John Jorgenson, George Hawkins and Stan Lynch.
In 1992 McGuinn performed at the 30th Anniversary Concert for Bob Dylan with George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Tom Petty, G.E.Smith, and others.
On July 11, 2000, McGuinn testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that downloading music from the Internet causes artists to not always receive the royalties that (non-Internet based) record companies state in contracts and that, to date, the Byrds had not received any royalties for their greatest successes, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and &quot;Turn, Turn, Turn&quot;; they only received advances, which were split five ways and were just &quot;a few thousand dollars&quot; per band member. He also stated that he was receiving 50 percent royalties from MP3.com.

He was also part of an author/musician band, Rock Bottom Remainders, a group of published writers doubling as musicians to raise proceeds for literacy charities. In July 2013, McGuinn co-authored an interactive ebook, &quot;Hard Listening&quot;, with the rest of the group.
===Folk Den===

Roger McGuinn has used the Internet to continue the folk music tradition since November 1995 by recording a different folk song each month on his Folk Den site. The songs are made available from his Web site, and a selection (with guest vocalists) was released on CD as &quot;Treasures from the Folk Den&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2002 for Best Traditional Folk Album. In November 2005, McGuinn released a four-CD box set containing one hundred of his favorite songs from the Folk Den.

==Personal life==

When McGuinn started with the Byrds, he used the name Jim, which he thought to be too plain. He became involved in the Subud spiritual association in 1965 and began to practice the latihan, an exercise in quieting the mind. He changed his name in 1967 upon advice from Subud&#x27;s founder Bapak. Telling McGuinn that it would better &quot;vibrate with the universe&quot;, Bapak sent the letter &quot;R&quot; to Jim and asked him to send back ten names starting with that letter. Owing to a fascination with airplanes, gadgets and science fiction, he sent names like &quot;Rocket&quot;, &quot;Retro&quot;, &quot;Ramjet&quot;, and &quot;Roger&quot;, the last a term used in signalling protocol over two-way radios, military and civil aviation. Roger was the only &quot;real&quot; name in the bunch, and Bapak chose it. McGuinn officially changed his middle name from Joseph to Roger and has used the name Roger professionally from that time on.

McGuinn married Susan Bedrick in 1963; however, the marriage was subsequently annulled. From December 1966 to November 1971, he was married to Dolores DeLeon. A fellow adherent of Subud, DeLeon changed her name to Ianthe in 1967 but reverted to her original name after the dissolution of their marriage. With DeLeon, McGuinn fathered two sons, filmmaker Patrick McGuinn and Henry McGuinn. Immediately following their divorce, McGuinn married a third time, to Linda Gilbert in November 1971; this marriage also ended in divorce in June 1975.

McGuinn left Subud in 1977, the same year that he met his fourth and current wife and business manager, Camilla; they married in April 1978. Since that time, the McGuinns have practiced evangelical Christianity.

A registered member of the Republican Party, McGuinn donated $2,000 to the Ben Carson presidential campaign in 2015 and refused to endorse Donald Trump, noting &quot;I don&#x27;t like Trump.&quot; He also opposed Florida Amendment 1 (2016) (an initiative pertaining to the solar energy industry, of which McGuinn is a longtime advocate) and endorsed Florida Amendment 2 (2016) (a medical marijuana legalization initiative).

<text>The name &quot;Tjorven&quot; is a fictional character created by Astrid Lindgren. It comes from a popular Swedish family show on television in the early 1960s. Based on a script by the Swedish author Astrid Lindgren, the story is about a number of characters living in the archipelago outside Stockholm. A central character is a plump and sunny little girl nicknamed Tjorven.

In the movies of Saltkråkan the character was portrayed by Swedish actress Maria Johansson.

In Stieg Larsson&#x27;s &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;, &#x27;Tjorven&#x27; appears also as the name for a cat character Mikael Blomkvist finds during his stay at a guest house.

Tjorven was also one of many nicknames for a woman who was accused of eating children in Romania.

<doc id="98043" wikidata="Q339031" url="?curid=98043" title="Van Dyke Parks">
<text>Van Dyke Parks (born January 3, 1943) is an American musician, songwriter, arranger, and record producer who has composed various film and television soundtracks. He is best known for his 1967 album &quot;Song Cycle&quot; and for his collaborations with Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys (particularly the album &quot;Smile&quot;). In addition to producing or arranging albums by Randy Newman, Harry Nilsson, Phil Ochs, Little Feat, Happy End, Ry Cooder and Joanna Newsom, Parks has worked with performers such as Syd Straw, Ringo Starr, U2, Grizzly Bear, Inara George, Kimbra, Suzy Williams, Bob Dylan and Silverchair.

Born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Parks spent his childhood studying clarinet, piano, and singing at the American Boychoir School in Princeton, New Jersey. He started his professional career as a child actor. During the 1950s, he worked steadily in movies and television, and in the early 1960s, he majored in music at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. After dropping out of university in 1963, he relocated to Los Angeles, where his first paid gig was arranging &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot; for the 1967 Disney film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. Following this, he involved himself with the growing West Coast music scene, subsequently playing with—or appearing on records by—acts like the Mothers of Invention, the Byrds, Judy Collins, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, and Harpers Bizarre. His LP &quot;Song Cycle&quot; mixed a number of genres (including bluegrass, ragtime, and show tunes) and framed classical styles in the context of 1960s pop music. It was released to underwhelming sales, but attracted a cult following in later years.

Starting in the 1970s, Parks made repeated excursions into Afro-Caribbean music, notably on his 1972 album &quot;Discover America&quot; and on records he produced for the Esso Trinidad Steel Band and Mighty Sparrow. At the same time, he managed the audio/visual department of Warner Bros. Records, which was the earliest of its kind to produce music videos for artists. Since then, he established himself in motion pictures and over the years has directed, arranged, produced, and composed soundtracks for theatrical films and television shows such as &quot;Popeye&quot; (1980), &quot;Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot; (1987). Much of his later work has been in commissioned orchestral arrangements for lesser-known indie acts.

==Early life==
Born in 1943 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, as the youngest of four children, Parks spent time in Lake Charles, Louisiana, during his childhood. His older brothers played brass instruments. His father, Richard Hill Parks, was a doctor who served as chief psychiatric officer in the Dachau liberation reprisals. Having studied with Karl Menninger, Richard&#x27;s specific medical specialties were neurology and psychiatry, and he was the first doctor to admit African-American patients to a white southern hospital. Richard was also a part-time clarinetist and had a dance band to get through medical school, Dick Parks and His White Swan Serenaders. Parks&#x27;s mother was a Hebraic scholar.

As Parks was growing up, there were two grand pianos in the family living room, and at age 4 he began studying the clarinet. He attended the American Boychoir School in Princeton, New Jersey, studying voice and piano, and would sing &quot;Gershwin, Schoenberg, atonal music, everything&quot;. Parks also was a street urchin in &quot;La bohème&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera and sang the title role in &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot; at New York City Opera. During his childhood, Parks became extremely fond of old-style American music, most notably the sounds of Tin Pan Alley. This interest in Depression-era songwriting correlated heavily with his artistic goals and interests during the 1960s and beyond. He was also deeply affected by musicians Spike Jones and Les Paul, which led him to develop an interest with studio experimentation in the form of pop music. Parks has said that the first record he ever purchased may have been Dean Martin&#x27;s &quot;Memories Are Made of This.&quot;

He began his professional career as a child actor. Between 1953 and 1958, he worked steadily in films and television, including the 1956 movie &quot;The Swan&quot;, starring Grace Kelly. He appeared as Ezio Pinza&#x27;s son Andrew Bonino on the NBC television show &quot;Bonino&quot;. One of his co-stars on &quot;Bonino&quot; was 14-year-old Chet Allen, who appeared as Jerry Bonino. Parks and Allen were roommates at the Boychoir School. Parks also had a recurring role as Little Tommy Manicotti (the kid from upstairs) on Jackie Gleason&#x27;s &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;.

After graduating from McKeesport High School, Parks majored in music at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he studied with Aaron Copland from 1960 to 1963, and developed an interest in Mexican music. In 1962, Parks began studying acoustic guitar. According to Parks, he learned 50 requinto solos of Mexican boleros but gave up the prospect when he realized playing guitar had become too commonplace.

==Music career==
===1960s===

Upon dropping out of Carnegie Tech in early 1963, Parks relocated to Los Angeles with the intent of being involved with the growing West Coast beatnik subculture and to play with his older brother Carson Parks as the Steeltown Two (later enlarged to three), which eventually became the folk group the Greenwood County Singers. The group included future RCA Records producer and recording artist Rick Jarrard. Parks later said of this decision, &quot;Going to California meant I escaped John Cage. I escaped the abstractions, the music you can&#x27;t remember, the highbrow angst.&quot; The two Parks brothers performed together at various coffeehouses around San Diego, Santa Barbara, and San Francisco. One of the people in attendance at a Santa Barbara performance turned out to be future Byrds member David Crosby, who at the time remarked to friend David Lindley, &quot;If they can get away with it, so can we.&quot; While in California, Parks attempted to land a job performing on the television show &quot;Art Linkletter&#x27;s House Party&quot; but was not accepted. Parks took a short hiatus from this group, briefly moving to New England to be part of the Brandywine Singers, earning up to $3,000 a week.

In 1963, his older brother Benjamin Parks, a French horn player, was killed in an auto accident in Frankfurt while working for the US State Department in Germany, one day before his 24th birthday. Terry Gilkyson informed Parks of the news and, to help make up for it, hired Parks as an arranger for his song &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot;, which was later featured in the Disney animated feature &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

Parks reacted strongly to Beatlemania. Of it, he claimed, &quot;I lived under a billboard that said &#x27;The Beatles is coming,&#x27; and I got the sense that it was a plague, and that it was going to have cultural implication throughout the world. ... It&#x27;s almost like the vestigial functions, the appendixes of the musical life that I had just begun to have a scant association with were being excised from the body of music with the advent of folk music gone electric. So I started to learn piano.&quot; He has repeatedly stated his annoyance with contemporary pop music during the mid-1960s and the culture&#x27;s increasing anglophilia, going so far as to say, &quot;apart from &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; I didn&#x27;t find anything striking coming out of the United States.&quot; However, he had a favorable opinion of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot;, and Parks has said to have been impressed with Dylan&#x27;s &quot;speaking-voice&quot; style. Accordingly, &quot;I also looked at his written lyrics and realized that he didn&#x27;t capitalize his letters. He was trying to copy e.e. cummings and, while it was transparently imitative, I thought it was a good position.&quot;

By 1964, Parks was growing more and more interested in songwriting. Parks has said that while bass player Hal Brown of the Brandywine Singers took him sightseeing around a decrepit &quot;almost-ghost town&quot;, the two had a chance encounter with the San Francisco group the Charlatans in an old saloon. The group derided the 21-year-old Parks for his &quot;preppy&quot; and &quot;square&quot; appearance, and Parks responded by showing off a song he had recently written named &quot;High Coin&quot;, which impressed the group so much that they asked if they could record it. Parks agreed, and the Charlatans&#x27; version of &quot;High Coin&quot; received much airplay in San Francisco, which established Parks within the hippie counterculture. Soon after, Parks quit the Brandywine Singers and signed an artist contract with MGM Records, for which he recorded the singles &quot;Number Nine&quot; (based on &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;) and &quot;Come to the Sunshine&quot;, which did not succeed commercially. They were both produced by Tom Wilson. Two years later, Parks&#x27;s compositions written for other artists were becoming known for their lyrical wordplay and sharp imagery. Producers Lenny Waronker and Terry Melcher were reportedly obsessed with the song &quot;High Coin&quot; in particular, and Waronker contacted Parks to persuade him to switch to Warner Bros. Records. The two then turned their attention to a relatively unknown group, the Tikis, and transformed them into the novelty act Harpers Bizarre, which became a success for the label. Harpers Bizarre performed a few of Parks&#x27; compositions on their albums, and Parks himself appears on the recordings alongside other uncredited musician friends. During this period, Parks worked frequently as a session musician, arranger, and songwriter and became acquainted with future close friends Randy Newman, Harry Nilsson, and Beach Boys bandleader Brian Wilson. Parks also performed on the Byrds&#x27; album &quot;Fifth Dimension&quot; and declined an offer by David Crosby to join the band.

In 1965, Parks briefly joined Frank Zappa&#x27;s Mothers of Invention on stage, where he was referred to as &quot;Pinocchio.&quot; Asked why he left, Parks said, &quot;because I didn&#x27;t want to be screamed at&quot;, although he attended sessions for the Mothers&#x27; 1966 album &quot;Freak Out!&quot;. At some point, he performed at least one solo date with guitarists Steve Young and Stephen Stills as the opening act for the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful. They performed as &quot;The Van Dyke Parks.&quot; Parks soon wrote a song for Young entitled &quot;The All Golden.&quot; He was also later asked to join Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young but declined.

====Meeting Brian Wilson====
Parks initially became aware of the Beach Boys during their early popularity in the early 1960s. Speaking of them in 1995, he said, &quot;I knew they didn&#x27;t surf.…I felt some resentment about [them], and I had been a fan of &quot;Four Freshmen and 5 Trombones&quot;.…Instinctively, I was not a Beach Boy fan. &#x27;Something really dumb about it.&#x27;&quot; He added that, &quot;I loved &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, you see. I came back to love them, and thought they had done a great job. It seemed to me that they would be fine in fighting spirit to take on this challenge of wresting that trophy out of the hands of those interlopers.&quot; Parks went on to call Wilson &quot;the biggest event of that era&quot; but was hesitant to label him a &quot;genius&quot;, believing Wilson to be more &quot;a lucky guy with a tremendous amount of talent and a lot of people collaborating beautifully around him.&quot;

According to most accounts, in 1966, Parks was introduced to Wilson while attending a party held at Terry Melcher&#x27;s home. Wilson biographer Peter Ames Carlin dates their meeting to mid-July, whereas music historian Keith Badman cites February. However, Parks had already met Wilson at least once before, in December 1965, when David Crosby, a mutual friend, invited him to Wilson&#x27;s home in Beverly Hills.

Wilson&#x27;s (since-discredited) 1991 memoir, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice: My Own Story&quot;, suggested that he had met Parks, or had heard of him, through an unnamed mutual friend in December 1964. Author David McGowan suggests that the friend may have been Loren Schwartz, who had supervised Wilson&#x27;s first LSD trip. According to Parks, Wilson &quot;sought me out&quot; after he had heard about him through mutual friends, &quot;a neighborly couple&quot; that experimented with psychedelic drugs. &quot;People who experimented with psychedelics—no matter who they were—were viewed as &#x27;enlightened people,&#x27; and Brian sought out the enlightened people.&quot;

In Wilson&#x27;s 1991 memoir, it was written that his first impressions of Parks was &quot;a skinny kid with a unique perspective&quot; and that he &quot;had a fondness for amphetamines&quot; at the time. Parks hesitantly confirmed this, but added, &quot;Those were &quot;his&quot; amphetamines. They were in &quot;his&quot; medicine cabinet. I&#x27;d never had amphetamines. I was working for Brian Wilson at 3:30 AM when he wanted to have his amphetamines.&quot; It was also Parks who introduced Wilson to Beatles publicist Derek Taylor, who later became the Beach Boys&#x27; publicist for some time during the 1960s.

====&quot;Smile&quot; and collapse====

Unsatisfied with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; collaborator Tony Asher&#x27;s lyrics for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, Wilson first asked Parks to help him rewrite the lyrics to the song; Parks declined, stating that he didn&#x27;t think he could improve on them. During the recording of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; in 1966, Parks claims to have suggested to Wilson while attending a session to have the cellist play triplet notes. Impressed by the results, Brian Wilson soon convinced Parks to write lyrics for the Beach Boys&#x27; next LP, the ambitious but ill-fated &quot;Smile&quot;. In preparation for the writing and recording of the album, Wilson purchased several thousand dollars&#x27; worth of marijuana and hashish for himself and his friends, including Parks.

In light of Wilson&#x27;s increasingly fragile mental state, the group tensions, and his signing to Warner Bros., Parks&#x27;s involvement in &quot;Smile&quot; effectively ceased after early 1967, when he left to begin work on his solo career. Giving his reasons, he said, &quot;I walked away from the situation as soon as I realized that I was causing friction between him and his other group members, and I didn&#x27;t want to be the person to do that. I thought that was Brian&#x27;s responsibility to bring definition to his own life. I stepped in, perhaps, I &#x27;took a leap before I looked&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know, but that&#x27;s the way I feel about it.…As soon as I found out I was entering an eat or be eaten situation... I was raised differently. I didn&#x27;t want to be part of that game.&quot; Recording sessions ground to a halt soon after, as Wilson became increasingly withdrawn, and the album was shelved a few months later.

====&quot;Song Cycle&quot; and aftermath====
Sometime in the mid-1960s, Parks visited Frank Sinatra while working at Warner Bros. Sinatra was dispirited by the rise of rock, and was considering retirement. To help alleviate this, Parks pitched his brother Carson&#x27;s song &quot;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&quot; as a duet for Sinatra and his daughter Nancy. Purportedly on Lee Hazlewood&#x27;s advice, Sinatra recorded &quot;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&quot;, and it became his first million-selling single. This bought credit for Parks at Warner Bros, and they proceeded to fund Parks&#x27;s one single: a cover of Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Colours&quot;, from his 1965 album &quot;Fairytale&quot;. It was credited to &quot;George Washington Brown&quot;—a fictitious pianist from South America—purportedly to protect his family from the potential infamy of his &quot;musical criminology&quot;. &quot;Donovan&#x27;s Colours&quot; received an ecstatic two-page review by Richard Goldstein, which convinced the label of Parks&#x27;s ability.
In 1967, Parks completed his first solo album, &quot;Song Cycle&quot;, produced by Lenny Waronker. Besides original compositions by Parks, &quot;Song Cycle&quot; includes interpretations of Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;Vine Street&quot;, Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Colours&quot;, and the traditional &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot;. The album&#x27;s production reportedly cost more than US$35,000 (equal to US$ today), making it one of the most expensive pop albums ever recorded up to that time. It sold very poorly despite rave critical reviews but gained status as a cult album in later years. Shortly after &quot;Song Cycle&quot;, Parks released a standalone 7&quot; single: the A-side &quot;The Eagle and Me&quot; backed with &quot;On The Rolling Sea When Jesus Speak To Me&quot;, which also sold poorly.

Parks has been critical of the flower power movement, which occurred toward the end of the decade, saying &quot;Rock became a corporate classification, just like the blues. They took off its sexual organs. Some people got paid a lot of money to bottle the rebellion of the &#x27;60s, and that&#x27;s when it started to mean zero to me.&quot; He added, &quot;To me, 1969 really suggested the death knell of the counter-culture revolution. The terrible event of Charles Manson showed the cultism of the period; I was always wary of crowds. I didn&#x27;t go to Woodstock. I didn&#x27;t want to be in a mudflat waiting to get into a portable toilet. I thought it was a terrible idea. So I stayed at my office at Warner Bros.…I don&#x27;t even know what happened around then, for many reasons. One is I was working so hard and was too busy to really get totally turned around by what other people were doing.&quot;

The aftermath of his work on &quot;Smile&quot; and &quot;Song Cycle&quot; left Parks wanting to focus more behind-the-scenes and with lesser-known artists, such as Randy Newman and Ry Cooder, and expressed discontent with being &quot;typecast&quot; by his songs. The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill was also life-altering for Parks and changed his &quot;very reason for being&quot;. Sometime after, he met the Esso Trinidad Steel Band, a Trinidadian calypso band who had been performing with Liberace in Las Vegas. According to Parks, &quot;I saw them as enslaved in their relationship to Liberace; I thought it was a vulgarity. I wanted to save them from their trivialization.&quot; What had begun as Parks&#x27;s desire to popularize calypso at that point became his focal point, and he worked with the steel band for the next several years. Speaking about his life then, Parks stated, &quot;My favorite group was the Esso Trinidad Steel Band, whom I worked with. I loved calypso all my life. I knew every Trinidadian in Hermosa Beach back then, there were probably about 20 families. Now there&#x27;s a huge population.&quot;

During the late 1960s, Parks became one of the first owners of a prototype Moog synthesizer and recorded a number of experimental advertising jingles for various companies such as Datsun and the Ice Capades. Parks plays the Moog on the Biff Rose song &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Great Day&quot;, from Rose&#x27;s second LP, &quot;Children of Light&quot;. Parks was also instrumental in the genesis of the 1970 album &quot;In a Wild Sanctuary&quot;, by the electronic outfit Beaver &amp; Krause. While having lunch with the duo, Parks suggested that they record an ecological concept album through the use of field recordings and synthesizers. Parks and Randy Newman helped the duo get signed to the Warner Bros. label.

===1970s===

In 1972, Parks&#x27;s travels to the West Indies inspired his second solo album, &quot;Discover America&quot;, a tribute to the islands of Trinidad and Tobago and to calypso music. Parks re-arranged and re-produced obscure songs and calypso classics. Parks also produced the album &quot;Esso&quot; for the Esso Trinidad Steel Band in 1971. It was cultivated as a tribute to Prince Bernhard, the head of the World Wildlife Fund at the time. According to Parks, &quot;Everything was directed to making it a proper, political, green album.&quot; This direction was continued in the 1975 release &quot;Clang of the Yankee Reaper&quot;.

In the early 1970s, Parks was brought in to produce the third album by seminal Japanese folk rock band Happy End while working on &quot;Discover America&quot; at Sunset Sound Recorders. He also helped with the writing for the closing track, . Sometime after, Parks became acquainted with member Haruomi Hosono, who went on to be one of the founding members of the electronic band Yellow Magic Orchestra. Parks went on to participate in a number of Hosono-related projects.

Although &quot;Smile&quot; had dissolved in mid-1967, Parks&#x27;s collaborations with Wilson had not, for the time being. He was instrumental in getting the Beach Boys signed to Reprise and contributed vocally to &quot;A Day in the Life of a Tree&quot; and the writing of &quot;Sail On, Sailor.&quot; Several songs with his lyrics, written during the &quot;Smile&quot; sessions, appeared on later Beach Boys albums, including &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up,&quot; &quot;Heroes and Villains,&quot; and &quot;Cabinessence.&#x27;

In September 1970, Parks became head of the audio/visual department of Warner Bros. records. This department was the earliest of its kind to record videos to promote records. Parks made the department up by himself and had few employees at Warner Bros. Together they made more than a dozen promotional films documenting artists including Ry Cooder, Joni Mitchell, Randy Newman, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, and Captain Beefheart. They were by nature documentary films, which could be rented or bought by any accredited music school. Parks later described the department as &quot;promotional—but they could create an income stream for musicians who were hard-pushed into tours that required drugs to sustain them.&quot; Although each production ran for about ten minutes and required at least $18,500 to create, one exception was a video for the Esso Trinidad Steel Band, which ran about forty minutes. It also happens to be one of two films known by Parks to have survived since then, the other being a promotional video for Ry Cooder.

Parks recorded only two albums during the 1970s, but he had performed on numerous albums recorded by friends who were working in or around the Los Angeles music scene—notably Harry Nilsson, whom Parks considered the &quot;smartest guy&quot; he had ever met in the music business. During the early 1970s, Parks dealt with prescription drug abuse. He later spoke of himself as being &quot;dead for five years&quot;, and he spent the first half of the decade &quot;trying to regain an interest in living.&quot; Parks later stated, &quot;When I was head of audio-visual services and on the A&amp;R staff at Warner Bros., a man came into my office and he had a snake and his name was Alice. Right then, I knew that my days were numbered as a person really interested in the record business.&quot; About his department during this time Parks stated, &quot;I provided that each artist would get 25% of the net profits of the rentals or sales. It was going to be a very promising market for the artist. Warners soon grew tired of what I thought was a fair equation of participation in creative profits, and basically isolated me.&quot;

After &quot;Clang of the Yankee Reaper&quot;, Parks quit his day job at Warner Bros. and &quot;retreated from further record interests, seeking the more gregarious plain-speaking of the film community…with no less satisfaction.&quot; He spent the next several years, and most of the 1980s, focusing more on motion picture and television projects, writing scores for high-profile films, such as &quot;Popeye&quot;, and serving as musical director for television programs such as &quot;The Billy Crystal Comedy Hour&quot;, taking on as much work as he could to stay out of unemployment.

===1980s===

Parks made a slight comeback in 1984 with the album &quot;Jump!&quot;, which featured songs adapted from the stories of Uncle Remus and Br&#x27;er Rabbit. The album exhibits a Broadway-style reduced orchestra with Americana additions, such as banjo, mandolin, and steel drums. Parks composed the album but did not arrange or produce it. Martin Kibbee contributed to the lyrics. Following up on the album, Parks wrote a series of children&#x27;s books—&quot;Jump&quot; (with Malcolm Jones), &quot;Jump Again&quot;, and &quot;Jump On Over&quot;—based on the Br&#x27;er Rabbit tales, illustrated by Barry Moser, and loosely accompanied by Parks&#x27;s own album &quot;Jump!&quot;. The books contain sheet music for selected songs from the album. Parks also published a book called &quot;Fisherman &amp; His Wife&quot; in 1991, which came packaged with a cassette.

By 1984, Parks was refused future collaborations with Wilson, instead being informed by an unnamed representative that &quot;Mike Love is Brian Wilson&#x27;s exclusive collaborator.&quot; Though Parks worked with the other Beach Boys on songs such as on &quot;Kokomo&quot; and the album &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot;, he did not work together with Wilson until a few years later, during the aborted album &quot;Sweet Insanity&quot;.

He wrote &quot;City of Light&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a B-Movie&quot;, &quot;Cutting Edge&quot;, and &quot;Worthless&quot;, all of which were used in the film &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot;, directed by Jerry Rees. During the 1980s and 1990s, Parks grew considerably more active in arranging and producing albums by independent artists, which inspired him to return more fully to the music business.

Following &quot;Jump!&quot;, in 1989 Warner Brothers released &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot;. This concept album focuses on the history of Japanese-U.S. relations from the 19th century to the &quot;trade war&quot; at the time of its release. The songs are pop tunes with an orchestral treatment including Japanese instruments and old Parks Caribbean favorites like steel drums. The album did not sell well and was not widely noticed by critics. To promote the album, he performed some shows in Japan with musicians such as Haruomi Hosono, Syd Straw, harmonicist Tommy Morgan, and steelpan player Yann Tomita.

===1990s===

Between 1992 and 1995, Parks teamed up again with a then-reclusive Brian Wilson to create the album &quot;Orange Crate Art&quot;. Parks wrote all of the songs on the album, except &quot;This Town Goes Down at Sunset&quot; and George Gershwin&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Lullaby&quot;, with vocals by Wilson. &quot;Orange Crate Art&quot; is a tribute to the Southern California of the early 1900s and a lyrical tribute to the beauty of Northern California. It was recorded during a stressful period for Wilson, after being involved in court orders relating to years of psychiatric misconduct to which he had been subject. According to Parks, &quot;When I found him, he was alone in a room staring at a television. It was off.&quot; The album was met with poor commercial reception, much to the disappointment of Parks.

1998 saw the release of Parks&#x27;s first live album, &quot;&quot;, which shows a love of the work of 19th-century American pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk, as well as performances of several of Parks&#x27; better-known and lesser-known songs. The live ensemble includes Sid Page as concertmaster.

===2000s===
Parks&#x27;s association with Australian rock band Silverchair began with his work on their fourth studio album &quot;Diorama&quot; in 2002. Parks was attracted to the music of lead singer and guitarist Daniel Johns and has stated that what most attracted him to the band was Johns&#x27; courage. He composed orchestral arrangements for Silverchair&#x27;s fifth album &quot;Young Modern&quot; album in 2007. Johns traveled to Prague with Parks to have the arrangements recorded by the Czech Philharmonic. The album&#x27;s title is a nickname Parks uses for Johns.

Parks was contacted by Wilson in 2003 to help with preparing a live performance of &quot;Smile&quot;. He agreed, and the duo re-recorded the album and then presented it on a world tour, beginning with the world premiere performance at the Royal Festival Hall in London, which Parks attended. Parks later provided some lyrics to &quot;That Lucky Old Sun&quot;, released in 2008. The album once again featured almost completely new compositions written by Brian Wilson, but with minimum input from Parks compared to the previous &quot;Smile&quot; collaboration.

Parks worked with Inara George on a record released in 2008, &quot;An Invitation&quot;, and they performed two songs together on January 8, 2008, at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, as part of the program &quot;Concrete Frequency: Songs of the City&quot;.

In 2009, Parks performed in &quot;The People Speak&quot;, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;. Parks performed with Bob Dylan and Ry Cooder on the documentary broadcast on December 13, 2009, on the History Channel. They played &quot;Do Re Mi&quot; and reportedly a couple of other Guthrie songs that were excluded from the final edit.

===2010s===

In 2010, Parks stated &quot;At this point, I don&#x27;t have an album in me. But I have some songs, so I&#x27;m putting them out as 45 rpm stereo records this summer.&quot; Between 2011 and 2012, Parks issued six double-sided singles, which featured new original songs, collaborations, unreleased archival recordings, re-recordings of older tracks, and covers. The singles also featured guest spots from singers Gaby Moreno and Inara George of The Bird and the Bee. Parks has also stressed the importance of the singles&#x27; artwork, contributed by visual artists such as Klaus Voormann, Ed Ruscha, and Art Spiegelman. Artist Charles Ray also sculpted two life-size statues of Parks.

In August 2011, Parks was contacted by electronic musician Skrillex, who requested that he supply orchestral arrangements. His arranging work was released in December 2011 as the iTunes-exclusive bonus track &quot;Skrillex Orchestral Suite by Varien&quot; on the &quot;Bangarang&quot; EP. Parks admitted in 2013:

In November 2011, after 44 years, a compilation box set of the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Smile&quot; sessions was finally released by Capitol Records. Parks was personally absent from &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot;&#x27; advertising campaign and liner notes, and refused to comment on the box set, despite initially giving his approval. In promotional interviews for &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot; and the Beach Boys&#x27; 50th Reunion Tour, Mike Love suggested that &quot;Smile&quot; collapsed due to substance abuse, and that the project was heavily influenced by Parks&#x27; drug use. One interview included an off-the-cuff comment by Brian Wilson saying that it was Parks who introduced him to LSD and amphetamines, something Parks has previously denied. Later in 2011, Parks formally responded to these claims via his web site in a post that accused Love of Mammon and historical revisionism. In February 2013, &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot; went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Historical Album.

While in Tokyo in January 2013, Parks performed with Haruomi Hosono for the first time in years. In March 2013, Parks announced the release of &quot;Songs Cycled&quot;, which compiled his six 2011–12 singles into one LP. It was Parks&#x27; first full album of relatively new material since 1995&#x27;s &quot;Orange Crate Art&quot;. The album was released on May 6, 2013 through Bella Union. Also in March, Parks performed at the 2013 Adelaide Festival with Daniel Johns and Kimbra. In September 2013, Parks curated a &quot;Best-of&quot; CD by New Orleans pianist/composer Tom McDermott entitled &quot;Bamboula&quot;. Parks memorialized the 50th anniversary of the 1963 Kennedy assassination by releasing a new original composition entitled &quot;I&#x27;m History&quot; on November 22.

Parks underwent unsuccessful hand surgery in 2014, causing his hands to freeze after about forty minutes of playing piano. On May 9, 2015, Parks performed what he called his &quot;final piano performance&quot; at the Largo in Los Angeles. Guest performers included singer Gaby Moreno; songwriter-producer Joe Henry; Grizzly Bear&#x27;s Edward Droste; New Zealand singer-songwriter Kimbra; and jazz guitarist-composer Grant Geissman. Of upcoming projects Parks said: &quot;[It will] set poetry to music, to underscore poems. So I will still be performing once I get that done. I will be looking to find a celebrated string quartet to take things to an irreducible minimum. I can pick up a quartet in Peoria, or in Europe, to perform something like this. I also hope to find a film project that interests me.&quot;

==Film and television work==
Parks has also scored much music for feature-length motion pictures and television series, including &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s &quot;Follow That Bird&quot;, Jack Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;The Two Jakes&quot; and &quot;Goin&#x27; South&quot;, &quot;Casual Sex?&quot;, &quot;Private Parts&quot;, &quot;Popeye&quot; (with Harry Nilsson), and &quot;The Company&quot;, and for the &quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Playhouse Christmas Special&quot;.

Parks had four songs featured in the animated film &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot; (1987). He worked closely with David Newman on the film&#x27;s score as well. He composed the theme song for Rudy Maxa&#x27;s &quot;Savvy Traveler&quot; radio program on NPR.

Parks composed the faux-psychedelic song &quot;Black Sheep&quot; (a parody of &quot;Smile&quot; and Brian Wilson&#x27;s style in general) for &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot;, sung by John C. Reilly, who portrays the titular character.

Parks has taken small television and film roles including appearances in &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;The Two Jakes&quot;, and as Leo Johnson&#x27;s defense attorney Jack Racine in episode #2005 of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. The HBO Family series &quot;Harold and the Purple Crayon&quot;, is narrated by Sharon Stone with music and lyrics written and sung by Parks. He and David Mansfield are co-credited with the music for the 2006 miniseries &quot;Broken Trail&quot; (2006).

<text>The Plimsouls were an American rock band known for their hit 1982 single &quot;A Million Miles Away&quot;, which was featured in the movie &quot;Valley Girl&quot;.

==History==
The band was formed in Paramount, California in 1978. They recorded two full-length albums and an EP and then split up in 1984. Different configurations of the original members have reunited intermittently since.

Formed by singer, songwriter and guitarist Peter Case (who had previously fronted the power pop band the Nerves), the Plimsouls began as a trio in 1978, initially named the Tone Dogs, which included Case, bassist Dave Pahoa, and drummer Lou Ramírez. From inception, the band quickly became a crowd favorite in the Los Angeles club scene. Long Beach promoter Stephen Zepeda signed the group to his Beat Records label for a five-song EP called &quot;Zero Hour&quot; which was released in 1980. Guitarist Eddie Muñoz joined the group during the recording of the EP. but did not play on it. (The band&#x27;s name came from a tweaking of &quot;plimsoll&quot;, a type of shoe popular in the UK and favoured by the Beatles.)

Danny Holloway produced the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; EP and managed the group. The song &quot;Zero Hour&quot; received heavy airplay on KROQ-FM, and the Plimsouls grew to be one of the top club draws in the city. Case received critical praise for his songwriting. In 1980, Planet Records signed the group and in February 1981 released their self-titled debut album which Holloway also produced. The single &quot;Now&quot; received strong local airplay in Los Angeles and was also covered by Phil Seymour, appearing on the 2011 CD edition of his second album. Seymour also appeared live with the Plimsouls during the late 1970s, both as a guest vocalist and as an artist on the same bill.

===Second album/&quot;Valley Girl&quot;===
The band received some national attention in 1982 when the single &quot;A Million Miles Away&quot; was released on their own Shaky City record label, distributed by Bomp! Records. The song reached No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Tracks chart and was featured in the 1983 film &quot;Valley Girl&quot;. The band appeared in the film performing the song and parts of two others. The song was also included on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Everywhere at Once&quot;, released May 18, 1983 by Geffen Records. &quot;A Million Miles Away&quot; was re-released as a single in 1983 and peaked at No. 82 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band broke up 1984. Several years later, in 1990, a then up and-coming band named the Goo Goo Dolls covered &quot;A Million Miles Away&quot; on their &quot;Hold Me Up&quot; album. A re-recorded version of the song is also included on the &quot;Speed&quot; soundtrack album.

===Reunion===
Case has continued with a solo career since the band&#x27;s mid-1980s breakup. In 1996, The Plimsouls, without Ramirez, reunited for a few shows and some recording sessions, resulting in a little-heard reunion album called &quot;Kool Trash&quot;. This album featured drumming by new band member Clem Burke, who was also simultaneously a member of Blondie.

The Plimsouls have continued to reunite occasionally since that time, with Burke being replaced by Bryan Head.

In 2016 Muñoz registered a trademark for the band&#x27;s name, and began touring as the Plimsouls, without the involvement of Case, Pahoa, or Ramirez. The Plimsouls brought legal action, which was decided in their favor; the name is owned by the Plimsouls, and &quot;further use by Muñoz of the name would only cause confusion&quot;.

Original Plimsouls bassist David Pahoa passed away in September 2023.

<text>Miracleman (originally known as Marvelman), whose civilian name is Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Moran, is a British Golden Age comic book superhero appearing in comic books first published by L. Miller &amp; Son, Ltd. Created by Mick Anglo, the character first appeared in &quot;Marvelman&quot; #25 (February 1954). The character was subsequently revived in 1982 by Alan Moore and Garry Leach as the lead of &quot;Marvelman&quot; in the pages of &quot;Warrior&quot;. After that publication was cancelled, the revival was continued as &quot;Miracleman&quot; by Eclipse Comics in 1985, with the character renamed accordingly, but went out of print following the company&#x27;s demise in 1994.

After a 15-year hiatus brought on by a confused legal situation, the character was successfully brought back into print by Marvel Comics in 2010, initially reverting to the Marvelman name. From 2014 onwards Marvel began reprinting the revival material, once again using the Miracleman name, and in 2022 began continuing the story.

==Concept and creation==
Following Fawcett Publications&#x27; cessation of their superhero titles in 1953, British publisher L. Miller &amp; Son were left with the prospect of having to cancel their popular &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; and &quot;Captain Marvel Jr.&quot; weeklies due to a lack of material. Len Miller contacted Mick Anglo, whose Gower Street Studio had provided cover artwork and other material for Miller&#x27;s titles, to create a replacement. Anglo modified Captain Marvel, changing his human identity from newsboy Billy Batson to copyboy Micky Moran. The character&#x27;s superhuman form was changed from Captain Marvel to Marvelman, after consideration was given to naming the new character Captain Miracle and Miracleman—both names that would later be used by Anglo for further derivatives of Captain Marvel. Anglo took the opportunity to simplify the character&#x27;s costume, eliminating Captain Marvel&#x27;s cape and switching his lightning bolt to a simpler &quot;MM&quot; chest logo. To provide greater contrast Marvelman was given close-cropped blond hair and a predominantly blue colour scheme. Anglo considered giving the character a gravity belt but eventually decided to retain flight as an inherent ability of the superhero.

While Marvelman and (less frequently, despite debuting concurrently) Young Marvelman are occasionally called the first British superheroes this is not the case as the short-lived DC Thomson &quot;Dandy&quot; character &quot;The Amazing Mr. X&quot; debuted some ten years previously.

==Publication history==
===1954–1963===

Due to the backlog of Fawcett material Miller already had the company was able to prepare readers for the upcoming change. &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; #19, dated 19 December 1953, featured an in-character letter from &#x27;Batson&#x27; to readers, telling them he planned to lead an ordinary life and would be handing over his duties to Marvelman; #24 featured the modified title &quot;Captain Marvel - the Marvelman&quot; and from #25 the title was renamed &quot;Marvelman&quot;, with the new character taking over. A similar process would take place on sister title &quot;Captain Marvel Jr.&quot;, which would become &quot;Young Marvelman&quot;. The result was well-received by readers, and sales of &quot;Marvelman&quot; were actually larger than those of its predecessor. Anglo initially wrote and drew the strips himself; later other Gower Studio artists would work on the character, including James Bleach, Norman Light and Don Lawrence. Marvelman would also occasionally appear in the pages of &quot;Young Marvelman&quot; and later starred the additional monthly title &quot;Marvelman Family&quot;, which also featured Kid Marvelman. However by 1961 sales were declining as imported American comics began to arrive on the British market, featuring full-colour strips rather than the black-and-white adventures of Marvelman. Miller switched &quot;Marvelman&quot; to a monthly reprint title, causing Anglo to unsuccessfully attempt to set up his own Anglo Features label after turning down an offer to work for Miller&#x27;s son Arnold on his own venture. &quot;Marvelman&quot; finally ended in 1963, and the character went into obscurity.

===1982–1985===

In 1981 Dez Skinn opted to revive the character for anthology &quot;Warrior&quot;. After his preferred choices turned him down, he became aware of Alan Moore&#x27;s similar interest in reviving the character and requested a proposal. Impressed by the writer&#x27;s ideas, Skinn commissioned Moore as writer for the strip, which debuted in the first issue of &quot;Warrior&quot; in March 1982. Moore would later relate that he was drawn to the character&#x27;s resemblance of the concept of the Übermensch from the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, a concept that would be frequently drawn on in this revival. After others had demurred, Garry Leach was assigned to draw the strip. He modelled the revised Marvelman on actor Paul Newman and redesigned the chest insignia into a more modern style. Leach and Moore opted for a graceful look for the character in contrast to the more common musclebound superhero archetype.

The strip was a critical success, winning Favourite Comic Character (UK) at the 1984 Eagle Awards, and continued to be a success when Alan Davis took over as artist. Vintage Gower Street material would also be reprinted in the one-off &quot;Marvelman Special&quot;, with the conceit it presented imaginary adventures of the character. However, creative differences between Moore and Davis would lead to the strip stalling in 1985; while Grant Morrison was eager to take over &quot;Marvelman&quot; the dispute would prevent the strip from returning before &quot;Warrior&quot; was cancelled in 1985 after its losses became unsustainable for Skinn.

===1985–1993===
The story was eventually picked up by American publisher Eclipse Comics in 1985. To avoid legal attention from Marvel Comics the series and its leads were renamed Miracleman; Moore had previously suggested this as an alternate title in his original proposal as a substitute name should the editor decide against reviving Marvelman, and had also used it in print for the name of a proxy version of the character that had featured briefly in his parallel work on Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Captain Britain&quot; strip. Those involved do not appear to have been aware of the name being previously considered by Anglo, or its use as the name given to a series of British reprints of the artist&#x27;s Spanish-market &quot;Superhombre&quot;. Moore was initially resistant to the name change due to Marvelman having predated the establishment of Marvel Comics but eventually agreed, though he would air his dissatisfaction with the issue in an essay printed in the second issue of the title. Eclipse began by printing coloured, relettered versions of the &quot;Warrior&quot; material before &quot;Miracleman&quot; #7 (cover dated April 1986) saw the story continue with new material. The series continued its critical success, and was by Eclipse&#x27;s standards a sizeable commercial success. Initially Chuck Austen (then using his birthname Chuck Beckum) drew the new adventures before Rick Veitch continued the work. From &quot;Miracleman&quot; #11, John Totleben became regular artist until #16, which was also the final issue of Moore&#x27;s run.

Moore then passed over the title to Neil Gaiman, having completed the stories he had planned for the character. Gaiman and new artist Mark Buckingham planned three six-issue storylines for the character, and opted for an anthology approach for the initial arc. As such &quot;The Golden Age&quot; focused more on Miracleman&#x27;s impact on Earth than the character himself, who was more felt than seen across &quot;Miracleman&quot; #17-22, largely featuring in cameos by various literary devices such as flashbacks, imaginary sequences and fictions-within-fictions. Meanwhile Gaiman found that numerous other creators were interested in working on the character; to harness this and expand their revenue, Eclipse produced the three-issue limited series &quot;&quot;, featuring contributions by the likes of Alex Ross, Kurt Busiek, Matt Wagner, James Robinson and Darick Robertson. Gaiman and Buckingham provided a framing story for the series which established it as a collection of imaginary stories. Miracleman returned to being more central in the creative team&#x27;s second arc, &quot;The Silver Age&quot;. However, after only two issues of the storyline had been published Eclipse went bankrupt; this also prevented the publication of another spin-off mini-series called &quot;Miracleman Triumphant&quot;, written by Fred Burke and drawn by Mike Deodato and taking place between Gaiman&#x27;s first two arcs.

===1995–2008===

Gaiman mistakenly believed at the time he owned a one-third share of the rights to the Miracleman characters, with the other two-thirds residing with Eclipse. As such he reached an arrangement with Roger Broughton to continue the series once the Canadian publisher purchased Eclipse&#x27;s rights. However at the 1996 liquidation auction Broughton was outbid by Todd McFarlane, who had collaborated with Gaiman on various &quot;Spawn&quot; spinoffs. Gaiman began legal action while McFarlane remained sure he owned the character, and produced Miracleman merchandise. A reimagined Mike Moran, now a principled journalist at the &quot;New York Daily Times&quot;, was added to the supporting cast of &quot;Hellspawn&quot;, a dark spin-off title of &quot;Spawn&quot;, in February 2001. Artist Ashley Wood released teaser images of Miracleman ahead of his planned debut in &quot;Hellspawn&quot; #12. However, Wood left the book after &quot;Hellspawn&quot; #11 and the storyline was abandoned when Gaiman sued McFarlane in 2002. In-universe, the appearances were subsequently ascribed to the character Man of Miracles, whose aspect is shaped by the perceptions of others.

===2009–present===
Since 2001, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada had been among the major industry figures to support Gaiman in the dispute. Marvel eventually discovered in 2009 that the rights to the Marvelman characters had resided with Anglo all along, having never been officially purchased by Skinn (who believed the character was in the public domain, and reached a private agreement with Anglo) in 1981. Marvel licensed the characters from Anglo directly and in 2010 began a series of reprints of classic material under the Marvelman name. In 2014 after further legal rights were secured, Marvel began to reprint the revival material, now named &quot;Miracleman&quot; once again. Marvel published new material with the character in 2015, and Miracleman&#x27;s logo was featured in the one-shot &quot;Timeless&quot; in 2021, foreshadowing his introduction to the Marvel Universe.

In October 2022, Gaiman and Buckingham continued The Silver Age storyline after a hiatus of nearly 30 years.

==Fictional character biography==
===Original===
Having discovered the keyword to the universe through his experiments, Mississippi-based astro-scientist Guntag Barghelt travels the world searching for a worthy recipient of this power. After young Micky Moran first attempts to return a dime Barghelt dropped and then defends the scientist from a trio of hoodlums, the scientist takes the youth to his laboratory. There further tests reveal Micky has absolute integrity and a well-defined discernment of good and evil, and treats him in his atomic machine. Micky is granted the power to turn into the superpowered Marvelman whenever he speaks the keyword &quot;Kimota&quot;. After Marvelman thwarts an attempt by the villainous Herman Schwein to capture Barghelt&#x27;s notes, the scientist withdraws to an asteroid in outer space, knowing Marvelman will protect good on Earth. Micky works for the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; newspaper as a copyboy and keeps his superhero identity secret from the world while using his power to protect the innocent. To help him fight evil, Marvelman would later call on the scientist again when impressed by the courage of messenger boy Dicky Dauntless, and calls up Barghelt once again. The scientist gives Dicky an elixir that allows him to transform into Young Marvelman, who would become Marvelman&#x27;s ally in the fight against evil. Marvelman later selected another youth, Johnny Bates, who was granted the ability to become Kid Marvelman.

Among his many victories, Marvelman prevented Boromanian spy Balco from using the experimental XB999 atomic bomber aircraft against Washington, prevented crooks from poisoning Oklabama&#x27;s water supply with radium, and foiled an attempt by Professor Gargunza to use memory-loss gas on the world. Marvelman also crossed paths with mad scientist Dr. Gargunza, thwarting his plan to use animated skeletons to intimidate a judge. Gargunza would however return with numerous other amoral plans, which Marvelman again defeated.

Other escapades Marvelman was involved in included preventing Boromanian attempts to sabotage Professor Jowik&#x27;s new megabathysphere; stopping the ice cream-crazed Abominable Snowman and his Snowman minions; defeating super-computer the Electronic Brain,; foiling a Boromanian plot to use scientist Doctor Ramado&#x27;s miniaturised hydrogen bomb to blow up a table tennis tournament; saving oblivious astronaut Professor Swivelhead from his own oblivious behaviour; clearing his name after circus strongman the Great Anvello framed him as a criminal; defeating scientist Cuprini&#x27;s evil mirror image version of himself; preventing destruction of a United States Navy squadron by a two-headed kraken; dealing with an epidemic of insomnia brought on by the King of the Land of Nod sulking; using a demonstration of his formidable powers to cause Martian War Lords to abort a planned invasion of Earth; stopping jealous electrical genius Austin Amps and his attempts to sabotage rival Oswald Ohms&#x27; all-electric town Wattingham; 
travelling back to 1588 and helping Royal Navy Captain Farnaby warn England about the Spanish Armada; ending the crime spree of Professor Coisson&#x27;s Marvelman II, a robot double of the hero; foiling the attempt of unlicensed dentist Mr. Nook to use misery gas in revenge for being exposed as a quack by Moran; putting an end to Nazi Otto Gruber&#x27;s attempt to create a Fourth Reich; beating wizard Wizzo the Wizard and his mirror-henchman namlevraM; capturing embezzler Charles Crank despite his attempts to hide out on the Moon}; thwarting the attempts of Menzari driver Heinz Vifter to beat rival Nevady driver Micky Desmond to the Golden Wheel via sabotage;
exposing pickpocketing clowns from a travelling circus; forestalling an invasion from underground hat-wearing giant ants; undoing disgruntled prop manager Eddie Gay&#x27;s attempts to sabotage a documentary made by Peakpoint Films;
uncovering cargo cult-leading machine Klashna;
and halting elderly bad-luck projecting nuisance Irwin M. Trouble

He would also team up with Young Marvelman and Kid Marvelman as the Marvelman Family to face threats such as Garrer and his army of time-travelling renegades; a combined alliance of Marvelman&#x27;s arch-enemy Doctor Gargunza and his nephew, Young Marvelman rogue Young Gargunza; the King of Vegetableland; invaders from the planet Vardica; would-be dictator Professor Batts and his speech-scramber; a crime boss intent on sinking Pacific City below the ocean; the cruel, slave-driving King Snop of Atlantis (which the story revealed would eventually become Australia); an attempt by Gargunza to declare himself King of the Universe; cruel 14th century knight Simon de Carton (clearing the name of Amadis of Gaul in the process); a monster accidentally collected from the planet Droon; and Professor Wosmine&#x27;s shrinking ray

===Revival===

==== Book One: &#x27;A Dream Of Flying&#x27; - written by Alan Moore ====
Two decades later, Mike Moran is a middle-aged man working as a freelance journalist and happily married to Liz, but he is suffering from mid-life crisis and is plagued by headaches. He remembers nothing of his adventures as Miracleman, but has recurring dreams of flying and of the terrible fate that apparently befell the Miracleman family when they were caught in a nuclear explosion.

When a peaceful protest at an atomic power station is overtaken by terrorists, Moran is present and is taken hostage. In the throes of a migraine - he sees the ‘magic word’ (that has eluded him for decades but haunts his dreams) written on a glass door: ‘Kimota’. When he speaks this aloud he transforms into Miracleman, incapacitates the terrorists and flies away.

Miracleman returns home to a startled Liz and attempts to explain his newly-remembered backstory. Liz is initially skeptical but eventually convinced, and they spend the night together.

Miracleman’s appearance is noticed by Johnny Bates, who has become a very successful international businessman in the intervening decades. Bates invites Mike and Liz to his offices, and though they are initially convinced by his story Mike confronts Bates with his suspicions that he has become corrupted by his powers. These suspicions are confirmed when Kid Miracleman attacks. Transforming into Miracleman, Moran attempts to fight Kid Miracleman but is overpowered and only spared by Bates mistakenly speaking his ‘magic word’ and transforming back into a young boy. Miracleman and Liz escape, leaving the young Johnny Bates in the hands of the authorities.

As a result of their single night together, Liz becomes pregnant with Miracleman’s child, an event that fuels Mike Moran’s feelings of inadequacy in comparison to his superhuman alter-ego.

The ‘Spookshow’, a government agency, recruits Evelyn Cream to kill Moran. Cream instead kidnaps Moran and they agree to work together to discover Miracleman’s real origins. This leads them to a hidden bunker in the countryside where Miracleman encounters various ineffectual traps and a deranged superhuman called Big Ben, who he subdues effortlessly.

Once inside the bunker, Miracleman is confronted with the true nature of his past: he is the result of an experimental program by the British government to create superhumans as an escalation of the Cold War arms race. The program is derived from alien technology discovered in the 1950s and adapted and overseen by Dr Emil Gargunza, an ex-Nazi scientist given shelter by the British government. It is revealed that his entire past has been a virtual reality fiction created to subdue him and the rest of the Miracleman Family and make them pliable as super-weapons. Enraged by this, Miracleman destroys much of the bunker and, once calmed by Cream, returns home.

==== Book Two: &#x27;The Red King Syndrome&#x27; - Written By Alan Moore ====
As the birth of her and Miracleman’s child grows near Liz is kidnapped by Gargunza, now living in Paraguay, where Liz is taken. Whilst she is held captive Gargunza relates to her his life story, telling of how he worked on the Zarathustra Project, adapting the technology of a crashed spaceship and creating the Miracleman Family. He hopes to transfer his consciousness into the body of Miracleman’s child, thus achieving immortality.

Miracleman and Cream travel to Paraguay and confront Gargunza. However, Gargunza has implanted another ‘magic word’ which changes Miracleman back into a defenceless Mike Moran for an hour. He then sets his ‘Miracledog’ - a monstrous, genetically altered super-animal - on Moran and Cream. Cream is killed and Moran is maimed but he remembers the ‘magic word’ Gargunza used on the dog and it reverts back to its harmless original form, whereupon Moran kills it and evades Gargunza’s mercenaries until such time as he can change back to Miracleman. When he does, he slaughters Gargunza’s guards, kills Gargunza and rescues Liz who then gives birth to a daughter, Winter - who can already speak.

Back in England, domestic tensions between Mike and Liz are exacerbated by Liz’s mood swings - which she suspects are caused by Winter, who is developing at an unusually accelerated rate. Meanwhile two alien agents are tracking Moran, but are themselves being followed by a mystery woman.

==== Book Three: &#x27;Olympus&#x27; - Written By Alan Moore ====
The aliens - of the race The Qys - attack Moran, who becomes Miracleman and attempts to fight them off, but the aliens are able to change bodies in a manner similar to Moran / Miracleman himself and easily defeat him. Upon learning of Winter’s existence, they turn their attention to Liz but are thwarted by the mystery woman, who reveals herself to be Avril Lear - Miraclewoman - and tells the story of her past as another of Gargunza’s experiments.

The Qys take Miracleman and Miraclewoman to their homeworld where the future of the Miracleman Family - and Earth itself - is discussed by the ambassadors of the Qys and their mortal enemies the Warpsmiths. Miraclewoman convinces the assembly that Earth should be a neutral world wherein the two cultures can work together and hopefully achieve some form of understanding.

After returning to Earth Miracleman finds himself growing apart from his human ties as Liz leaves him and Winter [who is physically a small child but already beyond even Miracleman himself in terms of mental development] leaves Earth to find and learn from The Qys.

Mike Moran, his life turned upside down, commits a form of suicide by trekking into the wilderness and leaving a small memorial for himself to find when he transforms for a last time into Miracleman. Miracleman understands this gesture and never returns to his human form again.

With the help of Qys and Warpsmith agents including Aza Chorn, the initial alien/superhuman project is to gather together all the remaining superhumans on Earth and work in secret to begin to nudge Earth towards a more enlightened path. This is cut short, however, by the sudden re-emergence of Kid Miracleman. 

Johnny Bates, who has been kept at a children’s home in England, has been attempting to keep his alter-ego at bay; but the brutal abuse he suffers at the hands of fellow inmates forces him to transform into a vengeful Kid Miracleman, who then destroys half of London in Miracleman’s temporary absence and kills forty thousand people. When he is discovered, a battle ensues where Miracleman and his cohorts - with apparently little regard for human life - attempt to subdue him.

Kid Miracleman is only eventually defeated by a dying Aza Chorn and, mortally wounded, transforms back to Johnny Bates. Miracleman then kills Bates to prevent him ever becoming Kid Miracleman again. In the ruins of London, surrounded by thousands of dead and dying, Miracleman now realises the world can never be the same. 

He and Miraclewoman reshape the world into a utopia. All the practical ills of human society are cured, and the offer of superhuman powers and children is gradually taken up by a humanity who regard the Miracleman Family as gods. The pantheon of new gods build Olympus, a huge temple in the ruins of Central London where they are worshipped by human acolytes. Despite having created a utopia, Miracleman is haunted by Liz’s accusation that he has lost touch with his humanity.

==== Books Four and Five: &#x27;The Golden Age&#x27; &amp; &#x27;The Silver Age&#x27; - Written By Neil Gaiman with Mark Buckingham ====
After a series of short stories detailing the effects of this new society on ordinary humans and supporting characters from the series [&#x27;The Golden Age&#x27;], the main story picks up again in the year 2001 [&#x27;The Silver Age&#x27;], where Young Miracleman - Dickie Dauntless - is revived but has a great deal of trouble adjusting to the new world he finds himself in.

Miraclewoman convinces Miracleman that Dauntless is infatuated with him, and Miracleman attempts to kiss him to assuage his frustrations. This shocks and enrages Dauntless, whose attitudes towards sexuality and the world in general are still very much those of the 1950s. He leaves Olympus to discover himself in the changed world of 2001. Landing in the Himalaya mountains, a bewildered Dauntless ends up meeting Bill Caxton (Mister Master), the first superhuman created by Miracleman and also the only to ever give up his powers. Inspired by this experience, and accompanied by the somewhat directionless but enhanced Meta-Maid, Dauntless finds the orphanage where he grew up prior to being abducted by Gargunza. In an extended flashback, Dauntless remembers the physical and mental abuse he experienced before changing back to his Young Miracleman form and vowing to confront Miracleman. 

In the finale of this series, Miracleman meets Young Miracleman who after rebuking his options and criticising this present world states &quot;I&#x27;m going to be your adversary. Not now. But One Day. I&#x27;m going to be the opposition. If this is Eden, I&#x27;m going to be the Serpent.&quot;. Ultimately agreeing to these terms, Miracleman lets Young Miracleman leave where he starts meditating for prolonged periods and begins a social movement. Under Miraclewoman&#x27;s encouragement, Miracleman unofficially cedes Australia for Young Miracleman. In the final panels of the series, Young Miracleman hears the voice from Kid Miracleman from infra-space asking to be let out.

The series is to be concluded in Book 6, The Dark Age. 

==Powers and abilities==
Miracleman can fly, has super-strength and is invulnerable. The source of his strength and durability is a forcefield, derived from Qys technology. He is able to tear open a bunker door without apparent effort, push his finger through a human chest without any sort of run-up, and clapping his hands together causes a concussive blast that deafens those within range. Miracleman survives being in the range of the Operation Dragonslayer nuclear bomb unscathed, only being forced into dormancy by the physical and mental damage done to Mike Moran, and is impervious to bullets, blades, rocket launchers and conventional explosives. He can survive without oxygen, and is able to singlehandedly carve Silence from subsea rock. Liz finds his speed cannot be measured by a stopwatch, estimating it as well over Mach 2. In the original, the character could fly around Earth fast enough to move backwards or forwards in time, an ability that has yet to be featured in the revival.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Timothy Adams of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; called Miracleman a &quot;classic superhero.&quot; Michael Doran of &quot;Newsarama&quot; included Miracleman in their &quot;Best Marvel characters left to adapt to the MCU&quot; list. Danilo Raul of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; ranked Miracleman 7th in their &quot;Obscure Marvel Characters That Deserve Their Own Films&quot; list.

==Other versions==
An alternate version of Miracleman is one of the heroes of Earth-238 that appears in the &quot;Captain Britain&quot; stories written by Moore and Alan Davis around the time of their work together on &quot;Marvelman&quot; for &quot;Warrior&quot;. A grave bearing the name is seen by Captain Britain shortly before he is killed by the Fury on the alternate world; the character&#x27;s death at the hands of the symbiote was then shown in flashback during a nightmare experienced by
Linda McQuillan (the superhero Captain UK). Moore would later recall that they came up for the name for the Marvel appearances but it features in his original proposal for the &quot;Warrior&quot; strip as an alternate title, but it was the first use of the name in print. When asked, Moore could not recall if he remembered using it when settling on renaming Marvelman for Eclipse Comics.

<text>Rudolphus Franciscus Marie &quot;Ruud&quot; Lubbers (; 7 May 1939 – 14 February 2018) was a Dutch politician, diplomat and businessman who served as prime minister of the Netherlands from 1982 to 1994, and as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from 2001 to 2005. He was a member of the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP), which later merged to become the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) party.

Lubbers studied Economics at the Erasmus School of Economics obtaining a Master of Science degree and worked as a corporate director for the manufacturing company Hollandia in Rotterdam from April 1963 until May 1973 and as trade association executive for the Christian Employers&#x27; Association (NCW) from January 1965 until May 1973. After the election of 1972 Lubbers was appointed as Minister of Economic Affairs in the Den Uyl cabinet taking office on 11 May 1973. Lubbers was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives after the election of 1977 serving from 8 June 1977 until 8 September 1977. Following the cabinet formation of 1977 Lubbers was asked to become Minister of Housing and Spatial Planning in the new cabinet but declined and returned as a Member of the House of Representatives on 22 December 1977, serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Economic Affairs. Following the resignation of parliamentary leader Willem Aantjes Lubbers was selected as his successor taking office on 7 November 1978.

Shortly after the election of 1982 incumbent prime minister and CDA leader Dries van Agt unexpectedly announced he was stepping down and Lubbers was unanimously selected as his successor as Leader and the &quot;de facto&quot; next prime minister. Following cabinet formation of 1982 Lubbers formed the first Lubbers cabinet and became prime minister taking office on 4 November 1982. For the election of 1986 Lubbers served as lead candidate and after a cabinet formation formed the second Lubbers cabinet and continued as prime minister for a second term. For the election of 1989 Lubbers again served as lead candidate and following another successful cabinet formation formed the third Lubbers cabinet and continued as prime minister for a third term. In October 1993 Lubbers announced he was stepping down as Leader, and that he would not stand at the election of 1994 or serve another term as prime minister. He left office at the installation of the first Kok cabinet on 22 August 1994.

Lubbers semi-retired from active politics and became active in the public sector as a non-profit director and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government, he also served as a distinguished visiting professor of international relations and globalization at the Tilburg University and the John F. Kennedy School of Government of the Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts from February 1995 until December 2000. In November 2000 Lubbers was nominated as the next United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees serving from 1 January 2001 until 20 February 2005. Following his retirement Lubbers continued to be active in the public sector and worked as an advocate, lobbyist and activist for humanitarian, conservation, environmentalism, sustainable development and climate change issues. He was subject to some scrutiny, such as a sexual harassment scandal in 2004 which led to his resignation from the United Nations.

Lubbers was known for his abilities as a team leader and consensus builder. During his premiership, his cabinets were responsible for major reforms to social security, stimulating privatization and sustainable development, revitalizing the economy following the recession in the 1980s and reducing the deficit. Lubbers was granted the honorary title of Minister of State on 31 January 1995 and continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until his death at the age of 78. At 43 years, he is the youngest prime minister of the Netherlands. He was the longest-serving prime minister with until Mark Rutte overtook this record on 2 August 2022. He is consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as one of the best prime ministers after World War II.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rudolphus Franciscus Marie Lubbers was born on 7 May 1939 in Rotterdam in the Province of South Holland. He studied economics at the Erasmus University Rotterdam, and was a student of the first Nobel Prize in Economics laureate Jan Tinbergen. As suggested by the title of his 1962 thesis – &quot;The influence of differing productivity trends in various countries on the current account of the balance of payments&quot; – his main interest was in monetary affairs. He originally planned an academic career, but was compelled by family circumstances to join the management of Lubbers&#x27; Construction Workshops and Machinery Fabricators Hollandia B.V.

===Politics===
From 11 May 1973 to 19 December 1977, Ruud Lubbers was Minister of Economic Affairs in the Den Uyl cabinet and a member of the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP). He was an effective, if sometimes somewhat bad-tempered minister. He chose to return to Parliament on the formation of the Van Agt-government in 1977, becoming senior deputy parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the alliance between the KVP and the other two main Christian parties. His career got an unexpected boost when the leader of the parliamentary faction of the CDA, Willem Aantjes, had to resign in 1978 because of accusations that he had served in the Germanic-SS during the Second World War. Lubbers succeeded him and suddenly found himself in a powerful political position.
In 1982, after the general election won by Prime Minister Dries van Agt, a similar thing happened when Van Agt suddenly announced he would not serve for a third term. Lubbers took over the post. He was the youngest prime minister in Dutch history; he had turned 43 only six months earlier. Major aspects of his time in office included extensive cutbacks in public spending, the launch of far-reaching deregulation and privatisation programs, and a massive demonstration in The Hague (1983) against the planned installation in the Netherlands of nuclear-armed U.S. cruise missiles (which was cancelled after all due to arms reduction talks between the US and the Soviet Union).
After leaving office in 1994, Lubbers was put forward as a candidate for the head of NATO, but the U.S. vetoed his appointment. He was on the advisory board of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), where he was regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system.

Lubbers was regarded by many during his time in office as an ideological heir to Margaret Thatcher. One of his campaign slogans was: &quot;Meer markt, minder overheid&quot; (more market, less government).

===Ecological activities===

In the follow-up of the Earth Summit in 1992, Lubbers engaged with the Earth Charter Initiative in cooperation with Mikhail Gorbachev and Maurice Strong. The Earth Charter document was launched in the Peace Palace in The Hague in June 2000. Lubbers was an active member of the international Earth Charter Commission and reached out, especially to youth in the Netherland, with the message of the Earth Charter for a sustainable and peaceful world.

===Academic===

From 1995 to 2000, he taught Globalization Studies at Tilburg University in the Netherlands and at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in the United States. He was also vice-chairman of the Independent World Commission on the Oceans and chair of Globus, the Institute for Globalization and Development based in Tilburg.

===UN High Commissioner for Refugees===
At the end of the year 2000, Lubbers was appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan to succeed Sadako Ogata as UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
From 1 January 2001, Lubbers headed the UNHCR, which comprised over 5,000 employees who work across the globe, and which was concerned with an estimated 21 million refugees and internally displaced in over 120 countries worldwide. During his tenure, the number of refugees worldwide decreased by almost 22%, from 21.8 million in 2001 to close to 17.1 million at the beginning of 2004.

Lubbers also favoured a generous refugee policy for the Netherlands, and he was critical of the Foreign Citizens Law (Vreemdelingenwet). He also stabilised the UNHCR&#x27;s financial situation and greatly increased the financial means for the sheltering of refugees.

He annually donated some $300,000 to the refugee agency since he assumed his post in 2001, thereby covering his own $167,000 annual salary and travel expenses.

====Sexual harassment complaint====

In May 2004, Lubbers was accused by Cynthia Brzak, an American UNHCR employee, of sexual harassment following a meeting in his office that was attended by two other UNHCR staff members. The complaint was reported in the media, prompting Lubbers to inform UNHCR staff about the accusation. On this occasion, he denied any wrongdoing and rejected the allegation against him. On 2 June 2004, the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), which was tasked with investigating the accusation, sent its report to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In its public annual report to the UN Secretary-General (presented to the UN General Assembly), the OIOS reported concerning the case that it had &quot;submitted a report to the Secretary-General supporting the allegations and recommended that appropriate actions be taken accordingly.&quot;
Lubbers responded to the OIOS report in a letter setting out to (a) deny acts of sexual harassment or abuse took place; (b) establish that such evidence of the alleged misconduct as is said to exist is insufficient and flawed; and (c) conclude that the report itself would appear to be based on an irregular statutory basis and also flawed by errors of law and reasoning.&quot;
Lubbers asked Max van der Stoel, former High Commissioner on National Minorities, to comment on the confidential report. He concluded that &quot;the OIOS report is deficient in objectivity and impartiality.&quot; He added &quot;that the only two other persons in the room did not provide evidence confirming the version given by the complainant.&quot; Furthermore, he accused UN officials of leaking information to the press and recommended that an investigation of the leaks be undertaken.

The Secretary-General reviewed the report and the responses of the High Commissioner and the senior manager to the report, and decided that the complaint could not be substantiated by the evidence and therefore closed the matter.&quot; He is also reported to have consulted with Stephen Schwebel, an American judge and former President of the International Court of Justice. The Secretary-General failed to order an investigation of the deliberate leaking by OIOS itself to the media as recommended by Max van der Stoel.

====Resignation====
In February 2005, the case was in the news again when the British daily newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; obtained a copy of the OIOS report and, accompanied by an article by Kate Holt, published its contents.

Lubbers met with the Secretary-General on 18 February 2005, and resigned as High Commissioner on Sunday, 20 February 2005, stating to the press: &quot;For more than four years I gave all my energy to UNHCR. To be frank, despite all my loyalty, insult has now been added to injury and therefore I resign as High Commissioner.&quot; The Secretary-General&#x27;s office issued a statement the same day which stated that the High Commissioner&#x27;s resignation was in the best interests of the UNHCR. In his letter of resignation, Lubbers stated that his resignation constituted no expression of guilt, but that he had become the victim of smearing, adding that he had resigned &quot;in the interest of the organisation&quot;. In October 2005, Annan reiterated that he had come to the conclusion that &quot;the evidence did not support the accusation&quot; but that, because of ongoing media-pressure, Lubbers&#x27; resignation was in the best interests of the UNHCR.

During a farewell meeting for Lubbers as High Commissioner for Refugees, he received from Acting High Commissioner Wendy Chamberlin the first annual UNHCR Achievement Award for exceptional services to UNHCR and for the world&#x27;s refugees.

In a formal statement, Netherlands Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende called the departure of Lubbers &quot;bitter&quot;, since the complaint against him had been dismissed as unsustainable.

===== Handling of the UNHCR/SC-UK 2002 report on sexual exploitation in the aid sector in West Africa =====

Three years prior to the controversy over the sexual harassment case, Lubbers was criticised for his handling of the UNHCR/SC-UK 2002 which uncovered the widespread sexual exploitation of refugee children by aid workers and peacekeepers in three West African countries (Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone). The study team which had encountered these findings unexpectedly whilst conducting a broader assessment documented 67 allegations implicating 40 aid agencies and several peacekeeping battalions, and often involving humanitarian workers and peacekeepers exchanging meagre aid supplies for sex with children.
Lubbers&#x27; response was to deny these findings, discredit the authors and excuse these behaviours; for example in a CNN interview on 8 May 2002, Lubbers was heard to deny the problem in the face of CNN&#x27;s own research which confirmed the problem existed and was taken to task by the interviewer for dismissing these exploitative relationships &quot;inter alia&quot; as &#x27;romances&#x27;. The UN General Assembly passed resolution A/RES/57/306, &#x27;Investigation into sexual exploitation of refugees by aid workers in West Africa&#x27; in May 2003, requiring the UN to take action at the highest level to tackle such abuses. This led to the UN Secretary-General&#x27;s Bulletin, &#x27;Special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse&#x27; in October 2003, and an endorsement of the Inter-agency standing Committee&#x27;s working group on sexual abuse and exploitation which had already been set up a year earlier in June 2002 in response to the report.

===Informateur===

After the fall of the Second Balkenende cabinet, Lubbers became the &quot;informateur&quot; for the formation of the demissionary interim Third Balkenende cabinet.

For the 2010 Dutch cabinet formation, after coalition meetings between People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, Labour Party, Democrats 66, and GreenLeft failed to form a new Purple government, Lubbers was asked again to become Informateur to seek possibilities for a new coalition.

==Personal life and death==
On 10 October 1962, Lubbers married (1940–2024) and had two sons and one daughter, Paul, Bart and Heleen.

Lubbers died in Rotterdam on 14 February 2018, at the age of 78. Among the world leaders who offered condolences were former President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev, Prime Minister of Russia and former President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, Secretary-General of the United Nations and former Prime Minister of Portugal and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi and President of the European Commission and former Prime Minister of Luxembourg Jean-Claude Juncker. His ceremonial funeral was held in Rotterdam on 20 February 2018 and was attended by Prime Minister Mark Rutte and all living former Prime Ministers Dries van Agt, Wim Kok and Jan Peter Balkenende and other high-profile (former) politicians. This was also the last public appearance of his successor as Prime Minister Wim Kok, who himself died eight months later at the age of 80.

In 2024 it was revealed Lubbers died via euthanasia after having been diagnosed with vascular dementia some years prior.

<text>Andreas Antonius Maria &quot;Dries&quot; van Agt (; 2 February 1931 – 5 February 2024) was a Dutch politician, jurist and diplomat who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 19 December 1977 until 4 November 1982. He was a prominent leader of the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP) and later its successor party, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA).

Van Agt was known for his abilities as a skilful debater and negotiator. During his premiership, his cabinets were responsible for several major public sector and civil service reforms and further reducing the deficit following the recession in the 1980s. Van Agt continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until he suffered a major stroke in May 2019 which forced him to undergo rehabilitation. He held the distinction as the oldest living and earliest serving former prime minister following the death of Piet de Jong in July 2016, until his own death in February 2024.

==Early life==
Andreas Antonius Maria van Agt was born in Geldrop, Netherlands in a Roman Catholic family. After receiving his diploma Gymnasium-A at the Augustinianum, he studied at the Catholic University of Nijmegen, where he received his Doctorate in Law in 1955. After graduating, he practised law in Eindhoven until 1957, after which he worked in the office of legal and business affairs of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries until 1962. From 1962 to 1968, he worked for the Ministry of Justice.

==Political career==

===Minister and deputy prime minister===


Van Agt entered politics as a member of the Catholic People&#x27;s Party, which merged with the other two major Christian democratic parties in 1980 to form the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). From 1968 to 1971, Van Agt was Professor of Criminal Law at the Catholic University of Nijmegen. From 1971 to 1973, he served as Minister of Justice in the first and second Biesheuvel cabinets. He caused outrage when he tried to pardon the last three Nazi war criminals still in Dutch prisons (known as The Breda Four) in 1972. From 1973 to 1977, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice in the Den Uyl cabinet.

In 1976, Van Agt was elected the first Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal, then still a federation of the three confessional parties: the Christian Historical Union, the Catholic People&#x27;s Party and the Anti-Revolutionary Party, which contested with a united list for the first time in the 1977 general election (the merger followed in 1980). With Van Agt as its lead candidate, the Christian Democratic Appeal reversed years of decline in 1977 and returned to power.

===Prime minister in the Van Agt I cabinet===
In the parliamentary election of May 1977, the Labour Party (PvdA) obtained its largest number of seats, so a second Den Uyl cabinet seemed likely. However, the tension between the Catholic People&#x27;s Party and the Labour Party in the last coalition, combined with the fact that a coalition between the Christian Democratic Appeal and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) was possible, the talks failed after a period of seven months. Eventually Van Agt negotiated a deal with VVD leader Hans Wiegel. From 19 December 1977 to 11 September 1981, Van Agt served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of General Affairs in the Van Agt I cabinet.

===Prime minister in the Van Agt II cabinet===
In 1981 general election, the CDA and the VVD both lost parliamentary seats, so a continuation of the CDA–VVD coalition was not possible, and Van Agt was forced to enter into a coalition with the Labour Party and the Democrats 66 (which, under Jan Terlouw, had gained a significant number of seats). Three months of difficult negotiations resulted in the Van Agt II cabinet (11 September 1981 – 29 May 1982). In this composition, Van Agt worked with Joop den Uyl again as Den Uyl was made Deputy Prime Minister and &quot;super minister&quot; of Social Affairs and Employment. The characterological and political differences led to several divisions, and in May 1982 the government fell.

The personal strife between Van Agt and Den Uyl had deteriorated to such an extent that when Den Uyl died from a brain tumor in 1987, Van Agt was not invited to the memorial service by the family. Den Uyl&#x27;s wife Liesbeth argued that Van Agt had prevented the second Den Uyl cabinet from forming in 1977.

===Prime minister in the Van Agt III cabinet===
The caretaker government continued as a minority cabinet, with only ministers from the parties Christian Democratic Appeal and Democrats 66, in the Van Agt III cabinet. For replacing the six Labour Party ministers, five new Christian Democratic Appeal and Democrats 66 ministers were appointed, while Van Agt, in addition to being prime minister, took the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs upon him.

A new parliamentary election was planned for September 1982. Although Van Agt by this point was worn out, he was persuaded to lead his party&#x27;s list again, but shortly after the election he withdrew as a candidate for prime minister and was succeeded by Ruud Lubbers.

==After politics==
===Diplomat===
Dries van Agt served as Ambassador of the European Community to Japan from 1987 to 1990 and to the United States from 1990 to 1995. From 1995 to 1996, he was a Visiting Professor of International Relations at the University of Kyoto.

===Professor===
Until his death, Van Agt was Prime Counsellor for the International Forum for Justice and Peace, a foundation under Dutch law, registered at the Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam. Chaired by retired international businessman Ben Smoes, they are currently focused on justice and peace in regard to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

===Activism===

Van Agt lectured in Cairo in May 2006 at the invitation of the Egyptian electronic magazine Arab-West Report about great changes in the cultural climate of north-western Europe in the past decades, becoming more hostile to religion, including Islam. Muslims, he argued, need to understand those changes to be able to respond better to European criticism of Islam and the Muslim world.

Van Agt also spoke against the Council of State in Egypt for continuous delay in granting the Center for Arab-West Understanding (CAWU) the NGO status. He met with prominent figures in Egypt to persuade them to do so. The Egyptian Council of State, after van Agt&#x27;s visit to Cairo in 2006, ruled on 18 February 2007 that the center should be recognized as an NGO under Egyptian law, ending its three-year struggle to obtain this status. Egypt is known for its reluctance in granting NGO status to discourage political participation. Cornelis Hulsman, a Dutch sociologist, the editor-in-chief of Arab-West Report, and the head of CAWU, stated that van Agt&#x27;s effort significantly impacted the realization of their goals, which usually requires a lengthy amount of time and scrutiny in its political purposes.

For some years, Van Agt took an outspoken stance regarding the Middle East, resulting in a fierce criticism of the policies undertaken by the government of Israel with regard to the Palestinians. When in office, Van Agt was a staunch supporter of Israel, but after he stepped down in 1982, he changed his mind. According to his own words an important turning point was a visit at the late nineties at Bethlehem University on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He accused Israel of &quot;state terrorism&quot; and turning the Palestinian Authority territories into &quot;bantustans&quot;. 

In 2009, Van Agt founded The Rights Forum, a non-profit organization aimed at promoting a “just and sustainable Dutch and European policy regarding the Palestine/Israel issue”. In 2012, he said that Jews should have had a state in Germany instead of Israel. In September 2016, in reference to the visit of Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu to the Netherlands, Van Agt argued that the ongoing Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and the building of settlements there constituted a war crime under the Rome Statute and suggested that Netanyahu should have been sent to the International Criminal Court.

==Personal life and death==

Van Agt was known for his use of archaic language and complicated phrasing, as well as for his love for cycling. He married Eugenie Krekelberg in 1958, and they had three children and seven grandchildren, including professional cyclist . In 2012, he joined the Advisory Board of the International Museum for Family History. Van Agt lived in Heilig Landstichting, near Nijmegen, until his death.

Van Agt and his wife, after choosing euthanasia, died on 5 February 2024, three days after his 93rd birthday. According to family, the couple died holding hands. Van Agt had previously suffered a debilitating brain hemorrhage while giving a speech in 2019.

<text>Johannes Marten den Uijl (9 August 1919 – 24 December 1987), better known as Joop den Uyl (), was a Dutch politician and economist who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1973 to 1977. He was a member of the Labour Party (PvdA).

Den Uyl studied Economics at the University of Amsterdam obtaining a Master of Economics degree and worked as a civil servant at the Ministry of Economic Affairs from February 1942 until May 1945 and as a journalist and editor for &quot;Het Parool&quot; and &quot;Vrij Nederland&quot; from May 1945 until January 1949. Den Uyl served as director of the Wiardi Beckman Foundation from January 1949 until June 1963. Den Uyl became a Member of the House of Representatives shortly after the number of seats was raised from 100 to 150 seats following the election of 1956 serving from 6 November 1956 until 5 June 1963 as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Economics. Den Uyl was appointed as Minister of Economic Affairs in the Cals Cabinet, taking office on 14 April 1965. After Labour Leader Anne Vondeling unexpectedly announced he was stepping down, Den Uyl announced his candidacy and was selected as his successor as Leader on 13 September 1966. In the election of 1967 Den Uyl served as &quot;Lijsttrekker&quot; (top candidate) and became Parliamentary leader, taking office on 23 February 1967. In the election of 1972 Den Uyl again served as &quot;Lijsttrekker&quot; and after a long cabinet formation formed the Den Uyl Cabinet and became Prime Minister of the Netherlands, taking office on 11 May 1973.

The Cabinet collapsed on 22 March 1977 following years of tensions in the ruling coalition. During the election of 1977 Den Uyl served as &quot;Lijsttrekker&quot; but following a difficult cabinet formation failed to create a new coalition. Den Uyl left office following the installation of the First Van Agt Cabinet on 19 December 1977 but continued to serve in the House of Representatives as Parliamentary leader. For the election of 1981 Den Uyl again served as &quot;Lijsttrekker&quot; and following a cabinet formation with his successor— the leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal, Dries van Agt— formed the Second Van Agt Cabinet with Den Uyl appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Social Affairs and Employment, taking office on 11 September 1981. The cabinet fell just seven months into its term and was replaced with the caretaker Third Van Agt Cabinet, with Den Uyl resigning on 29 May 1982. For the election of 1982 Den Uyl again served as &quot;Lijsttrekker&quot; and returned to the House of Representatives as Parliamentary leader, taking office on 16 September 1982. For the election of 1986 Den Uyl once again served as &quot;Lijsttrekker&quot; but shortly thereafter announced he was stepping down as Leader on 21 July 1986 and endorsed former trade union leader Wim Kok as his successor though continued to serve in the House of Representatives as a backbencher. In October 1987 Den Uyl was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and died just three months later at the age of 68.

Den Uyl was known for his abilities as a skillful debater and as an idealistic and determined leader. During his premiership, his cabinet were responsible for major social reforms and dealing with several major crises such as the 1973 oil crisis, the Lockheed scandal, Moluccans incidents and the fallout of the Yom Kippur War. He holds the distinction as leading the most left-wing Dutch cabinet, and his premiership is seen as divisive with both scholars and the public, from considering him to have been average to him having been one of the best Prime Ministers since World War II.

==Early life==



Johannes Marten den Uijl was born on 9 August 1919 in the town of Hilversum. He was born in a Calvinist Reformed family. His father, Johannes den Uyl, was a shopkeeper and a basket weaver who died when Den Uyl was 10. Den Uyl attended the Christian Lyceum, the modern-day Comenius College, in Hilversum from 1931 to 1936. Following this he studied Economics at the University of Amsterdam. During this period in his life he left the church. In 1942 he attained the doctorandus degree. Until 1945 he was a civil servant at the National Bureau for Prices of Chemical Products, part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. During that period he was part of the underground newspaper group that published the clandestine &quot;Het Parool&quot;. After World War II, Den Uyl worked for &quot;Het Parool&quot;, &quot;Vrij Nederland&quot; and other former resistance papers. From January 1949 to 1963 he was the head of the Wiardi Beckman Stichting, the think tank of the social democratic Labour Party. In 1953, at the invitation of the American government, Den Uyl stayed in the United States for a few months, gaining an appreciation of the American experience.

==Political career==
In 1953 Den Uyl was elected to the municipal council of Amsterdam and in 1956 he was elected to the House of Representatives. In 1963 he became municipal administrator for economic affairs in Amsterdam, resigning his parliamentary seat. He resigned that post in 1965 to become Minister of Economic Affairs in the Cals cabinet. As the responsible minister, he decided to close the uneconomic coal mines in Limburg, causing high local unemployment. Following the parliamentary elections of 1967, he became leader of the Labour Party in parliament.

Den Uyl&#x27;s Labour Party won the 1972 election in alliance with the progressive liberal Democrats 66 and radical Christian Political Party of Radicals, but failed to achieve a majority in parliament. After lengthy negotiations, he formed Den Uyl cabinet with the Christian democratic Catholic People&#x27;s Party and Anti-Revolutionary Party. This cabinet faced many problems. An early problem was the 1973 oil boycott following the Dutch support of Israel in the Yom Kippur war. Den Uyl said in a speech on national television that &quot;things would never return to the way they were&quot; and implemented fuel rationing and a ban on Sunday driving.

Between 1973 and 1977, the country&#x27;s economic situation turned ugly. The government&#x27;s budget deficit increased tenfold, inflation approached 10 percent, the unemployment rate doubled, and the current account went from positive to negative – the latter a critical problem in a country that rises or falls on foreign trade. Despite economic difficulties, however, real incomes grew from 1973-1977. According to a 1978 budget memorandum, the real disposable income of the “modal worker” (a statistical concept, as noted by one study, ‘similar to the OECD&#x27;s &quot;average production worker&quot; but at a somewhat lower level of earnings’) went up by 10.3%, for minimum wage earners by 17.8%, and retired people by 27.3%. The government also enacted a wide range of progressive social reforms, such as significant increases in welfare payments, the indexation of benefits and the minimum wage to contractual private sector wage developments and a system of rent rebates (1975), Kindergartens and primary schools with high percentages of children from lower income families were provided with extra facilities (including more money and teachers) and cooperation was stimulated between schools and social and cultural institutions. In addition, 3 local compensatory education and family involvement projects that had been initiated in the early Seventies in Utrecht, Rotterdam and Amsterdam were subsidized by the Ministry of Education under the terms of a new educational development policy. The Primary Education Act of October 1974 gave more freedom to school heads regarding the programming of the curriculum, and an Act of June 1974 made supplementary benefits available to unemployed persons who accepted lower paid- work, with those over 45 receiving supplements &quot;amounting to 100% of their former wage during the first six months; 95% in the next six months, and 85% during the second, third and fourth year; those under 45 receive supplements amounting to 90% during six months, 85% during the next two years.&quot; In addition, a law of June 1976 enabled employees aged sixty, two years after the first date of receipt of benefits (WWV scheme), to continue receiving them until the age of sixty-five. The purpose of this legislation was to improve the financial circumstances of older employees who are unemployed for a long time. In August 1976, job protection was introduced during pregnancy and for 12 weeks following childbirth. The number of years of full compulsory education were increased, and an Act on equal pay in the private sector was introduced. In addition, investments were carried out in social services, such as home care services for families.

In 1975, a rent readjustment grant was adopted “to assist households that were capable and desirous of living in better accommodations, but who were intimidated by the sudden increase in rent and the burden of moving costs.” Various types of tenants were eligible, such as those leaving a slum dwelling for a higher rent unit (“slum clearance”). From 1 January 1975, the elderly “who rely solely or almost exclusively on the AOW pension have been granted an additional reduction of NLG 18 per month on the premium for health insurance for the elderly.” Also, with retroactive effect from 1 July 1975, “a new regulation for relocation and refurbishment costs applies to elderly people who want to move from a cheaper to a more expensive home.” In 1975 the social assistance standard was again structurally increased for incomplete families. In 1974 and 1975, the social assistance standards structurally increased more than the net minimum wage. In 1975, national legislation was introduced for residential homes (previously, homes for the elderly had been a responsibility of local authorities).

Taking into account the fact that the dilapidation of private (rental) homes can seriously impede the efficient implementation of urban renewal plans, a regulation was drawn up at the end of 1976 in connection with this “that provides for the granting of financial support to municipalities and approved institutions when they purchase homes from private individuals with the aim of providing the residents of such homes with a reasonable level of living enjoyment for a considerable period of time after a major improvement. For larger municipalities in particular, this aid measure can be an incentive to purchase homes from private owners.” From 1976 onwards, “schemes have been in place under which grants have been provided for the adaptation of accommodation for the disabled.” In 1976, a separate subsidy scheme was introduced for young single persons. In 1976, a law provided a cash benefit equal to the old-age benefit for disabled heads of families (including the unemployed and self-employed) and disabled single persons aged 17 and over, including those disabled since childhood. Previously, only employed persons for eligible for these benefits. The same law provided for rehabilitation benefits for homemakers. This law also provided for special transport, retraining and reimbursement of extra expenditures incurred as a result of handicaps “on the condition that these services are not provided by other social security legislation.” 

A regulation was introduced in September 1973 providing for the employment of persons &quot;for whom it is difficult to find employment and who have been in prolonged unemployment.&quot; In January 1974, a statutory minimum wage for young people between the ages of 15 and 22 was introduced, and in March 1974 the insurance scheme for wage and salary earners was extended to cover the costs of physiotherapy treatment &quot;where this has been prescribed by a doctor.&quot; Under a decree of 19 July 1974 unemployed civil servants and their survivors were entitled to certain benefits. The National Standardization Decree of 3 July 1974 provided rules for the provision of assistance for generally necessary subsistence costs. According to one report &quot;In 1974 the National Assistance Decree came into effect. A social minimum now applied to various types of households: a standard amount that was considered sufficient to cover the general necessary costs of existence.&quot; The decree established general rules for the determination of the social assistance level. Net benefits according to the ABW (Public Assistance Act) were fixed at 100 % of the net minimum wage for a married worker aged 23 and elder, and the minimum benefits for breadwinners in the social insurance schemes were finally equalized to minimal wage in 1975. As a result of this decree, “the basic standard of social assistance benefit for a couple without children became equal to the net minimum wage of the married employee without children.” According to one study &quot;The National Standards Decree (BLN) from 1974 was of great importance. In addition to the fact that the BLN contains rules for determining assistance with the general necessary costs of existence, it also meant that the level of benefits was raised to the level of the legal minimum wage. The BLN severely limited the policy freedom of municipalities in the implementation of the law. Nevertheless, there remained uncertainty about the interpretation of the concept of general subsistence costs. The BLN only contains a general description, namely: the costs that cannot be regarded as special necessary subsistence costs determined by individual circumstances.&quot; In 1974 the AOW was linked to the minimum wage and therefore became welfare-fixed. After the ABW (Public Assistance Act) was linked to the minimum wage in 1974 lone parents were allowed to keep about a third of their earnings in addition to the benefit, up to a maximum of 25% of the minimum wage. In 1974, the holiday allowance became part of the national standardization and was therefore included in the National Standardization Decree. As noted by one study, &quot;The fixed minimum wage could best serve as a guideline for this. That goal was definitively achieved in 1974: social assistance benefits, the AOW, the widow&#x27;s benefit and the basic benefits of the Sickness Benefits Act, WAO, WW, WWV all amount to one hundred percent of the net minimum wage, around a thousand guilders per year.&quot; Also, as noted by another study, &quot;Partly under the influence of the increase in unemployment since the oil crisis of 1973, a hardship clause was added to the Social Security Act in July 1974 through a change in the National Standards Decree. As a result, you can claim benefits without your entire baptismal certificate being examined by social work. From 1975, everyone from the age of sixteen without a fixed income is entitled to a social assistance benefit.&quot; A modest amount of money was released for self-employed persons as an old-age provision through the National Group Regulation on the release of old-age provision for special groups (Stb. 1974, 825). As noted by one study, the National Group Scheme for the release of old-age provision for special groups (Stb. 1974, 825) “envisaged exemption from (part of) the assets of a former self-employed person in the means test for social assistance.” 

In September 1975, a regulation on the promotion of vocational training for young people was introduced, aimed at &quot;a great number of young people who, as a result of the present educational system, depend on on-the-job training within the framework of the Apprenticeship Law.&quot; The chances of obtaining an individual rent subsidy were also significantly increased, while an Act of June 1975 amended a number of existing Acts &quot;with a view to introducing changes regarding the organisation and the districts of factory inspection and the inspection of ports and dangerous machinery,” and also conferred legislative powers on the Minister of Social Affairs under the Act &quot;concerning the loading and unloading of ocean-going vessels and extended the scope of the Silicosis Act.&quot; Early retirement measures were also implemented, with the Den Yyl government being the first administration to do this.

The Collective Redundancy (Notification) Act of 1976 imposed an obligation on employers (who intend to collectively dismiss employees) &quot;to give written notice of this intention to the relevant trade unions for consultation,&quot; while that same year consultative works councils were replaced by powerful ones modelled after the German works councils. Also in 1976, a law was passed forbidding dismissal upon pregnancy or marriage for all women. In 1976, a Criminal Injuries Compensation fund was set up. Extra money was also spent on urban renewal, while the arrangement “that allows tenants to get used to a higher rent for a renovated home has been improved.” Various measures were undertaken in the field of road safety, such as compulsory moped helmets and seat belts and the establishment of an alcohol test (breath test). Subsidies were also granted to experiments with Bureaus for Legal Aid.

A February 1976 regulation on accidents in nuclear installations provided for interministerial coordination on measures to be taken &quot;in the event of accidents and for the preparation of an emergency plan.&quot; A law of December 1976 relaxed the conditions for exemption from national insurance contributions or entitlement to pay reduced contributions, and also extended entitlement to orphans&#x27; pensions &quot;to illegitimate children whose mothers are dead and who have not been recognised by their fathers.&quot; The Asbestos Decree of April 1977 prohibited the storage and use of crocidolite (blue asbestos) and materials or products containing crocidolite and also prohibited &quot;the spraying of asbestos or materials or products containing asbestos and their use for thermal insulation or for acoustic, preservative or decorative purposes.&quot; In September 1977, regulations were issued &quot;regarding the conditions under which young persons of 16 and over may exceptionally drive agricultural tractors.&quot; In May 1977, a subsidy scheme for the placing of handicapped persons was introduced.

In 1977, the Den Uyl cabinet fell due to a conflict between Den Uyl and the Catholic People&#x27;s Party Minister of Justice Dries van Agt. The Labour Party entered the subsequent election under the banner &quot;Vote for the Prime Minister&quot;. The Labour Party won by a landslide, receiving over 33% percent of the votes, a relatively large share in the divided politics of the Netherlands at that time, and 53 seats. Labour&#x27;s coalition partner Democrats 66 also made gains, from 6 to 8 seats. However, its other coalition partner, the Political Party of Radicals, lost nearly all its seats, making it impossible for Den Uyl to form a new government that he could count on to support him in parliament. More than 200 days after the election, the Christian Democratic Appeal (a new party that was formed by Den Uyl&#x27;s former coalition partners, the Catholic People&#x27;s Party and the Anti-Revolutionary Party, joined by the smaller Christian Historical Union) formed a cabinet with the liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, supported by a small majority of 77 seats (out of a total of 150).

After being opposition leader from 1977 to 1981, Den Uyl returned to government in 1981. The Labour Party formed a coalition with the Christian Democratic Appeal and the Democrats 66. Den Uyl became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Social Affairs and Employment. Van Agt, by now Den Uyl&#x27;s nemesis, led this cabinet. The cabinet was in constant internal conflict and fell after eight months. The Labour Party won the snap election of 1982, but could not agree on a new coalition with the Christian Democratic Appeal. As a result, Den Uyl returned to parliament and led the Labour Party in opposition until 1986. As leader of the main opposition party, Den Uyl, always a soft-spoken Atlanticist, provided cover for the government&#x27;s controversial decision to place NATO cruise missiles on Dutch soil. In turn, this decision, and a similar one by the Belgian government, satisfied one of the West German conditions for the placement of cruise missiles and Pershing II missiles in West Germany.

==Family and later life==
On 30 August 1944, Den Uyl married Liesbeth den Uyl, née Van Vessem (18 June 1924 – 30 September 1990). They had three sons and four daughters. Of those the eldest Saskia Noorman-den Uyl became a member of parliament for the Labour Party herself serving from 1994 until 2006. Xander den Uyl became a leading figure in ABVAKABO, one of the Dutch labour unions and serves as Member of the Provincial-Council of North Holland for the Labour Party since 2011.

After the elections of 1986, in which the Labour Party won 5 seats but failed to retain its position as largest party, Den Uyl was succeeded as leader of the Labour Party by Wim Kok.

===Death===
On 24 October 1987, the VU University Medical Center announced that Den Uyl had become terminally ill. He died exactly two months later, on Christmas Eve 1987, aged 68, of a brain tumor.

<doc id="98053" wikidata="Q471204" url="?curid=98053" title="Barend Biesheuvel">
<text>Barend Willem Biesheuvel (; 5 April 1920 – 29 April 2001) was a Dutch politician of the defunct Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) now the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) party and jurist who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 6 July 1971 until 11 May 1973.

Biesheuvel studied law at the Free University Amsterdam obtaining a Master of Laws degree and worked as a civil servant for the Provincial-executive of North Holland from September 1945 until January 1952 and as trade association executive for the Christian Farmers and Gardeners Association (CBTB) from January 1952 until July 1959 and as chairman from August 1956. Biesheuvel became a Member of the House of Representatives shortly after the number of seats was raised from 100 to 150 seats following the election of 1956 taking office on 6 November 1956 serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Agriculture, Local Government Affairs and Kingdom Relations. Biesheuvel was also selected as a Member of the European Parliament and dual served taking office on 7 March 1961. After Party Leader Sieuwert Bruins Slot announced his retirement Biesheuvel served as one of the &quot;Lijsttrekkers&quot; (top candidates) for the election of 1963 and following the election was selected as Leader and Parliamentary leader on 5 June 1963. Following a cabinet formation Biesheuvel was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries with the responsibility for Suriname and Netherlands Antilles Affairs in the Cabinet Marijnen taking office on 24 July 1963. The Cabinet Marijnen fell on 27 February 1965 and was replaced by the Cabinet Cals with Biesheuvel continuing his offices. The Cabinet Cals fell on 14 October 1966 and was replaced by the caretaker Cabinet Zijlstra with Biesheuvel again retaining his functions. For the election of 1967 Biesheuvel served as &quot;Lijsttrekker&quot; but following a difficult cabinet formation failed to achieve a coalition and returned to the House of Representatives as Parliamentary leader taking office on 23 February 1967. For the election of 1971 Biesheuvel again served as &quot;Lijsttrekker&quot; and after a successful cabinet formation formed the Cabinet Biesheuvel I and became Prime Minister of the Netherlands taking office on 6 July 1971.

The Cabinet fell on 19 July 1972 just a year into its term and was replaced by the caretaker Cabinet Biesheuvel II with Biesheuvel continuing as Prime Minister. For the election of 1972 Biesheuvel served once again as &quot;Lijsttrekker&quot; but the following cabinet formation resulted in a coalition led by Labour Leader Joop den Uyl. Biesheuvel left office following the installation of the Cabinet Den Uyl on 11 May 1973 and announced his retirement and stepped down as Leader on 15 May 1973.

Biesheuvel retired from active politics at just 53 and became active in the private and public sectors as a corporate and non-profit director and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government, and continued to be active as a lobbyist for the European Union advocating for more European integration. Biesheuvel was known for his abilities as skillful manager and effective Debater. During his premiership, his cabinets were responsible for several major public sector reforms by stimulating further deregulation and endorsing more privatization. Biesheuvel continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until his death at the age of 81 from cardiovascular disease. He holds the distinction as leading the last cabinet in which the prime minister was not from the largest party in the coalition, and his premiership is consistently considered both by scholars and the public to have been below average.

==Early life==

Barend Willem Biesheuvel was born on 5 April 1920 in Haarlemmerliede in the Province of North Holland in a Reformed family, the son of Arie Biesheuvel (born 21 January 1883 in Haarlemmerliede – died 21 May 1952 in Haarlemmerliede) and Johanna Margaretha &quot;Antje&quot; Troost (born 22 February 1881 in Sloten – died 12 December 1955 in Fijnaart). Biesheuvel had three brothers and two sisters. After completing his secondary education at local schools, he graduated in law at the Free University of Amsterdam in September 1945. For the next two years Biesheuvel worked in Alkmaar as secretary to the Food Commissioner for the Province of North Holland. In 1947 he became secretary to the Foreign Division of the Agricultural Society (now the Agricultural Board). In 1952 Biesheuvel became general secretary of the Christian Farmers and Gardeners Association of the Netherlands (CBTB) and in 1959 chairman of that organisation. From the same year he was also a member of the Agricultural Board, the Labour Foundation and the boards of the Centrale Raifeissen Bank and Heidemij.

==Politics==
Between 1956 and 1963 he represented the Anti-Revolutionary Party in the House of Representatives (the lower house of parliament). From 1957 to 1961 he held a seat on the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe and from 1961 to 1963 in the European Parliament.

In the successive administrations headed by Marijnen, Cals and Zijlstra between 24 July 1963 and 5 April 1967 he was Deputy Prime Minister with additional responsibility for matters concerning Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles, and Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.

In 1967 he returned to the House of Representatives and became leader of the parliamentary Anti-Revolutionary Party. During the same period he also chaired the Shipbuilding Board and the Committee on Government Information Reform.

From 1971 to 1973 Biesheuvel was prime minister of the Netherlands.

==After politics==
Following his political career, Biesheuvel went on to occupy many other positions in the public and private sectors. Among other things, he was chairman of the supervisory board of the National Investment Bank, a member of the supervisory boards of OGEM and KLM, and chaired the working party on the Netherlands Antilles, the national advisory committee on the relationship between the electorate and policy-making, the Provisional Council for Transport, Public Works and Water Management and the Interministerial Coordinating Committee on North Sea Affairs (ICONA).

==Personal life==
On 22 November 1945, Biesheuvel married his longtime partner, Wilhelmina Jacoba &quot;Mies&quot; Meuring (born 7 August 1919). They had two daughters and one son. Mies Meuring died on 17 January 1989 at the age of 69. Barend Biesheuvel died in a hospital in Haarlem from cardiovascular disease on 29 April 2001 at the age of 81. Biesheuvel and his wife were buried at the main cemetery in Bloemendaal.

<text>Petrus Jozef Sietse &quot;Piet&quot; de Jong (; 3 April 1915 – 27 July 2016) was a Dutch politician and naval officer who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1967 to 1971. He was a member of the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP), later merged into the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA).

De Jong applied at the Royal Naval College in Den Helder and graduated as an ensign in the Navy and joined the Submarine Service. During World War II he served on the submarine HNLMS &quot;O 24&quot; as First Officer and later as commanding officer and saw action in both the Battle of the Atlantic and the Pacific War. After the War De Jong served as a staff officer and commanded a frigate and destroyer. After the 1959 general election, De Jong was unexpectedly appointed as State Secretary for Defence tasked with Naval Affairs taking office on 25 June 1959. After the 1963 general election, De Jong was appointed as Minister of Defence in the Marijnen cabinet taking office on 24 July 1963. The Marijnen cabinet fell 19 months into its term and was replaced by the Cals cabinet with De Jong continuing his office. The Cals cabinet fell just one year later and was replaced by the caretaker Zijlstra cabinet and De Jong again retained his position. After the 1967 general election, De Jong was elected to the House of Representatives on 23 February 1967. Following several failed coalition attempts De Jong was asked to lead a new cabinet and following a successful cabinet formation formed the De Jong cabinet and became Prime Minister of the Netherlands taking office on 5 April 1967.

For the 1971 general election the Catholics declined to nominate De Jong as lead candidate and shortly thereafter De Jong announced that he would not stand for the election. De Jong left office following the installation of the Biesheuvel I cabinet on 6 July 1971. De Jong continued to be active in politics and was elected to the Senate after the 1971 Senate election and became parliamentary leader serving from 11 May 1971 until 17 September 1974.

De Jong retired from active politics at 59 and became active in the private and public sectors as a corporate and non-profit director and served on several and councils and as a diplomat and lobbyist for several economic delegations on behalf of the government. De Jong was known for his abilities as an effective team leader and skillful negotiator. During his premiership, his cabinet was responsible for several major reforms to education, social security, taxes, overseeing improvement in relations with the former Dutch East Indies, handling the Counterculture of the 1960s, the fallout of the Vietnam War and dealing with several major crises such as the Moluccans incidents. De Jong continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until his death in July 2016 at the age of 101. He holds the distinction as the first prime minister after World War II to complete a full term without any internal conflicts and holds the record as the second longest-lived Prime Minister, after Willem Drees, at . His premiership is consistently regarded both by scholars and the public to have been one of the best in Dutch history.

==Early life==
Petrus Jozef Sietse de Jong was born on 3 April 1915 in Apeldoorn in the Netherlands province of Gelderland in a Roman Catholic family that originated from Friesland, as the sixth of seven children of Joännes Jans de Jong (24 February 1878 – 28 November 1931), a railroad superintendent, and Gijsberta Adriana Schouten (29 December 1877 – 30 June 1957). After leaving secondary school, de Koninklijke Hogereburgerschool (now de Koninklijke Scholengemeenschap), he joined the Royal Netherlands Navy as a midshipman in 1931 and subsequently attended the Royal Netherlands Naval College in Den Helder. In 1934, he received his commission as a sub-lieutenant.




==World War II==
After his graduation in 1934, he served a short time in the Dutch East Indies before he entered service in the Royal Netherlands Navy Submarine Service. On 10 May 1940 Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands and the government fled to London to escape the German occupation. De Jong, then a Lieutenant junior grade, was giving a battlefield promotion and command of the nearly finished submarine HNLMS &quot;O 24&quot; and was ordered to bring the submarine to the HMNB Portsmouth naval base in Portsmouth, England. De Jong successfully navigated the HNLMS &quot;O 24&quot; through English Channel and was awarded the Bronze Cross for bravery on 16 July 1940. De Jong served as First Officer on the HNLMS &quot;O 24&quot; from July 1940 until October 1944 fighting in the Battle of the Atlantic from July 1940 until July 1942 when the HNLMS &quot;O 24&quot; was transferred to the British Eastern Fleet to fight in the Pacific War. On 8 July 1943 De Jong was awarded the Bronze Cross for bravery a second time. On 25 October 1944 De Jong was promoted to lieutenant commander and was appointment as commanding officer of the HNLMS &quot;O 24&quot;. Under his command the HNLMS &quot;O 24&quot; initially continued in the Pacific War. Following the end of World War II De Jong continued to serve in the Royal Netherlands Navy holding several administrative functions. On 14 November 1951 De Jong was appointment as commanding officer of the frigate HNLMS &quot;De Zeeuw&quot; and on 20 October 1951 De Jong was transferred to the Allied Command Channel at the HMNB Portsmouth naval base in Portsmouth, England as a senior staff officer. In April 1953 De Jong was promoted to commander and in March 1955 De Jong was appointment as chief of staff to the Inspector General of the Navy Lieutenant admiral Prince Bernhard and as chief military adjutant and senior &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Queen Juliana. In October 1958 De Jong was promoted to captain and appointment as commanding officer of the destroyer HNLMS &quot;Gelderland&quot;.

==Politics==
===State Secretary===
On 7 June 1959, during a NATO naval exercises near Scotland, De Jong received an unexpected telegram with the orders that he was to report the next day to Vice Admiral Leendert Brouwer, the Commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy himself, De Jong was summoned because of his &quot;appointment&quot; as State Secretary for Defence in the new De Quay cabinet. De Jong was airlifted from HNLMS &quot;Gelderland&quot; by helicopter and transported to the aircraft carrier HNLMS &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;. It was the second time that De Jong was asked for a political office, for the Dutch general election of 1956 he was approached by Carl Romme the leader of the Catholic People&#x27;s Party for a seat in the House of Representatives but De Jong respectfully declined his offer, and stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t have political ambitions, I want to become an admiral&quot;.

During that time the independence of the Royal Netherlands Navy in the Armed forces of the Netherlands was in question, the main focus of the discussion was the new command structure for all the service branches. Both a horizontal-structure and vertical-structure had their proponents and opponents, the Royal Netherlands Navy was historically a proponent of a vertical-structure but the horizontal-structure received increasing support, including from the then Minister of War and the Navy Kees Staf. During the cabinet formation for the De Quay cabinet the decision was made to go with the horizontal-structure and the first step was made with the combining of the Ministry of War and the Ministry of the Navy. With the combining of the ministries a serious efficiency problem in the Ministry of War was discovered, while the Ministry of the Navy was thought to be in an excellent administrative condition.

After his meeting with Admiral Brouwer, De Jong reported to the incoming Minister of Defence Sidney J. van den Bergh, who formally asked De Jong to become the new State Secretary for Defence. De Jong was given a few days to think it over and he used that time to speak with Carl Romme. De Jong informed him that he was not a member of the Catholic People&#x27;s Party but Romme respond by saying: &quot;You are not a member of a different party? No, but you are a Roman Catholic? Then we will we see you as one of us.&quot; Romme did advise De Jong to become a member of the Catholic People&#x27;s Party after six months. On 11 June 1959, De Jong reported back to Van den Bergh and was told about the new horizontal-structure, De Jong who was a proponent of a vertical-structure was left with a few remarks. The next day the meeting was continued in the presence of the incoming Secretary-General for the Ministry of Defence Duyverman who was going to be responsible for all financial and budgetary affairs for the Ministry of Defence. De Jong objected, he thought he could not be politically responsible as the State Secretary for Defence if he was not responsible for all financial affairs for his own department, Van den Bergh became irritated with De Jongs position on the matter and the meeting was adjourned for 16 June 1959.

===Minister===
Immediately thereafter, De Jong served as Minister of Defence in the successive Marijnen, Cals and Zijlstra cabinets.

===Prime minister===
From 5 April 1967 to 6 July 1971, he was Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of General Affairs in the De Jong cabinet. His cabinet was the first Cabinet of the Netherlands since World War II that served a full four-year term without crises.

His cabinet was confronted with a demand for democratic reforms in the society and it decided to democratise colleges and universities after the famous &quot;Maagdenhuisbezetting&quot;. Plans were made to modernise politics by establishing an electoral system with districts or a chosen prime minister, but these plans were not implemented. Meanwhile, a pay pause due to the decision of employers and employees to raise wages was partly revoked after anti-government demonstrations and strikes. The Minister of Economic Affairs Leo de Block resigned, officially as a protest against the wage rise in the metal industry, but another reason was his slow reaction to the inflation and rising prices after the introduction of value added tax. More unrest took shape in demonstrations against the Vietnam War. Internationally, relations with Indonesia improved, resulting in a visit by president Suharto which was, however, overshadowed by the occupation of the Indonesian embassy by Moluccans. The Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia was seen as a reason to increase the defence budget. During his term as Prime Minister of the Netherlands De Jong met with numeral state leaders, including US President Richard Nixon, Presidents of France Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou. He was present in the hospital when Prince Claus announced the birth of his son Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange on 27 April 1967.

After serving as Prime Minister of the Netherlands De Jong became a member of the Senate, where he served from 1971 to 1974 and as the parliamentary leader in the Senate.
In 1972, he was passed by the Biesheuvel II cabinet for the position of Vice-President of the Council of State In 1973, he passed the mayoralty of Eindhoven.

==After politics==
Following the end of his active political career, De Jong occupied many posts in industry and seats on numerous supervisory boards. In December 1990 he was selected to lead a diplomatic mission to Iraq to free Dutch hostages, but ultimately the mission was cancelled.

On 25 March 2010, De Jong, still visibly spirituous and active, gave a speech at &quot;Nieuwspoort&quot; about the publication of the biography of former Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 5th Secretary General of NATO Joseph Luns. On 24 April 2010 during the annual Christian Democratic Appeal party conference, De Jong spoke about former deputy prime minister and Labour Party party leader Wouter Bos and his actions which led to the fall of the Balkenende IV cabinet.

After the 2010 general election, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) suffered a disappointing election result, and &quot;informateur&quot; Ivo Opstelten announced the formation of a new centre-right coalition cabinet composed of the winner of the election, the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), and De Jong&#x27;s own CDA, but with the support of the Party for Freedom (PVV) of Geert Wilders. De Jong spoke out against this support and said that the PVV&#x27;s stand on freedom of religion was a deal-breaker.

On 30 March 2012, De Jong and several other prominent CDA members, including fellow former prime minister Ruud Lubbers, former Ministers of Foreign Affairs Hans van den Broek, Pieter Kooijmans and Ben Bot, former Ministers for Development Cooperation Piet Bukman and Agnes van Ardenne, and former ministers Wim Deetman and Ernst Hirsch Ballin and former State Secretary Karien van Gennip all signed a petition of disapproval of the proposed cuts to the international development budget by the Rutte I cabinet. De Jong responded by announcing that he would leave the CDA if the cuts were implemented. He expressed satisfaction about the fall of the cabinet in 2012, calling it a &quot;lame cabinet&quot;.

De Jong was present at the ascension of Willem-Alexander to the Dutch throne on 30 April 2013. He was prime minister at the time of the King&#x27;s birth. At the age of 98 he was the oldest person attending the ceremony.

On 1 December 2013, De Jong and fellow former prime ministers Dries van Agt and Ruud Lubbers were present at the presentation of the book &quot;Polarisatie en hoogconjunctuur&quot;, a book about Dutch politics in the 1960s. De Jong received the first copy from incumbent prime minister Mark Rutte.

===Reputation and legacy===
During his time as Prime Minister of the Netherlands, he was accused of not showing enough strength and too little action when needed during the social revolution of the 1960s by some of the counterculture of that time. De Jong was frequently labelled as old-fashioned, and that old-fashioned image was reinforced by his bowler hat, which he wore frequently outside, a custom he picked up during his time living in England during World War II. In contrast the &quot;silent majority&quot; were reported to be content with the policies of his cabinet. More than forty years later, De Jong is considered by many to have made well thought-out decisions during his time as prime minister and when needed showed enough strength with a far more progressive ideology than he was credited for at the time.

Politicians from the entire political spectrum have labelled De Jong as one of the better prime ministers of the Netherlands. In an episode of the Dutch television programme &quot;Netwerk&quot; aired in 2005, he is even labelled as perhaps the best postwar Prime Minister of the Netherlands. This view has been shared by numerous high-profile current and former Dutch politicians, including former prime minister Dries van Agt and former deputy prime minister Hans Wiegel, who praised De Jong being perhaps the best prime minister after World War II. Former Member of the Senate and Righteous Among the Nations Johan van Hulst said that of all the prime ministers he worked with in twenty-five years, De Jong was the best. On 23 March 2011, the history channel &quot;Hollanddoc&quot; devoted an episode about his life with the quote &quot;Attention for the least-known prime minister after World War II, but perhaps the most successful: Piet de Jong&quot; In November 2011, the second edition of his in 2001 released biography &quot;Van buitengaats naar Binnenhof. P.J.S. de Jong&quot; (From offshore to Binnenhof. P.J.S. de Jong) became well received and further enhanced his reputation: &quot;He showed himself a team leader with perspective and humor. The ideal manager in a time of crisis of authority, polarization and social unrest.&quot;

De Jong said to Queen Juliana, for whom he had served as aide-de-camp, when he was sworn in as State Secretary for Defence, &quot;Majesty, there you see how a person comes down in the world.&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Majesteit, zo ziet u maar hoe een mens aan lager wal kan raken.&quot;) And in a response to a delicate question of a radio reporter, when asked what his thoughts on pornography were, he said, &quot;As far as I know, pornography is the only working medicine against seasickness.&quot; When later a Belgian minister spoke negatively about the libertarian ideas of the Dutch on pornography, he responded, &quot;Well, the Belgians aren&#x27;t a seafaring people, are they?&quot;

==Personal==
After World War II, De Jong married former resistance fighter Anna Geertruida Jacoba Henriëtte &quot;Anneke&quot; Bartels (8 January 1915 – 6 January 2010). At the time when they met Bartels was serving in the of the Royal Netherlands Navy. They married on 26 June 1947 and had one daughter and two sons, Maria (born 31 May 1948) Jos (born 31 August 1949) and Gijs (born 15 October 1952). Anneke Bartels died on 6 January 2010 two days before her ninety-fifth birthday after suffering from heart and lung illnesses since 2000.

===Longevity===

At the age of , De Jong was the oldest living and earliest-serving former prime minister of the Netherlands and the oldest living former Member of the Council of Ministers of the Netherlands overall. De Jong was the second oldest Prime Minister of the Netherlands by age after Willem Drees who lived to .

==Death==
Piet de Jong died on 27 July 2016 at his home in The Hague at the age of 101. Having survived his wife by six years, De Jong was survived by his three children, eight grandchildren and fifteen great-grandchildren.

<text>Jelle Zijlstra (; 27 August 1918 – 23 December 2001) was a Dutch politician of the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) and economist who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 22 November 1966 until 5 April 1967.

Zijlstra studied Economics at the Rotterdam School of Economics obtaining a Master of Economics degree and worked as a researcher and lecturer at his alma mater before finishing his thesis and graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy in Public economics and worked as a professor of public economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam from October 1948 until September 1952. After the 1952 general election Zijlstra was appointed as Minister of Economic Affairs in the Drees II cabinet, taking office on 2 September 1952. After Party Leader Jan Schouten announced his retirement, Zijlstra was selected as his successor on 23 April 1956. For the 1956 general election, Zijlstra served as lead candidate and was elected to the House of Representatives, becoming parliamentary leader on 3 July 1956. Following a cabinet formation, Zijlstra continued as Minister of Economic Affairs in the Drees III cabinet and stepped down as party leader and parliamentary leader on 3 October 1956. The Drees III cabinet fell on 11 December 1958 and was replaced by the caretaker Beel II cabinet, with Zijlstra retaining his position and also becoming Minister of Finance taking office on 22 December 1958. For the 1959 general election, Zijlstra again served as lead candidate. Following a cabinet formation, Zijlstra continued as minister of finance in the De Quay cabinet. In September 1962 Zijlstra announced that he would not stand for the 1963 general election, and declined to serve in the new cabinet. Zijlstra returned as a distinguished professor of public economics at the Vrije Universiteit and was elected to the Senate after the 1963 Senate election, taking office on 25 June 1963 and serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for finance. Zijlstra also served as director of the Abraham Kuyper Foundation from August 1963 until November 1966. 

Zijlstra continued to be active in politics and in September 1966 was nominated as the next president of &quot;De Nederlandsche Bank&quot;, the country&#x27;s central bank. However, after the Night of Schmelzer, he was persuaded to lead an interim cabinet until the next election. Zijlstra formed the caretaker Zijlstra cabinet and took office as Prime Minister of the Netherlands and minister of finance on 22 November 1966. Before the 1967 general election, Zijlstra indicated that he would not serve another term as prime minister and opted to accept the nomination as head of &quot;De Nederlandsche Bank&quot;. Zijlstra left office following the installation of the De Jong cabinet on 5 April 1967 and was confirmed as chief of &quot;De Nederlandsche Bank&quot;, serving from 1 May 1967 until 1 January 1982.

Zijlstra retired from active politics at 63 and became active in the private and public sectors as a corporate and non-profit director and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government, and continued to be active in advocating for a balanced governmental budget. Zijlstra was known for his abilities as a skilful manager and effective debater. Zijlstra was granted the honorary title of Minister of State on 30 April 1983 and continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until his death from dementia-related illness at the age of 83. He holds the distinction as the shortest-serving Prime Minister after World War II and his premiership is therefore usually omitted both by scholars and the public in rankings but his legacy as a minister in the 1950s and 60s and later as president of &quot;De Nederlandsche Bank&quot; continue to this day.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jelle Zijlstra was born on 27 August 1918 in Oosterbierum in the province of Friesland in a Reformed family, the son of Ane Jelle Zijlstra (born 14 November 1879) and Pietje Postuma (born 6 March 1897), both of whom had also been born in the village. After completing his secondary education, he studied at the Netherlands School of Economics, the predecessor of the Erasmus University Rotterdam. His studies were interrupted twice: first by his period of military service and later when he had to go into hiding in 1942 after refusing to sign the loyalty oath required of students by the Nazi occupation authorities. Even so, he completed his economics degree in October 1945 as a Master of Economics.

Immediately after graduating, Zijlstra became a research assistant at the Netherlands School of Economics and was promoted a year later to senior research assistant and in 1947 to lecturer. In 1948 he was awarded a doctorate as a Doctor of Philosophy with cum laude for his thesis on the rate of circulation of money and its bearing on the value of money and monetary equilibrium. In the same year he was appointed professor of economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

===Politics===
Representing the Anti-Revolutionary Party, Zijlstra successively served as Minister of Economic Affairs in the Drees II, Drees III and Beel II cabinets, and as Minister of Finance in the Beel II and De Quay cabinets between 2 September 1952 and 24 July 1963.

Following his ministerial career, Zijlstra returned to the Vrije Universiteit as professor of public finance, though he also served as a member of the Senate between 1963 and 1966. In 1973 Zijlstra became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. After the fall of the Cals cabinet, Zijlstra headed an interim government as Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of Finance between 22 November 1966 until 5 April 1967.

From 1967 until the end of 1981 he was President of &quot;De Nederlandsche Bank&quot;, the central bank of the Netherlands, and in the course of that period he was also President of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. He has sat on many boards in the public and private sectors.

===Personal===
On 11 March 1946, Zijlstra married his childhood sweetheart Hetty Bloksma (30 January 1921 – 19 November 2013). They had three daughters and two sons, who were born between 1947 and 1961. The last months of life were dominated by his deteriorating health, and he suffered from dementia. Jelle Zijlstra died in Wassenaar on 23 December 2001 at the age of eighty-three Zijlstra, and was buried at the cemetery of the local Reformed Church in Wassenaar. His younger brother Rinse Zijlstra (19 April 1927 – 26 September 2017) was also a member of the House of Representatives, serving from 23 February 1967 until 10 May 1971 and a Senator serving from 12 April 1983 until 13 June 1995 for the Anti-Revolutionary Party and the Christian Democratic Appeal.

<text>Willem Drees Sr. (; 5 July 1886 – 14 May 1988) was a Dutch politician of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (SDAP) and later co-founder of the Labour Party (PvdA) and historian who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 7 August 1948 to 22 December 1958.

Drees was elected to the House of Representatives for the SDAP in the 1933 general election and served as a frontbencher and spokesperson for social affairs. He succeeded Willem Albarda as party leader in 1940 and, following the end of World War II, was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Social Affairs in the national unity Schermerhorn–Drees cabinet. In February 1946, Drees was one of the co-founders of the Labour Party and became its first Leader. After the 1948 general election, Drees led his party through a successful cabinet formation with the Catholic People&#x27;s Party and formed the Drees–Van Schaik cabinet, with Drees becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands, taking office on 7 August 1948.

The Drees-Van Schaik cabinet fell on 24 January 1951 and after a short cabinet formation was replaced by the first Drees cabinet, with Drees continuing as prime minister. For the 1952 general election, Drees served again as lead candidate and following a successful cabinet formation formed the second Drees cabinet and continued as prime minister for a second term. For the 1956 general election Drees once again served as lead candidate and following another cabinet formation formed the third Drees cabinet and continued as prime minister for a third term. The third Drees cabinet fell on 11 December 1958 and shortly thereafter Drees announced his retirement and would step down as Leader and would not serve another term as prime minister. Drees left office upon the installation of the caretaker second Beel cabinet on 22 December 1958.

Drees was known for his abilities as a skilful team leader and effective manager. From 1948 to 1958, his four cabinets were mostly praised and supported by the largest parties in the Netherlands. During his premiership, his cabinets were responsible for several major social reforms to social security, welfare, child benefits and education, overseeing the decolonization of the Dutch East Indies following the Indonesian National Revolution, the fallout of the annexation of former German territory and dealing with several major crises such as the North Sea flood of 1953 and Hofmans scandal.

Drees retired from active politics at 72 but continued to be active as a valued historian and prolific author and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government. Drees was granted the honorary title of Minister of State on 22 December 1958 and continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until his death in May 1988 at the age of 101. He holds the record as the fourth longest-serving and longest-lived Prime Minister at and his premiership is consistently regarded both by scholars and the public to have been one of the best in Dutch history.

==Early life and education==

Willem Drees was born in Amsterdam on 5 July 1886 in an orthodox reformed middle-class family. His father Johannes Michiel Drees, a banker and supporter of Abraham Kuyper, died when Drees was five years old, which left his mother Anna Sophia van Dobbenburgh, his two siblings and himself in a precarious financial situation. Drees could continue studying thanks to the support of his uncle Frits. He attended the three-year &quot;hogereburgerschool&quot; (HBS), supplemented by the two final grades of the Amsterdam Public Trade School. Drees grew up attending Sunday school and catechism, but rejected the Christian creed at the age of eighteen.

He developed an interest in political and social affairs at this time, such as the Boer Wars and the Dreyfus affair. At the Trade School, he met the sons of diamond workers who were united in the General Diamond Workers&#x27; Union of the Netherlands, the most politically and socially developed social democratic labour union at the time. At the age of sixteen, Drees became a member of the Dutch Association for the Abolition of Alcoholic Beverages, and would remain a teetoler for the rest of his life. After attending a speech of Pieter Jelles Troelstra following his election victory in Amsterdam in December 1902, Drees became a democratic socialist. He joined the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (SDAP) on his eighteenth birthday.

Near the conclusion of Drees&#x27; time at the Trade School, the school&#x27;s principal offered Drees a position at a brewery, but he refused due to his opposition to alcoholic beverages. Instead, after obtaining his Bachelor of Accountancy degree in 1903, he started working as a bank teller for the in Amsterdam in July 1903. This work did not satisfy him, however, and he rejected an offer by his uncle Frits for a career in brokerage and insurance. In July 1906, Drees quit his job at the Twentsche Bank and pursued his passion, becoming a stenographer at the municipal council of Amsterdam, and then at the States General of the Netherlands in The Hague from January 1907 until August 1919.

==Political involvement==
===Early career===
Drees became a member of the executive committee of the SDAP&#x27;s The Hague branch in 1910, and the following year, at the age of 25, he was elected as the branch&#x27;s chairman, a position he would keep until 1931. He was first elected to the municipal council of The Hague in 1913, and would keep his seat until 1941. In 1919, Drees became the city&#x27;s second social democratic alderman, alongside Willem Albarda. He was responsible for social affairs until 1931, and for finance and public works after that. In this period, Drees supported the broad coalition that governed the municipality, and was a proponent of a pragmatic, reformist course for the party; he had not supported Troelstra in his call for revolution in the Red Week in 1918. For 22 years, between 1919 and 1941, Drees also held a seat in the Provincial Council of South Holland. Drees was asked to succeed Willem Vliegen as the SDAP&#x27;s national chairman in 1926 and he reluctantly accepted, but after the party&#x27;s secretary and several local branches protested his nomination at the party congress of that year due to Drees&#x27; limited national fame, he withdrew his nomination. The following year, however, he became a member of the national SDAP executive, where he would remain until the party&#x27;s dissolution in 1946.

Drees was elected to the House of Representatives in the 1933 general election, taking office on 9 May 1933 and simultaneously resigning as alderman of The Hague. He served as a frontbencher and spokesperson for social affairs. In the context of the Great Depression, he was a proponent of an active crisis policy of industrial planning and the execution of large-scale public works; he saw industrialisation as the structural solution to mass unemployment. Sooner than other prominent SDAP members, he advocated the devolution of the Dutch guilder. He also strongly opposed the activities of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands and other anti-democratic movements, stating in 1935 that fascists are not opponents but enemies. He likewise rejected cooperation with the Communist Party of the Netherlands. After the SDAP&#x27;s parliamentary leader Willem Albarda was appointed Minister of Water Management in the second De Geer cabinet, Drees was selected to succeed him, becoming parliamentary leader on 10 August 1939. Shortly after the German invasion of the Netherlands, Albarda announced he was stepping down as party leader, and Drees was unanimously selected as his successor on 14 May 1940.

During the German occupation, Drees was taken hostage in Buchenwald concentration camp on 7 October 1940. On 7 October 1941, he was moved to Kamp Sint-Michielsgestel, but he was released on 11 May 1942 due to poor health. After his release, Drees played a prominent role as vice chairman and acting chairman of the illegal Executive Committee of the SDAP, and as a prominent participant in secret interparty consultations. In 1944, he became chairman of the &quot;Contact Commissie van de Illegaliteit&quot; and a member of the &quot;College van Vertrouwensmannen&quot;, which the government-in-exile charged with the preparation of steps to be taken at the time of liberation.

Following the end of World War II, Drees was appointed as Minister of Social Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister in the national unity Schermerhorn–Drees cabinet, taking office on 25 June 1945. In February 1946, he was one of the co-founders of the Labour Party (PvdA) and became its first Leader. For the 1946 general election, Drees served as one of the lead candidates, and following the 1946 cabinet formation continued his offices in the first Beel cabinet. For the 1948 general election, Drees again served as one of the PvdA&#x27;s lead candidates, and following a successful cabinet formation with the Catholic People&#x27;s Party, he formed the Drees–Van Schaik cabinet, with Drees becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands, taking office on 7 August 1948.

===Prime Minister of the Netherlands===
From 7 August 1948 to 22 December 1958, Drees was Prime Minister of the Netherlands in four successive cabinets: the Drees–Van Schaik cabinet, the first Drees cabinet, the second Drees cabinet and the third Drees cabinet. From 1948 to 1958, his four cabinets were mostly praised and supported by the largest parties in the Netherlands. As Roman/Red coalitions, they were formed by the Catholic People&#x27;s Party, the Labour Party and the Christian Historical Union (CHU), supplemented by the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) until 1952, and the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) from 1952 on.

His period in office saw at least four major political developments: the traumas of decolonisation, economic reconstruction, the establishment of the Dutch welfare state, and international integration and co-operation, including the formation of Benelux, the OEEC, NATO, the European Coal and Steel Community, and the European Economic Community.

A wide range of social reforms were carried out during Drees&#x27;s tenure as prime minister. In social security, the Occupational Pensions Funds Act of March 1949 made membership of industry-wide pension funds compulsory, while the General Old Age Pensions Act of May 1956 introduced universal flat-rate old age pensions for all residents as a right and with no retirement condition at the age of 65. The Retired Persons&#x27; Family Allowances Act of November 1950 established a special allowance for pensioned public servants with children (abolished in 1963), a law of November 1950 extended compulsory health insurance to cover other groups such as old-age and invalidity pensioners, and a law of December 1956 introduced health insurance with special low contributions for old-aged pensioners below a certain income ceiling. A law of August 1950 established equal rights for illegitimate children, and introduced an allowance for disabled children between the ages of 16 and 20. This law also introduced monthly (previously annual) fixing of the number of children for whom allowances are claimable. The Temporary Family Allowances Act for the Self-employed of June 1951 entitled self-employed persons with low incomes to family allowance for the first and second child (abolished in 1963), and a law of February 1952 introduced an allowance for studying and for disabled children until the age of 27. In 1949, an unemployment insurance act was passed that came into effect in 1952. This contained redundancy pay insurance &quot;for an initial short period of unemployment and the actual unemployment insurance for the period thereafter.&quot; In 1952 a Social Security Scheme for the Unemployed entered into force on 30 June 1952. It applied to unemployed persons &quot;who, in principle, do not fall under the Unemployment Act or who, in principle, do fall under the said Act, but do not (any longer) receive benefits under the said Act.&quot; The scheme therefore distinguished two groups of employees and had two benefit schemes.

In 1949, an Artist Subsidy Scheme was introduced, under which artists &quot;lacking sufficient income from their profession received a financial provision for a certain time allowing them to continue working.&quot; A Law of 22 June 1950 established the &quot;Praeventiefonds&quot; with the task of making funds available &quot;to take measures aimed at preventing disease or promoting health.&quot; From 1950 to 1957, the &quot;Praeventiefonds&quot; received a separate budget &quot;from the Equalization Fund for supplementary nutrition for TB patients curing at home.&quot; Under the Accident Pension Supplement Act of 26 May 1950, &quot;in certain cases persons who received an annuity or benefit under one of the Accident Acts were granted a supplement to their annuity or benefit.&quot; One journal at that the time commented on the provisions of this law: &quot;The law supplementing accident benefits came into force on 12 June 1950. Pursuant to this law, a contribution of 25% is granted on annuities under the Accidents Act 1921 and the Agriculture and Horticulture Accidents Act 1921, which annuities are calculated on the basis of a loss of fitness to work of more than 25%, if these annuities have been or will be awarded, in connection with an accident, that took place before 1 January 1947 and the person affected was compulsorily insured on the day of the accident. The same allowance is given on the annuities under the Maritime Accidents Act, if these benefits have been or will be awarded in connection with an accident that took place before 1 January 1946. Furthermore, the Minister of Social Affairs has determined that a married woman who is the breadwinner for her husband or for one or more children under the age of 16 is entitled to the allowance, unless her husband already derives rights under the law. The supplement does not apply to those who had an accident after the above dates. Their basic wages, on which interest is calculated, are higher.&quot;

The Pension and Savings Funds Act (PSW) of 1952 improved the vulnerable position of employees in private companies &quot;by obliging the employer who had promised a pension to his employee to cover the pension risk he assumed, either with a pension fund or with an insurance company.&quot; However, the Act &quot;does not oblige the employer to promise a pension: in contrast to the salary, to which the employee is entitled in all cases (cf. Article 1637 g of the Civil Code), the employee is only entitled to a pension if this has been promised.&quot; An Act of 29 September 1955, Stb. 456, amending the Poor Law, introduced an amended regulation regarding the domicile of social assistance, or for the payment of the costs of nursing or care of the sick, disabled and elderly in the appropriate institutions. The aim of the amendment was to provide a more satisfactory arrangement for liability for costs. In 1956, a Hungarian Refugee Assistance Scheme was introduced, along with Provision for the Blind (&quot;Voorziening voor Blinden&quot;). This provision recognized the blind as one of the groups in society entitled to a special benefit. In addition to the normative benefits, benefits tailored to the individual case could also be awarded, &quot;such as expenses for the mental and cultural development of the blind person, costs of education or training and medical treatment or nursing of the blind person in his family.&quot; In 1957, a new social health insurance scheme for indigent pensioners was set up called &quot;bejaardenverzekering&quot; (&quot;elderly insurance&quot;). In January 1958, legal aid was introduced. The General Widows and Pensions Act was also drafted, which was passed under the second Beel cabinet

In terms of working conditions, safety Regulations for Electric Passenger and Goods Lifts with a Cage that can be entered were introduced on 15 June 1949. A Decree further amending the Safety Decree for Factories and Workplaces, 1938 dated January 1950 &quot;adds seven new Sections, 212-212 F to the Safety Decree of 1938. The new sections deal with construction, repair or demolition of buildings, foundations, water works, underground conduits and roads. In addition to general safety provisions, there are provisions concerning the construction and use of scaffolds, floors, gangways, stairs, gangplanks, etc., and hoisting appliances.&quot; Other decrees were issued concerning working hours for various groups. The Silicosis Act of 1951 sought &quot;to prevent and combat dust lung diseases, such as silicosis, caused by inhalation of finely divided quartz dust, e.g. from sandblasting or sandstone processing, and asbestosis, caused by inhalation of asbestos dust.&quot; The Law on dangerous tools of 5 March 1952 contained safety regulations with regard to dangerous tools and protection equipment. In the legislative amendment of 19 January 1955, after a number of failed attempts, the regulation of working and rest times in agriculture was realized in the Labor Act 1919. The Act of 18 June 1953 (Stb. 421) amended the provisions of the Labor Act 1919 on the night work of women and young persons. For instance, the time of commencement of the daily working hours for blue-collar workers under the age of 16 was raised from 5 to 6 hours, and the minimum night&#x27;s rest for young people from 11 to 12 hours. A law of 6 August 1954 established a legal ban on industrial work for 14-year-old girls. In 1950, works councils were established, requiring all enterprises with more than 25 employees to allow their employees to elect representatives. The Industrial Reorganization Act of 1950 made it mandatory for workers to belong to an industrial organizations, which were bipartite associations that represented labor and management interests. These were primarily responsible for administering occupational security programs like disability and pensions. According to one study, &quot;by making participation in the associations mandatory, Drees was able to vastly expand the scope of the workforce covered by social security programs, guaranteeing a greater degree of uniformity in the benefits workers received.&quot; Dismissal law was reformed in 1953, with a scheme introduced &quot;that not only created the possibility of claiming compensation after a manifestly unreasonable dismissal, but also the so-called &#x27;restoration of employment&#x27;.&quot; In 1957 the dismissal of female civil servants upon marriage was abolished.

In the field of housing, the Implementation for Rent Act (1950) fixed rents and rent increases, while the Regional and Town Planning Act (1950) regulated the planning of house building. In addition, the Reconstruction Act of 1950 established housebuilding programmes, and legislation was passed on house building standards (1951), the uniformity of buildings (1954), and uniform building standards (1956). In 1953, a premium scheme for home improvement was set up by the government. From 1956 it was possible for low-income groups to obtain a mortgage guarantee. In education, measures were carried out such as increased expenditure on the system, a reduction in registration fees at state universities and at the institute of technology, and the granting (in January 1956) of a special benefit to primary school teachers and to certain categories of vocational teachers, &quot;particularly those who risk being unemployed and who cannot lay claim to a retaining fee.&quot; From 1951 onwards government grants were provided to &#x27;impoverished young people from very good study aptitude that met reasonable requirements of general development and civilization&#x27; (De Looper, 1997). A doubling of the deduction of costs for learning and studying children aged 16 to 27 from income and wealth tax was achieved, followed by a triple deduction for income, wage and wealth taxes for parents with studying children aged 16 to 27 who lived away from home and who were largely supported by their parents.

Other initiatives included secondary schools for girls and special primary education in 1949, teacher training colleges in 1952, the extension of compulsory education to eight years in 1950, the Nursery Education Act of 1955, which introduced the option of kindergarten for children from the age of four upwards, while also establishing regulations for nursery-school teachers, and the Schoolfees Act of 1955, which abolished all fees up to the school-leaving age. 

A department of social welfare was also established (1952), employment facilities for the disabled were expanded and care for the blind received money. In 1952, a policy framework was set up for dealing with &quot;problem families,&quot; such as subsidies for pillarized family care and social development work in the cities. That same year, the Ministry of Social Affairs began granting subsidies &quot;to promote the employment of the blind, on the one hand through contributions for individual cases (purchase or conversion of equipment, transport, etc.), on the other hand through subsidizing the work facilities of the blind.&quot; Following on from schemes for the blind, equal provisions for other handicapped persons were established in 1955 and 1958. From 1953, subsidies to voluntary agencies serving the physically and the mentally handicapped were included in the budget of the Ministry of Culture, Recreation, and Social Welfare, when they were introduced as an experiment that year. In addition, &quot;Government care for passengers on inland vessels started with the establishment of the Social Commission for Boatmen in 1956.&quot; The Water Supply Act of 1957 sought to achieve sanitation in terms of drinking water quality. In 1957, &quot;the task of the Central Commission for Cultural Work in Labor Camps (CCCA) was modified and expanded and at the same time the Provincial and Local Committees were abolished. The task of the CCCA was formulated as the promotion of the cultural interests of workers, group-housed in housing estates whose operation and/or management falls under the care of the minister and, if necessary, other groups of workers, group-housed outside their places of residence.&quot; The Health Act of 1956 contained new legal regulations concerning regarding the organization of public health care, while the Medicines Supply Act of 28 July 1958, contained new regulations &quot;regarding the supply of medicines and the practice of medical preparation.&quot;

In addition, a number of &#x27;regulation laws&#x27; were passed through parliament including the Insurance Brokerage Act, the Shop Closing Act (including some twenty amendments), development plans for disadvantaged areas and the Credit System Supervision Act.

The third Drees cabinet fell on 11 December 1958 and shortly thereafter Drees announced his retirement from politics. Drees left office upon the installation of the caretaker second Beel cabinet on 22 December 1958. He was granted the honorary title of Minister of State on 22 December 1958 and continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until his death in May 1988 at the age of 101. He continued to be active as a valued historian and prolific author and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government. The Labour Party appointed him a member of its Executive Council for life in 1959. Due to impaired hearing he stopped attending its meetings in 1966. He strongly disagreed with New Left tendencies in the membership and strategies of the Labour Party, and eventually gave up membership of a party he had served for close to 67 years.

==Personal life==
On 28 July 1910, Drees married Catharina Hent (6 May 1888 – 30 January 1974) and had two sons and two daughters. Both his sons Jan Drees and Willem Drees Jr. were active members of the Labour Party, but left the party around 1970 to join the Democratic Socialists 1970. The cause was a row with younger party members who wanted to plot a more radical left-wing course for the party. Drees himself left the Labour Party in 1971 leaving them without their icon, but he never joined the Democratic Socialists 1970.

Drees was a life-long teetotaler. He was also an Esperantist and addressed the 1954 World Esperanto Congress, which was held in Haarlem.

Drees died on 14 May 1988 in The Hague, at age 101. From 22 August 1986, when former Turkish President Celâl Bayar died, until his own death Drees was the world&#x27;s oldest living former head of government.

In 2004 he ended in third place in the election of The Greatest Dutchman.

<text>A member of parliament (MP) is the representative in parliament of the people who live in their electoral district. Members of parliament typically form parliamentary groups, sometimes called caucuses, with members of the same political party. Many countries with bicameral parliaments, this term refers only to members of the lower house since upper house members often have a different title. The terms congressman (or congresswoman) and deputy are equivalent terms used in other jurisdictions.

== Westminster system ==

The Westminster system is a democratic parliamentary system of government modelled after the politics of the United Kingdom. This term comes from the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

=== Australia ===
At the Commonwealth level, a &quot;member of parliament&quot; is a member of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Commonwealth (federal) parliament. Members may use the postnominal &quot;MP&quot; after their names. &quot;MHR&quot; (&quot;Member of the House of Representatives&quot;) was not used, which was affirmed by cabinet in 1901 and reaffirmed in 1951 and 1965. However, the prohibition of &quot;MHR&quot; does not appear to have been strictly enforced, as it was used most recently by Tony Abbott when he was in the parliament (1994–2019). A member of the upper house of the Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, is known as a &quot;Senator&quot;.

==== States and territories ====
In the Australian states and territories, &quot;MP&quot; is commonly used. In bicameral legislatures, members of the lower house (legislative assembly or house of assembly) also use the post-nominals &quot;MLA&quot; or &quot;MHA&quot; and members of the upper house (legislative council) use &quot;MLC&quot;.

MLCs are informally referred to as upper house MPs.

=== Bahamas ===
The Parliament of the Bahamas is the bicameral national parliament of Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The parliament is formally made up by the monarch (represented by the governor-general), an appointed Senate, and an elected House of Assembly. It currently sits at Nassau, the national capital.

The structure, functions, and procedures of the parliament are based on the Westminster system.

=== Bangladesh ===

In Bangladesh, a member of parliament is an individual who serves in the unicameral Jatiya Sangsad or House of the Nation. Members of the Jatiya Sangsad are elected at a general election, usually held once every five years unless Parliament is dissolved sooner by the president on the advice of the prime minister. Under the Constitution of Bangladesh, an individual is required to be a citizen of Bangladesh and must have attained the age of 25 years in order to qualify for election to Parliament.

The Parliament consists of 300 directly elected members from general seats elected by use of first past the post who represent single-constituencies, while 50 seats are reserved exclusively for women and are allocated on a proportional basis. After an election, the Election Commission allocates reserved seats to parties based on the number of general seats they won. A party then presents a list of candidates, each requiring a presenter and a seconder. If the number of candidates presented and seats allocated is equal, then there is no election and the reserved seats are filled in accordance with the candidate lists prepared by parties. In the event there are more candidates than seat allocations, the 300 MPs elected from general seats vote through use of the single transferable vote system to determine the reserved seats. In reality, there has never been an election for reserved seats as parties have never nominated more candidates than they have been allocated. In order to form a Government, a political party or alliance usually requires a simple majority in Parliament. Since Bangladesh&#x27;s independence, the prime minister has concurrently held the position of Leader of the House.

=== Barbados ===

The Parliament of Barbados is the legislative branch of the government of Barbados. It is a bicameral body, composed of an appointed Senate and an elected House of Assembly. The Senate (upper house), the direct successor of a pre-Independence body known as the &quot;Legislative Council&quot;—comprises 21 senators appointed by the president. The President appoints 12 Senators on the advice of the Prime Minister and two on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition.The remaining seven Senators are nominated by the President at their discretion (that is, the President is not bound by other political leaders&#x27; advice in these appointments) to represent various religious, social, economic, or other interests in Barbados. 

In the absence of an opposition leader in parliament (i.e. in the case of a landslide victory where one party takes all 30 seats in the House of Assembly, as occurred in 2018 and 2022) the president will then appoint the remaining two senators in the opposition&#x27;s stead allowing for 9 independents instead.

The House of Assembly (lower house) is made up of 30 members of Parliament, elected to five-year terms on a first-past-the-post basis in single-seat constituencies.

=== Canada ===
The Parliament of Canada consists of the monarch, the Senate and the House of Commons. Only members of the House of Commons are referred to as members of Parliament (); members of the Senate are called Senators (). There are currently 105 seats in the Senate and 338 in the House of Commons. Members of Parliament are elected, while senators are appointed by the governor general on behalf of the sovereign at the direction of the prime minister. Retirement is mandatory for senators upon reaching the age of 75 years.

Each province (and territory) has its own legislature, with each member usually known as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). In certain provinces, legislators carry other titles: Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in Ontario, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) in Quebec () and Member of the House of Assembly (MHA) in Newfoundland and Labrador. The provincial upper houses were eliminated between 1876 (Manitoba) and 1968 (Quebec).

=== Gibraltar ===

In Gibraltar, members of parliament serve in the unicameral Gibraltar Parliament. There are 17 seats in the Parliament, to which candidates are elected by block voting. Each candidate represents the whole of Gibraltar as their constituency.

=== India ===

A member of Parliament is a member of either of the two houses of the Indian Parliament: Lok Sabha (lower house) and Rajya Sabha (upper house). Lok Sabha has 543 seats, all of whom are directly elected by the citizens of India from each parliamentary constituency of states and union territories via first-past-the-post voting. Rajya Sabha can have 245 members, of which 238 members are indirectly elected. Of these 238 members, 229 belong to the state legislatures and 9 belongs to the union territories of Delhi, Puducherry, and Jammu and Kashmir, and are elected by using the single transferable vote method of proportional representation. The remaining 12 members are nominated by the president for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. Each state has a fixed number of representatives allocated in each chamber, in order of their respective populations. The state of Uttar Pradesh has the greatest number of representatives in both houses. The person which secures the support of more than half the seats in the Lok Sabha forms the Government. To form the government, parties may form a coalition.

The term of a member of the Rajya Sabha is six years, while Lok Sabha members are elected for a term of five years, unless the house is dissolved sooner. Rajya Sabha is a permanent house that is not subject to dissolution, and one third of the members retire every two years. Vacancies in both houses, whether because of death or resignation of a member, must be filled by using a bypoll within six months of the vacancy; the newly elected member then only serves the remainder of the term of the seat to which they are elected. The number of seats in both houses is regulated by the Constitution and parliamentary statutes.

=== Ireland ===

Since the formation of the Irish Free State in 1922 and subsequently in the Republic of Ireland, the legislature of Ireland is known as the Oireachtas, and consists of the president; the upper house, Seanad Éireann (or Senate); and lower house, Dáil Éireann (Assembly, or House of Representatives). They are functionally similar to other bicameral parliaments, with the lower house being significantly more influential and having more power over the creation of legislation. Elections to Dáil Éireann are held at least every five years using the single transferable vote; while elections to Seanad Éireann are restricted to members of both houses, elected members of local authorities, and alumni of National University of Ireland colleges. Eleven senators are nominated directly by the Taoiseach.

A Member of Dáil Éireann is known as a Teachta Dála (TD) or &quot;Deputy to the Dáil&quot;, and addressed as &quot;Teachta&quot; (Deputy), while a Member of the Seanad is known and addressed as Seanadóir (Senator). These titles are used much more commonly in English than the official Irish.

A &quot;member of Parliament&quot; was the term used to refer to a member of the pre-1801 Irish House of Commons of the Parliament of Ireland. Irish members elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland were also called &quot;members of Parliament&quot; from 1801 to 1922. Northern Ireland continues to elect MPs to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

=== Jamaica ===

The Parliament of Jamaica is the legislative branch of the government of Jamaica. It is a bicameral body, composed of an appointed Senate and an elected House of Representatives. The Senate (upper house), the direct successor of a pre-Independence body known as the &quot;Legislative Council&quot;—comprises 21 senators appointed by the governor-general: thirteen on the advice of the prime minister and eight on the advice of the leader of the opposition.

=== Malaysia ===

The Parliament of Malaysia consists of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) and two houses, the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot; (the House of Representatives) and &quot;Dewan Negara&quot; (the Senate).

The term &quot;members of Parliament&quot; only refers to members of the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot;. In Malay, a member of Parliament is called &quot;Ahli Parlimen&quot;, or less formally &quot;wakil rakyat&quot; (people&#x27;s representative).

Members of Parliament are elected from population-based single-seat constituencies using first-past-the-post voting. The prime minister must be a member of Parliament.

=== United Kingdom ===


The United Kingdom elects members of its parliament:

* the Parliament of the United Kingdom, with 650 members elected by the first-past-the-post system to the (lower) House of Commons, referred to as members of Parliament, abbreviated to &quot;MP&quot;

and four devolved legislatures:

* the Scottish Parliament, with 129 members elected under the additional member system every five years, and each called Member of the Scottish Parliament (&quot;MSP&quot;; ; )
* the Northern Ireland Assembly, with 90 members each known as Member of the Legislative Assembly (&quot;MLA&quot;; ; Ulster-Scots: &quot;Laa-Makkan Forgaitherar&quot;, LMF). (Between 1921 and 1973, Northern Ireland was governed by the bicameral Parliament of Northern Ireland. Members of its lower house, the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, were known as &quot;Member of Parliament&quot;.)
* the Senedd (Welsh Parliament), with 60 elected members called &quot;Member of the Senedd&quot; (&quot;English - MS&quot;); )
* the London Assembly, with 25 members elected under the additional member system every four years, called &quot;Members of the London Assembly&quot; (&quot;AM&quot;)

MPs are elected in general elections and by-elections to represent constituencies, and may remain MPs until Parliament is dissolved. &quot;If it has not been dissolved earlier, a Parliament dissolves at the beginning of the day that is the fifth anniversary of the day on which it first met.&quot;
(Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022).

A candidate to become an MP must be a British or Irish or Commonwealth citizen, be at least 18 years of age (reduced from 21 in 2006), and not be a public official or officeholder, as set out in the schedule to the Electoral Administration Act 2006.

Technically, MPs have no right to resign their seats (though they may refuse to seek re-election). However a legal fiction allows voluntary resignation between elections; as MPs are forbidden from holding an &quot;office of profit under the Crown&quot;, an MP wishing to resign will apply for the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds or the Stewardship of the Manor of Northstead which are nominally such paid offices and thus result in the MP vacating their seat. (Accepting a salaried ministerial office does not amount to a paid office under the Crown for these purposes.)

The House of Lords is a legislative chamber that is part of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Although they are part of the parliament, its members are referred to as peers, more formally as &quot;Lords of Parliament&quot;, not MPs. Lords Temporal sit for life, Lords Spiritual while they occupy their ecclesiastical positions. Hereditary peers may no longer pass on a seat in the House of Lords to their heir automatically. The 92 who remain have been elected from among their own number, following the House of Lords Act 1999 and are the only elected members of the Lords.

=== Zimbabwe ===

Members of the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, are styled &quot;members of Parliament&quot;, while members of the Senate, the upper house, are referred to as &quot;senators&quot;.

Unofficially the term &quot;Abgeordneter&quot; (, i.e. of a certain electorate) is also common (abbreviated &quot;Abg.&quot;, never follows the name but precedes it).

In accordance with article 38 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, which is the German constitution, &quot;[m]embers of the German Bundestag shall be elected in general, direct, free, equal, and secret elections. They shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience.&quot; An important though not constitutionally required feature of German parliamentarianism is a slightly modified proportional representation.

The 16 federal states of Germany (&quot;Länder&quot;) are represented by the Bundesrat at the former Prussian House of Lords, whose members are representatives of the respective &quot;Länder&#x27;s&quot; governments and not directly elected by the people.

=== Greece ===
Members of the Hellenic Parliament are known as &quot;vouleftés&quot; (βουλευτής, &quot;councillors&quot;) in Greek, which is rendered into English as &quot;members of parliament&quot;.

There are currently 400 deputies and 200 senators, who are elected in general elections held every five years. The president of the Italian Republic nominates five senators for life (&quot;senatori a vita&quot;). Emeritus presidents of the republic are also appointed senators for life. The two houses of parliament together form a perfect bicameral system, meaning they perform identical functions, but do so separately.

=== Empire of Japan ===

In Empire of Japan, both houses of today&#x27;s national parliament, the National Diet (&quot;Kokkai&quot;), are directly elected, and although the two chambers differ in legislative and political authority, term length and age restriction of eligibility, the members of both houses are generally equal in personal status (financial compensation, immunity, etc.). There are currently 710 members of the National Diet (&quot;Kokkai giin&quot;, 国会議員): 465 members of the House of Representatives (&quot;Shūgiin giin&quot;, 衆議院議員) and 245 members of the House of Councillors (&quot;Sangiin giin&quot;, 参議院議員). The former are elected in general/by-/repeat elections of members of the House of Representatives &quot;(Shūgiin giin sō-/hoketsu-/sai-senkyo)&quot;, the latter in regular/by-/repeat elections of members of the House of Councillors &quot;(Sangiin giin tsūjō-/hoketsu-/sai-senkyo)&quot;. Under the 1947 constitution, the prime minister is elected by the National Diet and must be a member of the National Diet, as must the majority of other ministers; by practice, all prime ministers since 1947 have been members of the House of Representatives so far.

Under the constitution of the Empire of Japan, the Imperial Diet (&quot;Teikoku-gikai&quot;) was a bicameral legislature of two houses, generally equal in legislative authority, and while the members of both houses received the same financial compensation - from 1920 and 1947, ¥7500 for the two presidents, ¥4500 for the two vice-presidents, ¥3000 for all other members of both houses, except Imperial princes, dukes and marquesses—their status was different by definition: The upper house consisted mainly of hereditary nobles and lifetime-appointed peers, the lower house of elected commoners. In the First Imperial Diet in 1890, there were initially 551 members of the Imperial Diet (&quot;Teikoku-gikai giin&quot;, 帝国議会議員, or in contemporaneous script 帝國議會議員): 251 members of the House of Peers (&quot;Kizokuin giin&quot;, 貴族院議員) and 300 members of the House of Representatives &quot;(Shūgiin giin)&quot;; of the House of Peers members, 10 were members of the Imperial family, 31 were hereditary members from the two upper nobility ranks, 104 were members elected in mutual elections from the three lower nobility ranks, 61 were lifetime-appointed members (many of these from the bureaucracy) and 45 were members elected by the 15 top taxpayers in each of the 45 prefectures. The number of noble and appointed members of the House of Peers was not fixed and varied gradually over time as members died or new peerages were granted; the number of elected top taxpayer seats, Imperial Academy seats (introduced in 1925), members appointed from the colonies Chōsen/Korea and Taiwan/Formosa (introduced in 1945), and the size of the House of Representatives was fixed by law, but was also changed several times over the decades. The last, 92nd Imperial Diet of 1946–1947 had 839 members - 466 members of the House of Representatives and 373 members of the House of Peers. As the regulations establishing the cabinet &quot;(naikaku)&quot; and the cabinet&#x27;s prime minister &quot;(naikaku sōri-daijin)&quot; were decreed before the Imperial constitution, the prime minister did not have to be a member of the Imperial Diet, but after the establishment of the Imperial Diet in 1890, many prime ministers were appointed from the House of Peers; very few were members of the House of Representatives, &quot;viz.&quot; Takashi Hara, Osachi Hamaguchi, and Tsuyoshi Inukai.

=== Kazakhstan ===
According to the jurisdiction of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the term &quot;deputy&quot; () is the main and widely used word to describe a &quot;member of parliament&quot; () as a whole, encompassing both the lower house Mäjilis and the upper house Senate. While &quot;senator&quot; is also used to interchangeably describe a member of the Senate, the word &quot;deputy&quot; is the inclusive and general term for all 120 members of the Parliament.

The 98 deputies of the Mäjilis obtain their mandate through mixed-member majoritarian representation, with 29 deputies elected from single-member districts and 69 deputies from closed-list proportional representation. The Senate consists of 50 deputies, out of which 40 are indirectly elected by mäslihats (local assemblies), while the remaining 10 are appointed by the President and the Assembly of People.

=== Lebanon ===
The Parliament of Lebanon is the Lebanese national legislature. It is elected to a four-year term by universal adult suffrage in multi-member constituencies, apportioned among Lebanon&#x27;s diverse Christian and Muslim denominations. Its major functions are to elect the president of the republic, to approve the government (although appointed by the president, the prime minister, along with the Cabinet, must retain the confidence of a majority in the Parliament), and to approve laws and expenditure. The name of a deputy in Arabic is &quot;Naeb&quot; (نائب). The plural of &quot;Naeb&quot; is &quot;Nuwab&quot; (نواب).

=== Netherlands ===
The Parliament of the Netherlands is known as the &quot;Staten-Generaal&quot;, the States General. It is bicameral, divided into two &quot;kamers&quot; (English: chambers). The Senate is known in Dutch as the &quot;Eerste Kamer&quot; (First Chamber) and its members as &quot;senatoren&quot;, senators. The House of Representatives, known in Dutch as the &quot;Tweede Kamer&quot; (Second Chamber), is the most important one. The important debates take place here. Also, the Second Chamber can amend proposed laws and can propose laws itself. The Senate does not have these capabilities. Its function is a more technical reviewing of laws. It can only pass a law or reject it. Both chambers are in The Hague, which is the seat of parliament but not the official capital of the Netherlands, which is Amsterdam.

The 150 members of the House of Representatives are elected by general elections every four years (or earlier if the government falls). The 75 members of the Senate are elected indirectly. The members of the twelve provincial parliaments and the councils of the three Caribbean special municipalities elect the senators. The value of a vote of a member of a provincial parliament is weighted by the population of the province. Provincial parliaments, the States Provincial, are elected by general elections every four years; a new Senate is elected three months after the provincial elections.

=== North Macedonia ===

In the Republic of North Macedonia there are 120 members of parliament () called &quot;Pratenici&quot; (singular &quot;Pratenik&quot;).

=== Norway ===
A member of parliament is an elected member of the &quot;Stortinget&quot;. They are called &quot;stortingsrepresentanter&quot; (). Since 2009, Norway has had a unicameral parliament, which previously consisted of the &quot;Odelstinget&quot; and &quot;Lagtinget&quot;; the Odelstinget comprised three-quarters, or 127, of the total 169 members, whereas the Lagtinget comprised the remainder. The dividing of the parliament into chambers was only used when dealing with passing regular laws and in cases of impeachment (&quot;riksrett&quot;). In other matters, such as passing the national budget or changing the constitution (the latter requiring a majority of two-thirds), the chambers were united.

The members of the unicameral parliament of Norway are chosen by popular vote for a parliamentary period of four years.

=== Philippines ===

From 1978 to 1984, the Philippine parliament was called the &quot;Batasang Pambansa&quot; (National Assembly), and its elected members were called &quot;Mambabatas Pambansa&quot; (National Assemblyman), often shortened to &quot;MP&quot;.

=== Poland ===
=== Portugal ===
The Portuguese parliament is called the &quot;Assembleia da República&quot;. A member of parliament is known as a &quot;deputado&quot;, that is, a person who is appointed through democratic election to act on the people&#x27;s behalf.

=== Spain ===
The word parlamento—&quot;of the same origin as Parliament in English—is used as a common name for all legislative assemblies, and hence &quot; for the member of any of them, which can usually refer to members of:
* both chambers of the national legislature (Cortes Generales), the Congress of Deputies and the Senate.
* the regional devolved legislatures of the Autonomous Communities.
* the European Parliament.

Members of the Congress of Deputies are called &quot;diputados&quot; (deputies), implying that they are elected to act in the name and on behalf of the people they represent. It is also usual to call members of the European Parliament &quot;eurodiputados&quot;. Members of the Senate are called &quot;senadores&quot; (senators).

===South Africa===
The Parliament of South Africa consists of two houses: the National Assembly of South Africa (lower house) and the National Council of Provinces (upper house). Members of both houses are given the title &quot;Member of Parliament&quot;.

The National Assembly is made up of 400 members, who are all elected by the public in general elections using a proportional representation system with closed lists. The National Council of Provinces is composed of 90 delegates with 10 delegates for each of the nine provinces regardless of the population of the province. A provincial delegation consists of six permanent delegates and four special delegates. NCOP delegates are elected by the nine provincial legislatures on the day when they reconvene, usually the same day as the National Assembly. The delegates are sworn in the next day.

===South Korea===
A &quot;member of Parliament&quot; refers to a member of the Parliament of South Korea. A total of 253 MPs are elected using the first-past-the-post system from parliamentary constituencies, 30 MPs are elected by proportional compensation, and 17 MPs are elected by mixed member majoritarian.

In the Second Republic of Korea or if the Constitution of South Korea is amended as a parliamentary system with bicameralism, only the members of the House of Commons of South Korea are called members of Parliament, while the members of the Senate of South Korea are called senators.

The members of provincial legislatures are called members of the Legislative Assembly or MLA. In some provinces, such individuals are called as Members of the Provincial Parliament (MPP).

=== Sweden ===
&quot;Members of parliament&quot; refers to the elected members of the Riksdag. In Swedish, an MP is usually referred to as a &quot;riksdagsledamot&quot; (&quot;member of the Riksdag&quot;) or a &quot;riksdagsman&quot; (&quot;gentleman of the Riksdag&quot;). The former is in more common use today, especially in official contexts, due to its status as a unisex word, while the latter was used more often historically and literally refers to a male MP exclusively.

The parliament is a unicameral assembly with 349 members who are chosen every four years in general elections. To become an MP, a person must be entitled to vote (i.e. be a Swedish citizen, be at least 18 years old and be or have been resident in Sweden) and must be nominated by a political party. The MPs are elected by proportionality in constituencies across the nation. To decide which candidate will be elected the modified Sainte-Laguë method is used. This method usually but not always gives an accurate result in proportion to cast votes. 

The salaries of the MPs are decided by the Riksdag Pay Committee (&quot;Riksdagens arvodesnämnd&quot;), a government agency under the Riksdag. Since 1 November 2007, the basic monthly pay of an MP is SEK52,900 (ca. US$6,500). The pay of the speaker is SEK126,000 a month (ca. US$15,000), which is the same as that of the prime minister. The deputy speakers receive an increment of 30% of the pay of a member. The chairs and deputy chairs of the parliamentary committees receive a similar increment of 20% and 15% respectively.

According to a survey investigation by the sociologist Jenny Hansson, Swedish national parliamentarians have an average workweek of 66 hours, including side responsibilities. Hansson&#x27;s investigation further reports that the average Swedish national parliamentarian sleeps 6.5 hours per night.

=== Switzerland ===
=== Thailand ===
In the Kingdom of Thailand, &quot;members of parliament&quot; (; ) refer to the members of the National Assembly of Thailand, that is, the members of the House of Representatives and the senators. Following the military coup d&#x27;état on 19 September 2006, all members of the assembly were suspended from duty until the next election. The assembly was fully reconvened after the general elections under a slightly amended new constitution. Under the 2007 constitution there are 650 members of parliament, consisting of 500 members in the House of Representatives, of which 375 elected from constituencies and the other 125 by party-list, and 150 senators.

=== Turkey ===
In the Republic of Turkey, a member of parliament is an elected member of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (), which has 600 members elected at a general election for a term of office of five years.

=== Ukraine ===
A people&#x27;s deputy of Ukraine (&quot;Ukrainian&quot;: народний депутат України, narodnyi deputat Ukrayiny) is a member of parliament or legislator elected by a popular vote to the Verkhovna Rada (the unicameral parliament of Ukraine). Often people&#x27;s deputies of Ukraine are referred to simply as deputies.

The main statutes that define the order of elections, rights and duties of the people&#x27;s deputies of Ukraine are outlined in Articles 76–81 of the Constitution of Ukraine. There are 450 people&#x27;s deputies of Ukraine who are elected based on the general, equal and direct electoral right for five years. The deputies may be appointed to various parliamentary positions such as the chairperson (speaker) of parliament, a head of a committee or a parliamentary faction, etc. Upon its appointment, to the office, each people&#x27;s deputy of Ukraine receives a &quot;deputy mandate&quot;.

People&#x27;s deputies that run for parliament as self-nominated candidates can join factions if they wish.

<text>Thomas Bulfinch (July 15, 1796 – May 27, 1867) was an American author born in Newton, Massachusetts, known best for &quot;Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology&quot;, a posthumous combination of his three volumes of mythologies.

==Life==
Bulfinch belonged to a well-educated merchant family of modest means. His father was Charles Bulfinch, the architect of the Massachusetts State House in Boston and parts of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.

Bulfinch attended Boston Latin School, Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1814. His main career was with the Merchants&#x27; Bank of Boston.

==&quot;Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology&quot;==
Bulfinch published a reorganized version of the biblical book of &quot;Psalms&quot; to illustrate the history of the Hebrews. However, he is known best as the author of &quot;Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology&quot;, an 1881 compilation of his three previous works:

# &quot;The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes&quot; (1855)
# &quot;The Age of Chivalry, or Legends of King Arthur&quot; (1858)
# &quot;Legends of Charlemagne, or Romance of the Middle Ages&quot; (1863)

&quot;Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology&quot; is a classic work of popularized mythology, the standard for more than a century and still in print. The compilation, assembled posthumously by Edward Everett Hale, includes various stories belonging to the mythological traditions known as the &quot;Matter of Rome&quot;, the &quot;Matter of Britain&quot; and the &quot;Matter of France&quot;, respectively. Bulfinch wrote in his preface:
&quot;Our work is not for the learned, nor for the theologian, nor for the philosopher, but for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets, and those which occur in polite conversation.&quot;
The original volume was dedicated to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Bulfinch described it on the title page as an &quot;attempt to popularize mythology and extend the enjoyment of elegant literature&quot;. In his preface he outlined his purpose, which was

:&quot;an attempt to solve this problem, by telling the stories of mythology in such a manner as to make them a source of amusement. We have endeavored to tell them correctly, according to the ancient authorities, so that when the reader finds them referred to he may not be at a loss to recognize the reference. Thus we hope to teach mythology not as a study, but as a relaxation from study; to give our work the charm of a story-book, yet by means of it to impart a knowledge of an important branch of education. The index at the end will adapt it to the purposes of a reference, and make it a Classical Dictionary for the parlor.&quot;

His obituary noted that the contents were &quot;expurgated of all that would be offensive&quot;.

The versions Bulfinch gives for the classical myths are those in Ovid and Virgil. His Norse myths are abridged from a work by Paul Henri Mallet (1730–1807), a professor at Geneva, translated by Bishop Thomas Percy as &quot;Northern Antiquities&quot; (London, 1770, often reprinted).

Bulfinch&#x27;s versions of these myths are still being taught in many American public schools. Marie Sally Cleary, in &quot;The Bulfinch Solution: Teaching the Ancient Classics in American Schools&quot; (1990), describes the book in the context of &quot;democratizing&quot; classical culture for a wider American antebellum readership. The Bulfinch retellings were largely superseded in American high schools by Edith Hamilton&#x27;s works on mythology, which were based directly on classical Greek texts.

<text>Z88DK is a Small-C-derived cross compiler for a long list of Z80 based computers. The name derives from the fact that it was originally developed to target the Cambridge Z88. Z88DK is a collection of software development tools that targets the 8080 and Z80 family of machines. It allows development of programs in C, assembly language or any mixture of the two. What makes z88dk unique is its ease of use, built-in support for many Z80 machines and its extensive set of assembly language library subroutines implementing the C standard and extensions.

It has been used for many software and hardware projects, notably the REX DK (targeted to the REX 6000 platform) and the S1 SDK (targeted to the S1 MP3 Player) teams.

The compiler is highly portable, and is known to be run on AmigaOS, BeOS, HP-UX 9, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, Win64, Win32, Win16 and MS-DOS.

<doc id="98076" wikidata="Q1226190" url="?curid=98076" title="Lyfing (archbishop of Canterbury)">
<text>Lyfing (died 12 June 1020) was an Anglo-Saxon Bishop of Wells and Archbishop of Canterbury. He was abbot of Chertsey Abbey before becoming bishop at Wells. His appointment to Canterbury came at a time of Danish invasions of England, and he was unable to act as archbishop for a time due to Danish activity. When Cnut, the Danish king, became king of England, Lyfing likely consecrated the new king. Lyfing was known as a wise man and gave gifts to his church and oversaw repairs to his cathedral before his death in 1020.

==Early career==

Lyfing was born &quot;Ælfstan&quot;. He was abbot of Chertsey Abbey from about 989. He became Bishop of Wells in 998 or 999, and in 1013 King Æthelred the Unready appointed him to the see of Canterbury.

==Archbishop==

Lyfing was unable to go to Rome for his pallium, the symbol of archiepiscopal authority, during King Æthelred&#x27;s reign, for every bishop that was consecrated during the remainder of the king&#x27;s reign was consecrated by Archbishop Wulfstan of York. The reason for his inability to secure the pallium was most likely the disorder in England caused by Danish raids and attempts at conquest of the kingdom. By 1018, however, he was acting as archbishop, having returned to England from Rome with letters from Pope Benedict VIII, some of which were for the new king, Cnut, who became king in 1016. These letters exhorted the new king to strive to be a better ruler. As Archbishop of Canterbury, Lyfing crowned two English kings: Ethelred&#x27;s son Edmund Ironside in 1016 and Cnut in 1017. When the coronation of Cnut actually took place and where is unclear, but the 12th-century writer Ralph of Diceto states that Lyfing carried out the ceremony. He seems to have gone to Rome on behalf of Cnut at least once.

A scribe at Canterbury Cathedral records a story that Lyfing was discussing church freedom with Cnut when the king offered to give the archbishop a new charter guaranteeing the church&#x27;s freedom. Lyfing is said to have declined, lamenting that he and the church had a number of charters on those lines, but that did not mean anything so why should another help the situation. The king is then said to have confirmed the church&#x27;s freedom in the same manner as previous kings had. Lyfing also secured from the king lands for the cathedral as well as himself giving gifts to it to decorate the cathedral. He also oversaw the restoration of the cathedral&#x27;s roof. The Lanalet Pontifical, an 11th-century pontifical in manuscript produced in England, has a note that it was once owned by Bishop &quot;Lyfing&quot;, and it is possible that the Lyfing referred was the archbishop of Canterbury, although Lyfing who was successively Bishop of Crediton and Bishop of Worcester is also a possible owner.

==Death and legacy==
Lyfing died on 12 June 1020. He was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, and after his death his remains were first moved to the gallery of the north transept during the time of Archbishop Lanfranc, before eventually being buried near the altar of St Martin. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; called him &quot;a sagacious man, both before God and before the world&quot;.

==History==

===Hartley Institution===
The University of Southampton has its origin as the Hartley Institution which was formed in 1862 from a benefaction by Henry Robinson Hartley (1777–1850). Hartley had inherited a fortune from two generations of successful wine merchants. At his death in 1850, he left a bequest of £103,000 to the Southampton Corporation for the study and advancement of the sciences in his property on Southampton&#x27;s High Street, in the city centre.

Hartley was an eccentric straggler, who had little liking of the new age docks and railways in Southampton. He did not desire to create a college for many (as formed at similar time in other English industrial towns and commercial ports) but a cultural centre for Southampton&#x27;s intellectual elite. After lengthy legal challenges to the Bequest, and a public debate as to how best interpret the language of his Will, the Southampton Corporation choose to create the Institute (rather than a more widely accessible college, that some public figures had lobbied for).

On 15 October 1862, the Hartley Institute was opened by the Prime Minister Lord Palmerston in a major civic occasion which exceeded in splendor anything that anyone in the town could remember. After initial years of financial struggle, the Hartley Institute became the Hartley College in 1883. This move was followed by increasing numbers of students, teaching staff, an expansion of the facilities and registered lodgings for students.

===University College===
In 1902, the Hartley College became the Hartley University College, a degree awarding branch of the University of London. This was after inspection of the teaching and finances by the University College Grants Committee, and donations from Council members (including William Darwin the then Treasurer). An increase in student numbers in the following years motivated fund raising efforts to move the college to greenfield land around Back Lane (now University Road) in the Highfield area of Southampton. On 20 June 1914, Viscount Haldane opened the new site of the renamed Southampton University College. However, the outbreak of the First World War six weeks later meant no lectures could take place there, as the buildings were handed over by the college authorities for use as a military hospital. To cope with the volume of casualties, wooden huts were erected at the rear of the building. These were donated to the university by the War Office after the end of fighting, in time for the transfer from the high street premises in 1920. At this time, Highfield Hall, a former country house and overlooking Southampton Common, for which a lease had earlier been secured, commenced use as a hall of residence for female students. South Hill, on what is now the Glen Eyre Halls Complex was also acquired, along with South Stoneham House to house male students.

Further expansion through the 1920s and 1930s was made possible through private donors, such as Edward Turner Sims&#x27;s two daughters Mary and Margaret for the construction of the university library, to fulfil a request in his will, and from the people of Southampton, enabling new buildings on both sides of University Road. During World War II the university suffered damage in the Southampton Blitz with bombs landing on the campus and its halls of residence. The college decided against evacuation, instead expanding its Engineering Department, School of Navigation and developing a new School of Radio Telegraphy. The university hosted the Supermarine plans and design team for a period but in December 1940 further bomb hits resulted in it being relocated to Hursley House.

Halls of residence were used to house Polish, French and American troops. After the war, departments such as Electronics grew under the influence of professor Erich Zepler and the Institute of Sound and Vibration was established.

=== University ===

On 29 April 1952, Queen Elizabeth II granted the University of Southampton a royal charter, the first to be given to a university during her reign, which enabled it to award degrees. Six faculties were created: Arts, Science, Engineering, Economics, Education and Law. The first University of Southampton degrees were awarded on 4 July 1953, following the appointment of the Duke of Wellington as Chancellor of the university. Student and staff numbers grew throughout the next couple of decades as a response to the Robbins Report. The campus also grew significantly, when in July 1961 the university was given the approval to acquire some 200 houses on or near the campus by the Borough Council. In addition, more faculties and departments were founded, including Medicine and Oceanography (despite the discouragement of Sir John Wolfenden, the chairman of the University Grants Committee). Student accommodation was expanded throughout the 1960s and 1970s with the acquisition of Chilworth manor and new buildings at the Glen Eyre and Montefiore complexes.

In 1987, a crisis developed when the University Grants Committee announced, as part of nationwide cutbacks, a series of reductions in the funding of the university. To eliminate the expected losses, the budgets and deficits subcommittee proposed reducing staff numbers. This proposal was met with demonstrations on campus and was later reworked (to reduce the redundancies and reallocate the reductions in faculties funding) after being rejected by the university Senate.

By the mid-1980s through to the 1990s, the university looked to expand with new buildings on the Highfield campus, developing the Chilworth Manor site into a science park and conference venue, opening the National Oceanography Centre at a dockside location and purchasing new land from the City Council for the Arts Faculty and sports fields (at Avenue Campus and Wide Lane, respectively).

===Research university===
Under the leadership of then Vice-Chancellor, Sir Howard Newby the university became more focused in encouraging and investment in more and better quality research. In the mid-1990s, the university gained two new campuses, as the Winchester School of Art and La Sainte Union College became part of the university. A new school for Nursing and Midwifery was also created and went on to provide training for NHS professionals in central-southern England. This involved a huge increase in student numbers and the establishment of sub-campuses in Basingstoke, Winchester, Portsmouth and Newport, Isle of Wight.

In the autumn of 1997, the university experienced Britain&#x27;s worst outbreak of meningitis, with the death of three students. The university responded to the crisis by organising a mass vaccination programme, and later took the ground-breaking decision to offer all new students vaccinations.

The university celebrated its Golden Jubilee on 22 January 2002. By this time, Southampton had research income that represented over half of the total income. In recent years a number of new landmark buildings have been added as part of the estates development. New constructions on the main campus include the Jubilee Sports Complex in 2004, the EEE (ECS, Education and Entrance) building in 2007, the new Mountbatten building in 2008 housing the School of Electronics and Computer Science following a fire and the Life Sciences building in 2010. In addition, the Hartley Library and Student Services Centre were both extended and redesigned in 2005 and the Students&#x27; Union was also extended in 2002. Other constructions include the Archaeology building on Avenue Campus in 2006 and the Institute of Development Sciences building at Southampton General Hospital in 2007. The university has also significantly redeveloped its Boldrewood Campus which is home to part of the engineering faculty and to Lloyd&#x27;s Register&#x27;s Global Technology Centre.

The university joined the Science and Engineering South Consortium (SES) on 9 May 2013. The SES was created to pool the collective insights and resources of the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, Imperial College London and University College London to innovate and explore new ideas through collaboration whilst providing efficiencies of scale and shared utilisation of facilities. This is the most powerful cluster of research intensive universities in the UK and the new consortium is to become one of the world&#x27;s leading hubs for science and engineering research.

In 2015, the university started a fundraising campaign to build the Centre for Cancer Immunology based at Southampton General Hospital. At the beginning of 2018, the target amount of £25 million was raised, allowing 150 scientists to move into the building in March 2018. The Centre for Cancer Immunology is the first of its kind in the UK and contains facilities that will hosts clinical trial units and laboratories that will explore the relationship between cancer and the immune system.

==Campuses==
The university has eight educational campuses – five in Southampton, one in Winchester, and two international branches in Malaysia and India. The university operates a science park in Chilworth. The university also owns sports facilities and halls of residences on a variety of other nearby sites.

===Highfield Campus===

The university&#x27;s main campus is located in the residential area of Highfield. Opened on 20 June 1914, the site was initially used as a military hospital during World War I. The campus grew gradually, mainly consisting of detailed red brick buildings (such as the Hartley library and West building of the Students&#x27; Union) designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. In 1956, Sir Basil Spence was commissioned to prepare a masterplan of the campus for the foreseeable future. This included incorporating the University Road, that split the campus in two and the quarry of Sir Sidney Kimber&#x27;s brickyard that itself was split by a stream. Unable to remove the road and the private houses along it, Spence designed many of the buildings facing away from it, using contemporary designs working in concrete, glass and mosaic. During recent decades, new buildings were added that contravened the master plan of Spence, such as the Synthetic Chemistry Building and Mountbatten Building (the latter of which was destroyed by fire in 2005).

In 1991, the Highfield Planning Group was formed within the university under the chairmanship of Tim Holt. This led to the development of new buildings such as the Jubilee Sports Hall, Student Services Building and the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research. In addition, existing buildings, such as the Hartley Library, were extensively renovated and extended. A new masterplan for the Highfield campus was drawn up in 1998 by Rick Mather, who proposed that the University Road should become a tree-lined boulevard backed by white-rendered buildings. He also contributed some of the newer buildings such as the Zepler and Gower Buildings.

===Avenue Campus===

Avenue Campus is currently home to the Faculty of Humanities, with the exception of Music, and is located a short distance away from the main Highfield campus. The site previously housed the Southampton Tramsheds and Richard Taunton&#x27;s College, of which the existing building still stands on the site. It was purchased by the university from Southampton City Council for £2 million in December 1993 so that the university could expand – planning regulations meant that excess land on the Highfield campus couldn&#x27;t be built on and had to be reserved for future car parking spaces. The car parking spaces have now been built. The departments moved onto the campus in 1996. The campus consists of the original Tauntons building from the early 20th century but redeveloped with a glass-fronted courtyard and extension and a new Archaeology building built in 2006 costing £2.7 million.

===Boldrewood Campus===
Boldrewood Campus, located a short distance from the Highfield campus, houses the university&#x27;s new Maritime Centre of Excellence, the Southampton Marine and Maritime Institute and Lloyd&#x27;s Register&#x27;s Group Technology Centre.

The campus was formerly the Biomedical Sciences campus of the university and acted, until 2010, as a non-hospital base for the School of Medicine and home to a research facility for the Biological Sciences. These departments were then relocated to either Southampton General Hospital, the new Life Sciences building at Highfield, or the University of Southampton science park.

===National Oceanography Centre, Southampton===

The National Oceanography Centre, Southampton (NOCS) is located in Southampton Docks three miles south of the main university campus. The campus is home of the university&#x27;s Ocean and Earth Sciences department and is also a campus of the Natural Environment Research Council&#x27;s research institute, the National Oceanography Centre. Five of the National Oceanography Centre&#x27;s research divisions are based on the campus.

Planning of the campus began in 1989 and was completed in 1994 due to cuts and uncertainties whether a national research centre could be successfully integrated with a university. It was opened in 1996 by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The campus was also the base for the NERC purpose-built research vessels RRS &quot;James Cook&quot; and until recently the RRS &quot;Discovery&quot; and the RRS &quot;Charles Darwin&quot;.

===University Hospital Southampton (UHS)===
The university maintains a presence at Southampton General in partnership with the NHS trust operating the hospital. It is home to some operations of the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Health Sciences, although these two faculties have bases on Highfield campus. As a teaching hospital, it is used by a range of undergraduate and postgraduate medical students, research academics and clinicians.

The university&#x27;s involvement began in 1971, when it became the first to house a new school of medicine alongside the universities of Nottingham and Leicester, and currently extends to several operations and specific research centres.

===Winchester School of Art===
The Winchester School of Art, located in central Winchester, houses the university&#x27;s arts and textiles courses that are part of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities. The school itself was established in the 1960s and was integrated into the University of Southampton in 1996. The campus contains the original school buildings from the 1960s, in addition to structures built when the merger occurred and in 1998 when the Textile Conservation Centre moved to the site from Hampton Court Palace. The centre remained with the school until its closure in 2009.

===Malaysia Campus===
The university opened its first international campus in Iskandar Puteri, Malaysia, as the University of Southampton Malaysia in October 2012. Located in the state of Johor near the southwestern tip of Malaysia, the campus is located within EduCity in Iskandar Puteri - a new city comprising universities and institutes of higher education, academia-industry action and R&amp;D centres, as well as student accommodation, shared sports and recreational facilities.

The campus operates courses in engineering, it offers an Engineering foundation year programme and MEng programmes in Aeronautics and Astronautics, Mechanical Engineering and Electrical and Electronic Engineering. All programmes have been approved by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) and the Board of Engineers Malaysia (BEM).

The split campus degree programmes take place in Malaysia for the first two years, with the final two years at Southampton. In 2016, the Malaysia Campus&#x27; first group of students graduated, along with the first PhD graduate.

As part of its expansion plans, the University of Southampton Malaysia has moved into its new 150,000sq ft estate in Eco Botanic City, Iskandar Puteri. The new campus is equipped with open learning spaces, lecture halls, an Aerospace Lab, a Design Studio, Business Experimental Labs, and a 12-terminal Bloomberg Suite. From the initial offerings of four Engineering programmes, UoSM has now grown to offer 20 programmes in the fields of Engineering, Business and Computer Science fields.

Currently, among all the British universities with a campus in Malaysia, UoSM is the only one that is ranked in the world’s top 100 universities and the top UK university in Malaysia.

===India Campus===

In 2024, the university was awarded a licence to establish a new campus in Delhi, India. Programmes are planned to begin in 2025. The university will offer BSc programmes in Computer Science, Business Management, Accounting and Finance, and Economics. MSc programmes will be offered in International Management and Finance.

===Science Park===

The University of Southampton Science Park contains approximately 50 businesses connected to the university. Originally established in 1983 as Chilworth Science Park, named after the manor house that is now a luxury hotel and conference centre, the park houses business incubator units to help these companies. The companies occupying the park range in expertise and fields including oil and gas exploration, pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology and optoelectronics, with three of the twelve successful spin-out companies created since 2000 being floated on London&#x27;s Alternative Investment Market (AIM) with a combined market capitalisation value of £160 million. The park was renamed in 2006.

===Transport links===

To connect the university&#x27;s Southampton campuses, halls of residence, hospitals, and other important features of the city, the university operates the Unilink bus service for the benefit of the students, staff and the general public. The service is currently operated by local bus company Bluestar using the Unilink name. The service consists of four routes. The U1 runs between Southampton Airport and the National Oceanography Centre via Wessex Lane Halls, Highfield campus, Portswood, Southampton City Centre and Southampton Central railway station. The other regular routes, the U2 and the U6, run between the City Centre and Bassett Green and Southampton General Hospital respectively. Introduced in 2023, the U7 and U8 lines connect the Highfield campus to Winchester and Chilworth respectively while the final route, the U9, runs an infrequent service between Southampton General hospital and Townhill Park. Students who live in halls of residence provided by the university receive an annual bus pass, allowing them to use all Unilink services for free.

==Organisation==

=== Governance ===
Responsibility for running the university is held formally by the Chancellor and led at the executive level by the Vice-Chancellor, currently Prof Mark E. Smith. The key bodies in the university governance structure are the Council and Senate.

The Council is the governing body of the university. It is ultimately responsible for the overall planning and management of the university. The council is also responsible for ensuring that the funding made available to the university by the Higher Education Funding Council for England is used as prescribed.

==Academic profile==
===Courses and subjects===
Southampton awards a wide range of academic degrees spanning academic degrees for bachelor&#x27;s in a variety of degrees and master&#x27;s degrees as well as junior doctorates and higher doctorates. The postnominals awarded are the degree abbreviations used commonly among British universities. The university is part of the Engineering Doctorate scheme, for the award of Eng. D. degrees.

Short courses and professional development courses are run by many of the university&#x27;s Academic Schools and Research Centres.

The university works closely with members of the Armed Forces. It provides professional military educators in the British Army to study for a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE). The university also works with the Royal Navy to provide training and qualifications towards Chartered Engineer status.

=== Admissions ===

In terms of average UCAS points of entrants, Southampton ranked 25th in Britain in 2023. The university gives offers of admission to 84.0% of its applicants, the 6th highest amongst the Russell Group.

According to the 2017 &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Good University Guide, approximately 15% of Southampton&#x27;s undergraduates come from independent schools. In the 2016–17 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 72:7:21 of UK:EU:non-EU students respectively with a female to male ratio of 53:47. 60.5% of international students enrolled at the institution are from China, the highest proportion out of all mainstream universities in the UK.

===Rankings and reputation===
In the 2023 international university rankings, Southampton ranked 78th (&quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;) and 108th (&quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;). The 2022 Round University Ranking ranked Southampton 72nd globally, and the 2022 CWTS Leiden Ranking placed Southampton 85th worldwide. The 2021 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks Southampton 97th in the world and 11th in the UK.

Southampton was originally awarded Bronze (&quot;provision is of satisfactory quality&quot;) in the 2017 Teaching Excellence Framework, a government assessment of the quality of undergraduate teaching in universities and other higher education providers in England. The Bronze award was appealed by the university, however it was rejected by the HEFCE in August 2017. In response, the university&#x27;s Vice Chancellor, Christopher Snowden, claimed the exercise was &quot;devoid of any meaningful assessment of teaching&quot; and that &quot;there are serious lessons to be learned if the TEF is to gain public confidence.&quot; Enrollment into the exercise was voluntary and institutions were made aware of the metrics used before agreeing to be assessed by the TEF. In January 2018, the university confirmed that it would re-enter the TEF believing that it would benefit from changed evaluations that would benefit Russell Group universities. In 2018, Southampton was awarded Silver by the Teaching Excellence Framework Panel. In the 2023 TEF assessment, the university maintained its overall Silver rating.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the university at number 1 in the UK for Civil Engineering and Electronic and Electrical Engineering in 2020.

In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF), which assesses the quality of research in UK higher education institutions, Southampton is ranked 17th by GPA and 16th for research power (the grade point average score of a university, multiplied by the full-time equivalent number of researchers submitted).

===Research===
The university conducts research in most academic disciplines and is home to a number of notable research centres. Southampton has leading research centres in a number of disciplines, e.g. music, computer sciences, engineering or management sciences, and houses world-leading research institutions in fields as varied as oceanography and web science.

Within the university there are a number of research institutes and groups that aim to pool resources on a specific research area. Institutes or groups identified by the university of being of significant importance are marked in italics.

====Institute of Sound and Vibration Research====
The Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR), is an acoustical research institute which is part of the University of Southampton. Founded in 1963, it has been awarded a 2006 Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education.

ISVR is divided into four distinct groups of research:
*The Dynamics Group, (specialised in the modelling, measurement and control of structural vibrations).
*The Fluid Dynamics and Acoustics Group (including the Rolls-Royce University Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Noise) specialised in three fields which are aero-acoustics of aircraft engines, ultrasonics and underwater acoustics, noise source imaging and virtual acoustics.
*The Human Sciences Group (including the Hearing and Balance Centre and the Human Factors Research Unit) specialises in the human response to sound and vibration.
*The Signal Processing and Control Group, which specialises in acoustics, dynamics, audiology and human sciences and as a basis for control of sound and vibration.

ISVR offers a number of Undergraduate and Postgraduate degree programmes in acoustical engineering, acoustics &amp; music and audiology.

===EPrints===
The School of Electronics and Computer Science created the first archiving software (EPrints) to publish its research freely available on the Web. This software is used throughout the university and as an archiving system for many different institutions around the world.

===Libraries===
The university has libraries located on each of the academic campuses and in total the collection holds over 1.5 million books and periodicals.

The university&#x27;s primary library is the Hartley Library, located on Highfield campus and first built in 1935 and extended further in 1959 and 2005. The majority of the books and periodicals are held there as well as specialist collections of works such as Ford collection of Parliamentary papers and the European Documentation Centre. In addition, the main library houses the Special Collections and Archives centre, housing more than 6 million manuscripts and a large archive of rare books. Specific collections include the correspondence of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, acquired by the university in 1983, as well as the Broadlands Archive, including the Palmerston and Mountbatten papers. The library also contains 4,500 volumes of Claude Montefiore&#x27;s library on Theology and Judaism, the Ford Parliamentary Papers, Frank Perkins&#x27; collection of books on agriculture, Sir Samuel Gurney-Dixon&#x27;s Dante collection and the James Parkes Library of Jewish/non-Jewish relations. The library also includes six rare editions of the Divina Commedia; the first of these, the Brescia edition of 1487, is the library&#x27;s earliest book.

In addition to the main Hartley Library, there are other libraries based at the university&#x27;s other campuses primarily focused on the subjects studied at that location. As one of the smaller libraries and given its proximity to the Highfield campus, the Avenue Library only houses a collection of key Humanities resources. It does however also hold an extensive film library, many of an international nature. On a larger scale, the libraries at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton General Hospital, Winchester School of Art are more complete and house the majority of the resources and specialist collections on oceanography and earth sciences, healthcare and art and design respectively. The Malaysia campus holds a small collection of reference books but the majority of the resources needed for courses at the campus are available online. Separate from the Hartley Library is the E. J. Richards Engineering Library, which contains further materials for more in-depth study and is freely accessible to Engineering students and staff.

===Arts===
The university&#x27;s main Highfield campus is home to three main arts venues supported and funded by the university and Arts Council England. The Nuffield Theatre opened in 1963 with construction funded by a grant from the Nuffield Foundation of £130,000 (£2,450,000 in 2013). The building was designed by Sir Basil Spence as part of his campus masterplan with additional direction provided by Sir Richard Southern. The theatre consists of a 480-seat auditorium, that also served as the principal lecture theatre at the time of construction, as well as additional lecture theatres and adjacent Kitchen bar. The theatre went into administration in May 2020 and permanent closure was announced in July 2020.

The Turner Sims Concert Hall was added to the art provision in October 1974 following a £30,000 (£460,000 in 2012) donation from Margaret Grassam Sims in 1967. It was made to provide a venue specifically for music following difficulties in gaining space in the Nuffield Theatre and due to acoustical differences with the spaces. The new space has a single auditorium, designed by the university&#x27;s Institute of Sound and Vibration Research with musical performances in mind, with a flat space at the bottom so it could be used for exams.

The final of the three Art Council supported venues on campus is the John Hansard Gallery. The gallery was opened on 22 September 1980 but is housed in a building that previously housed a tidal model of Southampton Water between 1957 and 1978. It took over responsibility from a photographic gallery, a gallery in the Nuffield Theatre and one located on Boldrewood campus. It houses various exhibitions in contemporary art and is due to move to new premises in Guildhall Square in c.2015.

In addition, the western half of Highfield campus contain several 20th-century sculptures by Barbara Hepworth, Justin Knowles, Nick Pope and John Edwards.

==Student life==
===Students&#x27; Union===

The University of Southampton Students&#x27; Union (SUSU) is the university students&#x27; union and has a range of facilities located on the Highfield campus and on the Winchester School of Art campus. At Highfield the union is sited in three buildings opposite the Hartley Library. The main building (Building 42) was built in the 1960s as part of the Basil Spence masterplan. The building was also extensively renovated in 2002 leading to the creation of two new Bars and &#x27;The Cube&#x27; multi-functional space. The West Building dates back to the 1940s in a red brick style, complementing the Hartley Library opposite. This originally held all of the Union&#x27;s activities until the construction of the current Union. At present the building hosts the pub &#x27;The Stags Head&#x27;. The newest building was built during the mid-1990s which includes the union shop and other retail stores.

The union operates four media outlets. Surge Radio, broadcasts from new studios in the main union building over the internet. Internet television station SUSUtv broadcasts a wide range of programmes live and on demand through their website. The student newspaper &quot;Wessex Scene&quot; is published once every three weeks. &quot;The Edge&quot; entertainment magazine began life as an insert of the Wessex Scene in 1995 before growing to become a full publication and online presence in 2011.

===Halls of residence===
The university provides accommodation for all first-year students who require it and places in residences are available for international and MSc students. Accommodation may be catered, self-catered, have en-suite facilities, a sink in the room, or access to communal bathroom facilities. Each hall has a Junior Common Room (JCR) committee that is responsible for the running of social events and representing the residents to the students union and the university via the Students union JCR officer.

The university&#x27;s accommodation exists around two large complexes of halls and some other small halls located around the city. These are:

* Glen Eyre Complex: The complex lies less than half a mile to the north of Highfield Campus and houses approximately 2,000 students. The complex consists of several building sets, designed over the years and arranged either around the central landscaped garden – the oldest buildings, Richard Newitt Courts are separated into blocks A-G and are closest to the Glen Bar, students in these blocks have very small flats (between 4 and 6 to a kitchen with usually more than one bathroom). Old Terrace and New Terrace are close to the site&#x27;s entrance, New Terrace has ensuite rooms. Chancellors&#x27; courts, consisting of Selbourne, Jellicoe and Roll courts are the most modern blocks in the accommodation with Brunei house, the most basic of accommodations, on the outskirts. Located on the south side of Glen Eyre Road on the periphery of the site are Chamberlain Halls, which share most things with the main Glen Eyre site. This site consists of Hartley Grove, South Hill, Beechmount House and the Chamberlain blocks. All Glen Eyre Halls are self-catered at present.
* Wessex Lane Halls: Located in Swaythling approximately one mile east of the Highfield Campus. The complex provides accommodation for over 1,800 students and currently comprises two halls of residence: Montefiore and Connaught. Connaught Halls are fully catered. The complex also features South Stoneham House, a period building constructed in 1708.
* City Gateway Hall: Located in Swaythling one mile north-east of the Highfield Campus at the intersection of two major roads. Opened in September 2015, the landmark building was included in the runners-up list of the 2015 Carbuncle Cup. Featuring a 15-story elliptical tower and two adjoining six-story rectangular accommodation blocks the hall provides accommodation for up to 375 students.
* Mayflower Halls: Located in the city centre within the city&#x27;s &#x27;Cultural Quarter&#x27;, and two minutes&#x27; walk away from Southampton Central railway station. The hall opened at the start of the 2014/2015 academic year, and houses over 1,100 students in a mix of rooms. It includes a gym which is available to both residents and the public.
* Archers Road: Lying two miles south of Highfield and housing 500 students, Archers Road compromises two halls on separate sites. The two halls, Gateley and Romero, are all self-contained and self-catered but share a reception and other community facilities.
* Highfield Halls: Located adjacent to Avenue Campus and half a mile from Highfield campus. Highfield Halls comprises Aubrey and Wolfe houses and both have on-site catering. The site is also used as a University conference facility during the summer months when vacated.
* Gower Building: Gower is mainly used by mature and postgraduate students, located on Highfield campus. Gower contains a small number of self-contained apartments, located above other University amenities.
* Erasmus Park: Located in Winchester, this hall houses around 400 students studying at the Winchester School of Art.
* Riverside Way: Located in Winchester in close proximity to Erasmus Park. This is a private halls site but the university does have an agreement to allocate some students there.

===Healthcare===
The University Health Service is an NHS GP practice located on the main Highfield campus, with over 20,000 patients as of December 2021 working from Building 48 between the Physics &amp; Maths Buildings.

===Sports===
The university&#x27;s Sport and Wellbeing department runs the majority of the sports facilities on campus which are based predominately at two locations: the Jubilee Sports Centre and Wide Lane Sports Ground. The Jubilee Sports Centre, opened in 2004 at a cost of £8.5 million, is located on the Highfield Campus and contains a six-lane 25-metre swimming pool, 160 workstation gym and an eight-court sports hall. Wide Lane meanwhile is located nearby in Eastleigh and was refurbished at cost of £4.3 million in 2007. The complex includes flood-lit synthetic turf and grass pitches, tennis courts, a pavilion and a &#x27;Team Southampton&#x27; Gym. The university also runs facilities at the Avenue Campus, National Oceanography Centre, the Watersports Centre on the River Itchen and at Glen Eyre and Wessex Lane halls while there is another sports hall, squash courts, martial arts studio and bouldering wall located within the Students&#x27; Union.

The university competes in numerous sports in the BUCS South East Conference (after switching from the Western Conference in 2009). A number of elite athletes are supported by the SportsRec through sports bursaries and the UK Government&#x27;s Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme (TASS).

The University Athletic Union was formally established on 29 November 1929, by the University College council. Versions of the union had existed previously to which many clubs such as Cricket, Association Football, Rugby, Boxing, Gymnastics, Tennis and Boat clubs (all formed before the turn of the 20th century) were members.

==== Mustangs Baseball Club ====

The Southampton Mustangs Baseball Club was founded in 1997. In the early years, the club participated in mainly friendly games against other British university baseball teams, as no formal university league was in existence. Starting in 1998, the Mustangs started to host a university baseball tournament – inviting other teams including Oxford, Cambridge, Portsmouth, Royal Holloway, and Norwich. In 2004 the Mustangs entered into the national adult baseball leagues run by the British Baseball Federation (BBF). The club entered in the lowest division, but after a few years of consolidation, the Mustangs have worked their way up from the lower leagues in the BBF to play in the top-tier league of British baseball, the British National Baseball League (NBL), in the 2010 season.

==== National student championships ====
Throughout its history the university has had a number of successful teams in National student championships.

<text>Charles Percy Snow, Baron Snow (15 October 1905 – 1 July 1980) was an English novelist and physical chemist who also served in several important positions in the British Civil Service and briefly in the UK government. He is best known for his series of novels known collectively as &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot;, and for &quot;The Two Cultures&quot;, a 1959 lecture in which he laments the gulf between scientists and &quot;literary intellectuals&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born in Leicester to William Snow, a church organist and choirmaster, and his wife Ada, Charles Snow was the second of four boys, his brothers being Harold, Eric and Philip Snow, and was educated at Alderman Newton&#x27;s School.

In 1923, he passed the intermediate British School Certificate, but remained at Alderman Newton&#x27;s to work as a laboratory assistant for a further two years. In 1925 he began a University of London external degree in science at University College, Leicester, graduating with a first in chemistry in 1927 and an MSc the following year. Upon leaving Leicester, Snow gained a prestigious Keddey-Fletcher-Warr postgraduate studentship worth £200, allowing him to embark on doctoral research at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He received his PhD in physics from Cambridge in 1930, with a thesis on the infrared spectra of simple diatomic molecules.

==Career and research==
In 1930 he became a Fellow of Christ&#x27;s College. After a &quot;Nature&quot; paper on a new method of synthesising Vitamin A turned out to be incorrect, he withdrew from further scientific research.

Snow served in several senior civil service positions: as technical director of the Ministry of Labour from 1940 to 1944, and as a civil service commissioner from 1945 to 1960. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1943 New Year Honours. Snow was among the 2,300 names of prominent persons listed on the Nazis&#x27; Special Search List, of those who were to be arrested on the invasion of Great Britain and turned over to the Gestapo.

In 1944, he was appointed director of scientific personnel for the English Electric Company. Later he became physicist-director. In this capacity he was to employ his former student Eric Eastwood.

In the 1957 New Year Honours he was knighted, having the honour conferred by Queen Elizabeth II on 12 February, and was created a life peer, as Baron Snow, of the City of Leicester, on 29 October 1964. As a politician, Snow was parliamentary secretary in the House of Lords to the Minister of Technology from 1964 to 1966 in the Labour government of Harold Wilson.

Snow married the novelist Pamela Hansford Johnson in 1950; they had one son. Friends included the mathematician G. H. Hardy, for whom he would write a biographical foreword in &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Apology&quot;, the physicist Patrick Blackett, the X-ray crystallographer J. D. Bernal, the cultural historian Jacques Barzun and the polymath George Steiner. At Christ&#x27;s College he tutored H. S. Hoff – later better known as the novelist William Cooper. The two became friends, worked together in the civil service and wrote versions of each other into their novels: Snow was the model for the college dean, Robert, in Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Scenes from Provincial Life&quot; sequence. In 1960, Snow gave the Godkin Lectures at Harvard University, about the clashes between Henry Tizard and F. Lindemann (later Lord Cherwell), both scientific advisors to British governments around the time of the Second World War. The lectures were subsequently published as &quot;Science and Government.&quot; For the academic year 1961 to 1962, Snow and his wife both served as Fellows on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University.

===Literary work===

Snow&#x27;s first novel was a whodunit, &quot;Death under Sail&quot; (1932). In 1975 he wrote a biography of Anthony Trollope. He is better known as the author of a sequence of novels entitled &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot; in which he depicts intellectuals in modern academic and government settings. The best-known of the sequence is &quot;The Masters&quot;. It deals with the internal politics of a Cambridge college as it prepares to elect a new master. With the appeal of an insider&#x27;s view, the novel depicts concerns other than the strictly academic that influence decisions of supposedly objective scholars. &quot;The Masters&quot; and &quot;The New Men&quot; were jointly awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1954. &quot;Corridors of Power&quot; added a phrase to the language of the day. In 1974, Snow&#x27;s novel &quot;In Their Wisdom&quot; was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.

In &quot;The Realists&quot;, an examination of the work of eight novelists – Stendhal, Honoré de Balzac, Charles Dickens, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Benito Pérez Galdós, Henry James and Marcel Proust – Snow makes a robust defence of the realistic novel.

The storyline of his novel &quot;The Search&quot; is referred to in Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27;s &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; and is used to help elicit the criminal&#x27;s motive.

===&quot;The Two Cultures&quot;===
On 7 May 1959, Snow delivered a Rede Lecture called &quot;The Two Cultures&quot;, which provoked &quot;widespread and heated debate&quot;. Subsequently, published as &quot;The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution&quot;, the lecture argued that the breakdown of communication between the &quot;two cultures&quot; of modern society – the sciences and the humanities – was a major hindrance to solving the world&#x27;s problems. In particular, Snow argues that the quality of education in the world is on the decline. He wrote:

::A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: &#x27;Have you read a work of Shakespeare&#x27;s?&#x27;

::I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question – such as, What do you mean by mass, or acceleration, which is the scientific equivalent of saying, &#x27;Can you read?&#x27; – not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language. So the great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their Neolithic ancestors would have had.

The satirists Flanders and Swann used the first part of this quotation as the basis for their short monologue and song, &quot;First and Second Law&quot;.

As delivered in 1959, Snow&#x27;s Rede Lectures specifically condemned the British educational system, as having since the Victorian period over-rewarded the humanities (especially Latin and Greek) at the expense of science education. He believed that in practice this deprived British elites (in politics, administration, and industry) of adequate preparation for managing the modern scientific world. By contrast, Snow said, German and American schools sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled those countries&#x27; rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age. Later discussion of &quot;The Two Cultures&quot; tended to obscure Snow&#x27;s initial focus on differences between British systems (of both schooling and social class) and those of competing countries.

Snow was attacked by F. R. Leavis in his Richmond Lecture of 1962 whose subject was &quot;The Two Cultures&quot;, something that has come to be referred to as &quot;the two cultures controversy&quot;. Although it was seen as a personal attack against Snow, Leavis maintained that he was targeting how public debates worked.

<text>Knightmare is a British children&#x27;s adventure game show, created by Tim Child and broadcast over eight series on CITV from 7 September 1987 to 11 November 1994. The general format of the show consists of a team of four children – one who takes on the game, and three acting as their guide and advisers – attempting to complete a quest within a fantasy medieval environment, traversing a large dungeon and using their wits to overcome puzzles, obstacles and the unusual characters they meet along the journey.

The show is most notable for its use of blue screen chroma key, an idea Child utilised upon seeing it being put to use in weather forecasts at the time the programme began, as well as its use of &#x27;virtual reality&#x27; interactive gameplay on television and the high level of difficulty faced by every team. Broadcast to high viewing figures throughout its original run, it garnered a cult status amongst fans since its final television episode in 1994. It was revived for a one-off special by YouTube in August 2013.

==Format==

Each run of the game involves a team of four children, aged around 11–16, and focuses on the same format. One member takes on the game in person, referred to as the &quot;Dungeoneer&quot;, but are blinded to their surroundings by the &quot;Helmet of Justice&quot; – a headpiece that blocks their field of vision to just around their feet. The other three act as their advisers, guiding them around, giving them advice to solving puzzles, and making notes on the information they receive. Once the Dungeoneer is ready, they are sent off on their quest. In most series, this requires the team to choose which quest they will undertake, whereupon the action takes place within a blue screen chroma key studio used to display a partly computer-generated, partly hand-drawn fantasy dungeon – only the viewers and the advisers can see this. In some cases, filming of a run takes place in real locations, where the viewpoint of these scenes is done to appear to be from that of the Dungeoneer&#x27;s. The rest of the team remains in the main studio fashioned as an antechamber of &quot;Knightmare Castle&quot;, and give instructions and details of a location to the Dungeoneer, much in the same style of text-based computer games which rely on descriptions and commands rather than visuals. An example could be that a room has a key for a locked door within, so the advisers would describe the room to the Dungeoneer and then instruct them to move towards the key, pick it up, and use it on the door to exit the room.

The objective of the game is for the team to complete three levels of a specially made dungeon designed for them; each team faces a new dungeon of a different design, but with similar features recurring during a series. Each level consists of a number of rooms – some with puzzles, obstacles and challenges that have to be overcome – and a selection of inhabitants – some will help out, while others will either hinder the Dungeoneer unless they give them something they require, or attempt to stop them and end their game. In some cases, the team faces more than one exit, and usually must make a choice on which way to go. Every dungeon has a selection of objects, some of which will help to solve puzzles or get past certain inhabitants, while others are decoys. There are also magic spells – a single word that can be used to solve puzzles, overcome hazards and dangerous inhabitants, which require an adviser to spell out the word correctly (e.g. if the spell is Light, then the adviser needs to say L-I-G-H-T).

Each team is required to complete their game within a time-limit, which is represented by an on-screen animated lifeforce meter for the Dungeoneer that depletes over time; the meter is only ever seen by the viewers, but the advisers receive clear hints about its status when they need to take care. Since the amount of time given is not enough, the team must get the Dungeoneer to checkpoints within the dungeon and instruct them to pick up a food item and place it into a knapsack given to them before they begin their run, which fully restores the Dungeoneer&#x27;s lifeforce upon doing so. If the team make mistakes that allows the Dungeoneer to be attacked from minor monsters or hazards, they incur a time penalty which reduces the amount of time they have to complete the game, described as taking &quot;damage&quot; to their lifeforce. If the Dungeoneer runs out of lifeforce, the game is over. The game also ends if the team makes a bad decision and takes a wrong route into a dead end, or if the Dungeoneer is &quot;killed&quot; by an enemy character, monster or trap or &quot;falls&quot; into a pit. The appearance of the lifeforce meter varied during the course of the show&#x27;s history:

* Up until the end of the fifth series, the meter was a computer-animated image of an adventurer wearing a helmet. As lifeforce depletes, pieces of the helmet disappears from the meter, then the skin of the adventurer, and then the skull, until finally the eyes fly past the camera. The background color of the image also changes accordingly – green when healthy (helmet), amber when moderate (skin), and red when critical (skull). A remake of this meter was used in the one-off YouTube remake.
* In the sixth and seventh series, the meter was represented by an animated picture of a walking knight, which loses pieces of its armour over time to reveal a skeleton that eventually collapses.
* In the final series, the meter was represented by a picture of a pie, where the slices reappear once the Dungeoneer puts food in their knapsack.

If the team manages to complete all three levels, they are awarded with their prize, which changed over the years of the show&#x27;s history. Unlike most other children&#x27;s shows, &quot;Knightmare&quot; had no qualms about having a very high difficulty level, and as a result, only eight teams managed to win the game over its eight series. Regardless of whether a team wins or fails, they leave the show once their game is over, and a new team takes their place. This continues until the final episode of the series, whereupon the last team playing in that episode will often always be given an impossible situation which they will fail, in order to allow the series to end. Since each episode is designed to be twenty-five minutes long, should a team&#x27;s run exceed beyond an episode, editing is done to freeze the action towards the end, and then unfreeze at the beginning of the next episode (referred to in the series context as &quot;temporal disruption&quot;). Only twice in the entire series did temporal disruption coincide with the end of a quest (in both series 2 and series 6 where both teams lost). The nature of the rolling game play being condensed into twenty-five minute episodes meant occasionally that the beginning of an episode would feature a team for a very short time before they were eliminated. Conversely, some teams had barely started their quests when temporal disruption occurred.

===Characters===
A Saxon Knight named Treguard of Dunshelm, was the dungeon master and was played by Hugo Myatt for the show&#x27;s eight series. Information about his supposed background can be found in the related literature (see merchandise section). During the show, it was Treguard&#x27;s job to assist the dungeoneer and his team of helpers wherever possible, also explaining a team&#x27;s cause of death whenever they died.

At first, Treguard directed the contestants on his own. However, from Series 4, Treguard had an assistant: Pickle the elf, played by David Learner, and (from Series 7) after Pickle had &quot;gone back to the forest&quot;, Majida, a princess and genie of Arabian descent played by Jackie Sawiris. (Majida originally said her name was &quot;Daughter of the Setting Moon Whose Eyes are Like Daggers in the Hearts of Men Who Ride the Great Caravan of the Sultan&quot;.). Both assistants gave additional support to teams, in particular younger adventurers who may have been nervous at the start of their quests.

During the early series, Treguard was portrayed as a neutral character, most notably between Series 1 and 3. At the start of Episode 14 of Series 3 (when no team had yet completed that series&#x27; dungeon), he went as far as to say &quot;we&#x27;re celebrating an unbeaten record&quot;, apparently siding against the dungeoneers. However, from Series 5 onwards, there was a clear distinction made between &#x27;The Powers that Be&#x27; and &#x27;The Opposition&#x27;, against which Treguard became less neutral, and more inclined to aid the dungeoneers to complete their quest. Aside from Treguard, no other characters were featured throughout the entire run. Only warlock (later wizard and then mage) Hordriss and palace jester Motley would have long runs on the show, both being introduced in season 3 and remaining until the series end.

The formal division of characters between The Powers that Be and The Opposition meant that later series started to feature more advanced story lines which would be hinted at in earlier quests and developed more as the seasons progressed. Examples of this include the alliance between Lord Fear and Aesandre in series 5, which backfires when she freezes the entire dungeon at the end of the season after her powers have been boosted by her ally. Season 6 saw Lord Fear attempt another alliance with Witch Queen Greystagg which she eventually rejected. As a result, Lord Fear summoned a Red Dragon to destroy the dungeon (which Treguard and Pickle ultimately foiled with a lightning rod the final team of that season retrieved), but this plan also failed, leading to the destruction of Mount Fear. In season 7, the enmity between Lord Fear and Greystagg developed further after it was revealed he had destroyed her home. Greystagg helps the final team retrieve a magic hammer to stop a giant troll from destroying Knightmare castle. In the final season, Greystagg had been replaced with the sorceress Maldame and both she and Lord Fear fought for control over an underwater domain called the Great Mire; Lord Fear sent another red dragon to destroy her, but the ultimate outcome of this was unresolved as the final quest ended. Over the course of the series, Treguard became known for his catchphrase &quot;Ooh, nasty!&quot;, regularly used just after a team had died. Intended only as a passing remark, this was originally an ad lib by Myatt. Actors that auditioned for the show were required to demonstrate spontaneity and flexibility. Occasionally, a team&#x27;s actions would require quick thinking by Hugo Myatt and/or the other actors in order for the gameplay to follow the planned path.

In its early series, &quot;Knightmare&quot; lacked a single major antagonist or &#x27;baddie&#x27;. Originally, Treguard was specifically a neutral character, neither on the side of good nor evil. The closest there was to a main villain was Mogdred (portrayed by John Woodnutt), but his primary duty was (according to wizard Merlin in the penultimate episode of Series 2) to &quot;scare you into making a mistake&quot;, though he did kill two dungeoneers, one in Series 2 and another early in Series 4. In Series 5 (1991), however, changes were made. The majority of the characters were split into two sides: the righteous &quot;Powers that Be&quot;, and the villainous &quot;Opposition&quot;, the leader of which was Lord Fear played by Mark Knight. By this time, Treguard&#x27;s stance had now fully evolved into that of a strictly good character.

In 2014, Hugo Myatt lent his &quot;Treguard&quot; voice to the heavy metal band Evil Scarecrow&#x27;s album &quot;Galactic Hunt&quot; for the track &quot;Enter the Knightmare&quot;, whose lyrics are based on the 1980s TV show.

==Production==
&quot;Knightmare&quot; was conceived by Tim Child in 1985, inspired by the two ZX Spectrum games &quot;Atic Atac&quot; and &quot;Dragontorc&quot;. Realising that if a ZX Spectrum could do these types of adventure game, then a television programme could revolutionise the genre, he enlisted the help of artist David Rowe to design realistic looking backgrounds with an airbrush. Borrowing the technique used in weather forecasts, Child devised a large blue room, which was set up in Studio A of Anglia Studios. The advanced computer graphic environments were created by the Travelling Matte Company using a £85,000 Supernova graphics system made by Spaceward Graphics. Travelling Matte was owned by set designer Robert Harris, who had trained at Central Saint Martin&#x27;s in stage design and had been working with John Peyre at BBC TV when &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; started to blend digital images with real world studio scenery. Harris had a background in CGI, having trained in 3D animation at Middlesex Polytechnic under Dr John Vince, and experience in playing out &quot;live&quot; graphics for current affairs programmes like &quot;Newsnight&quot; and &quot;Panorama&quot;. Knightmare required CGI inserts and virtual lighting changes, door reveals and animated monsters in real time, within live action against blue screen using Ultimatte.

Eventually, in early 1986, a 15-minute pilot under the name of &quot;Dungeon Doom&quot; was recorded. Even at this stage it featured Hugo Myatt, the husband of Christine Webber who was a presenter of Anglia&#x27;s regional news programme &quot;About Anglia&quot;. A second 20-minute pilot was filmed on 27 and 28 January 1987, with the name changed to &quot;Knightmare&quot;, and &#x27;lifeforce&#x27; added, an idea borrowed from &quot;Atic Atac&quot;, which also influenced the show in other ways. He recruited Robert Harris, who used a Spaceward computer to design an animation of a knight&#x27;s head that could indicate varying degrees of damage. Child sent this second pilot to the ITV Children&#x27;s Committee in February, who commissioned a series of eight half-hour episodes.

The show was an instant hit, and a second series twice as long as the first was commissioned the next year, closely followed by a third the year after that. By the time this third series finished, Child felt the dungeon format was getting too restrictive, and he needed something new. Because of this, the fourth series saw the introduction of many &#x27;outdoor&#x27; scenes, filmed around places such as medieval castles across the UK, and composited into the blue room using the usual chromakey technique. This series also saw the introduction of the &quot;Eye Shield&quot;, which acted as an &#x27;eye&#x27; for the dungeoneer. Using pre-recorded footage filmed on location, it followed the progress of the dungeoneers as they explored the dungeon. A new onscreen status bar was also introduced, generated by a Commodore Amiga 2000 computer.

At its peak in 1991/1992, &quot;Knightmare&quot; attracted approximately 4–5 million viewers per episode with many episodes being directed by Martin Cairns (at that time a very high figure for a children&#x27;s TV series). By 1993, the year which saw the programme&#x27;s seventh series, it was the most popular non-animated show on CITV. However, changes had recently occurred. Late in the previous year, the ITV Children&#x27;s Committee was replaced by a single Controller of CITV, Dawn Airey. Although she thought well of &quot;Knightmare&quot;, the average audience age of CITV was now 6–10, down from 6–15 in 1985. It was believed the older audience was moving to satellite television and video games, and that programmes for a younger audience were needed. After two meetings, it was agreed that an 8th series of &quot;Knightmare&quot; would go ahead in 1994, but it would be a shorter run (ten episodes instead of fifteen or sixteen) and the remainder of the season&#x27;s timeslot would be taken by &quot;Virtually Impossible&quot;, a new virtual reality show from Broadsword, the same production company as &quot;Knightmare&quot;, and aimed at this younger audience. Shortly after this decision was made, Airey left for Channel 4, and was replaced as Controller by Vanessa Chapman.

Despite the diminishing older audience, &quot;Knightmare&quot;″s eighth series performed well, and gained a higher audience than &quot;Virtually Impossible&quot; did later that autumn. Changes introduced in this series saw a return to the dungeon format of Series 1–3, albeit now completely computer-generated, and a new piece of dungeoneering equipment was added: the wand &quot;Reach&quot;. This allowed dungeoneers to push, touch, and open things from a distance. At this point, there was still hope that &quot;Knightmare&quot; would return for a ninth series in 1995: a postal address for future contestants was displayed on screen after the end of the final episode. The chances of the eighth series being the last were also strong, however, and so the series ended on an ambiguous note.

In the event, &quot;Knightmare&quot; was &#x27;rested&#x27; for the foreseeable future, partly due to the declining older audience, and partly because Tim Child felt that while &quot;Knightmare&quot; should employ high-quality virtual reality in order to remain a cutting-edge show, such technology was not affordable at the time.

===Overseas versions===
Two other versions of &quot;Knightmare&quot; were also made: one in France (&quot;Le Chevalier Du Labyrinthe&quot;), which ran from 19 September 1990 to 31 August 1991, and the other in Spain (&quot;El Rescate Del Talisman&quot;) which ran from 29 May 1991 to 1994. Both versions were sponsored by Sega. One of the primary differences with both international versions was that there was no rolling gameplay (i.e. each team/quest was completed in one episode) and prizes were awarded at the end of each episode.

In 1992, Tim Child and Broadsword attempted to sell the series to American broadcasters with a pilot called Lords of the Game. This pilot used characters, settings and the cast from series 6 excluding Hugo Myatt who was replaced with an American actor. There was little interest in the series, primarily due to the potential technical issues with using bluescreen/chromakey and an NTSC recording setup.

===Merchandise===
A number of items of &quot;Knightmare&quot; merchandise were produced over the show&#x27;s run, including seven books written by Dave Morris:

* Knightmare: Can you beat the challenge? (, 1988)
* The Labyrinths of Fear (, 1989)
* Fortress of Assassins (, 1990)
* The Sorcerer&#x27;s Isle (, 1991)
* The Forbidden Gate (, 1992)
* The Dragon&#x27;s Lair (, 1993)
* Lord Fear&#x27;s Domain (, 1994)

The first of these, &quot;Knightmare&quot;, told the story of how Treguard came to inhabit Knightmare Castle, revealed once to have been Dunshelm Castle, which Treguard owned by birthright. The next four books were intended for older readers, and took the format of half-fiction, half-interactive story. In these, the first half of the book was a novelette about one of Treguard&#x27;s adventures, serving as a lead-in to the second half which comprised numbered sections where the reader directed the narrative, similar to the Choose Your Own Adventure books. The next two books retained the interactive format, but were aimed at a younger audience. Throughout the interactive portions of the books, the reader had to keep track of Life Force and objects collected, and some books had additional statistics or special skills to monitor. Finally, &quot;Lord Fear&#x27;s Domain&quot; was a puzzle book.

There were also two &quot;Knightmare&quot; computer games released: the first was in 1987, released on the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, and Commodore 64; and the second Knightmare game in 1991, released on the Amiga and Atari ST. A PC version was proposed for 1995, but the plan was abandoned when the series finished. The latter game was an RPG similar to the Dungeon Master and Eye Of The Beholder games which, whilst well received at the time, had very little to do with the TV series besides the fantasy setting.

A &quot;Knightmare&quot; board game was also released in 1992, by MB Games.

==Transmissions==
===Repeats===
After &quot;Knightmare&quot; ended on ITV, it was quickly picked up by The Sci-Fi Channel, which broadcast all eight series starting from the channel&#x27;s launch in November 1995. However, ratings were low, perhaps exacerbated by the satellite sharing that meant UK fans were unable to receive the Sci Fi Channel at the times when the show was being broadcast. (Cable television was also relatively uncommon in the UK at this time, and completely unavailable in some areas, further limiting the show&#x27;s existing fanbase.) Sci-Fi&#x27;s contract ran out on 31 October 1998. &quot;Knightmare&quot;&#x27;s only appearances on television after that were as clips in &quot;40 Years of Anglia&quot; in 1999, and Channel 4&#x27;s 100 Greatest Kids&#x27; TV Shows in 2001, where it came 16th, the highest position on the list for a game show.

In the United States, Series 5 and 6 were shown for a short time on local Long Island, New York independent station WLNY.

In December 2002, the UK satellite channel Challenge held a group of programmes called the &quot;Christmas Cult Selection&quot;, featuring a group of classic game shows from the 1960s (&quot;The Golden Shot&quot;) right through to the 1980s. &quot;Knightmare&quot; was included in this, and the repeats started on 23 December 2002, with Series 3, Episode 1 preceded by a short 2.5-minute documentary featuring Tim Child and Hugo Myatt. Just over a week later, &quot;Knightmare&quot; went on to reach first place in an Internet poll held by Challenge, asking viewers to decide the best show out of the Cult Selection.

Reasonable ratings, combined with the high fanbase, ensured that the other seven series went on to be bought and shown over the next two years. It took until 8 July 2004 for all the episodes to be shown, when Episode 16 of Series 2 was broadcast 563 days after the repeats started. &quot;Knightmare&quot; continued to run on Challenge until 31 March 2007, when the rights to the series expired. By this time, only five of the eight series were still being repeated, as the rights to Series 3 expired at the end of 2004, Series 4 on 31 May 2006, and Series 5 on 30 September 2006, the latter two following a final showing of those series.

On 5 and 6 January 2013, the final two episodes from Series 7 were shown on the CITV channel as part of its &#x27;Old Skool Weekend&#x27;, which celebrated 30 years of ITV&#x27;s programming block for children. According to Radio Times, Knightmare was the second most watched programme during the &#x27;Old Skool Weekend&#x27;, only being beaten by Fun House.

On 22 April 2013, Challenge announced that they have re-acquired the first two series of Knightmare. The re-run began its transmission on 10 May 2013 at 10:30pm, shown as part of their &#x27;Late Zone&#x27; strand. These repeats now have the ITV Studios logo at the end rather than the Anglia logo.

On 29 June 2015, Challenge announced that they have also re-acquired the third and fourth series. The re-run started airing on 25 October 2015 at 10:00am.

==Further developments==
===Video game===
Activision released a video game adaptation.

===&quot;Knightmare VR&quot;===
On 25 November 2002, only 6 days after the Challenge repeats were confirmed, it was announced that a reformat of &quot;Knightmare&quot; was to be undertaken by Televirtual, founded by Tim Child. Known as &quot;Knightmare VR&quot;, this would use avatar technology to place the dungeoneer in a full 3D computer generated world. A £40,000 National Lottery grant for the programme was awarded in July 2003.

In 2004, test images and clips continued to appear on the Televirtual website and finally on 17 August 2004, the full 13-minute pilot was posted on the Internet.

The VR pilot kept a lot of the elements that appeared in the original show such as Wall Monsters, Clue Rooms and the dark and grimy dungeon setting. Original Knightmare actors Hugo Myatt and Mark Knight reprised their roles as Treguard and Lord Fear respectively, while several additional actors (including Nick Collett and Tim Child himself) were introduced to the cast.

The pilot introduced some fresh elements, including a new main host named Garstang, who was an orc. Treguard was now relegated to an avatar head who would sometimes appear to give the dungeoneer advice. The dungeoneer and all the in-dungeon characters were now fully computer generated, along with the rooms themselves, which meant that the dungeoneer could explore much larger and grander surroundings than previously seen. All of the rooms could now be seen more thoroughly from different camera angles, an element which the original programme was unable to do easily due to the limits of its technology.

The Helmet of Justice was no longer used, enabling the dungeoneer to now clearly see their surroundings. As a result of this, only one advisor was now needed, instead of three.

Reactions to the pilot were mixed, with some saying the lack of a Helmet of Justice and the associated &quot;guiding&quot; element meant most of the essence of the original show was lost. The new theme was dismissed by some as being overly &quot;cheesy&quot; and unrelated to the dark sense of the programme. On 10 May 2005, it was announced that the project was to be shelved, with Child saying he had decided &quot;Knightmare&quot; would work best under a mixture of virtual reality and the original format.

In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in April 2013, Child said that although &quot;(t)here will always be hardcore fans clamouring for (&quot;Knightmare&quot;΄s) return; I think it&#x27;s best to let it languish in its own deep, dark dungeon&quot;.

===YouTube===
In December 2012, lifelong Knightmare fan James Aukett commemorated 25 years since the first ever episode was shown with a documentary which featured interviews with Hugo Myatt, Tim Child, artist David Rowe (who illustrated the dungeon backgrounds for the earlier series) and various other actors and contestants who participated in Knightmare during the course of the show&#x27;s eight series.

In August 2013, a one-off special edition of Knightmare was produced for YouTube&#x27;s &quot;Geek Week&quot; event, directed and produced by Tim Child and featuring three original cast members – Hugo Myatt (Treguard), Mark Knight (Lord Fear) and Cliff Barry (Lissard), plus &quot;Knightmare VR&quot; actor Nick Collett and actresses Isy Suttie and Jessie Cave playing new roles. The team of dungeoneers were YouTube content creators Daniel Howell, Phil Lester, Emma Blackery and Stuart Ashen. Filming took place in Norwich at the original Anglia television studios.

===Knightmare Live===
A theatrical version of Knightmare was performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe from 23 July to 15 August 2013. It opened to rave reviews and was performed in London in 2013 and 2016. The show is produced by Objective Talent Management and stars Paul Flannery, Tom Bell and Amee Smith.

===Convention===
In March 2014, a group comprising the cast and crew of &quot;Knightmare&quot; and the website knightmare.com launched a successful crowdfunding campaign to raise money to run a &quot;Knightmare&quot; convention in the studios in Norwich where &quot;Knightmare&quot; was originally filmed. The convention took place at EPIC Studios in Norwich on 9–11 May 2014.

The convention allowed visitors to play a room of the &quot;Knightmare&quot; dungeon using the same technology used in the show, as well as to meet with some of the original cast. A copy of the American pilot Lord of the Game was also shown with an introduction by Tim Child.

<text>Lansquenet is a banking game played with cards, named after the French spelling of the German word Landsknecht (&#x27;servant of the land or country&#x27;), which refers to 15th- and 16th-century German mercenary foot soldiers; the lansquenet drum is a type of field drum used by these soldiers. It is recorded as early as 1534 by François Rabelais in &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;.

== Cards ==
Lansquenet is played with an Italian pack of 40 cards.

== Play ==

The dealer or banker stakes a certain sum, and this must be met by the nearest to the dealer first, and so on. When the stake is met, the dealer turns up one card and lays it to his right, for the table or the players, and another card in front of himself for the bank. He then keeps on turning up cards (while keeping the first two cards visible), until a card turns up with a value matching either of the first two cards. For instance, if the five of diamonds has been laid down for the bank, then any other five, regardless of suit, constitutes a win for the banker. If the table&#x27;s card is matched first, he loses, and the next player on the left becomes banker and proceeds in the same way.

When the dealer&#x27;s card turns up, he may take the stake and pass the bank; or he may allow the stake to remain, whereupon it becomes doubled if met. He can continue thus (doubling on each win) as long as the cards turn up in his favour (i.e., before the table&#x27;s card appears, causing the banker to lose only his original stake) – having the option at any moment of giving up the bank and retiring for that time. If he does that, the player to whom he passes the bank has the option of continuing it at the same amount at which it was left. The pool may be re-made up by contributions of all the players in certain proportions (now including the previous bank player). The terms used respecting the standing of the stake are &quot;I&#x27;ll see&quot; (&quot;à moi le tout&quot;) and &quot;Je tiens&quot;. When &quot;jumelle&quot; (twins), or the turning up of similar cards on both sides, occurs, then the dealer takes half the stake.

Robert-Houdin explained a mechanism by which a card sharp could cheat at lansquenet, by palming and then placing atop the deck a packet of cards in prepared order.

== Cultural references ==
Lansquenet is listed by Francois Rabelais in &quot;Gargantua&quot; in 1534. The game is played by Porthos in the Alexandre Dumas novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. Lansquenet is also played by D&#x27;Artagnan in the Dumas novel &quot;Twenty Years After&quot;. Lucien Debray imagines Baroness Danglers might occupy herself with lansquenet in the Dumas novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. Lansquenet is played by various characters in the Pierre Choderlos de Laclos novel &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;.

A game in &quot;Le financier et le savetier&quot; (1856) by Jacques Offenbach enables the cobbler to win the hand of the financier&#x27;s daughter. It is mentioned briefly in the novel &quot;A Rebours&quot; by Joris-Karl Huysmans, and in the novel &quot;The General in his Labyrinth&quot; by Gabriel García Márquez. Lansquenet is played by two soldiers on a stone bench under an enclosed poplar as mentioned in Kinbote&#x27;s note to line 130 in &quot;Pale Fire&quot; by Vladimir Nabokov, and is also played by Fatima and her family in Charles Perrault&#x27;s Bluebeard.

&quot;Lansquenet-sous-Tannes&quot; is a fictional village in Joanne Harris&#x27; novel &quot;Chocolat&quot;. It is mentioned in &quot;The Prague Cemetery&quot; by Umberto Eco. The game is mentioned in several of Georgette Heyer&#x27;s historical novels. For example, in Chapter Thirteen of &quot;The Masqueraders&quot;, Lansquenet is played in the novel &quot;The Luck of Barry Lyndon&quot; by William Makepeace Thackeray. Lanquenet is played by the protagonist in the 2022 video game &quot;Pentiment&quot;.

<text>Crowland (modern usage) or Croyland (medieval era name and the one still in ecclesiastical use; cf. ) is a town and civil parish in the South Holland district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated between Peterborough and Spalding. Crowland contains two sites of historical interest, Crowland Abbey and Trinity Bridge.

==History==

The town&#x27;s two historical points of interest are the ruined medieval Crowland Abbey and the 14th-century three-sided bridge, Trinity Bridge, which stands at its central point and used to be the confluence of three streams.

In about 701, a monk named Guthlac came to what was then an island in the Fens to live the life of a hermit. Following in Guthlac&#x27;s footsteps, a monastic community came into being here, which was dedicated to Saint Mary the Virgin, Saint Bartholomew and Saint Guthlac in the eighth century.

The place-name &#x27;Crowland&#x27; is first attested circa 745 AD in the &quot;Vita S. Guthlaci auctore Felice&quot;, reprinted in the &quot;Memorials of Saint Guthlac&quot; published in Wisbech in 1881. Here the name appears as &quot;Cruglond&quot;, &quot;Crugland&quot;, &quot;Cruuulond&quot; and &quot;Cruwland&quot;. It appears as &quot;Croiland&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. The word &quot;cruw&quot; is thought to mean a bend, and to refer to the bend in the River Welland at Crowland, which was more pronounced before the draining of the fens.

The town of Crowland grew up round the abbey. By a charter dated 716, Æthelbald of Mercia granted the isle of Crowland, free from all secular services, to the abbey with a gift of money, and leave to build and enclose the town. The charter&#x27;s privileges were confirmed by numerous other royal charters extending over a period of nearly 800 years. Under Abbot Ægelric the fens were tilled, the monastery grew rich, and the town increased in size, enormous tracts of land being held by the abbey at the Domesday Survey.

The &quot;Croyland Chronicle&quot; (1144–1486), an important source for medieval historians, is believed to be the work of some of the monastery&#x27;s inhabitants.

The town was nearly destroyed by fire (1469–1476), but the abbey tenants were given money to rebuild it. By virtue of his office the abbot had a seat in parliament, but the town was never a parliamentary borough. Abbot Ralph Mershe in 1257 obtained a grant of a market every Wednesday, confirmed by Henry IV in 1421, but it was afterwards moved to Thorney. The annual fair of St Bartholomew, which originally lasted twelve days, was first mentioned in Henry III&#x27;s confirmatory charter of 1227. The dissolution of the monastery in 1539 was fatal to the progress of the town, and it rapidly sank into the position of an unimportant village. The abbey lands were granted by Edward VI to Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln, from whose family they passed in 1671 to the Orby family.

In 1642, near the start of the English Civil War, the remains of the abbey were fortified and garrisoned by Royalists under Governor Thomas Stiles. After a short siege it was taken by Parliamentarian forces under the command of Oliver Cromwell in May 1643.

The surrounding agricultural area suffered from extensive flooding in 1947 as the River Welland and the surrounding drain network was overwhelmed with meltwater. A flood defence bank, West Bank, still exists, forming the north-west perimeter of the village and eastern flank of the River Welland&#x27;s flood plain.

The Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway crossed the north-east part of the parish until the 1980s. It passed near De Key&#x27;s Farm to the east and Martin&#x27;s Farm to the north. Postland railway station was near Postland House.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the name of Crowland and Deeping St Nicholas exists. This ward has a total population taken at the 2011 census of 6,172.

==Geography==
Crowland is nearer to the outskirts of Peterborough than Spalding, and (similar to other settlements of the Welland) is less than north of the boundary with the City of Peterborough. The main road is the A16, which provides connections with Spalding to the north and Peterborough to the south (via the A47). The east-west B1166 connects with Deeping St. James, the north side of the Welland to the west and Holbeach Drove to the east, and Thorney is accessed via the B1040 to the south-east.

From 1894 the parish, being the only part of the Peterborough Rural Sanitary District in Lincolnshire, formed its own Crowland Rural District. This was merged into Spalding Rural District under a County Review Order in the 1930s. It has formed part of the South Holland district since April 1974.

Crowland falls within the drainage area of the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board.

===Nature reserve===
The Crowland Ponds Nature Reserve is north of the town, next to the west side of the Welland.

==Education==
The town currently has one school, South View Primary, which has moved from its former home on Reform Street to the much larger former St Guthlac School site on Postland Road in September 2014.

Crowland&#x27;s former secondary school was named The St Guthlac School after the abbey&#x27;s founder. It was situated at the junction of the B1166 and B1040. Lincolnshire Country Council made the decision at the begin of July 2011 that The St Guthlac School would close as part of the creation of the University Academy Holbeach, to be situated on the site of the former George Farmer Technology and Language College in Holbeach.

==Media==
Crowland receives its television signals from various transmitters: Sandy Heath (BBC East/ITV Anglia), Waltham (BBC East Midlands/ITV Central), and Belmont (BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire/ITV Yorkshire).

The town is served by both BBC Radio Lincolnshire and BBC Radio Cambridgeshire. Other radio stations including Smooth East Midlands (formerly Connect FM) and Kiss. The area is also one of the few in Lincolnshire to be covered by a local DAB multiplex, NOW Peterborough.

Local newspaper is the &quot;Peterborough Telegraph&quot; (formerly &quot;Peterborough Citizen&quot;).

<doc id="98085" wikidata="Q3059474" url="?curid=98085" title="Euchre">
<text>Euchre or eucre ( ) is a trick-taking card game commonly played in Australia, Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand, Upstate New York, and the Midwestern United States. It is played with a deck of 24, 25, 28, or 32 standard playing cards. There are normally four players, two on each team, although there are variations for two to nine players.

Euchre emerged in the United States in the early 19th century. There are several theories regarding its origin, but the most likely is that it is derived from an old Alsatian game called &quot;Jucker&quot; or &quot;Juckerspiel&quot;. Euchre was responsible for introducing the joker into the modern deck of cards, first appearing in Euchre packs in the 1850s.

Euchre has a large number of variants and has been described as &quot;an excellent social game&quot;.

==Origins and popularity==

&quot;Eucre&quot; is briefly mentioned as early as 1810, being played in a gaming house alongside all fours, loo, cribbage, and whist. In 1829, &quot;uker&quot; was being played with &quot;bowers&quot; on a steamboat in the American Midwest. The earliest written rules appeared in 1844.

The mode of play and terminology of Euchre have resulted in several theories which suggest that it has an origin in Spanish Trionfo, French Ecarté or Triomphe, or Alsatian Jucker. An early American theory was that Euchre was brought into the United States by the German settlers of Pennsylvania, and from that region it was disseminated throughout the nation. The 1864 edition of &quot;The American Hoyle&quot; disputes its alleged German heritage, tracing the game&#x27;s origin to Pennsylvania itself in the 1820s. It goes on to surmise that a &quot;rich German farmer&#x27;s daughter&quot; had visited Philadelphia and carried home a confused memory of Écarté, which then developed into Euchre.

Yet another theory is that Euchre may have been introduced to America by immigrants from the counties of Cornwall or Devon in southwest England, where it remains a hugely popular game. Euchre was introduced into Devon in turn by French prisoners of The Napoleonic Wars, imprisoned in Dartmoor Prison between 1805 and 1816. American prisoners were also housed there after the War of 1812.

Card game historian David Parlett believes that Euchre is derived from an eighteenth-century Alsatian card game named Jucker or Juckerspiel, pronounced &quot;yooker&quot;. Clues to a possible German origin are the names of the trump Jacks. &quot;Bower&quot; is phonetically identical with the German word &quot;Bauer&quot; which normally means farmer, but also refers to the Jack in playing cards. Another word probably derived from German is &quot;march&quot;, which is the literal translation of &quot;Marsch&quot;, itself an abbreviation of &quot;Durchmarsch&quot; and the German for a slam in many card games. 

Other words or phrases that reflect a German origin are: &quot;maker&quot; from &quot;Macher&quot;, short for &quot;Spielmacher&quot; i.e. &quot;game maker&quot;, the person who determines the type of game to be played; &quot;euchred&quot; from &quot;gejuckert&quot;; &quot;having a dog from every county&quot; from &quot;aus jedem Dorf ein Köter&quot; i.e. &quot;a mongrel from every village&quot;, a common expression in German card games; &quot;cards away&quot; from &quot;Karten weg&quot; or &quot;Kart&#x27; ab&quot;, an expression in games from the Palatinate/Saarland region for the same announcement, &quot;bridge&quot; possibly from &quot;Pritsche&quot;, a plank bed, hence a place of safety.

The earliest known treatise is a 1839 lost book called &quot;Game of Euchre and Its Laws&quot;, by an unknown author. The earliest surviving rules appeared in 1844, in which there is no Joker. 32 cards are used. The &quot;Right Bower&quot;, the trump Jack, is the &quot;commanding card&quot; with the &quot;Left Bower&quot;, the Jack of the same color, as the second-highest card. According to Parlett, the Joker was added to a 32-card pack in the 1850s specifically for the game of Euchre and is first mentioned in a set of rules in 1868 where it turns out to be a blank specimen card not intended for actual play. 

This gave rise to a variant called &quot;Euchre with the Joker&quot; in which the blank card ranked above all the rest. It must have been in use even earlier, since the term &quot;Best Bower&quot; appears in a satirical 1861 piece about the American Civil War. Later, the Joker was embellished with a motif and specifically intended for use as the top trump. It was later transferred to the game of Poker and initially called the Mistigris.

In the late 19th century, Euchre was regarded as the national card game of the United States. It has since declined in popularity, although it retains a strong following in regions such as the Midwestern United States. Euchre has also been described as Canada&#x27;s national card game. With the rise of 20th century games such as Contract Bridge and Spades, Euchre has declined in popularity, though it is still played as a social game in the US Midwest, the Canadian province of Ontario, Australia, New Zealand, and Great Britain, especially Cornwall.

== Earliest rules (1844) ==
The earliest surviving rules were published in America by Thomas Mathews in his 1844 work, &quot;The Whist Player&#x27;s Hand-book&quot;, in which a four-hand version of Euchre is described right at the end. The following is a summary:

=== Players and cards ===
Euchre is played by two to nine people, but most often by four. A 32-card French-suited Piquet pack is used and cards rank in the trump suit as follows: Right Bower (trump knave), Left Bower (knave of same color), A &gt; K &gt; Q &gt; 10 &gt; 9 &gt; 8 &gt; 7. The side suits rank in their natural order. Deal and play are clockwise.

=== Deal ===
The pack is shuffled and four cards distributed. The players with two higher cards become partners and play the other two. The dealer deals five cards each in packets of two and three and turns the next for trump. 

=== Making trump ===
The eldest hand (to the left of the dealer) opens the auction and may either &#x27;order it up&#x27; (= accept the turnup as trump) or &#x27;turn it down&#x27; (= pass), in which case the next player in turn has the same options and so on. The team that order it up are the &#x27;makers&#x27;. If all pass, the dealer does not exchange, and another round of bidding begins with eldest who may make trump of any other suit. If all pass again and dealer does not want to make trump, the cards are thrown in and the next dealer deals. 

If anyone orders up, the dealer picks up the upcard and discards a card in return. The dealer&#x27;s partner may bid &quot;assist&quot;, in which case the dealer takes up trump and they become the makers. A player confident of taking 5 tricks single-handed may say &quot;cards away&quot; to the partner and play alone against the opponents.

=== Play ===
The eldest leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if able; otherwise may play any card. The highest trump takes the trick or the highest card of the led suit if no trumps were played. The trick winner leads to the next trick.

=== Winning ===
The makers must take at least 3 tricks to win and score 1 point. Otherwise they are &quot;euchred&quot;, i.e. have lost and their opponents score 2 points. Winning all 5 tricks is a march which earns 2 points. Announcing &quot;cards away&quot; and winning all 5 tricks alone scores 4 points. Points are tallied using the unused Deuce and Trey cards, or counters. Game is 5 points.

=== Terminology ===
The following terms were used by Mathews. Many continue to be used today:

* &quot;Bridge&quot;. The leading team are &quot;at the bridge&quot; when 1 point from winning and the trailing team are 4 points away, and could win by going alone.
* &quot;Cards Away&quot;. Now called &quot;going alone&quot;. To play alone against the two defenders.
* &quot;Dutching&quot;. When the dealer has turned down the upcard, to entrump the suit of the same colour.
* &quot;Euchre&quot;. When the makers fail to take at least 3 tricks they are &quot;euchred&quot;.
* &quot;March&quot;. Taking all tricks, which scores 2 points.
* &quot;Order up&quot;. As a non-dealer, to accept the turnup as trump.
* &quot;Turn down&quot;. As dealer, after everyone else has passed, to reject the turnup.

== British rules ==
In Britain, euchre is played in southwestern England, especially Cornwall, Devon and Guernsey, as well as in coastal East Anglia. A key feature is that a joker (or sometimes the 2), called the &quot;Benny&quot;, is the highest trump. The following is a summary of modern British rules by John McLeod, supplemented by other sources where indicated.

=== Players and cards ===
Euchre is a four-player game using a pack of 25 cards with a joker and four suits comprising AKQJT9. Card ranking is as per the 1844 rules with the exception that the top trump is the &quot;Benny&quot; or &quot;Best Bower&quot; represented by the joker or 2. Deal and play are clockwise.

=== Deal ===
The first dealer can be chosen by any random method. The dealer shuffles and deals each player a packet of 2 or 3 cards in any order and then a second packet making the hands up to 5 cards. The next card is turned as a potential trump. Often, it is customary to offer a cut of the deck to the player on the dealer&#x27;s right before passing out the cards.

=== Making trump ===
The process of making trump is as follows:
* Eldest opens by passing or saying &quot;I order it up&quot; (or just &quot;up&quot;)
* If eldest passes, dealer&#x27;s partner may pass or say &quot;I turn it down&quot;
* If the first two pass, third hand may pass or order it up
* If the first three pass, the dealer may say &quot;I take it up&quot; and pick up the upcard, or pass by saying &quot;over&quot; and turning it face down.
* The option is now given to select any other suit to be trump, and this again is chosen or passed on by each player in turn.
* If no player elects to make trump the second time round, the hand is either discarded and the game continues with the next dealer, or the fourth player is forced to choose a trump suit, depending on rule set.
As soon as someone makes trump (instead of passing) that player&#x27;s team become the makers and their opponents are the defenders. Should either opponent order it up or the dealer take it up, the suit of the upcard becomes trump. The dealer picks it up and discards a card face down. 

Note that the dealer&#x27;s partner cannot make trumps and play with the dealer, but can only pass or play alone by turning it down. This does not apply to the second choice in which the player may choose any suit. If the upcard is the Benny, the dealer must announce trumps before picking up their own hand cards and the dealer&#x27;s team are the makers (a &quot;blind shout&quot;).

=== Going alone ===
Before the first trick any player may announce they are going &quot;alone&quot;, whereupon the partner of the lone player puts their cards face down on the table and drops out of that hand. A maker and a defender may both go alone, in which case it is one against one. The side going alone gains 4 points if it gets a &quot;clean sweep&quot;; if it only wins 3, it gains 2 points.

=== Play and scoring ===
Play and scoring are as in the 1844 rules, except that:
* If a maker is going alone, an active defender to the left of the loner leads; otherwise the remaining opponent leads
* If a defender plays alone and wins ≥ 3 tricks, the defenders score 4 points.
* Score is kept using a spare 5 and 6 card instead of a deuce and trey.
* Game is 11 points.

=== British terminology ===
* &quot;Bump&quot;. Knock the cards instead of cutting.
* &quot;Dockyard play&quot; or &quot;Playing policemen&quot;. When dealer&#x27;s opponents have good cards but do not order up in the hope of euchring the makers.
* &quot;Have an eye&quot;. Have at least 1 point.
* &quot;Shout&quot;. Bid. A player going alone makes a &quot;lone shout&quot;.
* &quot;Sleeping hand&quot;. The cards left face down.
* &quot;Trump caller&quot;. Player who makes trump.
* &quot;Whitewashed.&quot; Beaten without scoring e.g. 11-0.

=== Rule variations ===
The following rule variations are recorded:
* Game may be any other agreed number of points e.g. 10 or 21.
* Dealer&#x27;s partner may play with a partner by ordering up and is not forced to go alone.
* Instead of cutting, the cutter may tap or bump the cards.
* At the start of a session, cards are dealt around and the player who receives the first jack, deals first.
* Euchring a lone trump caller earns 4 points.
* The deal is a packet of 3 cards each first, then a packet of two.
* Dealer is always the first to &quot;shout&quot; i.e. open the bidding. In this scenario, the dealer must pick up the joker on a &quot;blind shout&quot; and discards a card as normal.

== North American rules ==
Euchre is played slightly differently in North America and there are numerous variations. The following account is a summary of the typical rules for the four-hand game.

=== Players and cards ===
Four players play in two teams, the partners sitting opposite one another. A 24-card pack is used with cards ranking as before with a right bower and left bower as the top two cards of the trump suit. A pack of 32 cards (AKQJ10987) or 28 cards (no 7s) may also be used, but 24 cards is the standard.

=== Deal ===
Deal and play are clockwise. The face-down pack is spread on the table and players draw a card each. The players with the two lowest cards play together against the others and the player with the lowest card deals first. For this purpose only, suits are irrelevant, aces rank low and jacks rank immediately below the queens. The dealer then shuffles the pack and offers it to the right for cutting.

Five cards are dealt in two rounds. In the first, the dealer may deal either 2 or 3 cards each, in turn and in clockwise order beginning with the eldest hand. This is followed by a second round to bring each player&#x27;s hand to 5 cards. Whichever system is used initially, it must not subsequently be changed. The remaining four cards, called the &quot;kitty&quot;, are placed face down in the center of the table and its top card flipped.

=== Making trump ===
The eldest hand opens the bidding by passing (saying &quot;pass&quot;) or accepting the suit of the upcard as trump by saying: &quot;I order it up&quot; (or &quot;pick it up&quot;). If the eldest passes, the second hand, the dealer&#x27;s partner, may pass or accept by saying: &quot;I assist&quot; (or &quot;I&#x27;ll help you&quot;). If the second hand passes, the third hand may pass or accept. If the first three pass, the dealer may accept the turnup by discarding a card (called &quot;taking it up&quot;) or turn it down by placing the upcard, face up, half under the kitty (called &quot;turning it down&quot;). 

If the dealer acquires the top card, either by being ordered to pick it up or choosing to pick it up, it becomes part of the dealer&#x27;s hand. It is left in place until played, and the dealer discards a card to the bottom of the kitty, face down. If no one orders up the top card and the dealer chooses not to take it up, each player is then given the opportunity, in turn, to pass again or call a different suit as trump. If no trump is selected, the hand is discarded and the deal passes to the left.

When trumps are chosen, the trump jack becomes the top card or right bower. The jack of the same color is the second-highest trump, known as the left bower. &quot;Example:&quot; Spades are trump. In this case, the trump cards rank as follows (highest first):
: (right bower), (left bower), , , , , 

The effectively becomes a spade during the playing of this hand. This expands the suit of spades to the seven cards above and reduces the suit of clubs by one card, its jack being seconded to the trump suit. Once the hand is over, the ceases to be a spade and becomes a club again unless spades are again named as trump during a subsequent hand.

=== Going alone ===
A player who fixes the trump suit may announce &quot;alone&quot; and play without the aid of a partner. The partner&#x27;s hand cards are laid face down and the partner takes no part in the game.

=== Play ===
Play is as before: the eldest leads and players must follow suit if able, otherwise may play any card.

===Scoring and winning ===
The first team to score the target number of points (5, 7 or 10) wins the game. In Columbus, the target is 10. 

==== Scorekeeping markers ====
Scores can be kept by using two otherwise unused cards as markers, with each team often using cards of the same color.

Scoring begins using one card face up, covered by the other card face down. Upon winning points, the top card is moved to reveal the appropriate number of suit symbols on the bottom card. After all points are revealed on the lower card, the top card is flipped over, adding pips on both cards to indicate the score.

In Columbus, score is kept with a and a .

A variation of scorekeeping in Western New York and Ontario involves each side using the and of one suit. Scoring starts with counting the symbols on the cards, for points 1 to 4; at 5, the cards are turned over and crossed. Crossing the cards indicates 5 points. Points 6 to 9 are counted similarly by counting the number of suit symbols showing and adding them to the 5 when the cards are crossed.

In Canada and Michigan, it is common for each team to use two s of the same color to keep score, with one team red and the other black. The s are usually referred to as &quot;counting cards&quot; in this situation.

=== Infringements ===
==== Table talk ====
Euchre does not require silence as in some other games; some table talk is acceptable. However, communicating with one&#x27;s partner to influence the game is considered cheating. Unacceptable table talk may include code words, secret gestures, bidding out of turn or suggesting what the partner should play. Depending on the local rules, such infringements may incur a penalty.

==== Revoking ====
A player who does not follow suit when able has revoked. Sometimes this is called &quot;reneging&quot; but, strictly speaking, a renege refers to a situation in other card games when you may &quot;legally&quot; not follow suit when you can. If discovered, the opposing team is awarded two points or two points are deducted from the offending team.

=== North American terminology ===
Euchre terminology varies greatly from region to region and is highly colloquial. Some examples include:
* &quot;Ace, No-Face&quot;. Hand with an ace and four low cards (9s and 10s).
* &quot;Cut&quot;. Trump a led ace with the second card of the trick. (Indiana, Ohio).
* &quot;Dutchman&#x27;s Point&quot;. Point won when holding both bowers and the trump ace.
* &quot;Euchre Bustle&quot;. Euchre tournament (used in northern Midwest of United States).
* &quot;Euchred&quot; or &quot;Set&quot;. When the team that did not pick trump wins more tricks than the team that called the suit. (Indiana).
* &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Hand&quot;. Weak hand consisting only of s and s. Sometimes called &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Hand, Bottom Hand, No Ace — No face&quot; or &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Hand&quot;.
* &quot;In the Barn&quot;. A term used in the Midwest United States for having 9 points, being one away from winning. (Indiana, Ohio).
* &quot;Lay-Down&quot;. Hand that will win all five tricks if played in the correct order: for example, a Dutchman (both Bowers and the of trumps) plus the and of that suit, any other two trump cards, or one more trump card and an off-trump (when that player has the lead). Sometimes called a &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; or &quot;Loner&quot;, because the player will typically opt to go alone.
* &quot;Lay-Down Loner&quot;. Loner of unbeatable cards. Sometimes, instead of playing this hand, once trump is set, the person with the unbeatable cards can simply announce “alone”, and lay down their cards and receive their points. This is customary especially when there is no possible way for the other team to win a point. The 4 points are simply awarded to the team with the Lay-Down Loner and the game continues. (Indiana, Michigan).
* &quot;Loner&quot;. Hand suitable for going alone. (Indiana).
* &quot;Loner Range&quot;. A score of between 6 and 9 points, because 4 or fewer points are needed to win. It can also be used to describe being 4 points away from the opposing team. For example, when it is 4–8, the trailing team is in &quot;loner range&quot; of the team in front.
* &quot;Next&quot;. Call to entrump the suit of the same color as the original turnup. (Indiana, Ohio).
* &quot;Skunked&quot;. To lose a game without scoring any points.
* &quot;Sweep&quot; or &quot;March&quot;. Winning all tricks. (Indiana, Ohio).
* &quot;Throwing in&quot;. When the lead maker throws in the remaining cards in hand when three tricks have been assured, but five tricks are unlikely, e.g. one trick has already been won by the defenders, but the player throwing in possesses the highest cards remaining to be played.
* &quot;Trump your partner&quot; Refers to a situation where a player plays the card that wins a trick that their partner, who had played before them, would have otherwise won.
* &quot;Underman&quot;. When a player has an unprotected left Bauer and is forced to play it behind the right Bauer. As a way to provide comedic relief to a rather frustrating event, the victim will typically utter something along the lines of “oh dear, I’ve been undermanned”. The term is attributed to Alex Underman.
* &quot;Walk&quot;. When a low card is led and takes the trick. (Indiana).

=== Rule variations ===

The following North American rule variations are recorded:
* &quot;Ace No Face&quot;. In Ace No Face the player must have one and all s and s in their hand. The player then calls &quot;ace no face&quot; and exchanges three of their cards for the bottom three (must be called before the first card of the beginning trick has been led). Alternatively the player may call for a re-deal.
* &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Hand&quot;. A player with a hand of s and s may call &quot;farmer&#x27;s hand&quot; (or equivalent – see above) and shows their cards. Depending on the variant being played, they will either force a misdeal or can exchange three of their cards for the three face down cards in the kitty (referred to as &quot;going under&quot; or &quot;under the table&quot;).
* &quot;Dealing in packets&quot;. Cards are dealt in packets of twos and threes, but there is no requirement to follow a system.
* &quot;Defender going alone&quot;. If the trump maker goes alone, a defender may say &quot;defend alone&quot; before play begins.
* &quot;Extra cards&quot;. The addition of extra cards like eights and sevens can usually add more uncertainty as for which trump cards are still in the opponent&#x27;s hands during the course of the game. This uncertainty may be increased with the addition of the twos.
* First dealer. Before the start of play, the pack is shuffled and dealt out face up; the first player to receive a black jack deals first and, if desired, the second player with a jack is the partner.
* &quot;Kitty placement&quot;. Placed to the left of the dealer (not in the centre), as a reminder of who is dealing next.
* &quot;Making trump rule&quot;. A player may not make trump with only a jack but must have another trump. Sometimes this only applies to the dealer. Infringement is often treated as a revoke.
* &quot;Point on partner&quot;. When a partner steals their own partner&#x27;s deal successfully, in addition to retaining the deal, the team is also awarded one point. This Euchre Varriant was popularized by Bill Rome, winner of several Michigan and North Eastern Euchre championships including 2016 and 2018 &#x27;Michigan Traveling Euchre Tourney&#x27;, as well as winner of the 2016 and 2017 &#x27;Euchre Great Lakes Euchre Extravaganza&#x27;, and 2018 third place finisher in the &#x27;Tri-State Euchre Championship&#x27;.
* &quot;Robson rules&quot;. When a team wins all five tricks (normally or by going alone), they may choose to reduce the opposing team&#x27;s score (by two or four, respectively) instead of adding to their own score. Additionally, if the dealer turns up a jack on the kitty, they may elect to go alone without seeing the rest of their hand. If all tricks are won via this &quot;blind loner&quot; hand, five points are awarded instead of the usual four; but a failure to win all tricks earns the defenders one point. This rule was named after four-time Northern Michigan regional tournament runner-up champion James Robson.
* &quot;Stick the Dealer&quot;. If trump is not called it must be called by the dealer. Used to speed up the game, as it eliminates throw-in hands.
* &quot;Upcard&quot;. The dealer picks the upcard up instead of leaving it on the table until played.

== Variants ==

Euchre is a game with a large number of versions. They include versions for two to nine players, as well as changes in cards used, bidding, play, and scoring.

=== Bid Euchre ===

Bid Euchre, also known as Auction Euchre, Pepper, or Hasenpfeffer, is a group of North American variants. They introduce bidding in which the trump suit is decided by the player who bids to take the most tricks. There are variations in the number of cards dealt, the absence of any undealt cards, the bidding and scoring process, and the addition of a no trump declaration. It is typically a partnership game for four players. 

It can also be played by either three or four players competing as individuals (Indiana). In this variation, there are no undealt cards. Players start at 21 and try to be the first to zero, reducing their score by one point for each trick taken. The player winning the bid names either a trump suit or elects a &quot;no trump&quot; alternative which can either be high (A,K,Q,J,10,9) or low where 9&#x27;s are the best card of the sequence. Following the bidding, each player can elect to remain in the hand or fold. There are no penalties when a player folds, but their score is not reduced as no tricks were taken. Any player remaining in the hand must win at least one trick or is &quot;set&quot; five points which are then added to their total. If the maker fails to meet their bid, they are set five points. Other variations exist.

=== Set-Back Euchre ===
Set-Back Euchre is recorded as early as 1843 in Arkansas. Its rules first appear in William Brisbane Dick&#x27;s 1864 edition of &quot;The American Hoyle&quot;. The main difference is in the method of scoring. Although it can apply to games with 2, 3 or 4 players, in Dick&#x27;s example, four players agree a pool of $1 and each antes 25¢. Players begin with a score of 5 points each and play for themselves aiming to be first to zero. The trump maker plays alone against three defenders. A player who fails to take a trick adds 1 point. Anyone who is euchred adds 2 points and pays a stake of 25¢ to the pool.

A player doubtful of taking any tricks may throw up the hand to save being &quot;set back&quot;. The first player to zero points wins the game and the pool. Dick describes variations including the option for any player to say &quot;I declare&quot; which is a bid to make a &quot;march&quot; and win the game and pool if successful. Failure incurs a doubling of the point score and paying a stake. The &quot;march&quot; declarer leads to the first trick. Another variation was that, in the event of a &quot;euchre&quot;, the defenders deduct 2 points, in addition to the maker adding 2.

=== Three-handed Euchre ===

A variant for three players, three-handed Euchre is played like 24-card Euchre, with the following changes:
* Players play alone, rather than in teams.
* Each player plays to ten points and keeps their own score (using s and s as markers)
* Seven cards are dealt to each player, leaving three in the kitty (the top card is turned up).
* The person who makes trump is the &quot;maker&quot;. Both other players are &quot;defenders&quot;, but compete with each other for tricks.
* If the maker takes four tricks, they receive one point. If the maker takes six tricks, they receive two points. Taking all seven tricks gives the maker four points.
* If the maker does not take four tricks, they are euchred (set). The defender who took the most tricks will then receive two points. If both defenders took an equal number of tricks, they each receive one point.

Ace no face: a player dealt a hand that contains any number of aces but no face cards, may lay this hand on the table and call &quot;ace no face&quot;. This is considered a misdeal, and all the cards are gathered and re-dealt.

== Regional variations ==
In Australia and New Zealand, playing to 11 points (as in England) rather than 10 points (as in North America) is common.

In Britain, Canada Australia, and parts of New Zealand, if the dealer&#x27;s partner would like to order up the dealer in the suit turned up on top of the kitty, the dealer&#x27;s partner must play alone. Common practice in the US allows the dealer&#x27;s partner to &quot;assist&quot; and thus play in partnership with the dealer as the maker.

<text>The University of Otago () is a public research collegiate university based in Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand. Founded in 1869, Otago is New Zealand&#x27;s oldest university and one of the oldest universities in Oceania.

The university was created by a committee led by Thomas Burns, and officially established by an ordinance of the Otago Provincial Council in 1869. Between 1874 and 1961 the University of Otago was a part of the federal University of New Zealand, and issued degrees in its name.

Otago is known for its vibrant student life, particularly its flatting, which is often in old houses. Otago students have a long-standing tradition of naming their flats. The nickname for Otago students, &quot;Scarfie,&quot; comes from the habit of wearing a scarf during the cold southern winters. The nickname &quot;Scarfie&quot; has morphed into the nickname &quot;Breather&quot; in recent years. The university&#x27;s graduation song, &quot;Gaudeamus igitur, iuvenes dum sumus&quot; (&quot;Let us rejoice, while we are young&quot;), acknowledges students will continue to live up to the challenge, if not always in the way intended. The university&#x27;s student magazine, &quot;Critic&quot;, is New Zealand&#x27;s longest running student magazine.

==History==


===19th century===
The Otago Association&#x27;s plan for the European settlement of southern New Zealand, conceived under the principles of Edward Gibbon Wakefield in the 1840s, envisaged a university.

Dunedin leaders Thomas Burns and James Macandrew urged the Otago Provincial Council during the 1860s to set aside a land endowment for an institute of higher education. An ordinance of the council established the university in 1869, giving it of land and the power to grant degrees in Arts, Medicine, Law and Music. Burns was named Chancellor but he did not live to see the university open on 5 July 1871.

The university conferred just one degree, to Alexander Watt Williamson, before becoming an affiliated college of the federal University of New Zealand in 1874. With the dissolution of the University of New Zealand in 1961 and the passage of the University of Otago Amendment Act 1961, the university resumed its power to confer degrees.

Originally operating from William Mason&#x27;s Post Office building on Princes Street, it relocated to Maxwell Bury&#x27;s Clocktower and Geology buildings in 1878 and 1879. This evolved into the Clocktower complex, a striking group of Gothic revival buildings at the heart of the campus. These buildings were inspired by the then-new main building at the University of Glasgow in Scotland.

Otago was the first university in Australasia to permit women to take a law degree. Ethel Benjamin graduated LLB in 1897. Later that year she became the first woman in the British Empire to appear as counsel in court.

===20th century===
The University of Otago helped train medical personnel as part of the Otago University Medical Corps. They supplied or trained most of the New Zealand Army&#x27;s doctors and dentists during the First World War.

Professor Robert Jack made the first radio broadcast in New Zealand from the physics department on 17 November 1921.

Queen Elizabeth II visited the university library with the Duke of Edinburgh on 18 March 1970. This was the first time the royals completed informal &quot;walkabouts&quot; to meet the public, and it was the first visit of Prince Charles (then 21 years old) and Princess Anne (19 years) to this country.

===21st century===
In May 2010 the university joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Dartmouth College (US), Durham University (UK), Queen&#x27;s University (Canada), University of Tübingen (Germany), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden).

Beginning in 2015 university Vice-Chancellor Harlene Hayne and Pro-Vice-Chancellor Tony Ballantyne implemented cuts in academic and support staff which generated enduring controversy. In this context &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; characterised the university&#x27;s &#x27;climate&#x27; as one of top-down &#x27;suppression and fear&#x27; for its employees. The &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; reported on &#x27;demoralised teachers and researchers&#x27; who were &#x27;locked in pain and anger at what their institution had become&#x27; and later opined that &#x27;the university desperately needs a reset&#x27;. In 2020 the University of Otago announced that Hayne would be leaving the university and that Ballantyne would be given a new role, namely, leading the Division of External Engagement to attend to alumni relations and liaising with secondary schools, among other matters.

In December 2020, eight graduation ceremonies scheduled for that month were disrupted following threats to carry out a firearms and explosives attack on students attending graduation ceremonies scheduled for 7 and 8 December. On 18 December, a 22-year-old woman appeared in the Auckland District Court on charges of threatening harm to people or property. Court documents have described the threat as being of a &quot;magnitude surpassing the 15 March Christchurch mosque massacres.&quot; On 14 July 2021, the woman, who has interim name suppression, admitted to threatening to carry out a firearms and explosives attack against Otago students. Her lawyer applied for a discharge without conviction. On 12 May 2022, the woman was sentenced to five months community detention and nine months intensive supervision. According to the University Chancellor, the bomb threat and subsequent cancellation of eight graduation ceremonies caused the University NZ$1.3 million.

In mid-April 2023, Otago University reported that it was facing a NZ$60 million deficit due to declining student enrollments and a shortfall in government funding. In response, Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Helen Nicholson stated that the university was considering laying off several hundred staff members including academics. This marked the first time since its founding in 1878 that the university has faced a major debt crisis. According to the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot;, the university had only started borrowing in mid-December 2022, incurring a year-end debt of NZ$30 million. While the university was able to come out of debt in January 2023 following a regular injection of government funding, the university subsequently incurred more debt in 2023 due to its capital programme of refurbishing existing buildings and building new buildings. In response, students staged a protest against the proposed cuts. Otago University Students Association president Quintin Jane also called on Education Minister Jan Tinetti to increase funding for universities. In late May 2023, the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; reported that the university had declined to inform staff of its NZ$60 million budget shortfall in November 2022. In late June 2023, the Government announced a NZ$128 million funding injection for degree-level and postgraduate programmes for New Zealand universities and other tertiary institutions. In response, acting Vice-Chancellor Nicholson stated that the university would still proceed with job cuts since the funding would only come into effect from 2024 onwards.

In March 2024, Grant Robertson was designated as the next Vice-Chancellor, commencing July 2024. This announcement was accompanied by a &#x27;major&#x27; &#x27;almost wholesale&#x27; replacement of the university leadership. While University Chancellor Stephen Higgs and the university council supported Robertson&#x27;s appointment, there was mixed reception from donors. While some were supportive, several objected to appointing a former politician due to his non-academic background and record as Finance Minister. Several alumni also withheld donations and funding to Otago University following Robertson&#x27;s appointment. In mid May 2024, the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; reported that donations to the University&#x27;s Foundation Trust had declined from NZ$12.25 million in 2022 to NZ$7.09m in 2023. University development and alumni relations office director Shelagh Murray attributed the decline in donor funding to the ongoing impact of Covid-19, the economic recession and the cost-of-living crisis on individuals and businesses.

==Campuses and facilities==
=== Campuses ===
The University of Otago&#x27;s main campus is in Dunedin, which hosts the Central Administration as well as its Health Sciences, Humanities, Business School, and Sciences divisions. The architectural grandeur and accompanying gardens of the main campus in Dunedin led to its being ranked as one of the world&#x27;s most beautiful university campuses by the British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and American online news website &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. In addition, the university has four satellite campuses in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Invercargill.

#The Christchurch campus is based at the Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Science. It also provides medical and physiotherapy clinical training programs, research, distance education, and postgraduate programs.
#The Wellington campus is based at the Wellington School of Medicine and Health Science. It also provides medical and physiotherapy clinical training programs, research, distance education, and postgraduate programs.
#The Auckland campus is based at the Auckland Centre on Queen. The Auckland Centre provides various teaching and distance learning courses and serves as a liaison with the wider Auckland community and alumni.
#The Southland Campus (&quot;Ahuahu Te Mātauranga&quot;) is a branch of the University of Otago College of Education. The campus provides a range of early childhood, primary, primary bilingual, and secondary teacher education programs.
#The University of Otago&#x27;s Department of Marine Science also operates the Portobello Marine Laboratory in the Otago peninsula.
=== Libraries ===

The University of Otago has nine libraries: six based in Dunedin on the main university campus, the education library in Southland, plus two medical libraries in Wellington and Christchurch. All libraries have wireless access.

The Central Library is part of the Information Services Building and has over 2000 study spaces, 130 computer terminals, and laptop connections at 500 desks. It has Te Aka a Tāwhaki, a collection of Māori resources, and the Special Collections consisting of about 9,000 books printed before 1801. In total, the Central Library has over 800,000 print and electronic materials relating to the arts and humanities, commerce, education, physical education, social sciences, and technology. It was designed by the American architecture firm Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer and opened in 2001, replacing what was previously a 1960s-era modernist building.

==== Robert Stout Law Library ====
The Robert Stout Law Library is the university&#x27;s law library and is based in the Richardson Building.

==== Health Sciences Library ====
The Health Sciences Library is in the Sayers Building, opposite the main entrance to Dunedin Hospital. The Health Sciences Library book collection only includes the last 10 years of content, but does have over 150,000 volumes, the vast majority of which are in storage. There is seating for over 400.

==== Science Library ====
The Science Library is at the north end of the campus in the Science III building, with seating for approximately 500.

==== Hocken Collections ====
The Hocken Collections is a research library, archive, and art gallery of national significance which is administered by the University of Otago. The library&#x27;s specialist areas include items relating to the history of New Zealand and the Pacific, with specific emphasis on the Otago and Southland regions. The Hocken Collections was established in 1910 when Dunedin philanthropist Thomas Hocken donated his entire private collection to the University of Otago. It currently houses over 8,000 linear metres of archives and manuscripts. It is currently situated at the site of the former Otago Co-operative Dairy Company factory on Anzac Avenue, east of the main campus.

==== Robertson Library ====
The Robertson Library is the university&#x27;s education library and is jointly run by the University of Otago&#x27;s College of Education and Otago Polytechnic, which is also located near the university&#x27;s Dunedin campus.

==== Other libraries ====
The Wellington Medical and Health Sciences Library and the Canterbury Medical Library provide services to University of Otago students and staff, and the staff of the local District Health Boards. The university&#x27;s Southland Campus also has a library.

==Organisation and administration==
=== Organisation ===
The university is divided into four academic divisions:
* Division of Humanities
* Division of Health Sciences
* Division of Sciences
* Otago Business School (Division of Commerce)
For external and marketing purposes, the Division of Commerce is known as the Otago Business School, as that is the term commonly used for its equivalent in North America. Historically, there were a number of schools and faculties, which have now been grouped with stand alone departments to form these divisions.

In addition to the usual university disciplines, the University of Otago Medical School (founded 1875) is one of only two medical schools in New Zealand (with component schools in Dunedin, Christchurch and Wellington); and Otago is the only university in the country to offer training in Dentistry. Other professional schools and faculties not found in all New Zealand universities include Pharmacy, Physical Education, Physiotherapy, Medical Laboratory Science, and Surveying. It was also home to the School of Mines, until this was transferred to the University of Auckland in 1987. Theology is also offered, traditionally in conjunction with the School of Ministry, Knox College, and Holy Cross College, Mosgiel.

There are also a number of service divisions including:
* External Engagement Division
* Financial Services Division
* Human Resources Division
* Information Technology Services Division
* Property Services Division
* Research Division
* Student and Academic Services Division
* Operations Division
* Campus Development Division
* Campus and Collegiate Life Services Division
* Academic Division
* Health, Safety and Wellbeing

===Merger with Dunedin College of Education===
The University of Otago and the Dunedin College of Education (a specialist teacher training institution) merged on 1 January 2007. The University of Otago College of Education is now based on the college site, and includes the college&#x27;s campuses in Invercargill and Alexandra. Staff of the university&#x27;s Faculty of Education relocated to the college site. A merger had been considered before, however the present talks progressed further, and more amicably, than previously.

=== Residential colleges ===
The University of Otago owns, or is in affiliation with, fourteen residential colleges, which provide food, accommodation, social and welfare services. Most of these cater primarily for first year students, though some have a sizable number of second and higher year undergraduates, as well as occasionally a significant postgraduate population. While some teaching is normally undertaken at a college, this generally represents a small percentage of a resident&#x27;s formal tuition.

Most colleges actively seek to foster a sense of community and academic achievement amongst their members through, variously, intercollegiate competitions, communal dining, apartment groups, traditionalism, independent students&#x27; clubs, college events and internal sporting and cultural societies.

The colleges are geographically spread over the Dunedin urban area:
* Aquinas College
* Arana College
* Caroline Freeman College
* Carrington College
* Cumberland College
* Hayward College
* Knox College
* Salmond College
* Selwyn College
* St Margaret&#x27;s College
* Studholme College
* Te Rangi Hiroa College
* Toroa College
* University College
In mid October 2019, the University of Otago announced that it would be building a new 450-room residential college called Te Rangi Hiroa, which will replace the current Te Rangi Hiroa College along Cumberland Street. The new college is estimated to cost NZ$90 million and is located on the corner of Albany and Forth Streets near the Dunedin campus.

=== Coat of arms ===
In mid-March 2023, the university unveiled a new proposed logo replacing the traditional coat of arms with a symbol and a new Māori name for the institution as part of its Vision 2040 strategy. The process was spearheaded by Tony Ballantyne and the university&#x27;s Division of External Engagement. The proposed symbol is intended to symbolise the Otakou channel in Otago harbour while the coat of arms will be retained for ceremonial settings such as graduation events. The proposal also involves changing the current Māori name from &quot;Te Whare Wānanga o Otāgo&quot; to &quot;Ōtākou Whakaihu Waka&quot; (&quot;A Place of Many Firsts&quot;). Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Helen Nicholson stated that the proposed logo and name change was intended to create a visual identity that reflected modern Aotearoa New Zealand. The university also launched a consultation process for staff, students and alumni that will conclude on 16 April 2023. On 17 March 2023, an &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; survey found that 77% (1,908) of 2,479 respondents opposed the proposed logo change. The process was also criticised for costing about $700,000 whilst large numbers of academic staff were made redundant on the grounds of budgetary shortfalls.

On 11 July 2023, the University council voted to proceed with the logo and alternate Māori name change following a consultation process with staff, students, and alumni. Three quarters of respondents voted to replace the coat of arms with the O-shaped symbol while two thirds voted to change the Māori name from &quot;Te Whare Wānanga o Otāgo&quot; to &quot;Ōtākou Whakaihu Waka&quot; (&quot;A Place of Many Firsts&quot;). The new logo will be rolled out from March 2024 over a 12-month period at a cost of NZ$1.3 million.

In 1998, the physics department gained some fame for making the first Bose–Einstein condensate in the Southern Hemisphere.

The 2006 Government investigation into research quality (to serve as a basis for future funding) ranked Otago the top University in New Zealand overall, taking into account the quality of its staff and research produced. It was also ranked first in the categories of Clinical Medicine, Biomedical Science, Law, English Literature and Language, History and Earth Science. The Department of Philosophy received the highest score for any nominated academic unit. Otago had been ranked fourth in the 2004 assessment.

In 2006, a report released by the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology found that Otago was the most research intensive university in New Zealand, with 40% of staff time devoted to research and development.

Journal &quot;Science&quot; has recommended worldwide study of Otago&#x27;s Biochemistry database &quot;Transterm&quot;, which has genomic data on 40,000 species.

===Rankings===
The University of Otago is consistently ranked in the top 1% of universities in the world. The university has also been rated 5-Stars Plus by QS Stars in the QS World University Rankings. This is the maximum rating achievable under the QS Stars System, which takes into account the quality of Otago&#x27;s facilities, teaching, graduate employability, internationalisation, and inclusiveness. 
Besides having 5 subjects in the top 50 in the world, the University of Otago has 10 subjects ranked between 51st and 100th in QS World University Rankings. As well as having 15 subjects in the top 100 in the world, Otago has another 7 subjects in the top 101 to 150 band, and 6 subjects in the top 151 to 200 band. In 2015, the University of Otago became the first New Zealand university to have a course in a QS Top 10 list, being ranked 8th in Dentistry.


==Student life==
===O-Week===
&#x27;O-Week&#x27; or &quot;Orientation Week&quot; is the Otago equivalent of Freshers&#x27; Week. New students are most commonly known by their seniors as &#x27;freshers&#x27; or simply as &#x27;first-years&#x27;. O-week is organised by the Otago University Students&#x27; Association and involves competitions such as &#x27;Fresher of the Year&#x27; whereby several students volunteer to carry out a series of tasks throughout the week before being voted to win. Other competitions include that of different faculties facing off with each other. The OUSA also organises events each night including various concerts, a comedy night, hypnotist plus bigger events at Forsyth Barr Stadium. Typically there is a Highlanders rugby game scheduled during the week. Local bars organise events also with a range of live music and promotional deals. Historically events have included the Cookathon and a Miss O-Week competition hosted by The Outback.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.seenindunedin.co.nz/events/student/oweek_2005.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Cookathon was held by a local pub (the Cook) with the premise that your first drink costs you about $20 which gives you a t-shirt, three meal vouchers and reduced price on drinks then you spend the rest of the day binge drinking and &#x27;telephoning&#x27; the occasional jug with mates.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.varsity.co.nz/blog/orientation-otago.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
;Traditions
Each year the first years are encouraged to attend the toga parade and party dressed in white sheets wrapped as togas. Retailers called for an end of the parade after property damage and disorder during the 2009 event. However, the OUSA took it upon themselves to reintroduce this tradition, with a festival like event taking place at the stadium. 2012 Toga Party saw an unofficial world record. A clocktower race also occurs, in the style of &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. Students must race round the tower and attached building, beginning on the first chime of the clock at noon and completing before the chimes cease. Unlike &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, the task is possible with a couple of students completing each year.

===Behavioural issues===
Student behaviour is a major concern for both the university administration and Dunedin residents in general. Concerns over student behaviour prompted the university to introduce a Code of Conduct (CoC) which its students must abide by in 2007. The introduction of the CoC was accompanied by the establishment of the dedicated &#x27;Campus Watch&#x27; security force to keep tabs on crime and anti-social behaviour on campus and in the student neighbourhoods nearby. Campus Watch reports directly to the university&#x27;s Proctor.

;Riots
Riots took place in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 related to events surrounding the Undie 500 car rally organised by students from Canterbury University. Other student social events during the year such as the Toga Parade and the Hyde Street Keg Race are also notable for attracting police attention, but not to the scale of the Undie riots. In 2012 there were 80 people treated by emergency services and 15 arrests by police after the Hyde Street party went out of control.

;Protest
Otago students are notable for protesting over contentious political issues in nearly every decade. In the 1960s students at Otago who were involved with the Progressive Youth Movement led protests against the Vietnam War. In the 1960s mixed flatting (males and females were prohibited from sharing housing up to that time) was contested in various creative ways by Otago students. On 28 September 1993 Otago students protested against a fee increase at the University Registry (Clocktower Building), which ended in a violent clash with police. In the lead up to the 1996 general election students trying to stop a 25% fee increase occupied the University Registry (Clocktower Building) for over a week (which was followed by similar occupations at campuses around the country), fee increases were limited to 17%. Since 2004, the Otago University NORML club, led by Abe Gray, met weekly on the Otago campus to protest by smoking cannabis in defiance of New Zealand&#x27;s cannabis laws. In 2008, several members were arrested and issued with trespass notices banning them from the Union Lawn.

<text>Downpatrick () is a town in County Down, Northern Ireland. It is on the Lecale peninsula, about south of Belfast. In the Middle Ages, it was the capital of the Dál Fiatach, the main ruling dynasty of Ulaid. Its cathedral is said to be the burial place of Saint Patrick. Today, it is the county town of Down and the joint headquarters of Newry, Mourne and Down District Council.
Downpatrick had a population of 11,545 according to the 2021 Census.

==History==

===Pre-history===
An early Bronze Age site was excavated in the Meadowlands area of Downpatrick, revealing two roundhouses, one was four metres across and the other was over seven metres across. Archaeological excavations in the 1950s found what was thought to be a Bronze Age hillfort on Cathedral Hill, but further work in the 1980s revealed that this was a much later rampart surrounding an early Christian monastery.

===Early history===
Downpatrick is one of Ireland&#x27;s oldest towns. It takes its name from a &quot;dún&quot;, a medieval royal fort, which stood on a drumlin overlooking the River Quoile. In the Middle Ages, the river was an estuary that would have surrounded the drumlin on most sides. It is believed that there was a ringfort on the site in the early Middle Ages. This may have been the site called &quot;Ráth Celtchair&quot; (later anglicized Rathkeltair), the &#x27;fort of Celtchar&#x27;, after a hero in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology.

A small Christian monastic settlement was also built on the neighbouring drumlin to the south, now known as &#x27;Cathedral Hill&#x27;. Nearby Saul Monastery was associated with Saint Patrick. The saint is said to have been buried on Cathedral Hill in the 5th century, and his reputed grave is still a place of pilgrimage. Down Cathedral was later built on this spot.

In the early 11th century, a much bigger fort with earthen ramparts was built on the northern drumlin, now known as the &#x27;Mound of Down&#x27;. This was the capital of the Dál Fiatach, the main ruling dynasty of Ulaidh (Ulster), who held the title &quot;Rí Uladh&quot;, &quot;King of Ulster&quot;. Deirdre Flanagan suggests that the older name &quot;Dún Lethglaise&quot; referred to Cathedral Hill, while &quot;Dún da Lethglas&quot; was the name of this new royal residence.

The King of Norway, Magnus Barefoot, was killed in an ambush near Downpatrick in 1102. It is believed his grave is marked by a mound at Horse Island, southwest of Cathedral Hill.

Saint Malachy became the Bishop of Down (&quot;Dún da Lethglas&quot;) in 1137. He administered the diocese from Bangor and introduced a community of Augustinians (canons) to &quot;Dún da Lethglas&quot; dedicated to St John the Evangelist. Malachy and his successors repaired and enlarged Down Cathedral.

In the late 12th century, the area was conquered by Anglo-Normans led by John de Courcy, becoming part of his Earldom of Ulster. In February 1177, a Norman army of 300 men and 20 knights marched north from Dublin and took the town by surprise. The King of Ulster and Dál Fiatach, Ruaidrí mac Duinn Sléibe (Rory MacDunleavy), tried to retake the town, but was forced to withdraw after a fierce battle. The Normans began building a motte (fortified mound) inside the older royal fort, but abandoned it when de Courcy made Carrickfergus his capital in 1178.

In 1183, de Courcy brought in Benedictine monks from the abbey of St Werburgh in Chester (today Chester Cathedral), England. He built a friary for them at Downpatrick; this building was destroyed by an earthquake in 1245. He also re-dedicated the cathedral to Saint Patrick, giving it the name &quot;Ecclesia S. Patricii Duni&quot; in Latin. It is claimed that de Courcy miraculously found the bones of St Patrick, St Brigid and St Colmcille at Downpatrick. In the presence of the Papal Legate, Vivian, the relics were reburied inside the cathedral on 9 June 1196. This story of their discovery is thought to have been crafted by de Courcy for political reasons. In the Anglo-Norman and later medieval era the town&#x27;s name in Latin and English documentation is variously &#x27;Dunum&#x27;, &#x27;Dun&#x27; or &#x27;Down&#x27;. The oldest surviving record of the name &#x27;Downpatrick&#x27; is in the Bodley Survey of the early 1600s.

In 1260 Brian O&#x27;Neill, King of Tír Eoghain (Tyrone) and claimed High King of Ireland, marched to Downpatrick, which was then part of the Anglo-Norman earldom of Ulster. Allied with a Connacht force under Hugh O&#x27;Conor, he fought the Anglo-Normans in the Battle of Down. O&#x27;Neill was killed and the Irish were defeated. The death of O&#x27;Neill and defeat of the Irish was lamented in a poem by the Cenél nEógain bard Giolla Brighde Mac Con Midhe (1210–1272).

The earldom collapsed in the 1300s, but the English retained a foothold in Lecale. In 1375, Niall O&#x27;Neill of Tyrone defeated the English at Dundalethglas.

===Reformation and aftermath===

Under orders from King Henry VIII of England, Downpatrick&#x27;s monastic community was dissolved by the English around 1540, and the Cathedral fell into ruins. In 1600, the cathedral was allegedly burnt by English forces led by Edward Cromwell. A painting from 1788 shows the abbey ruins and its round tower.

The Archbishop of Armagh, composer of Irish bardic poetry and Christian poetry in the Classical Gaelic literary language, and Franciscan Counter-Reformation theologian Aodh Mac Cathmhaoil was born outside Downpatrick in 1571. On 21 January 1575, Franciscans John Lochran, Donagh O&#x27;Rorke, and Edmund Fitzsimon were hanged by Protestants at Downpatrick.

After his 25 April 1681 assassination by his foster brother, Art McCall O&#x27;Hanlon near Hilltown, County Down, rapparee leader Count Redmond O&#x27;Hanlon&#x27;s severed head was displayed spiked upon Downpatrick Gaol. The Count&#x27;s body was buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery at Ballynabeck, on the road between Tandragee and Scarva.

Cathedral Hill was the subject of an archaeological investigation in Series 5 of the Channel 4 &quot;Time Team&quot; programme.

===18th century===
Four main thoroughfares are shown converging on a town plan of 1724, namely English Street, Scotch (now Saul) Street, Barrack (now Scotch) Street, and Irish Street. The landscape limited the growth of the town. The early-18th-century street plan continued largely unchanged until 1838 when Church Street was built, followed by Market Street in 1846.

The condition of the town was greatly improved in the 18th century by a land-owning family named Southwell. The first Edward Southwell was responsible for building a shambles in 1719 and paving of the streets, which started in 1727. In 1717 he built a quay and grain store at Quoile Quay, contributing to the economic growth of the town. The second Edward Southwell was responsible for building Southwell School in 1733.

Down County Infirmary was established in a house in Saul Street in October 1767, where it operated for seven years. It was moved to Barrack Lane (now Fountain Street) where the former Horse Barracks was bought in 1774 for £150 by Bernard Ward, 1st Viscount Bangor for use as the . It was used until the new Infirmary (later known as the Downe Hospital) was opened in 1834.

In June 1778, John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, preached in the new preaching house in Downpatrick and in The Grove beside the ruins of Down Cathedral, which he called a &quot;noble ruin&quot;.

===19th century===
On 21 October 1803, a co-founder and leader of the United Irishmen, Thomas Russell, was hanged outside Downpatrick Gaol for his part in trying to raise local United Irishmen and Defenders in support of Robert Emmet&#x27;s rebellion in July of that year. Russell is buried in the graveyard of the Anglican parish Church of Downpatrick, St Margaret&#x27;s, in a grave paid for by his friend Mary Ann McCracken, sister of leading Belfast United Irishman Henry Joy McCracken who had been hanged in 1798.

In his role as barrister, Daniel O&#x27;Connell, &quot;The Liberator&quot;, was called away from London to Downpatrick to attend the County Down Assizes, as counsel in a case heard on 1 April 1829. As the leading campaigner for Catholic Emancipation, he had been in London for the parliamentary passage of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 which lifted the sacramental test bar to Catholics entering the British Parliament. On 2 April 1829, O&#x27;Connell attended a public dinner at Downpatrick in his honour, along with &quot;upwards of eighty gentlemen, of different religious persuasions&quot;.

On St Patrick&#x27;s Day, 17 March 1848, a crowd of 2,000–3,000 Catholics set off from Old Course Road intending to parade to the reputed grave of St Patrick on Cathedral Hill. They were attacked by Protestant Orangemen at the Irish Street shambles and a riot ensued.

===The Troubles===
There were many gun attacks and bombings in Downpatrick during the Troubles. The deadliest incident was the Downpatrick landmine attack on 9 April 1990. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) detonated a massive improvised land mine under a British Army convoy on Ballydugan Road, just outside the town. Four soldiers of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) were killed
