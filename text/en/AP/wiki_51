<text>Daphne () is a city in Baldwin County, Alabama, United States, on the eastern shoreline of Mobile Bay. The city is located along I-10, 11 miles east of Mobile and 170 miles southwest of the state capital of Montgomery. The 2020 United States census lists the population of the city as 27,462, making Daphne the most populous city in Baldwin County. It is a principal city of the Mobile, Alabama, Pensacola, Florida metropolitan area, which includes all of Baldwin County.

The inhabited history of what is now called Daphne dates at least to the Paleo-Indian period and Native American tribes around 9000 BC. Modern-day Daphne is a thriving suburb of nearby Mobile. Daphne has adopted the nickname ″The Jubilee City″ in recognition of its status as one of the locations of the Mobile Bay jubilee. The only other place jubilees occur is in Tokyo Bay. 

==History==
Daphne and the surrounding regions have been populated since from at least 9,000 BCE. European settlers eventually displaced the Native Americans. After a variety of wars and treaties the area became part of the United States in 1814. Except for a period under the flag of the Confederate States of America, Daphne and its environs have remained part of the United States until this time. From Native American, to the Spanish, French and British, the city has seen a lengthy parade of historic influences which gives Daphne its present character.

===Native American history===
Early settlers to the region were hunter-gatherer tribes similar to those in North Alabama. A variety of Native American populations visited the area that would become Daphne including Tensaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole. This area came to be known as neutral ground where tribes would meet and discuss the relationships between their nations. Small groups worked together to acquire food and to provide for their families. Initially, these groups enjoyed an economy based upon hunting and scavenging but as time passed production of weapons and pottery became more advanced. During the late Woodland stage Native Americans began to practice more elaborate ritual services. Although no burial grounds are known in Daphne, they are scattered throughout nearby Baldwin County.

By 1500, the zenith of Native American culture in South Alabama, it is estimated that a community of about 5,000 lived within 50 miles of the seacoast. These peoples were among the first who met Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1540. From this meeting forward, the original settlers faced a disaster from which they did not recover.

===European exploration and settlement===
Daphne and the surrounding land shifted between English, French, Spanish and United States control.

The Spanish were the first European settlers to the area of Daphne arriving in 1557. Spanish control in the area was weak and in 1710 French explorers claimed Mobile Bay, the Eastern Shore of the Bay including Daphne, and land east to Perdido Bay. The French claim was largely uncontested by the Spanish. In 1763, the British were ceded land, including the future Daphne, from the French in the Treaty of Paris (1763). The community of Daphne was established the same year and was known simply as the Village. Inasmuch as the British occupied nearby Mobile at the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Daphne passed into British hands, and served as the eastern terminal of a ferry across Mobile Bay.

British rule ended in 1783 when the area was surrendered to Spain by the Treaty of Paris (1783). The area remained under Spanish control for over 30 years. In November 1814, U.S. General Andrew Jackson crossed the bay with 3,000 troops, marched east to Pensacola and defeated the British thus finalizing American control over Daphne.

===Modern history===
Secession and the Civil War came quickly following the election of 1860. Statistics are not available for Daphne, but in Baldwin County 65% of homes held at least one slave. On January 11, 1861, Alabama seceded from the Union. It joined the Confederate States of America on March 13, 1861.
The town was named the county seat of Baldwin County, Alabama, in 1868 after the previous county seat, Blakeley, was deserted following the Civil War. At that time, Daphne was known as The Village of Bell Rose. Daphne was officially named and established, although unincorporated, on April 9, 1874, when the Post Office for Daphne was opened.

Baldwin County saw many distinct immigrant groups moving into the area in the late 19th century, particularly from Western Europe, and Daphne was the site of the first group which arrived in 1888. Alesandro Mastro Valero purchased land in Daphne to locate a refuge for Italian immigrants looking for a more pastoral alternative to the large urban cities of the north. In June 1895, land was purchased in Daphne for a Catholic church in what is now the center of Old Daphne to be built by the early Italian colonists. Father Angelo Chiariglione, a Scalbrini missionary from Torino, Italy, was the first resident pastor (1898–1909) of the church, known as the Church of the Assumption. This small-town church quickly gained the recognition of the Queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, who in 1898 sent a gift of rich vestments, an illuminated missal, a chalice, monstrance, candlesticks and other articles, and all are still on display in the present Christ the King Catholic Church, the cornerstone of which was laid in 1937.

Daphne remained the county seat until a legislative act of 1900, when the county seat was moved to Bay Minette. Daphne residents resisted the change and would not allow the county records to be removed. Those records were taken in a late night raid and moved to Bay Minette. According to another account, given in 1956 in an interview of one of the persons involved in the transfer, there was no raid; the arrangements for the move were made in advance between officials in both towns, and the county records were quietly loaded into wagons over a five-hour period on the evening of October 11, 1901, and then driven to Bay Minette the next day.

On July 8, 1927, Daphne was incorporated with a request for incorporation signed by 41 landowners. The initial population was listed as 500 residents. On September 19, 1927, the town held its first election. The first Mayor was James M. Voltz. An attempt in 1946 to revoke incorporation by unhappy residents failed.

In July 1997, Hurricane Danny struck the gulf coast bringing high winds and rains to the area. Due to the abnormal development of the storm, winds blew water out of Mobile Bay making it almost possible to walk across the bay. Hurricane Ivan made landfall in September 2004, south of Daphne near Gulf Shores, Alabama. The category 3 storm brought widespread flooding and damage throughout Daphne. The next year, Daphne weathered some effects of Hurricane Katrina although not nearly as severe as the 2004 storm.

In February 2008, Daphne became the last of the large cities in Baldwin County to enact a public smoking ban. After contentious council meetings, the ban was passed while exempting bars, private clubs and up to 30% of rooms in a hotel.

In November 2010, the Daphne City Council enacted a ban against texting while driving, becoming the first Mobile-area municipality to do so.

==Geography==
Daphne is located at 30°37&#x27;52.640&quot; North, 87°53&#x27;11.184&quot; West (30.631289, -87.886440). It is one of three cities that are collectively known as the Eastern Shore by locals. They are Spanish Fort to the north, Daphne in the center and Fairhope to the south.

The topography of Daphne is quite consistent from a gently sloping sea level on the west to low rolling hills further east. Generally, the entire city lies no more than 150 feet above sea level. The land along the Daphne bay coast, like other land throughout the county, is rich with sandy-loam type soils.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and (4.47%) is water.

Daphne is also known as the &quot;Jubilee City.&quot; A Jubilee in Mobile Bay occurs when crab, shrimp, and other sea life from the waters of Mobile Bay are suddenly found washed ashore along the coastline. Biologists believe the phenomenon is due to a possible decrease in water oxygen levels which force the fish to the surface.

Nearby communities include: Fairhope, Spanish Fort, Loxley, Mobile,
Point Clear, Robertsdale, Silverhill, Summerdale, Gulf Shores, Orange Beach, Bay Minette, Foley, Magnolia Springs, Elberta, Belforest, and Malbis.

==Demographics==
Daphne, like the surrounding Baldwin and Mobile counties, was settled by persons of varying nationalities who eventually melded into the American experiment.

The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 2.97.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 25.6% under the age of 18, 6.9% from 18 to 24, 31.6% from 25 to 44, 25.6% from 45 to 64, and 10.3% who were 65 years of age or older.

Daphne&#x27;s growth, along with the growth of other Eastern Shore communities, has been linked to the growth of nearby Mobile. For years the Eastern Shore communities were a quick vacation destination but as the large municipality grew, Daphne grew too.

==Economy==
Daphne is a suburb of nearby Mobile, Alabama. In 2007, Daphne saw retail sales of $653,422,000 or $34,438 per capita which compares favorably to the national average of $12,364. The median household income was $62,376 against a national average of $42,934, both measured through the 2007–2011 period. The home ownership was 74.6% and the median home value (2007–2011) was $187,000. The city is part of the Daphne-Fairhope-Foley metropolitan statistical area and was named among the top 10 such areas nationwide by Site Selection Magazine. The ranking is for areas with less than 200,000 population and is based upon the number of companies either expanding or relocating to the area.

Primary employment in Daphne is divided among education, healthcare and social assistance employers. Retail trade operations are a close second. Agriculture, once a primary foundation of the Daphne economy, now represents less than 0.6% of economic output. The economy is further supported by access to nearby Mobile, and large retail operations in Spanish Fort, just to the north. The largest employer in the county is the Baldwin County Board of Education which supports over 3,000 employees in Baldwin County. 70% of the $305 million budget pays salaries countywide

Like much of the nation, Daphne saw the economy plummet during the 2008 recession. Commercial real estate prices were especially hard hit. Investors who looked for a continued rise in values in Daphne were surprised to see their investments bottom out by 2012. However construction is underway by Airbus to build the A320 commercial jet at nearby Brookley Field in Mobile. That assembly plant is expected to generate 1,000 new jobs by 2018 and is expected to positively impact Daphne and the entire Baldwin County.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
For many years Daphne was isolated from the larger city of Mobile. A ferry was the only mode of transport from the eastern shore to the western shore. In 1929 a toll bridge was opened which crossed into Mobile. That bridge was replaced by the Cochrane-Africatown bridge. Also in 1929, US 98 was paved from Pensacola, through Daphne and into Mobile.

Interstate 10 travels near the northern border of Daphne. There are three exits into Daphne including intersections with US 98, US 90 and AL 181. Major routes within the city are grid style and include Baldwin County 13, Whispering Pine Road and Daphne Avenue.

Elberta High School opened to grade nine as of August 2017 and had its first graduating class in 2021.

==History==

Elberta was founded in the early 20th century by a Chicago-based land company. The Baldwin County Colonization Company was organized in 1903, and the first settlers arrived in 1904. The community was founded by farmers who had immigrated from Germany to the Midwest of America. The land company advertised the area as having rich soil and a climate that allowed year-round farming. The first two organized churches were Lutheran (1908) and Catholic (1905).

The land company laid out Baldwin County in the manner found in the Midwest; that is to say, roads were laid out on section lines that were due north-south and east-west. Property, especially farms, were laid out in squares. With the immigration taking these farmers through Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and other Midwestern states, the early years of the community resembled Midwestern farming communities more than those of the Deep South. In the 1930s through the 1940s, the town boasted a farmer&#x27;s hall where dancing and singing were enjoyed, a hotel, and a movie theatre, as well as a butcher shop, grocery and drug store. Many of the residents spoke German, and St. Mark&#x27;s Lutheran Church offered German-language services until 1976.

The State Bank of Elberta was incorporated in 1922. The bank was unusual in that it did not close during the Great Depression.

The town was incorporated by vote on December 9, 1952.

To support the town&#x27;s volunteer fire department, the Elberta German Sausage Festival was started in the mid-1970s. This event is held the last weekend of March and the last weekend of October and features polka music, Elberta German Sausage, and 250 arts and crafts vendors. In 2014, the October festival saw an estimated 40,000 visitors.

The town is the home of the Baldwin County Heritage Museum. The museum is located on U.S. Highway 98 east of the town. It features exhibits devoted to the development of Baldwin County. The museum includes a large amount of farm equipment and exhibits of life in farm homes. The old St. Mark&#x27;s Lutheran Church building was moved to the grounds and restored.

<text>Fairhope is a city in Baldwin County, Alabama, United States, located on the eastern shoreline of Mobile Bay. The population was 22,477 at the 2020 census. Fairhope is a principal city of the Mobile, Alabama, Pensacola, Florida metropolitan area]], which includes all of Baldwin County.

==History==
Fairhope was founded on November 15, 1894, on the site of the former Alabama City as a Georgist &quot;Single-Tax&quot; colony by the Fairhope Industrial Association, a group of 28 followers of economist Henry George who had incorporated earlier that year in Des Moines, Iowa. Their corporate constitution explained their purpose in founding a new colony:

In forming their demonstration project, they pooled their funds to purchase land at &quot;Stapleton&#x27;s pasture&quot; on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay and then divided it into a number of long-term leaseholds. The corporation paid all governmental taxes from rents paid by the lessees, thus simulating a single-tax. The purpose of the single-tax colony was to eliminate disincentives for productive use of land and thereby retain the value of land for the community.

&quot;Fairhope Avenue&quot; was one of the properties on the 1910 version of the board game &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot;, a precursor of &quot;Monopoly&quot;.

In 1907, educator Marietta Johnson founded the School for Organic Education in Fairhope. The school was praised in John Dewey&#x27;s influential 1915 book &quot;Schools of Tomorrow&quot;. Dewey and Johnson were founding members of the Progressive Education Association.

Fairhope became a popular wintering spot for artists and intellectuals. Sherwood Anderson, Clarence Darrow, Wharton Esherick, Carl Zigrosser, and Upton Sinclair were among its notable visitors.

The Fairhope Single-Tax Corporation still operates, with 1,800 leaseholds covering more than in and around the current city of Fairhope. Despite the ideals of the corporation, the town has transitioned from utopian experiment to artists&#x27; and intellectuals&#x27; colony to boutique resort and affluent suburb of Mobile. White flight from nearby Mobile has caused the population of Baldwin County to almost triple since the 1940s, and particularly since desegregation, contributing to the mostly-White demographics of Daphne, Fairhope, and Spanish Fort.

In 2019 the New York Times termed Fairhope to be &quot;A Southern Town That’s Been Holding On to Its Charm, for More Than a Century&quot;.

==History==
Foley was named for its founder, John B. Foley of Chicago. As Foley was traveling to President William McKinley&#x27;s funeral in 1901, he met a railroad agent who told him of the area in South Baldwin County. Foley came down the following year, and liked what he saw, buying between and of land. He then returned to Chicago and formed the Magnolia Springs Land Company, currently known as the Magnolia Land Company. As he began to sell off acreage, he realized the need for a better way for the people to come to Foley.

Foley used some of his own money to lay the rails so the train could come from Bay Minette. The first railroad station was built in 1905. The original station burned in 1908 and was replaced the following year by the station that is now the city&#x27;s museum. John Foley donated parcels of land for a school, railroad station, park and churches. These included the current Catholic Church, Saint Margaret of Scotland, the Baptist church and the Methodist church. He also invested in a hotel, a demonstration farm, a bank and the utility company.

The first train to service Foley was a wood burner called the &quot;Pine Knot Special.&quot; It would leave Foley in the morning and make a return trip in the afternoon.

Some residents opposed the building of a new hotel on state property, and the use of BP Oil spill funds to finance projects other than environmental repair.

In 2022, the city introduced a plan to make a $15 million revitalization of Gulf Place, a public beach area. Amenities will include a boardwalk, parking, green space, and restrooms. The project will involve sustainable and low-impact development strategies, including stormwater management, and beach dune restoration to provide animal habitat and protection from storm surge.

== Point Clear in World War II ==

In 1944, Point Clear&#x27;s Grand Hotel served as the base of operations for Operation Ivory Soap in World War II. In the Pacific Theater, the United States utilized the Leapfrogging (strategy) as a means of capturing islands held by the Japanese that were of strategic or tactical advantage. The commander of the U.S. Army Air Corps, Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, understood the American planes needed mobile air depots to support their efforts in the Pacific. Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Thompson, oversaw Operation Ivory Soap from a suite in the Grand Hotel. The nineteenth-century Alabama hotel housed soldiers and served as a maritime training facility training troops in skills including swimming, special calisthenics, marching, drill, navigation, ship identification, signaling, cargo handling, ship orientation, sail making and amphibious operations. The school produced 5,000 trained Army seamen who took part in operations in the Philippines, Iwo Jima, and Guam. The training these troops received thanks to Operation Ivory Soap allowed the soldiers to help save countless lives and aircraft. The name &quot;Ivory Soap,&quot; according to Col. Thompson, was derived from the fact that, like the experimental Aircraft Repair Units the military wanted to deploy, Ivory soap floats. The Grand Hotel is still in operation on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay today.

== Other ==
From as early as the 1800s, wealthy families from Mobile, New Orleans and across the United States chose to spend their summers in Point Clear. In the days of yellow fever outbreaks, Pt. Clear residents believed they were escaping to what was deemed as &quot;good air&quot; because of the daily breeze off Mobile Bay. Arrival to the area was traditionally by ferry boat and most people arrived in Pt. Clear at Zundel&#x27;s Wharf. Because of this, the front of the homes (sometimes referred to as cottages) face Mobile Bay and there is a boardwalk between the water and the homes leading to and from Zundel&#x27;s Wharf. Remnants of the old pier at the Zundel property were still visible prior to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

<text>Spanish Fort is a city in Baldwin County, Alabama, United States, located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. The 2020 census lists the population of the city as 10,049. It is a suburb of Mobile and is part of the Daphne-Fairhope-Foley metropolitan area.

== History ==

The city of Spanish Fort is rich in history dating as far back as 1712 with the founding of Mobile by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville of France. Spanish Fort was originally the site of a trading post established by French-occupied Mobile. Following the French and Indian War, a large area on the Gulf Coast including the trading post was ceded to the British in 1763. During the Revolutionary War after the Spanish took Mobile and surrounding areas in the Battle of Fort Charlotte, a &quot;presidio&quot; or military fort was built on the site of the old trading post. This &quot;Spanish Fort&quot; was the site of a counterattack by British forces dispatched from Pensacola in 1781. The British were driven back and unsuccessful in recapturing the area. Following the Adams–Onís Treaty, Spanish Fort, as it was now commonly referred to, was officially property of the United States.

During the American Civil War, Spanish Fort was heavily fortified as an eastern defense to the city of Mobile. Fort Huger, Fort (Battery) Tracey, Fort (Battery) McDermott, Fort Alexis, Red Fort, and Old Spanish Fort were all part of the Mobile defenses in what is now Spanish Fort. After the Union victory in the Battle of Mobile Bay, Mobile nevertheless remained in Confederate hands. Union forces embarked on a land campaign in early 1865 to take Mobile from the east. Spanish Fort was the site of the Battle of Spanish Fort in the Mobile Campaign of the war. Its fall allowed Union forces to concentrate on Fort Blakeley to the north, and hence destroy the last organized resistance east of the Mississippi River. The falls of Spanish Fort and Fort Blakeley permitted Union troops to subsequently enter Mobile unopposed after the conclusion of the Civil War.

Since incorporating on July 19, 1993, Spanish Fort has seen significant growth. Eastern Shore Centre, an open air regional shopping complex, opened on November 17, 2004. Spanish Fort Town Center contributed to the municipality&#x27;s substantial commercial development, despite having ongoing issues with vacancies.

On November 1, 2012, groundbreaking ceremonies were held at the northwest corner of Spanish Fort Boulevard and Blakeley Way, site of the new Spanish Fort Community Center. Though progress on the construction was often hindered by rainy weather and other hurdles, the administrative staff officially occupied the new facility in September 2015. The center is home to the city library, administrative offices, the mayor&#x27;s office, and other city-run services. The municipal complex is roughly 30,000 square feet and cost the city approximately $5 million to build. The complex sits on 17-acres of prime land and features a large pond with two fountains and a pavilion. The city also hosts community outreach events along with city council and budget meetings.

<text>Wroxham Broad is an area of open water alongside the River Bure near the village of Wroxham in Norfolk, England within The Broads National Park. The Norfolk Broads were formed by the flooding of ancient peat workings. Wroxham Broad has an area of and a mean depth of 1.3 metres. It lies to the west of the Bure, with two navigable openings between river and broad. The village and broad lie in an area of fairly intensive agriculture, with areas of wet woodland adjoining the broad and river.

Since 1937, under lease from the Trafford estate, the broad has been home to the Norfolk Broads Yacht Club. Visiting boats are not allowed to land, but navigation is allowed.

Between 2000 and 2005 the island between the two channels linking Wroxham Broad to the Bure underwent restoration to stop erosion and improve the island&#x27;s ecology, which had become degraded. The project was a joint initiative involving the Broads Authority, Norfolk Broads Yacht Club and the local landowner, Trafford Estates. Scrub was cleared and a stretch of piling installed, allowing sedge, reed and rush to grow back. By 2005 it was reported that more birds, including kingfishers, were nesting on the island and the rare Cetti&#x27;s warbler was often spotted. Greater numbers of ducks, including pochard and tufted ducks, now wintered nearby and there was a greater profusion of wild flowers and marsh flora including orchids. During the course of the work, in 2004, volunteers came across an unexploded Second World War hand grenade in the dredgings, which was exploded by an army bomb disposal team.

Close to Wroxham Broad stands the early 18th century Broad House, a Queen Anne style estate house and formerly the seat of the local land-owning Trafford family. In 2006, it became a well-regarded &#x27;boutique&#x27; hotel which closed in late 2010. There are proposals that it be reclassified as a single dwelling.

Alfred John Norman Chamberlin (1822–1883), and his wife Betsy, owned the Broad House property and most of the Wroxham Broad, before the Traffords acquired it after Alfred&#x27;s death about 1885. People flocked to their property to watch the Wroxham Regatta. (See painting &quot;Wroxham Regatta -1868&quot; by Claude Nursey.) Alfred had inherited the 300 acre property about 1858 from his unmarried cousin, Elizabeth Foulsham (1774–1857). She had inherited it from her unmarried half-brother, William Buckle (1765–1840) who had inherited it from his maternal grandfather, John Howse (d. 1817). Howse&#x27;s forebears had owned the property since 1735. Prior owners have been recorded back to 1593.

There is a locomotive at the Bure Valley Railway in Norfolk which is named after Wroxham Broad.
==In literature==
The Broad features in &quot;Coot Club&quot; and &quot;The Big Six&quot;, two books by Arthur Ransome set in the Norfolk Broads.

<text>Hoveton Little Broad, also known as Black Horse Broad, is a secluded broad of fairly open aspect, in the middle reaches of the River Bure between Hoveton and Horning, Norfolk, in The Norfolk Broads. Privately owned, it was the site of direct action in the mid-20th century by local people hoping to establish the right of free public access to all Broadland waterways.
==Situation and access==
The broad is closer to Horning than to the village of Hoveton and lies adjacent to the hamlet of Hoveton St John. Inaccessible by road, it is linked to the river by Black Horse Dyke. Another dyke (a narrow waterway) leads from a corner of the broad to the main Hoveton-Horning road B1354. Just up hill towards Hoveton formerly stood the Black Horse pub, which gave the broad its alternative name. A waterlogged footpath to the road was used by the Norfolk wherrymen as they made their way to the pub. Like Martham Broad and Horsey Mere, this broad is closed for navigation in the winter months, to enable the waterbirds to breed. There are no staithes on the shore of the broad for public mooring and no shore based facilities.

==Pound End Broad==
One end of the broad is partially enclosed by projecting spits of land and known as Pound End Broad. It is a mixed coarse fishery and is closed permanently to watercraft. A bird exclosure was built here in the mid 1990s to protect an area of marginal vegetation, preventing water plants being damaged by coots. Keeping the birds out of this area had the incidental effect of creating a fish refuge, heavily used by all the resident species of fish, numbers of which increased compared to fish in the main broad.

==&#x27;The Invasion of Black Horse Broad&#x27;, 1949==
In the mid-20th century, Hoveton Little Broad played a role in the historical dispute between landowners and the public over rights of access to private broads. Since time immemorial, all Broadland waters had been considered part of the King&#x27;s River and thus freely accessible to all. However, in the 19th century, several Norfolk landowners prevented access to broads in their ownership from the main river network under the inclosure acts. Boatbuilder Herbert Woods led a public campaign against the landowners&#x27; action, culminating in the &#x27;invasion of Black Horse Broad&#x27; in March 1949. Woods and 30 local men dismantled the barrier that the landowner had placed across Black Horse Dyke. This direct action resulted in an agreement with the broad&#x27;s owner, who agreed to open the broad to the public each year between Easter and mid-September. However, this campaign did not lead to the re-opening of other closed broads.

<text>St Olaves is a village in the English county of Norfolk. The village is situated on the River Waveney, south-west of the town of Great Yarmouth and the same distance north-west of the Suffolk town of Lowestoft. It is within The Broads national park.

Today the village forms part of the civil parish of Fritton and St Olaves, which in turn is within the district of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. Prior to local government reorganisation in 1974 however, the village was part of the parish of Herringfleet in the Lothingland Rural District of Suffolk.

St Olaves Bridge, a suspension bridge, is the first bridging point on the Waveney above Great Yarmouth. Haddiscoe railway station, on the Wherry Lines service between Norwich and Lowestoft, is across the bridge approximately from the centre of the village. St Olaves used to have its own railway station, which closed in 1959.

The village is the location of the remains of a 13th-century Augustinian priory. St. Olaves Priory was dedicated to St Olav. On the site there are parts of the refectory, cloisters, and the priory mill.

<text>Somerleyton ( ) is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Somerleyton, Ashby and Herringfleet, in the East Suffolk district, in the north of the English county of Suffolk. It is north-west of Lowestoft and south-west of Great Yarmouth. The village is closely associated with Somerleyton Hall and was largely rebuilt as a model village in the 19th century at the direction of Samuel Morton Peto. The parish was combined with Herringfleet and Ashby to create the parish of &quot;Somerleyton, Ashby and Herringfleet&quot; on 1 April 1987.

The village is on the edge of The Broads national park with the River Waveney forming the western boundary of the former parish. This forms the county border with Norfolk and the Suffolk village of Blundeston is to the east. The village has a population of around 300.

==History==
At the time of the Domesday Book, the manor of Somerleyton was held by the king. It was named &quot;Sumerledetuna&quot; and was recorded as having 17 families living in the village. The manor was owned by the Jernegan family from the early 14th century. The family built Somerleyton Hall in around 1579.

The hall was bought by Sir Thomas Wentworth in the early 17th century and was substantially remodelled by the Wentworth family as a mansion house. This included a deer park which was established by 1652. The estate was occupied by Parliamentarian troops a number of times during the Civil War and was purchased by Admiral Sir Thomas Allin in 1669. It remained in Allin&#x27;s family until it was acquired by railway developer Samuel Morton Peto, who oversaw the latest rebuilding in 1843. The hall and the park and gardens are Grade II* listed buildings.

Peto directed the rebuilding of the village at the same time, creating a model village based on Blaise Hamlet near Bristol. The development of both the hall and village was designed by John Thomas. The rebuilding process bankrupted Peto and the estate was sold to Sir Francis Crossley, a carpet manufacturer from Halifax, West Yorkshire. The title of Baron Somerleyton was created for Crossley&#x27;s son, Savile in 1916.

A memorial to two airmen killed in a friendly fire incident during World War II is on Waddling Way, an un-metalled road east of the village which runs towards Flixton. A Royal Air Force DeHavilland Mosquito nightfighter being flown by two American Navy pilots was mistakenly shot down by British anti-aircraft fire.

In the 1950s, Christopher Cockerell designed and tested the first hovercraft at his boatyard in the village. A column was erected in the village in 2010 on the 100th anniversary of Cockerell&#x27;s birth.

In 1971 the civil parish had a population of 319.

==Somerleyton Hall==

The Victorian rebuilding of Somerleyton Hall created a mainly two-storey mansion, mainly in the Jacobean style. It features a French Renaissance inspired loggia and a square belvedere clock tower, although the house has a 17th-century core and some of the wood panelling from the original building has been reused internally. The rebuilding was led by Samuel Morton Peto, who owned the estate in the 19th century, with the designs for the house the work of sculptor John Thomas. Thomas was also responsible for the designs for the rebuilding of the village and parish church. The clock was the work of Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy.

The park surrounding the hall was established in the 17th century and expanded during Peto&#x27;s ownership to one of . This included the building of a series of formal gardens designed by William Andrews Nesfield and includes a kitchen garden with glasshouses probably designed by Joseph Paxton. The only other example of similar work by Paxton is at Chatsworth House. The park features two sculptures by Thomas and one by Gustav Natorp as well as a yew hedge maze.

The house is the home of the Crossley family and both the house and grounds are open to the public as a tourist attraction. The estate owns a wide range of assets throughout the local area, including the Somerleyton village pub and a country park at Fritton Lake.

==Culture and community==

Somerleyton has a primary school, built as part of the development of the model village, a village hall and playing field as well as a public house, the &quot;Dukes Head&quot;. The Somerleyton Estate remains a major landowner throughout the surrounding area. Many of the houses in the village are listed buildings and development is restricted to preserve the period style of the village.

The Lowestoft to Norwich railway line runs through the parish close to the Waveney, crossing the river at Somerleyton Swing Bridge. Somerleyton railway station on the edge of the village has operated since 1847. The lines passes close to Cockerell&#x27;s boatyard, Somerleyton Marina, and the site of the former Somerleyton brickworks which produced bricks for the buildings such as Liverpool Street railway station. The brickworks closed in 1939 and the chimneys were subsequently demolished.

==Church of St Mary==

The parish church is dedicated to St Mary and stands in Somerleyton Park close to the hall. The building retains a 15th-century tower but was otherwise rebuilt at Peto&#x27;s direction, the design again completed by Thomas. The rebuilding process discovered a medieval stone slab with the symbols of the Four Evangelists beneath the floor boards. It is presumed to have been hidden during the Reformation and has been replaced over the south doorway. The rood screen and baptismal font both date from the 15th century, the former with 16 panels with paintings of saints. The building is a Grade II* listed building.

==In literature and television==
The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; took place at Somerleyton Hall in 2009, with selected excerpts to form a one-hour broadcast in 2010. An episode of Roald Dahl&#x27;s Tales of the Unexpected TV series was filmed at Somerleyton Hall in 1979, and the house was used as a stand in for Sandringham House in the 2003 television drama &quot;The Lost Prince&quot;. The house was used for the same purpose in the 2020 series &quot;The Crown&quot;.

<text>Ditchingham is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk.

Ditchingham is located north of Bungay and south-east of Norwich, along the course of the River Waveney.

==History==
Ditchingham&#x27;s name is of Anglo-Saxon origin and derives from the Old English for the homestead or settlement of &#x27;Dicca&#x27;s&#x27; people.

In the Domesday Book, Ditchingham is listed as a settlement of 36 households in the hundred of Lodding. In 1086, the village formed part of the East Anglian estates of King William I.

In 1855, an Anglican convent known as the Community of All Hallows was founded in Ditchingham by Lavinia Crosse and Reverend William E. Scudamore. The convent acted as a refuge for women in &#x27;moral danger&#x27; and other destitute individuals. The community closed in 2018.

Lilias Rider Haggard&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Rabbit Skin Cap (1939)&quot; tells the life story of George Baldry, a local inventor and poacher. The picture on the front cover of the book is a painting by Edward Seago of local schoolboy, Douglas Walter Gower. In later life, Gower discovered the tusk of a woolly mammoth near the long barrow on Broome Heath which is now displayed in Norwich Castle Museum.

Much of the surrounding countryside is part of the estate centred on Ditchingham Hall which was built in the 18th century and features gardens designed by Capability Brown. The Hall is the ancestral seat of the Earl Ferrers and is currently in the possession of Robert Shirley, 14th Earl Ferrers.

In the Nineteenth Century, a silk factory was built in Ditchingham which was later converted into a maltings and later use as a depot for the US Army during the Second World War. The building was severely damaged by fire in 1999 and is now in residential use.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census, Ditchingham has a total population of 1,823 people which demonstrates an increase from the 1,635 people listed in the 2011 census.

Ditchingham is located on the course of the River Waveney with the junction of the A143, between Gorleston-on-Sea and Haverhill, and the B1332, between Trowse and Ditchingham, is located in the parish.

==St. Mary&#x27;s Church==
Ditchingham&#x27;s parish church is dedicated to Saint Mary and dates from the Fifteenth Century. St. Mary&#x27;s is located on Church Lane and has been Grade I listed since 1960.

St. Mary&#x27;s was restored in 1846 by Anthony Salvin and again in the 1870s by Frederick Preedy.The church boasts an interesting set of stained-glass windows depicting Edmund Tudor with Lady Margaret Beaufort as well as others which may have been imported from Europe after the Napoleonic Wars.

==Chicken Roundabout==
Ditchingham&#x27;s Chicken Roundabout had been home to a group of feral chickens as early as the mid-1990s, cared for by a local man called Gordon Knowles. The number of birds living at the roundabout increased and declined over the years due to a range of factors including Avian influenza and theft. In 2010, the remaining chickens were given to an animal charity with a plaque to Knowles&#x27; role in the community being erected in 2012.

Parravani&#x27;s ice creams were established in the village in the early C20, and Lamberts Coaches are another long-established local company.

<text>The Milton Hershey School, formerly the Hershey Industrial School, is a private boarding school in Hershey, Pennsylvania for K–12 students. The institution was founded in 1909 by chocolate industrialist Milton Hershey and his wife, Catherine Hershey.

The school began with four students in 1910. Initially for only white male orphans, the school expanded in the 1960s and 70s to include girls, racial minorities, and &quot;social orphans&quot;—those with impoverished parents. About 2,000 students attended the school in 2020. Admission is restricted to low-income individuals aged 4–15 without intellectual or behavioral problems. Students live in group homes of uniform sex and similar age, with set schedules for elementary, middle, and high school students. The school has Christian elements but is officially non-sectarian. 

The school is free for students and is funded by a trust containing most of Hershey&#x27;s fortune, valued at about US$15 billion, making it the wealthiest U.S. private school. Nearly half of the trust&#x27;s money comes from its controlling interest in Hershey&#x27;s eponymous chocolate company.

== History ==
Milton S. Hershey, creator of The Hershey Company, was a chocolate industrialist and had founded the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania. On November 15, 1909, he and his wife, Catherine Hershey, signed over a piece of farmland, forming the Hershey Industrial School. The school accepted &quot;poor, healthy, white male orphans&quot; between the ages of four and eight, allowing them to stay until the age of eighteen. The first four boys were admitted in September 1910.

In 1918, following Catherine&#x27;s death three years prior, Milton put most of his fortune—including his share of his company&#x27;s stock—into a trust for the school, valued at $60 million altogether. The school grew quickly, with about 60 boys in 1915, 352 boys in 1931, and 1034 boys in 1937. Non-sectarian Christian religious training was mandatory.

In 1933, the age range of admitted orphans was expanded from 4–8 years to 4–14. In 1934, a junior-senior high school building was opened at the site with a capacity for 1500 students. Hershey resigned from the school&#x27;s board in 1944, a year before his death. By then the school had acquired about 10,000 acres of land. The school&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Hershey Industrial School&quot; to &quot;Milton Hershey School&quot; in 1953, reportedly to eliminate the possibility of &quot;industrial&quot; connoting a reform school.

The school&#x27;s selection of students broadened in the 1960s and 70s. Following a 1968 decision upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ordered the racial desegregation of Girard College, Milton Hershey School admitted its first non-white student. School official James E. Bobb, however, stated that the decision to admit racial minorities was unrelated to the ruling. In 1976, the school expanded its definition of orphanhood to include &quot;social orphans&quot;, those with single or divorced parents. In November of that year, the school successfully petitioned the Dauphin County Court on allowing girls based on their charter. The first eight girls arrived in March 1977. Female admission was gradual, first restricted to those between kindergarten and fifth grade, then in the summer of 1977 to sixth through eighth grade, and finally to all grade divisions in the summer of 1978. In October 1977, approximately 1100 boys and 60 girls were enrolled in the school; by September 1978, female students made up 10% of the 1300 students.

Cyndi Jacobsen wrote in 1989 in &quot;The Sentinel&quot; that &quot;students chafe under the rules, the lack of privacy and individuality, and the anachronistic dairy barns ... [b]ut graduates tend to look back at their experience as a survival test&quot;. She said that house parents varied widely in their treatment, with some &quot;rigid and authoritarian&quot; and others &quot;warm and affirming.&quot; Later that year, the school&#x27;s longtime tradition of requiring all grade 9–12 students to milk cows, twice daily, was rescinded, with strong approval from students and the board. Director of secondary education John Storm justified the change, stating that &quot;the school revolved around the milking program, when in fact we wanted it to revolve around educational opportunities&quot;.

In 2002, the school had about 1,500 students; over the next two decades, the school grew to about 2,000 students.

In 2010, the school settled in a molestation case involving sixteen children. In late 2011, a 13 year old was denied admission to the school because he was HIV-positive. While the school initially defended its decision, citing safety concerns, an anti-discrimination lawsuit filed by the AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania led to a settlement of $700,000 for the boy&#x27;s family and a reversal of the policy.

In 2013, 14-year-old student Abbie Bartels committed suicide shortly after being denied attendance at the school&#x27;s eighth-grade graduation. While the family brought a lawsuit against the school, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit refused in early 2021 to revive the lawsuit, agreeing that the case was tragic but that the school could not be held responsible for her death.

In 2016, eleven former students sued the school for invasion of privacy, alleging that an employee had hidden a camera in a bathroom for senior male students. The employee admitted to filming the boys&#x27; showering and was sentenced to a year in prison.

That year, Milton Hershey School&#x27;s science curriculum supervisor Dr. Jaunine Fouche received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.

In 2017, the Law, Public Safety and Security program at Milton Hershey School was recognized as the Advance CTE National Program of Excellence. The school received its first accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) for its campus security. 

Also in 2017, former student Adam Dobson sued the school after the school expelled Dobson for attempting suicide. Dobson later stated that he was forced to watch a religious gay-conversion video. A court dismissed the lawsuit in 2020.

In 2019, Milton Hershey School&#x27;s elementary innovation lab instructor received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.
In 2020, Milton Hershey School received its second CALEA accreditation recognizing the school&#x27;s Central Monitoring staff for excellence in Public Safety Communications.

== Governance ==
===Finance===
Milton Hershey School&#x27;s endowment was worth around $15 billion in 2020, about half of which comes from the school&#x27;s controlling share of The Hershey Company&#x27;s stock; the school is the US&#x27;s wealthiest private school (besides universities and colleges). Only about 1.5% of this sum is used per year for educational programs, spending about $118,400 per year on each student. The proportionally low spending has been controversial. Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor John Core called it &quot;ludicrous&quot;, and Georgetown University law professor Brian Galle called it &quot;indefensibly low&quot;. Galle said the low spending was because the school &quot;can&#x27;t seem to conceivably find any way to spend this pile of money&quot;. School officials countered that the school must adhere to the spending limits of Hershey&#x27;s original deed.

In July 2002, the company managing the school trust announced it was considering selling its share in the Hershey company. Alumni and residents criticized the idea; some accused the trust of long-term financial wrongdoing and incompetence, with 1980 graduate Ric Fouad calling it &quot;the charitable-trust Enron&quot;.

In 2020, Milton Hershey School invested $350 million to fund the development of up to six cost-free early childhood resource centers in Pennsylvania. Named Catherine Hershey Schools for Early Learning, the first center opened in 2023, and they serve children from birth to age five from economically disadvantaged and at-risk backgrounds.

=== Partnerships ===
In 2017, Milton Hershey School created a partnership with Penn State University, its seventh such partnership to offer graduates of Milton Hershey School support at the college level as first-generation college students. Other similar partnerships are with Mansfield University, Shippensburg University, East Stroudsburg University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Millersville University. In 2018, they signed a similar agreement with Dickinson College.

== School structure ==
The school is split into three cohorts: pre-K through 4th grade, 5th through 8th grade, and 9th through 12th grade. , there are 180 student homes, each with 8 to 12 students of the same gender and similar age, and each led by house parents. Upon entering 5th grade, students begin the Career and Technical Education program, which provides activities tailored to students&#x27; specialized interests. The school offers college scholarships for some students and has special partnerships with about twenty colleges for student transitions. 85 to 90 percent of students continue to post-secondary education. In 2024, the school introduced ‘theme homes’ where high school students of similar interests live together and engage in experiential learning about potential career options.

== Admissions ==
According to the school&#x27;s website, students are admitted on five criteria: having a family income less than twice the federal poverty level, being age 4 to 15, having an IQ over 80, lacking serious behavioral problems, and being able to &quot;benefit from the school&#x27;s program&quot;. The school is cost-free for students. , 73 percent of students are from the state of Pennsylvania. The acceptance rate is low, around 14% in 1991. Each year, an average of 12.5% of the student population leaves, mostly by graduating or being removed by their parents. A quarter to a third of departures are expulsions.

=== Demographics ===
The school housed 2,020 students in the 2017–18 school year. Of these, 44.5% were white, 33.8% were black, 8.7% were Hispanic, 1.0% were Asian, and 11.0% identified with two or more races. There were 395 students in pre-K through 4th grade, 545 students in grades 5–8, and 950 students in grades 10–12. According to the school&#x27;s website, there are roughly an equal number of boys and girls. While in 2000 only about one tenth of students had a deceased parent, nearly 90 percent of the school&#x27;s come from single-parent homes as of 2020, with an average income of $22,000.


The Compass Project enables Milton Hershey School students to develop leadership skills and build character. The school&#x27;s Multicultural and Global Education program allows high school students to travel internationally and gain worldly experience and global awareness.

Non-sectarian Christian religious training has been mandatory since the school&#x27;s beginning. School guidelines prohibit pressuring students to convert faiths; some students, however, have reported being proselytized by their house parents.
== Campus ==
The school&#x27;s address is 1201 Homestead Lane, Hershey, Pennsylvania, just off U.S. Highway 322. , the school trust owns of land, about of which are school campuses. Of the eight campuses, the main campus is by far the largest at 3,340 acres.

<text>Tony Clifton is a character created by comedian and performance artist Andy Kaufman in the late 1970s. An absurdly foul-mouthed and domineering lounge singer claiming to hail from Las Vegas, the tuxedo-clad Clifton often led unsuspecting audiences through awkward yet elaborate lounge singer performances. Kaufman appeared as Clifton on stage and on television programs ranging from &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; to &quot;The Fantastic Miss Piggy Show&quot;. 

The character has also been performed on stage by longtime Kaufman friend Bob Zmuda. Clifton was portrayed by actor Jim Carrey (who also portrayed Kaufman) in the 1999 film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; and in the documentary &quot;Jim &amp; Andy: The Great Beyond&quot;.

==Origin==
Kaufman would sometimes claim that Tony Clifton was a real lounge singer whom Kaufman encountered at the International Hotel in Las Vegas in 1969. He said he was waiting for Elvis Presley to arrive so he could meet him. Kaufman may have seen Clifton as the antithesis of the sweet, gentle &quot;Foreign Man&quot; character he was best known for (which was later adapted into Latka Gravas, Kaufman&#x27;s character on &quot;Taxi&quot;).

Clifton would often attempt to improvise comical lyrics that were intentionally unfunny before giving up entirely without seeming to care. Clifton also tended to randomly insult patrons, passing off the abuse as the &quot;comedy&quot; portion of his act. Adding to Clifton&#x27;s annoying and unappealing presence was his tendency to rhyme various words at random in the middle of conversations. Clifton was often introduced as having &quot;sold more records than Elvis and The Beatles combined.&quot;

For a brief time, it was unclear to some whether Clifton was a real person. News programs interviewed Clifton as Kaufman&#x27;s opening act, but the interviews invariably would turn ugly whenever Kaufman&#x27;s name came up. Clifton claimed Kaufman was using his name &quot;to go places.&quot; Promoters who thought they had caught on to the joke would hire Clifton because he was cheaper than booking Kaufman. However, Kaufman had the last laugh, enlisting his brother Michael or his showbiz partner Bob Zmuda to play the role, with Kaufman making unannounced appearances on stage during Clifton&#x27;s act.

Rodney Dangerfield was a big fan of Andy Kaufman, and he hired Clifton to open for him for two shows at Bill Graham&#x27;s venue Fillmore West. After a disastrous first show, where Clifton took the stage with Tony Bennett&#x27;s famous &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot; and was summarily booed, he reappeared on the second night in riot gear amid a shower of rotten vegetables and other detritus.

Tony Clifton still makes occasional appearances, most notably in the days leading up to May 16, 2004, the twentieth anniversary of Kaufman&#x27;s death. It was announced on May 16, 2008, that Comic Relief, in recognition of the 24th anniversary of Andy Kaufman&#x27;s death, would present &quot;The Return of Tony Clifton&quot;, with his &quot;Katrina Kiss My Ass Orchestra&quot;. The national tour kicked off on June 27, 2008, at the Georgia Theatre in Athens, Georgia, to benefit Gulf Coast musicians, dancers, and singers affected by Hurricane Katrina. Clifton fronted the Katrina Orchestra along with the Cliftonettes. On August 15 they were at Chicago&#x27;s Chopin Theatre. In May 2011, they were featured headliners as part of the annual Hangout Music Festival in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Later that month he began hosting the &quot;Tony Clifton Revue&quot; at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles. He was interviewed on May 31, 2012, at the 284th episode of Marc Maron&#x27;s podcast &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot;.

==Television==

===&quot;Taxi&quot;===
Clifton was hired to appear on an early episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Taxi&quot;. In 1977, the producers of &quot;Taxi&quot; saw Kaufman&#x27;s Foreign Man act at The Comedy Store and offered him a role in their show based on the character. Kaufman was not a fan of sitcoms, but his manager, George Shapiro, convinced him that this would propel him to stardom, where he would make a lot of money, which he could then put into his act, which became &quot;Andy&#x27;s Funhouse&quot;. Kaufman agreed to appear as Latka Gravas in 14 episodes per season, approximately half of the entire series if Tony Clifton was also allowed to guest star in the series. The producers were well aware that &quot;Clifton&quot; was an alter ego of Kaufman but went along with the fiction that Clifton was a separate actor. They signed Clifton to a separate contract and announced to the cast that Clifton was being hired to portray the brother of Danny DeVito&#x27;s character Louie De Palma in the series 13th episode.

However, after the first day of rehearsal, the producers felt Kaufman as Clifton was not up to the acting challenge of playing the offered role. Informed of this, Kaufman asked that &quot;Clifton&quot; be fired in public, ostensibly for coming to rehearsal late. Clifton reappeared on set for the next day of filming and was demanding, boorish and obnoxious. The producers not only fired Clifton in front of the press and network executives (who had gathered on set to witness the promised spectacle) but threw him off the set after he caused havoc and enraged series stars Judd Hirsch and Jeff Conaway. The role was hurriedly recast, and when Kaufman (as himself) returned to work for the following episode, he acted as if nothing had happened.

Sam Simon, a season 5 writer and showrunner for &quot;Taxi&quot;, said in a 2013 interview with Marc Maron for the &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot; podcast that the story of Kaufman (as opposed to &quot;Tony Clifton&quot;) having generally been disruptive on the show was &quot;a complete fiction&quot; created mainly by Bob Zmuda. Simon maintained that Zmuda has a &quot;vested interest&quot; in promoting an out-of-control image of Kaufman. In the interview, Simon stated that Kaufman was &quot;completely professional&quot; and that he &quot;told you Tony Clifton was him&quot;, but he also conceded that Kaufman would have &quot;loved&quot; Zmuda&#x27;s version of events. However, while many &quot;Taxi&quot; staffers have corroborated the story that Clifton was a disruptive presence during his brief time on set in the first season, Simon himself had no association with &quot;Taxi&quot; until its third season, so he did not witness this specific event.

===Other appearances===
Clifton (played by Zmuda) appeared once on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, where he was interviewed and sang a medley with the band. In 1982, Clifton also appeared on &quot;The Fantastic Miss Piggy Show&quot; as the host&#x27;s &quot;new discovery,&quot; although the other Muppets and host George Hamilton remained skeptical of Clifton&#x27;s talent.

Perhaps the biggest myth surrounding Tony Clifton&#x27;s TV appearances comes from Dinah Shore&#x27;s daytime talk show &quot;Dinah &amp; Friends&quot;. According to legend, Clifton arrived for the taping drunk and then pressured Shore in front of the studio audience to sing a duet with him although he had been previously told that she had a sore throat. This was a prearranged bit which featured messages from the producers telling the viewers at home that this was a &quot;put on&quot;. The myth continues that, after dumping eggs on Shore&#x27;s head, the show&#x27;s producers quickly cut to a commercial as Clifton was escorted out of the studio, and the videotape of the incident was &quot;destroyed&quot;. In reality, the footage has been lost, and the entire event was staged, as with all of Kaufman&#x27;s appearances.

Clifton was also a heckler on &quot;The Green Room with Paul Provenza&quot; and was escorted out of the room.

In 2009, Clifton appeared on &quot;The Opie &amp; Anthony Show&quot; to promote a performance at Santos Party House in New York City.

==In other media==
===Films===
====Tony Clifton biopic====
Kaufman and Zmuda wrote a screenplay for a Tony Clifton biography. However, the plan was sidelined after the box office failure of Kaufman&#x27;s first major motion picture &quot;Heartbeeps&quot;, in which he co-starred with Bernadette Peters as a robot who falls in love. In the screenplay Clifton dies at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles from cancer. Five years later, Kaufman died at the same hospital from lung cancer.

====&quot;Man on the Moon&quot;====
Clifton is portrayed in the Kaufman biographical film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, credited as &quot;Himself&quot;.

==Influence==
Kaufman&#x27;s Tony Clifton character has influenced other &quot;anti-comedy&quot; acts, notably standup comedian Neil Hamburger and singer/comedian Unknown Hinson. Maren Ade&#x27;s Toni Erdmann, the protagonist in the 2016 Oscar-nominated German movie of the same title, was influenced by Kaufman concerning appearance, humor and first name.

<text>The Justice League, or Justice League of America (JLA), is a group of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The team first appeared in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #28 (March 1960). Writer Gardner Fox conceived the team as a revival of the Justice Society of America, a similar team from DC Comics from the 1940s which had been pulled out of print due to a decline in sales. The Justice League is an all-star ensemble cast of established superhero characters from DC Comics&#x27; portfolio. Diegetically, these superheroes usually operate independently but occasionally assemble as a team to tackle especially formidable villains. This is in contrast to certain other superhero teams such as Doom Patrol or Marvel’s X-Men whose characters were created specifically to be part of the team, with the team being central to their identity. The cast of the Justice League usually features a few highly popular characters who have their own solo books, such as Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, alongside several lesser-known characters who benefit from exposure.

The Justice League was created to boost the profiles and sales of said characters through cross-promotion and helped develop the DC Universe as a shared universe, as it is through teams like the Justice League that the setting&#x27;s characters regularly interact with each other.

Beyond comic books, the Justice League has been adapted to television shows, films, and video games.

==Publication history==
Since 1960, the Justice League has appeared in comic books published by DC Comics (periodicals and graphic novels). These comic books constitute the bulk of Justice League fiction.

===Silver Age and Bronze Age (1960–1984)===

In its inception, the Justice League was a revival of the Justice Society of America, created by editor Sheldon Mayer and writer Gardner Fox in 1940. After World War II, superheroes fell out of popularity, which led to the cancellation of many characters, including the Justice Society, which last appeared in &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; #57 (March 1951). A few years later, sales rose again, and DC Comics revived some of these retired characters, reinventing a few of them in the process. Editor Julius Schwartz asked writer Gardner Fox to reintroduce the Justice Society of America. Schwartz decided to rename it the &quot;Justice League of America&quot; because he felt &quot;League&quot; would appeal better to young readers, evoking sports organizations such as the National League. The Justice League of America debuted in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #28 (March 1960), and after two further appearances in that title, got its own series, which quickly became one of the company&#x27;s best-selling titles. This led DC Comics to create a bunch of other superhero teams, such as the Teen Titans. Marvel Comics, a rival comic book publisher, noticed the Justice League&#x27;s success and created the Avengers and the Fantastic Four.

The initial Justice League lineup included seven of DC Comics&#x27; superheroes who were regularly published at that time: Superman, Batman, Aquaman, the Flash, Green Lantern, the Martian Manhunter, and Wonder Woman. Fox also created a new, non-superhero character called Snapper Carr that was intended to represent DC&#x27;s teenage readership and joined the League as an Honorary member in their debut story. While Superman and Batman were included in the Justice League&#x27;s initial lineup, they were largely absent from the League&#x27;s early stories, playing only minor roles as the pair were already starring together in DC&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; and Fox was worried the two more famous heroes would detract attention from their less popular teammates. As the series went on however, Superman and Batman became more and more present as readers increasingly demanded to see more of them in the League&#x27;s stories. The team roster would quickly expand with the Green Arrow, the Atom and Hawkman being added to the team over the next four years.

In the Justice Society stories from the 1940s (in &quot;All-Star Comics&quot;), the Justice Society was used more as a framing device for its members&#x27; solo adventures. The stories tended to have the following structure: the Justice Society meets to discuss some new menace, they split up to undertake individual missions that somehow connect to said menace, and finally regroup for the showdown with the main villain. In the 1940s, most comic books were anthologies, and &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; was in practice not a major deviation from that. By contrast, the Justice League worked together more closely in their stories, thereby having a stronger identity as a team.

In another change from the Justice Society stories of the 1940s, Batman and Superman were regular members of the cast, not mere &quot;honorary members&quot; who made occasional cameos.

&quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 1) #21 (August 1963) featured the first crossover story in which the Justice League meets and teams up with the Justice Society of America. In doing so, DC Comics brought back a number of legacy characters such as Doctor Fate and the Black Canary. The issue was a hit with readers and such crossovers became a recurring event.

&quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 1) was published from 1960 to 1987.

===Detroit era (1984–1986)===
From the Justice League&#x27;s inception in 1960 up until 1984, the team&#x27;s roster always included a number of A-list characters to draw in readers, such as Wonder Woman and Superman. But in &quot;Justice League of America Annual&quot; #2 (October 1984), the Justice League was revised to entirely comprise more obscure characters such as Vixen, Vibe, and the Martian Manhunter. The original A-list members would not be brought back into the cast until 1996. The motives behind this change were to dispense with the convoluted continuities of the classic characters by using lesser-known and new characters, thus giving the writers more flexibility to write character-driven stories; and to give the team a more youthful, hipper feel similar to that of the Teen Titans and the X-Men, which were selling better. The cast was multicultural: Gypsy was Romani, Vibe was Latino, Vixen was Black. However, the writing of Vibe and Gypsy was criticized for using clichés of their ethnic groups, symptomatic of writers who were well-meaning but out of touch, something for which said writers (Gerry Conway and Chuck Patton) later expressed regret. This era of the Justice League, which lasted about two years, is popularly known as &quot;Justice League Detroit&quot; because they were headquartered in Detroit.

===&quot;Justice League International&quot; and its spin-offs (1986–1996)===

The 1986 company-wide crossover &quot;Legends&quot; concluded with the formation of a new Justice League. The new team was dubbed the &quot;Justice League,&quot; then &quot;Justice League International&quot; (JLI) and was given a mandate with less of an American focus. The Justice League International was recognized by the United Nations as a political entity and established &quot;embassies&quot; all over the world. The new series was character-driven and had a quirky, humorous tone which proved popular with readers. Numerous spin-off teams such as &quot;Justice League Europe&quot;, &quot;Extreme Justice&quot;, and &quot;Justice League Task Force&quot; were created. In 1996, these series were cancelled due to low sales.

The Justice League International featured characters that had previously not been part of the DC Universe, which had been absorbed from the portfolios of other publishers that DC Comics had purchased. These included Captain Atom and the Blue Beetle, which were created for Charlton Comics in the 1960s. In 1983, DC Comics purchased Charlton Comics and, a few years later, integrated the Blue Beetle and Captain Atom into the DC Universe. Captain Marvel, originally from the Fawcett Comics universe, was similarly integrated.

===&quot;JLA&quot; (1996–2006)===
The cancellation of the aforementioned spin-off books prompted DC to revamp the League as a single team in a single title. A new Justice League of America was launched in a September 1996 miniseries &quot;Justice League: A Midsummer&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; by Mark Waid and Fabian Nicieza, which returned to the classic cast. In 1997, DC Comics launched a new book titled &quot;JLA&quot;. Grant Morrison wrote &quot;JLA&quot; for the first four years, and they gave the book an epic feel by making the Justice League an allegory for a pantheon of gods, and in their stories they regularly fought villains who threatened the entire world or even the entire cosmos. The ongoing series began its monthly run in January 1997, and concluded in April 2006 after 126 issues.

This series utilized a &quot;back-to-basics&quot; approach by shifting the focus back on the team&#x27;s original and most famous seven members (or their successors): Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, the Flash (Wally West), Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), and the Martian Manhunter. Additionally, the team received a new headquarters, the &quot;Watchtower&quot;, based on the Moon. &quot;JLA&quot; quickly became DC&#x27;s best-selling title, a position it enjoyed on and off for several years.

===Volume 2 (2006–2011)===
The Justice League books more or less continued the trend set by the &quot;JLA&quot; era: world-shaking threats with epic stakes, with a focus on plot over character development, and strong tie-ins to all the company&#x27;s crossover events. In 2006, DC began an ongoing comic series titled &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 2).

===New 52 (2011–2016)===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; era, further changes to the retroactive continuity of the DC Universe were made, such as Cyborg, one of DC&#x27;s premier African American heroes, becoming a founding member of the team. In 2011, DC Comics also released a spin-off title called &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;, which is an ensemble team of prominent magic users of the DC Universe, such as John Constantine, Zatanna, Madame Xanadu, and Swamp Thing.

===DC Rebirth (2016–2017)===
===New Justice (2018–2021)===
In the New Justice era, the fourth volume of the Justice League begins its run, and continues into the following Infinite Frontier era.

A connected new title &quot;Justice League: No Justice&quot; emerged and ran for 4 issues, taking place shortly after &quot;Dark Nights: Metal.&quot; Furthering focus on the aftermath is a following title called &quot;Justice League Odyssey&quot; that established its 25-issue run from 2018 to 2020. Continuing to deal with the concerns of the Source Wall being broken, Cyborg, Starfire, Green Lantern Jessica Cruz, and Azrael find themselves being lured by Darkseid into a newly inhabited area in outer space named the Ghost Sector. The title was created by Scott Snyder, Joshua Williamson, James Tynion IV and Francis Manapul.

A second volume of Justice League Dark was announced, and ran regularly for 29 issues from July 2018 to February 2021. Being led by Wonder Woman, the team members include John Constantine, Zatanna, Swamp Thing, Man-Bat, Detective Chimp, Doctor Fate, and briefly Animal Man.

===Infinite Frontier (2021–2023)===

The fourth volume of the definitive &quot;Justice League&quot; title continues well into the &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; era and reaches a conclusion with a total of 75 issues in June 2022. Despite not having a title run during the &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; era, the team from &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; would continue to appear as a backup feature in the mainline &quot;Justice League&quot; series during the &quot;Dark Crisis&quot; story arc, from issue #59 in May 2021 to issue #71 in March 2022, with guest appearances throughout issues #72 to 74.

Also sharing a tie to &quot;Dark Crises&quot; is &quot;Justice League Incarnate&quot;. Consisting of a different team, the 5-issue title shortly ran from January 2022 to May 2022 Some pivotal members are Superman of Earth 23, Flashpoint Batman, Mary Marvel of Earth 5, Captain Carrot of Earth 26, among others, including their own Flash, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, plus a new character by the name of Doctor Multiverse.

===Dawn of DC (2023–2024)===
With the end of &quot;Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the Justice League was brought back from the dead. This has now inspired Amanda Waller, now working under &quot;The Light&quot;, to take action against all metahumans, as she believes that they have become too powerful. Waller tasked Peacemaker, her new right hand, in the goal of getting the Helmet of Hate. While Peacemaker was off on his mission, Waller met up with a group of villains giving them a new task, which is to kill superheroes.

With the &quot;Justice League&quot; going on hiatus as a team, the Titans step forward to become the DC universe&#x27;s premier superhero team, with Nightwing being the leader. The Titans are now located in Blüdhaven with their new Titans Tower being rebuilt over an old prison, which was destroyed following a prison breakout, led by the villain Heartless.

===DC All In (2024-Present)===

For DC&#x27;s DC All-In aimed at providing a jumping on point for new readers, a new Justice League series &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; debut, written by Mark Waid and illustrated by Dan Mora. The premise of the new series is that following &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, the superhero community has enlisted the majority of the world&#x27;s heroes as Justice League members, stationed together in a new Watchtower orbiting Earth and dispatching heroes to counter threats. The main team comprises Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Atom (Ryan Choi), Black Lightning, Star Sapphire, Green Lantern, and many others.

===Inter-company crossovers===
The Justice League has on a few occasions appeared in crossover stories with superhero characters from rival publishers such as Marvel Comics and Dark Horse Comics. In general, such inter-company crossovers are rare because a lot of resources must be spent in sorting out the legal issues and corporate politics of the two companies, and due to licensing issues, they cannot create spin-off merchandise and media, which all reduce the profitability of such projects.

The last crossover between DC Comics and Marvel Comics was &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;, which they jointly published in 2003. Now that Marvel Comics and DC Comics are part of major multimedia corporations (Disney and Warner Brothers, respectively), those aforementioned hurdles are even more complicated, which makes another project like &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; much less likely. In 2017, Dan Didio remarked that DC Comics and Marvel are very competitive toward each other and only did crossovers when their sales were low. However, DC Comics did go on to feature the Justice League in crossovers with smaller companies such as Dark Horse Comics, such as a crossover with &quot;Black Hammer&quot; in 2019.

==Fictional history==
===Members===

The members of the Justice League are heroes who normally operate independently but who occasionally team up to tackle especially formidable villains. This is in contrast to teams such as the X-Men or the Fantastic Four, who normally operate as a team and for whom the team is central to their identity.

Most versions of the Justice League feature a select cast of highly popular characters from the DC Comics portfolio, such as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, to attract readers with their star power; and they often co-feature a few lesser-known characters who benefit from exposure, such as Cyborg or Black Canary. DC Comics has in several periods deviated from this formula, most notably in the late 1980s and early 1990s with books such as &quot;Justice League International&quot;, which deliberately featured a cast of lesser-known characters. The advantage of this was that lesser-known characters are not burdened by convoluted continuities, which gave writers more creative flexibility to write character-driven stories. This was done to emulate the model of Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;X-Men&quot; comic books, whose stories were more character-driven and which favored more obscure or new characters.

The Justice League is an independent group, although it usually accepts some constraints from the U.S. government or the United Nations so as to receive their sanction. Particularly in the early decades of publication, DC Comics was keen for its superheroes to be perceived as law-abiding because children were the main audience. The cast is rarely more than a dozen people in size so as to give a reasonable and equal time for each character. While sometimes the League is shown to have a designated chairperson or leader, there is otherwise no hierarchy; they are a small band of equals who make major decisions, such as inducting new members, by vote.

===Headquarters===
The Justice League operates out of a headquarters. In the 1960s, their headquarters was secretly in a hollowed-out mountain outside the fictional town of Happy Harbor in Rhode Island. In &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #78 (1970), they moved to a satellite. In the &quot;Super Friends&quot; cartoons which ran from 1973 to 1985, they operated out of the Hall of Justice located in Washington, D.C. During the brief &quot;Justice League Detroit&quot; era, they were headquartered in a repurposed bomb shelter in Detroit. In the &quot;JLA&quot; comic book which ran from 1997 to 2006, their headquarters was on the Moon and called &quot;the Watchtower&quot;. The centerpiece of the headquarters is a conference table around which the Justice League discusses menaces to deal with. The satellite and Moon base headquarters are equipped with teleporters for those members who cannot fly to it.

===Villains===
The Legion of Doom was created for the &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; animated TV series as a villainous counterpart to the Justice League. In that original incarnation, it consisted of established villains associated with each of the Justice League&#x27;s members; e.g., Lex Luthor for Superman, Joker for Batman, Sinestro for the Green Lantern, Black Manta for the Aquaman, Gorilla Grodd for the Flash, and the Cheetah for Wonder Woman. The Legion of Doom, or some variant of it, has since appeared in other TV shows and comic books.

==Cultural impact==
Most of the characters that appear in DC Comics&#x27; books are set in the same fictional universe, known as the DC Universe. They occasionally make guest appearances in each other&#x27;s solo books, and more regularly in team books such as &quot;Justice League&quot;. Such crossovers encouraged readers to buy other books in the DC Comics catalogue, and readers became engrossed not just in the individual characters but in their web of relationships across the broader setting, thereby building brand loyalty. Marvel Comics copied this idea by creating a number of superhero teams of its own, the closest analogue being the Avengers, so as to promote and develop the Marvel Universe. Some readers focused their attention on just one of these two comic book universes, as they were both large and did not overlap. Thus, the superhero fandom developed sub-communities of DC devotees and Marvel devotees.

==Awards==
The original &quot;Justice League of America&quot; series won two 1961 Alley Awards in the categories &quot;Best Comic Book&quot; and &quot;Best Adventure-Hero Group.&quot; In 1963, the series won &quot;Favorite Novel&quot; (&quot;Crisis on Earth-One/Crisis on Earth-Two&quot; in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #21–22 by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky) and &quot;Strip that Should Be Improved.&quot; There also an award specific to the series, &quot;Artist Preferred on &quot;Justice League of America&quot;,&quot; that was won by Murphy Anderson.

&quot;Justice League: Battle for Metropolis&quot; is an interactive dark ride at seven Six Flags parks across the United States and Mexico. In the ride, Lex Luthor and the Joker have captured Supergirl, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and Flash, and it is up to the combined forces of the remaining members of the Justice League and the Justice League Reserve Team to save them from their capture at LexCorp. Guests board motion-enhanced and stun blaster-equipped vehicles designed by A.R.G.U.S. as they ride through Metropolis and join the fight against the henchmen of Lex Luthor and the Joker.

<doc id="99945" wikidata="Q734209" url="?curid=99945" title="Generating set of a group">
<text>In abstract algebra, a generating set of a group is a subset of the group set such that every element of the group can be expressed as a combination (under the group operation) of finitely many elements of the subset and their inverses.

In other words, if formula_1 is a subset of a group formula_2, then formula_3, the &quot;subgroup generated by formula_1&quot;, is the smallest subgroup of formula_2 containing every element of formula_1, which is equal to the intersection over all subgroups containing the elements of formula_1; equivalently, formula_3 is the subgroup of all elements of formula_2 that can be expressed as the finite product of elements in formula_1 and their inverses. (Note that inverses are only needed if the group is infinite; in a finite group, the inverse of an element can be expressed as a power of that element.)

If formula_11, then we say that formula_1 &quot;generates&quot; formula_2, and the elements in formula_1 are called &quot;generators&quot; or &quot;group generators&quot;. If formula_1 is the empty set, then formula_3 is the trivial group formula_17, since we consider the empty product to be the identity.

When there is only a single element formula_18 in formula_1, formula_3 is usually written as formula_21. In this case, formula_21 is the &quot;cyclic subgroup&quot; of the powers of formula_18, a cyclic group, and we say this group is generated by formula_18. Equivalent to saying an element formula_18 generates a group is saying that formula_21 equals the entire group formula_2. For finite groups, it is also equivalent to saying that formula_18 has order formula_29.

A group may need an infinite number of generators. For example the additive group of rational numbers formula_30 is not finitely generated. It is generated by the inverses of all the integers, but any finite number of these generators can be removed from the generating set without it ceasing to be a generating set. In a case like this, all the elements in a generating set are nevertheless &quot;non-generating elements&quot;, as are in fact all the elements of the whole group − see Frattini subgroup below.

If formula_2 is a topological group then a subset formula_1 of formula_2 is called a set of &quot;topological generators&quot; if formula_3 is dense in formula_2, i.e. the closure of formula_3 is the whole group formula_2.

==Finitely generated group==

If formula_1 is finite, then a group formula_11 is called &quot;finitely generated&quot;. The structure of finitely generated abelian groups in particular is easily described. Many theorems that are true for finitely generated groups fail for groups in general. It has been proven that if a finite group is generated by a subset formula_1, then each group element may be expressed as a word from the alphabet formula_1 of length less than or equal to the order of the group.

Every finite group is finitely generated since formula_42. The integers under addition are an example of an infinite group which is finitely generated by both 1 and −1, but the group of rationals under addition cannot be finitely generated. No uncountable group can be finitely generated. For example, the group of real numbers under addition, formula_43.

Different subsets of the same group can be generating subsets. For example, if formula_44 and formula_45 are integers with , then formula_46 also generates the group of integers under addition by Bézout&#x27;s identity.

While it is true that every quotient of a finitely generated group is finitely generated (the images of the generators in the quotient give a finite generating set), a subgroup of a finitely generated group need not be finitely generated. For example, let formula_2 be the free group in two generators, formula_18 and formula_49 (which is clearly finitely generated, since formula_50), and let formula_1 be the subset consisting of all elements of formula_2 of the form formula_53 for some natural number formula_54. formula_3 is isomorphic to the free group in countably infinitely many generators, and so cannot be finitely generated. However, every subgroup of a finitely generated abelian group is in itself finitely generated. In fact, more can be said: the class of all finitely generated groups is closed under extensions. To see this, take a generating set for the (finitely generated) normal subgroup and quotient. Then the generators for the normal subgroup, together with preimages of the generators for the quotient, generate the group.

==Examples==
* The multiplicative group of integers modulo 9, , is the group of all integers relatively prime to 9 under multiplication . Note that 7 is not a generator of , since   formula_56 while 2 is, since   formula_57

* On the other hand, &quot;S&quot;n, the symmetric group of degree &quot;n&quot;, is not generated by any one element (is not cyclic) when &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2. However, in these cases &quot;S&quot;n can always be generated by two permutations which are written in cycle notation as (1 2) and . For example, the 6 elements of &quot;S&quot;3 can be generated from the two generators, (1 2) and (1 2 3), as shown by the right hand side of the following equations (composition is left-to-right):
:&quot;e&quot; = (1 2)(1 2)
:(1 2) = (1 2)
:(1 3) = (1 2)(1 2 3)
:(2 3) = (1 2 3)(1 2)
:(1 2 3) = (1 2 3)
:(1 3 2) = (1 2)(1 2 3)(1 2)

* Infinite groups can also have finite generating sets. The additive group of integers has 1 as a generating set. The element 2 is not a generating set, as the odd numbers will be missing. The two-element subset is a generating set, since (in fact, any pair of coprime numbers is, as a consequence of Bézout&#x27;s identity).

* The dihedral group of an n-gon (which has order ) is generated by the set , where represents rotation by and is any reflection across a line of symmetry.

* The cyclic group of order formula_54, formula_59, and the formula_54th roots of unity are all generated by a single element (in fact, these groups are isomorphic to one another).

* A presentation of a group is defined as a set of generators and a collection of relations between them, so any of the examples listed on that page contain examples of generating sets.

==Free group==

The most general group generated by a set formula_1 is the group freely generated by formula_1. Every group generated by formula_1 is isomorphic to a quotient of this group, a feature which is utilized in the expression of a group&#x27;s presentation.

==Frattini subgroup==
An interesting companion topic is that of &quot;non-generators&quot;. An element formula_18 of the group formula_2 is a non-generator if every set formula_1 containing formula_18 that generates formula_2, still generates formula_2 when formula_18 is removed from formula_1. In the integers with addition, the only non-generator is 0. The set of all non-generators forms a subgroup of formula_2, the Frattini subgroup.

==Semigroups and monoids==
If formula_2 is a semigroup or a monoid, one can still use the notion of a generating set formula_1 of formula_2. formula_1 is a semigroup/monoid generating set of formula_2 if formula_2 is the smallest semigroup/monoid containing formula_1. 

The definitions of generating set of a group using finite sums, given above, must be slightly modified when one deals with semigroups or monoids. Indeed, this definition should not use the notion of inverse operation anymore. The set formula_1 is said to be a semigroup generating set of formula_2 if each element of formula_2 is a finite sum of elements of formula_1. Similarly, a set formula_1 is said to be a monoid generating set of formula_2 if each non-zero element of formula_2 is a finite sum of elements of formula_1.

For example, {1} is a monoid generator of the set of natural numbers formula_88. The set {1} is also a semigroup generator of the positive natural numbers formula_89. However, the integer 0 can not be expressed as a (non-empty) sum of 1s, thus {1} is not a semigroup generator of the natural numbers. 

Similarly, while {1} is a group generator of the set of integers formula_90, {1} is not a monoid generator of the set of integers. Indeed, the integer −1 cannot be expressed as a finite sum of 1s.

<doc id="99948" wikidata="Q2724012" url="?curid=99948" title="Cabin Boy">
<text>Cabin Boy is a 1994 American fantasy comedy film directed by Adam Resnick, co-produced by Tim Burton, and starring comedian Chris Elliott. Elliott co-wrote the film with Resnick. Both Elliott and Resnick worked for &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; in the 1980s as well as co-creating the Fox sitcom &quot;Get a Life&quot; in the early 1990s.

==Plot==
Nathaniel Mayweather is a snobbish, self-centered, arrogant, virginal &quot;fancy lad.&quot; After graduation, he is invited by his father to sail to Hawaii aboard &quot;The Queen Catherine&quot;. After annoying the limousine driver who is taking him to board the boat, he is forced to walk the rest of the way.

Nathaniel makes a wrong turn into a small fishing village where he meets the imbecilic cabin boy/first mate Kenny of &quot;The Filthy Whore&quot;, which Nathaniel believes to be &quot;The&quot; &quot;Queen Catherine&quot; as part of a theme. The next morning, Captain Greybar finds Nathaniel in his room and explains that the boat will not return to dry land for three months. Nathaniel unsuccessfully tries to convince each fisherman to set sail to Hawaii, but convinces Kenny into doing so. However, the crew reaches Hell&#x27;s Bucket&quot;,&quot; a Bermuda Triangle-like area where strange events occur. The ship is caught in a fierce storm and Kenny is knocked overboard and drowns. With only one island in the entire area, the crew decide to set sail there. Without a cabin boy, Greybar forces Nathaniel to do the chores in return for taking him to Hawaii, as well as teaching him how to become a better person.

After failing all the chores he is assigned, the fishermen decide to give Nathaniel another chore that involves dragging him on a floating raft for a week. Nathaniel quickly runs out of supplies, begins consuming salt water, and suffers extreme sunburn after confusing cooking oil as lotion. He also realizes he might be going insane after sighting Kenny&#x27;s ghost and seeing a floating cupcake that spits tobacco. After falling into the water he is saved by a shark-man. After nine days, Nathaniel is pulled back in and tells what happened. It is revealed by Skunk and Big Teddy that the shark-man is known as Chocki, the offspring of a male viking and female shark.

Nathaniel spots a beautiful young woman named Trina swimming in the ocean. After she is pulled up in a net, Nathaniel becomes smitten with her. Not pleased with another passenger on board, the fishermen decide to strand Trina and Nathaniel on the island they&#x27;re sailing toward. Finally reaching the island, the crew searches for components to fix their boat. Nathaniel tries to get closer to Trina, who constantly rejects him.

Greybar and Skunk suggest to Nathaniel that a blue-skinned, six-armed woman named Calli can help build his confidence. After an encounter with Calli that results in his first sexual experience, Nathaniel again meets Trina, who becomes attracted to him immediately. Calli&#x27;s husband Mulligan, a giant, comes home to find a man&#x27;s bag. Realizing what Calli has done, Mulligan decides to find her lover and kill him. Nathaniel tries to save everyone by confessing to the giant he&#x27;s the one who slept with Calli. Mulligan is about to kill Nathaniel with a giant nail clipper when Chocki saves him. Nathaniel then kills Mulligan by choking him with his own belt.

Finally reaching Hawaii, Nathaniel offers his newfound companions a job at the hotel where his father is the owner, which they refuse. They tell Nathaniel he&#x27;s a fancy lad who should stay in Hawaii with his dad where he belongs. Nathaniel and the fishermen part ways, including Trina. His equally-snobbish father, William Mayweather, condemns his son&#x27;s actions. Seeing through his father how snobbish he used to be before boarding &quot;The Filthy Whore&quot;, Nathaniel discards his wig and leaves to find Trina. They then both join the crew on &quot;The Filthy Whore&quot;.

Post-hardcore band A Static Lullaby reference the film in their song &quot;Half Man, Half Shark; Equals One Complete Gentleman&quot;, the title of which is a paraphrase of an Elliott line spoken in the film. The song can be found on their &quot;Faso Latido&quot; album.

David Letterman has a small cameo in this film, at the time his only big screen credit in which he wasn&#x27;t playing himself. For many years, whenever discussing Hollywood topics on &quot;The Late Show&quot;, he would cite his cameo in &quot;Cabin Boy&quot; as the sum of his relevant experience.

<text>Salvinia molesta, commonly known as giant salvinia, or as kariba weed after it infested a large portion of Lake Kariba between Zimbabwe and Zambia, is an aquatic fern, native to south-eastern Brazil. It is a free-floating plant that does not attach to the soil, but instead remains buoyant on the surface of a body of water. The fronds are 0.5–4 cm long and broad, with a bristly surface caused by the hair-like strands that join at the end to form eggbeater shapes. They are used to provide a waterproof covering. These fronds are produced in pairs also with a third modified root-like frond that hangs in the water. It has been accidentally introduced or escaped to countless lakes throughout the United States, including Caddo Lake in Texas, where the invasive species has done extensive damage, killing off other life.

In Europe, &quot;Salvinia molesta&quot; has been included since 2019 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). This implies that this species cannot be imported, cultivated, transported, commercialized, planted, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.

==Description==
&quot;Salvinia molesta&quot; is a complex of closely related floating ferns; they can be difficult to distinguish from each other. This water fern is often grown as an ornamental plant but has escaped and become a noxious pest in many regions worldwide. There are a few different growth forms for &quot;S. molesta&quot;. The primary growth form is an invading form with small flat leaves to the tertiary or mat form with large, crowded, folded leaves. Under the best conditions plants can form a two-foot-thick mat. These mats can put a halt to recreational activities on lakes and waterways. &quot;S. molesta&quot; has been used to extract nutrients and pollutants from the water. When this plant is dried out, it is used as satisfactory mulch.

== Favored environmental conditions ==
&quot;Salvinia molesta&quot; prefers to grow in slow-moving waters such as those found in lakes, ponds, billabongs (oxbows), streams, ditches, marshes, and rivers. It prefers nutrient-rich waters such as those found in eutrophic water or those polluted by waste water. It does not usually grow in brackish or salty waters, but has been reported in streams with a tidal flow in southeast Texas. It copes well with dewatering, and while it prefers to grow in moderate temperatures, it will tolerate low or very high temperatures. The United States Geological Service believes that it could grow in zones 7a, 8, 9, and 10 of the USDA Plant Hardiness Map.

==Effects of environmental conditions==
Environmental conditions can have a strong effect on this plant. &quot;S. molesta&quot; can survive on a mud bank for a short period of time, but because of the dry conditions, it cannot live there permanently. It grows best at a pH of 6–7.7 and at a water temperature of 20–30 °C. Growth can be increased in high light intensities. &quot;S. molesta&quot; cannot grow in high salt concentrations; the increase in salt causes a decrease in chlorophyll.

== Methods of introduction ==
The plant originated in southeast Brazil and was exported as part of the pet industry to be used in aquaria and garden ponds. From there, it escaped or was deliberately released into the wild. It may also have been brought in with fresh, iced fish. Once in a waterway, it can be spread by infested boats, which not only spread it to new areas, but also break up the plant, allowing it to propagate. It also is spread by waterfowl. &quot;S. molesta&quot; has been spread by contaminated aquatic plant stocks, boats, and other watercraft. The movement of water spreads &quot;S. molesta&quot;, and the sale and exchange of &quot;S. molesta&quot; materials increases chances of release to the environment.

== Potential use for cleaning water pollution ==
Research done in the Philippines suggested the effectiveness of &quot;S. molesta&quot; for the treatment of blackwater effluent for an eco-friendly sewage system that uses a constructed wetland to clean the water. The result of the study showed that it can remove 30.77% of total suspended solids, 74.70% dissolved oxygen and 48.95% fecal coliform from the water.

==Distribution==
The Brazilian floating fern known as &quot;Salvinia molesta&quot; is now widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas. This floating fern is known for its capability to take over large bodies of slow-moving fresh water. &quot;S. molesta&quot; has been naturalized in Texas and Louisiana, but has now also been found and reported in Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and Georgia. It can also be found where the lower Colorado River borders Arizona and California. &quot;While &quot;S. molesta&quot; rapidly colonizes new states, current populations are too small to assess, but have been targeted for eradication&quot;. The naturalized regions of Texas have 14 drainage basins that contain infested water bodies; these are used as impoundments on tributaries that flow near federally protected wetlands. In October 2020 Texas Parks and Wildlife detected &quot;S. molesta&quot; on Lone Star Lake while surveying fish populations.

== Reproduction ==
It reproduces by asexual reproduction only, but it is capable of growing extremely quickly, starting from small fragments and doubling in dry weight every 2.2–2.5 days. It grows from fragments that have broken off or dormant buds that have been detached from the main plant. Each node has five buds, so potential for great and rapid spread is high. It also produces spores, but they are genetically defective and do not produce viable offspring.

== Effect ==
The rapid growth rate of &quot;Salvinia molesta&quot; has resulted in its classification as an invasive weed in some parts of the world such as Australia, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and parts of the United States. Surfaces of ponds, reservoirs, and lakes are covered by a floating mat 10–20 cm (in some rare cases up to 60 cm) thick. The plant&#x27;s growth clogs waterways and blocks sunlight needed by other aquatic plants and especially algae to carry out photosynthesis, thereby deoxygenating the water. As it dies and decays, decomposers use up the oxygen in the water. It also prevents the natural exchange of gases between the air and the body of water the plant has invaded, causing the waterway to stagnate. This can kill any plants, insects, or fish trapped underneath its growth.

Its ability to grow and cover a vast area makes it a threat to biodiversity. Large infestations covering a wide area may also pose a problem to migratory birds, as they may not be able to recognise an infested waterway when flying overhead, so may not stop at it. &quot;S. molesta&quot; provides ideal conditions for the breeding of mosquitoes that carry disease. The growth habit of &quot;Salvinia&quot; is problematic to human activities including flood mitigation, conservation of endangered species and threatened environments, boating, and irrigation.

==Cancer research==
Researchers at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas discovered that extracts of giant salvinia have shown promising signs of inhibiting growth of human cancer cells without destroying nearby healthy ones.

==Salvinia effect==
The salvinia effect describes the stabilization of an air layer upon a submerged hydrophobic (water repellent) surface by hydrophilic (water-loving) pins. This physicochemical phenomenon was discovered on the floating fern &quot;Salvinia molesta&quot; by the botanist Wilhelm Barthlott (Universität Bonn) while working on the lotus effect and was described in cooperation with the physicist Thomas Schimmel (Karlsruher Institut für Technologie), fluid mechanist Alfred Leder (Universität Rostock) and their colleagues in 2010.

==Control==
===Biological control===
A tiny weevil, &quot;Cyrtobagous salviniae&quot;, found in the native distribution of &quot;S. molesta&quot;, is being studied as a biocontrol. &quot;C. salvinae&quot; was first used as a biological control in Australia at Lake Moondarra, a recreational lake in Mount Isa, Queensland in 1980. By mid-1981, the weevil had reduced the population to a few small patches. It ate the leaves of the weed, but preferred the buds. Its larvae ate the roots, rhizomes, and the buds. As the plant died, it turned brown and sank to the bottom of the waterway and decomposed. This weevil was used with success in other parts of the world (13 tropical countries) such as the Sepik River in Papua, Sri Lanka, Lake Ossa in Cameroon as part of an AMMCO project to restore African manatee; Wappa Dam in Queensland, and lagoons (e.g. Kakadu National Park) in the Northern Territory, Australia. In Australia, the moth, &quot;Samea multiplicalis&quot; was also released in the hopes that it would reduce the size of the weed population. While this moth did become established in Australia and spread, it was not effective as a biological control. A third species, the grasshopper &quot;Paulinia acuminata&quot;, was considered, but not released in Australia. However, this grasshopper has been deliberately released for control of &quot;Salvinia molesta&quot; in parts of Africa, Sri Lanka and India, and accidentally in Puerto Rico. The giant gourami has long been known to prefer &quot;S. molesta&quot; and feed on it voraciously. It has been successfully used to control &quot;S. molesta&quot; in reservoirs of Sri Lanka.

===Mechanical control===
Plants are removed by machine or harvesting equipment and by hand; the latter is suitable only for small infestations. Harvesting equipment also can encounter difficulties, as it cannot remove all of the infestation, it cannot access shallow areas, and equipment can be inhibited by large masses of the plant. Once removed, the plant must be dried, burnt, or disposed of in a manner that ensures it will not re-enter the waterway. Other methods to control the aquatic weed are dredging and chaining.

===Chemical control===
Chemical control on &quot;S. molesta&quot; is difficult as it does have some resistance to herbicides. The chemical fluridon has been successfully used, but it requires prolonged contact and is not effective if it is suddenly diluted by rainwater or any other influx of water. Other chemicals, such as hexazinone and diquat and double-chelated copper are used together to kill &quot;S. molesta&quot;.

==Prevention==
Bans on the spreading, selling, relocation, and transportation of &quot;S. molesta&quot; may help in the prevention of further spreading.

In Caddo Lake, efforts to eradicate &quot;S. molesta&quot; have included the farming and introduction of salvinia weevils which eat the plant. They are used as a method of biological pest control which from anecdotal evidence show a positive yet slow success rate.

==Mapping==
Satellite images are used to identify &quot;S. molesta&quot; in reservoirs in Texas.

== Chemistry ==
The phenolic compounds 6&#x27;-O-(3,4-dihydroxy benzoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester, 4-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside-3-hydroxy methyl benzoate, methyl benzoate, hypogallic acid, caffeic acid, paeoniflorin and pikuroside can be isolated from &quot;Salvinia molesta&quot;.

<doc id="99954" wikidata="Q1806831" url="?curid=99954" title="Late Night with David Letterman">
<text>Late Night with David Letterman is an American television talk show broadcast by NBC. The show is the first installment of the &quot;Late Night&quot;. Hosted by David Letterman, it aired from February1, 1982 to June 25, 1993, and was replaced by &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

In 2013, this series and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; were ranked No. 41 on TV Guide&#x27;s 60 Best Series of All Time. During its run, the show was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series 11 times. It was also nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series 14 times, winning 4, and won one Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Variety Series out of 7 nominations.

==History==
In the wake of his NBC morning show being cancelled in October 1980 after 18 weeks on the air, David Letterman was still held in high enough regard by the network brass, especially NBC president Fred Silverman, that upon hearing the 33-year-old comedian was being courted by a first-run syndication company, NBC gave him a US$20,000 per week ($1,000,000 for a year) deal to sit out a year and guest-host &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on multiple occasions. Earlier that year in May, after significant acrimony, NBC and Carson had reached an agreement on a new contract, which—among other concessions to Carson—granted the powerful and influential host the control over the time slot immediately following &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

From late fall 1980 until the end of 1981, in addition to guest-hosting 22 episodes of the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, as outlined in his one-year holding deal with NBC, Letterman also appeared five times as Carson&#x27;s guest on the highly rated program as the network groomed the 34-year-old for a new project.

Finally, on November9, 1981, NBC and Carson&#x27;s production company Carson Productions (as well as Letterman&#x27;s own newly established production company Space Age Meats Productions, forerunner to today&#x27;s Worldwide Pants Incorporated) announced the creation of &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, set to premiere in early 1982 in the 12:30 a.m. time slot Monday through Thursday, with occasional specials every few Fridays, all aimed at young men. The network wanted to capitalize on catering to young males, feeling that there was very little late-night programming for that demographic. The newly announced show thus displaced the &quot;Tomorrow Coast to Coast&quot; program hosted by Tom Snyder from the 12:30 slot. NBC initially offered Snyder to move his show back an hour, but Snyder, already unhappy with being forced to adopt changes to &quot;Tomorrow&quot; that he detested, refused and ended the show instead. The final first-run &quot;Tomorrow&quot; episode aired on December17, 1981.

The staff responsible for preparing the launch of &quot;Late Night&quot; included Merrill Markoe in the head writing role, seasoned TV veteran Hal Gurnee as director, Letterman&#x27;s manager Jack Rollins as executive producer, and a group of young writers—most of them in their early twenties, along with the somewhat more experienced 29-year-old Jim Downey, who had previously written for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and 27-year-old Steve O&#x27;Donnell. Markoe stepped down as head writer after a few months, and was succeeded by Downey who was in turn succeeded by O&#x27;Donnell in 1983. O&#x27;Donnell would serve as the head writer through most of the rest of the show&#x27;s run while Downey went back to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1984. Also on board, initially as a production assistant in charge of the &quot;Stupid Pet Tricks&quot; segment, was 21-year-old Chris Elliott. Elliott would quickly be promoted to writer and a recurring featured player.

The plan from the start was to resurrect the spirit of Letterman&#x27;s morning show for a late-night audience, one more likely to plug into his offbeat humor. The show also got a house band, hiring NBC staff musician Paul Shaffer to lead the group. They were informally dubbed &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Band&quot; in early episodes, but this was then dropped for several years; through much of the show&#x27;s run, the band existed without a formal name. The moniker &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Band&quot; was reinstated in 1988, and continued through the rest of the show.

Realizing that NBC executives exhibited very little desire to micromanage various aspects of the show, the staff felt confident they would be allowed to push outside of the mainstream talk-show boundaries and thus set about putting together a quirky, absurdist, and odd program. Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&quot; re-runs continued until Thursday, January28, 1982, and four days later on Monday, February1, 1982, &quot;Late Night&quot; premiered with a cold opening featuring Larry &quot;Bud&quot; Melman delivering lines as an homage to the prologue of Boris Karloff&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, followed by Letterman coming out on stage to Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Piano Concerto No. 1&quot; behind a group of female dancers—the peacock girls who had also opened the finale of &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot;. After a brief monologue, the very first comedy segment was a sarcastic tour of the studio. The first guest, 31-year-old comedian and actor Bill Murray, came out in confrontational fashion, throwing jibes and accusations at the host as part of a knowing put-on. He remained for two more similarly sardonic segments in which he first presented footage of a Chinese zoo baby panda as a supposed home video of his recently adopted pet, before expressing newfound love for aerobics and pulling a crew member onstage, making her do jumping jacks along with him to Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s &quot;Physical&quot;. The second comedy piece was a remote titled &quot;The Shame of the City&quot;; taking a general format of a local news action segment, it featured Letterman touring several New York locations pointing out various civic problems with righteous indignation. The second guest was Don Herbert, TV&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Wizard&quot;, and the show ended with a young comic named Steve Fessler reciting aloud the script of the obscure Bela Lugosi film &quot;Bowery at Midnight&quot;.

The reviews were mixed—&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Much of Letterman&#x27;s first week did not jell&quot;—but more importantly, the show drew 1.5 million viewers, 30% more than had tuned in for Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&quot;.

On the third night, after baseball great Hank Aaron finished his interview segment with Letterman, a camera followed him backstage, where TV sportscaster Al Albert conducted a post-interview chat with Aaron about how it had gone. Eccentric and awkward, the show immediately established a sensibility that was clearly different from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

The show was produced by Johnny Carson&#x27;s production company, as a result of a clause in Carson&#x27;s contract with NBC that gave him control of what immediately followed &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Carson, for his part, wanted &quot;Late Night&quot; to have as little overlap with his show as possible. In fact, most ground rules and restrictions on what Letterman could do came not from the network but from the production company itself. Letterman could not have a sidekick like Ed McMahon, and Paul Shaffer&#x27;s band could not include a horn section like Doc Severinsen&#x27;s. Letterman was told he could not book old-school showbiz guests such as James Stewart, George Burns, or Buddy Hackett, who were fixtures on Johnny&#x27;s show (the fact that &quot;Tonight&quot; had long moved to Hollywood and &quot;Late Night&quot; was taped in New York helped minimize guest overlap). Letterman was also specifically instructed not to replicate any of the signature pieces of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; like &quot;Stump the Band&quot; or &quot;Carnac the Magnificent&quot;. Carson also wanted Letterman to minimize the number of topical jokes in his opening monologue.

===Production and scheduling===
&quot;Late Night&quot; originated from NBC Studio 6A at the RCA (later GE) Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City. The program ran four nights a week, Monday to Thursday, from the show&#x27;s premiere on February1, 1982, until June4, 1987. Friday shows were added on June12, 1987, although the show still only produced four new episodes a week. Monday&#x27;s shows were re-runs. NBC previously aired &quot;Friday Night Videos&quot; in the 12:30 a.m. slot on Saturday morning, with occasional &quot;Late Night&quot; specials and reruns. &quot;Friday Night Videos&quot; was reduced to an hour&#x27;s length and moved up an hour to 1:30 a.m. on Saturday morning.

Starting on September2, 1991, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; was pushed back from 11:30 p.m. to 11:35 p.m., with Letterman starting at 12:35 a.m., at the request of NBC affiliates who wanted more advertising time for their profitable late newscasts.

Like &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in the 1980s and early 1990s, &quot;Late Night&quot; aired annual anniversary specials. They aired on or about February1, first in its own timeslot (albeit on a Friday, preempting &quot;SCTV&quot;). From 1984 to 1987, episodes of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; were preempted for the special. Finally, from 1988 to 1990 and in 1992, the special aired in prime time, after &quot;Cheers&quot;. There were no anniversary specials in 1991 and 1993. (Letterman would leave NBC later in 1993.) &quot;David Letterman&#x27;s Holiday Film Festival&quot; also aired in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s timeslot over Thanksgiving weekend in 1985, before a second and final installment aired in prime time the Friday after Thanksgiving in 1986. The festivals were a collection of shorts starring, directed and/or written by celebrities.

===Syndication===
On September30, 1991, A&amp;E, a U.S. cable channel partly owned by General Electric—then the parent company of NBC—began broadcasting repeats of &quot;Late Night&quot; in an effort of monetizing the show&#x27;s vast accumulation of old episodes. The repeats aired for less than a year, until July24, 1992. The syndication deal had been brokered without Letterman&#x27;s knowledge, and he frequently made his displeasure of the arrangement known on-air, feeling that having reruns broadcast five nights a week, earlier in the evening on cable, diluted the value of the nightly first-run shows on NBC—fearing people would not be willing to stay up late for the first-run if they could watch repeats of the program at an earlier time. Because of Letterman&#x27;s opposition, the syndication run was ended early and not attempted again until after he had left NBC.

In November 1993, E! Entertainment Television purchased syndication rights to &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. The network broadcast repeats of complete shows from various years five days per week from 1993 until 1996. Then, Trio: Popular Arts Television (owned by NBC/Vivendi Universal Entertainment) picked up reruns and showed them from 2002 until the channel went off the air in 2005.

A number of programs were sold by GoodTimes Entertainment in 1992–93. These episodes were stripped of the series theme, open and close. No DVD release is currently scheduled (GoodTimes went bankrupt in 2005; the company&#x27;s assets are now owned by Gaiam, which does not typically distribute general-interest programming). In February 2022, through a licensing agreement between NBC and Worldwide Pants and coinciding with the 40th anniversary of &quot;Late Night&quot;&#x27;s premiere, Letterman opened his official YouTube channel, which contains clips of Letterman&#x27;s &quot;Late Night&quot; and his previous morning and subsequent &quot;Late Show&quot; programs.

===Letterman moves to CBS===
Letterman, who had hoped to get the hosting job of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; following Johnny Carson&#x27;s retirement, moved to CBS in 1993 when the job was given to Jay Leno. This was done against the wishes of Carson, who had always seen Letterman as his rightful successor, according to CBS senior vice president Peter Lassally, a one-time producer for both men. Letterman announced the move on January14, 1993. On April25, 1993, Lorne Michaels chose Conan O&#x27;Brien, who was a writer for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; at the time and a former writer for Michaels at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, to fill Letterman&#x27;s old seat directly after &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. O&#x27;Brien began hosting a new show in Letterman&#x27;s old timeslot, taking over the &quot;Late Night&quot; name on September13, 1993.

When Letterman left, NBC asserted their intellectual property rights to several of the most popular &quot;Late Night&quot; segments. Letterman easily adapted to these restrictions for his CBS show: The &quot;Viewer Mail&quot; segment was continued under the name &quot;CBS Mailbag,&quot; and &quot;Late Night&quot; fixture Larry &quot;Bud&quot; Melman continued his antics under his real name, Calvert DeForest. Similarly, the in-house band (now free to add horns) was unable to use the name &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Band,&quot; so the name was changed to &quot;Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra&quot;. The name &quot;CBS Orchestra&quot;, approved by CBS (who retained rights to the name after Letterman retired in 2015), was Shaffer&#x27;s idea. Notably, however, &quot;Stupid Pet Tricks&quot; originated on Letterman&#x27;s 1980 early morning show &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot;, to which Letterman, not NBC, owned the rights. This meant &quot;Stupid Pet Tricks&quot; was able to cross over to the CBS show with its name and concept unchanged. With Carson retired, Letterman was also granted free use of some of Carson&#x27;s sketches, and in due time, &quot;Stump the Band&quot; and &quot;Carnac the Magnificent&quot; (with Shaffer as Carnac) entered the &quot;Late Show&quot; rotation.

==Format==

Like most other late-night talk shows, the show featured at least two or three guests each night, usually including a comedian or musical guest.

Letterman frequently used crew members in his comedy bits, so viewers got to know the writers and crew members of the show. Common contributors included bandleader Paul Shaffer, Chris Elliott, Calvert DeForest as &quot;Larry &#x27;Bud&#x27; Melman,&quot; announcer Bill Wendell, writer Adam Resnick, scenic designer Kathleen Ankers, stage manager Biff Henderson, producer Robert Morton, director Hal Gurnee, associate director Peter Fatovich, stage hand Al Maher, camera operator Baily Stortz, production manager Elmer Gorry as NBC President Grant Tinker, and the &quot;production twins,&quot; Barbara Gaines and Jude Brennan. The cramped quarters of 30 Rockefeller Plaza also often played into the humor of the show.

Letterman&#x27;s show established a reputation for being unpredictable. A number of celebrities had even stated that they were afraid of appearing on the show. This reputation was born out of moments like Letterman&#x27;s verbal sparring matches with Cher, Shirley MacLaine and Harvey Pekar.

The show had its frequent favorite guests including Pee-wee Herman, Steve Martin, Charles Grodin, George Carlin and Jay Leno. Ruth Westheimer, Teri Garr and Sandra Bernhard were also frequently booked, with Garr appearing 32 times, Bernhard appearing 28 times and Westheimer, 15 times.

Because of the creativity of staff writers like Merrill Markoe, Letterman&#x27;s NBC show, in its first few years especially, had innovative segments and theme shows that were new and different from other talk shows of the time. Some were visual gags that owed a debt to pioneers like Ernie Kovacs and Steve Allen. Among the highlights were:

*One early episode showed everything from Dave&#x27;s eye view with Markoe and others coming at Dave to pitch ideas as he walked onto the stage, and the audience was shown from Dave&#x27;s view during the monologue and the opening segments. 
*In another show, the picture turned like a clock, eventually being seen upside down halfway through. 
*There were segments where Letterman was dressed in a suit of Velcro and stuck (thrown) to a Velcro wall, a suit of chips and dunked into a vat of chip dip, a suit of Rice Krispies and doused with gallons of milk while lying in a huge bowl, a suit of Alka-Seltzer tablets and dunked in water, a suit of suet and placed in a cage with farm animals, etc. 
*Visual segments showing things being crushed by a hydraulic press, thrown through fluorescent lights or dropped off an office building to smash on the ground, were also common.
*Letterman&#x27;s desk featured a control panel where he could operate a bubble machine, a confetti cannon, &quot;radioactive&quot; steam, a belch of New York soot or strange lighting. 
*When he threw his pencils through the fake window scene behind him, a sound effect of breaking glass was always heard. Occasionally, if sound effects technician Howard Vinitisky was slow in triggering the appropriate breaking glass sound effect, Letterman would mockingly chide Vinitisky for the error (he would also occasionally congratulate Vinitisky when the sound effect was especially well-timed).
*A robotic arm for a while delivered the Top Ten List, and for another week or so, a complicated series of tubes would produce swirling coffee to eventually land in his cup on the desk.
* Cameras mounted on a chimpanzee&#x27;s back (Late Night Monkey Cam) or on the roof (Roof Cam) would show odd viewpoints of the set and its participants.

Other show format innovations related to the way individual episodes or segments were presented:

*The Custom Made Shows allowed the audience to vote on each part of the hour, what they wanted to see, and the resulting shows had guests talking in high-pitched voices like they had inhaled helium (Jane Pauley refused to say a word during this, and answered his questions by writing answers on cards and showing them), sitting in dentist chairs or lawn furniture, the theme music replaced by the theme from &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, and an opening montage of the director&#x27;s vacation photos. 
*Reruns were often at by Letterman, telling the audience not to waste their time watching next Monday. Sometimes the entire rerun would be dubbed into a foreign language for rebroadcast, baffling viewers. 
*Letterman once had a member of the audience host the show and interview guests while he left the studio (ostensibly to search for a missing tooth).
*Letterman hosted the show from his home while waiting for his cable TV to be installed; another episode was done from the production offices upstairs, as the cast claimed they were &quot;too tired&quot; to go downstairs to the studio.
*Crispin Glover and Oliver Reed frightened Dave with their nearly violent, confrontational behaviour in their appearances.

<text>Late Show with David Letterman is an American late-night talk show hosted by David Letterman on CBS, the first iteration of the &quot;Late Show&quot; franchise. The show debuted on August 30, 1993, and was produced by Letterman&#x27;s production company, Worldwide Pants, and CBS Television Studios. The show&#x27;s music director and leader of the house band, the CBS Orchestra, was Paul Shaffer. The head writer was Matt Roberts and the announcer was originally Bill Wendell, then Alan Kalter. In most U.S. markets the show aired from 11:35 p.m. to 12:37 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, and recorded Monday to Wednesdays at 4:30 p.m., and Thursdays at 3:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The second Thursday episode usually aired on Friday of that week.

In 2002, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; was ranked No. 7 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. As host of both &quot;Late Night&quot; and &quot;Late Show&quot; for more than 30 years, Letterman surpassed Johnny Carson as the longest running late-night talk show host in 2013. That same year, &quot;Late Night&quot; and &quot;Late Show&quot; were ranked at No. 41 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 60 Best Series of All Time. The show was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series 16 times, winning 6. It was also nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Variety Series 15 times, and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series 16 times during its run.

In 2014, Letterman announced his retirement; the final episode of &quot;Late Show&quot; aired on May 20, 2015. After Letterman&#x27;s final &quot;Late Show&quot;, instead of airing reruns of the show or having guest host episodes of &quot;Late Show&quot;, CBS opted to air reruns of scripted dramas in the 11:35 pm time slot over the summer with the branding &quot;CBS Summer Showcase&quot;. The show was then succeeded by &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, hosted by Stephen Colbert, which premiered on September 8, 2015.

==History==
CBS had previously attempted late-night talk shows with &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; (1969–1972) and &quot;The Pat Sajak Show&quot; (1989–1990), but Griffin clashed with network censors and moved to syndication while Sajak was unable to compete with NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and was canceled due to poor ratings. For most of the 20 years preceding &quot;Late Show&quot;, CBS&#x27;s late night fare consisted of movies, reruns and specialty programming packaged under the name 
&quot;CBS Late Night&quot; and broadcast to middling ratings. When David Letterman became available following a conflict with NBC, CBS was eager to lure him and offered him a three-year, $14 million per year contract, doubling his &quot;Late Night&quot; salary. According to their agreement, the show would spend a month in Hollywood at least once a year.

CBS purchased the Ed Sullivan Theater for $4 million, spending &quot;several million&quot; to renovate it. The renovation was supervised by architect James Polshek. CBS&#x27; total cost for acquiring the show including renovations, negotiation rights paid to NBC, signing Letterman, announcer Bill Wendell, Shaffer, the writers and the band was over $140 million.

A significant issue regarding Letterman&#x27;s move to CBS was the ownership of long-running comedy bits used on &quot;Late Night,&quot; as well as the name of the CBS show itself. NBC claimed that much of what he did on &quot;Late Night&quot; was intellectual property of the network. Letterman and his attorneys countered that some segments (&quot;Stupid Pet Tricks&quot;, for example) pre-dated &quot;Late Night&quot; and had first aired on &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot;, which was owned by Letterman&#x27;s production company rather than NBC, and others, such as the Top Ten List and Viewer Mail, were common property and not owned by either Letterman or NBC. Ultimately a compromise was reached in key areas: the &quot;Viewer Mail&quot; segment would be called the &quot;CBS Mailbag&quot;; the actor portraying Larry &quot;Bud&quot; Melman on &quot;Late Night&quot; would use his real name, Calvert DeForest, on the CBS show; and Paul Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Band&quot; would become the &quot;CBS Orchestra&quot;.

NBC gave Letterman the choice of at least two options to name his new show, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; or &quot;Nightly with David Letterman&quot;. On this matter CBS executives stepped in, rejecting &quot;Nightly&quot; in part because of potential confusion with &quot;Nightline&quot; on ABC, along with the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. Thus, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; quickly became the official name.

After Letterman was introduced on &quot;Late Show&quot;″s very first episode, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; anchor Tom Brokaw accompanied him on stage and wished him &quot;reasonably well&quot;. As part of a pre-arranged act, Brokaw then proceeded to retrieve a pair of cue cards while stating that &quot;These last two jokes are the intellectual property of NBC!&quot; After he carried them off stage, Letterman responded, &quot;Who would have thought you would ever hear the words &#x27;intellectual property&#x27; and &#x27;NBC&#x27; in the same sentence?&quot; In his opening monologue, Letterman said &quot;Legally, I can continue to call myself Dave&quot; but joked that he woke up that morning and next to him in bed was the head of a peacock (while the orchestra played the theme from &quot;The Godfather&quot;).

In ratings, Letterman&#x27;s &quot;Late Show&quot; dominated Jay Leno&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; for its first two years. Leno pulled ahead on July 10, 1995, starting with a Hugh Grant interview, after Grant&#x27;s much-publicized arrest for picking up a Los Angeles prostitute. Leno also benefited from the lead-in provided by NBC&#x27;s popular &quot;Must See TV&quot; prime time programs of the mid-to-late 1990s. Likewise, the CBS network was hindered by a weak prime time lineup, along with several large- and major-market network affiliation switches in late 1994 relating to Fox&#x27;s acquisition of CBS&#x27;s National Football League rights, stunting the &quot;Late Show&quot; just as it was beginning to gain traction.

Announcer Bill Wendell retired in 1995, with Alan Kalter taking his place.

At times &quot;Late Show&quot; even came in third in its time slot (behind &quot;Nightline&quot;, most recently in November 2008), once prompting Letterman to arrange for a Manhattan billboard proudly declaring himself and his show to be No. 3 in Late Night, aping an older, nearby billboard which promoted Leno and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; as No. 1. Letterman attempted to respond by making his show more political, aping the approach taken by &quot;The Daily Show&quot; under Jon Stewart. He acknowledged in 2024 that he believed that the &quot;Late Show&quot; had lost ground to &quot;Tonight&quot; because Leno was an everyman whose show was &quot;more likable than the show I was doing,&quot; and that Letterman had made &quot;certain elemental mistakes&quot; that handicapped the &quot;Late Show&#x27;s&quot; performance.

On June 1, 2009, Conan O&#x27;Brien (who had succeeded Letterman as host of &quot;Late Night&quot; in 1993) took over as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;—an event Letterman referenced in his own show&#x27;s Top Ten List on that night—and Letterman&#x27;s &quot;feud&quot; with Leno temporarily ceased. In 2008 Letterman told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he would welcome Leno on his show once Leno&#x27;s tenure ended. Letterman said on competing with O&#x27;Brien, &quot;I still find it hard to believe that Jay won&#x27;t be there.&quot; The interview was held prior to Leno announcing his return to NBC for &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;. In the second week after Letterman and O&#x27;Brien began their opposing broadcasts, viewer ratings for &quot;Tonight&quot; began to slip and &quot;Late Show&quot; was poised to beat &quot;Tonight&quot; for the first time in over ten years, a fact pointed out by Letterman&#x27;s guests on air (Howard Stern and Julia Roberts). Letterman quickly tried to change the subject in the interviews and tried to avert a new rivalry. In fact, the June 9, 2009 episode of &quot;Late Show&quot; featuring Roberts rated better than &quot;Tonight&quot; with a 3.4 household rating nationally to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s 2.9. The Letterman/Leno feud was revived in the wake of the 2010 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; conflict, which saw Letterman side with O&#x27;Brien. Despite the rivalry, Leno appeared in a &quot;Late Show&quot; promo with Letterman and Oprah Winfrey which aired on CBS during Super Bowl XLIV; it was Leno and Letterman&#x27;s first joint appearance since Leno took over the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; in 1992. The feud between the hosts ended for good on February 6, 2014, with Leno&#x27;s second and final retirement and &quot;Late Night&quot; host Jimmy Fallon, who succeeded Conan O&#x27;Brien in 2009, becoming the current host of the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; on February 17, with its subsequent return to New York for the first time since 1972.

On April 3, 2012, CBS reached an agreement with Worldwide Pants and CBS Television Studios to continue the show through 2014. The parties reached another agreement in October 2013 to extend the show an additional year, continuing the series into 2015. Including his 11 years on NBC, Letterman is the longest tenured late-night talk show host, having surpassed Johnny Carson.

On April 10, 2014, one week after Letterman announced that he would retire as host of &quot;Late Show&quot; in 2015, CBS announced that his successor as the host of the program would be Stephen Colbert, then host of competing late-night series &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on Comedy Central. Letterman&#x27;s last &quot;Late Show&quot; aired May 20, 2015. In February 2022, David Letterman&#x27;s official YouTube channel opened, and contains clips from Letterman&#x27;s &quot;Late Show&quot; and his previous morning and late night shows on NBC.

==Staff==
Announcer Bill Wendell retired and left the show on August 18, 1995. He was replaced by Alan Kalter on the show&#x27;s next episode, September 5, 1995, which came after a two-week hiatus.

In 1996, long-time producer Robert Morton left, and head writer Rob Burnett was promoted to executive producer.

In 1997, Justin Stangel and Eric Stangel were hired as writers; by March 2000, the Stangel brothers became the show&#x27;s head writers, taking over the job held by Rodney Rothman.

Director Hal Gurnee and producer Peter Lassally left the show soon after to pursue other interests. Gurnee was replaced by Jerry Foley. Burnett was absent from the day-to-day operations from 2000 to 2004, and was replaced by Barbara Gaines and Maria Pope, both of whom served as executive producers, with Gaines acting as on-air producer. In 2003, producer Jude Brennan was added to the team of executive producers.

Lassally, who had served as an executive producer for Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, was invited back to &quot;Late Show&quot; in January 2005 as a guest to discuss the recent death of Carson. Lassally served as executive producer for Worldwide Pants&#x27; &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; from late 1994 to February 2015, encompassing the tenures of hosts Tom Snyder, Craig Kilborn and Craig Ferguson. Lassally also served as Executive Producer of the &quot;Tony Mendez Show&quot;, an online webcast featuring &quot;Late Show&quot;s &quot;cue card boy&quot;, Tony Mendez (c.1945–July 29, 2021). Mendez served in that capacity until 2014, when after a long-running dispute with writer Bill Scheft over Scheft micromanaging Mendez&#x27;s job, he attacked Scheft and was fired.

Matt Roberts, a long-time writer and producer for the show, became the show&#x27;s head writer in January 2013, replacing brothers and co-head writers Justin Stangel and Eric Stangel.

Sheila Rogers, the producer responsible for booking guests on the show, worked for Letterman since his &quot;Late Night&quot; days.

Biff Henderson served as the show&#x27;s stage manager, carrying over from &quot;Late Night&quot;. Henderson had a prominent on-camera role with the show.

==Production==

===Studio and set design===

The show was taped at the Ed Sullivan Theater at the corner of Broadway and 53rd Street in midtown Manhattan during its entire run. Formerly called CBS Studio 50, it had been home to several TV programs over the years, most notably &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Letterman made use of the immediate neighborhood surrounding the theater for his show on occasion, closing off the portion of 53rd Street that goes past his studio for various stunts. Nearby merchants gained fame after making frequent appearances on the program, including Rupert Jee, owner of the Hello Deli at 213 W. 53rd St., and Mujibur and Sirajul, Bengali immigrants who worked at a souvenir shop close to the studio.

The stage layout followed the same basic structure Letterman employed on &quot;Late Night&quot;: the house band appeared on the far left, followed by the performance area and then the interview set.

In May 2015, days before Letterman retired, Seth Stevenson described what it was like to attend a taping of &quot;Late Show&quot;:

Pieces of the set were later acquired for use on &quot;The Chris Gethard Show&quot;.

===Same-day tapings===
When Letterman was not on vacation (which he took roughly ten weeks per year), he and his crew worked four days per week, taping Friday&#x27;s show earlier in the week. From October 2001 until May 2004, Friday&#x27;s show was taped on Thursdays. From 2004 to 2010, Friday&#x27;s show was taped on Mondays. During this time, the Friday&#x27;s show&#x27;s monologue topics, sketches, and other segments were chosen for their lack of topicality, with few if any references to current events or any subject which would run the risk of seeming dated. However, in late 2011 &quot;Late Show&quot; reverted to the practice of taping the Friday show on Thursdays, helping the Friday shows become more topical and relevant.

===Episode structure===

The show&#x27;s opening credits featured a series of shots of New York City as the CBS Orchestra performed the &quot;Late Show&quot; theme (a livelier variation of the more jazzy &quot;Late Night&quot; theme). The announcer presented the names of that night&#x27;s guests, as well as Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra, then introduced Letterman. On rare episodes, the show began with a cold open as Letterman, dressed casually, briefly interacted with a celebrity or performed a short sketch backstage before the traditional opening sequence began. As with his previous shows, the copy for the open included non sequiturs about New York and Letterman, though the former would change after the September 11 attacks to simply &quot;the greatest city in the world&quot;.

In the last few years, Alan Kalter included himself in the introduction. In addition, Letterman took to dashing across the stage either just before, while, or just after Kalter introduced him. In years prior, Letterman would be greeted by two female models, sometimes in costume. For an extended stretch of episodes, one of the models would be performing with several hula hoops, while the other would be wearing a metal suit and operating a grinding machine against her abdomen, a carry-over from their first appearance on the sketch, &quot;Is This Anything?&quot;

Letterman would then walk out on the show stage to perform his stand-up monologue, which occasionally began with a reference to something an audience member said to him during the pre-show question-and-answer session. The jokes were based on pop culture, current events, and politics. He then introduced one or two video jokes such as a running gag or fake commercial/public service announcement. The monologue was followed by Letterman&#x27;s introduction of Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra. Beginning in 2009, a commercial break replaced Letterman&#x27;s trademark &#x27;crossing to the desk&#x27;, which he had done since the early years. Letterman then chatted with the audience and Shaffer, sometimes relating an anecdote from his personal life, sometimes discussing his anticipation of a particular guest; a running gag may have been featured.

In 2005, after the death of Johnny Carson, it was revealed that Carson had made a habit of sometimes sending jokes to Letterman which Letterman would then incorporate into his monologues. The January 31, 2005, episode of the &quot;Late Show&quot;, which featured a tribute to Carson, began with a monologue made up entirely of jokes written by Carson since his retirement.

Letterman read the Top Ten List at this point before turning to guest interviews with a celebrity, politician, or other public figure. On most episodes, the first guest stayed on through the commercial break and continued the interview.

Following the first guest was a short segment to bridge two commercial breaks sequentially. In earlier episodes, Letterman would return to his running gag during this break, or retry a failed stunt from earlier in the show. Later episodes included a brief comedy announcement from announcer Alan Kalter while showing the audience cheering.

The final segment consisted of a live musical performance, a comedian performing a stand-up routine, or another guest interview. Musical guests included artists from David Bowie, U2, Neil Young, Coldplay to indie bands like Grizzly Bear, Gorillaz, MENEW, and Animal Collective. The CBS Orchestra frequently accompanied musical guests in performing their songs. Episodes occasionally concluded with Letterman recommending viewers stay tuned for &quot;Tom Snyder&quot;, &quot;Craig Kilborn&quot;, &quot;Craig Ferguson&quot; (&quot;James Corden&quot; in 2015), but usually he simply waved to the camera, saying, &quot;Good night everybody!&quot; In the latter part of the run, the admonishment to watch Craig Ferguson and James Corden was delivered by Alan Kalter, via voiceover.

===Regular sketches===

&quot;Late Show&quot; had various repeated absurdist segments, including those involving cast members&#x27; and audience participation. The show will also take a camera crew into the Hello Deli to show games such as &quot;What&#x27;s on the iPod?&quot; and &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;, or onto 53rd Street or the roof to record various stunts there.

===High-definition broadcasts===
The show began broadcasting in high-definition television (HDTV) on August 29, 2005. About two weeks later, Tim Kennedy, the show&#x27;s Technical Director, commented on the transition in the show&#x27;s official newsletter:

Kennedy and his crew won an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video for a Series&quot; during the nearly four-month-long transition to HDTV.

==Notable episodes==

The guests with the most appearances were Regis Philbin (150 appearances), Marv Albert (126 appearances, 73 from &quot;Late Night&quot;), and Jack Hanna (102).

Among the show&#x27;s highlights:
* The premiere on August 30, 1993, which attracted 23 million viewers; Bill Murray was the show&#x27;s first guest, and Billy Joel was the show&#x27;s first musical act;
* In a September 7, 1993, interview, Rosie Perez mentioned that she had attended a DJ party called Funkmaster Flex Night to which Letterman jokingly displayed his ignorance by pretending to know with the response “Funk. Master. Flex night… Hard to get a ticket to Funkmaster Flex Night.” This was later sampled by the DJ himself and it became a famous needle drop in the hip hop community. Letterman was made aware of this cultural moment 26 years later by Desus and Mero when he appeared on their show.
* The episode featuring Madonna on March 31, 1994;
* A visit from Drew Barrymore on April 12, 1995, during which she &quot;jump[ed] on his desk and flash[ed] her breasts&quot; in a &quot;birthday gift he&#x27;ll never forget&quot;;
* The episode on December 31, 1999, airing in prime-time.
* The episodes airing the week of February 21, 2000, which began with Letterman&#x27;s return to the air after his quintuple bypass surgery, with Bill Cosby hosting the show of February 22, as the show&#x27;s first ever substitute host, and Regis Philbin hosting on February 24.
* His return to the airwaves on September 17, 2001, following the September 11 attacks in a show that featured Dan Rather, Regis Philbin, The Boys&#x27; Choir of Harlem, and Odetta—it was &quot;hailed by the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; as &#x27;one of the purest, most honest and important moments in TV history&#x27;.&quot;
* The October 30, 2002, episode in which the sole guest was frequent guest and substitute bandleader Warren Zevon, devoted to discussing Zevon&#x27;s terminal cancer diagnosis.
* March 17, 2004, Courtney Love appeared on the show to promote her debut solo album, America&#x27;s Sweetheart. Her appearance drew widespread media coverage when she lifted her shirt multiple times and flashed her breasts at Letterman in a reenactment of Drew Barrymore&#x27;s appearance.
* January 31, 2005, was Letterman&#x27;s first show after his long-time friend and mentor Johnny Carson had died. His monologue that night consisted entirely of jokes written by Carson. Carson had died on January 23, but Letterman&#x27;s show was in reruns at the time.
* January 2, 2008, was the first night the &quot;Late Show&quot; returned to air after the 2007 WGA strike began. Due to a compromise worked out between Worldwide Pants and WGA, &quot;Late Show&quot; was allowed to continue with writers on the job until the strike ended in February 2008.
* In 2008, John McCain was originally scheduled to be the guest on the show but cancelled at the last minute, supposedly to deal with the economic crisis. However, it was revealed during the show that while the show was being taped, McCain was actually doing an interview with Katie Couric for CBS News. McCain&#x27;s last-minute replacement was Keith Olbermann.
* Paul McCartney appeared as a guest on July 15, 2009, in the same theater where the Beatles made their U.S. television debut in 1964. McCartney later performed &quot;Get Back&quot; on top of the theater&#x27;s marquee, emulating the Beatles&#x27; rooftop concert of 1969.
* On October 1, 2009, Letterman revealed that he had been the target of an extortion attempt.
* On October 29, 2012, the show was taped without an audience due to Hurricane Sandy, which prompted the &quot;Late Show&quot; staff to send the audience home for safety reasons.
* On April 3, 2014, Letterman announced his retirement from the &quot;Late Show&quot;.
* On April 22, 2014, Stephen Colbert made his first appearance on the &quot;Late Show&quot; since being unveiled as Letterman&#x27;s successor.
* On August 18, 2014, in his first new show since the death of Robin Williams, Letterman paid tribute to the comedian, whom he had known dating back to their days at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles. &quot;I had no idea that the man was in pain, that the man was suffering,&quot; Letterman said of Williams, who committed suicide. A montage of clips aired featuring Williams&#x27; multiple appearances on the &quot;Late Show&quot;, as well as an episode of &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; in which Letterman was a guest star. The tribute was the week&#x27;s most watched late night talk show video, receiving over 3.3 million views online.
*On December 18, 2014, singer Darlene Love performed “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” for the final time on the show after performing it every year since the show began.
* The series finale on May 20, 2015, which ran 17 minutes over time and had 13.7 million viewers, was introduced by archival footage of President Gerald Ford and pre-recorded cameos of former Presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and incumbent Barack Obama all saying, &quot;our long national nightmare is over&quot;. Ten celebrities participated in the Top Ten List of &quot;Things I&#x27;ve Always Wanted to say to Dave&quot;, namely, in order of appearance, Alec Baldwin, Barbara Walters, Steve Martin, Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Carrey, Chris Rock, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Peyton Manning, Tina Fey, and Bill Murray. Letterman thanked his wife Regina and son Harry, both of whom were in the audience, his mother, viewers, the show&#x27;s staff, and Paul Shaffer and the band, and also wished good luck to his successor, Stephen Colbert. The show included highlights from &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; as well as the &quot;Late Show&quot;, featured clips of Letterman&#x27;s bits with children, a performance by the Foo Fighters playing Letterman&#x27;s favorite song, &quot;Everlong&quot;, and ended with a shot of his son, Harry, skiing.

=== Most &quot;Late Show&quot; appearances ===
The person who appeared the most on the &quot;Late Show&quot; was media personality Regis Philbin, with 150 total appearances over the show&#x27;s 22-season run. Jack Hanna was in second place with 103 appearances, followed by Tony Randall with 70, Marv Albert with 52, and Tom Brokaw with 49.

Darlene Love appeared with a musical number 21 times, most notably for a 19-year-long annual tradition of her performing &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; (18 live plus one video clip) on the show&#x27;s last episode before Christmas. This continued a tradition that started in 1986 on Letterman&#x27;s NBC show &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, performing the song as Letterman&#x27;s Christmas finale 28 times across his &quot;Late Show&quot; and &quot;Late Night&quot; run. Love&#x27;s final Christmas appearance was on December 19, 2014, nine days after the announcement that the show&#x27;s finale would be in May 2015. Letterman has stated that the annual performance is his favorite part of Christmas. Due to the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, Love was unable to perform on the Letterman show in 2007; instead, a repeat of her 2006 performance was shown. Love was also the musical guest on May 7, 2007, performing &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot;, while also appearing as a background choral singer on October 15, 2008. Love had a 22nd appearance, appearing as an interview guest on June 12, 2013, to talk about the documentary &quot;20 Feet from Stardom&quot;.

Blues Traveler holds the record for most appearances on the show by a band.

==Guest hosts==
In 2000, after Letterman had quintuple bypass surgery, the &quot;Late Show Backstage&quot; was aired. This featured many celebrities reminiscing about their experiences as guests on his show. Charles Grodin (February 7), Regis Philbin (February 8 and 10), Bandleader Paul Shaffer (February 9 and 11), Drew Barrymore (February 14), David Brenner (February 15), Tom Snyder (February 16 and 17) (Snyder hosted &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; from 1995 to 1999), and Tom Arnold (February 18) were among those who hosted. These interviews were interspersed with past footage. Previously, only reruns without any special introductions had been aired since Letterman&#x27;s temporary leave from the show began on January 15.

Letterman returned on a limited basis on February 18, in a show which premiered three days later. To ease his transition back to air, temporary guest hosts carried the show. Bill Cosby (February 22), Kathie Lee Gifford (February 24), David Brenner (February 29), Nathan Lane (March 2), Janeane Garofalo (March 7). filled in on the first week.

In February and March 2003, Letterman missed 14 shows due to shingles. Letterman had various guest hosts during his illness-inflicted absence: Bruce Willis (February 26), John McEnroe (February 27), Regis Philbin (February 28), Whoopi Goldberg (March 10), Vince Vaughn (March 11), Elvis Costello (March 12), Will Ferrell (March 13), Megan Mullally (March 14), Brad Garrett (March 17), Tom Dreesen (March 18), Bonnie Hunt (March 19), Paul Shaffer (March 24), Bill Cosby (March 25), and Luke Wilson (March 26).

In June 2003, Letterman had guest hosts on Fridays. They included Tom Arnold (June 6), Tom Green (June 13), Kelsey Grammer (June 20), and Jimmy Fallon (June 27). Letterman&#x27;s weekly absence caused the ratings deficit between his show and Leno&#x27;s to increase, so Letterman ended this experiment a month after it began.

Paul Shaffer hosted January 19, 2005, when Letterman went to receive an award for his racing team&#x27;s victory in the 2004 Indianapolis 500.

On March 20, 2007, Letterman fell ill less than an hour before the show started, and scheduled guest Adam Sandler took his place as host. Actor Don Cheadle, Sandler&#x27;s co-star in the film &quot;Reign Over Me&quot;, appeared as a guest on a moment&#x27;s notice.

==Ratings and revenue==
The show&#x27;s highest rated episode was on February 23, 1994, after the 1994 Winter Olympics (78.8 million) with 15 million viewers. Its second-highest-rated show aired two days later with 11.1 million viewers. Both were preceded by the ladies&#x27; figure skating competition which had high interest due to the assault of Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 United States Figure Skating Championships by Tonya Harding&#x27;s ex-husband and due to both women competing in the event.

In February 2013, TV by the Numbers reported that &quot;Late Show&quot; averaged about 3.1 million per show in season-to-date live-plus-seven-day ratings (i.e., from February 4). A year later, average viewership was down to 2.8 million.

In 2009, the show led other late night shows in ad revenue with $271 million. In February 2014, &quot;Advertising Age&quot; cited Kantar Media and Nielsen in reporting that for January to October 2013, &quot;Late Show&quot; attracted $179.6 million in advertising for CBS, higher than its seven late-night competitors on NBC, ABC, Comedy Central, and E!. &quot;Late Show&quot; also had the oldest median audience among those same peer broadcasts, at 58.9.

The final episode of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on May 20, 2015, was watched by 13.76 million viewers with an audience share of 9.3/24, earning the show its second-highest ratings (following the 1994 Olympics on February 25, 1994); further, it saw the show&#x27;s highest demo numbers (4.1 in adults 25-54 and 3.1 in adults 18–49) since Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s first &quot;Late Show&quot; appearance following the ending of her feud with Letterman on December 1, 2005. In a rarity for a late-night show, it was also the highest-rated program across all network television that night, beating out all shows. In Canada, the final episode was watched by 784,000 viewers, representing 516,000 more viewers than the show&#x27;s closest competitor.

Late Show has a 100% Average Tomatometer and 78% Popcorn meter on Rotten Tomatoes 

==International broadcast==
In the UK the show was aired on Sky One, The Paramount Comedy Channel, ITV2, ITV4 and Diva TV. In Australia the show aired on Network 10 only hours after US broadcast. It was also shown for a week on BBC2 during Letterman&#x27;s London shows in 1995.

In Italy the show aired on Rai5, in English with Italian subtitles.

<text>John William Carson (October 23, 1925 – January 23, 2005) was an American television host, comedian, and writer best known as the host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; (1962–1992). Carson received six Primetime Emmy Awards, the Television Academy&#x27;s 1980 Governor&#x27;s Award and a 1985 Peabody Award. He was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1987. Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1992 and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 1993.

During World War II, Carson served in the United States Navy. After the war he started a career in radio, then moved to television and took over as host of the late-night talk show &quot;Tonight&quot; from Jack Paar in 1962. Carson remained an American cultural icon even after his retirement in 1992. He adopted a casual, conversational approach with extensive interaction with guests, an approach pioneered by Arthur Godfrey and previous &quot;Tonight Show&quot; hosts Paar and Steve Allen but enhanced by Carson&#x27;s lightning-quick wit. Former late-night host and friend David Letterman, as well as many others, has cited Carson&#x27;s influence. Carson is a cultural phenomenon and widely regarded as the king of late-night television.

== Early life and career ==
John William Carson was born on October 23, 1925, in Corning, Iowa, to Ruth Elizabeth Carson (née Hook; 1901–1985) and Homer Lloyd &quot;Kit&quot; Carson (1899–1983), a power company manager. Carson was the second of three children; he had an older sister, and a younger brother, Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Carson (1929–2021).

Growing up in Iowa, Carson lived in the towns of Avoca, Clarinda and Red Oak before moving to Norfolk, Nebraska, at age 8. There, Carson grew up and began developing his talent for entertaining. At age 12 he found a book on magic at a friend&#x27;s house and then purchased a mail-order magician&#x27;s kit. After purchasing the kit, Carson practiced his entertainment skills on family members with card tricks. During this period, he would follow his family members around saying, &quot;Pick a card, any card.&quot; Carson&#x27;s mother made him a cape, and his first performance was in front of the local Kiwanis Club. He debuted as &quot;The Great Carsoni&quot; at age 14 and was paid $3 a show.

After graduating from high school, Carson hitchhiked to Hollywood, California. There he was arrested and fined $50 for impersonating a midshipman, a story often regarded as apocryphal.

== Military service ==

Carson joined the United States Navy on June 8, 1943, and received V-12 Navy College Training Program officer training at Columbia University and Millsaps College. Commissioned an ensign late in the war, Carson was assigned to the in the Pacific, serving as a communications officer in charge of decoding encrypted messages. While in the Navy, Carson posted a 15–0-1 amateur boxing record, with most of his bouts fought on board &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. He was en route to the combat zone aboard a troop ship when the war ended.

Carson later said that the high point of his military career was performing a magic trick for U.S. Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal. In a conversation with Forrestal, the Secretary asked Carson if he planned to stay in the Navy after the war. In response, Carson said no and told him he wanted to be a magician. Forrestal asked him to perform, and Carson responded with a card trick. Carson made the discovery that he could entertain and amuse someone as cranky and sophisticated as Forrestal.

== Education ==
Taking advantage of educational opportunities from the Navy, Carson attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, where he joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and continued performing magic (then paid $25 per appearance). Carson majored in journalism with the intention of becoming a comedy writer, but instead switched his major to speech and drama a few months later because he wanted to become a radio performer. His college thesis, titled &quot;How to Write Comedy for Radio&quot;, was a compilation of taped skits and jokes from popular radio shows with Carson explaining the comedic technique in a voice-over. It allowed him to graduate in three years. Carson graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in radio and speech with a minor in physics in 1949.

== Early radio and television ==
Carson began his broadcasting career in 1950 at WOW-AM (now KXSP) and WOW-TV (now WOWT-TV) in Omaha, Nebraska. He soon hosted a morning television program called &quot;The Squirrel&#x27;s Nest&quot;. One of his routines involved interviewing pigeons on the roof of the local courthouse that would report on the political corruption they had seen. Carson supplemented his income by serving as master of ceremonies at local church dinners—attended by some of the same politicians and civic leaders he had lampooned on the radio.
The wife of one of the Omaha political figures that Carson spoofed owned stock in a radio station in Los Angeles, and in 1951 referred Carson to her brother, who was influential in the emerging television market in Southern California. Carson joined CBS-owned Los Angeles television station KNXT (now KCBS-TV).

In 1953, comic Red Skelton—a fan of Carson&#x27;s low-budget sketch comedy show, &quot;Carson&#x27;s Cellar&quot; (1951–1953) on KNXT—asked Carson to join his show as a writer. The following year, Skelton accidentally knocked himself unconscious during rehearsal, an hour before his live show began. Carson successfully filled in for him. In 1955, Jack Benny invited Carson to appear on one of his programs during the opening and closing segments. Carson imitated Benny and claimed that Benny had copied his gestures. Benny predicted that Carson, who readily admitted Benny&#x27;s substantial influence on aspects of his comedic delivery, would have a successful career as a comedian.

Carson hosted several shows besides &quot;Carson&#x27;s Cellar&quot;, including the game show &quot;Earn Your Vacation&quot; (1954) and the variety show &quot;The Johnny Carson Show&quot; (1955–1956). He was a guest panelist on the original &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; beginning in 1960, becoming a regular panelist from 1961 to 1962.

After the primetime &quot;Johnny Carson Show&quot; failed, Carson moved to New York City to host ABC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; (1957–1962). It was on &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; that Carson met his future sidekick and straight man, Ed McMahon. Although Carson believed moving to daytime television would hurt his career, &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; was a success. It was the first show where he could ad lib and interview guests, and because of his on-camera wit, the show became &quot;the hottest item on daytime television&quot; during his six years at ABC. From his experience as a radio host, Carson would later write a parody for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; of former talk show host Dennis Miller having the new role at the time (2000) as an NFL sports announcer, titled &quot;Proverbs of Dennis Miller&quot;.
== &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; ==
NBC&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&quot; was the late-night counterpart to its early-morning show &quot;Today&quot;. Originating in 1954 with host Steve Allen, &quot;Tonight&quot; was somewhat experimental at the time, as the only previous network late-night program was NBC&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Open House&quot; (1950–51), which starred Jerry Lester and Dagmar. &quot;Tonight&quot; was successful. Allen moved to primetime comedy-variety shows in 1957 when Jack Paar became host of &quot;Tonight&quot;. Paar left the show in 1962.

Carson&#x27;s success on &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; led NBC to invite him to take over &quot;Tonight&quot; a few months before Paar&#x27;s departure. Carson declined the offer because he feared the difficulty of interviewing celebrities for 105 minutes each day. Bob Newhart, Jackie Gleason, Groucho Marx and Joey Bishop also declined. NBC finally convinced Carson to sign by early February 1962. He can be seen discussing his upcoming job for the first time on the February 11, 1962, episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. Due to Carson having six months left on his ABC contract, NBC used multiple guest hosts until he could take over. Guest hosts included Bishop, Marx, Merv Griffin, Art Linkletter, Arlene Francis, Bob Cummings, Jerry Lewis, Donald O&#x27;Connor and others.

Although he continued to have doubts about his new job, Carson became the host of &quot;Tonight&quot; (later called &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;) on October 1, 1962. After a difficult first year, he overcame his fears. While &quot;Tonight&quot; under its previous hosts had been successful, especially under Paar, Carson&#x27;s version eventually did very well in the ratings. Billy Wilder said of Carson:


McMahon followed Carson from &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; as his announcer and sidekick, and Skitch Henderson was installed as the maestro of the NBC Orchestra. McMahon&#x27;s famous introduction, &quot;Heeeeere&#x27;s Johnny!!!&quot; was followed by a brief monologue by Carson. This was often followed by comedy sketches, interviews and live music. Carson&#x27;s trademark was a phantom golf swing at the end of his monologues, aimed stage left toward the orchestra. (Guest hosts sometimes parodied that gesture. Newhart rolled an imaginary bowling ball toward the audience.)

Paul Anka wrote &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;″s theme song, (&quot;Johnny&#x27;s Theme&quot;), a reworking of his &quot;Toot Sweet&quot;; given lyrics, it was renamed &quot;It&#x27;s Really Love&quot; and recorded by Annette Funicello in 1959. Before taking over &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Carson wrote lyrics for the song, and so claimed fifty percent of the song&#x27;s performance royalties (though the lyrics were never used). The theme is heard being played on sound recordings of Carson&#x27;s first &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, and it was used without interruption through to his last broadcast on May 22, 1992.

&quot;The Tonight Show&quot; was originally produced at NBC&#x27;s headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, with occasional stints in California. The program began videotaping in advance during the Jack Paar days, although during the 1970s NBC fed the live taping from Burbank to New York via satellite for editing (see below). Carson had a talent for quick quips to deal with problems. If the opening monologue fared poorly, the band would start playing &quot;Tea for Two&quot; and Carson danced a softshoe to laughs from the studio audience. Alternatively, Carson might pull the boom microphone close to his face and announce, &quot;Attention K-Mart shoppers, clean up in aisle four!&quot;

=== Move to Burbank ===
On May 1, 1972, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; moved from 30 Rockefeller Plaza to the NBC Studios in Burbank, California, because of the studio&#x27;s proximity to celebrities.

From 1980, Carson stopped hosting five shows per week. Instead, Mondays featured a guest host, leaving Carson to host the other four weeknights. Shows were videotaped in Burbank at 5:30 pm, fed from there to the Central and Eastern Time Zone stations via cross-country television line at 8:30 pm Pacific time (11:30 pm Eastern time), and later sent from Burbank to the Pacific Time Zone stations at 11:30 pm Pacific time. Since only two feeds originated from Burbank, Central Time Zone stations received the Eastern feed one hour earlier at 10:30 pm local time, and Mountain time stations received the Pacific time zone feed also one hour later, at 12:30 am local time. 
Carson announced in April 1979 that he was leaving &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; after seventeen years hosting the program. At the time, media analysts estimated the show generated 17% of NBC&#x27;s pre-tax profits. He negotiated a three-year deal to remain with the show in May 1980, reducing the program&#x27;s length from ninety to sixty minutes while decreasing his workload from four to three nights each week. Tom Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&quot; added a half-hour to fill the vacant time. Joan Rivers became the &quot;permanent&quot; guest host from September 1983 until 1986. &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; then returned to using rotating guest hosts, including comics George Carlin and Garry Shandling. Jay Leno became the exclusive guest host in fall 1987, later joking that although other guest hosts had upped their fees, he had kept his low, assuring himself more bookings. Eventually, Monday night was reserved for Leno and Tuesday night was reserved for &quot;The Best of Carson&quot;—rebroadcasts usually dating from a year earlier, but occasionally from the 1970s.

Although Carson&#x27;s work schedule became more abbreviated, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; remained so successful that his compensation from NBC continued to rise; by the mid-1970s, he had become the highest-paid personality on television, earning about $4 million a year ($ today), not including nightclub appearances and his other businesses. Carson refused many offers to appear in films, including title roles in &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; and Gene Wilder&#x27;s role in &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;. He also declined director Martin Scorsese&#x27;s offer to co-star with Robert De Niro in the 1983 film &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;, with the role of a TV talk-show host then going to Jerry Lewis.

In recognition of his 25th anniversary on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Carson received a personal Peabody Award, the board saying he had &quot;become an American institution, a household word, [and] the most widely quoted American.&quot; They also said they &quot;felt the time had come to recognize the contributions that Johnny has made to television, to humor, and to America.&quot;

===Uri Geller===
In 1973, television personality and self-proclaimed psychic Uri Geller appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. In the &quot;NOVA&quot; documentary, &quot;James Randi – Secrets of the Psychics,&quot; magician and skeptical activist James Randi recalls that Carson &quot;had been a magician himself and was skeptical&quot; of Geller&#x27;s claimed paranormal powers, and so, prior to the date of taping, Randi was personally asked &quot;to help prevent any trickery.&quot; Per Randi&#x27;s advice, the show&#x27;s staff prepared its own props without informing Geller and did not let Geller or his staff &quot;anywhere near them.&quot; When Geller joined Carson on stage, he appeared surprised that he was not going to be interviewed, but instead was expected to display his abilities using the provided articles. Geller was unable to display any paranormal abilities, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel strong&quot; and expressing displeasure at feeling like he was being &quot;pressed&quot; to perform by Carson. According to Adam Higginbotham&#x27;s November 7, 2014, article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

However, ironically, this appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, which Carson and Randi had orchestrated to debunk Geller&#x27;s claimed abilities, backfired. According to Higginbotham,

=== Comic characters ===

Carson played several continuing characters on sketches during the show, including:
* Art Fern was the &quot;Tea Time Movie&quot; announcer, whose theme song was &quot;Hooray for Hollywood&quot;. Carson once admitted on camera that this was his favorite character, based on late-afternoon and evening TV movie hosts who would deliver commercials throughout the movie. Each sketch usually featured three long commercials interrupted by four-second clips from old silent films. When the camera returned from each clip, Art was always caught off-guard and immediately reminded viewers that they were watching a film favorite. The movies always had unlikely casts and even less likely titles: &quot;Slim Pickens, Patti Page, &#x27;Duke&#x27; John Wayne and Charlton Heston in another classic Western: &#x27;Kiss My Saddle Horn&#x27;!&quot; Carson originally played the fast-talking huckster in his own voice (as Honest Bernie Schlock or Ralph Willie), and finally settled on a nasal, high-pitched, smarmy drone, reminiscent of Jackie Gleason&#x27;s &quot;Reginald Van Gleason III&quot; character, known as Art Fern, wearing a lavish toupee, loud jackets, and a pencil mustache. Actress Carol Wayne became famous for her 100-plus appearances (1971–1984) as Art&#x27;s buxom assistant, the Matinée Lady. While Art gave his spiel, she would enter the stage behind him. Art would react to her attractive body by wincing, loudly shouting &quot;&quot;Ho&quot; — leeeee!&quot; and turning almost everything she said into a sexual double entendre. After Carol Wayne&#x27;s accidental death in 1985, Carson kept Art Fern off the air for most of the next year, and finally hired Danuta Wesley and then Teresa Ganzel to play the Matinée Lady. Carson also used these sketches to poke fun at the intricate Los Angeles interstate system, using a pointer and map to give confusing directions to shoppers, often including points where he would unfold the cardboard map to point out, via the appropriate picture, when the shopper would arrive at &quot;the fork in the road&quot;. Another freeway routine in the same theme centered on the &quot;Slauson Cutoff&quot;, a slang term Carson popularized to describe the truncated Marina Freeway (which ended abruptly at Slauson Avenue in Culver City). Art Fern would advise drivers to take a series of freeways until they reached the Slauson Cutoff, and would then advise them to &quot;Get out of your car, cut off your slauson, get back in your car,&quot; often followed by peals of laughter from the audience, led by McMahon.
* Carnac the Magnificent, a turbaned psychic, could answer questions before seeing them. Carnac had a trademark entrance in which he always turned the wrong direction when coming onstage and then tripped on the step up to Carson&#x27;s desk. (In one episode, technicians rigged Carson&#x27;s desk to fall apart when Carnac fell into it.) These comedic missteps were an indication of Carnac&#x27;s true prescient abilities. McMahon would hand Carson a series of envelopes containing questions, said to have been &quot;hermetically sealed and kept in a mayonnaise jar on Funk &amp; Wagnalls&#x27; porch since noon today.&quot; Carson would place each envelope against his forehead and predict the answer, such as &quot;Gatorade&quot;. Then, he would read the question: &quot;What does an alligator get on welfare?&quot; Some of the jokes were feeble, and McMahon used pauses after terrible puns and audience groans to make light of Carson&#x27;s lack of comic success (&quot;Carnac must be used to quiet surroundings&quot;), prompting Carson to return an equal insult. Pat McCormick wrote some of the zaniest Carnac material. The one that had McMahon and Carson nearly rolling on the floor with sustained laughter was &quot;Sis boom bah&quot;. Answer – &quot;Describe the sound made when a sheep explodes.&quot; McMahon would always announce near the end, &quot;I hold in my hand the &quot;last&quot; envelope,&quot; at which the audience would applaud wildly, prompting Carnac to pronounce a comedic &quot;curse&quot; on the audience, such as, &quot;May a flock of wild geese leave a deposit on your breakfast!&quot;, &quot;May your sister elope with a camel!&quot;, &quot;May a diseased yak take a liking to your sister&quot;, or the most famous: &quot;May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!&quot; The character was taken from Steve Allen&#x27;s essentially identical &quot;Answer Man&quot; segment, which Allen performed during his tenure as host of &quot;Tonight&quot; in the 1950s. As Allen acknowledged in his book &quot;The Question Man&quot;, this bit had been created in Kansas City in 1951 by Bob Arbogast and used on &quot;The Tom Poston Show&quot; in New York where it eventually ended up on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, much to the surprise of both Bob and Steve. The Carnac character and routine also closely resemble Ernie Kovacs&#x27; &quot;Mr. Question Man&quot;.
* Floyd R. Turbo American (with no pause between words) was a stereotypical common working man, wearing a plaid hunting coat and cap, who offered &quot;editorial responses&quot; to left-leaning causes or news events. Railing against women&#x27;s rights in the workplace, for example, Turbo would shout: &quot;This raises the question: kiss my Dictaphone!&quot;
* Aunt Blabby, a cantankerous and sometimes amorous old lady, was invariably interviewed by straight man Ed McMahon about elder affairs. McMahon would innocently use a common expression like &quot;check out&quot;, only to have Aunt Blabby warn him: &quot;Don&#x27;t say &#x27;check out&#x27; to an old person!&quot; Aunt Blabby was an obvious copy of Jonathan Winters&#x27; most famous creation, Maude Frickert, including her black spinster dress and wig.
* El Mouldo, a mentalist, would attempt to perform mind-reading and mind-over-matter feats, all of which failed. Often, his tricks would include an attempt to bilk money from Ed McMahon or would end with his begging the audience for a dollar, or at least bus fare.
* The Maharishi, whose theme song was &quot;Song of India&quot;, was a frizzy-haired &quot;holy man&quot; who spoke in a high-pitched, tranquil tone, greeted announcer McMahon with a flower, and answered philosophical questions. This was a take-off on Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

=== Carson uncensored on satellite ===
Although Carson&#x27;s program moved to Burbank in 1972, NBC&#x27;s editing and production services for the show remained in New York, requiring that the program be transmitted between the two cities. In 1976, NBC used the Satcom 2 satellite to achieve this, feeding the live taping (which started around 5:30 pm local time) directly to New York, where it would be edited prior to the late-night broadcast. This live feed lasted usually for two to two-and-a-half hours a night and was both uncensored and commercial-free. During the slots for commercial breaks, the audio and picture feed would continue, capturing at times risqué language and other events that would be edited out before transmission.

At the same time, satellite ground stations owned by individuals began appearing, and some found the live feed. Satellite dish owners began to document their sightings in technical journals, giving viewers knowledge of things they were not meant to see. Carson and his production staff grew concerned about this and pressured NBC into ceasing the satellite transmissions of the live taping in the early 1980s. The satellite link was replaced by microwave transmission until the show&#x27;s editing facilities were moved to Burbank.

== Filmography ==
=== Television work as character ===
Carson played himself in the 1964 film &quot;Looking for Love&quot;. Carson also played an assassin of comedians in the 1970s Bob Hope television special &quot;Joys!&quot; Guests on the broadcast included Groucho Marx, George Burns, Telly Savalas, Milton Berle, Red Buttons, Don Adams, and Steve Allen.

== Controversies and feuds ==
Carson often made jokes at the expense of other celebrities. In 1980, Carson backed out of a deal to acquire the Aladdin Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, and a competing group led by Wayne Newton bought the property. According to lawyer Henry Bushkin, Carson became annoyed that he was portrayed in the media as having &quot;lost&quot; the deal and reacted by telling jokes on his show about Newton. This led to a feud between Carson and Newton. Years later, Newton appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, declaring that &quot;Johnny Carson is a mean-spirited human being. And there are people that he has hurt that people will never know about. And for some reason at some point, he decided to turn that kind of negative attention toward me. And I refused to have it.&quot; Newton has often told of confronting Carson; ultimately, Newton barged into Carson&#x27;s office at the NBC studios and threatened to beat him up unless he stopped making such jokes.

On February 27, 1982, Carson was arrested for drunk driving on La Cienega Boulevard, near Beverly Hills; he was released on his own recognizance. Carson pleaded no contest to the charges and, in October 1982, received a sentence of three years probation, was fined $603, and was required to attend a driver&#x27;s education alcohol program. Carson&#x27;s driving privilege was restricted to driving only to and from work and alcohol education classes for a period of 90 days.
&quot;Perry Mason&quot; actor Raymond Burr became angry over Carson&#x27;s continuing jokes about his weight, and he appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; only twice, in 1968 and 1976.

On July 2, 1969, Carson launched an on-air attack on &quot;The New York Times&quot; after his nightly monologue, assailing the newspaper for an article saying that he was the highest-paid performer on television, earning $75,000 () a week. He denied that was so, while declining to reveal his compensation in a subsequent interview with the newspaper, and called the article &quot;damned unfair.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; published a follow-up article saying that its initial reporter &quot;erred&quot;, and that $75,000 a week was unlikely.

Carson reportedly loathed what he perceived as disloyalty, and he was furious when former frequent &quot;Tonight Show&quot; guest hosts John Davidson and Joan Rivers began hosting their own talk shows. Rivers&#x27; show on the Fox Network directly competed with Carson during the 1986–1987 season before being cancelled. On June 24, 2009, following Ed McMahon&#x27;s death, Rivers lauded McMahon on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, but said that after she got her own show, Carson refused to ever speak to her again.

In December 1973, Carson joked on &quot;Tonight&quot; about an alleged shortage of toilet paper. Viewers believed the story and panic buying and hoarding ensued across the United States as consumers emptied stores, causing a real shortage that lasted for weeks. Stores and toilet paper manufacturers had to ration supplies until the panic ended. Carson apologized in January 1974 for the incident, which became what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called a &quot;classic study&quot; of how rumors spread. Carson called references in the article to him &quot;very unfair&quot;.

Carson successfully sued a manufacturer of portable toilets that wanted to call its product &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny&quot;.

Carson performed a parody of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;. Rogers noted, &quot;I&#x27;ve told Johnny that I like humor as much as anybody. But what concerns me is the takeoffs that make me seem so &quot;wimpy&quot;! I hope it doesn&#x27;t communicate that Mr. Rogers is just somebody to be made fun of. Only people who take the time to see our work can begin to understand the depth of it.&quot; Carson later apologized to Rogers for making fun of him.

== Business ventures ==
In 1979, Carson invested $500,000 () in the DeLorean Motor Company. Additionally, Carson was head of a group of investors who purchased and operated two television stations. The first was KVVU-TV in Henderson, Nevada, an independent station serving Las Vegas, acquired by the Carson group in 1979. Shortly after buying the station, KVVU was rumored to be acquiring an NBC affiliation because long-time affiliate KORK-TV was in the process of being replaced by KVBC (and KSNV), but it never happened. Carson&#x27;s second station, independent KNAT-TV in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was purchased in 1982. Unlike the Las Vegas operation, KNAT faced stiffer competition for top-quality, syndicated programming. Carson sold both of his stations in 1985 and 1986, with KVVU-TV (FOX 5) going to the Meredith Corporation and KNAT being sold to Trinity Broadcasting Network.

Carson&#x27;s other business ventures included the successful Johnny Carson Apparel, Inc.—his turtlenecks became a fashion trend—and a failed restaurant franchise.

== Retirement ==
Carson retired from show business on May 22, 1992, at age 66, when he stepped down as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. His farewell was a major media event, often emotional for Carson, his colleagues, and the audiences, and stretched over several nights. In tribute to Carson and his enormous influence, several networks that had late-night variety talk shows &quot;went dark&quot; for the entire hour he did the last show. After 13 tries, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; finally won the Emmy for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series later that year, buoyed by the penultimate broadcast, which featured Johnny&#x27;s final two guests: Robin Williams and Bette Midler.

NBC gave the role of host to the show&#x27;s then-current permanent guest host, Jay Leno. Leno and David Letterman were soon competing on separate networks.

=== Post-retirement appearances ===

At the end of his final &quot;Tonight Show&quot; episode, Carson indicated that he might, if so inspired, return with a new project. Instead, he chose to go into full retirement, rarely giving interviews and declining to participate in NBC&#x27;s 75th-anniversary celebrations. He made an occasional cameo appearance, including voicing himself on the May 13, 1993, episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;), telephoning David Letterman on a November 1993 episode of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and appearing in the 1993 NBC special &quot;Bob Hope: The First 90 Years&quot;.

On May 13, 1994, Carson appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. During a week of shows from Los Angeles, Letterman was having Larry &quot;Bud&quot; Melman (Calvert DeForest) deliver his &quot;Top Ten Lists&quot; under the guise that a famous personality would be delivering the list instead. On the last show of the week, Letterman indicated that Carson would be delivering the list. Instead, DeForest delivered the list, insulted the audience (in keeping with the gag), and walked off to polite applause. Letterman then indicated that the card he was given did not have the proper list on it and asked that the &quot;real&quot; list be brought out. On that cue, the real Carson emerged from behind the curtain (as Letterman&#x27;s band played &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Theme&quot;), an appearance that prompted a 90-second standing ovation from the audience. Carson then asked to sit behind Letterman&#x27;s desk; Letterman obliged, as the audience continued to cheer and applaud. After some moments, Carson departed from the show without having spoken to the audience. He later cited acute laryngitis as the reason for his silence. This turned out to be Carson&#x27;s last television appearance.

Carson played tennis throughout his retirement.

Carson also reviewed clips of the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; included in DVD compilations, and he had humor pieces published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

=== Letterman ===
Prior to his death, Carson occasionally sent jokes to David Letterman. Letterman would then use these jokes in the monologue of his show, which Carson got &quot;a big kick out of&quot;, according to Worldwide Pants Inc. senior vice president Peter Lassally, who formerly produced both men&#x27;s programs. He also said Carson had always believed Letterman, not Leno, to be his &quot;rightful successor&quot;. In his first broadcast after Carson&#x27;s death, Letterman delivered a monologue compiled entirely of jokes sent in by Carson, a fact the host revealed a short time later in the program.

== Influences ==
Carson&#x27;s influences included Jack Benny, Red Skelton, Fred Allen, Bob Hope, Groucho Marx, and Jack Paar.

== Legacy and impact on popular culture ==
Carson&#x27;s show launched the careers of many performers, especially comedians and musicians. For a comedian appearing on the show, getting Carson to laugh and being invited to the guest chair were considered the highest honors. Notable among these were David Letterman, Freddie Prinze, Robin Williams, Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, Arsenio Hall, Jeff Foxworthy, Ellen DeGeneres, Rodney Dangerfield, Joan Rivers, David Brenner, Tim Allen, Drew Carey, Howie Mandel, Roseanne Barr and Don Rickles. Carson was successor to &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; as a showcase for different types of talent, as well as continuing a vaudeville-style variety show.

In 1966, Carson popularized Milton Bradley&#x27;s game &quot;Twister&quot; when he played it with actress Eva Gabor. Not widely known up to that time, the game skyrocketed in popularity after the broadcast.

Comedians who credit Carson as an influence include David Letterman, Jay Leno, Conan O&#x27;Brien, Dennis Miller, Bill Maher, Joan Rivers, Larry Wilmore, Ray Romano, Don Rickles, Bob Newhart, Angie Dickinson, Carl Reiner, Mel Brooks, Dick Cavett, Norm Macdonald, David Steinberg, Jerry Seinfeld, Ellen DeGeneres, Garry Shandling, Steve Martin, Ray Combs, Arsenio Hall, Craig Ferguson, Orson Bean, and Jimmy Fallon.

Brian Wilson was an avid fan of the show and in 1977 wrote a song titled &quot;Johnny Carson&quot; as a tribute. It was released on the &quot;Beach Boys Love You&quot; album.

In 1983 he was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership.

== Personal life ==
Despite his on-camera demeanor, Carson was introverted and shy off camera. He was known@ for avoiding most large parties and was called &quot;the most private public man who ever lived.&quot; Dick Cavett recalled, &quot;I felt sorry for Johnny in that he was so socially uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve hardly ever met anybody who had as hard a time as he did.&quot; In addition, George Axelrod once said of Carson, &quot;Socially, he doesn&#x27;t exist. The reason is that there are no television cameras in living rooms. If human beings had little red lights in the middle of their foreheads, Carson would be the greatest conversationalist on Earth.&quot;

He normally refused to discuss politics, social controversies, his childhood, and his private life with interviewers, and offered a list of written answers to journalists who wanted to ask him questions. Among them were &quot;Yes, I did,&quot; &quot;No, I didn&#x27;t,&quot; and &quot;No. kumquats.&quot;

=== Politics ===

Carson opposed the Vietnam War and capital punishment, favored racial equality, and was against criminalizing extramarital sex and pornography. He avoided explicitly mentioning his views on &quot;The Tonight Show,&quot; saying he &quot;hates to be pinned down&quot; as that would &quot;hurt me as an entertainer, which is what I am.&quot; As he explained in 1970, &quot;In my living room I would argue for liberalization of abortion laws, divorce laws, and there are times when I would like to express a view on the air. I would love to have taken on Billy Graham. But I&#x27;m on TV five nights a week; I have nothing to gain by it and everything to lose.&quot; He also seldom invited political figures onto the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; because he &quot;didn&#x27;t want it to become a political forum&quot; and did not want the show used, by himself or others, to influence the opinions of the viewers.

In his book, Carson&#x27;s former lawyer Henry Bushkin stated, he &quot;was by instinct and upbringing definitely Republican, but of an Eisenhower sort that we don&#x27;t see much of anymore ... Overall, you&#x27;d have to say he was anti-big: anti-big government, anti-big money, anti-big bullies, anti-big blowhards.&quot; Carson served as MC for Ronald Reagan&#x27;s inaugural gala in 1981 at the request of Frank Sinatra.

=== Legal issue ===
In October 1982, Carson pled no contest to a misdemeanor count of driving with a blood alcohol level above the legal limit, while the charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and driving without a license were withdrawn by the prosecution. This case stemmed from an arrest in February 1982. After having been pulled over by police shortly after leaving an Italian restaurant with his wife, Carson was fined $603 and placed on three years of probation. Municipal Court Judge David Kidney ordered Carson to attend a driver&#x27;s education alcohol program and restricted his license for 90 days to trips to and from work and those classes. Though his lawyer Robert Shapiro advised Carson to take his case to trial believing they had a winning case, Carson was looking to move on from the scandal and wanted to avoid the media attention that a trial would bring. Carson commented on the matter in a monologue of the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; saying, &quot;I regret the incident, And I&#x27;ll tell you one thing, You will never see me do that again.&quot;

=== Religion ===
As an adult, Carson was not a regular churchgoer, although during his childhood he was raised as a Methodist and during high school attended Christian Endeavor meetings at the local church.

=== Marriages ===
In October 1949, Carson married Jody Wolcott in North Platte, Nebraska. The marriage was volatile, with infidelities committed by both parties, and ended in divorce in 1963.

Carson married Joanne Copeland the same year, on August 17. After a second protracted divorce in 1972, Copeland received a settlement of $6,000 per month in alimony until she remarried or until Carson&#x27;s death (she received it until his death in 2005). She also received &quot;a pretty nice little art collection.&quot; She later had a second marriage that also ended in divorce, and died in California, aged 83, in 2015. She had no children.

At the Carson &quot;Tonight Show&quot; 10th-anniversary party on September 30, 1972, Carson announced that former model Joanna Holland and he had been secretly married that afternoon, shocking his friends and associates. On March 8, 1983, Holland filed for divorce. The divorce case finally ended in 1985 with an 80-page settlement, with Holland receiving $20 million in cash and property ().

On June 20, 1987, Carson married Alexis Maas. The marriage lasted until his death in 2005.

Carson reportedly joked, &quot;My giving advice on marriage is like the captain of the &quot;Titanic&quot; giving lessons on navigation.&quot;

=== Children ===

Carson had three sons with his first wife.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 1981, Carson created the John W. Carson Foundation, dedicated to supporting children, education, and health services. In August 2010, his charitable foundation reported receiving $156 million () from a personal trust established by the entertainer years before his 2005 death, thus becoming by far the largest Hollywood charity. , the foundation continues to support charitable causes.

In November 2004, Carson announced a $5.3 million gift to the University of Nebraska Foundation to support the Hixson–Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts Department of Theater Arts, which created the Johnny Carson School of Theater and Film. Another $5 million donation was announced by the estate of Carson to the University of Nebraska following his death, while a $1 million donation was announced on November 4, 2011, creating the Johnny Carson Opportunity Scholarship Fund. The foundation made another $5 million donation to the university on October 22, 2021, to augment the Opportunity Scholarship Fund.

Carson also donated to causes in his hometown of Norfolk, including the Carson Cancer Center at Faith Regional Health Services, the Elkhorn Valley Museum, and the Johnny Carson Theater at Norfolk Senior High School. Carson also donated to the Northeast Community College Lifelong Learning Center in honor of his favorite teacher, Miss Fay Gordon. Miss Gordon had appeared on his show a number of times. His last known visit to Norfolk was to throw the 100th-birthday party for Miss Gordon, which Carson had promised to do several years earlier.

=== Other interests ===
Carson, an amateur astronomer, was a close friend of astronomer Carl Sagan, who often appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. The unique way Sagan had of saying certain words, like &quot;billions&quot; of stars, would lead Carson to ribbing his friend, saying &quot;BILL-ions and BILL-ions&quot;. Carson was the first person to contact Sagan&#x27;s wife Ann Druyan with condolences when the scientist died in 1996. He owned several telescopes, including a top-of-the-line unit. In 1981, the minor planet 1981 EM4 was named in his honor, 3252 Johnny. That year, a star was also nicknamed after Carson.

Carson was an amateur drummer and was shown on a 1979 segment of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; practicing at home on a drum set given to him by his close friend Buddy Rich, who was the jazz musician with the most appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Gore Vidal, another frequent &quot;Tonight Show&quot; guest and friend, wrote about Carson&#x27;s personality in his 2006 memoir.

Carson was an avid tennis player. When he sold a Malibu house to John McEnroe and Tatum O&#x27;Neal, the escrow terms required McEnroe to give Johnny six tennis lessons. Carson&#x27;s primary tennis teacher was Bob Trapenberg, who taught him for some time, and traveled with him to Wimbledon.

Carson was also a private pilot; his flight logbook and jacket were donated after his death to the Experimental Aircraft Association in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

== Final years, death and tributes ==

On March 19, 1999, Carson suffered a severe heart attack at his home in Malibu, California, and was hospitalized in nearby Santa Monica, where he underwent quadruple-bypass surgery.

Carson had been a heavy smoker for decades, and in the early days of his tenure on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, he often smoked on-camera, at one point having smoked four packs of Pall Mall cigarettes a day. It was reported that as early as the mid-1970s, he would repeatedly say, &quot;These things are killing me.&quot; His younger brother recalled that during their last conversation, Carson kept saying, &quot;Those damn cigarettes.&quot;

In 2002, he turned down an offer to appear at NBC&#x27;s 75th anniversary.

In September 2002, Carson revealed that he had emphysema but denied he was terminally ill. On January 23, 2005, Carson died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles of respiratory failure arising from emphysema. His body was cremated, and the ashes were given to his wife, Alexis Maas. In accordance with his family&#x27;s wishes, no public memorial service was held. Carson was also survived by his younger brother, Dick, who was an Emmy Award–winning director of, among other things, the competing &quot;Merv Griffin Show&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;.

Numerous tributes were paid to Carson upon his death, including a statement by then-President George W. Bush, all recognizing the deep and enduring affection held for him.

On January 31, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; paid tribute with former &quot;Tonight Show&quot; executive producer Peter Lassally and bandleader Doc Severinsen. At the beginning of this show, Letterman said that for 30 years, no matter what was going on in the world, whether people had had a good or bad day, they wanted to end it being &quot;tucked in by Johnny.&quot; He also told his viewers that the monologue he had just performed, which was very well received by the studio audience, consisted entirely of jokes sent to him by Carson in the last few months of his life. Doc Severinsen ended the Letterman show that night by conducting and playing, along with Tommy Newsom and Ed Shaughnessy, one of Carson&#x27;s two favorite songs, &quot;Here&#x27;s That Rainy Day&quot; (the other was &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot;). &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; also paid tribute to Carson with guests Ed McMahon, Bob Newhart, Don Rickles, Drew Carey, and k.d. lang.

On his final &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance, Carson himself said that while sometimes people who work together for long stretches of time on television do not necessarily like each other, this was not the case with McMahon; he and McMahon were good friends who would have drinks and dinner together, and the camaraderie they had on the show could not be faked. Their friendship spanned 46 years.

The 2005 film &quot;The Aristocrats&quot; was dedicated to Carson.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; seventh episode of season 16, entitled &quot;Mommie Beerest&quot;, was dedicated to his memory.

At the first Comedy Awards on Comedy Central, the Johnny Carson Award was given to David Letterman. At the 2nd Annual Comedy Awards on Comedy Central, the Johnny Carson Award was given to Don Rickles.

A two-hour documentary about his life, &quot;Johnny Carson: King of Late Night&quot;, aired on PBS on May 14, 2012, as part of PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Masters&quot; series. It is narrated by Kevin Spacey and features interviews with many of Carson&#x27;s family, fellow comedians, and protégés.

A park is named in his memory in Burbank, across from the former NBC Studios.

<text>A canoe is a lightweight, narrow water vessel, typically pointed at both ends and open on top, propelled by one or more seated or kneeling paddlers facing the direction of travel and using paddles.

In British English, the term &quot;canoe&quot; can also refer to a kayak, whereas canoes are then called Canadian or open canoes to distinguish them from kayaks. However, for official competition purposes, the American distinction between a kayak and a canoe is almost always adopted. At the Olympics, both conventions are used: under the umbrella terms Canoe Slalom and Canoe Sprint, there are separate events for canoes and kayaks.

==Culture==

Canoes were developed in cultures all over the world, including some designed for use with sails or outriggers. Until the mid-19th century, the canoe was an important means of transport for exploration and trade, and in some places is still used as such, sometimes with the addition of an outboard motor.

Where the canoe played a key role in history, such as the Northern United States, Canada, and New Zealand, it remains an important theme in popular culture. For instance, the birch bark canoe of the largely birch-based culture of the First Nations of Quebec, Canada, and North America provided these hunting peoples with the mobility essential to this way of life.

Canoes are now widely used for competition — indeed, canoeing has been part of the Olympics since 1936— and pleasure, such as racing, whitewater, touring and camping, freestyle and general recreation.

The intended use of the canoe dictates its hull shape, length, and construction material. Although canoes were historically dugouts or made of bark on a wood frame, construction materials later evolved to canvas on a wood frame, then to aluminum. Most modern canoes are made of molded plastic or composites such as fiberglass, or those incorporating kevlar or graphite.

==History==

The word &quot;canoe&quot; came into English from the French word &quot;casnouey&quot; adopted from the Saint-Lawrence Iroquoians language in the 1535 Jacques Cartier Relations translated in 1600 by the English geographer Richard Hackluyt.

=== Dugouts ===
Many peoples have made dugout canoes throughout history, carving them out of a single piece of wood: either a whole trunk or a slab of trunk from particularly large trees. Dugout canoes go back to ancient times. The Dufuna canoe, discovered in Nigeria, dates back to 8500–8000 BC. The Pesse canoe, discovered in the Netherlands, dates back to 8200–7600 BC. Excavations in Denmark reveal the use of dugouts and paddles during the Ertebølle period, ().

Canoes played a vital role in the colonisation of the pre-Columbian Caribbean, as they were the only means of reaching the Caribbean Islands from mainland South America. Around 3500 BC, ancient Amerindian groups colonised the first Caribbean Islands using single-hulled canoes. Only a few pre-Columbian Caribbean canoes have been found. Several families of trees could have been used to construct Caribbean canoes, including woods of the mahogany family (Meliaceae) such as the Cuban mahogany (&quot;Swietenia mahagoni&quot;), that can grow up to 30–35 m tall and the red cedar (&quot;Cedrela odorata&quot;), that can grow up to 60 m tall, as well as the &quot;ceiba&quot; genus (Malvacae), such as &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;, that can reach 60–70 m in height. It is likely that these canoes were built in a variety of sizes, ranging from fishing canoes holding just one or a few people to larger ones able to carry as many as a few dozen, and could have been used to reach the Caribbean Islands from the mainland. Reports by historical chroniclers claim to have witnessed a canoe &quot;containing 40 to 50 Caribs [...] when it came out to trade with a visiting English ship&quot;.

There is still much dispute regarding the use of sails in Caribbean canoes. Some archaeologists doubt that oceanic transportation would have been possible without the use of sails, as winds and currents would have carried the canoes off course. However, no evidence of a sail or a Caribbean canoe that could have made use of a sail has been found. Furthermore, no historical sources mention Caribbean canoes with sails. One possibility could be that canoes with sails were initially used in the Caribbean but later abandoned before European contact. This, however, seems unlikely, as long-distance trade continued in the Caribbean even after the prehistoric colonisation of the islands. Hence, it is likely that early Caribbean colonists made use of canoes without sails.

Native American groups of the north Pacific coast made dugout canoes in a number of styles for different purposes, from western red cedar (&quot;Thuja plicata&quot;) or yellow cedar (&quot;Chamaecyparis nootkatensis&quot;), depending on availability. Different styles were required for ocean-going vessels versus river boats, and for whale-hunting versus seal-hunting versus salmon-fishing. The Quinault of Washington State built shovel-nose canoes with double bows, for river travel that could slide over a logjam without needing to be portaged. The Kootenai of the Canadian province of British Columbia made sturgeon-nosed canoes from pine bark, designed to be stable in windy conditions on Kootenay Lake.

In recent years, First Nations in British Columbia and Washington State have been revitalizing the ocean-going canoe tradition. Beginning in the 1980s, the Heiltsuk and Haida were early leaders in this movement. The Paddle to Expo 86 in Vancouver by the Heiltsuk and the 1989 Paddle to Seattle by multiple Native American tribes on the occasion of Washington State&#x27;s centennial year were early instances of this. In 1993 a large number of canoes paddled from up and down the coast to Bella Bella in its first canoe festival – Qatuwas. The revitalization continued, and Tribal Journeys began with trips to various communities held in most years.

Aboriginal Australian people made canoes from hollowed out tree trunks, as well as from tree bark. The indigenous people of the Amazon commonly used Hymenaea (Fabaceae) trees.

=== Bark canoes ===
==== Australia ====
Some Aboriginal Australian peoples made bark canoes. They could be made only from the bark of certain trees (usually red gum or box gum) and during summer. After cutting the outline of the required size and shape, a digging stick was used to cut through the bark to the hardwood, and the bark was then slowly prised out using numerous smaller sticks. The slab of bark was held in place by branches or handwoven rope, and after separation from the tree, lowered to the ground. Small fires would then be lit on the inside of the bark to cause the bark to dry out and curl upwards, after which the ends could be pulled together and stitched with hemp and plugged with mud. It was then allowed to mature, with frequent applications of grease and ochre. The remaining tree was later dubbed a canoe tree by Europeans.

Because of the porosity of the bark, these bark canoes did not last too long (about two years). They were mainly used for fishing or crossing rivers and lakes to avoid long journeys. They were usually propelled by punting with a long stick. Another type of bark canoe was made out of a type of stringybark gum known as Messmate stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus obliqua&quot;), pleating the bark and tying it at each end, with a framework of cross-ties and ribs. This type was known as a pleated or tied bark canoe. Bark strips could also be sewn together to make larger canoes, known as sewn bark canoes.

==== Americas ====
Many indigenous peoples of the Americas built bark canoes. They were usually skinned with birch bark over a light wooden frame, but other types could be used if birch was scarce. At a typical length of and weight of , the canoes were light enough to be portaged, yet could carry a lot of cargo, even in shallow water. Although susceptible to damage from rocks, they are easily repaired. Their performance qualities were soon recognized by early European settler colonials, and canoes played a key role in the exploration of North America, with Samuel de Champlain canoeing as far as the Georgian Bay in 1615.

In 1603 a canoe was brought to Sir Robert Cecil&#x27;s house in London and rowed on the Thames by Virginian Indians from Tsenacommacah. In 1643 David Pietersz. de Vries recorded a Mohawk canoe in Dutch possession at Rensselaerswyck capable of transporting 225 bushels of maize. René de Bréhant de Galinée, a French missionary who explored the Great Lakes in 1669, declared: &quot;The convenience of these canoes is great in these waters, full of cataracts or waterfalls, and rapids through which it is impossible to take any boat. When you reach them you load canoe and baggage upon your shoulders and go overland until the navigation is good; and then you put your canoe back into the water, and embark again.&quot; American painter, author and traveler George Catlin wrote that the bark canoe was &quot;the most beautiful and light model of all the water crafts that ever were invented&quot;.

The first explorer to cross the North American continent, Alexander Mackenzie, used canoes extensively, as did David Thompson and the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

In the North American fur trade, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s voyageurs used three types of canoe:

* The rabaska (French: &quot;canot du maître,&quot; from the surname of Louise Le Maître, an artisan in the Province of Quebec, though the term would literally mean &quot;master canoe&quot; otherwise) — also referred to as the &quot;Montreal canoe — was designed for the long haul from the St. Lawrence River to western Lake Superior. Its dimensions were length, approximately ; beam, ; and height, about . It could carry 60 packs weighing , and of provisions. With a crew of eight or ten paddling or rowing, they could make three knots over calm waters. Four to six men could portage it, bottom up. Henry Schoolcraft declared it &quot;altogether one of the most eligible modes of conveyance that can be employed upon the lakes&quot;. Archibald McDonald of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company wrote: &quot;I never heard of such a canoe being wrecked, or upset, or swamped ... they swam like ducks.&quot;
* The du nord&quot; (French: &quot;canoe of the north&quot;), a craft specially made and adapted for speedy travel, was the workhorse of the fur trade transportation system. About half the size of the rabaska, it could carry about 35 packs weighing and was manned by four to eight men. It could in turn be carried by two men and was portaged in the upright position.
* The express canoe (French: &quot; léger,&quot; light canoe) was about long and was used to carry people, reports, and news.
The birch bark canoe was used in a supply route from Montreal to the Pacific Ocean and the Mackenzie River, and continued to be used up to the end of the 19th century.

The indigenous peoples of eastern Canada and the northeast United States made canoes using the bark of the paper birch, which was harvested in early spring by stripping off the bark in one piece, using wooden wedges. Next, the two ends (stem and stern) were sewn together and made watertight with the pitch of balsam fir. The ribs of the canoe, called &quot;verons&quot; in Canadian French, were made of white cedar, and the hull, ribs, and thwarts were fastened using watap, a binding usually made from the roots of various species of conifers, such as the white spruce, black spruce, or cedar, and caulked with pitch.

=== Skin canoes ===
Skin canoes are constructed using animal skins stretched over a framework. Examples include the kayak and umiak.

=== Modern canoes ===
In 19th-century North America, the birch-on-frame construction technique evolved into the wood-and-canvas canoes made by fastening an external waterproofed canvas shell to planks and ribs by boat builders such as Old Town Canoe, E. M. White Canoe, Peterborough Canoe Company and at the Chestnut Canoe Company in New Brunswick. Though similar to bark canoes in the use of ribs, and a waterproof covering, the construction method is different, being built by bending ribs over a solid mold. Once removed from the mold, the decks, thwarts and seats are installed, and canvas is stretched tightly over the hull. The canvas is then treated with a combination of varnishes and paints to render it more durable and watertight.

Although canoes were once primarily a means of transport, with industrialization they became popular as recreational or sporting watercraft. John MacGregor popularized canoeing through his books, founding the Royal Canoe Club in London in 1866 and the American Canoe Association in 1880. The Canadian Canoe Association was founded in 1900 and the British Canoe Union in 1936. In Sweden, naval officer Carl Smith was both an enthusiastic promoter of canoeing and a designer of canoes, some experimental, at the end of the 19th century.

Sprint canoe was a demonstration sport at the 1924 Paris Olympics and became an Olympic discipline at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. When the International Canoe Federation was formed in 1946, it became the umbrella organization of all national canoe organizations worldwide.

==Hull design==
Hull design must meet different, often conflicting, requirements for speed, carrying capacity, maneuverability, and stability The canoe&#x27;s hull speed can be calculated using the principles of ship resistance and propulsion.

* Length: although this is often stated by manufacturers as the overall length of the boat, what counts in performance terms is the length of the waterline, and more specifically its value relative to the displacement (the amount of water displaced by the boat) of the canoe, which is equal to the total weight of the boat and its contents because a floating body displaces its own weight in water. When a canoe is paddled through water, effort is required to push all the displaced water out of the way. Canoes are displacement hulls: the longer the waterline relative to its displacement, the faster it can be paddled. Among general touring canoeists, is a popular length, providing a good compromise between capacity and cruising speed. Too large a canoe will simply mean extra work paddling at cruising speed.
*Width (beam): a wider boat provides more stability at the expense of speed. A canoe cuts through the water like a wedge, and a shorter boat needs a narrower beam to reduce the angle of the wedge cutting through the water. Canoe manufacturers typically provide three beam measurements: the gunwale (the measurement at the top of the hull), the waterline (the measurement at the point where the surface of the water meets the hull when it is empty), and the widest point. Another variation of the waterline beam measurement is called &quot;4&quot; waterline&quot;, where the displacement is taken into account. This measurement is done at the waterline level when the maximum load is applied to the canoe. Some canoe races use the 4&quot; waterline beam measurement as the standard for their regulations. In races, the measurement is done by measuring the widest point at 4&quot; (10 cm) from the bottom of the canoe. 
* Freeboard: a higher-sided boat stays drier in rough water. The disadvantage of high sides is extra weight and extra windage. Increased windage adversely affects speed and steering control in crosswinds.
* Stability and immersed bottom shape: the hull can be optimized for initial stability (the boat feels steady when it sits flat on the water) or final stability (resistance to rolling and capsizing). A flatter-bottomed hull has higher initial stability, versus a rounder or V-shaped hull in cross-section has high final stability. The fastest flat water non-racing canoes have sharp V-bottoms to cut through the water, but they are difficult to turn and have a deeper draft, which makes them less suitable for shallows. Flat-bottomed canoes are most popular among recreational canoeists. At the cost of speed, they have a shallow draft and more cargo space, and they turn better. The reason a flat bottom canoe has lower final stability is that the hull must wrap a sharper angle between the bottom and the sides, compared to a more round-bottomed boat.
* Keel: an external keel makes a canoe track (hold its course) better and can stiffen a floppy bottom, but it can get stuck on rocks and decrease stability in rapids.
* Profile, the shape of the canoe&#x27;s sides. Sides that flare out above the waterline deflect water but require the paddler to reach out over the side of the canoe more. Sides that do the reverse, so that the gunwale width is less than the maximum width, the canoe is said to have tumblehome. Tumblehome improves final stability.
* Rocker: viewed from the side of the canoe, rocker is the amount of curve in the hull in relation to the water, much like the curve of a banana. The full length of the hull is in the water, so it tracks well and has good speed. As rocker increases, so does the ease of turning but at the cost of tracking. Some Native American birch-bark canoes were characterized by extreme rocker. 
* Hull symmetry: viewed from above, a symmetrical hull has its widest point at the center of the hull and both ends are identical. An asymmetrical hull typically has the widest section aft of centerline, creating a longer bow and improving speed.

==Modern materials and construction==

=== Plastic ===
Folding canoes usually consist of a PVC skin around an aluminum frame.
Inflatable canoes contain no rigid frame members and can be deflated, inflated, folded, and stored in bags and boxes. The more durable types consist of an abrasion-resistant nylon or rubber outer shell with separate PVC air chambers for the two side tubes and the floor.

Royalex — a composite material comprising an outer layer of vinyl and hard acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic (ABS) and an inner layer of ABS foam bonded by heat treatment — was another plastic alternative for canoes until 2014, when the raw composite material was discontinued by its only manufacturer. As a canoe material, Royalex is lighter, more resistant to UV damage, and more rigid, and has greater structural memory than non-composite plastics such as polyethylene. Canoes made of Royalex were, however, more expensive than canoes made from aluminum or from traditionally molded or roto-molded polyethylene hulls. Royalex is heavier and less suited for high-performance paddling than fiber-reinforced composites such as fiberglass, kevlar, or graphite.

=== Fiber reinforced composites ===
Modern canoes are generally constructed by layering a fiber material inside a &quot;female&quot; mold. Fiberglass is the most common material used in manufacturing canoes. Fiberglass is not expensive, can be molded to any shape, and is easy to repair. Kevlar is popular with paddlers looking for a light, durable boat that will not be taken in whitewater. Fiberglass and Kevlar are strong but lack rigidity. Carbon fiber is used in racing canoes to create a very light, rigid construction usually combined with Kevlar for durability. Boats are built by draping the cloth in a mold, then impregnating it with a liquid resin. Optionally, a vacuum process can be used to remove excess resin to reduce weight.

A gel coat on the outside gives a smoother appearance.

With stitch and glue, plywood panels are stitched together to form a hull shape, and the seams are reinforced with fiber reinforced composites and varnished.

A cedar strip canoe is essentially a composite canoe with a cedar core. Usually fiberglass is used to reinforce the canoe since it is clear and allows a view of the cedar.

=== Aluminum ===
Before the invention of fiberglass, aluminum was the standard choice for whitewater canoeing due to its value and strength by weight. This material was once more popular but is being replaced by modern lighter materials. &quot;It is tough, durable, and will take being dragged over the bottom very well&quot;, as it has no gel or polymer outer coating which would make it subject to abrasion. The hull does not degrade from long term exposure to sunlight, and &quot;extremes of hot and cold do not affect the material&quot;. It can dent, is difficult to repair, is noisy, can get stuck on underwater objects, and requires buoyancy chambers to assist in keeping the canoe afloat in a capsize.

==Canoes in culture==

In Canada, the canoe has been a theme in history and folklore, and is a symbol of Canadian identity. From 1935 to 1986 the Voyageur dollar depicted a canoe containing a voyageur (French-Canadian fur trader), and an Indigenous man, on the reverse.

The Chasse-galerie is a French-Canadian tale of voyageurs who, after a night of heavy drinking on New Year&#x27;s Eve at a remote timber camp want to visit their sweethearts some 100 leagues (about 400 km) away. Since they have to be back in time for work the next morning they make a pact with the devil. Their canoe will fly through the air, on condition that they not mention God&#x27;s name or touch the cross of any church steeple as they fly by in the canoe. One version of this fable ends with the coup de grâce when, still high in the sky, the voyageurs complete the hazardous journey but the canoe overturns, so the devil can honour the pact to deliver the voyageurs and still claim their souls.

In John Steinbeck&#x27;s novella &quot;The Pearl,&quot; set in Mexico, the main character&#x27;s canoe is a means of making a living that has been passed down for generations and represents a link to cultural tradition.

The Māori, indigenous Polynesian people, arrived in New Zealand in several waves of canoe (called waka) voyages. Canoe traditions are important to the identity of Māori. Whakapapa (genealogical links) back to the crew of founding canoes served to establish the origins of tribes, and defined tribal boundaries and relationships.

==Types of canoes==
Modern canoe types are usually categorized by the intended use. Many modern canoe designs are hybrids (a combination of two or more designs, meant for multiple uses). The purpose of the canoe will also often determine the materials used. Most canoes are designed for either one person (solo) or two people (tandem), but some are designed for more than two people.

===Sprint===
Sprint canoe is also known as flatwater racing. The paddler kneels on one knee and uses a single-blade paddle. Since canoes have no rudder, they must be steered by the athlete&#x27;s paddle using a J-stroke. Canoes may be entirely open or be partly covered. The minimum length of the opening on a C1 is . Boats are long and streamlined with a narrow beam, which makes them very unstable. A C4 can be up to long and weigh . International Canoe Federation (ICF) classifications include C1 (solo), C2 (crew of two), and C4 (crew of four). Race distances at the 2012 Olympic Games were 200 and 1000 meters.

===Slalom and wildwater===

In ICF whitewater slalom, paddlers negotiate their way down of whitewater rapids through a series of up to 25 gates (pairs of hanging poles). The colour of the poles indicates the direction in which the paddlers must pass through; time penalties are assessed for striking poles or missing gates. Categories are C1 (solo) and C2 (tandem), the latter for two men, and C2M (mixed) for one woman and one man. C1 boats must have a minimum weight and width of and and be not more than long. C2s must have a minimum weight and width of and , and be not more than . Rudders are prohibited. Canoes are decked and propelled by single-bladed paddles, and the competitor must kneel.

In ICF wildwater canoeing, athletes paddle a course of class III to IV whitewater (using the International Scale of River Difficulty), passing over waves, holes and rocks of a natural riverbed in events lasting either 20–30 minutes (&quot;Classic&quot; races) or 2–3 minutes (&quot;Sprint&quot; races). Categories are C1 and C2 for both women and men. C1s must have a minimum weight and width of and , and a maximum length of . C2s must have a minimum weight and width of and , and a maximum length of . Rudders are prohibited. The canoes are decked boats which must be propelled by single bladed paddles, with the paddler kneeling inside.

===Marathon===

Marathons are long-distance races which may include portages. Under ICF rules, minimum canoe weight is for C1 and C2, respectively. Other rules can vary by race. For example, athletes in the Classique Internationale de Canots de la Mauricie race in C2s, with a maximum length of , minimum width of at from the bottom of the centre of the craft, minimum height of at the bow and at the centre and stern. The Texas Water Safari, at , includes an open class, the only rule being the vessel must be human-powered. Although novel setups have been tried, the fastest so far has been the six-man canoe.

===Touring===

A &quot;touring&quot; or &quot;tripping&quot; canoe is a boat for traveling on lakes and rivers with capacity for camping gear. Tripping canoes, such as the Chestnut Prospector and Old Town Tripper derivates, are touring canoes for wilderness trips. They are typically made of heavier and tougher materials and designed with the ability to carry large amounts of gear while being maneuverable enough for rivers with some whitewater. Prospector is now a generic name for derivates of the Chestnut model, a popular type of wilderness tripping canoe. The Prospector is marked by a shallow arch hull with a relatively large amount of rocker, giving optimal balance for wilderness tripping over lakes and rivers with some rapids.

A touring canoe is sometimes covered with a greatly extended deck, forming a &quot;cockpit&quot; for the paddlers. A cockpit has the advantage that the gunwales can be made lower and narrower so the paddler can reach the water more easily.

===Freestyle===

A freestyle canoe is specialized for whitewater play and tricks. Most are identical to short, flat-bottomed kayak playboats except for their internal outfitting. The paddler kneels and uses a single-blade canoe paddle. Playboating is a discipline of whitewater canoeing where the paddler performs various technical moves in one place (a playspot), as opposed to downriver where the objective is to travel the length of a section of river (although whitewater canoeists will often stop and play en route). Specialized canoes known as playboats can be used.

===Square-stern canoe===
A square-stern canoe is an asymmetrical canoe with a squared-off stern for the mounting of an outboard motor, and is meant for lake travel or fishing. Since mounting a rudder on the square stern is very easy, such canoes often are adapted for sailing.

==Canoe launches==
A canoe launch is a place for launching canoes, similar to a boat launch which is often for launching larger watercraft. Canoe launches are frequently on river banks or beaches. Canoe launches may be designated on maps of places such as parks or nature reserves.

<text>The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show that has been broadcast on NBC since 1954. The program has been hosted by six comedians: Steve Allen (1954–1957), Jack Paar (1957–1962), Johnny Carson (1962–1992), Jay Leno (1992–2009 and 2010–2014), Conan O&#x27;Brien (2009–2010), and Jimmy Fallon (2014–present). Besides the main hosts, a number of regular &quot;guest hosts&quot; have been used, notably Ernie Kovacs, who hosted two nights per week during 1956–1957, and a number of guests used by Carson, who curtailed his own hosting duties back to three nights per week by the 1980s. Among Carson&#x27;s regular guest hosts were Joey Bishop, McLean Stevenson, David Letterman, David Brenner, Joan Rivers, and Jay Leno, although the practice has been mostly abandoned since hosts currently prefer reruns to showcasing potential rivals.

&quot;The Tonight Show&quot; is the world&#x27;s longest-running talk show and the longest-running regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. The current incarnation is taped from Studio 6B at NBC Studios in Rockefeller Center in New York, the same studio used during the later Jack Paar era and the first 10 years of Carson. During its initial run under Steve Allen, it originated from the Hudson Theatre on Broadway. From 1973 to 2009, and from 2010 to 2014 the show was taped at one of three different studios at NBC&#x27;s Burbank, California Studios. During Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s brief tenure, the show was taped at an opulently reworked studio on Stage 1 of Universal Studios Hollywood. 

Over the course of almost 70 years, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; has undergone only minor title changes. It aired under the name &quot;Tonight&quot; for several of its early years, as well as &quot;Tonight Starring Jack Paar&quot; and &quot;The Jack Paar Show&quot; due to the runaway popularity of its host, eventually settling permanently on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; after Carson began his tenure in 1962, albeit with the host&#x27;s name always included in the title. Beginning with Carson&#x27;s debut episode, network programmers, advertisers, and the show&#x27;s announcers would refer to the show by including the name of the host: &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, and, currently, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. In 1957, the show briefly tried a more news-style format. It has otherwise adhered to the talk show format introduced by Allen and honed further by Paar.

Carson is the longest-serving host to date, although he is not the host with the most episodes. &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; aired for 30 seasons between October 1962 and May 1992. Leno has the record of having hosted the greatest number of total televised episodes. Leno&#x27;s record is due to the fact that, unlike Carson (who only produced new shows three days a week starting in the 1980s), Leno never used guest hosts on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; (except Katie Couric, once) and produced new shows five days a week; Leno himself was also Carson&#x27;s primary guest host for the last five years of Carson&#x27;s tenure, adding even more episodes to his credit. Leaving out Leno&#x27;s five years as permanent guest host, Leno hosted 119 more episodes as full-time host than Carson. During Carson&#x27;s first four years, the show ran for 105 minutes and then was reduced to ninety minutes in early 1967 when Carson stopped appearing for the first 15 minutes because most affiliates were carrying their local news during that time slot as they expanded to half an hour. During Carson&#x27;s 1980 contract negotiations, the show was shortened to sixty minutes beginning that September, where it has remained since. NBC also broadcast &quot;The Best of Carson&quot; which were repeats of some of Carson&#x27;s popular older albeit usually recent shows. Prior to the debut of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in October 1975, NBC aired &quot;The Best of Carson&quot; on Saturday nights at 11:30 pm.

Apart from the show&#x27;s brief run as a news show in 1957, its shortest-serving host was Conan O&#x27;Brien, who went on to continue hosting a late-night program following his controversial departure. O&#x27;Brien hosted 146 episodes over the course of fewer than eight months before Leno was brought back as host, where he served for almost four additional years. Current host Fallon debuted on February 17, 2014. Fallon had previously hosted &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, and before &quot;Late Night&quot; he was a popular member of the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, co-hosting the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment with Tina Fey as well as performing sketches.

==Hosting history==
From 1950 to 1951 NBC aired &quot;Broadway Open House&quot;, a nightly variety show hosted primarily by comic Jerry Lester. It was unsuccessful because hosting five nights a week burned through all of Lester&#x27;s material faster than he could create it, so he was given rotating hosting duties for a weekly prime time variety show in 1951. The network scaled back late-night programming to shorter weekly shows. A spin-off, &quot;Dagmar&#x27;s Canteen&quot;, aired the following season on Saturday nights; at some other point in the week, &quot;Mary Kay&#x27;s Nightcap&quot; (which mostly consisted of previews of the next day&#x27;s programming) also aired that season.

The format of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; can be traced to a nightly 40-minute local program in New York, hosted by Allen and originally titled &quot;The Knickerbocker Beer Show&quot; (after the sponsor). It was quickly retitled &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. This premiered in 1953 on WNBT-TV (now broadcasting as WNBC-TV), the local network affiliate station in New York City. Beginning in September 1954, it was renamed &quot;Tonight!&quot; and began its historic run on the full NBC network.
Notes for hosting history


===Steve Allen (1954–1957)===

The first &quot;Tonight&quot; announcer was Gene Rayburn. Allen&#x27;s version of the show originated talk show staples such as an opening monologue, celebrity interviews, audience participation, and comedy bits in which cameras were taken outside the studio, as well as music including guest performers, a house vocal group (duo Steve and Eydie, who would marry each other in 1957) and a house band under Lyle &quot;Skitch&quot; Henderson.

When the show became a success, Allen got a primetime Sunday comedy/variety show in June 1956, leading him to share &quot;Tonight&quot; hosting duties with Ernie Kovacs during the 1956–57 season. To give Allen time to work on his Sunday evening show, Kovacs hosted &quot;Tonight&quot; on Monday and Tuesday nights with his own announcer (Bill Wendell) and bandleader.

During the later Steve Allen years, regular audience member Lillian Miller (usually referred to as &quot;Miss Miller&quot;) became such an integral part that she was forced to join American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the television/radio performers union. She would continue to perform the same service for most of the major talk shows for decades, including those hosted by Paar, Carson, Merv Griffin (until 1986), and Mike Douglas, among others.

Allen and Kovacs departed &quot;Tonight&quot; in January 1957 after NBC ordered Allen to concentrate all his efforts on his Sunday-night variety program, hoping to combat the dominance of the Sunday night ratings first by CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; then by ABC&#x27;s &quot;Maverick&quot;. 

Unlike the first installment of Johnny Carson&#x27;s tenure, which is lost except for audio recordings, a kinescope recording of most of the first &quot;Tonight Show&quot; under Allen survives. In this recording, Allen states during his opening monologue that &quot;this show is going to go on forever&quot;; although in context (and as part of a series of jokes) Allen refers to the fact the program is scheduled to run late into the night, his statement has come to refer to the longevity of the franchise.

===&quot;Tonight! America After Dark&quot; (1957)===
Rather than continuing with the same format after Allen and Kovacs&#x27;s departure from &quot;Tonight&quot;, NBC changed the show&#x27;s format to a news and features show, similar to that of the network&#x27;s popular morning program &quot;Today&quot;. The new show, renamed &quot;Tonight! America After Dark&quot;, was hosted first by Jack Lescoulie (also an announcer and long-time cast member on the &quot;Today&quot; morning program, 1952–1967) and then by Al (&quot;Jazzbo&quot;) Collins, with interviews conducted by Hy Gardner, and music provided by the Lou Stein Trio (later replaced by the Mort Lindsey Quartet, then the Johnny Guarnieri Quartet). This new version of the show was unpopular, resulting in a significant number of NBC affiliates dropping the show.

===Jack Paar (1957–1962)===

In July 1957, NBC returned the program to a talk/variety show format once again, with Jack Paar (who left his role as morning show host on CBS to join NBC) becoming the new solo host of the show. Under Paar, most of the NBC affiliates that had dropped the show during the ill-fated run of &quot;Tonight! America After Dark&quot; began airing the show once again. Paar&#x27;s era began the practice of branding the series after the host, and as such the program, though officially still called &quot;Tonight&quot;, was also marketed as &quot;The Jack Paar Show&quot;. A combo band conducted by Paar&#x27;s Army buddy pianist Jose Melis filled commercial breaks and backed musical entertainers. Paar also introduced the idea of having guest hosts; one of these early hosts was Johnny Carson. It was also one of the first regularly scheduled network shows to be telecast in color beginning sporadically in September 1957, with regular color broadcasts beginning in September 1960.

On February 11, 1960, Jack Paar unexpectedly walked off the show in the midst of the program – an absence that lasted almost a month – after NBC censors edited out a segment taped the night before about a joke involving a &quot;WC&quot; (&quot;water closet&quot;, a polite term for a flush toilet) being confused for a &quot;wayside chapel&quot;. As he left his desk, he said, &quot;I am leaving &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. There must be a better way of making a living than this&quot;. Paar&#x27;s abrupt departure left his startled announcer, Hugh Downs, to finish the late-night broadcast himself.

Paar returned to the show on March 7, 1960, strolled on stage after the opening credits, struck a pose, and said, &quot;As I was saying before I was interrupted . . .&quot; After the audience erupted in applause, Paar continued: &quot;when I walked off, I said there must be a better way of making a living. Well, I&#x27;ve looked—and there isn&#x27;t!&quot; However, citing that he would prefer to do one prime-time show per week rather than five late-night installments, Paar eventually left the show two years later in March 1962, at the pinnacle of his success as host. The guests on the last show were Jack E. Leonard, Alexander King, Robert Merrill and Buddy Hackett. Among those appearing in taped farewell messages were Richard Nixon, Robert F. Kennedy, Billy Graham, Bob Hope and Jack Benny. Downs was the announcer, and Melis led the band. &quot;The Jack Paar Show&quot; was moved to the evening&#x27;s prime time (as &quot;The Jack Paar Program&quot;) and aired weekly on Friday nights through the 1965 season.

===Transition from Paar to Carson (1962)===

Johnny Carson was chosen as Paar&#x27;s successor when Paar chose to leave &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; for a prime time show. Carson was host at the time of the weekday afternoon quiz show &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; on the newest and then lowest-rated radio and television network, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC, as the Blue Network, had been separated from NBC in 1943 owing to government pressure). Because Carson was under contract through September to ABC and producer Don Fedderson (who held him to his contract until the day it expired), he could not take over as host until October 1, 1962. The months between Paar and Carson were filled by a series of guest hosts including Art Linkletter (4 weeks), Joey Bishop (2 weeks), Bob Cummings, Merv Griffin (4 weeks), Jack Carter, Jan Murray, Peter Lind Hayes and Mary Healy, Soupy Sales, Mort Sahl, Steve Lawrence, Jerry Lewis (2 weeks), Jimmy Dean, Arlene Francis, Jack E. Leonard, Hugh Downs, Groucho Marx, Hal March and Donald O&#x27;Connor, many of whom later noted they were being led to believe they were auditioning for the job; Francis was among the first women to ever host a late-night talk show. Griffin was so well received as a guest host that NBC gave him his own daytime talk show, the first of three he would host in his broadcasting career, which debuted the same day Carson took over the late-night show, and Lewis&#x27;s two-week stint was so successful that NBC seriously considered retracting their offer to Carson. Lewis subsequently wound up hosting a lavish 2-hour prime time talk show for ABC entitled &quot;The Jerry Lewis Show&quot;, which was famously unsuccessful, and continued his more successful movie career. ABC also picked up Dean as a variety show host, airing &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot; for three years from 1963 to 1966.

The show was broadcast under the title &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; during this interregnum, with Skitch Henderson returning as bandleader. Hugh Downs remained as announcer/sidekick until taking over hosting duties on &quot;Today&quot; in September, at which point he was replaced by Ed Herlihy.

===Johnny Carson (1962–1992)===

Groucho Marx introduced Carson as the new host on October 1, 1962. Ed McMahon was Carson&#x27;s announcer and on-screen side-kick, the same role he&#x27;d filled on &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; McMahon also introduced Carson with the drawn out catchphrase &quot;Heeeeeeeeeeeeeere&#x27;s Johnny!&quot; &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; orchestra was, for Carson&#x27;s first four years, still led by Skitch Henderson. After a brief stint by Milton DeLugg, beginning in 1967 the &quot;NBC Orchestra&quot; was then headed by trumpeter Doc Severinsen who had played in the band during the Henderson era. [See &quot;Music and Announcers&quot; below.] For all but a few months of its first decade on the air, Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; was based in New York City. In 1972, the show moved to Burbank, California into Studio One of NBC Studios West Coast (although it was announced as coming from nearby Hollywood) for the remainder of his tenure.

Carson lacked the mercurial, electric personality of Paar, and his version of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; never riveted the country&#x27;s attention the way that Paar&#x27;s had, but his more predictable approach eventually became part of the cultural landscape by virtue of the fact that the viewership, in a basically three-network paradigm, was infinitely more monolithic than it later became. Examples include when he played the game &quot;Twister&quot; with Eva Gabor in 1966, which increased the sales of the relatively unknown game. In December 1973, when Carson joked about an alleged shortage of toilet paper, panic buying and hoarding ensued across the United States as consumers emptied stores, causing a real shortage that lasted for weeks. Stores and toilet paper manufacturers had to ration supplies until the panic ended.

Carson&#x27;s ratings usually substantially led his timeslot, in spite of the fact that he intermittently faced many other late-night competitors including Les Crane, Bill Dana, David Frost, Regis Philbin, Alan Thicke, Jerry Lewis, Joan Rivers, David Brenner, Pat Sajak, Ron Reagan, Dennis Miller, and most notably Steve Allen, Arsenio Hall, Joey Bishop, Merv Griffin, and Dick Cavett (Carson saw his friend Cavett as his real competition but Cavett was on ABC, a much smaller network at the time).

As primetime variety shows such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; faded in prominence over the course of the 1970s, Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; emerged as a showcase for all kinds of talent, as well as continuing the tradition of a vaudeville-style variety show. Carson&#x27;s show continued Paar&#x27;s tradition of launching the careers of a number of comedians, in Carson&#x27;s case including Jerry Seinfeld, David Letterman, Joan Rivers, Jeff Foxworthy, Ellen DeGeneres, Freddie Prinze, David Brenner, Tim Allen, Drew Carey, and Roseanne Barr.

Carson also frequently used guest hosts, especially after 1981 when he negotiated a contract that gave him numerous weeks off every year, as well as Mondays. Frequent guest hosts (over 50 episodes each) included Joey Bishop (177 times, mostly in the 1960s), Joan Rivers (93, during the 1970s and 1980s), John Davidson (87), Bob Newhart (87), David Brenner (70), McLean Stevenson (58), Jerry Lewis (52, mostly in the 1960s), David Letterman (51, mostly between 1980 and 1981), and Jay Leno. By the late 1980s, Leno was designated the permanent and only guest host, and consequently hosted several dozen episodes each year, totalling 333 &quot;guest host&quot; appearances during Carson&#x27;s tenure.

===Jay Leno (1992–2009)===

On May 22, 1992, Johnny Carson retired after three decades behind the iconic late-night desk, and was replaced by Jay Leno amid national and media controversy. David Letterman not only wanted to move into that earlier time slot from his &quot;Late Night&quot; spot (which had been broadcast following Carson&#x27;s program) after &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and was considered personally by Carson (whose opinion was not revealed until several years later) as his natural successor despite Leno having been Carson&#x27;s permanent guest host for several years. Letterman, having had his heart set on the earlier time slot in spite of Leno&#x27;s ratings success as recurring substitute host, left NBC (on Carson&#x27;s advice) and joined rival network CBS. Their new program and entry into the late-night television universe, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, airing in the same slot, competed head to head against &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Leno in the host&#x27;s chair and behind that iconic desk, for the better part of two decades, although Leno consistently enjoyed higher ratings after the first two years.

On September 27, 2004, the 50th anniversary of the show&#x27;s premiere, NBC announced that Leno would be succeeded by Conan O&#x27;Brien in 2009. The network shocked Leno, who had been consistently number one in the time period, when he was told that he would be fired in five years, with O&#x27;Brien taking over the slot at that time. Leno told his audience about this unique network decision at the beginning of his next show, mentioning that he had accepted it, noting that he wanted to avoid repeating the hard feelings that had somehow developed with Letterman, and called O&#x27;Brien &quot;certainly the most deserving person for the job&quot; in the wake of his (Leno&#x27;s) eventual departure. Five years later, what was to have been the final episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Leno as host aired on Friday, May 29, 2009.

Not wanting Leno, who remained number one in the ratings, to move to a competing network, NBC signed the host to a new contract to host a new prime-time talk show beginning in September 2009, entitled &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, with a format similar to his &quot;Tonight Show&quot; except that he was contractually prohibited from using a desk on the show. In a departure from network programming conventions of the time, the new show aired every weeknight at 10 p.m. Eastern/Pacific, competing with expensively produced narrative series on other networks and leading into affiliates&#x27; local news broadcasts and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;.

===Conan O&#x27;Brien (2009–2010)===

Conan O&#x27;Brien replaced Leno as host on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on Monday, June 1 from a lavish newly constructed studio inside Stage 1 of the Universal Studios Hollywood backlot, temporarily ending an era (since 1972) of recording the show in Burbank.

====2010 timeslot conflict and Leno&#x27;s return====

After a strong debut week, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s total audience fell precipitously over the summer months, and the program began losing to &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in overall ratings. In contrast, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s performance in the crucial 18–49 demographic was favorable, and it was found that he had brought down the median age of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; audience by a decade compared with his predecessor, indicating that a generational shift was taking effect as O&#x27;Brien established himself in an earlier timeslot. Taking this into account, columnist Tom Shales assessed in August 2009 that O&#x27;Brien was in a better position than Leno had been when he began his &quot;Tonight Show&quot; run in 1992; Leno consistently lost to Letterman in the ratings for eighteen months before eventually cementing his number one status.

&quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; debuted in September 2009, three months into O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; tenure, performing to significantly lower ratings than the primetime dramas it had replaced on NBC and trailing the competition. NBC had expected the drop, having calculated that lower ratings would be balanced by a talk show&#x27;s correspondingly lower expense compared to more popular scripted programming. In the 11:35 period, &quot;The Late Show&quot; would largely maintain its lead over &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in total viewers in early Fall, during which Letterman was receiving tabloid attention due to a blackmail scandal. In addition, &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; was in the unusual situation of being a talk show following a talk show hosted by its predecessor on the same network, and the booking war that resulted often left &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; getting second dibs on guests. One publicist reported that the aggression was such that &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; had signaled to potential guests that doing O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s program before Leno&#x27;s would be punished with secondary placement in the line-up.

Though NBC claimed that the performance of &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; offered no surprises and that O&#x27;Brien was meeting expectations as well, the network had failed to anticipate the impact that Leno&#x27;s weaker 10pm lead-in would have on the local 11pm news, which suffered a drastic drop in ratings (between 25%–50% nationwide) as a demonstrable result. As the affiliates rely on the revenue generated during the news, this generated a furor from the local stations and placed pressure on NBC to quickly fix the 10pm situation, which was contributing to a cascading effect on the ratings of &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O’Brien&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, although the ratings of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; had already nosedived months before Leno&#x27;s prime time show went on the air.

On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Leno would move from his 10 p.m. weeknight time slot back to the traditional &quot;Tonight Show&quot; slot at 11:35. Under this proposal, Leno&#x27;s show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes, which would make the monologue, Leno&#x27;s most popular segment, the essence of the program. This would move &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; to 12:05 a.m., a post-midnight start for the first time in its sixty-year history, while &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; would be pushed to 1:05am, and &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; would likely be cancelled. Under NBC&#x27;s (later contested) interpretation of O’Brien&#x27;s contract, the host was only guaranteed &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in name rather than the 11:35pm slot with which it was synonymous.

On January 10, NBC confirmed it would be moving Leno out of primetime as of February 12 and intended to move him back to late-night as soon as possible. TMZ reported that O&#x27;Brien was given no advance notice of this change, and that NBC offered him a choice: &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in a 12:05 a.m. time slot, or the option to leave the network. On January 12, O&#x27;Brien issued a press release that stated he would not continue with &quot;Tonight&quot; if it was moved to a 12:05 a.m. time slot, saying, &quot;I believe that delaying &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; at 12:05 simply isn&#x27;t &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot;&quot; 

When Oprah Winfrey later quoted this statement to Leno during an episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in the aftermath of the fallout, he responded: &quot;Well, if you look at where [Conan&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;] ratings were, it was already destructive to the franchise&quot;.
Leno was criticized for his remark, which contradicted his statement that &quot;I think Conan is doing fine&quot; mere months earlier, after which O’Brien&#x27;s ratings were on an upward trend. Some observers considered the portrayal of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s ouster as being specifically about the host&#x27;s ratings to be spin, as it ignored O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s far less expensive contract (and thus far less expensive buyout), O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s improving ratings before the controversy, and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s younger demographics, all of which suggested profitability.

After the decision was made to reinstate Leno, NBC executives and Leno maintained in the media that O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s ratings were responsible for his removal from the traditional &quot;Tonight Show&quot; time slot, while O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s supporters argued that the incumbent host had been denied the unambiguous transition, network support and time to grow that his predecessor had received. In addition, it was pointed out that Leno&#x27;s 10pm program, rather than O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s performance, had forced the need for line-up changes, while Leno&#x27;s penalty clause all but guaranteed his continued presence on NBC late night after the cancellation of his primetime show. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s rating surge during the controversy was also seen by some of his proponents as having the potential to be the host&#x27;s &quot;Hugh Grant moment&quot; – an allusion to a 1995 interview on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; that aired shortly after the British actor had been caught publicly soliciting a prostitute. Leno&#x27;s interview with Grant was widely watched due to the scandal, and Leno&#x27;s fortunes in his rivalry with Letterman permanently turned around in its wake.

The &quot;New York Post&quot; advanced a theory that O&#x27;Brien being the cheaper host to lose was the cardinal factor in NBC&#x27;s decision to negotiate his departure. The &quot;Post&quot; claimed that Leno had an &quot;ironclad&quot; guarantee for $150 million if he had been taken off the air, far higher than what it would cost for O&#x27;Brien to depart the network. Skip Brittenham, an entertainment attorney and partner at the law firm that had negotiated Leno&#x27;s contract, was later asked about this claim in an interview. Though Brittenham refused to comment on the veracity of the publicly reported penalty figure, he allowed that &quot;I think the facts speak for themselves.&quot;

On January 21, it was announced that NBC had struck a deal with O&#x27;Brien in which he would leave &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and receive a $33 million payout – effectively a buyout of his three-year contract, which was reputed to be approximately $12 million a year. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s staff of almost 200 would receive $12 million divided in their departure, making the total of the settlement $45 million. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s final episode aired on Friday, January 22, ending his relationship with NBC after 22 years. Leno resumed hosting &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on March 1, 2010, after NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics concluded.

O&#x27;Brien returned to late-night television on November 8, 2010 (after his non-compete agreement expired), hosting the self-owned &quot;Conan&quot; on cable channel TBS. Conan remained partnered with TBS until 2021, although his show was truncated from an hour to thirty minutes in length in 2019 due to ratings issues. Conan&#x27;s final episode on TBS aired on June 24, 2021.

===Leno&#x27;s second tenure (2010–2014)===
On March 1, 2010, Jay Leno returned to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, with Wally Wingert as his announcer. On April 12, 2010, bandleader Kevin Eubanks announced his departure after 18 years (15 years as bandleader) on May 28. Rickey Minor replaced him as bandleader on June 7. On July 1, 2010, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that only six months into its second life, Leno&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; posted its lowest ratings since 1992. By September 2010, Leno&#x27;s ratings had fallen below O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s when he had hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, although O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s ratings had spiked during the show&#x27;s final days during the media publicity onslaught, and this tally pivots upon that anomalous spike in O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s ratings. NBC ratings specialist Tom Bierbaum commented that due to the host being out of late-night television for a period of time and the subsequent 2010 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; conflict, Leno&#x27;s ratings fall was &quot;not a surprise at all.&quot; In October 2010, David Letterman beat Leno&#x27;s program in the ratings, for the first time since Leno returned to hosting &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot; By May 2011, Leno regained the lead over Letterman and held it until leaving the show in February 2014. In August 2012, The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; was in trouble for a number of reasons, notably that NBC was losing money. The &quot;Times&quot; later elaborated, noting that advertising revenue from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; had dropped more than 40% since 2007, from $255.9 million annually to $146.1 million. Still, despite these problems, during 2012–13, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; was consistently the highest-ranking late-night show, regularly achieving audiences of over 3.5 million, according to Nielsen ratings. Leno&#x27;s audience became considerably smaller after its peak 2002–03 season, when it routinely attracted 5.8 million viewers a night. This was partly due to the continuing fragmentation of the TV audience, with an increasing number of cable shows, such as &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; and Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s new show on TBS, in addition to competition with Letterman on CBS and since January 8, 2013, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on ABC, although Leno continued to lead the time slot. 

On April 3, 2013, after a dispute with the network over Leno&#x27;s joking about the network&#x27;s poor prime time performance in his monologues, NBC announced that Leno would retire in 2014, with &quot;Late Night&quot; host Jimmy Fallon taking over &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; after the conclusion of NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics. It was Leno&#x27;s suggestion to use NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Olympics as a springboard for Fallon&#x27;s tenure. The date was later moved up a week to February 17, midway through the Olympics.

Leno&#x27;s last &quot;Tonight Show&quot; aired on February 6, 2014, featuring guests Billy Crystal (Leno&#x27;s first guest in 1992) and Garth Brooks. Leno gave a tearful goodbye at the end of the program, calling himself &quot;the luckiest guy in the world&quot;, and reflecting on his time as host as &quot;the greatest 22 years of my life.&quot;

===Jimmy Fallon (2014–present)===
Jimmy Fallon (who had hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;″s follow-up show, &quot;Late Night&quot;, since 2009) assumed &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; hosting role on February 17, 2014, with his initial guests being Will Smith and the rock band U2, plus an assortment of celebrity cameos, including an appearance by one of Fallon&#x27;s direct broadcast competitors, Stephen Colbert (who would later replace David Letterman on the competing &quot;The Late Show&quot; in 2015), and another by former permanent guest host Joan Rivers, making her first appearance on &quot;Tonight&quot; since cutting ties with Carson in 1986. The show&#x27;s opening sequence was directed by filmmaker Spike Lee.

As part of the transition to Fallon, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; would be brought back to New York City after 42 years in Southern California. Approximately $5 million was budgeted to renovate Studio 6B, where Fallon recorded &quot;Late Night&quot;. The move also enabled NBC to take advantage of a newly enacted New York state tax credit for talk shows that are &quot;filmed before a studio audience of at least 200, as long as they carry a production budget of at least $30 million and have been shot outside New York for at least five seasons.&quot; Studio 6B is also where Jack Paar and Johnny Carson hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; before the show moved to Burbank in 1972. Lorne Michaels (producer of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in which Fallon appeared prior to hosting &quot;Late Night&quot;) became executive producer of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

Fallon&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; has gone on the road to produce episodes remotely in its first year, spending four days at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida in June 2014 to promote new attractions at NBCUniversal&#x27;s theme parks there. In February 2015, Fallon presented a special Sunday night show from Phoenix, Arizona airing after NBC&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl XLIX, followed by four days of shows in Stage 1 at Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles (where Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s version was produced).

Aside from the title change and a new set, Fallon&#x27;s version of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; is nearly identical to the format of &quot;Late Night&quot; he employed, as he imported many of his signature comedy bits and much of his &quot;Late Night&quot; staff, including house band The Roots and announcer Steve Higgins. Prior to the transition, Fallon said, &quot;In our heads, we&#x27;ve been doing &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; for five years. We&#x27;re just on at a later hour.&quot;

==Music and announcers==

Music during the show&#x27;s introduction and commercial segues is supplied by The Tonight Show Band. This ensemble was a jazz big band until the end of Johnny Carson&#x27;s tenure. Skitch Henderson was the bandleader during the Steve Allen and early Carson years, followed briefly by Milton DeLugg (who had previously led the band on &quot;Broadway Open House&quot; and later became the musical director of &quot;The Gong Show&quot;). Gene Rayburn served as Allen&#x27;s announcer and sidekick and also guest-hosted some episodes all the way through the early part of Carson&#x27;s run. The Lou Stein Trio originally provided musical accompaniment during the short run of &quot;Tonight! America After Dark&quot;, which ran for six months between the Steve Allen/Ernie Kovacs and Jack Paar eras of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and was later replaced by the Mort Lindsey Quartet, which in turn, was replaced by the Johnny Guarnieri Quartet. José Melis led the band for Jack Paar, and, after a short while of using comic actor Franklin Pangborn, Hugh Downs was Paar&#x27;s announcer. For most of Johnny Carson&#x27;s run on the show, the show&#x27;s band, then called &quot;The NBC Orchestra&quot; was led by Doc Severinsen, former trumpet soloist in Henderson&#x27;s band for Steve Allen.

When McMahon was away from the show, Severinsen was the substitute announcer and Tommy Newsom would lead the band. (Newsom also took over when Severinsen was absent from the show.) On the rare occasions that both McMahon &quot;and&quot; Severinsen were away, Newsom would take the announcer&#x27;s chair and the band would be led by assistant musical director Shelly Cohen.

Severinsen&#x27;s big band featured several accomplished sidemen in addition to saxophonist Newsom, including trumpeter Snooky Young, pianist Ross Tompkins, drummer Ed Shaughnessy, trumpeter John Audino, trumpeter Conte Candoli, saxophonist Pete Christlieb, and jazz trumpet legend Clark Terry. The band frequently appeared on camera in the &quot;Stump the Band&quot; segments, where an audience member would dare the band to play some obscure song title, and the band would comically improvise something appropriate. The routine was played for full comedy value and the band was not really expected to know the songs; on two occasions the band did answer correctly, much to the maestro&#x27;s surprise. Severinsen was heard to ask incredulously, &quot;You mean we &quot;actually&quot;...?&quot;

When Carson&#x27;s tenure ended in 1992, the orchestra was axed and replaced by a smaller ensemble. The first bandleader during Leno&#x27;s tenure was Branford Marsalis. In 1992, The Tonight Show Band also welcomed its first female member, Vicki Randle. In 1995, Kevin Eubanks replaced Marsalis, though the Marsalis-written theme was used throughout Leno&#x27;s first tenure. On March 29, 2004, John Melendez from &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; replaced Leno&#x27;s long-time announcer Edd Hall.

Conan O&#x27;Brien announced on the February 18, 2009, episode of &quot;Late Night&quot; that The Max Weinberg 7 (rechristened as The Tonight Show Band, and adding a second percussionist), the house band on that program, would be accompanying him to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; as his version&#x27;s house band. It was announced February 23, 2009, that former &quot;Late Night&quot; sidekick Andy Richter would be O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s announcer. Richter replaced O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s former long-time announcer Joel Godard (who stayed behind in New York) when his rendition of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; began.

For the second incarnation of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, a new bandleader was selected, though original bandleader Kevin Eubanks returned for a few weeks in the transition. He officially announced his departure after 18 years on April 12, 2010, with his final episode airing May 28. Rickey Minor was announced as his replacement, and took over on June 7. The show also inaugurated a new theme tune composed by Minor.

With the return of Leno&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; in March 2010, Melendez continued in the writing role, which he was assigned to on the prime-time &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, although the announcing duty went to Wally Wingert.

Jimmy Fallon began hosting &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on February 17, 2014; his house band on &quot;Late Night&quot;, The Roots, joined him, as did announcer Steve Higgins. Fallon has used guest hosts rarely, co-hosting the April 9th, 2018, broadcast with Cardi B, Kevin Hart co-hosting the September 19, 2018, broadcast, Dave Grohl co-hosting the May 24, 2021, broadcast, Jimmy Kimmel hosting the April 1, 2022, broadcast (with Fallon swapping duties to guest host &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;), Shawn Mendes co-hosting the April 29, 2022, broadcast, Megan Thee Stallion co-hosting the August 11, 2022, broadcast, Demi Lovato co-hosting the August 17, 2022, broadcast, Jack Harlow co-hosting the October 6, 2022, broadcast and Bad Bunny co-hosting the January 13, 2025, broadcast.

==Broadcasting milestones==

&quot;The Tonight Show&quot; began its broadcast at 11:15 p.m. ET, following an affiliate&#x27;s 15-minute news broadcast. As more affiliates lengthened their local news programs to 30 minutes, the show began doing two openings, one for the affiliates that began at 11:15 and another for those who joined at 11:30. By early 1965, only 43 of the 190 affiliated stations carried the entire show. After February 1965, Johnny Carson refused to appear until 11:30, and Ed McMahon &quot;hosted&quot; the 11:15 segment. Carson was not happy with this arrangement since McMahon&#x27;s monologue covered the same ground as Carson&#x27;s, and he finally insisted that the show&#x27;s start time be changed to 11:30. As a result, the two-opening practice was eliminated in December 1966.

When the show began it was broadcast live. On January 12, 1959, the show began to be videotaped for broadcast later on the same day, although initially the Thursday night programs were kept live. Color broadcasts began on September 19, 1960.

&quot;The Tonight Show&quot; became the first American television program to broadcast with MTS stereo sound in 1984, at first sporadically, by audio engineer Ron Estes. Regular use of MTS began in 1985. In September 1991, the show&#x27;s start time was shifted by five minutes to 11:35, in order to give network affiliates the opportunity to sell additional advertising during their late local newscasts. On April 26, 1999, the show started broadcasting in 1080i HDTV, becoming the first American nightly talk show to be shot in that format.

On March 19, 2009, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; became the first late-night talk show in history to have the sitting President of the United States as a guest, when President Barack Obama visited Jay Leno.

Throughout the years, the starting time and the length of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; has changed multiple times.

===First run episodes===

 Many NBC affiliates chose not to carry the first fifteen minutes of the show during this period, instead preferring to air a local newscast from 11 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. As of February 1965, Carson refused to host the first 15 minutes of the program, preferring to wait until the full network was in place before delivering his opening monologue; Ed McMahon hosted the program&#x27;s first 15 minutes instead. This persisted for nearly two years, until the show&#x27;s start time was finally adjusted to 11:30 p.m. in January 1967.

===Weekend repeats===
From 1965 to 1975, until the premiere of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, weekend repeats of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; were staples of the NBC schedule. These repeats ran in the following time slots:

==Gags, sketches, and segments==
Allen
* Answer Man: Allen would come up with the answer to an unknown question, then read the question, which would invariably be the punchline to a joke.
* Man on the street interviews: often featured actors Don Knotts, Louis Nye and Tom Poston, though Allen also performed impromptu bits with non-professional civilians.
* ... and Costello: Lou Costello would re-enact his classic Abbott and Costello comedy bits with Poston or Nye in the place of the then-briefly-retired Bud Abbott.
* Crazy Shots: Later known as &quot;Wild Pictures&quot;. Allen&#x27;s supporting cast and guest stars would participate in quick visual gags while Allen played piano accompaniment.
* Steve and Eydie: A vocal duo consisting of up-and-coming singers Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gormé, who performed interludes (in a relic of the old-time radio era when entertainment programs included vocal groups in addition to house bands). The two would marry near the end of Allen&#x27;s run and remained together until Gormé died in 2013.

Kovacs
* Eugene: A befuddled and bumbling character largely performed in pantomime. The week of Kovacs&#x27;s last episodes of &quot;Tonight&quot;, Eugene received a prime-time special, &quot;Silent Show&quot;.

Paar
* Candid Camera: The off-again, on-again show, hosted by Allen Funt since radio&#x27;s heyday, was a segment on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1958.
* Stump the Band: Audience members are asked to name an obscure song and the band tries to play it. If the band does not know the song, it usually breaks into a comical piece of music. This segment went on to become part of Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;.
* Telephone Game: Another improvisational music bit, this one had Melis building songs around four-digit numbers (ostensibly the last four digits of an audience member&#x27;s phone number).

Carson
* Carnac the Magnificent: Carson plays a psychic who is given sealed envelopes (that McMahon invariably states, with a flourish, have been kept &quot;hermetically sealed inside a mayonnaise jar underneath Funk &amp; Wagnalls&#x27; porch since noon today&quot;). Carnac holds an envelope to his head and recites the punchline to a joke contained within the envelope, he then rips open the envelope and reads the matching question inside. Sample: &quot;Saucepan... Who was Peter Pan&#x27;s wino brother?&quot; If a joke falls flat with the audience, Carnac invariably passes a comedic curse upon them (e.g., &quot;May a bloated yak change the temperature of your jacuzzi!&quot;). Carnac appears to be modeled after one of Allen&#x27;s earlier gags, &quot;The Question Man,&quot; in which Allen is given an answer to which he then provides the punchline in the form of a question.
* The Tea Time Movie:, with &quot;Art Fern&quot; and the Matinée Lady (originally Paula Prentiss, then a parade of one shots including Edy Williams, Juliet Prowse and Lee Meredith, then for many years Carol Wayne, then Danuta Wesley, and finally Teresa Ganzel). Carson once said that Art Fern was his favorite character: &quot;He&#x27;s so sleazy!&quot; Huckster Art usually wore a loud suit, lavish toupee, and pencil mustache, and spoke in the high, nasal approximation of Jackie Gleason&#x27;s &quot;Reginald van Gleason III&quot; character. A parody of 1950s-style, fast-talking advertising pitchmen, the Tea Time Movie consists of a rapid-fire series of fake advertisements for products and companies supposedly sponsoring a mid-afternoon movie. Invariably the jokes refer to his buxom Matinée Lady assistant, and at least once in every skit a variation of the &quot;Slauson Cutoff&quot; joke is made (e.g., &quot;You can find our store by heading down Hwy. 101 until you get to the Slauson Cutoff. Get out of the car, cut off your slauson, get back in the car.&quot;), as is a reference to &quot;Drive until you get to... (a map is unfolded to reveal a table fork) the &quot;fork&quot; in the &quot;road&quot;!&quot; Art would then return us to today&#x27;s movie (like &quot;Tarzan and Cheetah Have to Get Married&quot; or &quot;Rin Tin Tin Gets Fixed Fixed Fixed,&quot; etc.), followed by an antique, four-second film clip. Back to Art, caught necking with the Matinée Lady before announcing another movie and another commercial.

Leno
* Headlines (Monday): Humorous print items sent in by viewers. These real-life headlines and advertisements usually contain typographical errors, double entendres, mismatched juxtapositions and/or unintentionally inappropriate items (wedding announcements with peculiar name combinations were a recurring theme). The segment usually starts out with a fake, humorous Headline during the introduction for the segment, such as Arabs Wish Bush &quot;A Happy Shoe Year!&quot;, usually reflecting some current event.
* Jaywalking: A prerecorded segment, &quot;Jaywalking&quot; is a play on the host&#x27;s name and the illegal practice of jaywalking. Leno asks people questions about current news and other topics in public areas around Los Angeles (usually Hollywood Boulevard, Melrose Avenue or Universal Studios). Most responses are outrageously incorrect; for example, one person believed that Abraham Lincoln was the first president, and another could not identify a picture of Hillary Clinton. Sometimes the questions are of the &quot;What color is the White House?&quot; level, such as asking in what country the Panama Canal is located. Up to 15 people are interviewed in an hour or less for each segment, with about nine interviews used on the air.
* Stuff We Found on eBay: Outrageous, real-life items available on the auction Web site eBay are shown, with the audience asked to guess whether or not the item was sold.
* Unusual Mother&#x27;s Day, Father&#x27;s Day, Christmas gifts: Gift items appropriate for holidays are shown; some real, some phony, all unusual

O&#x27;Brien

* Twitter Tracker: In this sketch, Conan is interrupted by an overzealous announcer (voiced by show writer Brian McCann) while lamenting the increasing number of celebrities who are using Twitter. The announcer attempts to prove to Conan that celebrity tweets are exciting by reading some of his favorites, which all describe mundane activities. The sketch is accompanied by increasingly elaborate animations in which the bird from the Twitter logo is repeatedly killed. The announcer tries to persuade Conan to play a game by using a rhyming sentence in which he refers to him as CoCo.
* Wax Fonzie/Wax Tom Cruise: While visiting a warehouse full of poor quality celebrity wax figures, Conan identified two as his favorite and purchased them. One was of Henry Winkler as his &quot;Happy Days&quot; character Arthur Fonzarelli (whose hand positioning caused Conan to comment that he had just finished up at the urinal), and the other was a creepy-looking figure of Tom Cruise. Both wax figures made appearances on the show, including skits being shot out of a cannon. Wax Tom Cruise for the most part survived, while Wax Fonzie&#x27;s face became irreplaceable. Wax Fonzie ultimately met its fate when it was obliterated in an explosion, part of a contest involving blowing up the contest winner&#x27;s old car.
* Ridiculously Expensive Sketches: As an act of mock revenge for NBC forcing him out of &quot;The Tonight Show&#x27;s&quot; traditional time slot, O&#x27;Brien spent the last few episodes debuting sketches that ostensibly would cost NBC an extremely large amount of money. The sketches used rare and expensive props (usually on loan) and contained media with unusually high licensing fees.

Fallon
Many of Fallon&#x27;s sketches moved over from &quot;Late Night&quot;.
* Pros &amp; Cons: Fallon weighs the positives and the negatives on a particular topic of current events, with the &quot;Pro&quot; setting up the punch line, in the form of the &quot;Con&quot;.
* Tonight Show Suggestion Box: Fallon responds to written suggestions, purportedly submitted by audience members, about ways to improve the show. As a result, the segment usually features three or four unrelated short comedy bits.
* Tonight Show Hashtags: Fallon puts out a call on Twitter each Wednesday for viewers to submit funny or absurd tweets based around a particular hashtag topic. Fallon then reads a few of the most comedic responses on Thursday&#x27;s show.
* Thank You Notes: Noting that Friday is when he usually takes care of &quot;personal stuff&quot; and that he ran out of time during the day, Fallon writes his weekly &quot;thank you notes&quot; on the air. Fallon thanks people in the news, current events, inanimate objects, and other random subjects to comedic effect. Each note is accompanied by reflective piano music from The Roots&#x27; James Poyser, and usually results in a comedic exchange between Fallon and Higgins.
*Tonight Show Superlatives: Usually done as a tie-in to that week&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; game, Fallon shows photos of athletes and gives them captions styled like those that might be used in a high school yearbook.
*Screen Grabs: Similar to Leno&#x27;s Headlines bit, viewers submit actual screen shots from various media (phones, internet, television, radio, etc.) that contain typos or similar errors with humorous results.
*Do Not Read List: Jimmy shares real published books found in actual libraries that have awkward titles &amp;/or subject matter, an ironic author&#x27;s name, or contain some other humorous element.
*Ew!: Jimmy portrays a teenage girl named Sara and invites many celebrities to be in Jimmy&#x27;s basement. Through the sketch, all &quot;girls&quot; say &quot;ew&quot; a lot. The most popular segment of this sketch is with Seth Rogen and Zac Efron.

In addition to its broadcast on CNBC Europe, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; airs on &quot;One&quot; in Germany, with German subtitles, weekdays at 11:00 p.m., one day after its American broadcast.

In India and Sri Lanka &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; airs on Comedy Central India on Weeknights at 11pm IST/SLST – within 24 hours of the U.S. Broadcast.

Also, in Sri Lanka CNBC Asia (CNBCLife) airs back-to-back editions of the show on weekends.

<text>PostGIS ( ) is an open source software program that adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL object-relational database. PostGIS follows the Simple Features for SQL specification from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

PostGIS is implemented as a &quot;PostgreSQL external extension&quot;.

==Features==

* Geometry types for Points, LineStrings, Polygons, MultiPoints, MultiLineStrings, MultiPolygons, GeometryCollections, 3D types TINS and polyhedral surfaces, including solids.
* Spheroidal types under the geography datatype Points, LineStrings, Polygons, MultiPoints, MultiLineStrings, MultiPolygons and GeometryCollections.
* raster type - supports various pixel types and more than 1000 bands per raster. Since PostGIS 3, is a separate PostgreSQL extension called postgis_raster.
* SQL/MM Topology support - via PostgreSQL extension postgis_topology.
* Spatial predicates for determining the interactions of geometries using the 3x3 DE-9IM (provided by the GEOS software library).
* Spatial operators for determining geospatial measurements like area, distance, length and perimeter.
* Spatial operators for determining geospatial set operations, like union, difference, symmetric difference and buffers (provided by GEOS).
* R-tree-over-GiST (Generalized Search Tree) spatial indexes for high speed spatial querying.
* Index selectivity support, to provide high performance query plans for mixed spatial/non-spatial queries.

The PostGIS implementation is based on &quot;light-weight&quot; geometries and indexes optimized to reduce disk and memory footprint. Using light-weight geometries helps servers increase the amount of data migrated up from physical disk storage into RAM, improving query performance substantially.

PostGIS is registered as &quot;implements the specified standard&quot; for &quot;Simple Features for SQL&quot; by the OGC. PostGIS has not been certified as compliant by the OGC.

== History ==

Refractions Research released the first version of PostGIS in 2001 under the GNU General Public License. After six release candidates, a stable &quot;1.0&quot; version followed on April 19, 2005.

In 2006 the OGC registered PostGIS as &quot;implement[ing] the specified standard&quot; for &quot;Simple Features for SQL&quot;.


==Users==

<text>Originally, the word computing was synonymous with counting and calculating, and the science and technology of mathematical calculations. Today, &quot;computing&quot; means using computers and other computing machines. It includes their operation and usage, the electrical processes carried out within the computing hardware itself, and the theoretical concepts governing them (computer science).

<text>Ernest Edward Kovacs (January 23, 1919 – January 13, 1962) was an American comedian, actor, and writer.

Kovacs&#x27;s visually experimental and often spontaneous comedic style influenced numerous television comedy programs for years after his death. Kovacs has been credited as an influence by many individuals and shows, including Johnny Carson, &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, Jim Henson, &quot;Max Headroom&quot;, Chevy Chase, Conan O&#x27;Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Dave Garroway, Andy Kaufman, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot;, &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, and Uncle Floyd, among others. Chase even thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy Award for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

While Kovacs and his wife Edie Adams received Emmy nominations for Best Performances in a Comedy Series during 1957, his talent was not recognized formally until after his death. The 1962 Emmy for Outstanding Electronic Camera Work and the Directors&#x27; Guild award came a short time after his fatal accident. A quarter century later, he was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame. Kovacs also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in television. In 1986, the Museum of Broadcasting (later to become the Museum of Television &amp; Radio and now the Paley Center for Media) presented an exhibit of Kovacs&#x27;s work, called &quot;The Vision of Ernie Kovacs&quot;. The Pulitzer Prize–winning television critic, William A. Henry III, wrote for the museum&#x27;s booklet: &quot;Kovacs was more than another wide-eyed, self-ingratiating clown. He was television&#x27;s first significant video artist.&quot;

==Early life and career==
Ernest Kovacs was born in 1919. His father, Andrew John Kovacs emigrated from Tornaújfalu, Hungary, which is now known as Turnianska Nová Ves, Slovakia. Andrew sailed on the S.S. &quot;Würzburg&quot; via Bremen, arriving at Ellis Island on February 8, 1906, at age 16. He worked as a policeman, restaurateur, and bootlegger, the last so successfully that he moved his wife Mary, son Tom, and Tom’s half-brother Ernest Edward Kovacs into a 20-room mansion in the better part of Trenton.

Though a poor student, Kovacs was influenced by his Trenton Central High School drama teacher, Harold Van Kirk, and received an acting scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1937 with Van Kirk&#x27;s help, appearing with Long Island, N.Y. stock companies. The end of Prohibition and the onset of the Great Depression resulted in difficult financial times for the family. When Kovacs began drama school, all he could afford was a fifth-floor walk-up apartment on West 74th Street in New York City.

During this time, he watched many &quot;Grade B&quot; movies; admission was only ten cents. Many of these movies influenced his comedy routines later.

A 1938 local newspaper photograph shows Kovacs as a member of the Prospect Players, not yet wearing his trademark mustache. Kovacs used his class vacation time to pursue roles in summer stock companies. While working in Vermont in 1939, he became so seriously ill with pneumonia and pleurisy that his doctors didn&#x27;t expect him to survive. During the next year and a half, his comedic talents developed as he entertained both doctors and patients with his antics during stays at several hospitals. While hospitalized, Kovacs developed a lifelong love of classical music by the gift of a radio, which he kept tuned to WQXR. By the time he was released his parents had separated, and Kovacs went back to Trenton, living with his mother in a two-room apartment over a store. He began work as a cigar salesman, which resulted in a lifelong tobacco-smoking habit.

Kovacs&#x27;s first paid entertainment work was during 1941 as an announcer for Trenton&#x27;s radio station WTTM.&lt;ref name=&quot;marlintaylor/kovacs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the next nine years with WTTM, becoming the station&#x27;s director of special events; in this job he did things like trying to see what it was like to be run over by a train (leaving the tracks at the last minute) and broadcasting from the cockpit of a plane for which he took flying lessons. Kovacs was also involved with local theater; a local newspaper published a photograph of him and the news that he was doing some directing for the Trenton Players Guild in early 1941. &quot;The Trentonian&quot;, a local daily newspaper, offered Kovacs a column in June 1945; he named it &quot;Kovacs Unlimited&quot; (1945–50).&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary/Kovacs,Ernie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Start in television==


In January 1950, arriving at NBC&#x27;s Philadelphia affiliate, WPTZ, for an audition, wearing a barrel and shorts, got Kovacs his first television job. His first show was &quot;Pick Your Ideal&quot;, a fashion and promotional program for the Ideal Manufacturing Company. Before long, Kovacs was also the host of &quot;Deadline For Dinner&quot; and &quot;Now You&#x27;re Cooking&quot;, shows featuring advice from local chefs. When Kovacs&#x27;s guest chef did not arrive in time for the show, he offered a recipe for &quot;Eggs Scavok&quot; (Kovacs spelled backward). Kovacs seasoned the egg dish with ashes from his cigar. The sponsor was a local propane company. Hosting these shows soon resulted in his becoming host of a program named &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot;, named for WPTZ&#x27;s channel 3 spot on television dials.

Premiering in November 1950, &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot; was innovative because it was the first regularly scheduled early morning (7–9am) show in a major television market, predating NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; by more than a year. Prior to this, it had been assumed that few people would watch television at such an early hour. While the show was advertised as early morning news and weather, Kovacs provided this and more in an original manner. When rain was in the weather forecast, Kovacs would get on a ladder and pour water down on the staff member reading the report. Goats were auditioned for a local theater performance and tiny women appeared to walk up his arm. Kovacs also went outside of the studio for some of his skits, running through a downtown Philadelphia restaurant in a gorilla suit in one; in another, he looked into a construction pit, saying it was deep enough to see to China, when a man in Chinese clothing popped up, said a few words in the language, and ran off. Despite its popularity, the weekly prop budget for the show was just $15. Kovacs once asked his viewers to send unwanted items to Channel 3; they filled the station&#x27;s lobby.

The only character no one ever saw inspired more gifts; he was Howard, the World&#x27;s Strongest Ant. From the time of his WPTZ debut, Howard received more than 30,000 miniaturized gifts from Kovacs&#x27;s viewers, including a tiny, mink-lined swimming pool. Kovacs began his Early Eyeball Fraternal &amp; Marching Society (EEFMS) while doing &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot;. There were membership cards with by-laws and ties; the password was a favorite phrase of Kovacs&#x27;s: &quot;It&#x27;s Been Real&quot;. Kovacs continued the EEFMS on his morning show when he moved to WCBS in New York in 1952. The success of &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot; proved that people did indeed watch early-morning television, and it was one of the factors that caused NBC to create &quot;The Today Show&quot;. WPTZ did not begin broadcasting &quot;Today&quot; when it premiered on January 14, 1952; network influence caused the station to end &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot; at the end of March of that year.

During early 1952, Kovacs was also doing a late morning show for WPTZ named &quot;Kovacs on the Corner&quot;. Kovacs would walk through an imaginary neighborhood, talking with various characters such as Pete the Cop and Luigi the Barber. As with &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot;, there were some special segments. &quot;Swap Time&quot; was one of them: Viewers could bring their unwanted items to the WPTZ studios to trade them live on the air with Kovacs. The show made its debut on January 4, 1952, with Kovacs losing creative control of the program soon after it was begun. &quot;Kovacs on the Corner&quot; was short-lived; it ended on March 28, 1952, along with &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot;. Kovacs then began work for WCBS-TV in New York with a local morning show and a later network one. Both programs were canceled; Kovacs lost the local morning program for the same reason as &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot;—the broadcasting time was confiscated by the station&#x27;s network in 1954.

==Visual humor and characters==

At WPTZ, Kovacs began using the ad-libbed and experimental style that would become his reputation, including video effects, superimpositions, reverse polarities and scanning, and quick blackouts. He was also noted for abstraction and carefully timed non-sequitur gags and for allowing the fourth wall to be breached. Kovacs&#x27;s cameras commonly showed his viewers activity beyond the boundaries of the show set—including crew members and outside the studio itself. Kovacs also liked talking to the off-camera crew and even introduced segments from the studio control room. He frequently made use of accidents and happenstance, incorporating the unexpected into his shows. In one of Kovacs&#x27;s Philadelphia broadcasts, Oscar Liebetrau, an elderly crew member who was known for often sleeping for the duration of the telecast, was introduced to the audience as &quot;Sleeping Schwartz.&quot; Kovacs was once knocked unconscious when a pie smashed into his face still had the plate under it.

Kovacs&#x27;s love of spontaneity extended to his crew, who would occasionally play on-air pranks on him to see how he would react. During one of his NBC shows, Kovacs was appearing as the inept magician Matzoh Hepplewhite. The sketch called for the magician to frequently hit a gong, which was the signal for a sexy female assistant to bring out a bottle and shot glass for a quick swig of alcohol. Stagehands substituted real liquor for the iced tea normally used for the skit. Kovacs realized that he would be called upon to drink a shot of liquor for each successive gong. He pressed on with the sketch and was quite inebriated by the end of the show.

Kovacs helped develop camera tricks still common decades after his death. His character Eugene sat at a table to eat his lunch, but as he removed items one at a time from a lunch box, he watched them inexplicably roll down the table into the lap of a man reading a newspaper at the other end. When Kovacs poured milk from a thermos bottle, the stream flowed in a seemingly unusual direction. Never seen on television before, the secret was using a tilted set in front of a camera tilted at the same angle.

He constantly sought new techniques and used both primitive and improvised ways of creating visual effects that would later be done electronically. One innovative construction involved attaching a kaleidoscope made from a toilet-paper roll to a camera lens with cardboard and tape and setting the resulting abstract images to music. Another was a soup can with both ends removed fitted with angled mirrors. Used on a camera and turning it could put Kovacs seemingly on the ceiling. An underwater stunt involved cigar smoker Kovacs sitting in an easy chair, reading his newspaper and somehow smoking a cigar. Removing it from his mouth, Kovacs was able to exhale a puff of white smoke, all while floating underwater. The trick: the &quot;smoke&quot; was a small amount of milk which he filled his mouth with before submerging. Kovacs repeated the effect for a Dutch Masters television commercial on his ABC game show, &quot;Take A Good Look&quot;.
One of the special effects he employed made it appear as if he was able to look through his assistant Barbara Loden&#x27;s head. The illusion was performed by placing a black patch on Loden&#x27;s head and standing her against a black background while one studio camera was trained on her. A second one photographed Kovacs, who used the studio monitor to position himself exactly so that his eye would appear to be looking through a hole in her head.

He also developed such routines as an all-gorilla version of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, a poker game set to Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fifth Symphony&quot;, the skit &quot;Silent Show&quot;, in which Eugene interacts with the world accompanied solely by music and sound effects, parodies of typical television commercials and movie genres, and various musical segments with everyday items (such as kitchen appliances or office equipment) moving in sync to music. A popular recurring skit was The Nairobi Trio, three derby-hatted apes (Kovacs, his wife, Edie Adams in gorilla suits; and frequently, the third ape was Kovacs&#x27; best friend Jack Lemmon) miming mechanically and rhythmically to the tune of Robert Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;Solfeggio&quot;.

Kovacs used extended sketches and mood pieces or quick blackout gags lasting only seconds. Some could be expensive, such as his famous used-car salesman routine with a jalopy and a breakaway floor: it cost $12,000 to produce the six-second gag. He was one of the first television comedians to use odd fake credits and comments between the legitimate credits and, at times, during his routines.

Kovacs reportedly disliked working in front of a live audience, as was the case with the shows he did for NBC during the 1950s. He found the presence of an audience distracting, and those in the seats frequently did not understand some of the more elaborate visual gags and special effects, which could only be appreciated by watching studio monitors instead of the stage.

Like many comedians of the era, Kovacs created a rotation of recurring roles. In addition to the silent &quot;Eugene,&quot; his most familiar characters were the fey, lisping poet Percy Dovetonsils, and the heavily accented German radio announcer, Wolfgang von Sauerbraten. Mr. Question Man, who answered viewer queries, was a satire on the long-run (1937–56) radio series, &quot;The Answer Man&quot;. Others included horror show host Auntie Gruesome, bumbling magician Matzoh Hepplewhite, Frenchman Pierre Ragout, and sardonic Hungarian cooking-show host Miklos Molnar. The Miklos character wasn&#x27;t always confined to a kitchen; Kovacs performed a parody of &quot;The Howdy Doody Show&quot; with &quot;Buffalo Miklos&quot; as the host. Poet Percy Dovetonsils can be found playing Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; on a disappearing piano and as a &quot;Master Detective&quot; on the &quot;Private Eye-Private Eye&quot; presentation of the &quot;US Steel Hour&quot; on CBS March 8, 1961. On the same show, the Nairobi Trio abandons its instruments for a safe-cracking job; still with a background of &quot;Solfeggio&quot;, but speaking, two of the three appear in an &quot;Outer Space&quot; sketch. 
Kovacs became a regular on NBC Radio&#x27;s program &quot;Monitor&quot; beginning during late 1958, often using his Mr. Question Man character in his radio monologues.
Kovacs never hesitated to lampoon those considered institutions of radio and television. In April 1954, he started the late-night talk show, &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot;, on DuMont Television Network&#x27;s New York flagship station, WABD. Stage, screen and radio notables were often guests. Archie Bleyer, head of Cadence Records, came to chat one evening. Bleyer had been the long-time orchestra director for Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s radio and television shows. He had been dismissed by Godfrey the year before, together with fellow cast member, singer Julius La Rosa. In La Rosa&#x27;s case, he hired a manager, defying an unwritten Godfrey policy. With Bleyer, Godfrey was angered when he found that Bleyer&#x27;s record company Cadence Records had produced spoken-word material by Don McNeill, host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Don McNeill&#x27;s Breakfast Club&quot;, which Godfrey considered competition to his show. Bleyer and Kovacs were shown in split screen, with Kovacs wearing a red wig, headphones, and playing a ukulele in a Godfrey imitation, while talking with his guest.

Kovacs&#x27;s television programs included &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot; (an early morning program seen on Philadelphia&#x27;s WPTZ from 1950 through 1952), &quot;It&#x27;s Time for Ernie&quot; (1951, his first network series), &quot;Ernie in Kovacsland&quot;, (a summer replacement show for Kukla, Fran and Ollie, 1951), &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot; (1952–56 on various networks), a twice-a-week job filling in for Steve Allen as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on Mondays and Tuesdays (1956–57), and game shows &quot;Gamble on Love&quot;, &quot;One Minute Please&quot;, &quot;Time Will Tell&quot; (all on DuMont), and &quot;Take a Good Look&quot; (1959–61). Kovacs was also the host of a program, &quot;Silents Please&quot;, which showed silent movies on network television, with serious discussion about the movies and their actors.

During the summer of 1957, Kovacs was a celebrity panelist on the television series &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, appearing in 10 of the season&#x27;s 13 episodes. He took his responsibilities less than seriously, often eschewing a legitimate question for the sake of a laugh. An example: Industrialist Henry J. Kaiser, the founder of an automobile company, was the program&#x27;s &quot;mystery guest.&quot; Previous questioning had established that the mystery guest&#x27;s name was synonymous with an automobile brand, Kovacs asked, &quot;Are you – and this is just a wild guess – but are you Abraham Lincoln?&quot;—a reference to the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Lincoln automobiles. Kovacs gave an interview admitting that he was absent from the show when he wanted to go out for dinner on a Sunday, leading the reporter to offer that as the reason for Kovacs leaving the series. Actually, Kovacs&#x27;s participation ended because his contract was up—the summer season was over. Goodson and Todman valued Kovacs&#x27;s presence in the summer series and kept him on as a guest panelist. According to &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; producer Gil Fates, &quot;We offered him a contract and a permanent place on the panel but, wisely, Ernie didn&#x27;t want to tie himself down [to New York] at that point in a burgeoning career. He did his last show with us in November of that year, then went to California to work and live.&quot;

==TV specials==

He also did several television specials, including the famous &quot;Silent Show&quot; (1957), featuring his character, Eugene: the first all-pantomime prime-time network program. After the end of the Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis partnership, NBC offered Lewis the opportunity to host his own 90-minute color television special. Lewis opted to use only 60 minutes, leaving the network 30 minutes to fill; no one wanted this time slot, but Kovacs was willing to have it. The program contained no spoken dialogue and contained only sound effects and music. Featuring Kovacs as the mute, Charlie Chaplin-like character &quot;Eugene&quot;, the program contained surreal sight gags. Kovacs developed the Eugene character during the autumn of 1956, when hosting the television series &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Expectations were high for the Lewis program, but it was Kovacs&#x27; special that received the most attention; Kovacs received his first movie offer, had a cover story in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, and received the Sylvania Award that year. 
In 1961, Kovacs and his co-director, Joe Behar, were recipients of the Directors Guild of America Award for a second version of this program broadcast by the American Broadcasting Company network.

A series of monthly half-hour specials for ABC during 1961–62 is often considered his best television work. Produced on videotape using new editing and special effects techniques, it won a 1962 Emmy Award. Kovacs and co-director Behar also won the Directors Guild of America award for an &quot;Ernie Kovacs Special&quot; based on the earlier, silent &quot;Eugene&quot; program. Kovacs&#x27; last ABC special was broadcast posthumously, on January 23, 1962.

The Dutch Masters cigar company became well known during the late 1950s and early 1960s for its sponsorship of various television projects of Ernie Kovacs. The company allowed Kovacs total creative control in the creation of their television commercials for his programs and specials. He produced a series of non-speaking television commercials for Dutch Masters during the run of his television series &quot;Take A Good Look&quot; which was praised by both television critics and viewers.

While praised by critics, Kovacs rarely had a highly rated show. The Museum of Broadcast Communications says, &quot;It is doubtful that Ernie Kovacs would find a place on television today. He was too zany, too unrestrained, too undisciplined. Perhaps Jack Gould of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it best for Ernie Kovacs: &#x27;The fun was in trying&#x27;.&quot;

Other shows had greater success while using elements of Kovacs&#x27;s style. George Schlatter, producer of the later television series &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, was married to actress Jolene Brand, who had appeared in Kovacs&#x27; comic troupes over the years and had been a frequent participant in his pioneering sketches. &quot;Laugh-In&quot; made frequent use of the quick blackout gags and surreal humor that marked many Kovacs projects. Another link was a young NBC staffer, Bill Wendell, Kovacs&#x27;s usual announcer and sometimes a sketch participant. From 1980 to 1995, Wendell was the announcer for David Letterman.
==The Music Man==
Kovacs was also known for his eclectic musical taste. His main theme song was named &quot;Oriental Blues&quot; by Jack Newton. The rendition most often heard was a piano-driven trio version, but, for his primetime show during 1956, music director Harry Sosnik presented a full-blown big-band version. The German song &quot;Die Moritat von Mackie Messer&quot; from &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (anglicized to &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;), frequently underscored his blackout routines.

Kovacs was introduced to harpist-songwriter Robert Maxwell&#x27;s recent instrumental &quot;Solfeggio&quot; in 1954 by Barry Shear, his director at DuMont Television Network. In the 1982 TV special &quot;Ernie Kovacs: Television&#x27;s Original Genius&quot;, Edie Adams recalled that when Kovacs first heard &quot;Solfeggio&quot;, he immediately knew how he wanted to use it. He conceived of three music-box-like apes in costume, who moved in time to the tune, and christened them The Nairobi Trio. Maxwell&#x27;s 1953 record of &quot;Solfeggio&quot; became so identified with the ape act that the record was re-released in 1957 as &quot;Song of the Nairobi Trio.&quot;
Kovacs matched an unusual treatment of &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;, by Mexican bandleader Juan García Esquivel, to video of an empty office in which various items (pencil sharpeners, water coolers, wall clocks) come to life in rhythm with the music; it was a variation on several famous animations of a decade earlier. The original three-minute presentation was outlined by Kovacs in a four-page, single-spaced memo to his staff. The perfectionist Kovacs describes in minute detail what had to be done and how to do it. The memo ends with this: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how the hell you&#x27;re going to get this done by Sunday – but &#x27;rots of ruck.&quot; (signed) &quot;Ernie (with love)&quot;. Kovacs also made careful use of the shrill singer Leona Anderson—who had somewhat less than a classical voice, by some estimations—in comic vignettes.

Kovacs used classical music as background for silent skits or abstract visual routines, including &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot;, by Béla Bartók; music from the opera &quot;The Love of Three Oranges&quot;, by Sergei Prokofiev; the finale of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s suite &quot;The Firebird&quot;; and Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&#x27;s Merry Pranks&quot;; and, from George Gershwin, &quot;Rialto Ripples&quot;—the theme to his shows—as well as parts of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Concerto in F&quot;. He may have been known best for using Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;String Quartet, Opus 3, Number 5&quot; (the &quot;Serenade,&quot; actually composed by Roman Hoffstetter) for a series of 1960–61 commercials he created and videotaped for his sponsor, Dutch Masters.

For the show of May 22, 1959, &quot;Kovacs on Music&quot;, Kovacs began by saying, &quot;I have never really understood classical music, so I would like to take this opportunity to explain it to others.&quot; He presented a gorilla version of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; which differed from the usual performance only in the persona of the dancers, along with giant paper clips moving to music and other sketches.

He also served as host on a jazz album to benefit the American Cancer Society in 1957, &quot;Listening to Jazz with Ernie Kovacs&quot;. It was a 15-minute recording featuring some of the celebrities of the art, including pianist Jimmy Yancey and old original New Orleans Jazz Trumpeter Bunk Johnson, soprano saxophonist Sidney Bechet, guitarist Django Reinhardt, composer/pianist/bandleader Duke Ellington and longtime Ellington trumpeter Cootie Williams. Both the Library of Congress and the National Library of Canada have copies of this recording in their collections.

==Works==
Kovacs wrote a novel, &quot;Zoomar: A Sophisticated Novel about Love and TV&quot; (Doubleday, 1957), based on television pioneer Pat Weaver; it took Kovacs only 13 days to write. The book took its title from the Zoomar brand zoom lenses frequently used on television cameras at the time. In a 1960 interview, Edie Adams related that the novel was written after Kovacs&#x27; experiences with network television while he was preparing to broadcast the &quot;Silent Show&quot;. The 1961 British edition was retitled &quot;T.V. Medium Rare&quot; by its London-based publisher, Transworld.

While he worked on several other book projects, Kovacs&#x27;s only other published title was &quot;How to Talk at Gin&quot;, published posthumously in 1962. He intended part of the book&#x27;s proceeds to benefit Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

During 1955–58, he wrote for &quot;Mad&quot; (his favorite humor magazine), including the feature &quot;Strangely Believe It!&quot; (a parody of &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; that was a regular feature of his television shows) and &quot;Gringo&quot;, a board game with ridiculously complicated rules that was renamed &quot;Droongo&quot; for the television show. Kovacs also wrote the introduction to the 1958 collection &quot;Mad For Keeps: A Collection of the Best from Mad Magazine&quot;.

==Television guest star==
Kovacs and Edie Adams guest starred on what turned out to be the final episode of &quot;The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show&quot;, (syndicated as &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot; or &quot;We Love Lucy&quot;) &quot;Lucy Meets the Moustache&quot;, which was in rehearsals during the week of February 28 and filmed on March 3 for an April 1, 1960 network broadcast. &quot;Lucy Meets the Moustache&quot; was the last time Arnaz and Ball worked together and the last time their famous characters appeared in a first-run broadcast. According to Adams, Ball and Arnaz &#x27;avoided contact and barely talked to each other in rehearsals and in-between scenes&#x27;. Adams also said that they were not told their episode was the last or that the famous couple was to divorce (Ball entered the uncontested divorce request March 4, 1960).

Kovacs also appeared in roles on other television programs. For &quot;General Electric Theater&#x27;s&quot; &quot;I Was a Bloodhound&quot; in 1959, Kovacs played the role of detective Barney Colby, whose extraordinary sense of smell helped him solve many seemingly-impossible cases. Colby was hired by a foreign country to recover its symbol of royalty, a baby elephant, who was being held for ransom.

==Films==
Kovacs found Hollywood success as a character actor, often typecast as a swarthy military officer (almost always a &quot;Captain&quot; of some sort) in such films as &quot;Operation Mad Ball&quot;, &quot;Wake Me When It&#x27;s Over&quot; and &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot;. While working in his first film role for &quot;Operation Mad Ball&quot;, Kovacs was filming a wild party scene after midnight; it was decided to use real champagne for realism. After a few hours of work, someone came up to Kovacs and remarked that he had been having quite a good time chasing starlets all night. Kovacs told the stranger to go to hell, since he was following the script; he later learned the stranger was Harry Cohn, head of Columbia Pictures. Kovacs and Cohn later became friends despite the way they had met, with Cohn giving Kovacs roles in &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; (1958) and &quot;It Happened to Jane&quot; (1959).

He garnered critical acclaim for film roles such as the perennially-inebriated writer in &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; and as the cartoonishly-evil head of a railroad company (who resembled Orson Welles&#x27; title character in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;) in &quot;It Happened to Jane&quot;, where he had his head shaved and his remaining hair dyed grey for the role. In 1960, he played the base commander Charlie Stark in the comedy &quot;Wake Me When It&#x27;s Over&quot; and the con man Frankie Cannon trying to steal John Wayne&#x27;s gold mine in the western comedy, &quot;North to Alaska&quot;. His own personal favorite was said to have been the offbeat &quot;Five Golden Hours&quot; (1961), in which he portrayed a larcenous professional mourner who meets his match in a professional widow played by Cyd Charisse. Kovacs&#x27;s last movie, &quot;Sail a Crooked Ship&quot; (also 1961), was released one month before his death.

==Personal life==

===First marriage===
Kovacs and his first wife, Bette Wilcox, were married on August 13, 1945. When the marriage ended, he fought for custody of their children, Elizabeth (&quot;Bette&quot;) and Kip Raleigh (&quot;Kippie&quot;). The court awarded Kovacs full custody upon determining that his former wife was mentally unstable. The decision was extremely unusual at the time, setting a legal precedent. Wilcox subsequently kidnapped the children, taking them to Florida. After a long and expensive search, Kovacs regained custody. These events were portrayed in the television movie &quot;Ernie Kovacs: Between the Laughter&quot; (1984), which garnered an Emmy Award nomination for its writer, April Smith. Kovacs was portrayed by Jeff Goldblum.

Kovacs&#x27;s first wife made a legal attempt to gain custody of her two daughters soon after his death. She began August 2, 1962, by claiming (equivalent to $ million in ) was her share of Kovacs&#x27;s estate and charging that her ex-husband had abducted the girls in 1955; Kovacs had been granted legal custody of his daughters in 1952. On August 30, Wilcox filed an affidavit claiming that Kovacs&#x27;s widow, Edie Adams, the stepmother to the girls, was &quot;unfit&quot; to care for them. Both daughters, Bette and Kippie, testified that they wanted to stay with their stepmother, Edie. Kippie&#x27;s testimony was very emotional; in it she referred to Edie as &quot;Mommy&quot; and her birth mother as &quot;the other lady.&quot; Upon hearing the verdict that the girls would remain in their home, Adams wept, saying, &quot;This is what Ernie would have wanted. Now I can smile.&quot; Bette&#x27;s reaction was &quot;I&#x27;m so happy I can hardly express myself&quot;, after learning she and her sister would not be forced to leave Edie.

===Second marriage===

Kovacs and Adams met in 1951 when she was hired to work for his WPTZ show, &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot;. Her appearance on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; caught the eye of Kovacs&#x27;s producer, and he asked her to audition for the program. A classically trained singer, she was able to perform only three popular songs. Edie said later, &quot;I sang them all during the audition, and if they had asked to hear another, I never would have made it.&quot; Quoting Kovacs, &quot;I wish I could say I was the big shot that hired her, but it was my show in name only – the producer had all the say. Later on I did have something to say and I said it: &#x27;Let&#x27;s get married.&#x27;&quot;

After the couple&#x27;s first date, Kovacs proceeded to buy a Jaguar car, telling Adams he wanted to take her out in style. He was seriously taken with the beautiful and talented young woman, courting her with imagination and flair. Kovacs&#x27;s attempts to win Adams&#x27; affection included hiring a mariachi band to serenade her backstage at the Broadway musical she was performing in and the sudden gift of a diamond engagement ring, telling her to wear it until she made up her mind. Kovacs continued this romantic quest after the show went out of town.

Adams booked a six-week European cruise, which she hoped would let her make up her mind whether or not to marry Kovacs. After only three days away and many long-distance telephone calls, she curtailed her trip and returned to say &quot;yes&quot;. They eloped and were married on September 12, 1954, in Mexico City. The ceremony was presided over by former New York City mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer and was performed in Spanish, which neither Kovacs nor Adams understood; O&#x27;Dwyer had to prompt each of them to say &quot;Sí&quot; at the &quot;I do&quot; portion of the vows. Adams, who had a middle-class upbringing, was smitten by Kovacs&#x27;s quirky ways; the couple remained together until his death. (She later said about Kovacs, &quot;He treated me like a little girl, and I loved it—Women&#x27;s Lib be damned!&quot;)

Adams also aided Kovacs&#x27;s struggle to reclaim his two older children after the kidnapping by their mother. She also was a regular partner on his television shows. Kovacs usually introduced or addressed her in a businesslike way, as &quot;Edith Adams&quot;. Adams was usually willing to do anything he envisioned, whether it was singing seriously, performing impersonations (including a well-regarded impression of Marilyn Monroe) or taking a pie in the face or a pratfall if and when needed. The couple had one daughter, Mia Susan Kovacs, born June 20, 1959. Mia also died in a car crash in 1982, at age 22.

Kovacs and his family shared a 16-room apartment in Manhattan on Central Park West that seemed perfect until he went to California for his first film role in &quot;Operation Mad Ball&quot;. The experience of the totally different, laid-back lifestyle of Hollywood made a big impression on him. He realized he was working too much in New York; in California he would be able to work fewer hours, do just as well or better and have more time for Edie and his daughters. At the time, he was working most of the time and sleeping about two or three hours a night. Kovacs claimed that he realized it was time for a change when he was telling his girls a bedtime story and found himself thinking of using it for a show instead. Kovacs relocated his family there in 1957, after Edie finished work for the Broadway play &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;.

==Death==
In the early morning hours of January 13, 1962, Kovacs lost control of his Chevrolet Corvair station wagon while turning quickly and crashed into a power pole in West Los Angeles. He was thrown halfway out the vehicle&#x27;s passenger side and died almost instantly from chest and head injuries.
A photographer arrived soon after and images of Kovacs&#x27; bodywith an unlit cigar on the pavement near his outstretched handappeared in newspapers across the United States.

In keeping with Kovacs&#x27;s wishes, a simple service was held at the Beverly Hills Community Presbyterian Church. The pallbearers included Ernie&#x27;s best friend Jack Lemmon, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Billy Wilder, and Mervyn LeRoy. George Burns, Groucho Marx, Edward G. Robinson, Kirk Douglas, Jack Benny, James Stewart, Charlton Heston, Buster Keaton and Milton Berle also attended. The pastor said that Kovacs had summed up his life thus: &quot;I was born in Trenton, New Jersey in 1919 to a Hungarian couple. I&#x27;ve been smoking cigars ever since.&quot;
He is buried in Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. His epitaph reads &quot;Nothing in moderation—We all loved him.&quot;

There is a street named after Kovacs in San Antonio, Texas.

==Tax evasion==
A frequent critic of the U.S. tax system, Kovacs owed the Internal Revenue Service several hundred thousand dollars in back taxes, due to his refusal to pay the bulk of them. Up to 90% of his earnings were garnished as a result. His long battles with the IRS inspired Kovacs to invest his money in a convoluted series of paper corporations in the U.S. and Canada. He would give them bizarre names, such as &quot;The Bazooka Dooka Hicka Hocka Hookah Company&quot;. In 1961, Kovacs was served with a $75,000 lien for back taxes; that same day he bought the California Racquet Club with the apparent hope of being able to use it as a tax write-off. The property had mortgages at the time of purchase which were later paid by his wife, Edie Adams.

His tax woes also affected Kovacs&#x27;s career, forcing him to take any offered work to pay his debt. This included the ABC game show &quot;Take a Good Look&quot;, appearances on variety shows such as NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;, and some of his less-memorable film roles. He also filmed an unaired 1962 pilot episode for a proposed CBS series, &quot;Medicine Man&quot; (co-starring Buster Keaton; the pilot episode titled &quot;A Pony for Chris&quot;). Kovacs&#x27;s role was that of Dr. P. Crookshank, a traveling medicine salesman in the 1870s, who was selling Mother McGreevy&#x27;s Wizard Juice, also known as &quot;man&#x27;s best friend in a bottle&quot;. This was abandoned after his death, which occurred the day after filming some scenes in Griffith Park for the pilot. CBS initially intended to broadcast the show as part of a summer replacement program, &quot;The Comedy Spot&quot;, but decided against it due to problems with Kovacs&#x27; estate. The pilot is part of the public collection of the Paley Center for Media.

Some of the issues regarding Kovacs&#x27; tax problems were still unresolved years after his death. Kovacs had purchased two insurance policies in 1951; his mother was named as the primary beneficiary of them. The IRS placed a lien against them both for their cash value in 1961. To stop the actions being taken against her, Mary Kovacs had to go to Federal court. The court&#x27;s early 1966 ruling resolved the issue, with the last sentence of the document reading: &quot;Prima facie, it looks as if, within the limits of discretion permitted the government by the relevant statutes, an injustice is being done to Mary Kovacs.&quot;

Adams, who married and divorced twice after Kovacs&#x27; death, refused help from celebrity friends who planned a benefit for the purpose. &quot;I can take care of my own children,&quot; she said, and resolved to accept offers only from those who wanted to hire her for her talents. Adams eventually paid all of Kovacs&#x27;s debts.

==Lost and surviving work==
Most of Kovacs&#x27;s early television work was performed live: some kinescopes have survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube/Kovacs/Collection&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Corner/playlist/Kovacs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some videotapes of his ABC specials were preserved; others, such as his quirky game show, &quot;Take a Good Look&quot;, were available mostly in short segments until recently, with the release of some complete, videotaped episodes. After Kovacs&#x27;s death, Adams discovered not only that her husband owed ABC a great deal of money, but that some networks were systematically erasing and reusing tapes of Kovacs&#x27;s shows or disposing of the kinescopes and videotapes. She succeeded in purchasing the rights to surviving footage with the proceeds from Kovacs&#x27; insurance policy and her own earnings after Kovacs&#x27; IRS debts were paid. In March 1996, Adams detailed her experiences before the National Film Preservation Board.
Adams first used some of the videotapes she had purchased for a 1968 ABC television special, &quot;The Comedy of Ernie Kovacs&quot;; to produce the show, she hired Kovacs&#x27;s former producer and editor. The hour-long program was sponsored by Kovacs&#x27;s former sponsor, Dutch Masters.

Most of Kovacs&#x27;s salvaged work is available to researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles Library&#x27;s Department of Special Collections: additional material is available at the Paley Center for Media.

Telecasts of edited compilations of some of his work by PBS (station WTTW, Chicago) under the title &quot;The Best of Ernie Kovacs&quot; in 1977, inspired the film. These broadcasts were made available on VHS and DVD. The DVD set features extras that are not in the VHS set. The series was narrated by long time friend, Jack Lemmon. The 1984 television film &quot;Ernie Kovacs: Between the Laughter&quot; helped return Kovacs to the public&#x27;s attention, though the show emphasized his bid to retrieve his kidnapped children instead of his professional life. Jeff Goldblum portrayed Kovacs, Madolyn Smith portrayed Bette and Melody Anderson portrayed Adams in the movie. Edie Adams appeared in a cameo in this film, playing Mae West; it was one of the impressions she performed in shows with Kovacs.

During the early 1990s, The Comedy Channel broadcast a series of Kovacs&#x27; shows under the generic title of &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot;. The series included both the ABC specials and some of his 1950s shows from NBC. By 2008, there were no broadcast, cable, or satellite channels broadcasting any of Kovacs&#x27;s television work, other than his panel appearances on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; on the Game Show Network. 

On April 19, 2011, Shout! Factory released &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Collection&quot;, six DVDs spanning Kovacs&#x27;s television career. The company&#x27;s website also offers an extra disc with material from &quot;Tonight!&quot; and &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot;, as well as a rare color kinescope of the complete 30-minute 1957 NBC color broadcast featuring &quot;Eugene&quot;. On October 23, 2012, Shout! Factory released The Ernie Kovacs Collection: Volume 2 on DVD. The 49 surviving episodes of the game show &quot;Take a Good Look&quot; were released on DVD by Shout! Factory on October 17, 2017.

In 1961, Kovacs recorded a record album of poetry in the character of Percy Dovetonsils named &quot;Percy Dovetonsils Thpeakth&quot;, but was unable to release it due to contractual obligations with other record companies. After he was given the masters, Kovacs donated them to a Los Angeles area hospital. Adams was able to re-acquire the tapes in 1967, and they remained part of her private collection until her death in 2008. The tapes were labeled as movie material and were thought to be such until further examination proved they were Kovacs as Percy reading his poems with no music background. The album was finally released in 2012.

Kovacs was inducted posthumously into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1992.

<text>Cara Sucia (English title: &quot;Dirty Face&quot;) is a Venezuelan telenovela written by Carlos Romero and Alberto Gómez and produced by Venevisión in 1992. The telenovela was distributed internationally by Venevisión International and was dubbed into English, Russian, Mongolian, Indonesian, and (Filipino) in the Philippines. Guillermo Dávila and Sonya Smith starred as the main protagonists with Gigi Zanchetta and Humberto García as the main antagonists.

==Plot==
Miguel Ángel González is a member of one of Caracas&#x27; richest families while Estrella is a poor but hard-working beautiful girl who sells newspapers in a corner everyday to earn a living. When they meet, they fall in love and begin a beautiful romance that leads to marriage. However, not everything is rosy for the couple. Miguel Ángel&#x27;s parents Horacio and Rebecca are opposed to the relationship, and the obsessive passion Santa Ortigoza, Miguel Ángel&#x27;s ex-girlfriend has over him. Horacio&#x27;s declining mental health makes him become more and more dangerous, and he hides a secret from the past: many years ago, he murdered Estrella&#x27;s mother because she rejected him and let her father be blamed for the crime. The secret is revealed once Leonardo Montenegro, Estrella&#x27;s father, is released from prison and reunited with his daughter. Rebecca, Miguel Ángel&#x27;s mother, begins to accept his relationship with Estrella once she learns about Horacio&#x27;s secret and that she was wrong about Estrella being a gold digger, when it was actually Santa who was after their family&#x27;s money.

Later, Horacio kidnaps Estrella and Miguel Ángel&#x27;s twin boys, and during this time, he has begun loving them like his sons. He shoots himself after a police stand-off when the babies are wrestled away from him while Santa dies after her car is driven off a cliff.

<doc id="99981" wikidata="Q572227" url="?curid=99981" title="International Boxing Hall of Fame">
<text>The International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHOF), located in Canastota, New York, right next to exit 34 of the New York State Thruway, honors boxers, trainers and other contributors to the sport worldwide. Inductees are selected on ballots created through screened public nominations by members of the Boxing Writers Association of America.

The IBHOF started as a 1980s initiative by Ed Brophy and other locals to honor Canastota&#x27;s world boxing champions, Carmen Basilio and Basilio&#x27;s nephew, Billy Backus; the village of Canastota inaugurated the new museum in 1989 which showcases boxing&#x27;s rich history. With the opening of the Oneida Indian Nation’s Turing Stone Casino in the nearby city of Verona in the early 90s, a relationship was developed whereas various IBHOF Hall of Fame Weekend events were hosted at the casino. Today, the IBHOF is visited by boxing fans from all over the world.

An earlier hall had been created in 1954, when &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame was launched, located at Madison Square Garden in New York City. When that Boxing Hall of Fame was disbanded in 1987, it had a total of 155 inductees. , all but 13 of those 155 have also been inducted to the IBHOF. Beginning in 2020, the IBHOF began inducting female boxers for the first time since its inception.

The IBHOF is one of two recognized Boxing Halls of Fame with the other being the World Boxing Hall of Fame (WBHF), with the IBHOF being the more widely recognized institution.

Ceremonies have been held every second Sunday in June since 1990 to honor inductees but were postponed in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19. Events are attended by many former world boxing champions, as well as boxing and Hollywood celebrities. Artist Richard T. Slone has been the official artist of the IBHOF since 1997, creating portraits of inductees and other works for the Hall.

==Eligibility==

Professional boxers become eligible for election into the International Boxing Hall of Fame three years after their retirement (previously used to be five years before 2019). Inductees are selected by members of the Boxing Writers Association of America and an international panel of boxing historians, based on criteria in five separate categories:

* Modern: Retired boxers whose last bout was no earlier than 1989. Prior to a 2014 rule change, the category reflected boxers whose last bout was after 1943.
* Old Timers: Until 2014, the rule was boxers whose last bout was no earlier than 1893 and no later than 1942. This category has since changed, similar to the Veterans Committee in baseball&#x27;s Hall of Fame. It is now split into two categories.
** Early Era: Boxers who fought from the beginning of Marquis of Queensbury Rules (1893) until 1942.
** Late Era: Boxers who fought their bout from 1943 to 1988 
* Pioneers: Boxers whose last bout was in or prior to 1892. Generally, they are boxers who fought before the Marquis of Queensbury Rules.
* Observers: Journalists, historians, writers and artists.
* Non-Participants: People who made contributions to the sport of boxing apart from their roles as boxers or observers.

<text>Herringfleet is a place and former civil parish, now in the parish of Somerleyton, Ashby and Herringfleet, in the East Suffolk district, in the north of the English county of Suffolk. It is located north-west of Lowestoft. The parish was combined with Somerleyton and Ashby to create the parish of &quot;Somerleyton, Ashby and Herringfleet&quot; on 1 April 1987.

The western edge of Herringfleet is marked by the River Waveney. Prior to local government reorganisation in 1974, the former parish included the village of St Olaves to the north. This was combined with the parish of Fritton and the new parish of Fritton and St Olaves transferred to the county of Norfolk. Previously the entire area south and east of the River Waveney was part of Suffolk.

Prior to the loss of St Olaves, the population of the former parish was 262 at the 1961 United Kingdom census. At the 1981 census it was 58 and the current population of Herringfleet is estimated to be around 50. There is no village centre, with the population spread across a number of scattered farms and small settlements. Much of the land within the area of the former parish is owned by the Somerleyton Estate.

==History==

Herringfleet was occupied during the Roman period, and there have been archaeological finds made dating occupation to the neolithic period. According to the Domesday Book of 1086, a manor of one carucate was owned by the King.

The place-name ‘Herringfleet’ is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as ‘Herlingaflet’. It appears as ‘Herlingefleth’ in the Feet of Fines in 1202, as ‘Herlingflet’ in 1254 in the ‘Valuation of Norwich’, and as ‘Heringflete’ circa 1255 in the ‘Calendar of Charters and Rolls in the Bodleian Library’. The name means “the stream of Herala’s people”.

During the medieval period, a ferry was established across the Waveney at St Olaves. St Olaves Priory was founded nearby in about 1216 by Roger Fitz Osbert as an Augustinian priory. It was dedicated to St Olav and operated until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537, controlling the Herringfleet parish church as well as those at Burgh St Peter and Hales as well as land at Tibenham. The site is largely in ruins, although the undercroft survives in good condition.

By around 1509 the first stone bridge across the Waveney had been built, possibly replacing a bridge first mentioned in 1298. This was replaced with a cast iron bowstring girder suspension bridge in 1847. The bridge is the only crossing point on the Waveney between Great Yarmouth and Beccles.

Henry Jerningham owned the priory site by 1546 and a Tudor manor house was built on the site. By the 18th century the manor was owned by the Leathes family, and Herringfleet Hall dates from this time, the new hall having been built to replace an older manor house to the south. A series of duck decoys are known to have been operated at Fritton Decoy at the north-east boundary of the former parish at this time, and are believed to date from the 17th century.

The Great Yarmouth to Beccles railway line opened in 1859 and passed through the former parish, with a station at St Olaves. This operated until 1959. On the western edge of the former parish, Herringfleet Windmill, a timber smock drainpipe windpump, was built in about 1820. It is a Grade II* listed building and is within the area of The Broads national park.

During World War II parts of the parish, including the area around Fritton Decoy, were used for training ahead of the Normandy landings in 1944. The 79th Armoured Division used the site for the testing and development of amphibious DD tanks from 1943, and it was used until 1947 as part of the British Army&#x27;s Assault Training and Development Centre, and later became part of the Specialised Armour Development Establishment. Other areas in Herringfleet and the surrounding area were used as campsites for the units involved in training.

==Church of St Margaret==

The parish church, which is dedicated to St Margaret, is one of around 40 round-tower churches in Suffolk. It dates from the medieval period, with the tower thought to date from the 11th-century at the latest, with a possibility of it dating from the Anglo-Saxon period, although this is considered unlikely due to its construction in Caen stone. The parish came under the control of St Olave’s Priory after it was established in the 13th century.

The nave doorway dates from the 12th century and there are 12th- and 13th-century windows in both the nave and chancel. The church was restored from 1824 by the Leathes family, and contains Victorian stained glass windows as well as painted glass dating from as early as the 14th century. The church is a Grade I listed building.

Two bells hang in the tower, one cast by William and Alice Brend of Norwich in 1611, the other by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1837.

<text>Una aventura llamada Menudo (English: An Adventure Called Menudo) is a 1982 film featuring teen boy band Menudo and Puerto Rican actress Gladys Rodríguez. The film&#x27;s soundtrack received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album.

==Synopsis==
In &quot;Una aventura llamada Menudo&quot;, Menudo members are supposed to fly to Ponce, Puerto Rico for a concert. However, having before arrived at concert sites by way of airplane, helicopter, and fire truck, and deciding during a meeting that arriving by motorcycle would be too dangerous due to wild crowds, band member Ricky Meléndez then hires the services of a hot air balloon company, and during their balloon flight to the concert site, they have trouble and crash-land on a beach near a mansion.

Rodríguez&#x27;s character, a big fan of Menudo who feels old and put aside by her young, hip nieces, lives in that mansion, along with her girls.

Looking for help, the Menudo guys arrive at the house, where they are given food and a room while they try to get in contact with their group director.

As the story develops, Menudo member Johnny Lozada falls in love with one of the girl residents, and Menudo members meet new friends, sing and dance their way through the story.

==Soundtrack album==
A Spanish language soundtrack album with the same title as the film was released in 1982. This is the eleventh album overall and the second album this line-up recorded together. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Performance. The album was released in CD format in 1998. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, its first-week sales reached 10,000 units, alongside the combined sales of &quot;Quiero Ser&quot;, &quot;Por Amor&quot; and &quot;Fuego&quot;. The group received a gold certification for the biggest selling Latin America record in United States, &quot;A Volar&quot;.

===Tracks===
&quot;Mi Banda Toca Rock&quot;, &quot;Súbete A Mi Moto&quot; and &quot;Quiero Rock&quot; appear as background (incidental) music in the film but do not appear on the soundtrack album. Rene Farrait, a former member who had already exited the group when the movie was filmed, also appears incidentally on the background, on a poster &quot;Señora Mia&quot; had of Menudo&#x27;s &quot;Quiero Ser&quot; album&#x27;s cover, which had been released in 1981. This album also contains the last two songs this version of the group (Menudo had over 30 members during its history, always grouped as a quintet) recorded together as a whole with Lluvia and Estrella Polar.

<text>William Olaf Stapledon (10 May 1886 – 6 September 1950) was an English philosopher and author of science fiction. In 2014, he was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.

==Life==
Stapledon was born in Seacombe, Wallasey, on the Wirral Peninsula in Cheshire, the only son of William Clibbett Stapledon and Emmeline Miller. The first six years of his life were spent with his parents at Port Said, Egypt. He was educated at Abbotsholme School in Derbyshire and Balliol College, Oxford, where he acquired a BA degree in Modern History (Second Class) in 1909, promoted to an MA degree in 1913. After a brief stint as a teacher at Manchester Grammar School he worked in shipping offices in Liverpool and Port Said from 1910 to 1912. From 1912 to 1915 Stapledon worked with the Liverpool branch of the Workers&#x27; Educational Association.

During the First World War he served as a conscientious objector. Stapledon became an ambulance driver with the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit in France and Belgium from July 1915 to January 1919; he was awarded the Croix de Guerre for bravery. His wartime experiences influenced his pacifist beliefs and advocacy of a World Government. On 16 July 1919 he married Agnes Zena Miller (1894–1984), an Australian cousin. They had first met in 1903, and later maintained a correspondence throughout the war. They had a daughter, Mary Sydney Stapledon (1920–2008), and a son, John David Stapledon (1923–2014). In 1920 they moved to West Kirby.

Stapledon was awarded a PhD degree in philosophy from the University of Liverpool in 1925 and used his doctoral thesis as the basis for his first published prose book, &quot;A Modern Theory of Ethics&quot; (1929). However, he soon turned to fiction in the hope of presenting his ideas to a wider public. The relative success of &quot;Last and First Men&quot; (1930) prompted him to become a full-time writer. He wrote a sequel, &quot;Last Men in London&quot;, and followed it up with many more books of both fiction and philosophy. Stapledon was a member of the Aristotelean Society.

As a pacifist Stapledon was involved in a number of peace-advocacy organisations, such as the Peace Pledge Union. In August 1939 he addressed a meeting of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom. For the duration of the Second World War Stapledon abandoned his pacifism and supported the war effort. In 1940 the Stapledon family built and moved into a new house on Simon&#x27;s Field, in Caldy, in Wirral. During the war Stapledon became a public advocate of J.B. Priestley and Richard Acland&#x27;s left-wing Common Wealth Party, as well as the British internationalist group Federal Union. He supported implementing the recommendations of the Beveridge Report and spoke at the first public meeting of the Left Book Club&#x27;s &quot;Readers&#x27; and Writers&#x27; Group&quot;.

Other organizations which Stapledon was involved with include the H.G. Wells Society, League of Nations Union, the 1941 Committee, the Progressive League and the British Interplanetary Society. 

Some commentators have called Stapledon a Marxist, although Stapledon distanced himself from the label stating that &quot;I am not a Marxist, but I have learned much from Marxists, and I am not anti-Marxist&quot;, though he did refer to himself as a socialist. He held membership of the Merseyside branch of the Fabian Society.

After 1945 Stapledon travelled widely on lecture tours. Arthur C. Clarke, as Chairman of the British Interplanetary Society, invited him to give a talk on the social and biological aspects of space exploration. He also travelled internationally, visiting the Netherlands, Sweden and France, and in 1948 he spoke at the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace in Wrocław, Poland. He attended the Conference for World Peace held in New York City in 1949, the only Briton to be granted a visa to do so. In 1950 he became involved with the anti-apartheid movement. After a week of lectures in Paris, he cancelled a projected trip to Yugoslavia and returned to his home in Caldy, where he died very suddenly of a heart attack.

Stapledon was cremated at Landican Crematorium. His widow and their children scattered his ashes on the sandy cliffs overlooking the Dee Estuary, a favourite spot of his that features in more than one of his books. Stapledon Wood, on the south-east side of Caldy Hill, is named after him.

==Works==
Stapledon&#x27;s fiction often presents the strivings of some intelligence that is beaten down by an indifferent universe and its inhabitants who, through no fault of their own, fail to comprehend its lofty yearnings. It is filled with protagonists who are tormented by the conflict between their &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; impulses.

Stapledon&#x27;s writings directly influenced Arthur C. Clarke, Brian Aldiss, Stanisław Lem, Bertrand Russell, John Gloag, Naomi Mitchison, C. S. Lewis, Vernor Vinge, John Maynard Smith and indirectly influenced many others, contributing many ideas to the world of science fiction. Clarke wrote:

Ideas such as a &quot;supermind&quot; composed of many individual consciousnesses forms a recurring theme in his work. &quot;Star Maker&quot; contains the first known description of what are now called Dyson spheres. Freeman Dyson credits the novel with giving him the idea, even stating in an interview that &quot;Stapledon sphere&quot; would be a more appropriate name. &quot;Last and First Men&quot; features early descriptions of genetic engineering and terraforming. &quot;Sirius&quot; describes a dog whose intelligence is increased to the level of a human being&#x27;s. Stapledon&#x27;s work also refers to then-contemporary intellectual fashions (e.g. the belief in extrasensory perception).

&quot;Last and First Men&quot;, a &quot;future history&quot; of 18 successive species of humanity, and &quot;Star Maker&quot;, an outline history of the Universe, were highly acclaimed by figures as diverse as Jorge Luis Borges, J. B. Priestley, Bertrand Russell, Algernon Blackwood, Hugh Walpole, Arnold Bennett, Virginia Woolf (Stapledon maintained a correspondence with Woolf) and Winston Churchill. In contrast, Stapledon&#x27;s philosophy repelled C. S. Lewis, whose &quot;Cosmic Trilogy&quot; was written partly in response to what Lewis saw as amorality, although Lewis admired Stapledon&#x27;s inventiveness and described him as &quot;a corking good writer&quot;. In fact Stapledon was an agnostic who was hostile to religious institutions, but not to religious yearnings, a fact that set him at odds with H. G. Wells in their correspondence.

Together with his philosophy lectureship at the University of Liverpool, which now houses the Olaf Stapledon archive, Stapledon lectured in English literature, industrial history and psychology. He wrote many non-fiction books on political and ethical subjects, in which he advocated the growth of &quot;spiritual values&quot;, which he defined as those values expressive of a yearning for greater awareness of the self in a larger context (&quot;personality-in-community&quot;). Stapledon himself named his spiritual values as intelligence, love and creative action. His philosophy was strongly influenced by Spinoza.

Stapledon is considered one of the forerunners of the contemporary transhumanist movement.

==Film rights==
Film producer and director George Pal bought the rights to &quot;Odd John&quot; and in 1966 &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot; magazine reported that David McCallum would play the title role.

In 2017 a multimedia adaptation of &quot;Last and First Men&quot; by Oscar-nominated Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson was released, featuring narration by Tilda Swinton and a live score performed by the BBC Philharmonic.

In 2019, Justin McDonald and Kate Hodgson wrote, produced, and starred in a short film adaptation of Stapledon&#x27;s &quot;A Modern Magician.&quot; Directed by Mark Heller, the film also featured the voice of Brian Cox. It was the first-ever live-action adaptation of any of Stapledon&#x27;s literary works.

<text>Douglas Bruce Lenat (September 13, 1950 – August 31, 2023) was an American computer scientist and researcher in artificial intelligence who was the founder and CEO of Cycorp, Inc. in Austin, Texas.

Lenat was awarded the biannual IJCAI Computers and Thought Award in 1976 for creating the machine-learning program AM. He has worked on (symbolic, not statistical) machine learning (with his AM and Eurisko programs), knowledge representation, &quot;cognitive economy&quot;, blackboard systems, and what he dubbed in 1984 &quot;ontological engineering&quot; (with his Cyc program at MCC and, since 1994, at Cycorp). He has also worked in military simulations, and numerous projects for the US government, military, intelligence, and scientific organizations. In 1980, he published a critique of conventional random-mutation Darwinism. He authored a series of articles in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence exploring the nature of heuristic rules.

Lenat was one of the original Fellows of the AAAI, and is the only individual to have served on the Scientific Advisory Boards of both Microsoft and Apple. He was a Fellow of the AAAS, AAAI, and Cognitive Science Society, and an editor of the J. Automated Reasoning, J. Learning Sciences, and J. Applied Ontology. He was one of the founders of TTI/Vanguard in 1991 and member of its advisory board. He was named one of the Wired 25.

==Background and education==
Lenat was born in Philadelphia, United States, on September 13, 1950. When he was 5, the family moved to Wilmington, Delaware, where his father, Nathan Lenat, owned a bottling plant. His father died when he was 13 and the family then returned to Pennsylvania, where he attended Cheltenham High School. His after-school job was cleaning rat cages and goose pens at Beaver College which motivated him to learn programming as a better occupation.

He attended the University of Pennsylvania, supporting himself by programming, including the design and development of a natural language interface for a United States Navy online operations manual. He graduated with bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Mathematics and Physics, and a master&#x27;s degree in Applied Mathematics, all in 1972.

For his senior thesis, advised in part by Dennis Gabor, was to bounce acoustic waves in the 40 MHz range off real-world objects, record their interference patterns on a 2-meter square plot, photo-reduce those to a 10-mm square film image, shine a laser through the film, and thus project the three-dimensional imaged object—i.e., the first known acoustic hologram. To settle an argument with Dr. Gabor, Lenat computer-generated a five-dimensional hologram, by photo-reducing computer printout of the interference pattern of a globe rotating and expanding over time, reducing the large two-dimensional paper printout to a moderately large 5-cm square film surface through which a conventional laser beam was then able to project a three-dimensional image, which changed in two independent ways (rotating and changing in size) as the film was moved up-down or left-right.

Lenat was a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford University, where his published research included automatic program synthesis from input/output pairs and from natural language clarification dialogues.

==Research==
In 1976, Lenat received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University, &quot;AM: Discovery in mathematics as heuristic search&quot; sponsored by ARPA. It was republished as &quot;Knowledge-based systems in artificial intelligence&quot;, along with the Ph.D. thesis of Randall Davis, McGraw-Hill, 1982. His thesis advisor was Professor Cordell Green.

His thesis, AM (Automated Mathematician) was one of the first computer programs that attempted to make discoveries, i.e., to be a theorem &quot;proposer&quot; rather than a theorem &quot;prover&quot;. Experimenting with the program fueled a cycle of criticism and improvement. Many issues had to be dealt with in constructing such a program: how to represent knowledge formally, expressively, and concretely, how to program hundreds of heuristic &quot;interestingness&quot; rules to judge the worth of new discoveries, heuristics for when to reason symbolically and inductively &quot;versus&quot; when to reason statistically from frequency data, what the architecture—the design constraints—of such reasoning programs might be, why heuristics work, and what their &quot;inner structure&quot; might be. AM was one of the first steps toward demonstrating that computer programs can make novel and creative discoveries.

In 1976, Lenat started teaching as an assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon and commenced his work on the AI program Eurisko. The limitation with AM was that it was locked into following a fixed set of interestingness heuristics; Eurisko, by contrast, represented its heuristic rules as first class objects and hence it could explore, manipulate, and discover new heuristics just as AM explored, manipulated, and discovered new domain concepts.

Lenat returned to Stanford as an assistant professor of computer science in 1978 and continued his research building the Eurisko automated discovery and heuristic-discovery program. Eurisko made many interesting discoveries and enjoyed significant acclaim, with Lenat&#x27;s paper &quot;Heuretics: Theoretical and Experimental Study of Heuristic Rules&quot; winning the Best Paper award at the 1982 AAAI conference.

==A call for &quot;common sense&quot;==
Lenat (working with John Seely Brown at Xerox PARC) published in 1984 an analysis of what were the limitations of his AM and Eurisko lines of research. It concluded that progress toward real, general, symbolic AI would require a vast knowledge base of &quot;common sense&quot;, suitably formalized and represented, and an inference engine capable of finding tens- or hundreds-deep conclusions and arguments that followed from the application of that knowledge base to specific questions and applications.

The successes, and analysis of the limitations, of this AM and Eurisko approach to AI, and the concluding plea for the massive (multi-thousand-person-year, decades-long) R&amp;D effort would be required to break that bottleneck to AI, led to attention in 1982 from Admiral Bob Inman and the then-forming MCC research consortium in Austin, Texas, culminating in Lenat&#x27;s becoming principal scientist of MCC from 1984–1994, though he continued even after this period to return to Stanford to teach approximately one course per year. At the 400-person MCC, Lenat was able to have several dozen researchers work on that common sense knowledge base, rather than just a few graduate students.

==Cycorp==
The fruits of the first decade of R&amp;D on Cyc were spun out of MCC into a company, Cycorp, at the end of 1994. In 1986, he estimated the effort to complete Cyc would be at least 250,000 rules and 1,000 person-years of effort, probably twice that, and by 2017, he and his team had spent about 2,000 person-years of effort building Cyc, creating approximately 24 million rules and assertions (not counting &quot;facts&quot;).

Lenat continued to work on Cyc as CEO of Cycorp until his death. While the first decade of work on Cyc (1984–1994) was funded by large American companies pooling long-term research funds to compete with the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Project, and the second decade (1995–2006) of work on Cyc was funded by US government agencies&#x27; research contracts, the third decade up through the present (2007–2023) has been largely supported through commercial applications of Cyc, including in the financial services, energy, and healthcare areas. One of these later projects was a learning by teaching application called Mathcraft.

==Personal life and death==
Lenat was married to Merle Baruch, with whom he had a daughter; they divorced and he later married Cycorp business manager Mary Shepherd. He died of bile duct cancer on August 31, 2023, at the age of 72.

==Quotes==

* &quot;Intelligence is ten million rules.&quot; This refers to the prior and tacit knowledge that authors presume their readers all possess (such as &quot;if person x knows person y, then x&#x27;s date of death can&#x27;t be earlier than y&#x27;s date of birth&quot;) &quot;not counting the vastly larger number of &quot;facts&quot; such as one might find in Wikipedia or by Googling.&quot;
* &quot;The time may come when a greatly expanded Cyc will underlie countless software applications. But reaching that goal could easily take another two decades.&quot;
* &quot;Once you have a truly massive amount of information integrated as knowledge, then the human-software system will be superhuman, in the same sense that mankind with writing is superhuman compared to mankind before writing.&quot;
* &quot;Sometimes the &quot;veneer&quot; of intelligence is not enough.&quot;
* “If computers were human, they’d present themselves as autistic, schizophrenic, or otherwise brittle. It would be unwise or dangerous for that person to take care of children and cook meals, but it’s on the horizon for home robots. That’s like saying, ‘We have an important job to do, but we’re going to hire dogs and cats to do it.&#x27;”
* &quot;What we needed, he says, is nothing less than an “AI Manhattan Project”, a full frontal assault on common sense: the challenge is to create an Encyclopédia of Common sense&quot;, Michio Kaku citing Lenat.

<doc id="99993" wikidata="Q256294" url="?curid=99993" title="Bertrand Delanoë">
<text>Bertrand Delanoë (; born 30 May 1950) is a French retired politician who served as Mayor of Paris from 2001 to 2014. A member of the Socialist Party (PS), he previously served in the National Assembly from 1981 to 1986 and Senate from 1995 until 2001.

==Early life and education==
Delanoë was born 30 May 1950 in Tunis, at that time a protectorate of the French colonial empire, to a French mother and a French-Tunisian father. His father, a land surveyor, was atheist while his mother, a nurse, was Roman Catholic.

At 6 years old, Delanoë became a member of the &quot;Petits Chanteurs des Sables&quot;, a Christian choral group associated with the Petits Chanteurs à la Croix de Bois. At the age of 11, Delanoë witnessed the crisis of Bizerte between France and newly independent Tunisia. Bertrand Delanoë moved back to France with his family following Tunisian independence; after the military base in Bizerte was closed in 1963, Delanoë&#x27;s family broke up. His mother came to live in Rodez, Aveyron with her son. After leaving school, Delanoë is said to have started studies in law at the University of Toulouse. According to &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in France&quot; he has a diploma in economics.

== Career ==
===Early political career ===
Delanoë has been involved in politics since the age of twenty-three as the secretary of the Socialist federation in Aveyron.

He was first elected to the Council of Paris in 1977. In 1993, he became the head of the city&#x27;s Socialist Party branch. In 1995, he was elected to the Senate, where he was secretary of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.

=== Mayor of Paris ===
Delanoë became Mayor of Paris on 18 March 2001, when control of the Council of Paris was won by a left-wing alliance for the first time since 1977 (election with universal suffrage). His predecessors were Jean Tiberi (1995–2001) and Jacques Chirac (1977–1995), who resigned after 18 years as mayor when he was elected President of the French Republic.

Delanoë won the mayorship of Paris at the head of a coalition of Socialists, Greens and Communists, over the conservative candidates Jean Tiberi and Philippe Séguin, who were unable to resolve their differences and thereby split the conservative vote. This success in a city which had traditionally been a stronghold of the right until the end of the 20th century was made all the more striking by setbacks to the left in the 2001 municipal elections that occurred more generally. It has been partially attributed with the weariness of the Parisian public with respect to various scandals of corruption and graft in the preceding administrations.

Delanoë was virtually unknown before the election of 2001, but soon gained fame for organising new and unusual events in Paris, such as the &quot;Paris Beach&quot; (&quot;Paris-Plages&quot;) on the banks of the Seine every summer in order to give Parisians who could not take a regular vacation a chance to relax, sunbathe and build sandcastles in the center of Paris. The program, especially popular with families with children, has been in place since 2002, and has since been copied by many other international cities.

As mayor, Delanoë&#x27;s goals were to improve the quality of life, reduce pollution, and cut down on vehicle traffic within the city (including a plan for a non-polluting tramway to ease Parisian traffic) and pedestrian malls. He helped introduce a program called Vélib&#x27; (a portmanteau of &quot;vélo&quot; and &quot;libre&quot; meaning &quot;free bicycles&quot;) which gave Parisians access to inexpensive rental bicycles available in stations all around Paris. The program has been enormously successful despite the fact that it still has a few logistical problems to be worked out. He outlined a plan for an autolib, whereby small cars would be shared. He was reelected in 2008 (57.7%) for a new six-year-term (2008–2014).

Ahead of the Socialist Party&#x27;s 2008 convention in Reims, Delanoë publicly endorsed Martine Aubry as candidate to succeed François Hollande at the party&#x27;s leadership.

In 2009, Delanoë criticized statements by Pope Benedict XVI about how condom use was unhelpful or even counter-productive in the fight against AIDS.

Ahead of the Socialist Party&#x27;s 2012 convention in Toulouse, Delanoë endorsed Harlem Désir as candidate to succeed Aubry at the party&#x27;s leadership.

====Assassination attempt====
Delanoë was stabbed on 5 October 2002 during the &quot;Nuit Blanche&quot;, a night of festivities in Paris, while mingling with the public. His assailant was a Muslim immigrant, Azedine Berkane, who reportedly told police that &quot;he hated politicians, the Socialist Party, and homosexuals.&quot; Before being taken to hospital, Delanoë ordered that the festivities continue. Delanoë&#x27;s wound was not life-threatening and he left the hospital after about two weeks.

Azedine Berkane was eventually permitted to leave the psychiatric hospital where he had been a patient after his doctors no longer considered him a threat. However, in early April 2007, he failed to keep a scheduled appointment with his doctors. Paris police recaptured him on May 22. He was returned to the psychiatric facility and placed into a high-security unit.

====Olympic bid====
The failure to secure the 2012 Summer Olympics for Paris on 6 July 2005 was Delanoë&#x27;s first major setback as mayor. In the aftermath of the defeat in his Olympic bid, he accused British prime minister Tony Blair of unduly influencing the result in order to secure the games in London. However, Delanoë&#x27;s popularity in fact rose during July 2005. The French public appeared to have laid more of the blame on President Jacques Chirac, who allegedly said that &quot;the only worse food than British food is Finnish&quot; which is widely believed to have offended two Finnish members of the International Olympic Committee.

===Potential presidential bid===
Delanoë was said to be considering challenging then-current president Sarkozy in the Presidential election in 2012. However, this plan suffered a setback in November 2008 when he lost the race for the party leadership to Lille mayor Martine Aubry.

===Fake &quot;The New York Times&quot; letter===
On 22 December 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a letter attributed to Delanoë criticizing Caroline Kennedy&#x27;s candidacy for the United States Senate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton. The newspaper later admitted that the letter, which had been sent by email, had not been properly verified, and was a fake.

==Personal life==
Delanoë was one of the first major French politicians to announce that he was gay, during a 1998 television interview (before being elected mayor). Although a long-time politician, Delanoë is visible at cultural affairs. He attends film festivals, and he is sometimes quoted in the media or appears on television to speak about his friendship with the late French superstar entertainer, Dalida.

<text>The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) is a charitable organisation registered in England and Wales and in Scotland. It was founded in 1889. It works to promote conservation and protection of birds and the wider environment through public awareness campaigns, petitions and through the operation of nature reserves throughout the United Kingdom.

In 2021/22 the RSPB had revenue of £157 million, 2,200 employees, 10,500 volunteers and 1.1 million members (including 195,000 youth members), making it one of the world&#x27;s largest wildlife conservation organisations. The RSPB has many local groups and maintains 222 nature reserves.

==History==
The origins of the RSPB lie with two groups of women, both formed in 1889:
* The Plumage League was founded by Emily Williamson at her house in Didsbury, Manchester, as a protest group campaigning against the use of great crested grebe and kittiwake skins and feathers in fur clothing. The house is now in Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden.
* The Fin, Fur and Feather Folk was founded in Croydon by Eliza Phillips, Etta Lemon, Catherine Hall, Hannah Poland and others.

The groups gained in popularity and amalgamated in 1891 to form the Society for the Protection of Birds in London. The Society gained its Royal Charter in 1904.

The original members of the SPB were all women who campaigned against the fashion of the time for women to wear exotic feathers in hats, and the consequent encouragement of &quot;plume hunting&quot;. To this end the Society had two simple rules:

At the time of founding, the trade in plumage for use in hats was very large: in the first quarter of 1884, almost 7,000 bird-of-paradise skins were being imported to Britain, along with 400,000 birds from West India and Brazil, and 360,000 birds from East India.

In 1890, the society published its first leaflet, entitled &quot;Destruction of Ornamental-Plumaged Birds&quot;, aimed at saving the egret population by informing wealthy women of the environmental damage wrought by the use of feathers in fashion. A later 1897 publication, &quot;Bird Food in Winter&quot;, aimed to address the use of berries as winter decoration and encouraged the use of synthetic berries to preserve the birds food source. In 1897 the SPB distributed over 16,000 letters and 50,000 leaflets and by 1898 had 20,000 members.

The Society attracted support from some women of high social standing who belonged to the social classes that popularised the wearing of feathered hats, including the Duchess of Portland (who became the Society&#x27;s first President) and the Ranee of Sarawak. As the organisation began to attract the support of many other influential figures, both male and female, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton, it gained in popularity and attracted many new members. The society received a Royal Charter in 1904 from Edward VII, just 15 years after its founding, and was instrumental in petitioning the Parliament of the United Kingdom to introduce laws banning the use of plumage in clothing.

At the time that the Society was founded in Britain, similar societies were also founded in other European countries. In 1961, the society acquired The Lodge in Sandy, Bedfordshire, as its new headquarters. The RSPB&#x27;s logo depicts an avocet. The first version was designed by Robert Gillmor.

==Activities==
Today, the RSPB works with both the civil service and the Government to advise Government policies on conservation and environmentalism. It is one of several organisations that determine the official conservation status list for all birds found in the UK.

The RSPB does not run bird hospitals nor offer animal rescue services.

The RSPB entered into a partnership with UK housebuilder Barratt Developments in 2014.

===Reserves===
The RSPB maintains over 200 reserves throughout the United Kingdom, covering a wide range of habitats, from estuaries and mudflats to forests and urban habitats. The reserves often have bird hides provided for birdwatchers and many provide visitor centres, which include information about the wildlife that can be seen there.

===Awards===
The RSPB confers awards, including the President&#x27;s Award, for volunteers who make a notable contribution to the work of the society.

====RSPB Medal====

According to the RSPB:

The RSPB Medal is the Society&#x27;s most prestigious award. It is presented to an individual in recognition of wild bird protection and countryside conservation. It is usually awarded annually to one or occasionally two people.

===Magazines===
The RSPB has published a members-only magazine for over a century.

====&quot;Bird Notes&quot;====


&quot;Bird Notes and News&quot; () was first published in April 1903.

The title changed to &quot;Bird Notes&quot; in 1947. In the 1950s, there were four copies per year (one for each season, published on the 1st of each third month, March, June, September and December). Each volume covered two years, spread over three calendar years. For example, volume XXV (25), number one was dated Winter 1951, and number eight in the same volume was dated Autumn 1953.

From the mid-1950s, many of the covers were by Charles Tunnicliffe. Two of the originals are on long-term loan to the Tunnicliffe gallery at Oriel Ynys Môn, but in 1995 the RSPB sold 114 at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction, raising £210,000, the most expensive being a picture of a partridge which sold for £6,440.

From January 1964 (vol. 31, no. 1), publication increased to six per year, (issued in the odd-numbered months, January, March and so on, but dated &quot;January–February&quot;, &quot;March–April&quot;, etc.). Volumes again covered two years, so vol. 30, covering 1962–63, therefore included nine issues, ending with the &quot;Winter 1963–64&quot; edition instead of eight. The final edition, vol. 31 no. 12, was published in late 1965.

=====Editors=====

* Miss M. G. Davies, BA, MBOU (for many years, until vol. 30 no. 9)
* John Clegg (from vol. 31 No. 1 – vol. 31 no. 3)
* Jeremy Boswell (from vol. 31 no. 4 – vol. 31 no. 12)

====&quot;Birds&quot;====
&quot;Bird Notes&quot;&#x27; successor &quot;Birds&quot; () replaced it immediately, with volume 1, number 1 being the January–February 1966 edition. Issues were published quarterly, numbered so that a new volume started every other year.

The Autumn 2013 edition, dated August–October 2013, being vol. 25 no. 7, was the last.

==== &quot;Nature&#x27;s Home&quot; ====
In Winter 2013 &quot;Birds&quot; was replaced by a new magazine, &quot;Nature&#x27;s Home&quot;. The editor was Mark Ward. The magazine had an ABC-certified circulation of 600,885.

==== &quot;The RSPB Magazine&quot; ====

With the Summer/Autumn 2022 issue, the magazine has been re-titled.

===Junior divisions===
The RSPB has two separate groups for children and teenagers: Wildlife Explorers (founded in 1943 as the Junior Bird Recorders&#x27; Club; from 1965 to 2000 the Young Ornithologists&#x27; Club or YOC) and RSPB Phoenix. Wildlife Explorers is targeted at children aged between 8 and 12, although it also has some younger members, and has two different magazines: &quot;Wild Times&quot; for 0–7-year-olds, and &quot;Wild Explorer&quot; for 8–12-year-olds. RSPB Phoenix is aimed at teenagers, and produces &quot;Wingbeat&quot; magazine, which is primarily written by young people for young people. The RSPB is a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services.

===Big Garden Birdwatch===
RSPB organises bird record data collection in annual collective birdwatching days in Britain. The RSPB describes this as the &quot;world&#x27;s biggest wildlife survey&quot; and helps inform conservationists to gain a better knowledge on bird population trends in gardens in Britain. The Big Garden Birdwatch was launched as a children&#x27;s activity in 1979, but from 2001 it encouraged adults to partake as well. In 2011, over 600,000 people took part, only 37% of whom were RSPB members. This event usually takes place in the last weekend of January. From the start of this annual survey records for house sparrows showed a decline of 60%, while starling populations declined by about 80% from 1979 to 2012.

In 2022, nearly 700,000 people took part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, counting more than 11 billion birds.

=== BirdTrack ===
BirdTrack is an online citizen science website, operated by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) on behalf of a partnership of the BTO, the RSPB, BirdWatch Ireland, the Scottish Ornithologists&#x27; Club and the Welsh Ornithological Society ().

==Finances==

The RSPB is funded primarily by its members; in 2006, over 50% of the society&#x27;s £88 million income came from subscriptions, donations and legacies, worth a total of £53.669 million. As a registered charity, the organisation is entitled to gift aid worth an extra £0.25 on every £1.00 donated by income tax payers. The bulk of the income (£63.757 million in 2006) is spent on conservation projects, maintenance of the reserves and on education projects, with the rest going on fundraising efforts and reducing the pension deficit, worth £19.8 million in 2006.

== Advertising ==
It was reported in an article in &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; on 2 November 2014 that claims that the charity &quot;was spending 90 per cent of its income on conservation&quot; by the UK Advertising Standards Authority were incorrect. The article claimed that the true figure was closer to 26%. The Charity Commission investigated the claims, and contacted the RSPB to get it to clarify its web statement. The RSPB complied, with the clarification that 90% of its net income (after expenses, not gross income as received) was spent on conservation, and that conservation activities were diverse, not limited to spending on its own nature reserves. This was accepted by the Charity Commission.

<text>The Halvergate Marshes are an area of grazing marsh in the east of the English county of Norfolk. They form part of the area of The Broads and lie between the River Bure and the River Yare, bordering Breydon Water on the east. The marshes cover an area of around . An area of is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Some areas are also in the Breydon Water Local Nature Reserve, the Broadland and Breydon Water Ramsar sites, The Broads Special Area of Conservation, and The Broads and Breydon Water Special Protection Areas.

==History==
Halvergate Marshes were an estuary in Roman times and remained a tidal creek into the Medieval period. By the time of Domesday Book the land was already being used for grazing sheep, with Halvergate being recorded as having 960 sheep at the time, a larger amount than any other part of the marshes. Some evidence of possible salt workings also remains. Around 400 years ago the land was drained and converted to grazing marsh using a series of windpumps or windmills and drainage ditches. It was used mainly to graze sheep and cattle, although was occasionally farmed as arable land until coastal flooding in the 1780s.

Arable ploughing in the 1960s and 70s damaged the ditch landscape and ecology and in the 1980s further draining was undertaken. This led to the loss of wildlife habitat and in 1981 an area in size was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. In 1985 the Broads Authority, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Countryside Commission developed the Broads Grazing Marsh Conservation Scheme, a series of financial incentives to persuade farmers to adopt more environmentally friendly methods on Halvergate Marshes. This led to the creation of the UK&#x27;s first Environmentally Sensitive Area on Halvergate Marshes in 1987 and was the prototype for ESAs nationally.

The marshes are dotted with windpumps, many without sails or even caps. These structures were used for draining the marshes before the introduction of motor or diesel pumps. Among the best preserved are Stracey Arms Mill on the River Bure, Lockgate Mill, Mutton&#x27;s Mill and the Berney Arms Windmill, a Scheduled Ancient Monument on the River Yare.

==Geography==
Halvergate Marshes is the largest area of traditionally managed grazing marsh in the Broadland area. The area is extremely flat and low lying with much of the area at or below sea level. Breydon Water forms the eastern edge of the marshes with the River Yare dividing the area from similar areas of marshland to the south. The villages of Reedham, Wickhampton and Halvergate and the higher ground they occupy forms the western edge of the marshes, with the market town of Acle at the extreme north-west. The River Bure and the Acle Straight road form the northern edge. The area of the Site of Special Scientific Interest forms part of the wider marshland area and is mainly located to the south of the Halvergate Fleet waterway and the village of Halvergate. Areas of marshland extend outside of the Halvergate Marshes both to the north and the south.

The area is sparsely populated with a scattering of isolated farms across the marshes, although it may have been more populated in the Medieval period. Berney Arms is the site of Berney Arms railway station, one of the most isolated railway stations in England, and at one point had up to 11 inhabited houses. The RSPB Berney Marshes reserve forms part of the area. The area is crossed by the Weavers&#x27; Way and Wherryman&#x27;s Way footpaths.
==Flora and fauna==
Halvergate Marshes support a range of habitats besides grazing marsh, including areas of unimproved pasture, wet fen meadow, reed bed and alder carr. A band of woodland lies along the western edge of the marshes. The drainage ditches which cross the marshes are deemed to be of &quot;outstanding importance for nature conservation&quot; and support a range of freshwater and brackish communities of plants and invertebrates.

Freshwater ditch communities, which lie mainly along the western side of the SSSI area, are recognised as being of &quot;being of international importance&quot; and support species such as broad-leaved pondweed &quot;Potamogeton natans&quot;, water violet &quot;Hottonia palustris&quot; and the nationally scarce whorled water milfoil &quot;Myriophyllum verticillatum&quot;. Other areas of ditches support species such as the nationally scarce water soldier &quot;Stratiotes alludes&quot;, fen pondweed &quot;Potamogeton coloratus&quot;, hairlike pondweed &quot;Potamogeton trichoides&quot; and water parsnip &quot;Sium latifolium&quot;. The area of ditch close to Breydon Water are more brackish in nature and feature species such as soft hornwort &quot;Ceratophyllum submersum&quot; and the nationally scarce stiff saltmarsh grass &quot;Puccinellia rupestris&quot;.

Invertebrate species associated with the drainage ditches include the nationally rare species Norfolk hawker dragonfly &quot;Aeshna isosceles&quot;, the great silver water-beetle &quot;Hydrophilus piceus&quot; and a large hoverfly &quot;Lejops vittatus&quot;.

Birds typically found on Halvergate Marshes include both wintering species such as Bewick&#x27;s swan, golden plover and lapwing as well as breeding species such as ruff, gadwall and shoveler. The Bewick&#x27;s swan population is considered to be internationally important. The marshes and nearby Breydon Water are an important migration point for a range of bird species in the autumn.

==Management==
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds takes a leading role in management on the marshes, working alongside other environmental bodies such as Natural England, Norfolk Wildlife Trust and the Broads Authority. Farmers work in collaboration with environmental management agencies, for example to reinstate drainage ditches and dykes to support biodiversity on the marshes.

<text>Berney Marshes and Breydon Water RSPB reserve is a nature reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). Berney Marshes is situated south of the River Bure while Breydon water is the combined estuary of the River Waveney and the River Yare inland from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, England.

Berney Marshes is part of the larger area of the Halvergate Marshes. The Berney Marshes and Breydon Water habitats are being managed by the RSPB to benefit all of the wildlife in the area but in particular the breeding and wintering birds. The area managed by the RSPB extends to of improved wet grassland and in winter the total numbers of wildfowl and waders can reach 85,000. Species the reserve is important for include pink-footed goose, Eurasian wigeon and black-tailed godwit. The water levels are kept high into the Spring so that the grasslands are in a good condition for breeding common redshank and Northern lapwing, this being helped by the grazing of cattle which helps to make the grassland sward more suitable for breeding waders. The ditches are amanged on a 7-10 year cycle to optimise the diversity of insects and other aquatic invertebrates within them. In addition, the RSPB manage of intertidal mud flats as a sanctuary for the wintering birds.

The reserve cannot be accessed by car, it can be reached by foot from Great Yarmouth or by taking a train from either Norwich or Great Yarmouth and requesting it to stopat Berney Arms Station.

<text>Breydon Water is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England. It is a Local Nature Reserve, a Ramsar site and a Special Protection Area. It is part of the Berney Marshes and Breydon Water nature reserve, which is managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).

It is a large stretch of sheltered estuary. It is at the gateway to The Broads river system on the eastern edge of Halvergate Marshes. It is the UK&#x27;s largest protected wetland. It is long and more than wide in places.

Breydon Water is overlooked at the southern end by the remains of the Roman Saxon Shore fort at Burgh Castle. Centuries ago, Breydon Water would have been one large estuary facing the sea. At the western end the water may be considered to start at the confluence of the River Yare and River Waveney; smaller sources including The Fleet flow in from the surrounding marshland. Safe passage for boats is indicated by red and green marker posts. Unlike most of the navigable waterways in the Norfolk Broads, Breydon Water is not subject to a speed limit.

At the east end of Breydon Water the river returns to a narrow channel, passing under Breydon Bridge after which it is joined by the River Bure then under Haven Bridge and Herring Bridge from where it is through the harbour into the North Sea.

At low tide there are vast areas of mudflats and saltings, all teeming with birds. Since the mid-80s, Breydon Water has been a nature reserve in the care of the RSPB. It has been a popular shooting area for centuries, and the shooting continues, but on a very much reduced scale.

In the winter, large numbers of wading birds and wildfowl use it to overwinter, including 12,000 golden plovers, 12,000 wigeons, 32,000 lapwings and tens of thousands of Bewick&#x27;s swans. Other species that have been noted there include dunlin, sanderling, Eurasian whimbrel, several (escaped) flamingos, pied avocets and on one occasion a glossy ibis.

There is a bird observation hide at the east end of Breydon Water, on the north shore, looking out towards a breeding platform used mainly by common terns. Other breeding species include common shelducks, northern shovelers, Eurasian oystercatchers and yellow wagtails.

Naturalist Arthur Henry Patterson (1857–1935), who published under the pseudonym &quot;John Knowlittle&quot;, extensively documented the wildlife of Breydon and the disappearing lifestyles of the boatmen, wildfowlers and fishermen who made a living from the estuary.

Short sections of the Wherryman&#x27;s Way and Weavers&#x27; Way long-distance paths follow the northern bank of the estuary from Yarmouth to Berney Arms, a distance of about 5 miles. Breydon Water is the site of events in Arthur Ransome&#x27;s popular &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; series book, &quot;Coot Club&quot;.

<text>Berney Arms is a settlement on the north bank of the River Yare, close to Breydon Water in the English county of Norfolk. It is part of the civil parish of Reedham, in the district of Broadland, and lies within The Broads. It comprises a railway station, a windmill, a farmhouse and a pub which closed in late 2015 (though permission for conversion to a dwelling was refused; campaigners are seeking to reopen it as a pub). In 2020, an adjacent property opened as a bistro. The area is not accessible by public road.

==History==
Berney Arms takes its name from the Berney Arms public house, which is by the staithe on the north bank of the River Yare and which served walkers and boaters passing through the area. It was closed in 2015 and the owner proposed to turn the pub into a private house, but planning permission was refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;BA/2015/0176/FUL&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The public house was named after the landowner Thomas Trench Berney who owned the Reedham Cement Works centred on the Berney Arms Windmill. The mill was built in 1865 and is the tallest windmill in Norfolk at tall. It was used to grind cement clinker and was later converted into a drainage mill. It closed in 1948 and is now a Scheduled Monument in the care of English Heritage. At one point the mill supported a small settlement of 11 domestic dwellings and a chapel. Berney sold the land on which the railway was built, on the condition that a stopping place was built to serve the settlement in perpetuity.

==Geography==
Berney Arms is in an area of marshland, much of which is at or below sea level. It lies on the River Yare just to the west of Breydon Water. The area is part of Berney Marshes RSPB reserve and within the Halvergate Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest. These provide important habitats for a range of plant and invertebrate species as well as providing important wintering grounds for bird species such as Bewick&#x27;s swan. 

The area is also a Ramsar Site and part of the Broadland Special Protection Area. Ashtree Farm is used by the RSPB as a series of dwellings and as its base for the marshes.

==Transport==
Berney Arms can be reached only by train, by boat or on foot; it has no public road access, with only a private track running to it. 

Berney Arms railway station is a request stop on the Wherry Lines between and , via . Greater Anglia operate a limited number of services each day, with more frequent trains on Sundays. In 2019, it was the least-used station in Britain. 

The settlement is on both the Weavers&#x27; Way and Wherryman&#x27;s Way footpaths.

==In popular culture==
Berney Arms was mentioned in Arthur Ransome&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Coot Club&quot;, which is in the &quot;Swallows and Amazon&quot; series.

In 1960, BBC reporter Fyfe Robertson made a short black and white documentary covering Berney Arms station and interviewed two residents.

<text>Grebes () are aquatic diving birds in the order Podicipediformes (). Grebes are widely distributed freshwater birds, with some species also found in marine habitats during migration and winter. Most grebes fly, although some flightless species exist, most notably in stable lakes. The order contains a single family, the Podicipedidae, which includes 22 species in six extant genera. 

Although, superficially, they resemble other diving birds such as loons and coots, they are most closely related to flamingos, as supported by morphological, molecular and paleontological data. Many species are monogamous and are known for their courtship displays, with the pair performing synchronized dances across the water&#x27;s surface. The birds build floating vegetative nests where they lay several eggs. About a third of the world&#x27;s grebes are listed at various levels of conservation concerns—the biggest threats including habitat loss, the introduction of invasive predatory fish and human poaching. As such, three species have gone extinct.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;grebe&quot; comes from the French , which is of unknown origin and dating to 1766. It is possibly from the Breton &quot;krib&quot; meaning &#x27;comb&#x27;, this referring to the crests of many of the European species. However, was used to refer to gulls. The appearance of &quot;grebe&quot; in the English language was introduced in 1768 by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant when he adopted the word for the family. Some of the smaller species are often referred to as &quot;dabchick&quot;, which originated in the mid 16th century English as they were said to be chick-like birds that dive. The clade names &quot;Podicipediformes&quot; and &quot;Podicipedidae&quot; is based on the genus &quot;Podiceps&quot; which is a combination of Latin of , gen. (&quot;rear-end&quot; or &quot;anus&quot;) and (&quot;foot&quot;), a reference to the placement of a grebe&#x27;s legs towards the rear of its body.

==Field characteristics==

Grebes are small to medium-large in size ranging from the least grebe (&quot;Tachybaptus dominicus&quot;), at and , to the great grebe (&quot;Podiceps major&quot;), at and . Despite these size differences grebes are a homogenous family of waterbirds with very few or slight differences among the genera.

===Anatomy and physiology===
On the surface of the water they swim low with just the head and neck exposed. All species have lobed toes, and are excellent swimmers and divers. The feet are always large, with broad lobes on the toes and small webs connecting the front three toes. The hind toe also has a small lobe as well. The claws are similar to nails and are flat. These lobate feet act as an oar, as when moving forward they provide minimum resistance and moving backwards they provide a coverage of maximum surface. 

The leg bones (femur and tarsometatarsus) are equal in length, with the femur having a large head and the presence of long cnemial crests in the tarsometatarsus. The patella is separate and supports the tarsometatarsus posteriorly which greatly helps with the contraction in the muscles. They swim by simultaneously spreading out the feet and bringing them inward, with the webbing expanded to produce the forward thrust in much the same way as frogs. However, due to the anatomy of the legs, grebes are not as mobile on land as they are on the water. Although they can run for a short distance, they are prone to falling over, since they have their feet placed far back on the body.

The wing shape varies depending on the species, ranging from moderately long to incredibly short and rounded in shape. The wing anatomy in grebes has a relatively short and thin carpometacarpus-phalanges component which supports their primary feathers, while the ulna is long and fairly weak, supporting secondary feathers. There are 11 primaries and 17 to 22 secondaries, with the inner secondaries being longer than the primaries. As such grebes are generally not strong or rapid fliers. Some species are reluctant to fly. Indeed, two South American species are completely flightless. Since grebes generally dive more than fly, the sternum can be as small or even smaller than the pelvic girdle. When they do fly, they often launch themselves off from the water and must run along the surface as they flap their wings to provide a lift.
Bills vary from short and thick to long and pointed depending on the diet, and are slightly larger in males than in females (though the sizes can overlap between younger males and females).

===Feathers===
Grebes have unusual plumage. On average grebes have 20,000 feathers, the highest among birds. The feathers are very dense and strongly curved. In the larger species feathers are more dense but shorter, while the opposite is true in smaller species where the feathers are longer but less dense. 

The density and length of feathers is correlated exponentially with heat-loss in cold water. For this reason grebes invest plumage maintenance the most in birds in terms of duration of time and energy. The uropygial glands secrete a high concentration of paraffin. The secretion provides a dual purpose of protecting the feathers from external parasites and fungi, as well as waterproofing them. When preening, grebes eat their own feathers and feed them to their young. The function of this behaviour is uncertain, but it is believed to assist with pellet formation, excreting out internal parasites and protecting their insides from sharp bone material during digestion. The ventral plumage is the most dense, described as very fur-like. By pressing their feathers against the body, grebes can adjust their buoyancy. In the nonbreeding season, grebes are plain-coloured in dark browns and whites. However, most have ornate and distinctive breeding plumages, often developing chestnut markings on the head area, and perform elaborate display rituals. The young, particularly those of the genus &quot;Podiceps&quot;, are often striped and retain some of their juvenile plumage even after reaching full size.

==Systematics==

The grebes are a radically distinct group of birds as regards their anatomy. Accordingly, they were at first believed to be related to the loons, which are also foot-propelled diving birds, and both families were once classified together under the order Colymbiformes. However, as early as the 1930s, this was determined to be an example of convergent evolution caused by the strong selective forces encountered by unrelated birds sharing the same lifestyle at different times and in different habitat. Grebes and loons are now separately classified orders of Podicipediformes and Gaviiformes, respectively.

Recent molecular studies have suggested a relation with flamingos, a finding that has been backed up by morphological evidence. They hold at least eleven morphological traits in common not found in other birds. For example, both flamingoes and grebes lay eggs coated with chalky amorphous calcium phosphate. Many of these characteristics have been previously identified in flamingos, but not in grebes. For the grebe-flamingo clade, the taxon Mirandornithes (&quot;miraculous birds&quot; due to their extreme divergence and apomorphies) has been proposed. Alternatively, they could be placed in one order, with Phoenocopteriformes taking priority.

===Fossil record===
The fossil record of grebes is incomplete as there are no transitional forms between more conventional birds and grebes known from fossils. The enigmatic waterbird genus &quot;Juncitarsus&quot;, however, may be close to a common ancestor of flamingos and grebes. The extinct stem-flamingo family Palaelodidae have been suggested to be the transitional linkage between the filter-feeding flamingos and the foot-propelled diving grebes. The evidence for this comes from the overall similarity between the foot and limb structure of grebes and palaeloids, suggesting the latter family of waterbirds were able to swim and dive better than flamingos. Some early grebes share similar characteristics to the coracoid and humerus seen in palaeloids.

True grebes suddenly appear in the fossil record in the Late Oligocene or Early Miocene, around 23–25 mya. There are a few prehistoric genera that are now completely extinct. &quot;Thiornis&quot; and &quot;Pliolymbus&quot; date from a time when most if not all extant genera were already present. Because grebes are evolutionarily isolated and they only started to appear in the Northern Hemisphere fossil record in the Early Miocene, they are likely to have originated in the Southern Hemisphere.

===Phylogeny===
To date there is no complete phylogeny of grebes based on molecular work. However, there are comprehensive morphological works from Bochenski (1994), Fjeldså (2004) and Ksepka &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) that have been done on the grebe genera.

==Natural history==
===Habitat, distribution and migration===
Grebes are a nearly cosmopolitan clade of waterbirds, found on every continent except Antarctica. They are absent from the Arctic Circle and arid environments. They have successfully colonized islands such as Madagascar and New Zealand. Some species such as the eared grebe (&quot;Podiceps nigricollis&quot;) and great crested grebe (&quot;P. cristatus&quot;) are found on multiple continents with regional subspecies or populations. A few species like the Junin grebe (&quot;P. taczanowskii&quot;) and the recently extinct Atitlán grebe (&quot;Podilymbus gigas&quot;) are lake endemics. During the warmer or breeding seasons, many species of grebes in the northern hemisphere reside in a variety of freshwater habitats like lakes and marshes. Once winter arrives many will migrate to marine environments along the coastlines. Grebes are most prevalent in the New World with almost half of the world&#x27;s species native there.

===Feeding ecology===
The feeding ecology of grebes is diverse. Larger species such as those in the genus &quot;Aechmophorus&quot; have spear-like bills to catch mid-depth fish while smaller species such as those in the genera &quot;Tachybaptus&quot; and &quot;Podilymbus&quot; tend to be short and stout with a preference for catching small aquatic invertebrates. The majority of grebes predate on aquatic invertebrates, with only a handful of large-bodied piscivores. The aforementioned &quot;Aechmophorus&quot; is the most piscivorous of the grebes. Closely related species that overlap in their range often avoid interspecific competition by having prey preferences and adaptations for it. In areas where there is just as a single species, they tend to have more generalized bills with more openness to different prey sources.
===Breeding and reproduction===
Grebes are perhaps best known for their elaborate courtship displays. Most species perform a duet together and many have their own synchronized rituals. Some, like those species in the genus &quot;Podiceps&quot; do a &quot;penguin dance&quot; where the male and female stand upright, breast posturing out and run along the water&#x27;s surface. A similar ritual in other species is the &quot;weed dance&quot; in which both partners hold pieces of aquatic vegetation in their bills and are positioned upright towards each other. There is also the &quot;weed rush&quot; in which partners swim towards each other, necks stretched out with weeds in their bill, and just before colliding position themselves upright and then swim in parallel.

In the smaller and basal genera like &quot;Tachybaptus&quot; and &quot;Podilymbus,&quot; there is incorporation of aquatic vegetation in their courtship, but it is not as elaborate as the more derived and larger species. It has been hypothesized that such courtship displays between mates originated from intraspecific aggression that evolved in a way that strengthened pair bonds. Once these courtship rituals are completed, both partners solicit copulation towards each other and mount on floating platforms of vegetation. Females lay two to seven eggs and incubation can last nearly a month. Chicks of the nest hatch asynchronously. Once the whole nest has hatched, the chicks begin to climb on one of their parent&#x27;s backs. Both parents take care of rearing their young, and the duration of care is longer than those of other waterfowl. This enables a greater survival rate for the chicks. One parent dives for food, while the other watches the young on the surface.

===Parasitology===
249 species of parasitic worms have been known to parasitize the intestinal region of grebes. The amabiliids are a family of cyclophyllid cestodes that are almost all grebe specialists. The life cycle of these tapeworms begins when eggs are passed through the feces, where they are picked by intermediate hosts, which include corixid bugs and the nymphs of Odonata. These aquatic insects are eventually be consumed by grebes, where the lifecycle begins again. Another grebe specialist family of internal parasites are the Dioecocestidae. Other families such as Echinostomatidae and Hymenolepididae also contain several cestode species that are grebe specialists.

The prominent external parasites of grebes are the lice of the clade Ischnocera. One genus of these lice, &quot;Aquanirmus,&quot; is the only one that is a grebe specialist. Another major group of parasites are the two mites of the families Rhinonyssidae and Ereynetidae; these infect the nasal passages of grebes. The rhinonyssids move slowly in the mucous membranes, drinking blood, while the ereynetids live on the surface. Various lineages of feather mites of the clade Analgoidea have evolved to occupy different sections of the feather. &quot;Theromyzon&quot; (&quot;duck leeches&quot;) tend to feed in the nasal cavities of waterbirds in general, including grebes.

==Conservation==

Thirty percent of the total extant species are considered to be threatened species by the IUCN. The handful of critically endangered and extinct species of grebe are lake endemics and nearly all of them are or were flightless. The three recently extinct species consist of the Alaotra grebe, the Atitlán grebe, and the Colombian grebe. These species went extinct due to anthropogenic changes, such as habitat loss, the introduction of invasive predatory fishes, and the use of fishing nets that tangled birds in the lakes they once existed in. Similar issues are befalling the Colombian grebe&#x27;s closest relatives, the Junin grebe and hooded grebe, along with climate change.

<text>Otago (, ; ) is a region of New Zealand located in the southern half of the South Island administered by the Otago Regional Council. It has an area of approximately , making it the country&#x27;s second largest local government region. Its population was 

The name &quot;Otago&quot; is the local southern Māori dialect pronunciation of &quot;Ōtākou&quot;, the name of the Māori village near the entrance to Otago Harbour. The exact meaning of the term is disputed, with common translations being &quot;isolated village&quot; and &quot;place of red earth&quot;, the latter referring to the reddish-ochre clay which is common in the area around Dunedin. &quot;Otago&quot; is also the old name of the European settlement on the harbour, established by the Weller Brothers in 1831, which lies close to Otakou. The upper harbour later became the focus of the Otago Association, an offshoot of the Free Church of Scotland, notable for its adoption of the principle that ordinary people, not the landowner, should choose the ministers.

Major centres include Dunedin (the principal city), Oamaru, Balclutha, Alexandra, and the major tourist centres Queenstown and Wānaka. Kaitangata in South Otago is a prominent source of coal. The Waitaki and Clutha rivers provide much of the country&#x27;s hydroelectric power. Vineyards and wineries have been developed in the Central Otago wine region. Some parts of the area originally covered by Otago Province are now administered by either Canterbury Regional Council or Southland Regional Council.

==History==

Like the rest of mainland New Zealand, Otago was first settled by the Māori people. Most of the Māori settlement in Otago was upon the coast and centred around the Otago Peninsula. The Otago settlement, an outgrowth of the Free Church of Scotland, was founded in March 1848 with the arrival of the first two immigrant ships from Greenock on the Firth of Clyde — the &quot;John Wickliffe&quot; and the &quot;Philip Laing&quot;. Captain William Cargill, a veteran of the Peninsular War, was the secular leader. Otago citizens subsequently elected him to the office of provincial Superintendent after the New Zealand provinces were created in 1853.

The Otago Province was the whole of New Zealand from the Waitaki River south, including Stewart Island and the sub-Antarctic islands. It included the territory of the later Southland Province and also the much more extensive lands of the modern Southland Region.

Initial settlement was concentrated on the port and city, then expanded, notably to the south-west, where the fertile Taieri Plains offered good farmland. The 1860s saw rapid commercial expansion after Gabriel Read discovered gold at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully near Lawrence, and the Otago gold rush ensued.

Veterans of goldfields in California and Australia, plus many other fortune-seekers from Europe, North America and China, poured into the then Province of Otago, eroding its Scottish Presbyterian character. Further gold discoveries at Clyde and on the Arrow River around Arrowtown led to a boom, and Otago became for a period the cultural and economic centre of New Zealand. New Zealand&#x27;s first daily newspaper, the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot;, originally edited by Julius Vogel, dates from this period.
New Zealand&#x27;s first university, the University of Otago, was founded in 1869 as the provincial university in Dunedin.

The Province of Southland separated from Otago Province and set up its own Provincial Council at Invercargill in 1861. After difficulties ensued, Otago re-absorbed it in 1870. Its territory is included in the southern region of the old Otago Province which is named after it and is now the territory of the Southland region. The provincial governments were abolished in 1876 when the Abolition of the Provinces Act came into force on 1 November 1876, and were replaced by other forms of local authority, including counties. Two in Otago were named after the Scottish independence heroes Wallace and Bruce. From this time the national limelight gradually shifted northwards.

Otago&#x27;s flag was chosen from a 2004 competition. It was designed by Gregor Macauly.

==Geography==

Beginning in the west, the geography of Otago consists of high alpine mountains. The highest peak in Otago (and highest outside the Aoraki / Mount Cook area) is Mount Aspiring / Tititea, which is on the Main Divide. From the high mountains the rivers discharge into large glacial lakes. In this part of Otago glacial activity – both recent and very old – dominates the landscape, with large U-shaped valleys and rivers which have high sediment loads. River flows also vary dramatically, with large flood flows occurring after heavy rain. Lakes Wakatipu, Wānaka, and Hāwea form the sources of the Clutha River / Mata-Au, the largest river (by discharge) in New Zealand. The Clutha flows generally to the southeast through Otago and discharges near Balclutha. The river has been used for hydroelectric power generation, with large dams at Clyde and Roxburgh. The traditional northern boundary of the region, the Waitaki River, is also heavily utilised for hydroelectricity, though the region&#x27;s current official boundaries put much of that river&#x27;s catchment in Canterbury.
The country&#x27;s fourth-longest river, the Taieri, also has both its source and outflow in Otago, rising from rough hill country and following a broad horseshoe-shaped path, north, then east, and finally southeast, before reaching the Pacific Ocean. Along its course it forms two notable geographic features – the broad high valley of the Strath-Taieri in its upper reaches, and the fertile Taieri Plains as it approaches the ocean.

Travelling east from the mountains, the Central Otago drylands predominate. These are Canterbury–Otago tussock grasslands dominated by the block mountains, upthrust schist mountains. In contrast to Canterbury, where the Northwest winds blow across the plains without interruption, in Otago the block mountains impede and dilute the effects of the Nor&#x27;wester.

The main Central Otago centres, such as Alexandra and Cromwell, are found in the intermontane basins between the block mountains. The schist bedrock influence extends to the eastern part of Otago, where remnant volcanics mark its edge. The remains of the most spectacular of these are the Miocene volcanics centred on Otago Harbour. Elsewhere, basalt outcrops can be found along the coast and at other sites.

Comparatively similar terrain exists in the high plateau land of the Maniototo Plain, which lies to the east of Central Otago, close to the upper reaches of the Taieri River. This area is sparsely populated, but of historical note for its importance during the Otago gold rush of the 1860s. The townships of Ranfurly and Naseby also lie in this area.

In the southeastern corner of Otago lies The Catlins, an area of rough hill country which geologically forms part of the Murihiku terrane, an accretion which extends inland through the Hokonui Hills in the Southland region. This itself forms part of a larger system known as the Southland Syncline, which links to similar formations in Nelson (offset by the Alpine Fault) and even in New Caledonia, away.

The Catlins ranges are strike ridges composed of Triassic and Jurassic sandstones, mudstones and other related sedimentary rocks, often with a high incidence of feldspar. Fossils of the late and middle Triassic Warepan and Kaihikuan stages are found in the area.

==Climate==
Weather conditions vary enormously across Otago, but can be broken into two broad types: the coastal climate of the coastal regions and the more continental climate of the interior.

Coastal regions of Otago are subject to the alternating warm and dry/cool and wet weather patterns common to the interannual Southern oscillation. The Southern Hemisphere storm track produces an irregular short cycle of weather which repeats roughly every week, with three or four days of fine weather followed by three or four days of cooler, damp conditions. Drier conditions are often the result of the northwesterly föhn wind, which dries as it crosses the Southern Alps. Wetter air is the result of approaching low-pressure systems which sweep fronts over the country from the southwest. A common variant in this pattern is the centring of a stationary low-pressure zone to the southeast of the country, resulting in long-lasting cool, wet conditions. These have been responsible for several notable historical floods, such as the &quot;hundred year floods&quot; of October 1878 and October 1978.

Typically, winters are cool and wet in the extreme south areas and snow can fall and settle to sea level in winter, especially in the hills and plains of South Otago. More Central and Northern Coastal areas winter is sunnier and drier. Summers, by contrast, tend to be warm and dry, with temperatures often reaching the high 20s and low 30s Celsius.

In Central Otago cold frosty winters are succeeded by hot dry summers. Central Otago&#x27;s climate is the closest approximation to a continental climate anywhere in New Zealand. This climate is part of the reason why Central Otago vineyards are successful in this region. This inland region is one of the driest regions in the country, sheltered from prevailing rain-bearing weather conditions by the high mountains to the west and hills of the south. Summers can be hot, with temperatures often approaching or exceeding 30 degrees Celsius; winters, by contrast, are often bitterly cold – the township of Ranfurly in Central Otago holds the New Zealand record for lowest temperature with a reading of −25.6 °C on 18 July 1903.

==Population==
Otago Region covers . The population is as of which is approximately percent of New Zealand&#x27;s total population of million. The population density is people per km2. About percent of the population resides in the Dunedin urban area—the region&#x27;s main city and the country&#x27;s sixth largest urban area. For historical and geographical reasons, Dunedin is usually regarded as one of New Zealand&#x27;s four main centres. Unlike other southern centres, Dunedin&#x27;s population has not declined since the 1970s, largely due to the presence of the University of Otago – and especially its medical school – which attracts students from all over New Zealand and overseas.

Other significant urban centres in Otago with populations over 1,000 include: Queenstown, Oamaru, Wānaka, Port Chalmers, Cromwell, Alexandra, Balclutha, Milton and Mosgiel. Between 1996 and 2006, the population of the Queenstown-Lakes District grew by 60% due to the region&#x27;s booming tourism industry.

Otago had a population of 240,900 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 15,714 people (7.0%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 38,430 people (19.0%) since the 2013 census. There were 118,524 males, 121,185 females and 1,188 people of other genders in 94,425 dwellings. 4.3% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 38.4 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 37,749 people (15.7%) aged under 15 years, 53,532 (22.2%) aged 15 to 29, 106,926 (44.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 42,690 (17.7%) aged 65 or older.
People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 85.2% European (Pākehā); 9.9% Māori; 3.4% Pasifika; 8.5% Asian; 2.2% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.7% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 97.5%, Māori language by 1.9%, Samoan by 0.6% and other languages by 11.9%. No language could be spoken by 1.7% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.5%. The percentage of people born overseas was 23.8, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 28.4% Christian, 1.0% Hindu, 0.8% Islam, 0.2% Māori religious beliefs, 0.7% Buddhist, 0.5% New Age, 0.1% Jewish, and 1.4% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 60.3%, and 6.6% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 40,458 (19.9%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 106,080 (52.2%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 43,974 (21.6%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $39,100, compared with $41,500 nationally. 19,692 people (9.7%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 101,514 (50.0%) people were employed full-time, 31,086 (15.3%) were part-time, and 4,848 (2.4%) were unemployed.

The majority of the population of European lineage is of Scottish stock—the descendants of early Scottish settlers from the early 19th century. Other well-represented European groups include those of English, Irish, and Dutch descent. A large proportion of the Māori population are from the Ngāi Tahu iwi or tribe. Other significant ethnic minorities include Asians, Pacific Islanders, Africans, Latin Americans and Middle Easterners. Otago&#x27;s early waves of settlement, especially during and immediately after the gold rush of the 1860s, included a substantial minority of southern (Guangdong) Chinese settlers, and a smaller but also prominent number of people from Lebanon. The region&#x27;s Jewish population also experienced a small influx at this time. The early and middle years of the twentieth century saw smaller influxes of immigrants from several mainland European countries, most notably the Netherlands.

In line with the region&#x27;s Scottish heritage, Presbyterianism is the largest Christian denomination with 17.1 percent affiliating, while Catholicism is the second-largest denomination with 11.5 percent affiliating.

==Politics==
===Local government===
The seat of the Otago Regional Council is in Dunedin. The council is chaired by Andrew Noone .

There are five territorial authorities in Otago:
* Queenstown-Lakes District
* Central Otago District
* Dunedin City
* Clutha District
* Waitaki District

===Parliamentary representation===
Otago is represented by four parliamentary electorates. Dunedin and nearby towns are represented by the Dunedin electorate, held by Rachel Brooking, and the Taieri electorate, occupied by Ingrid Leary. Both MPs are members of the Labour Party, and Dunedin has traditionally been a Labour stronghold. Since 2008 the rest of Otago has been divided between the large rural electorates of Waitaki, which also includes some of the neighbouring Canterbury Region, and Clutha-Southland, which also includes most of the rural part of the neighbouring Southland Region. The Waitaki electorate has traditionally been a National Party stronghold and is currently held by Miles Anderson. The Southland electorate, also a National Party stronghold, is currently represented by Joseph Mooney. The earlier Otago electorate existed from 1978 to 2008, when it was split and merged into Waitaki and Clutha-Southland.

Two list MPs are based in Dunedin – Michael Woodhouse of the National Party and Rachel Brooking of the Labour Party. One-time Labour Party Deputy Leader David Parker is a former MP for the Otago electorate and currently a list MP.

Under the Māori electorates system, Otago is also part of the large Te Tai Tonga electorate, which covers the entire South Island and surrounding islands, and is currently held by Te Pāti Māori Party MP Tākuta Ferris.

=== Ngāi Tahu governance ===
Three of the 18 Ngāi Tahu Rūnanga (councils) are based in the Otago Region. Each one is centred on a coastal marae, namely Ōtākou, Moeraki and Puketeraki at Karitane. There is also the Arai Te Uru Marae in Dunedin.

==Economy==
The subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of Otago was estimated at NZ$14.18 billion in the year to March 2020, 4.38% of New Zealand&#x27;s national GDP. The regional GDP per capita was estimated at $58,353 in the same period. In the year to March 2018, primary industries contributed $1.25 billion (9.8%) to the regional GDP, goods-producing industries contributed $2.38 billion (18.6%), service industries contributed $8.05 billion (63.0%), and taxes and duties contributed $1.10 billion (8.6%).

Otago has a mixed economy. Dunedin is home to manufacturing, publishing and technology-based industries. Rural economies have been reinvigorated in the 1990s and 2000s: in Clutha district, farms have been converted from sheep to more lucrative dairying. Vineyard planting and production remained modest until the middle of the 1990s when the New Zealand wine industry began to expand rapidly. The Central Otago wine region produces wine made from varieties such as the Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Merlot and Riesling grapes. It has an increasing reputation as New Zealand&#x27;s leading Pinot noir region.

==Education==

Otago has numerous rural primary schools, several small town primary and secondary schools, and some larger schools in Dunedin. Most are state schools which do not charge tuition, except for international students. Some are state integrated schools, former private schools with a special character based on a religious or philosophical belief that has been integrated into the state system, but still charge &quot;attendance dues&quot; to cover the building and maintenance of school buildings. These schools are not owned by the government, but otherwise they like state schools cannot charge fees for tuition of domestic students but may request a donation. As Dunedin was founded by Presbyterian Scottish settlers there are a Presbyterian girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; school in the city. Unlike other major cities in New Zealand, Dunedin does not have any private intermediate or high schools, as all remaining private intermediate and high schools have been integrated into the state system.

<text>Marc Okrand (; born July 3, 1948) is an American linguist. His professional work is in Native American languages, and he is well known as the creator of the Klingon language in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction franchise.

==Career==
As a linguist, Okrand worked with Native American languages. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in linguistics from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1970. His 1977 doctoral dissertation from the University of California, Berkeley, was on the grammar of Mutsun, an extinct Ohlone language formerly spoken in the coastal areas of north-central California. His dissertation was supervised by pioneering linguist Mary Haas. From 1975 to 1978, he taught undergraduate linguistics courses at the University of California, Santa Barbara, before taking a post-doctoral fellowship at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., in 1978. 

After that, Okrand took a job at the National Captioning Institute, where he worked on the first closed-captioning system for hearing-impaired television viewers. Until his retirement in 2013, Okrand served as one of the directors for Live Captioning at the National Captioning Institute and as President of the board of directors of &quot;WSC Avant Bard&quot; (formerly the Washington Shakespeare Company) in Arlington County, Virginia, which planned to stage &quot;an evening of Shakespeare in Klingon&quot; in 2010.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
While coordinating closed captioning for the Oscars award show in 1982, Okrand met the producer for the movie &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. His first work was dubbing in Vulcan language dialogue for &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, since the actors had already been filmed talking in English. He was then hired by Paramount Pictures to develop the Klingon language and coach the actors using it in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. Okrand was later hired to create the Romulan and Vulcan dialogue for the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, but these lines were cut from the final release. He was also involved in &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, but only during post-production.

Okrand is the author of three books about Klingon – &quot;The Klingon Dictionary&quot; (first published 1985, revised enlarged edition 1992), &quot;The Klingon Way&quot; (1996), and &quot;Klingon for the Galactic Traveler&quot; (1997) – as well as two audio courses: &quot;Conversational Klingon&quot; (1992) and &quot;Power Klingon&quot; (1993). He has also co-authored the libretto of an opera in the Klingon language: &quot;&quot;, debuting at The Hague in September 2010. He speaks Klingon, but notes that others have attained greater fluency.

In 2018 he developed the language for the Kelpien race in the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; (first appearing in the third &quot;Short Treks&quot; episode &quot;The Brightest Star&quot;).

===&quot;Atlantis: The Lost Empire&quot;===
In 2001, Okrand created the Atlantean language for the Disney film &quot;.&quot; He was also used as an early facial model for the protagonist&#x27;s character design.

<text>Strumpshaw is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It is located on the northern bank of the River Yare around south-east of Norwich. The parish covers an area of and had a population of 602 in 245 households at the 2001 census, increasing to a population of 634 in 261 households at the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of Broadland.

The villages name means &#x27;stump wood&#x27;.

The village lies a little distance from the river, on the slopes of Strumpshaw Hill, the highest area of land in the Norfolk Broads. Because of its elevation, Strumpshaw hosted, from the late 1790s through to the mid-1810s, a repeater station in the shutter telegraph chain linking the Admiralty in London with Great Yarmouth. The Wherry Lines railway line running between Norwich and Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft runs through the parish. Trains call at Buckenham railway station at weekends only.

The small villages of Buckenham and Hassingham, formerly both parishes in their own right, lie within the civil parish of Strumpshaw.

==Strumpshaw Hall==
Strumpshaw Hall lies closer to the river, next to the railway line. It is the home of the Strumpshaw Hall Steam Museum, with a collection of traction engines and steam rollers. It also has a showman&#x27;s engine, a steam wagon and a narrow-gauge railway with a Simplex diesel disguised as a steam engine.

==Natural environment==
The Strumpshaw Fen RSPB reserve is operated by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It caters for up to 20,000 visitors annually. It is bordered to the east by Buckenham Marshes RSPB reserve and lies within the Mid-Yare National Nature Reserve and Yare Broads and Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==Rail Access==
The nearest station is Buckenham railway station on the Wherry Line.
