<text>Anansi or Ananse ( ; literally translates to &quot;spider&quot;) &lt;onlyinclude&gt; is an Akan folktale character associated with stories, wisdom, knowledge, and trickery, most commonly depicted as a spider, in Akan folklore. Taking the role of a trickster, he is also one of the most important characters of West African, African American and West Indian folklore. Originating in Ghana, these spider tales were spread to the Americas via the Atlantic slave trade. &lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Anansi is best known for his ability to outsmart and triumph over more powerful opponents through his use of cunning, creativity and wit. Despite taking on a trickster role, Anansi often takes centre stage in stories and is commonly portrayed as both the protagonist and antagonist.

==Origin==

Spider tales are found extensively throughout West Africa, but the Anansi tales from Ghana are seen to be the origin of these stories and are among the best-known, as Anansi&#x27;s name comes from the word in the Akan language for &quot;spider&quot;. They later spread to the West Indies, Suriname, Sierra Leone (where they were introduced by Jamaican Maroons) and the Netherlands Antilles; also Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire.

Anansi is depicted in many different ways and with different names, from &quot;Ananse&quot;, &quot;Kwaku Ananse&quot;, and &quot;Anancy&quot;, to his New World iterations, such as &quot;Ba Anansi&quot;, &quot;Kompa Nanzi&quot; and/or &quot;Nanzi&quot;, &quot;Nancy&quot;, &quot;Aunt Nancy&quot;, and &quot;Sis&#x27; Nancy&quot;, even though he is always depicted as a male in his stories. While often depicted as an animal, Anansi has many representations, which include an anthropomorphic spider with a human face, or conversely, a human with spider-like features, such as eight legs. Anansi also has a family in several folktales involving him, consisting of his long-suffering wife Okonore Yaa – known in other regions as Aso, Crooky, or Shi Maria; Ntikuma, his firstborn son; Tikelenkelen, his big-headed son; Nankonhwea, his son with a spindly neck and spindly legs; finally, Afudohwedohwe, his pot-bellied son. Anansi also has a beautiful daughter named Anansewa in other tales, like those introduced in the work of Efua Sutherland: in Efua&#x27;s tale, he embarks on a mission to ensure that Anansewa can have an appropriate suitor.

It is said that Odomankoma (¿) is also known as Ananse Kokuroko (meaning Great Spider), who might be Ananse. But this could actually be chalked up to the two being relatives. It is said in some Akan myths that Ananse becomes the creator, so it could be either roles changing similar to Bobowissi becoming the God of Lightning after Tano Akora&#x27;s role is changed from the God of Lightning to the God of War after fighting with Owuo, or Odomankoma&#x27;s sunsum being reincarnated inside of Ananse after Owuo kills him, supported by how sunsum works (via the father).

==Social relevance==

Anansi stories were part of an exclusively oral tradition, and Anansi himself was seen as synonymous with skill and wisdom in speech. Stories of Anansi became such a prominent and familiar part of Ashanti oral culture that they eventually encompassed many kinds of fables, evidenced by the work of R.S. Rattray, who recorded many of these tales in both the English and Twi languages, as well as the work of scholar Peggy Appiah: &quot;So well known is he that he has given his name to the whole rich tradition of tales on which so many Ghanaian children are brought up – anansesem – or spider tales.&quot; In similar fashion, oral tradition is what introduced Anansi tales to the rest of the world, especially the Caribbean, via the people that were enslaved during the Atlantic slave trade. As a result, the importance of Anansi socially did not diminish when slaves were brought to the New World.

Instead, Anansi was often celebrated as a symbol of slave resistance and survival, because Anansi is able to turn the tables on his powerful oppressors by using his cunning and trickery, a model of behaviour used by slaves to gain the upper hand within the confines of the plantation power structure. Anansi is also believed to have played a multifunctional role in the slaves&#x27; lives; as well as inspiring strategies of resistance, the tales enabled enslaved Africans to establish a sense of continuity with their African past and offered them the means to transform and assert their identity within the boundaries of captivity. As historian Lawrence W. Levine argues in &quot;Black Culture and Consciousness&quot;, enslaved Africans in the New World devoted &quot;the structure and message of their tales to the compulsions and needs of their present situation&quot; (1977, 90).

The Jamaican versions of these stories are some of the best-preserved because Jamaica had the largest concentration of enslaved Ashanti in the Americas. Akin to their Ashanti origins, each of these stories carries its own proverb at the end. At the end of the story &quot;Anansi and Brah Dead&quot;, there is a proverb that suggests that even in times of slavery, Anansi was referred to by his Akan original name: &quot;Kwaku Anansi&quot; or simply as &quot;Kwaku&quot; interchangeably with &quot;Anansi&quot;. The proverb is: &quot;If yuh cyaan ketch Kwaku, yuh ketch him shut&quot;, which refers to when Brah Dead (brother death or drybones), a personification of Death, was chasing Anansi to kill him; its meaning: The target of revenge and destruction, even killing, will be anyone very close to the intended, such as loved ones and family members.

However, like Anansi&#x27;s penchant for ingenuity, Anansi&#x27;s quintessential presence in the Diaspora saw the trickster figure reinvented through a multi-ethnic exchange that transcended its Akan-Ashanti origins, typified in the diversity of names attributed to these Anansi stories, from the &quot;Anansi-tori&quot; to the &quot;Kuenta di Nanzi&quot;. Even the character &quot;Ti Bouki&quot;, the buffoon constantly harassed by &quot;Ti Malice&quot; or &quot;Uncle Mischief&quot;, a Haitian trickster associated with Anansi, references this exchange: &quot;Bouki&quot; itself is a word descending from the Wolof language that also references a particular folk animal (the hyena) indigenous to them. The same applies to Anansi&#x27;s role in the lives of Africans beyond the era of slavery; New World Anansi tales entertain just as much as they instruct, highlight his avarice and other flaws alongside his cleverness, and feature the mundane just as much as they do the subversive. Anansi becomes both an ideal to be aspired toward, and a cautionary tale against the selfish desires that can cause our undoing. Anansi has effectively evolved beyond a mere trickster figure; the wealth of narratives and social influences have thus led to him being considered a classical hero.

==Popular Anansi stories==

Among many stories attached to Anansi and collected in literature, one explains how he became known as the owner of all stories in the world. It is so popular that it has been studied and republished alongside other stories many times, including as children&#x27;s books, like the Caldecott Medal-winning &quot;A Story a Story&quot; by Gail E. Haley, which follows Akan oral tradition by beginning the tale with: &quot;We do not really mean, we do not really mean that what we are about to say is true. A story, a story; let it come, let it go&quot;. Haley&#x27;s story later continues it by concluding: &quot;This is my story that I have related. If it be sweet, or if it be not sweet, take some elsewhere, and let some come back to me.&quot; The following folktales listed will begin with this notable folktale alongside other anansesem (spider tales), some of which were recorded by Rattray in his prolific work on the subject; additional stories that arose out of the Anansesem tradition in the Diaspora have been included.

===Akan-Ashanti Anansi stories===
====How the Sky-God&#x27;s stories came to be Anansi&#x27;s stories====

One version of the most commonly-retold folktale was recorded by Rattray in his extensive book on Akan-Ashanti folktales, and as the tale generally goes, Anansi wanted to acquire the stories of the sky god Nyame, who held all the stories to himself. Nyame tasks Anansi with four challenges in exchange for them: the capture of the python Onini, the hornets known as Mmoboro, the leopard Osebo, and the fairy Mmoatia. Anansi agrees to the challenge and includes his mother Ya Nsia as part of the bet. 

Through cunning and the consultation of his wife Aso, Anansi succeeds in tricking the creatures into his capture. Anansi brings them along with Ya Nsia to Nyame, and the deity assembles a meeting within his kingdom of his elders, the Kontire and Akwam chiefs, the Adontem general of his army, the Gyase, the Oyoko, Ankobea, and the leader of his rear-guard, named Kyidom. Nyame then praises Anansi&#x27;s achievements and announces his stories will be known as Spider stories.

There are substantial variants of this tale, with other retellings like Haley&#x27;s omitting the characters Aso and Ya Nsia. Others, such as a Caribbean version, see Tiger as the one whom the stories come from. Another common version of this folktale portrays Mmoatia as a relatively solitary Fairy capable of turning invisible, while another does not require Anansi to capture Python.

====Anansi and the dispersal of wisdom====

Another popular story tells of how Anansi once tried to hoard all of the world&#x27;s wisdom in a pot (in some versions a calabash).

In this story, Anansi decides to gather all the wisdom he can find and keep it in a safe place inside of a pot all to himself. Anansi then decides to hide the pot from other people by placing it in a tree, but falls each time he tries to climb it while holding the pot. Anansi is later caught by his younger son Ntikuma, who mocks him by asking why Anansi never tied it behind him so he could climb easier. As a result, Anansi accidentally breaks the pot in anger at his son mocking him, causing all the wisdom inside to scatter as rain washes it away into rivers. At first Anansi blames his son Ntikuma, but realizes his son having to &quot;put him right&quot; proves that he wasn&#x27;t ready to keep the pot&#x27;s wisdom in the first place. Wisdom is then believed to exist everywhere because of Anansi&#x27;s mistake.

====How Anansi&#x27;s hind became big, and how his head became small====

In this story, a famine came to Anansi&#x27;s village and he told them he was going to search for food. He then embarked on a search and arrived at a stream being drained by spirits in the form of humans. Anansi observed the spirits were using their skulls to remove water from the river, and when they noticed him, the spirits asked if they could remove his so that he could help. Anansi obliged and began helping them remove water from the stream. 

While they drained the water, the spirits sang about their deeds and Anansi liked the song so much he asked if he could sing it, and they allowed him. Eventually the water was drained and the spirits gave Anansi his share of food and restored his skull, warning him not to sing the song again or it would fall off. Anansi agreed that he wouldn&#x27;t but later heard the spirits singing and broke his promise, only for his skull to fall apart. Anansi whined to spirits and they repaired his skull after he explained himself, but the spirits told Anansi they wouldn&#x27;t help him again if he sang it another time. Anansi made another promise not to.

However, Anansi heard the spirits singing elsewhere and sang the song anyway, which caused his skull to fall apart. Before it could hit the ground, Anansi caught his skull with his rear-end and fled in embarrassment.

====Why men commit evil at night, children play in moonlight, disputes are settled in daytime, and Anansi is Nyame&#x27;s messenger====

Nyame sired three children one day: Esum, or Night; Osrane, the Moon; and Owia, the Sun. All three grew to be successful, but Nyame considered his son Owia as his favorite, intending to make him a chief. Nyame thus proposed a challenge: Nyame decided that the son who could guess the name of a yam he had secretly harvested (known as &quot;Kintinkyi&quot;) would become the next chief and receive his royal stool. Soon, Nyame blackened his royal stool and asked his subjects if any could guess what his thoughts were. Anansi happened to be there and said that he knew, but was lying. Nyame told Anansi to gather his sons from the villages and in the process Anansi plotted to uncover the secret.

Anansi gathered feathers from every bird known and used them to fly, posing as a bird above Nyame&#x27;s village. The god didn&#x27;t recognize Anansi and began to repeat his desire for Owia to receive his stool by guessing the yam&#x27;s name. Anansi then did as Nyame asked and told Esum and Osrane to meet with Nyame; Esum gave Anansi roasted corn in exchange, while Osrane gave him a yam. Then, Anansi arrived at Owia&#x27;s village and informed Owia his father wished to see him.

Owia acknowledged his father&#x27;s wishes and then prepared the best sheep for Anansi to eat as thanks. In return, Anansi decided to tell Owia of his father&#x27;s intentions in secret, revealing the name of the yam he&#x27;d harvested. Anansi then made a pair of drums that would shout the yam&#x27;s name so that Owia would remember the name of Nyame&#x27;s yam, which was Kintinkyi, and the two returned to the other sons of Nyame. Anansi brought them each before Nyame, and Nyame called an assembly together so they could welcome them all. The Sky-God revealed his intentions to his three sons and allowed them each to guess in order of birth. 

Esum, who was oldest, did not know the name of Nyame&#x27;s yam and said its name was &quot;Pona&quot;, drawing boos from the crowd. Osrane, the second-oldest, also failed and assumed it was called &quot;Asante&quot;, causing the audience to boo him also. Owia, the youngest, was then given a chance to guess. Anansi played the drums as he had promised, and Owia remembered the true name of Nyame&#x27;s yam, &quot;Kintinkyi&quot;. Everyone cheered in response.

As a result, Nyame punished his son Esum and said evil things thus would happen during Esum&#x27;s time; he told Osrane that only children would play during his. As for Owia, Nyame praised him and made a chief, saying that any issue that needed to be settled would take place during his time. Nyame gave Owia a rainbow as a promise that he and his village would be protected from his brothers. Lastly, he gave Anansi his blessing for knowing his inner-thoughts and made Anansi his messenger.

====How diseases were brought to the tribe====

In this tale, Anansi went to the Sky-God Nyame one day. He wanted to take one of Nyame&#x27;s sheep, named Kra Kwame, and eat it. Anansi told Nyame that if he was allowed, he would bring Nyame a maiden as a gift from one of the villages in return. Nyame agreed and gave him the sheep, so Anansi left and set out for his home, later preparing the sheep. Once he was finished preparing it, Anansi searched for a village and discovered one where only women lived; the Spider settled there and gave each of them some of the sheep he had killed, marrying every woman in the village and forsaking his promise to Nyame. Soon however, a hunter visited the village that Anansi had settled in and witnessed what he was doing.

The hunter soon left and went to Nyame, reporting what he&#x27;d seen in the village. Nyame became furious upon learning of Anansi&#x27;s deception and ordered his messengers to go the village Anansi was living in and take every woman there. His messengers obeyed and took every woman, save one that was ill at that time, and presented them to Nyame. Disappointed, Anansi wasn&#x27;t sure what he&#x27;d do as he now only had one remaining wife, as she was too sick to help him. He asked her and she simply told Anansi to gather a gourd and bathe her, filling up the gourd with the water he&#x27;d used afterward; that water would then house all of the diseases that had afflicted her. Anansi obeyed his wife and she became incredibly beautiful; Anansi realized she was more beautiful than any of the other wives he&#x27;d taken on while living in the tribe, in fact, and smitten by her, Anansi remarried the woman. Yet, the hunter visited the village again. He saw Anansi&#x27;s wife, now beautiful beyond comparison, and returned to Nyame to report what he&#x27;d discovered.

The hunter told Nyame that Anansi had tricked him, because the women that Nyame had taken from Anansi were all hideous in comparison to the beautiful woman Anansi had as his current wife. Nyame was furious again, then ordered his messengers to send for her, and they went to Anansi&#x27;s village looking for the woman. Anansi met them and they told him of Nyame&#x27;s wish. He complied, showed them where his wife was, and they took her with them to Nyame. Anansi however, had a plan of his own, and began his scheme once they left.

Anansi searched for the gourd that had the water he&#x27;d bathed his wife with, and then took a skin and made a drum with it. He then made another drum and called for his son Ntikuma. Together the two began beating the drums and dancing while singing vulgarities. Anene the crow, another messenger of Nyame, saw what Anansi was doing and told Nyame about the dance. Nyame then sent his messengers and asked them to bring Anansi to him, as he wanted the Spider to perform the dance for him. Anansi however, told them that he could only perform his dance around his wives and that he needed his drum. He promised that he would dance before Nyame if he agreed to this, so the messengers informed Nyame and he agreed to Anansi&#x27;s terms. The messengers then brought Anansi to the harem where his wives were kept and he began playing. Soon Nyame came and danced to the song while the former wives of Anansi joined in.

Anansi&#x27;s final wife however, recognized the gourd Anansi&#x27;s drum was made from and decided not to dance, suspecting Anansi&#x27;s trickery. Yet, she was coerced into joining Nyame in the performance. Before she could begin however, Anansi opened the drum and tossed all the water from the gourd. All of the diseases that were once washed away returned and sickness fell upon the tribe. So it was that the Sky God caused Anansi to bring all illnesses to the world.

====How Kwaku Anansi took Aso as his wife, and how jealousy came to the tribe====

A long time ago, Aso was not yet married to Anansi. Instead, she was married to another man, known as Akwasi-the-jealous-one. Befitting his name, he was very possessive of Aso and wanted no one else to see or interact with her, so he built a small village where only the two of them lived. Akwasi-the-jealous-one was especially worried of losing Aso because he was sterile and knew that others would take her away from him if they lived among other people.

One day, Nyame grew tired of Akwasi-the-jealous-one&#x27;s failure and told young men in the other villages about his marriage with Aso. Nyame told the men that the first man to take Aso from Akwasi-the-jealous-one and sire a child could marry her. However, all of the men who accepted his challenge failed to capture Aso. Anansi watched all that transpired and soon went to Nyame himself; he promised Nyame that he could accomplish what other men had not. The Sky-God asked if Anansi was certain and the Spider answered that he would be able to as long as he was given the items he requested to help him, namely medicine to make guns as well as bullets. Nyame accepted his request and gave Anansi what he needed.

Soon, Anansi went throughout many villages and told them that Nyame had told him to bring the powder and bullets to them so that they could go hunting for him. Anansi told them that he would return and then take the meat they collected so that he could give it to Nyame. They agreed to his request and he then distributed powder and bullets amongst them until all villages had some. Anansi then left for a time and wove a palm-leaf basket, returning when he had finished to the villages he&#x27;d distributed hunting supplies to. In turn, he received all they&#x27;d hunted and soon headed for Akwasi-the-jealous-one&#x27;s settlement.

Eventually, Anansi came upon a river where Akwasi and Aso drank, then took some of the meat and placed it into the water. He then carried the basket with him, which still had more than enough meat, and reached Akwasi-the-jealous-one&#x27;s village. Aso noticed Anansi arrive and called out to her husband, surprised that Anansi had come. Kwasi-the-jealous-one came out and inquired who Anansi was, and the Spider replied that he&#x27;d come by the order of Nyame to rest on his journey. Akwasi-the-jealous-one came out praised Anansi and then welcomed Anansi to his village. Aso, on the other hand, noticed the meat Anansi had left in the river and told him what she&#x27;d discovered. Anansi simply replied that she was welcome to have it as he didn&#x27;t need it, and then informed Aso that she could feed any pets they possessed with it. Thus, Aso collected it, offering the meat to her husband. Anansi then asked Aso cook him some food, and she obliged, preparing to make Fufu.

Soon, Aso began preparing Fufu for Anansi, but he told her it was not enough when he learned what she was making. Anansi then asked her to use a larger pot, and when Aso did so, Anansi offered more of the meat he&#x27;d collected, with one caveat: out of the meat he possessed, Aso could only cook the thighs, which numbered 40. Aso obliged and she then placed the food alongside the rest she&#x27;d prepared when she finished cooking it. Aso then collected her own portion and the rest began eating as well. Anansi, however, was not satisfied and complained, saying that the fufu Aso had prepared lacked salt. Akwasi-the-jealous-one then asked Aso to bring some to Anansi, but the Spider objected: he told Akwasi that it was rude to command her to gather the salt when she was eating and suggested that he get the salt instead. Akwasi-the-jealous-one accepted Anansi&#x27;s advice and left to find more salt, while Anansi secretly snuck medicine from his pouch and put it into Akwasi&#x27;s fufu.

Akwasi-the-jealous-one soon returned, but Anansi informed Aso&#x27;s husband that he was full and no longer needed any; Akwasi sat the salt aside and began eating his fufu again, completely oblivious to what Anansi had done. Eventually, Akwasi-the-jealous-one realized he did not know Anansi&#x27;s name, and asked the Spider what he was called. Anansi replied that his name was &quot;Rise-up-and-make-love-to-Aso&quot;, which startled Akwasi, so he asked his wife Aso if she&#x27;d heard his name as well. Aso acknowledged that she did, and Akwasi left to prepare a room for Anansi as a result. When he finished, he told Anansi to sleep there, but Anansi replied that he couldn&#x27;t, because he was Nyame&#x27;s Soul-washer and only slept in a room with an open veranda. His parents had also conceived him there, so he was forbidden from sleeping in closed rooms.

Akwasi-the-jealous-one thus asked Anansi where he wished to sleep instead, but Anansi then made another excuse: the open room had to be in a house that belonged to Nyame. To do otherwise would make Akwasi equal to Nyame and break the commandment Anansi&#x27;d been given. Thus, Anansi asked Akwasi-the-jealous-one to give him a sleeping mat so he could sleep in front of their room while they slept. Soon, Anansi laid upon the sleeping mat and waited for Akwasi and his wife Aso to sleep and then sang a song to the gods while he played his sepirewa, certain the plan he&#x27;d concocted would be successful: &quot;Akuamoa Ananse, today we shall achieve something today. Ananse, the child of Nsia, the mother of Nyame, the Sky-god; today, we shall achieve something, to-day. Ananse, the Soul-washer to the Nyame, the Sky-god, today, I shall see something&quot;. Once Anansi finished, he put his sepirewa aside and fell asleep.

Suddenly, Anansi awoke to hear Akwasi-the-jealous-one calling out to him. Akwasi, however, refused to call the Spider by the name he&#x27;d been given, so Anansi remained silent; the medicine Anansi&#x27;d poisoned Akwasi-the-jealous-one with had worked. Akwasi tried another time, but refused to call Anansi by the name he&#x27;d given him again, so Anansi did not answer him. Eventually, Akwasi succumbed and finally pleaded &quot;Rise-up-and-make-love-to-Aso&quot;, falling for Anansi&#x27;s scheme. Anansi responded to Akwasi-the-jealous-one and opened his door, asking Akwasi what troubled him. Akwasi said that he needed to leave for a moment, and then left.

Once Akwasi-the-jealous-one was gone, the Spider went into the man&#x27;s room and saw Aso was awake. Anansi asked her if she&#x27;d heard what Akwasi had said, and she instead asked him to tell her. Thus Anansi repeated the name he&#x27;d given to them, implying that he was to make love to her. Aso accepted Anansi&#x27;s answer and the two made love, going back to sleep once they finished. Akwasi-the-jealous-one returned, completely unaware of what had happened, and soon went to sleep as well. However, his stomach would trouble him again and he&#x27;d call Anansi out for help using the same name Anansi had given him. Akwasi-the-jealous-one would leave while Anansi snuck into their bedroom to make love with Aso, for a total of nine times before morning came. Anansi left Akwasi&#x27;s village when the next day arrived and did not return. Two moons eventually passed and Aso&#x27;s pregnancy became visible. Akwasi-the-jealous-one asked his wife how she&#x27;d gotten pregnant, because he was sterile and could not sire children with her. Aso told Akwasi that he in fact had told her to make love to Anansi, explaining that the child she&#x27;d conceived was his. Akwasi thus decided to take her to Nyame&#x27;s village and the two left. However, Aso gave birth on the way, so she rested a moment. The two took the child to the village of Nyame afterward and told him what had taken place.

Nyame did not believe the two&#x27;s story and said that no one had left his village, urging them to point out the culprit among the villagers. Aso agreed to do so and soon saw Anansi sitting on a ridgepole in the distance. She pointed to Anansi and told Nyame that he was the one who&#x27;d impregnated her. He moved further down on the ridgepole in an attempt to hide again, but Aso found him there. However, this caused Anansi to fall over, dirtying himself, and in return Anansi complained that their actions had defiled him, for he was Nyame&#x27;s Soul-washer and Nyame&#x27;s wishes had been ignored. As a result, Akwasi-the-jealous-one was seized by Nyame&#x27;s subjects for disobeying the god&#x27;s command and ordered to sacrifice a sheep as penance. Utterly embarrassed, Akwasi finished his sacrifice and then told the Sky-God that Anansi could have Aso, giving her to the Spider to become his wife.

Yet there was another cost for what had transpired: the child Anansi had sired through Aso was taken and killed; what remained of its body was scattered throughout Nyame&#x27;s village as a reminder. So it was that Aso became Anansi&#x27;s wife, and jealousy came into the tribe.

====How Anansi got a bald head====

Sometime after they were married, it is said Kwaku Anansi the Spider and his wife Aso were living together. One day, they had returned from a visit to the plantation outside of the village, when a messenger came to them. Anansi approached the messenger and asked him why he&#x27;d come, and the man responded that Anansi&#x27;s mother-in-law had died the previous day. In response Anansi told his wife Aso what had taken place, and told Aso that they would go to the village to mourn her mother, as the funeral would take place within a few days. Soon the messenger left, and the next morning came. Anansi spared no time and went to the others in the village for a favor and found Odwan the Sheep, Okra the Cat, Okraman the Dog, Akoko the Fowl, and Aberekyie the Goat. Anansi told them of his mother-in-law&#x27;s passing and asked if they could accompany him to her funeral, and they agreed. Anansi thanked them, and then returned to his home to prepare.

Anansi made clothes to wear to the funeral, sewing a hat from leopard&#x27;s skin; he dyed his cloth russet, and had the attire he wished to wear prepared. Thursday eventually came and it was time to head out toward the village where the funeral of Aso&#x27;s mother would take place. He called those who&#x27;d agreed to accompany him, and they left the village, but not without supplies – guns, drums, palm-wine, and other things first so they would have things to share with the rest of those who attended as they celebrated his mother-in-law&#x27;s memory. Soon, Anansi reached his mother-in-law&#x27;s village and fired their guns in the air to signal they had arrived, and went to the home where her wake was taking place. Anansi shared all that he&#x27;d brought, giving palm-wine to those mourning. He then presented an offering to help pay for the funeral: six peredwan packets of gold dust, a velvet pillow, two cloths, a wool blanket, shell money (to barter with ghosts), a sheep, and more palm-wine. They accepted his offer, and the others matched it.

The next morning, everyone ate and invited Anansi to eat as well. However, Anansi said that he was not allowed to, as it was his mother-in-law&#x27;s funeral and he would not eat until the eighth day. Instead, Anansi said he&#x27;d gather some for his neighbors who&#x27;d accompanied him and remain while they left. True to his word, Anansi asked Aso to find them food and she brought it to them. Anansi bade them farewell, and he remained at the home. Days passed and he resisted eating, but when the fourth day came, he was too hungry to resist eating, and went to search for food inside the home where he was staying. He went into the kitchen and saw that there was a fire going, and at that fire there were beans boiling in a pot. Anansi decided he would eat those, so he took his leopard hat and scooped some of the beans inside once he was sure no one was watching him. However, just as soon as he placed on his hat to hide the beans, he saw Aso enter the room. Startled, Anansi hatched up another plan and told Aso that a hat-shaking festival was taking place in his father&#x27;s village; he intended to go there himself. Aso became suspicious and asked Anansi why he had not told her of the festival before; she reminded him that he had not eaten anything and advised the Spider to wait until the next day. However, Anansi refused to listen to his wife&#x27;s advice and she stormed off.

Aso gathered the people in the village and told them what Anansi was planning so they could hopefully keep him from leaving, and then headed back to her husband. Anansi saw Aso returning with the crowd and grabbed his hat, singing: &quot;Just now at my father&#x27;s village they are shaking hats! Saworowa, they are shaking hats! E, they are shaking hats, o, they are shaking hats! Saworowa!&quot; Anansi began to panic, because the beans in his leopard&#x27;s hat were burning him, and he told them he was leaving and would not remain whatsoever. Anansi left, but the villagers followed him, even when he told them to leave. In panic he sang again, &quot;Turn back, because: Just now at my father&#x27;s village they are shaking hats! Saworowa, they are shaking hats! E, they are shaking hats, o, they are shaking hats! Saworowa!&quot;

Now, the beans were unbearably hot upon his head, so Anansi threw his hat with its beans away. When Aso realized what Anansi had done, she and the villagers booed him and he ran away down the road. He promised the road that he would thank it if it helped him escape, and it agreed to, leading him away from the villagers and to medicine he could use. So it is that Anansi has a bald head, from the airs he gave himself during his mother-in-law&#x27;s funeral.

====Why Anansi runs when he is on the surface of water====

One day, Kwaku Anansi went to Okraman the Dog and told him he wished to build a new village to live in. Okraman heard Anansi&#x27;s suggestion and agreed with it, and Anansi then explained his plan: Okraman was to collect a rope-creeper on the Monday following the next Sunday Adae. Anansi would do the same, and the two would then meet together. Anansi told Okraman that he would gather a gourd and fill it with water and wished the Dog to do so also; the pair would have water in case their destination lacked it. Okraman agreed again and the two both prepared once the Sunday Adae began; Anansi even put honey into his gourd for extra measure. Then, the two traveled the next Monday.

Okraman and Anansi had reached the half-way point on their journey when the two became exhausted, and the Dog recommended they both rest for a moment and drink some of the water they&#x27;d prepared. Then, Anansi suggested that they play a game to pass the time while they rested. Okraman asked the Spider which type of game he wished to play, and Anansi replied that he wished to play a binding game. Anansi then explained the rules of the game: Okraman would tie Anansi, and then Anansi would tie Okraman. Anansi would give Okraman a signal, and the Dog would try to escape his bindings. Okraman however wanted Anansi to tie him first. Anansi disagreed, scolding the Dog, and reminded Okraman that he was his elder, causing Okraman to accept Anansi&#x27;s terms in their game. Thus, the two began and Okraman tied Anansi first.

However, Anansi did not know that Okraman was also hungry and had no true desire to play Anansi&#x27;s game. Instead, the Dog bound Anansi and carried him away, hoping to sell the Spider for food. Once Anansi realized Okraman&#x27;s plan, he began mourning, but the Dog paid him no mind, continuing to carry Anansi away until they both reached a stream. Soon, someone else noticed Anansi&#x27;s cries and came to investigate them: Odenkyem the Crocodile. He asked Okraman about the matter but the Dog was too frightened to respond. Instead, Okraman dropped Anansi and fled, while Odenkyem freed Anansi from his bindings. Anansi thanked the Crocodile and asked if there was a means he could repay him for his kindness, but Odenkyem said that he didn&#x27;t want anything in return. Yet, Anansi was insistent and told Odenkyem that if he had children he would come and style them, dressing their hair so that they could be very beautiful. Odenkyem accepted this, and did not suspect Anansi&#x27;s deception.

Anansi returned home after speaking to the Crocodile and told his wife Aso that he needed palm-nuts and onions for a stew he planned to make; he&#x27;d bring a crocodile back to supply meat for it. Aso did so, while Anansi gathered a knife, sharpening it. He mashed some eto, and carried it with him to the stream where Odenkyem lived. Next, Anansi called out to Odenkyem and told the Crocodile that he&#x27;d prepared a reward for him, sitting the eto in the water. Odenkyem heard Anansi and soon came, ready to accept Anansi&#x27;s gift. However, the Spider had tricked him; Anansi withdrew his knife and cut the Crocodile with it, but the blow he dealt to Odenkyem was not fatal; Anansi didn&#x27;t realize this however, and left for home without a second thought. Aso noticed Anansi didn&#x27;t have the crocodile he&#x27;d promised to bring home to prepare stew and asked him where it was, but Anansi became defensive, scolding his wife for bothering him when he&#x27;d just returned home. Aso however, saw through Anansi&#x27;s attitude, and told her husband that she could tell he had not gotten Odenkyem like he&#x27;d planned. Anansi could only remain silent, and said nothing else about the matter for the remainder of the evening.

Morning began and Aso told Anansi she was going to the river. The Crocodile was still laying there when she arrived, and flies now surrounded him; Aso took note of this, and told Anansi what she&#x27;d observed when she returned to their home. Anansi explained to Aso that he&#x27;d used a special medicine to kill Odenkyem and thus had to wait until the next day before he collected his kill; he then thanked her for confirming the crocodile had died and set about for the stream on his own, with a stick he&#x27;d prepared for defense. Anansi soon arrived and noticed Odenkyem was still laying in the riverbank. He carefully strode over to the Crocodile&#x27;s body, poking him with his stick. Then, Anansi prodded Odenkyem&#x27;s body and asked the Crocodile if he was dead, shifting his body over as he examined him, but Odenkyem did not respond. Little did Anansi know that the Crocodile may have been motionless, but he was far from deceased.

Anansi eventually stopped prodding the Crocodile with his stick, convinced he was dead, and edged closer to Odenkyem&#x27;s body, stretching his hand out to check the Crocodile a final time. Yet, Anansi&#x27;s action would prove to be a mistake, for he immediately found himself trapped between the Crocodile&#x27;s jaws when he clasped the Spider unexpectedly. After a great contest between the two, Anansi wiggled himself free from Odenkyem and fled the river, rushing back home. So it is that Anansi always runs while crossing the water, careful to never give Odenkyem another chance to capture him again.

==== How Anansi tricked two gods====
One day Ekuo and Sogblen went to go visit Anansi. However, when they knocked on his door, Anansi did not answer, and instead told his wife, Aso, to answer. 
When Ekuo asked where Anansi was, Aso said that he was upstairs. However, Anansi had webbed up the floor in front of the door, and hid under his bed, holding a web silk, so that when Sogblen entered the room, he tugged on the silk, setting off the trap, trapping Sogblen in webs. 
Ekuo came in next, but Anansi was prepared, so he came out disguised as his son. He said that Anansi had jumped out of the window, and when Ekuo looked outside, Anansi pushed him out and into another trap, which was a web that wrapped around Ekuo, with only three silks hanging from the roof suspending Ekuo in the air. 
Anasi then revealed himself, and robbed Sogblen of some of the yams he was carrying, and took Ekuo&#x27;s cowries, before going downstairs. 
He went to a rice field nearby and ate the yams, before going to buy something with the cowries. 
Meanwhile, Ekuo told his spear to free him from his trap, then free Sogblen. They then asked Aso if she had seen Anansi leave, and she said that she had seen him leave the house in the direction of a rice field.
Ekuo and Sogblen went there, and saw Anansi&#x27;s footprints trailed off to the market, so they followed them. 
Anansi saw the two coming and hid in a herd of cows. However, Ekuo was interested in buying one of the cows, and eventually saw Anansi. They grabbed him and brought him out into public, where they shamed him for his lack of hospitality. Anansi, humbled, walked home, where he had a meal alone, while Ekuo and Sogblen bought a cow, killed it, and had a public feast.

==== Why Anansi&#x27;s webs traps flies====

One day, Anansi was hungry, and had no food. He saw Wansena (the fly) eating kenkey outside of his house. Anansi went outside and asked for some, but the fly refused, saying that, instead, he would lead him to an area with an abundance of food. Wansena told Anansi to follow him, and he led him to a village in the jungle, where they produced a large amount of kenkey. Wansena told him that this was his home village, and so other flies lived there. Anansi ate a lot of kenkey, but he was still hungry, although Wansena told him that he couldn&#x27;t have any more. Anansi, angry, decided to set up a trap. He wove webs around the village, and covered them in a sweet - smelling substance whilst the villagers were sleeping. When they woke, one by one, they were attracted to the smell, and trapped in the web. When all of them were trapped, Anansi ate all of the kenkey in the village until he was full, before climbing his webs and going home, carrying even more kenkey with him. 
And that is why Anansi&#x27;s webs trap flies.

===Jamaican Anansi stories===

====How Anansi tied Tiger====

One day, Anansi was very hungry and couldn&#x27;t find anything to eat. He decided to take a basket, along with a large pot, and headed toward seaside to go fishing. The Spider then made a fire for his pot and called out to the sea, &quot;Hey Big fish come!&quot; Huge fish came and he caught some of them, placing them in his basket.

Anansi shouted &quot;Big fish go, make little fish come!&quot; next, scaring the big fish away. Smaller fish then came and he caught them also, placing them in his basket. Anansi repeated this until he filled both his pot and basket with a variety of fish, then sat his basket aside. Anansi spared no time cooking all of the fish he&#x27;d captured inside his pot and ate them. Anansi then collected his things once he was full and headed back toward his home, hiding his now-empty pot in a bush along the way. Eventually, Anansi met Tiger on his trek back home, and was frightened, because Tiger was very intimidating. Tiger demanded to know what Anansi had in his basket.

Anansi replied in a feeble voice that his basket was empty. Tiger let the Spider go about his way, but remained suspicious of Anansi, and decided to spy on the Spider once the two had gained some distance between each other. Tiger watched as Anansi soon sat near a tree and opened the basket with the fish he&#x27;d caught earlier that day. Next, Anansi began to remove each of the fish he&#x27;d caught and gloated over them; first a yellow-tail, then a snapper, and finally, a jack-fish. Tiger then sprung out of hiding and confronted Anansi about his deception.

Tiger caught Anansi in his lie and noted that the Spider had said he didn&#x27;t have any fish when they&#x27;d last spoke. Anansi made an excuse, however, and said that he&#x27;d gone to take a bath after they met and caught some fish while he was out bathing. Tiger thus demanded that Anansi give him all of the fish he&#x27;d caught, and the Spider obeyed. Tiger devoured all of Anansi&#x27;s fish and left only the bones for Anansi to eat, who took them up reluctantly and ate those instead. Anansi complained under his breath that all of his hard work had gone to waste and decided to spy on Tiger, planning to trick him. The two continued down the road and saw a fruit tree; knowing Tiger was greedy, Anansi remarked that there were pretty fruit in the tree. Tiger ordered Anansi to climb the tree and fetch some of the fruit, unaware of Anansi&#x27;s plot. Anansi conceded.

Anansi reached the top of the fruit tree and noticed Tiger was standing directly beneath him; the Spider warned Tiger that he could see lice in his hair. Tiger fell for Anansi&#x27;s ruse and demanded that Anansi catch the lice for him, but Anansi told Tiger that he needed him to lean against the tree first. Tiger agreed and Anansi came down, pretending to search for the lice he claimed to have seen. Soon his scheme was successful; Tiger fell asleep while Anansi did so, because of how long it was, and the Spider wasted no time tying Tiger&#x27;s hair to the fruit-tree. When he was finished, Anansi woke Tiger and told him that he couldn&#x27;t find any other lice in his hair. Tiger demanded that Anansi capture them all, but Anansi refused to help him. Tiger tried to attack Anansi in anger but was stuck; Tiger realized what Anansi had really done while he was asleep and ordered Anansi to untie his hair, but Anansi refused to and taunted Tiger, bragging that he&#x27;d tied him like a hog. Anansi was no longer afraid of Tiger and left his rival behind, heading home. Tiger, however, was not so lucky: a hunter soon saw Tiger by the fruit-tree and killed him.

===Surinamese Anansi stories===

====How Dew tricked Anansi====

It came about that Anansi became friends with Dew, and that they both helped each other develop their own crops. One day, Anansi saw his friend Dew&#x27;s crop and noticed the corn Dew grew was much finer than his own. Anansi became very jealous of Dew and craved the corn that Dew had grown more than his own, so he decided he would trick Dew. Anansi approached Dew and bragged, saying that his corn was better than Dew&#x27;s, and suggested that Dew cut his corn so it would be as fine as his. Anansi promised Dew that if he cut his own crop, his corn would grow back and be the same quality as Anansi&#x27;s corn was. Anansi however, was lying.

Nonetheless, Dew fell for the Spider&#x27;s schemes and agreed to cut his corn crop in the mistaken belief that his corn would grow again. Later that evening, neighbors in their village saw Dew&#x27;s corn had been cut down and wondered why he did so, noting that the corn he had was very fine once. They asked Dew who&#x27;d convinced him to cut down his corn crop, and he replied that Anansi had convinced him to do so, in the hopes that his corn crop would be better than it was before. The neighbors sighed and told Dew that he&#x27;d been tricked, for his corn would not grow again. This upset Dew, but he promised them that he would trick Anansi just as he had tricked him. Dew, however, would trick Anansi with his mother instead of with corn like Anansi had him.

As time passed, Dew worked especially hard and tirelessly to build up a large amount of wealth. He bought a scythe, hoe, axe, new clothes, and other equipment. Dew then told his mother his plan: he would tell Anansi that she had died and would then make a mock coffin in which to bury her. In the meanwhile, Dew wished for his mother to hide in their home upstairs while he prepared, so she did. Dew then made a coffin and announced her death to the village, inviting them to come see her burial. Once they had arrived, he snuck his mother from upstairs and had her hide underneath the floor where the mock coffin lay, as well as the many things he&#x27;d purchased, as he knew Anansi&#x27;s greed would spurn him to steal from Dew if he saw them laying around. Now that the plan was in order, it was time for the mock burial to begin.

Dew began to cry and lament that his mother had died so suddenly and left him nothing to remember her by. On-cue, Dew&#x27;s mother extended the scythe and other tools he&#x27;d purchased through the plank in the floor. Anansi saw what was happening and grew jealous of Dew, wishing his very own mother was dead so he could get what Dew was getting from his own mother as well. Dew continued to mourn, and lamented that he longed for a blessing from her in the form of money, so Dew&#x27;s mother took the money he had also given her alongside the equipment and threw it through the floor at him also. Thus his display was successful, the burial they&#x27;d staged went well, and those who had come to mourn his mother&#x27;s passing went back to their homes.

Anansi&#x27;s jealousy of Dew caused him to bicker with his own mother for days, on all matter of issues. Then, one day, they were arguing and the Spider asked his mother why she herself couldn&#x27;t have died just like Dew&#x27;s mother did. Soon, the arguments reached a climactic point and Anansi smote his own mother with a stick in a fit of rage. Anansi&#x27;s mother then died and he soon set about preparing for her burial just as Dew had before him. Then came time for the funeral, and Anansi cried just as Dew had, and told her all the things Dew had told his mother while grieving. Yet, nothing that he told his mother, no matter how much he cried, caused her to do the things that Dew&#x27;s mother had done for her son. The funeral was a failure, so Anansi went ahead with his mother&#x27;s burial.

About a week passed, and Dew had his mother come visit him while he worked outside in the fields. Anansi noticed Dew&#x27;s mother had come and asked if the woman he saw was in fact her. Dew replied that it was his own mother, and that it was payback for Anansi deceiving Dew about his corn crops. Dew then bragged that he instead had tricked Anansi about his Motherwell, rather than his corn, and such was true: Dew&#x27;s mother was still alive, but Anansi&#x27;s mother was now dead because of his own jealousy.

====Gun is dead====

One morning, Anansi was very hungry and needed food. He went to the bush and spoke with his friend Hunter, and told Hunter his dilemma, asking Hunter if he could have Gun. Hunter did so and gave the Spider his gun, then Anansi set about to concoct a scheme to obtain food. He told the animals in the village that it was time for them to bury Gun, their arch-enemy, for Gun had died. The animals knew Gun was very evil, for he had been killing many of them whenever he went through the bush. Thus when word of Gun&#x27;s passing reached them, the animals all rejoiced, and agreed that they would come to celebrate Gun&#x27;s death when Anansi buried him.

While the animals gathered to meet at Gun&#x27;s funeral, Anansi set a trap for them. Anansi made each of the animals pass in front of Gun&#x27;s coffin during the funeral while he and his children claimed that they would carry Gun to be buried. He pointed Gun at them all while they remained oblivious to his true plan. Soon, all those Anansi had called to the funeral were lined up in front of Gun&#x27;s coffin, and Anansi then struck. Anansi began using Gun to kill each of the animals that had arrived, until none else were alive or able to escape. Anansi then took their meat when the deed was done, and was able to feed his family with it.

====Anansi becomes a preacher, and why Cockroach and Anansi are enemies====

Anansi went to the King one evening and asked him if he could become a preacher. The King entertained Anansi&#x27;s offer and said that if he wished, he could preach the following Sunday. So Anansi prepared himself a sermon, and on that Sunday he preached a message. However, the King was busy that morning, and could not come to hear Anansi&#x27;s sermon. The King thus told Anansi that he wished him to preach again the following Sunday, and he gave him a black suit that he wished for the Spider to wear when he did.

It is said that Anansi lived beside Cockroach, and that between their homes was a fence that divided them. In addition to this, was a coconut tree that grew in Cockroach&#x27;s yard. However, it was a tree with branches covered in coconuts, some of which hung over the fence above Anansi&#x27;s yard. Anansi saw them hanging on his side of the yard one day, and took a machete. He then cut the bunch of coconuts directly in half, and took the ones that hung on his side of the fence for himself. Cockroach noticed this and took great offense at Anansi, asking him why he&#x27;d taken the fruit from his tree, as it clearly belonged to him. Anansi agreed that the tree belonged to Cockroach, but replied that the coconuts he&#x27;d cut down were hanging extremely low. The Spider explained that he only took the half that hung on his side, but Cockroach did not accept Anansi&#x27;s excuse. He vowed to get even with Anansi for what he&#x27;d done.

Soon, it was Saturday and Anansi would then have to preach before the King the next morning. Anansi asked his wife if she could clean his black suit so that it would be ready in time for the sermon, and she agreed. His wife took the black suit the King had given him and then hung it outside to dry. Cockroach however, noticed this taking place, and saw that half of Anansi&#x27;s suit hung above the fence separating his yard from Anansi&#x27;s. Cockroach then took his own machete and, eager to enact vengeance Anansi for cutting his coconut fruit, cut the half of Anansi&#x27;s suit that hung over his yard off.

The next morning, it was time to preach but Anansi saw what had happened to his suit and was unable to meet the King and deliver his sermon. The King thus did not get to hear Anansi preach at all and became very angry. In a fit, he had Anansi arrested and saw to it that the Spider was thrown into jail for offending him. Soon Anansi&#x27;s time was served, and the next time he saw Cockroach again, the Spider told him that he would never forgive Cockroach for his treachery. He would never forget it for as long as he lived, for Cockroach&#x27;s actions had cost him the job he wanted. So it was that Anansi tried and failed to become a preacher, and Cockroach became Anansi&#x27;s enemy.

====How Death came to the city====

A very long time ago, Death had no presence for he had not come to the cities yet. Death preferred to live deep inside a village in the bush. But a famine came one day and made Anansi very hungry, so he took Gun along with his hunting bag and decided to hunt for food. Anansi searched throughout the bush, but soon found that there were no animals he could find in the bush to eat. Anansi however, did not give up. Instead, Anansi continued to venture deep within the bush, searching for animals to hunt, and stumbled upon the village that Death lived in, and Death was seated in front of its entrance. Anansi did not want to offend Death, so he approached him and greeted him first. Anansi then told Death his plight, and noted that he had searched throughout the bush for an animal to kill for food, but had found none. Death told Anansi he could come into his village, and he would cook food for him.

Inside the village, Death brought Anansi to the house where meat was cooked, and Anansi saw that Death had a great amount. Anansi became enticed by all of the meat that Death was cooking, and saw that an enormous amount remained even after Death let the Spider have his fill of it to eat. Anansi thanked Death for his hospitality, but was still curious how Death had acquired such an impressive amount of meat, and asked him afterward. Death asked Anansi if he didn&#x27;t recognize who he was, and the Spider responded that he did, realizing why he had not been able to find meat in the bush; Death owned it all. Anansi thus asked Death for a favor, explaining that he had come to the bush so that he could find food for his family during the famine. Anansi wished to bring some meat back to them and asked for Death&#x27;s permission to do so. Death agreed, and gave Anansi meat that he could provide to his family.

Anansi took the meat that Death gave him and returned from the bush to his village in the city, where he met his family again and told them of his discovery. He told his wife that he could go to visit Death and take meat when necessary. However, Anansi&#x27;s greed overcame him and he told her that he could even steal meat from Death. Thus, instead of asking like he had before, Anansi returned to Death&#x27;s village while he was away and stole meat from him. Anansi&#x27;s scheme would not last, for Death noticed that meat was missing from his village, although he did not know who&#x27;d stolen it. Death decided to wait in secret to see if he could discover who the thief was.

Anansi came to Death&#x27;s village one day, completely unaware that he was still present, and then gathered a large basket of meat from his stores as he normally did. Death immediately surprised Anansi and asked him why he had chosen to steal from him, but Anansi was too afraid to answer his question. Instead, Anansi fled Death&#x27;s village and Death soon chased after him. Try as he might, Anansi could not lose Death, no matter how fast he ran through the bush, and by the time Anansi had reached the city the Spider looked behind him and saw that Death was still close to reaching him. Anansi then cried out to the people that Death was coming, and that they should shut their doors if they wished to live. Yet, many people could not shut their doors in time, and Death took them. So it is that Death now lives in the city; had Anansi not stolen from him, Death would still remain quietly in the bush where no one could find it.

==Relationship between Anansi and Br&#x27;er Rabbit==
Anansi shares similarities with the trickster figure of Br&#x27;er Rabbit, who originated from the folklore of the Bantu-speaking peoples of south and central Africa. Enslaved Africans brought the Br&#x27;er Rabbit tales to the New World, which, like the Anansi stories, depict a physically small and vulnerable creature using his cunning intelligence to prevail over larger animals. However, although Br&#x27;er Rabbit stories are told in the Caribbean, especially in the French-speaking islands (where he is named &quot;Compair Lapin&quot;), he is predominantly an African-American folk hero. The rabbit as a trickster is also in Akan versions as well and a Bantu origin doesn&#x27;t have to be the main source, at least for the Caribbean where the Akan people are more dominant than in the U.S. His tales entered the mainstream through the work of the American journalist Joel Chandler Harris, who wrote several collections of Uncle Remus stories between 1870 and 1906

One of the times Anansi himself was tricked was when he tried to fight a tar baby after trying to steal food, but became stuck to it instead. It is a tale well known from a version involving Br&#x27;er Rabbit, found in the Uncle Remus stories and adapted and used in the 1946 live-action/animated Walt Disney movie &quot;Song of the South&quot;. These were derived from African-American folktales in the Southern United States, that had part of their origin in African folktales preserved in oral storytelling by African Americans. Elements of the African Anansi tale were combined by African-American storytellers with elements from Native American tales, such as the Cherokee story of the &quot;Tar Wolf&quot;, which had a similar theme, but often had a trickster rabbit as a protagonist. The Native American trickster rabbit appears to have resonated with African-American story-tellers and was adopted as a cognate of the Anansi character with which they were familiar. Other authorities state the widespread existence of similar stories of a rabbit and tar baby throughout indigenous Meso-American and South American cultures. Thus, the tale of Br&#x27;er Rabbit and the Tar Baby represents a coming together of two separate folk traditions, American and African, which coincidentally shared a common theme. Most of the other Br&#x27;er Rabbit stories originated with Cherokee or Algonquian myths. In the USA today, the stories of Br&#x27;er Rabbit exist alongside other stories of Aunt Nancy, and of Anansi himself, coming from both the times of slavery and also from the Caribbean and directly from Africa.

==Anansi as a spiritual and mythological figure==
Anansi is often depicted in popular tales interacting with the Supreme Being and other deities who frequently bestow him with temporary supernatural powers, such as the ability to bring rain or to have other duties performed for him. Some folkloric traditions portray Anansi as the son of the Earth Mother Asase Yaa. In others, Anansi is sometimes also considered an Abosom (lesser deity) in Akan spirituality, despite being commonly recognized as a trickster. Thus, Kwaku Anansi is similar to Legba, who is also both a trickster and a deity in West African Vodun. However, Akan spirituality writ-large does not generally consider Anansi as an Abosom to the same extent that other established African trickster deities are worshiped in their respective religions; his connection to the sacred is ultimately believed to be folkloric in regards to his importance in Akan society. In essence among the Akan, Anansi and his stories are folkloric creations used to convey moral truths and give anecdotal explanations for natural phenomena and occurrences.This is supported by his limited use outside of storytelling, including his absence as a totem animal. Nevertheless, those who do recognize Anansi in a religious context in Akan spirituality acknowledge him as the Obosom of wisdom; he is even said to have created the first inanimate human body, according to the scholar Anthony Ephirim-Donkor. In the New World on the other hand, alternative religious views of Anansi have greater prominence in addition to his role as a folkloric character; followers of Haitian Vodou, for example, honor him as a Guede Lwa. Anansi being a Guede Lwa is a little bit different from the average Lwa as he belongs to the Guede family of loa. The Guede family represent the concept of death and fertility. It is for this reason that many people call Anansi a Guede Lwa, as he is the one who is responsible for maintaining the many connections between the living beings of the known world and the spirits of those that have passed away.

*Children&#x27;s singer Raffi wrote and recorded the song &quot;Anansi&quot; for his 1979 &quot;Corner Grocery Store&quot; album. The song describes Anansi as a spider and a man. It tells a story about Anansi being lazy yet clever, using flattery to trick some crows into shaking loose ripe mangoes from his mango tree for Anansi to enjoy without having to pick them himself.
*Cuban artist Celia Cruz performed the song &quot;Guede Zaina&quot;, a prayer devoted to Anansi, who is heavily associated with the Lwa &quot;Gede Zarenyen&quot; or &quot;Gede Zariyen&quot;, both which translate to &quot;Ghede Spider&quot; in Haitian Creole. Akin to the song&#x27;s Haitian origins, it is sung entirely in the respective language and its lyrics petition the Spider spirit for protection from danger. It was featured in her album &quot;Homenaje A Los Santos, Vol. 2&quot;, where Afro-Cuban religions were a major theme; several songs directly referenced African deities, including a song named after the Yoruba deity Shango, for example.

===Television and film===
*Prior to writing the book of the same name (referenced above), filmmaker and author Gerald McDermott created the animated short &quot;Anansi the Spider&quot; in 1969. Narrated by Athmani Magoma, it briefly explains the function of folklore, introduces the Ashanti people, and retells two tales about Anansi and his six sons.
*Rabbit Ears Productions released a VHS adaptation featuring two Anansi stories as part of its &quot;We All Have Tales&quot; series in 1991. The story was illustrated by Steven Guarnaccia and the accompanying video was narrated by Denzel Washington, with background music by UB40.
*Anansi appears in &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, voiced by LeVar Burton. This version is a giant spider-like spirit, and one of Oberon&#x27;s &quot;children&quot;.
*A superhero called Anansi appears in the DC Animated Universe series &quot;Static Shock&quot;, voiced by Carl Lumbly. He is from Ghana, and part of a lineage of heroes who wield an ancient amulet that grants powers of illusion and the ability to adhere to any surface. Additionally, he has three enemies modeled after those of the mythological Anansi: Osebo (Michael Jai White), Onini (Kevin Michael Richardson), and Mmoboro (Phil LaMarr).
**Anansi also appears in the one-shot comic &quot;Static Team-Up: Anansi&quot; #1 (June 2023).
*Anansi the Spider narrated stories from African folklore on the PBS children&#x27;s series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, voiced by Ossie Davis. These cartoon segments by Fred Garbers were introduced by Sonia Manzano, who also portrayed Maria.
**The Sun and the Moon aka A Home in the Sky
**Monkey and Baboon&#x27;s Compromise
**The Little Mouse
*Soviet short animated film Паучок Ананси (Russian: &quot;Anancy the Spider&quot;) premiered in 1970.
*&quot;Anancy Turns Over A New Leaf&quot; animated film was produced by Lalu Hanuman in 2000. He followed this up in 2001 with a second Anancy animated film &quot;Anancy&#x27;s Healthy Diet&quot;. In 2001 also, the National Film Board of Canada created the animated short film &quot;The Magic of Anansi&quot;, which focuses on a Caribbean Anansi tale and was directed by Jamie Mason, with Tamara Lynch as its producer. The film was part of its &quot;Talespinners&quot; collection of short films based on children&#x27;s stories from Canada&#x27;s cultural communities. The film can also be found on the digital archive Wayback Machine.
*&quot;Mr. Nancy&quot; is a character in seasons 1 and 2 of the television adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;American Gods&quot;, portrayed by Orlando Jones (see &quot;Books&quot;, above).
* &quot;Aunt Nancy&quot; is a female character on the SYFY series &quot;Superstition&quot;, portrayed by Jasmine Guy.
* &quot;Kwaku Ananse&quot; is a 2013 short film by Akosua Adoma Owusu.
* Anansi is the name of a villain in &quot;&quot; [voiced by Laila Berzins], who has spider-like abilities, including webbing and extra limbs. It is also the stage name of the villain&#x27;s civilian form, Nora Césaire, who uses it in kickboxing matches. Within the same episode, the Turtle Miraculous and its abilities are introduced, alluding to &quot;Anansi and the Turtle&quot;.

===Video games===

== The Anansy Festival ==
The Anancy Festival was created by Xavier Murphy, the founder of Jamaicans.com, educator Cathy Kleinhans, and Dr. Andrea Shaw-Nevins, the Dean of Farquhar Honors College at Nova Southeastern University, to connect children of Caribbean descent with the traditions of their ancestors through stories, song, dance, arts and crafts, book and poetry readings, and other art forms. The first Anancy Festival was held in Pembroke Pines, Florida, on June 30, 2007. Children&#x27;s author Kellie Magnus joined the founders in 2011 to coordinate the Anancy Festival in Kingston, Jamaica. Since 2007, the Anancy Festival has been staged in Pembroke Pines, Florida; Orlando, Florida; Ft. Lauderdale, Florida; Plantation, Florida; Jamaica, Queens, New York; Boston, Massachusetts; Washington, DC; Kingston, Jamaica; Nairobi, Kenya; and Accra, Ghana.

<text>Reginald &quot;Reggie&quot; Mantle is a fictional teenager in stories published by Archie Comics; he is introduced by writer-artist Bob Montana and John L. Goldwater in &quot;Jackpot Comics&quot; #5 (cover-dated Spring 1942). He also appears in CW&#x27;s &quot;Riverdale&quot;. He is the frenemy of Archie Andrews, as well as the bassist of The Archies. The live-action version of Reggie is portrayed by Ross Butler and Charles Melton in &quot;Riverdale&quot; and Vedang Raina in &quot;The Archies.&quot;

==Publication history==
Reggie Mantle debuted in &quot;Jackpot Comics&quot; #5 (cover-dated Spring 1942). An enduring character, he appears across the Archie Comics line and headlined the series &quot;Archie&#x27;s Rival Reggie&quot; (14 issues, 1949 n.d. – Aug. 1954), which returned a decade later as &quot;Reggie&quot; for the sporadically published issues #15-18 (Sept. 1963 – Nov. 1965). The series was renamed &quot;Reggie and Me&quot; for issues #19 – #126 (Aug. 1966 – Sept. 1980).

Other series include &quot;Reggie&#x27;s Wise Guy Jokes&quot; (55 issues, Aug. 1968 – Sept. 1980), and the three-issue miniseries &quot;Reggie&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (Spring 1994 – Spring 1995).

Reggie appears as a main character in the 2015 &quot;Archie&quot; and &quot;Jughead&quot; titles that launched the New Riverdale reboot. On 20 September 2016, it was announced that a five-issue miniseries titled &quot;Reggie and Me&quot; would be published as part of the launch. It was written by Tom DeFalco with art by Sandy Jarrell.

==Fictional character biography==
Reggie Mantle is arrogant and selfish, and frequently in conflict with Archie, despite their apparent friendship. He is usually depicted as athletic, and is seen as attractive and desirable by girls. He says in one story that he was born in Texas. Reggie&#x27;s family is upper class, although nowhere near the level of Veronica Lodge; the latter often uses Reggie to make Archie jealous when she is upset with Archie for some reason, which Reggie relishes. In Reggie&#x27;s debut story, Archie refers to him as, &#x27;that snooty Reggie Mantle&#x27;, indicating his upper-class background. 

Compared to the families of the other main characters, Reggie&#x27;s family members have made very few appearances in the comics through the decades. His father, Ricky Mantle, owns a newspaper-publishing company, one of his publications is &quot;The Riverdale Gazette&quot;. (Reggie seems to show journalistic aspirations himself, often working as the editor of the high school paper, Blue and Gold. He is quick to use the term &quot;freedom of the press&quot; to defend controversial or inflammatory articles.) Little is known of his mother, though her name was eventually revealed to be Vicky Mantle. Reggie has a brother, Oliver Mantle, who has appeared in &quot;Life With Archie&quot; issue #26. His cousin May is often mistaken for a pre-teen. After a makeover, she attracts attention at a school dance, but chooses to dance with Dilton (a short, nerdy boy). Another cousin, Regina, displays Reggie&#x27;s cruel humor and bullying tendencies, but after a date with Jughead she appears to have enjoyed herself. Reggie also has a number of relatives whom he often uses to get favors.

Reggie has been known to boast that his family is the only one in Riverdale that has its own coat of arms.

== Interests and personality ==

Reggie Mantle&#x27;s chief characteristics are his love of sarcasm and practical jokes, his vanity, his athletic abilities, and his interest in dating multiple women.

Reggie is a naturally gifted and talented athlete who excels at nearly every major sport, including football, baseball, and basketball, along with more obscure sports such as cross country running and Kung Fu. He often works as a surfing or skiing instructor. Sometimes, if his skills are not enough to secure victory, Reggie cheats, and he often shows little team spirit. Once in a while, Reggie tries to win competitions on a technicality by pulling out a rulebook.

The most common accessories associated with Reggie are the mirror and the comb. A lot of jokes in the comics are about his vanity, earning him the nickname &quot;Reggie &#x27;I-Love-Me&#x27; Mantle&quot;. Somewhat of a fashion plate, Reggie is the character who most frequently experiments with his hairstyle to match current trends. These looks have lasted months (rather than been contained within a single story) and have included several incarnations of sideburns, pomaded, short, shaggy, and even a ponytail in the early 1990s. Reggie is one of the founding members of the band The Archies, serving primarily as their bassist and occasionally as lead guitarist. He views himself as the most important and talented member of the group—and has gone to great lengths to prove it, such as hiring groupies to scream his name during concerts. Reggie has also demonstrated skill in singing, acting, and piano.

Reggie is Riverdale High&#x27;s resident prankster. It is not unusual for Reggie&#x27;s practical jokes to backfire. His pranks are usually meant to embarrass his victims rather than physically hurt them. Reggie&#x27;s sharp, quick wit has also led him to work part-time as a stand-up comedian at a Riverdale comedy club; he has expressed interest in pursuing a professional comedy career. In spite of his evident upper-middle class status, he is remarkably cheap, and the first time his schoolmates remember him inviting them to a party, he had filled the room with vending machines from which to obtain the party food.

Reggie likes to chase girls, delighting in the pursuit, but is not usually interested in having a serious relationship with one girl. Reggie likes to play the field, and openly describes himself as &quot;a true practitioner of the art&quot;. He has expressed horror at the idea of being tied down to one solitary female, saying that, &quot;having one girl is like having one peanut, one potato chip.&quot;

Reggie is Archie Andrews&#x27;s rival, and has a perennial crush on Veronica Lodge. The fact that she loves Archie makes Reggie jealous, so he spends most of his time trying to outwit Archie, and playing practical jokes on him. Despite the rivalry, he and Archie are generally amicable, and often spend time together pursuing dates or practicing athletics. In &quot;Archie&#x27;s Double Digest&quot; #201, during the possibility of Archie moving, he eventually admits he would miss Archie, whom he calls his best friend. In certain older Archie Comics stories, Reggie and Archie team up to play pranks on Jughead Jones; however, their schemes usually backfire as Jughead outwits them.

Other than Veronica, Reggie is romantically interested in Midge Klump, the girlfriend of brawny but dimwitted athlete Moose Mason. A running gag in the series features Reggie attempting to spend time with Midge without attracting Moose&#x27;s anger and jealousy. He occasionally seeks to date other women, including Betty Cooper. Reggie and Betty frequently join forces to try and break up Archie and Veronica. In some stories, Reggie and Betty are shown to be a couple, even though their respective interests still lie with Veronica and Archie; for example, the &quot;Life with Archie&quot; series portrays a future in which Archie marries Veronica and Betty and Reggie are a loving couple. In other storylines, Reggie has occasionally been known to date Cheryl Blossom. The two have very similar personalities and, at one point, before she dates a boy named George, try going out together. Like Betty and Veronica, however, Cheryl mainly uses Reggie as an alternative to Archie. Another arc features Reggie falling in love with Veronica&#x27;s cousin Harper and developing a long-distance relationship with her.

Reggie is insanely jealous of anyone else but him being in the spotlight, and will sometimes deliberately cause them trouble to get what he wants.

On certain occasions, Reggie shows a kinder side where he will come to the aid of his friends or total strangers, although he prefers to keep these good deeds secret. In one comic, he has a close childhood friendship with an elderly woman named Mrs. Finklehoff. Due to Reggie&#x27;s reputation for arrogance and scheming, his peers often distrust his motives even when he is genuinely intending to help someone.

==Alternate versions ==
In &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot;, Reggie Mantle caused the zombie apocalypse. Midge asks him for money so she can pay for an abortion. This frustrates and angers him to the point that when he sees Hot Dog on the side of the road he swerves to hit him. He immediately regrets his actions and tries to carry Hot Dog to a vet, failing that, he takes him to Jughead&#x27;s lawn so that he can die at home. Hot Dog&#x27;s subsequent reanimation results in him infecting Jughead and starting the zombie apocalypse.

Reggie survives with the others on the road, growing increasingly bitter towards Archie for becoming a natural leader and thriving while he is continually wracked with guilt for starting all this horror. Archie remains oblivious to this, intending to make Reggie the best man at his wedding to Betty. Reggie eventually goes out hunting with Kevin and tells him how he caused the apocalypse, how he killed Hot Dog, how he fears he might be a sociopath and how he thinks the only way to end the zombie plague is by offering himself up to the horde so they can have their revenge and hopefully stop their rampage. He wanders off alone into the woods. Kevin tells the others his story, and Archie wants to go after him but Veronica and Betty convince him otherwise.

Reggie walks into the horde, expecting to be torn limb from limb, but instead they part for him until he reaches the zombified Jughead. The zombified Hot Dog walks forward, and Reggie kneels before it, expecting it to kill him and accepting his fate. But, at that moment a vision of Sabrina Spellman appears before him. She tells him that they will make the zombified Midge whole once again and make her do whatever Reggie wants if Reggie returns to his friend and kills Betty Cooper. Reggie&#x27;s resolve to redeem himself crumbles upon being offered Midge and he responds with &quot;Kill Betty Cooper... sure, why not?&quot;

<text>Archibald &quot;Archie&quot; Andrews, created in 1941 by publisher John L. Goldwater and artist Bob Montana in collaboration with writer Vic Bloom, is the main character in the Archie Comics franchise, including the long-running &quot;Archie Andrews&quot; radio series, a syndicated comic strip, &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot;, and &quot;Riverdale&quot;. With the creation of Archie Andrews, publisher John Goldwater hoped to appeal to fans of the Andy Hardy films starring Mickey Rooney. Archie Andrews is the rhythm guitarist and one of the three singers of the fictional band The Archies. He is portrayed by KJ Apa on &quot;Riverdale&quot; and Agastya Nanda in &quot;The Archies&quot;. For his physical appearance, he has red hair, freckles on his cheeks, and light-colored skin. In &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot;, he appears to be of Scottish-American descent, as shown in the episode &quot;The Day the Earth Moved&quot;, when his father wanted to keep with their family tradition and wear a kilt while ringing the bell of Riverdale.

==Character==
===Creation===
Archie Andrews debuted in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #22 (cover-dated Dec. 1941). The &quot;Little Archie&quot; series, published from 1956 through the mid-1990s, chronicles the adventures of pre-teen Archie and his friends while in elementary school.

===Concept===
Archie is a typical small-town teenager, who lives in Riverdale, where he attends Riverdale High School. He is extremely clumsy and can make some dumb mistakes, but always has the best of intentions. He forms a crush on rich girl Veronica Lodge, but also loves his next-door neighbour, Betty Cooper, forming the love triangle driving many of the comic&#x27;s plot lines. Archie is one of the three vocalists and the rhythm guitarist of his band, &quot;The Archies&quot;, along with Betty and Veronica, his best friend Jughead Jones, as well as his nemesis Reggie Mantle, who battles Archie for Betty and Veronica&#x27;s affections. Archie often comes into conflict with Veronica&#x27;s rich father, Hiram Lodge, and Riverdale High&#x27;s principal, Waldo Weatherbee.

===Biography===
He is the only child of Mary and Fred Andrews. His father works as a mid-level business executive. His mother, initially a homemaker, takes a job at a real estate agency in later years. Mary and Fred Andrews are of Scottish descent. Archie&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Andy Andrews, immigrated to the United States from Scotland and befriended Moose Mason&#x27;s Russian ancestor, who had emigrated at the same time. Archie has been depicted wearing the traditional kilt of his ancestors and playing bagpipes (but not very well). His childhood is featured in the &quot;Little Archie&quot; stories, where he had a dog named Spotty.

Outside of dating, Archie largely enjoys sports. He plays baseball, basketball, and football for the Riverdale High teams. Though often not as good an athlete as Moose Mason, Chuck Clayton or Reggie Mantle, he proves a valuable member of the school team. Coaches Kleats and Clayton value him for both his athletic abilities and his team spirit. However, Archie&#x27;s athletic abilities vary from story to story, due to his frequent clumsiness. He also has a tendency to pay more attention to cheerleaders than to his playing. For this reason, Coach Kleats often tries to avoid resorting to use Archie in a game.
Automobiles are one of Archie&#x27;s hobbies, and he is passionate about his car. For decades, he was shown driving a 1916 Ford Model T jalopy called &quot;Betsy&quot;. In Archie double digest No. 192, it is said to be a Model A. In a story during which Archie tried to have his jalopy insured, he described it as being a &quot;Ford, Chevy, Plymouth, Pierce-Arrow, Packard, DeSoto, Hudson ...&quot; explaining that his jalopy was &quot;a collection of replacement parts from several junkyards&quot;, some of which dated back to 1926.

Archie&#x27;s jalopy was destroyed permanently in issue No. 238 of &quot;Life With Archie&quot;, which was published in 1983.
In the newer comics, he drives a mid-1960s&#x27; Ford Mustang, which is more contemporary in appearance, but still unreliable and prone to breakdowns. &quot;Archie Digest&quot; 239, published in October 2007, included a new story in which the one and only Mr. Lodge owned an antique car that had a strong resemblance to Archie&#x27;s jalopy. The story featured Archie&#x27;s grandfather who, as a teenager, looked and dressed like Archie from the 1940s. It turned out that he owned the same jalopy that Mr. Lodge now owned.

====Death====
In April 2014, 72 years after the character&#x27;s first appearance, Archie Comics announced that the adult Archie would die in the July 2014 issue (#36) of &quot;Life with Archie&quot;, while the teenage Archie would continue in the other Archie comic series titles. Archie dies when he is shot in the abdomen while saving his friend, Senator Kevin Keller. The story is written so as to terminate both storylines, without committing to which girl Archie married, and contains several flashbacks to the &quot;Little Archie&quot; days. The final issue (#37) is set one year after Archie&#x27;s death. All his friends memorialize him, and Riverdale High School is officially renamed Archie Andrews High School in his honor. The story ends with Jughead, owner of Juggie&#x27;s (formerly Pop&#x27;s Chock&#x27;lit Shoppe), serving a sundae to three children who resemble Little Archie, Betty, and Veronica.

==Relationships==
===Romances===
Archie and Betty have been best friends and love interests all their lives. When Veronica Lodge moved to Riverdale, however, he switched his attention to her, making Betty both angry and jealous. She began competing with Veronica for his affection.

In the comics, he sometimes thinks of Betty more as a close friend and confidante. He likes that she is always available as a back-up when he does not have a date with Veronica.

He dislikes it when Betty dates other boys, wanting her to stay available as his second choice. Now that Betty sporadically dates Jason Blossom and Adam Chisholm, Archie shows a tinge of jealousy. Archie is married to Betty in Archie Marries Betty: Life With Archie series and is married to Veronica in Archie Marries Veronica: Life with Archie series. Both scenarios produce different outcomes for Archie&#x27;s overall life, as well as Betty&#x27;s and Veronica&#x27;s.

Archie often competes for the attention of Betty and Veronica with his rival, Reggie Mantle, and occasionally other boys. Veronica keeps Archie guessing, never letting him take her for granted. Betty, on the other hand, clearly lets Archie know she adores him. Archie chooses to keep fighting for Veronica.

A third love interest is a wealthy red-headed girl named Cheryl Blossom. At first, she was deemed too sexual and a bit promiscuous and was taken out of the series, but due to her popularity, she was brought back in &quot;Love Showdown&quot;, a four-part mini-series in which Archie attempts to make a decision between Cheryl, Betty, and Veronica.

In &quot;Archie&quot; No. 608 (May 2010), Archie began a relationship with Valerie Brown, making her Archie&#x27;s first girlfriend of African descent. The Archies and Josie and the Pussycats were touring together and, while rehearsing, Archie and Valerie secretly fell in love as they co-wrote the song &quot;More Than Words&quot; that described their feelings. Issue No. 609 revealed that this relationship had seeped into common knowledge by the end of the tour. Archie and Valerie were forced apart when the Pussycats were touring Europe without the Archies, but hoped to keep their relationship going. In the comic &quot;Archie Marries Valerie&quot;, Valerie is expecting a baby with Archie, whom they name Star.

In &quot;Archie&quot; No. 700 (July 2019), which signifies the start of another soft reboot, it is revealed that Archie got into a relationship with Sabrina Spellman over his summer break while everyone was on vacation after she had saved him from a pack of wolves.

====&#x27;Archie Marries&#x27; issues====
On May 15, 2009, Archie Comics announced that Archie would finally pick one of the girls to marry, in a story arc in &quot;Archie&quot; #600–606 (Aug. 2009 – Feb. 2010). However, Archie Comics publicly revealed this to be a dream sequence to show two possible futures: one where Archie marries Veronica (issues 600–602), and the other Betty (603–605). In both, he has twins: a boy also named Archie who looks like him, and a girl named after and resembling whichever girl he married. Issue 606 was an epilogue to &quot;Archie Marries Veronica/Archie Marries Betty&quot; that returns to the comics&#x27; old format.

===Friends===

Jughead Jones has been Archie&#x27;s best friend ever since childhood. When Jughead first came to Riverdale, he was in a bad mood and tended to dismiss Archie. However, Archie, of good heart, tried to cheer up Jughead and the two have been inseparable ever since. Jughead wears a trademark clubhouse beanie (a Depression-era style of makeshift hatwear, crafted from an inverted fedora with a scallop-cut brim, and decorated with assorted pinbacks) and an inscrutable, closed-eyelid expression. Often Jughead has to help Archie out from a tricky situation. Jughead usually knows when Archie&#x27;s ideas will not work, but is powerless to avoid getting involved.

Reggie Mantle is Archie&#x27;s constant romantic and athletic rival. Each often makes attempts to separate the other from Veronica, occasionally exhibiting physical violence, and both have won their fair share of scrapes with each other. Reggie takes every opportunity to play practical jokes on Archie and make cynical wisecracks. However, Reggie is often shown as a companion to and of Archie despite his arrogance and competitive nature, and they are often seen together practicing athletics or pursuing dates.

Archie&#x27;s other friends include Dilton Doiley, the local genius who gets Archie into and out of trouble through his experiments and inventions; Moose Mason, the dim-witted but likable star athlete of Riverdale High who is often Archie&#x27;s teammate; Chuck Clayton, another of Archie&#x27;s teammates who was originally shy and reclusive but came out of his shell when Archie befriended him; Moose and Chuck&#x27;s girlfriends Midge Klump and Nancy Woods, two of the very few attractive girls Archie does not fall for; and Ethel Muggs, a girl with an enormous crush on Jughead, who often wins his heart with the use of fresh-baked cookies.

====The Archies====

The Archies is a garage band containing Archie (vocals and rhythm guitar), Reggie (bass), Veronica (vocals and keyboards), Betty (vocals, lead guitar and percussion), and Jughead (drums). Archie founded the group himself. Although not as famous as Josie and the Pussycats, the band plays numerous gigs and has some notoriety. In the Little Archies series, the band just starts to form, although Archie, Betty, Jughead, Reggie, and Veronica start to play different kind of songs.

==Appearances==
===Radio===
Montana&#x27;s characters were heard on radio in the early 1940s. &quot;Archie Andrews&quot; began on the NBC Blue Network on May 31, 1943, switched to Mutual in 1944, and then continued on NBC radio from 1945 until September 5, 1953. The program&#x27;s original announcer was Kenneth Banghart, later succeeded by Bob Shepard (during the 1947–48 season, when Swift and Company sponsored the program) and Dick Dudley. Archie was first played by Charles Mullen (1943–1944), Jack Grimes (1944) and Burt Boyar (1945), with Bob Hastings (1945–1953) as the title character during the NBC years. Jughead was portrayed by Hal Stone, Cameron Andrews and later by Arnold Stang. Stone later wrote about his radio career in his autobiography, &quot;&quot; (Bygone Days Press, 2003). During the NBC run, Rosemary Rice portrayed Betty, Gloria Mann portrayed Veronica, Alice Yourman portrayed Archie&#x27;s mother, Mary Andrews and Arthur &quot;Art&quot; Kohl was Archie&#x27;s father, Fred Andrews.

<doc id="99507" wikidata="Q653007" url="?curid=99507" title="Galactic empire">
<text>Galactic empires are a science fiction setting trope, in which most or all of the habitable planets in the setting&#x27;s galaxy are ruled by a single centralized political entity. Galactic empires most frequently appear in works in the sub-genres of science fantasy and space opera, although they may appear in other sub-genres as well. Works featuring galactic empires may have them as the story&#x27;s focus, chronicling the empire&#x27;s growth and/or decline. Alternatively, they may merely serve as a backdrop against which the events of the story play out. 

While depictions of galactic empires can vary wildly from work to work, most galactic empires share several key tropes:

* The empire, or at least its wealthier and more powerful regions, has advanced considerably in science and technology compared to current human civilization.
* Among these advances are some form of faster-than-light travel, which enables transit and communication across the empire&#x27;s extent to occur in a reasonable time frame.
* Habitable worlds are either directly administered by representatives of the centralized imperial government, or else their local leadership is ultimately subordinate to the central government.

Characterizations of these empires can vary wildly from work to work. They may be benevolent or malevolent; all-powerful or too weak or incompetent to exert power in anything but name; or anywhere in between. 

==Background==

Most of these galaxy-spanning domains depend on some form of transportation capable of quickly or instantly crossing vast cosmic distances, usually measured in light-years, many times faster than familiar particles such as photons traveling at light speed. These, instantaneous or faster-than-light (FTL) (tachyonic) technologies invariably require some type of propulsion or displacement technology forbidden by Albert Einstein&#x27;s theories on relativity. Described methods often rely on theories that circumvent or supersede relativity: for instance, the hypothesis of a warp drive (such as, more specifically, an Alcubierre drive) that bends the fabric of space-time.

In many cases, the term &quot;galactic empire&quot; is misleading. First, the &quot;galactic&quot; in &quot;galactic empire&quot; suggests an organization encompassing far more star systems than is actually described. This may come about as a result of propaganda exaggerating the spread of an imperial entity in order to appear stronger than is actually the case — just as historical nation-states such as the &#x27;Holy Roman Empire&#x27; presented themselves; being roughly twice the size of modern Germany. While some of the noted fictional empires encompass a large portion of the galaxy, many other empires may be classified as interplanetary or interstellar empires, since they encompass only a local group of star systems.

When works feature galactic empires that truly do span most or all of their parent galaxy, they usually depict their capital as a &quot;core world&quot;, a planet in a star system relatively close to a galaxy&#x27;s supermassive black hole. Typically, &quot;core worlds&quot; will be portrayed as wealthier and more politically powerful than &quot;rim worlds&quot; closer to the edge of the galaxy. However, this portrayal, while common, is not universal; many works may invert this dynamic or reject it altogether.

Second, the &quot;empire&quot; in &quot;galactic empire&quot; is also misleading, as it suggests the empire&#x27;s government is authoritarian to at least some degree, if not completely autocratic. While many galactic empires do correspond to this description, many do not: galactic empires may adhere to any real-world political philosophy, or a unique form of governance created by the work&#x27;s author(s). A prominent example of a non-autocratic galactic empire is the Galactic Republic of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, which is a hybrid regime parliamentary democracy (albeit one that collapses into fascist dictatorship over the course of the story).

==Notable examples==

===Star Wars===
The best known such organization to the general public today is the Galactic Empire from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which was formed in turn from the Galactic Republic.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; depicts an empire ruled autocratically by Darth Sidious, supported by a powerful space navy. It is stated in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film that there was an Imperial Senate that was later disbanded by the Emperor. There was a galactic empire called the Sith Empire founded by Darth Revan. This galactic power was close to overthrowing the Jedi&#x27;s Republic during the Jedi Civil War. 

As a military dictatorship based upon fear and terror, the Empire is an explicitly villainous force with linguistic and visual traits directly reminiscent of Nazi Germany. For example, their armored forces known as &quot;stormtroopers&quot; are named analogously to the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (often known as the &quot;SA&quot;), a paramilitary entity created by the Nationalist Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP) in 1920. Massacres of local peoples and the implementation of imperial protectorates administered by the Galactic Empire also mirror that seen throughout Europe during the Second World War. Their best-known weapon is the iconic Death Star, a Moon-sized space platform that can destroy entire planets.

In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, the fall of the Galactic Republic and its replacement by the Galactic Empire – as depicted in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; – recall the historic fall of the Roman Republic and its replacement by the Roman Empire headed by Augustus.

The term &quot;galactic empire&quot; has, perhaps because of association with the Empire from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, gained a pejorative meaning.

===Foundation and CoDominium===
In contrast to Star Wars, the galactic empires from the &quot;Foundation&quot; universe and the &quot;CoDominium&quot; universe are relatively benign organizations. Much of the plot of the &quot;Foundation&quot; series, authored by Isaac Asimov, revolves around who can best and most quickly revive the fallen galactic empire; it is taken for granted that this is a positive and worthy aim. In writer Jerry Pournelle&#x27;s &quot;CoDominium&quot; series, members of the empire often work to maintain the best interests of humanity despite efforts by violent political extremists to pursue their own ends.

Galactic empires are in many cases consciously modeled on historical Earth-bound empires. Asimov stated explicitly that the Galactic Empire whose fall is depicted in his &quot;Foundation&quot; books is also modeled on the Roman Empire, with the author taking direct inspiration from the historical writings of Edward Gibbon, even to the point of basing some individual characters on historical figures. Specifically, &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;, which is set on Earth – a poor and backward province of the Galactic Empire – is modeled on Roman-ruled Judea in the 1st century AD. Asimov&#x27;s Earth – like the historical Judea – is sharply polarized between those who accept the Imperial authority and the fanatic &quot;Zealots&quot; who hatch violent plots of bloody rebellion and are the book&#x27;s clear villains.

&quot;Foundation&quot; is depicted as having started life as a Foundation of scholars, taking up just one city on one faraway planet and setting up a modest municipal government headed, naturally, by a Mayor. Through a centuries-long series of developments which are the main subject matter of the Foundation Series, the Foundation gains enormous power and territory and comes to rule virtually as many stellar systems as the earlier fallen Empire - but continues to call itself &quot;Foundation&quot; rather than &quot;Empire&quot;, and its ruler - though wielding as much power as any Emperor - retains the title of &quot;Mayor&quot;.

===Dominic Flandry===
Writer Poul Anderson makes the point that the declining empire depicted in his &quot;Dominic Flandry&quot; series does not span the entire galaxy but only a fraction of one of its spiral arms. Nevertheless, the institution is vast beyond a regular human&#x27;s ability to truly comprehend, and it is in the process of collapsing under its own weight. This series also consciously compares its imperial organization with the Roman Empire, to the point of tracing out the space equivalents of the Roman &#x27;Principate&#x27; and &#x27;Dominate&#x27; phases.

===Dune===
The universe established in Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; once again recalls the Holy Roman Empire, as well as the Byzantine and Islamic empires, especially given the role of hitherto disregarded desert-dwellers who, due to a powerful new religion, expand to topple an old empire and build a new one. For example, the Egyptian-Canadian commentator Khalid M. Baheyeldin has enumerated the obviously Islamic concepts and references appearing in &quot;Dune&quot; to the level of finding multiple similarities between the career of Herbert&#x27;s Paul Atreides and that of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, the empire&#x27;s power is held within three organizations: the Imperial family; the Landsraad, representing the nobility; and the Spacing Guild, an interstellar travel monopoly.

===Warhammer 40,000===
Another notable example of a galactic empire is the Imperium of Man from the Warhammer 40,000 universe, which is a feudal theocratic industrial and militaristic totalitarian regime (nominally an absolute monarchy) that does in fact span almost the entirety of the Milky Way Galaxy. Despite massive strength, the institution&#x27;s territories are constantly at risk due to unending conflicts with various alien races and rebel factions. The Imperium of Man is managed by a vast bureaucracy, ranging from the High Lords of Terra to various mostly-autonomous planetary governors (they can do whatever they like so long as they pay taxes), all of whom govern the Imperium&#x27;s territories on behalf of the comatose God-Emperor. It is supported by several organisations, such as the Ecclesiarchy, its state church; and the Adeptus Mechanicus, which produces most of its military equipment, which also operate independently from each other and the central Terran government.

===Others===
In the final arc of the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga series by Naoko Takeuchi, a fictional organization called Shadow Galactica has established an empire all over the Milky Way. Shadow Galactica is stealing &quot;starseeds&quot;, the essence of sentient life in the galaxy. Its members come from different Star Systems and Sailor Galaxia, the self-proclaimed &quot;Golden Queen of Shadow Galactica&quot;, has built her palace around the Galaxy Cauldron, the birthplace of all life in the Milky Way located in Galactic Center.

Bertram Chandler wrote two interstellar series – one featuring a Galactic Empire ruled by a series of non-hereditary Empresses while the other has a Republican Galactic Federation. Chandler&#x27;s Empire and Federation, both relatively benign, have much in common – both covering the same volume of space, having much the same kind of Space Navy and both having the same commercial spaceflight company called &quot;The Dog Star Line&quot;, suggesting that these are two alternate history timelines which branched off from the same original space travelling culture.

In Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s Hainish Cycle, the interstellar entity known as &quot;The League of All Worlds&quot; and later as &quot;The Ekumen&quot; is in possession of the &#x27;ansible&#x27; (a tachyonic device). Technology makes possible instantaneous interstellar communications, and the ability to send instantaneous unmanned ships carrying bombs to another planet is exploited as well. However, living beings cannot survive such travel, and thus humans are limited to space exploration at relativistic speeds. Correspondingly, this organization, despite on occasion waging war across interstellar distances, ends up being looser than a true empire.

Author Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Starways Congress&quot;, an organization featured in the work &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; (the follow-up to &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;), similarly relies on the ansible. Yet it is more authoritarian and less benevolent than Le Guin&#x27;s creation. Much of the story-line of the book and its sequels involves attempts to avoid interstellar bloodshed despite difficult circumstances.

<text>The Bushongo are an ethnic group from the Congo River and surrounding areas. The creator god (or chembe) in Bushongo religion is called Bumba. Other names for him include M&#x27;Bombo and M&#x27;Bomba. He is said to have originally existed alone in darkness, in a universe consisting of nothing but primordial water. M&#x27;Bombo was said to appear like a gigantic man in form and white in colour. The creation took place when he vomited the sun, moon, animals and then humanity.

== Modern influence ==
David Adams Leeming in The World of Myth, states:&quot;The dominant theme in this myth is that of creation out of the male principle. Bumba [M&#x27;Bombo]&#x27;s vomiting reminds us of the Egyptian High God&#x27;s creation by spitting and seed spilling. The absence of the female principle here suggests a patrilineal culture. The fact that Bumba [M&#x27;Bombo] is white suggests that this is a late myth, affected, like so much African mythology, by the presence of the white race in colonial Africa.&quot; Thus Bushongo religion has been heavily influenced by modern cultures. However, as traditional African mythology and the bulk of indigenous civilizations worldwide do not associate the colour white with any particular race, it is definitely untouched by Europeans or the &quot;white&quot; race. The idea that white symbolises Europeans is a relatively recent development in Europe.

== Cosmology ==
According to the Bushongo creation myth, the only thing that existed in the world originally was a god named M&#x27;Bombo. Having become ill, M&#x27;Bombo vomited: out the sun, the moon, the stars, various animals and Tsetse the lightning. Finally, M&#x27;Bombo vomited out humans. The animals that M&#x27;Bombo had vomited out earlier created other animals.

The three sons of M&#x27;Bombo attempted to finish the creation of the world. The first, Nyonye Ngana, made white ants but was not equal to the task and died as a result. The ants, however, thankful for life, went searching for black earth and covered the barren sands to bury and honour their creator. Chonganda, the second son, brought forth a plant from which all other plants in the world are descended. The third son, Chedi Bumba, only succeeded in creating the bird called the kite. 

Tsetse the lightning, proved to be a trouble-maker. Consequently, M&#x27;Bombo chased her into the sky, leaving mankind without fire until he later showed people how to draw fire out of trees.

When the work of creation was completed, M&#x27;Bombo walked through the villages and said to the people, &quot;Behold these wonders, they belong to you&quot;

It runs from U.S. Route 1/9 (US 1-9) in Ridgefield east down the New Jersey Palisades to end at County Route 505 (CR 505, River Road) at the Hudson River in Edgewater, forming a “wavy” path. The route is a two- to four-lane undivided highway its entire length, passing mostly through wooded residential neighborhoods. The route passes under Route 63 in Palisades Park, with access to that route provided by Bergen Boulevard, and intersects the southern terminus of Route 67 in Fort Lee.

The route was designated in 1916 as part of pre-1927 Route 10, which was to run from Paterson east to the terminal of the Fort Lee Ferry in Edgewater, using the Paterson and Hackensack Turnpike between Paterson and Hackensack, the Bergen Turnpike from Hackensack to Ridgefield, and a new alignment between Ridgefield and Edgewater. In 1927, the route was renumbered to Route 5, with initial plans to build a new alignment for the route between Ridgefield and Little Ferry. Route 5 was also planned to run concurrent with Route 6 (now US 46) between Paterson and Ridgefield. However, the plans were modified in 1929 to build Route 6 on a new alignment and have Route 5 end at Route 1 (now US 1/9) in Ridgefield. The former alignment was designated as Route 10N with maintenance eventually turned over to the county. The eastern terminus of Route 5 was moved to its current location by the 2000s. In 2007, construction began to improve the route in Palisades Park by replacing bridges and widening the road, with work completed in late 2009.

==Route description==

Route 5 begins at an intersection with US 1-9 (North Broad Avenue) in Ridgefield, heading east as a two-lane undivided road through residential areas. It crosses CR 31 (Maple Avenue) and enters Palisades Park. In Palisades Park, the road passes over Delia Avenue and turns south as it heads through wooded residential neighborhoods. Route 5 passes under Route 63 and enters Fort Lee, where the route immediately intersects Bergen Boulevard, which provides access to Route 63. From there, the road heads east through wooded neighborhoods before turning north onto Glen Road.
Route 5 comes to an intersection with County Route 29 (Anderson Avenue) and County Route 54 (Central Boulevard), where the route continues east on Central Boulevard as a four-lane undivided road through inhabited areas. It meets the southern terminus of Route 67 (Palisade Avenue) and continues south along that road. After of following Palisade Avenue, Route 5 makes a left turn onto a two-lane road, with County Route 27 continuing south on Palisade Avenue. The route descends the New Jersey Palisades on a winding road with hairpin turns, crossing into Edgewater. In Edgewater, the road briefly heads through commercial areas before ending at CR 505 (River Road) along the Hudson River.

==History==

Pre-1927 Route 10 was legislated in 1916 to run from Paterson east by way of Hackensack and Ridgefield to the Public Service Railway&#x27;s Fort Lee Ferry at Edgewater. From Paterson it used the existing Paterson and Hackensack Turnpike (Market Street and Essex Street, legislated in 1815) to Hackensack and the Bergen Turnpike (Hudson Street) to Ridgefield. Rather than use existing roads from Ridgefield down the Palisades to Edgewater, a whole new route was surveyed with better grades. This road was built by 1922. At its east end, Route 10 ran south several blocks on River Road to the ferry, just south of Dempsey Avenue. In Ridgefield, Broad Avenue was used to get between the new alignment and Bergen Turnpike.

In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 10 was renumbered to Route 5. Plans at the time were to build a new alignment from east of Ridgefield to Little Ferry southeast of Hackensack and form Route S5 (now locally maintained) along the old road from Little Ferry to Ridgefield. The new Route 6 would share the alignment of Route 5 from Paterson to west of Hackensack, where it would turn southeast onto a new alignment to Little Ferry, then run with Route 5 again to east of Ridgefield and split onto its own alignment to the George Washington Bridge.

In 1929, the routes were redefined. Route 6 would be a completely new alignment from Paterson to the George Washington Bridge, and Route 5 would only run east from Route 1 (Broad Avenue, now US 1/9) in Ridgefield. The alignment of Route 10 west of Ridgefield was designated Route 10N until it was eventually turned over to the county. Route 5 retained its routing in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. By the 2000s, the section of Route 5 along River Road to the former ferry was removed. In June 2007, construction began on a $24.6 million project to improve the route through Palisades Park. This project, which was completed in late 2009, involved the replacement of the bridge over Delia Boulevard, the removal of a bridge over an abandoned rail line, and the widening of the two-lane road to include a shoulder.

<text>The Tumbuka are an ethnic group living in Malawi, Zambia, and Tanzania. In Tumbuka mythology, Chiuta (meaning &quot;Great Bow&quot;) is the Supreme Creator and is symbolised in the sky by the rainbow.

Tumbuka has many myths that constitute part of the Tumbuka cultural heritage. These myths, told around fires at night, often to the accompaniment of drumming and choral responses, aim to teach children moral behavior and to entertain.

Most of these myths have been weakened or lost over time, but many still remain; these &quot;vidokoni&quot; (stories) have a moral behind them.

There are three animals mentioned more than any others in Tumbuka mythology and these are &quot;fulu&quot; (tortoise), &quot;kalulu&quot; (hare), and &quot;chimbwi&quot; (hyena). Fulu is considered the wisest animal, chimbwe the villain, and kalulu the clever trickster and manipulator who can only be defeated by fulu.

== Deities ==

=== Chiuta ===
Chiuta, is the supreme deity figure in the traditional religions of the Tumbuka people, who resides in present-day Malawi. Chiuta is also sometimes known by the following names: Mulengi, Mwenco, and Wamtatakuya.

Chiuta is omnipresent, though shapeless. Though prayers can be made directly to Chiuta, ancestors and spirits play a large part in determining whether these prayers would be fulfilled. Offerings and appeals to ancestors and spirits can help sway their favors. Chiuta is associated with several natural phenomena that occurs from the sky, such as rain and thunderstorm.

== Legends ==

=== Creation of the universe ===
In the beginning, it is said that only earth and Chiuta existed. The earth was empty, and there was no body of water in its surface. Then Chiuta summoned the clouds, rain, and lightning to fall on earth. Later, Chiuta also went down to earth, followed by the first humans and all the animals.

=== Origin of death ===
There are two versions of the origins of death associated with Chiuta. According to Lynch and Roberts (2010), the first version involved a chameleon and lizard. The chameleon was supposed to bring a message to humans, that when they die, they would be reincarnated. On the other hand, the lizard&#x27;s message would instead tell humans that their deaths are permanent. Unfortunately, the lizard was faster than the chameleon, and thus death became a permanent state.

In the second version, told by Harvey (2005), the connection between the heavens, represented by the sky, and earth was cut when the humans discovered fire. Since all animals feared what the humans could do, they asked for Chiuta&#x27;s help. Chiuta settled the issue, and tired from the conflict, decided to retreat to heavens and sever the connection between earth and heaven.

<doc id="99526" wikidata="Q821468" url="?curid=99526" title="New Jersey Route 7">
<text>Route 7 is a state highway in the northern part of New Jersey in the United States. It has two sections, an east–west alignment running from U.S. Route 1/9 Truck in Jersey City to the Passaic River in Belleville, and a north–south alignment running from the Newark/Belleville to the Nutley/Clifton border. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) lists Route 7 as a single north–south highway with a small gap between the alignments. The entire highway has a combined length of .

The southern section of Route 7, which runs from Jersey City west-northwest to Belleville, passes through industrial areas, the New Jersey Meadowlands, Arlington Memorial Park, and some residential and business areas. West of the interchange with County Route 508 in Kearny, Route 7 is the Belleville Turnpike, a historic road created in 1759. The northern section of Route 7 runs north through residential and business areas of Belleville and Nutley into Clifton, where it turns west and crosses back into Nutley, briefly turning to the north to come to its northern terminus. A portion of the route in Nutley is municipally maintained while the portion within Clifton is maintained by Passaic County. The two separate sections of Route 7 are linked by County Route 506 (Rutgers Street) in Belleville, which is signed as Route 7 despite the fact it is not officially part of the route. There is inconsistency between the official NJDOT diagram and what is signed on the road; the signage suggests that Route 7 is really one continuous route that also extends even further north to Route 3 via Kingsland Road and Cathedral Ave, and many navigation systems also indicate this. However, the NJDOT has not updated the definition of Route 7 past a 2-segment highway.

Route 7 was established in 1927 to run from Jersey City to Paterson, replacing pre-1927 Route 11 between Belleville and Paterson. The routing was amended in 1929 to head to Route 3 in Wallington and was extended north to Route 6 (now U.S. Route 46) in East Paterson in 1949. In 1953, the route was modified to follow its current alignment.

==Route description==

===Southern segment===

The first segment of Route 7 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 1-9 Truck and County Route 645 (Charlotte Avenue) in Jersey City, Hudson County, heading to the west on a four-lane highway that is signed east–west. The route crosses the Hackensack River on the Wittpenn Bridge parallel to Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Passaic and Harsimus Line into Kearny. Route 7 interchanges with County Route 659 (Fish House Road) and widens to a six-lane divided highway. The route then passes by industrial areas and a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad yard before it passes over NJ Transit&#x27;s Morris &amp; Essex Lines and reaches an interchange with County Route 508. Past this interchange, Route 7 becomes the four-lane, divided Belleville Turnpike, with the eastern end of the Newark Turnpike running in the division between the two sides of Route 7. It then becomes an undivided two-lane road, heading northwest, narrowing to two lanes before it crosses under Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor and passes through the New Jersey Meadowlands. The route crosses under the Eastern Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) and then the Western Spur of the turnpike a short distance later before passing over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Boonton Line.
Route 7 continues northwest, widens, with a painted median, as it passes through two large cemeteries on the border of Hudson County (Kearny) to the south and Bergen County (North Arlington) to the north, though the route itself is signed north–south along that border.

After an intersection with Schuyler Avenue (which runs as County Route 507 to the south of Route 7 and County Route 130 to the north of Route 7), the road turns NNW, narrowing again to two lanes undivided. In this portion of the route, it had a concurrency with County Route 507 (both Bergen and Hudson counties). It keeps this configuration for about a half mile, as it still runs along the Kearny/North Arlington border. At that point, it meets the southern terminus of Route 17 (Ridge Road) and the northern terminus of County Route 697 (Kearny Avenue).

Past this intersection, County Route 507 turns away from Route 7, becoming concurrent with Route 17. by heading north on River Road, while Route 7 continues along Belleville Turnpike for another half mile, Route 7 continues another half mile west, crossing the Passaic River on a lift bridge, known as the Belleville Turnpike Bridge or Rutgers Street Bridge, into Belleville, Essex County, where the local street name changes from Belleville Turnpike to Rutgers Street. The first section of Route 7 ends underneath the Route 21 freeway, where it continues as County Route 506.

===Gap in the route===

The intersection of Main St and Rutgers Street in Belleville forms the end of one section of Route 7 (signed north, directionally west). Rutgers Street is named for Colonel Henry Rutgers, an American Revolutionary War hero and benefactor of what is now Rutgers University. For its entire length, Rutgers carries County Route 506, which ends, like Rutgers Street itself, at the Rutgers Street Bridge.

Prior to turning onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 runs along Washington Street concurrent with the northern section of Route 7. Though the northern section of Route 7 begins a few blocks south, it is not readily recognized (minimal signing). As CR-506 runs concurrently with it here, and then turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges the gap between the two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is often viewed as if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, even though it is part of the main route.

Rutgers&#x27; identity has become so closely aligned with Route 7, that though it is not officially part of Route 7, Rutgers, from Washington Avenue to Main Street, is signed as if it is part of Route 7.

=== Northern section ===
The second section of Route 7, designated a north–south road, heads north on Washington Avenue from the Second River crossing on the Newark/Belleville border, passing through a business district. The route intersects County Route 506 (Belleville Avenue), and that county route then forms a concurrency with Route 7 along the next block of Washington Avenue, to the intersection with Rutgers Street. At that point, County Route 506 heads to the east, ending at the intersection of Main Street, Rutgers Street, and bridge to Belleville (which is also the other section of Route 7).
Route 7 is not signed on Washington Avenue between the Second River bridge and Rutgers Street, except on some overhead signs suspended from traffic signals.

From the Rutgers Street intersection, Route 7 continues along Washington Avenue for about a mile and a half before reaching Nutley, still continuing on Washington Avenue into Nutley. The road crosses Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Newark Industrial Track line at an intersection with County Route 648 (Centre Street). At the intersection with County Route 646 (Park Avenue), Route 7 turns into a municipally maintained road and enters a more residential area. Upon intersecting County Route 606 (Kingsland Road), Route 7 crosses into Clifton, Passaic County and heads to the west on county-maintained Kingsland Street signed east–west. Kingsland, carrying Route 7, crosses back into Nutley, regaining state maintenance. When Kingsland becomes County Route 644 at the intersection with Cathedral Avenue, Route 7 turns north from Kingsland onto Cathedral Avenue and comes to its terminus at Orange Street in Nutley. However, signage continues to indicate Route 7 up to the terminus of Cathedral Avenue at interchange with Route 3 at the intersection of Cathedral Avenue, Passaic Avenue, and Ward Avenue. Per NJDOT traffic regulations, the portion of Cathedral Avenue and Passaic Avenue within the vicinity of the Route 3 interchange in Clifton is under state jurisdiction.

==History==
The Belleville Turnpike, which is the majority of the southern portion of Route 7, was created in 1759 as a turnpike made out of cedar logs. This road was chartered in 1808. It served as a part of the Underground Railroad route for escaped slaves to get to Jersey City. The road west of modern County Route 508 was later incorporated into the William Penn Highway, which ran from Jersey City to Pittsburgh, PA.
The northern segment of Route 7 was originally a part of pre-1927 Route 11, which was legislated in 1917 to run from Newark to Paterson. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 7 was designated to run from Jersey City to Paterson, replacing pre-1927 Route 11 between Belleville and Paterson.

In 1929, the routing was amended to run from Route 25 (now U.S. Route 1/9 Truck) in Jersey City to Route 3 in Wallington. Route 7 was extended north in 1949 to continue to Route 6 (now U.S. Route 46) in East Paterson (now Elmwood Park).
In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 7 was legislated onto its current alignment, with the northern terminus moved to the Nutley/Clifton border. The route was also realigned to head south on Washington Avenue between the Newark border and Rutgers Street in Belleville on what was Route 11N, a remnant of pre-1927 Route 11, making Route 7 discontinuous. County Route 506 used to follow the southern portion of Route 7 but has been truncated to the intersection with Routes 7 and 21 in Belleville.

<text>Route 10 is a state highway in the northern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs from an intersection of US 46 in Roxbury, Morris County, east to Prospect Avenue / Mt Pleasant Avenue (CR 577 / CR 677) in West Orange, Essex County. Route 10 is a major route through northern New Jersey that runs through Ledgewood, East Hanover, and Livingston. It is a four-lane highway for most of its length with the exception of the easternmost part of the route. Route 10 features intersections and interchanges with many major roads including Route 53 and US 202 in Morris Plains and I-287 in Hanover.

Route 10 was designated in 1927 to run from Jersey City to Dover, following the former Newark and Mount Pleasant Turnpike west of Newark. The route continued east from its present-day routing on current County Route 577, Park Avenue, CR 508, and Route 7 to end at US 1/9 at the Tonnele Circle. An alignment of Route 10 farther to the north of its current alignment in Essex County was proposed in 1952; however, it was never constructed with the route being designated to its present alignment a year later. Since 1953, Route 10 has seen improvements that eliminated the Ledgewood Circle at the western terminus in 1998 and improved safety along the portion of the route in Hanover and East Hanover townships in the mid-2000s.

==Route description==
Route 10 begins at the intersection of US 46 in the Ledgewood section of Roxbury, Morris County at the former Ledgewood Circle, heading to the southeast on a four-lane divided highway with some jughandles. The road passes by The Shops at Ledgewood Commons, the Roxbury Mall, and many other businesses, also crossing the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad&#x27;s High Bridge Branch. The route crosses the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad&#x27;s Chester Branch before it enters Randolph, where the road becomes less commercial in nature and passes Randolph Lake, reaching an interchange with Sussex Turnpike (CR 617). Past this interchange, Route 10 crosses over forested Mine Hill. The route crosses the intersection of Dover-Chester Road (CR 513) and passes north of the County College of Morris past that intersection, with suburban development becoming more frequent again. Route 10 widens to six lanes and then runs through the southwestern corner of Denville before heading into the Mount Tabor section of Parsippany.

The route then forms the border between Parsippany–Troy Hills to the north and Morris Plains to the south, passing over NJ Transit&#x27;s Morristown Line before coming to an interchange with Route 53 and crossing US 202. The route fully enters Parsippany again before crossing into Hanover, coming to an interchange with Dryden Way, where the route widens to eight lanes. Past Dryden Way, Route 10 features an interchange with I-287 and narrows to four lanes. The road heads through the Whippany section of Hanover, where it has an interchange with Parsippany Road (County Route 511) and crosses the Morristown and Erie Railway&#x27;s Whippany Line west of the Whippany Railway Museum. Route 10 enters East Hanover at the bridge over Whippany Brook. Along Route 10 in East Hanover, the road passes several businesses.

Route 10 crosses the Passaic River into Livingston, Essex County, where it becomes Mt. Pleasant Avenue. The route comes to the Livingston Circle, a realigned traffic circle, in the community of Morehousetown, with West Northfield Road (CR 508) and Eisenhower Parkway (CR 609). Past this traffic circle, the divided highway becomes a four-lane undivided road with some businesses and homes along the road. The route crosses the intersection of Livingston Avenue (CR 527) and narrows to two lanes a short distance past that intersection. The route enters West Orange at the point it crosses Nance Road. In West Orange, Route 10 ends at the intersection of Prospect Avenue where the radio station 1560 WFME&#x27;s studios and 94.7 WXBK&#x27;s transmitter facilities are located. At this intersection, CR 577 heads east on Mt. Pleasant Avenue and north on Prospect Avenue while CR 677 (signed as CR 577 Spur) heads south on Prospect Avenue.

==History==

Route 10 roughly follows a portion of an old Lenape Trail from the Passaic River to Whippany. The Newark and Mount Pleasant Turnpike was established along the present-day alignment of Route 10 east of Dover on March 12, 1806, existing as a turnpike until before 1833.
Route 10 was designated in 1927 to run from Jersey City west to Route 6 (now US 46) west of Dover, passing through Newark. This routing of Route 10 followed its current alignment and ran east along present-day CR 577, Mt Pleasant Avenue, and Park Avenue to Newark, where it followed CR 508 and Route 7 to US 1/9 at the Tonnele Circle in Jersey City. By 1930, the road&#x27;s western terminus had been moved to bypass Dover to terminate at Ledgewood. The earliest completed sections of an upgraded highway were completed from Livingston Circle to Whippany, with the bridge over the Passaic River completed in 1930. From there the road was extended to Route 53 and finished at Ledgewood. In Essex County, the route that the highway would be constructed along was contentious from the start. In 1930 and 1931, three proposals for arteries were presented, all paralleling existing railroads. Though demands to decide a route and begin construction extended to at least 1937, no highway was ever constructed, and the road terminated at West Orange.

To solve this issue, a new route for Route 10 was designated in 1952 to run along a new, never-built alignment farther to the north, running through Belleville, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, Montclair, West Orange, and along the Livingston/Roseland border, roughly along much of the routing of present-day CR 611 (Eagle Rock Avenue), and following its current alignment through Morris County to Ledgewood. A spur of the route was also planned in 1952 to run from Montclair south to Orange. A year later, in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 10 was defined onto its current alignment, with its eastern terminus moved to Prospect Avenue in West Orange. In 1998, the Ledgewood Circle at the western terminus of the route was replaced with a signalized T-intersection. In the mid-2000s, an $11.5 million project was undertaken to improve safety on the portion of Route 10 in Hanover and East Hanover Townships by widening existing lanes and adding turning lanes to the road.

Joint Resolution No. 3, page 844, of the 160th Legislature (1936) designated Route 10 as the American Legion Memorial Highway in honor of the services of the members of the American Legion in World War I.

<text>Route 13 is a short state highway in the communities of Point Pleasant and Bay Head, New Jersey, both of which are in Ocean County. The route consists of the Lovelandtown Bridge, a vertical-lift bridge over the Point Pleasant Canal, and a part of Bridge Avenue, which is mostly maintained by the county as County Route 632 (CR 632). The route was unsigned until new mileposts were installed in 2017. Route 13 was designated in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering as a re-designation of Route 13E from Hollywood Boulevard to Bay Avenue.

The route was first assigned in 1938, when the state took over maintenance of the fifth segment of Ocean County Route 13 built in 1929, intending it to reach old Route 37 (now part of Route 35) in Bay Head from Beaver Dam Road, a distance of . The takeover did not reach that point, and the bridge and its approaches count for of the intended length. The original bridge collapsed in 1962, and a temporary structure was erected later that year. Planning for a permanent replacement bridge continued for several years until construction finally began in 1970. This structure opened in 1972, but closed immediately afterward due to a failure of the lift mechanism, which was fixed by the end of the year. In late 2004, the bridge and its approaches received a rehabilitation.

==Route description==

Route 13 begins at an intersection where CR 632 meets Hollywood Boulevard in Point Pleasant. There, the state-maintenance begins. The route heads eastward along Bridge Avenue, passing to the south of local businesses and to the north of local residences. There, Route 13 begins a curve to the northeast onto the Lovelandtown Bridge approach, passing a marina before reaching the Point Pleasant Canal (part of the Intracoastal Waterway) and heading onto a lift bridge called the Lovelandtown Bridge. After crossing the canal, Route 13 parallels Elm Avenue for a short distance before turning away to the southeast. The route heads into downtown Bay Head, where it reaches an intersection with Bay Avenue, which is its eastern terminus. CR 632 continues eastward to Route 35. Route 13 is concurrent with CR 632 for its entire length.

==History==
===Designation===

Originally, the Lovelandtown Bridge was constructed in 1929 to create a continuous route along Bridge Avenue. Route 13 originated as an alignment of Ocean County Route 13-E, a highway maintained by the county. In 1938, the state legislated a takeover of the fifth segment of the county route, a portion of highway from old Route 37 (now part of Route 35) at Bay Head to an intersection with Beaver Dam Road, including the Lovelandtown Bridge. The route was to be long, and the designation came into effect on July 2, 1938. However, the extension to Route 37 was never constructed. In the 1953 renumbering, the state dropped the suffix and renumbered the bridge and its approaches as Route 13. (Incidentally, the portion of Route 37 within Bay Head—running from Point Pleasant to Seaside Heights—was renumbered as Route 35 during the same highway renumbering.)

=== Lovelandtown Bridge rebuild===
==== Collapse and demands for new bridge (1962–1964) ====

By 1960, the usefulness of the Lovelandtown Bridge came into question. The New Jersey State Highway Department felt that the bridge was structurally safe and able to support up to 20 tons (18.14 tonnes). However, local officials felt the bridge was unsafe, especially for vehicles such as school buses. Additionally, the bridge, which was supported by wooden pilings, was starting to fail and erode. The expected failure occurred during the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962 on March 5, when the storm and tides on the Intracostal Waterway wiped out a section of the bridge. A temporary structure to replace the bridge opened in May 1962.

In the meantime, proposals were made for a permanent replacement structure. Early proposals noted the bridge would take about three months to rebuild. Point Pleasant Police Chief William Beecroft, who voiced concerns about the integrity of the bridge in 1960 and 1962, proposed a new tunnel across the Intracoastal Waterway to replace the Route 88 and Route 13 bridges. Beecroft speculated that the new tunnel would be cheaper to build in the long run and make things easier for emergency vehicles who would not have to deal with drawbridges. The State Highway Department considered a new tunnel for Route 13, but quickly discarded the idea by October due to excessive costs, though Beecroft would bring it up again as an option if there were a hearing.

In November 1962, the State Highway Department made plans to build a new high fixed structure over the waterway. However, this plan was opposed by multiple agencies and individuals because yachts would be unable to use the waterway with a fixed structure. One of these was Assemblyman William T. Hiering, a Republican from Ocean County who asked the United States Army Corps of Engineers to hold a public hearing on such a bridge; this hearing would occur on December 27. However, the State Highway Department also supported an option for a high drawbridge that would accommodate yacht users and only have to be opened once in a while. Such a plan would cost about $2 million.

By February 1964, the State Highway Department switched its plan to a vertical-lift bridge. This new bridge would be able to open to as high as in the air and allow room for yachts to go through. The delay in action by the Highway Department was being slammed by the borough of Point Pleasant by December 1964. Dr. Ronald V. Crescenzo, one of the members of the borough council wanted a bus ban over the replaced structure until a new one could be built. The borough also wanted to be absolved of any responsibility and liability in case of another structural failure. They did, however, support a new vertical-lift bridge with the high lift that could raise to in the air.

==== Added pressure (1965–1966) ====

More complaints came from higher officials in September 1965, when a resident of Fair Lawn drove off the temporary Lovelandtown Bridge and died. The car crashed through the wooden railings of the bridge and landed in the canal below. The driver&#x27;s death sparked the attention of State Senator Wayne Dumont and Point Pleasant Mayor Walter B. Brown; they deemed the bridge a traffic hazard and pressured Governor Richard J. Hughes to speed up construction. Dumont also claimed that the previous governor&#x27;s administration provided money for the new bridge. However, the State Highway Department claimed that no money was ever allocated for such use.

In December 1965, the borough of Point Pleasant noted that meetings between them, Ocean County and the State Highway Department would be conducted on December 9 or December 16, to discuss a new Lovelandtown Bridge. Chief Beecroft, who previously wanted a tunnel crossing, noted buses were taken off the temporary structure for safety. By December 3, Point Pleasant announced that the meeting would take place on December 16.

In January 1966, the New Jersey State Conservation Department approved the plans of the State Highway Department for the construction of a new Lovelandtown Bridge. This new bridge would need a horizontal clearance and a vertical clearance of to help navigation through the canal. Bridge Avenue would be moved north for the new bridge, with the construction of a new alignment. This would help eliminate curves that were considered dangerous to the old bridge. However, the bridge was still subject to the approval of a United States Engineer in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. These plans reached the United States Army Corps of Engineers in April 1966, when they announced openings for anyone who had opposition to the project. By the deadline of May 16, no objections were filed with the engineers on the new bridge.

In July 1966, the state announced that they were ready to begin construction of a new Lovelandtown Bridge, but they would have to wait until the Army Corps of Engineers announced their full approval of the project. The state felt that a new bridge would not be finished until 1968, but would at least get approval within a span of four to six weeks. However, the bridge alignment changed in April to have an vertical clearance due to new regulations for future expansion of the canal.

====Design and funding problems (1967–1968)====
However, despite the four to six week timeline, the Army Corps of Engineers did not sign off on the new Lovelandtown Bridge until January 26, 1967. The new bridge would have a vertical clearance of when closed and when raised. The span would be wide for boats and barges to clear. The newly-renamed New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) said design, planning and construction would take about 18 months. Mayor Brown noted that he was happy and was willing to even bring his shovel.

Survey work by the Army Corps of Engineers began in July 1967, for the design of the new bridge over the waterway. NJDOT also hired a New York firm to do the survey work. Less than a month later, the mechanisms to help open the Lovelandtown Bridge to marine traffic broke on August 16, resulting in a seven-hour closure of the bridge and several days of repairs. The Army Corps completed their survey work in the canal in November 1967.

By December 1967, NJDOT moved test borings to the Bureau of Navigation offices to make plans for the new Lovelandtown Bridge ones. The offices would end up being relocated as part of the construction of the new bridge, due to be finished in 1971. The Board of Adjustment chair for the borough of Point Pleasant noted that they should pressure the state to move their schedule up in response to the collapse of the Silver Bridge in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. However, the state announced that they did move their timeline up and expected a replacement to be finished now in 1970, since design problems were avoided during that period. The state also noted that the new bridge would require the condemnation of as many as 20 houses. Drilling into the Point Pleasant Canal began on January 2, 1968, when NJDOT inserted borings for new bridge supports.

However, by September 1968, Point Pleasant wanted to know why the $2 million set aside by the state for construction of the new bridge had been shifted to help facilitate the Aldene Plan in Union County. The new bridge, now costing $4 million (1968 USD), no longer was in the funding for the state. The borough demanded an answer from Governor Hughes, which did not come with answers. Hughes noted that if the state voters passed a new bond issue, the Lovelandtown Bridge would be a top priority. This was in direct conflict with a promise by the State Highway Department in 1966, that money for the new bridge would be non-reliant on a bond issue or other strings. The borough demanded that Commissioner David Goldberg meet with borough officials to get the missing answers.

That meeting would be scheduled for October 8, 1968, at the offices for Goldberg in Trenton, with Mayor Brown heading out to discuss the problems. Brown noted to the press that he wanted $4 million of $114 million earmarked for new railcars as part of the Aldene Plan to be shifted to a new bridge. He also noted that multiple members of the State Legislature, including Senator Hiering, along with Benjamin Mabie and John Brown of the Assembly would introduce legislation to help get funding earmarked immediately for the bridge.

Brown&#x27;s attitude changed once the meeting with Goldberg ended, feeling that Goldberg had been unsympathetic to their concerns and problems with the change in funding. Brown told the &quot;Asbury Park Evening Press&quot; that Goldberg gave them a &quot;snow job&quot; and would still force them to rely on the November 5 bond issue of $640 million for transportation work. Mabie, Brown and Hiering noted that they would introduce their response bills once the Legislature reconvened after the election. Goldberg disagreed stating that even if the bond issue failed with the voters, he would have $40 million in funding and the odds of funding would be 5–1 for the project. Mabie, along with Chief Beecroft intended to vote against the bond issue on November 5. Brown, still concerned the bridge was going to fall into the canal again, was refuted by Goldberg who stated it is safe and would close it if he felt it was not.

==== Funding and land acquisition (1968–1969) ====
With the money for the Lovelandtown Bridge construction reliant on passing of the public bond issue, Senator Hiering showed his support for the new bond to help pay for transportation projects. Assemblyman Brown, though not public, opposed the new bond issue. He was concerned that Ocean County would be left out of most of its benefits, and he also felt there was voter discontent. Mabie, however, continued to show his support and optimism for the new bond issue, which passed on November 5, 1968, by 502,415 votes. NJDOT then promised a multitude of projects in Ocean County, including construction on Routes 37 and 72 and the Lovelandtown Bridge.

In January 1969, the New Jersey State Legislature approved to spend $242 million of the new bond issue. $110 million would go to the construction of transportation projects immediately, including the Lovelandtown Bridge. In late January, the state started notifying property owners in the way of the new bridge and approach about the condemnation of their properties. Property owners noted they had 90 days to negotiate with the state about proper return values. The &quot;Asbury Park Evening Press&quot; noted that nine of the properties were on Partridge Run and the remaining 11 would be west of the canal.

However, Goldberg announced to Ocean County officials that there would be more delays in all projects besides the widening of Route 37 through Toms River until 1970. Despite the report by Goldberg, Assemblyman Brown noted in March 1969 that NJDOT was about ready to announce the advertisement for bids on a new bridge. Brown noted that Goldberg was saying they were moving forward rapidly on the bridge. By April, tax assessors were working on estimating tax values for the properties to be acquired for the new Lovelandtown alignment. By August, the borough approved to sell land along Bridge Avenue for construction of the new bridge.

In September 1969, the state noted that they would be ready to advertise and accept bids on the new project starting in late October 1969. NJDOT said they could have shovels in the ground during 1969 if all went well, including property acquisition. 15 houses would be demolished by the project, but only one had been acquired by September 18, 1969, the one at 1644 Elm Street, once owned by the Federal Housing Administration and would be sold at auction in Cherry Hill. They felt construction would be finished by mid-1971 after starting in December 1969. This did not go according to plan as NJDOT had to file a condemnation lawsuit against James Duff, a property owner along the west side of the canal that was in the way of the new bridge. The request was made to get a three-man panel to come to an agreement on what Duff would be paid for the property for the future western approach.

Despite the lawsuit, the state did open advertising on bids in late October 1969. Despite the plan for bid announcements on November 26, within a week of the advertising, NJDOT was in court again, this time of a property on Central Avenue in Point Pleasant owned by William Hall. The borough of Point Pleasant was also named as a defendant as they claimed to have a lien on the property Hall owned. The borough of Bay Head noted that they would only lose one property for construction and that their municipality would not be disrupted during construction of the new bridge. However, the project would take over four parcels in total for the new bridge and approaches in Bay Head.

==== Construction (1969–1972) ====
On November 27, 1969, the state announced that they received the lowest bid of $3,344,933.85 (1969 USD) for construction of the new bridge from a joint venture of Mason–Connor, Incorporated of Pennsauken and Thomas Construction of Albany, New York. The new bridge would be long and wide, with new approaches. Bridge Avenue on both sides would be turned into dead ends while the new Bridge Avenue alignment would fork off of Hollywood Avenue in Point Pleasant and Bay Avenue in Bay Head. The two supporting piers of the bridge would be apart from each other. Other bids ranged from $3,386,522–$4,318,141. At that time, NJDOT noted it was studying the low bid and a deal could be made in two weeks.

Point Pleasant announced in December 1969 that they would vacate parts of Central Avenue so construction could begin 
on the new Lovelandtown Bridge. New road would wipe out parts of Central Avenue due to the new alignment. Point Pleasant also asked in January 1970, that the state widen Bridge Avenue at the southern side instead of the northern side of the roadway so that a costly sewer relocation would not be required.

On January 8, 1970, the state announced that they awarded the contract to Mason–Connor and Thompson Construction for the new bridge. The new bridge would have a deadline of December 15, 1971, to be finished, all to the delight of Beecroft, who began the push for the new bridge a decade prior. Residents of both communities visited a display to see the new renderings of the bridge on January 16 at the Point Pleasant Municipal Building. There it was announced that construction would begin on January 26, 1970. By January 29, demolition work begun on the old marine police headquarters as part of property clearing. However, due to the construction, the work was being done at the station in Monmouth Beach. Fearing lack of police patrol, an officer would be stationed on a boat near the old headquarters to help in the cause. They would end up moving to a new facility on Route 35 in April 1971.

William Hall, who the state had sued earlier to acquire some of his property, noted in March 1970, that the contractors were burning fires at the Lovelandtown Bridge construction site and that the smoke from the fires was polluting the air and his property. Hall noted that the fires were being started by burning old rubber tires and the Point Pleasant Borough Attorney noted that it was a violation of code to do so. Beecroft stepped in and asked the contractor to stop, despite the fact that he saw no burning going on at the property and got assurances that it would stop.

Along with the burning of tires, Beecroft also asked NJDOT in March 1970, to ask the contractor to stop routing their dump trucks over the Route 88 bridge in Point Pleasant. A police officer noted the bridge was being used by dump trucks for the contractor weighing as much as 40 tons. The weight would cause the draw leaves of the Route 88 bridge to shift as much as , a dangerous amount of jump for the structure. The main concern of the dirt-loaded dump trucks was more of the safety of schoolchildren crossing the bridge at the same time as the dump trucks. If the bridge opened like that and a child got stuck in the leaves, it would mean immediate amputation. The state asked the trucks to slow down on the bridge to reduce the jump in the bridge, but that was still not enough for Beecroft who was ready to make sure they were flagged down Route 35 to reach the bridge instead. However, by the next week, the bridge was still being used by the dump trucks and any thought of the reroute would require changes to the contract in terms of cost.

By late May, the construction on the pilings for the new bridge piers had begun, with the steel bases constructed. However, work was slowed when the cases for the pilings began to have problems without specially-designed seals to keep them in place. The state and the contractor could not come to terms and instead, extra costs would be added anyway under &quot;time and materials&quot;. The extra seals would add $50,000–$100,000 to the total cost of the project as contracted. The contractor was confident it would be finished near schedule, but no guarantee of on time. Construction did resume in mid-August.

In November, there were complaints by Bay Head residents about the Bridge and Bay Avenue intersection being ripped up and left unpaved due to construction. While NJDOT said new curbs would be installed soon, no paving of the roads could start until the spring of 1971. They noted they would likely do it in April.

By March 1971, the concrete piers for the new bridge were finished and the supports for the deck of the road spans were being installed. The contractor noted that the work was 50 percent complete at that point. Most importantly, the project was still slated to be complete by December 1971. By May, the state closed parts of Bridge Avenue in Point Pleasant to detour traffic off a two-block section. This was needed to help construct the new western approach to the Lovelandtown Bridge and was to remain in place through the end of construction. However, this detour led to complaints from Point Pleasant about the strain it put on Route 88 in pre-summer traffic. The borough demanded that NJDOT adjust things to help lighten the load.

Construction of the first half of the elevator structure for the bridge began by June 1971, with one side finished by the end of the month. Preparations for the other side of the bridge structure were also taking place. The full structure was up by July 15, with construction of the road deck beginning with the bridge in the elevated position.

In October, the borough of Point Pleasant asked for the work to be amended that sidewalks would be built on the new bridge. The new bridge was not designed to have one, just four lanes of traffic. However, the project was now due to be finished in February 1972.

==== Opening and bridge failure (1972–1973) ====
On January 20, 1972, NJDOT announced that the new bridge would open within two weeks (circa February 5) if everything stayed on schedule. However, just four days later, they announced a new delay to the Spring of 1972 due to an issue with the electronic controls for the new bridge. They also said the spokesman from four days prior was incorrect in his announcement about a February 1972 opening. In late March, NJDOT announced they would soon begin testing on the new elevated structure for barge movement. The main control panel had been set in, but some parts had yet to be delivered. Testing continued through April, and NJDOT expected the bridge to open later that month.

On May 10, the state announced that the new bridge would open to traffic after a ceremony on May 23 at 11:00 am. Numerous dignitaries attended the ceremony, including Mayor Valenti of Point Pleasant and Assemblyman Franklin Berry Jr. (R-Ocean). The ceremony commemorated the 12 years of effort to help build a new bridge over the canal. At the same time, local officials used the ceremony to push help for Route 88, which also needed a new span.

As part of the original contract with Mason–Connor and Thompson Construction, the old span would be demolished. However, in mid-June, the state announced the old bridge would be used by motorists once again. The new span needed its opening mechanisms adjusted, resulting in a several week closure of the new span. These adjustments were completed by the end of July. The bridge closed again on August 31, 1972, with the mechanisms requiring more adjustments; detours were conducted through the old bridge. By September 12, it was announced the new span would continue to be closed until the problem of why the bridges was not closing properly was figured out and fixed, resulting in at least another two weeks of delay.

On October 16, 1972, it was announced that NJDOT engineers would have to submit plans by October 25 to fix the broken lift structure. By this point, there was no certain day on when the new bridge would reopen. Engineers announced on October 27 that the bridge was likely failing to close because of lack of weight on the structure. Their proposals were to add weight to the structure to help it close properly. They were not sure how long this project improvement would take, requiring continued use of the old bridge. These problems were finally corrected in December 1972, and the bridge finally reopened to traffic on December 14 at 3:00 pm.

The old Lovelandtown bridge was swung open and process began on demolishing the old structure in January 1973. As demolition continued on the bridge, the United States Coast Guard put out buoys noting the locations of the old pilings for the bridge, located apart from each other just under the surface. The work continued into May on removing the piles from the site of the piers, which had been blasted apart in the demolition process.

=== Modernization ===
The Lovelandtown Bridge and its approaches underwent a rehabilitation in October 2004. The lift mechanism was replaced to allow for quicker and more efficient raising and lowering of the bridge deck. The construction was completed by Carr &amp; Duff Inc., which had received the project in June of that year. NJDOT and Governor James E. McGreevey forwarded $2.4 million (2005 USD) to the company for construction, which was completed by mid-2005. The project was part of the governor&#x27;s &quot;Fix-it First&quot; initiative, which prioritized repairing existing roadway capacity throughout the state over building new capacity.

<text>Route 12 is a state highway located in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, United States. It runs from the Uhlerstown–Frenchtown Bridge at the Delaware River border with Pennsylvania in Frenchtown east to an intersection with U.S. Route 202 (US 202) and Route 31 at the Flemington Circle in Flemington. The route is mostly a two-lane undivided road that passes through rural areas of woodland and farmland. It intersects Route 29 and County Route 513 (CR 513) in Frenchtown, CR 519 in Kingwood Township, CR 579 on the border of Delaware Township and Raritan Township, and CR 523 in Raritan Township.

The route was designated in 1927 to run from Frenchtown to Raritan, Somerset County, running along its current alignment to Flemington and following present-day US 202 between Flemington and Raritan. By the 1940s, US 202 and Route 29 replaced Route 12 east of Flemington, and the route was officially designated to end in Flemington in 1953. There are currently plans to modify or eliminate three traffic circles along the route in Flemington to ease traffic congestion.

==Route description==

Route 12 begins at the Uhlerstown–Frenchtown Bridge over the Delaware River in Frenchtown at the Pennsylvania / New Jersey border, where it connects to Pennsylvania Route 32. The bridge and short portion of its eastern approach is maintained by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission. The route continues through the downtown area of Frenchtown as county-maintained (designated and signed by Hunterdon County as County Route 610) two-lane undivided Bridge Street. Here, it intersects Trenton Avenue which is also the northern terminus of Route 29 before turning north onto Race Street and intersecting the southern terminus of CR 513. Route 12 heads east on Kingwood Avenue and passes through residential areas. The route crosses into Kingwood Township, where it becomes maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation with two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane. As Route 12 climbs into the Hunterdon Plateau, it heads through a mix of woods and farms with intermittent residences, narrowing to one lane in each direction at the top of the plateau before crossing CR 519 in Baptistown.
Route 12 continues southeast through rural areas, crossing the Lockatong Creek before intersecting CR 615, where it becomes the Samuel Hill Highway. A short distance past this intersection, the route briefly passes through the southern corner of Franklin Township before entering Delaware Township. Here, the road crosses Wickecheoke Creek before coming to an intersection with CR 579. Past this intersection, Route 12 enters Raritan Township, where it continues through rural areas with some residences. The residential development along the road increases before it reaches the Dvoor&#x27;s Circle (a traffic circle) with CR 523. Past the traffic circle, the route crosses a small stream and enters Flemington. Here, Route 12 passes businesses and heads south of a park and ride lot serving Trans-Bridge Lines buses before crossing the Black River and Western Railroad and coming to the Main Street Circle, a modern-designed roundabout, where it intersects CR 611 and Reaville Avenue. From here, the route continues east a short distance as a four-lane divided highway before ending at US 202 and Route 31 at the Flemington Circle.

==History==
Route 12 was legislated as a new route in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering that was to run from Frenchtown east to Route 28 in Raritan borough, running along its current alignment to Flemington and following present-day US 202 to Raritan. By the 1940s, US 202 and Route 29 were designated along the alignment of Route 12 between Flemington and Raritan, cutting the route&#x27;s eastern terminus back to Flemington. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 12 was officially legislated to run from Frenchtown to US 202 and Route 69 (now Route 31) in Flemington. There are currently plans to modify or eliminate the three traffic circles along Route 12 in Flemington in order to ease traffic congestion along the route. The Main Street Circle was converted to a modern roundabout in 2010 while plans are still being thought out for the other two traffic circles.

By Joint Resolution No. 1, approved April 22, 1940, the New Jersey Legislature designated Route 12 from the junction with present-day Route 31 to Croton as the Samuel Hill Highway, in memory of local industrial pioneer Samuel Hill.

<text>Route 15 is a state highway in New Jersey, spanning Morris and Sussex counties, which travels for from West MacFarland Street (U.S. Route 46) in Dover to an intersection of U.S. Route 206 and Sussex Road (CR 565) in Frankford Township. It becomes a divided highway in Wharton until becoming a freeway bypass near Sparta. Route 15 was originally Route 6A from 1927 until 1953, when a renumbering occurred and the route was given its current number. Since the finishing of the Sparta Bypass, the New Jersey Department of Transportation and North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority have considered more bypasses and alignment changes for Route 15.

==Route description==
Route 15 currently exists in two disconnected segments. The southern segment begins in Downtown Dover at an intersection with US 46 and Mount Hope Avenue (CR 661). It follows North Bergen Street south a short distance to East Clinton Street, then turns west along East Clinton Street through Downtown Dover. This segment, which is signed in Downtown Dover, was disconnected from the rest of the route when a new intersection between U.S. Route 46 and Route 15 was constructed just northwest of Downtown Dover. Route 15 formerly passed under U.S. Route 46 along the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad at the location of this new intersection. The southern segment ends at a dead end just southeast of the new intersection, with the northern segment of Route 15 starting again at U.S. Route 46 almost directly above the rail line.

From the new intersection with U.S. Route 46, Route 15 continues north on West Clinton Street, exiting Dover and entering Rockaway Township. The road remains two lanes past the turn for the Rockaway Townsquare shopping mall. For a very short distance Route 15 becomes a freeway as it crosses the interchange with Interstate 80. A mile north, the road becomes a four lane divided highway with exits for a few businesses and Picatinny Arsenal. At that point, Route 15 leaves Rockaway Township and enters Jefferson Township. In Jefferson Township, the northbound and southbound lanes become about a quarter mile apart as it climbs up a steep mountain. The southbound lanes have businesses, easy access to them, and a speed limit of as these were the original lanes of Route 15 when it was only a two lane highway. The northbound lanes are nearly a freeway with limited access to businesses on the southbound lanes. The northbound lanes have a speed limit of 50 mph as well. These two lanes were built in the late 1960s.

Slightly farther north, Route 15 becomes a freeway and the northbound and southbound lanes come closer together. At this point, the original two-lane Route 15 breaks off into Route 181, heading through Jefferson Township and into Downtown Sparta. Several miles north, the freeway leaves Jefferson Township in Morris County and enters Sparta in Sussex County, bypassing Downtown Sparta. After bypassing Downtown Sparta, Route 181 ends and merges onto Route 15. The freeway ends and Route 15 becomes a two-lane road before crossing the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway at grade crossing. After Route 15 leaves Sparta and enters Lafayette Township, it merges with Route 94. Routes 15 and 94 run as a concurrency until Route 94 turns off to the southeast while Route 15 heads northwest. It continues into Frankford Township and comes to an end at the intersection of U.S. Route 206 and Sussex Road (CR 565).

==History==

Route 15 follows the course of an old Lenape trail running from what is now Ross Corner to Dover. In 1804, this road was legislated as a part of the Union Turnpike, which ran from Morristown north. In 1938, Route 15 was designated as State Highway Route 6A. In the 1953 renumbering, the current designation was assigned. 

In 2004, State Department of Transportation Commissioner Jack Lettire and state Senator Robert Littell announced the completion of a project of restructuring the Route 15-Houses Corner Road intersection, which broke ground in 2002 at the hand of then-governor James E. McGreevey. The original intersection was a signalized intersection with a blinking light and no left turn-off lanes from Route 15. Because of heavy traffic, turning left onto Houses Corner Road became dangerous for motorists. The intersection now has a full traffic light. The project cost a total of $15.5 million.

Wilson Drive and White Lake Road were also realigned to form one signalized intersection, with completion originally expected in 2008. The intersection was improved, with construction finishing on June 1, 2009, after eight months of work starting in October 2008. The project cost the state $2.3 million to fund for construction by the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilson/whitelake finished&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Studies are being made to improve the Route 15 corridor from Interstate 80 to U.S. Route 206. Concepts include widening, the addition of climbing lanes, and a potential bypass of Lafayette Township.

The project to construct a new intersection at US 46 in Dover began in 2008; the project also entailed the replacement of bridges on US 46 over the Morristown and Erie Railway (now Dover and Rockaway River Railroad) and the Rockaway River. A temporary intersection was completed in January 2010 utilizing a former US 46 westbound–Route 15 northbound ramp. The permanent intersection was completed in August 2011.

In February 2012, a bill was introduced in the New Jersey General Assembly by Michael Patrick Carroll, Gary R. Chiusano, Alison Littell McHose and Jay Webber to designate Route 15 as the &quot;Ronald Reagan Memorial Highway&quot; to honor U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

<doc id="99536" wikidata="Q821757" url="?curid=99536" title="New Jersey Route 17">
<text>Route 17 is a state highway in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States, that provides a major route from the George Washington Bridge, Lincoln Tunnel and other northeast New Jersey points to the New York State Thruway at Suffern, New York. It runs from an intersection with Route 7 and County Route 507 (CR 507) in North Arlington north to the New York state line along Interstate 287 (I-287) in Mahwah, where New York State Route 17 (NY 17) continues into New York. Between Route 7 and Route 3 in Rutherford, Route 17 serves as a local road. From Route 3 north to the junction with U.S. Route 46 (US 46) in Hasbrouck Heights, the road is an arterial road with jughandles. The portion of Route 17 from US 46 to I-287 near the state line in Mahwah is a four- to six-lane arterial with all cross traffic handled by interchanges, and many driveways and side streets accessed from right-in/right-out ramps from the right lane. For three miles (5 km) north of Route 4, well over a hundred retail stores and several large shopping malls line the route in the borough of Paramus. The remainder of this portion of Route 17 features lighter suburban development. The northernmost portion of Route 17 in Mahwah runs concurrently with I-287 to the New York state line.

Prior to 1927, the route was designated as Route 17N, which was to run from Newark to the New York state line. This route had followed various local streets, including Franklin Turnpike north of Hackensack. In 1927, Route 17N became Route 2, which was designated along the portion of Route 17N between Route 7 in North Arlington to the New York border near Suffern, New York. This route was moved to a multilane divided highway alignment north of Rutherford by 1937. Route 2 became Route 17 in 1942 to match the designation of NY 17 for defense purposes during World War II. The entire Route 17 corridor was once planned to be a freeway until the 1960s, and later plans to extend the route south of Route 3 to I-280 in 1972 and to the New Jersey Turnpike in 1987 both failed. Over the years, the portion of Route 17 north of Route 3 has seen many improvements, including the widening of much of the road to six lanes and the removal of most at-grade intersections in the 1950s as well as more recent improvements to the interchanges with Route 4 in Paramus in 1999 and Essex Street/Maywood Avenue on the Lodi/Maywood border in 2008. The route is currently undergoing improvements between Route 3 and US 46 and is expected to see improvements from Williams Avenue in Hasbrouck Heights to south of Route 4 in Paramus.

==Route description==

Route 17 begins at an intersection with Route 7 and CR 507 (Belleville Turnpike) on the border of Kearny, Hudson County and North Arlington, Bergen County. It heads north through North Arlington on Ridge Road, a two-lane local street that passes by businesses and the Holy Cross Cemetery on the east side of the road. It intersects CR 26 (Jauncey Avenue) and crosses into Lyndhurst at the Lincoln Avenue intersection. In Lyndhurst, Route 17 intersects CR 28 (Kingsland Avenue) and passes over NJ Transit&#x27;s Main Line at Kingsland station. At the intersection of CR 30 (Rutherford Avenue), which runs along the border of Lyndhurst and Rutherford, the route turns east onto Rutherford Avenue to parallel the Route 3 freeway to the south and head for the edge of the New Jersey Meadowlands, widening to a four-lane arterial road at the intersection with Orient Way. Route 17 makes a curve to the south, crossing entirely into Lyndhurst, and makes a hairpin turn to the north, widening to a divided highway. The road then crosses into Rutherford and comes to the Route 3 interchange.

Past the Route 3 interchange, Route 17 continues north as a six-lane arterial road with intersections featuring jughandles. It passes through residential and commercial areas of Rutherford, intersecting CR 32 (Meadow Road) before crossing under NJ Transit&#x27;s Bergen County Line and into East Rutherford, where it intersects CR S32 (Union Avenue) before interchanging with Route 120 and CR 120 (Paterson Plank Road). The route runs through Carlstadt, where it crosses into Wood-Ridge. Route 17 comes to an interchange with CR 36 (Moonachie Road) before entering Hasbrouck Heights. With the exception of a short stretch in Rutherford with a median strip, this section of Route 17 is divided by a jersey barrier.
In Hasbrouck Heights, the lanes split with the Bendix Diner located between the traffic lanes at the intersection of CR 40 (Williams Avenue), the northernmost traffic light on Route 17. At the interchange with US 46, which only features access to the eastbound direction of US 46, Route 17 drops to two lanes in each direction and continues north with the lanes merging back together as the road interchanges with CR 55 (Terrace Avenue). The road enters Hackensack with the lanes splitting again for the long interchange with I-80. Along this strip, the road is again three lanes in each direction and includes an interchange with CR 57 (Summit Avenue), crossing into Lodi and heading across the now-defunct New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s Lodi Branch line. The lanes rejoin upon splitting from I-80 with a lane dropping in each direction at the CR 56 (Essex Street) and CR 59 (Maywood Avenue) interchange on the Maywood border. This portion of the highway is subject to frequent congestion. Route 17 continues north through commercial areas, crossing into Rochelle Park where the route passes over New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s New Jersey Subdivision line and interchanges with CR 62 (Passaic Street) before entering Paramus.

At the CR 61 (Farview Avenue) interchange, the road regains a third lane in each direction. Route 17 passes by the Westfield Garden State Plaza shopping mall on the west side of the road before coming to an interchange with Route 4. Route 17 is flanked by businesses and shopping malls for most of its length in Paramus. Following Route 4, the road interchanges with Century Road. Route 17 comes to a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway, with access limited to northbound-to-northbound and southbound-to-southbound movements between the two roads. North of the Garden State Parkway, Route 17 features interchanges for Midland Avenue, the Paramus Park shopping mall and an industrial park, and CR 80 (Ridgewood Avenue) just north of the Fashion Center shopping mall.
Route 17 crosses into Ridgewood and interchanges with CR 110 (Linwood Avenue), where the penetration of businesses along the side of the road lessens dramatically. In Ridgewood, the road interchanges with CR 62 (Paramus Road), crosses the Saddle River, and intersects a separate segment of CR 62 (Franklin Turnpike) and West Saddle River Road. This intersection, along with other at-grade intersections along this portion of Route 17, is a right-in/right-out (RIRO) intersection with cross traffic blocked by a jersey barrier. Past here, there is a park and ride lot serving Short Line commuter and intercity buses accessible from the southbound direction. There is another RIRO intersection for CR 112 (Race Track Road) on the Ho-Ho-Kus border. Upon crossing into Ho-Ho-Kus, the businesses stop along Route 17 and it comes to an interchange with CR 502 (Hollywood Avenue). The route enters Waldwick and interchanges with CR 77 (Sheridan Avenue). It enters Saddle River, continuing north to an interchange with CR 90 (Allendale Avenue).

Route 17 enters Allendale, with businesses resuming along the road. It enters Upper Saddle River before running through Ramsey, where the road crosses back into Upper Saddle River. The route comes to an interchange with CR 81 (Lake Street/Crescent Avenue), where it crosses back into Ramsey. In Ramsey, Route 17 turns to the northwest and features a RIRO for CR 83 (Airmount Avenue), an interchange with CR 507 (Franklin Turnpike), and an interchange for Island Avenue/Spring Street. The route passes over NJ Transit&#x27;s Bergen County Line/Main Line near the Ramsey Route 17 station and enters Mahwah. In Mahwah, Route 17 intersects CR 85 (Island Road) and CR 100 (Ramapo Avenue). North of Ramapo Avenue, Route 17 features an interchange with US 202 (Ramapo Valley Road) and crosses the Ramapo River. Route 17 has an interchange with Mountainside Avenue and Crossroads Boulevard just before merging with I-287, which it follows to the New York state line, where the road continues into Hillburn, Rockland County, as I-287 and NY 17, intersecting I-87 (New York State Thruway) shortly after the state line.

==History==
Route 17 follows the course of the Haginsack Trail, an old Lenape Trail running north from what is now Newark to Suffern, New York, and possibly beyond. The Franklin Turnpike was legislated in 1806 to run from Hackensack north to the New York state line at Suffern. This road was incorporated into two auto trails: the Liberty Highway, signed in 1918 to run from Cleveland, Ohio, to New York City; and the West Shore Route, which ran from New York City to Albany. Both routes followed the same roads in New Jersey, coming in from Suffern, along the Franklin Turnpike, Paramus Road and Passaic Avenue, and local roads through Teaneck and Englewood before taking a ferry at Englewood Cliffs to New York.
Route 17N was defined in 1923 to run &quot;from Newark, by way of Kearny, Rutherford, Hackensack, Ridgewood and Ramsey to the New York State Line&quot;. However, only the road north of Route 10 (Essex Street) in Hackensack was shown on the 1925 New Jersey State Highway Department Official State Map, running north along existing roads—First Street and the Franklin Turnpike (now partly called Passaic Street and Paramus Road)—to the state line. The 1927 Tydol Trails Map shows the route running south to Newark, continuing south across Essex Street on Polifly Road, Terrace Avenue and Hackensack Street to East Rutherford, where it followed Meadow Road, Rutherford Avenue, Ridge Road, Kearny Avenue, 4th Street, and the Newark Turnpike to Newark. In 1924, New York had numbered its state routes, and the extension of NY 17N north and west to Westfield, New York was numbered as NY 17, as shown in part on the Tydol Trails Map.

In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 17N received the Route 2 designation, and was defined to run from Route 7 in North Arlington to the New York state line near Suffern, New York. By 1937, the whole old road north of Rutherford was bypassed by a new four-lane divided highway with the exception of the 1927 bridge over the Saddle River in Ridgewood, north of the Paramus Road interchange. This old alignment joins at Paramus Road and leaves just north of the bridge at Franklin Turnpike, which only has access to the southbound lanes through a RIRO intersection. A short-lived spur of Route 2, Route 2N, was defined in 1938 to run from Route 2 (Ridge Road) in Lyndhurst west along Kingsland Avenue and over the Passaic River on the Park Avenue Bridge into Nutley, where it would end at Union Avenue (west of Route 7). In 1930, New York had renumbered its state routes; the extension of Route 2 north and west into New York had remained NY 17. New Jersey had not assigned a Route 17 in the 1927 renumbering, and so in March 1942, Route 2 was numbered Route 17 to match and provide a single number for military caravans during World War II.

Since at least 1936, Route 17 (then Route 2) was planned for upgrading to a freeway, not only north of US 46, but also south to the Newark area. The first plan for a freeway along the length of the route was halted due to World War II, and the second plan for a freeway in the 1960s was cancelled due to the disruption it was projected to cause to businesses and residents along its path. In 1972, there were plans to extend Route 17 past Route 3 to I-280 in Harrison. The plans for this , $50 million extension were cancelled due to the defeat of a transportation bond that would have funded the proposed freeway. The interchange at Route 3 was built to allow for this southern extension. Another extension of Route 17 to the New Jersey Turnpike was brought up in 1987, but was ultimately scrapped.
The road north of Route 3 was gradually rebuilt to higher standards between 1953 and 1960; most of this portion of Route 17 was upgraded to six lanes and most at-grade intersections were removed north of I-80 in Lodi. The northern of Route 17 in Mahwah was incorporated into Interstate 287 in 1994. The Route 4 interchange in Paramus was rebuilt at a cost of $120 million in 1999, replacing the 1932 cloverleaf interchange by adding several flyover ramps. In 2008, construction was completed at the interchange with Essex Street on the Lodi–Maywood border, which involved replacing the Essex Street bridge over Route 17 and improving the interchange ramps, at a cost of $68 million. On January 14, 2008, Governor Jon Corzine announced plans to reduce congestion and improve safety along the portion of Route 17 between Williams Avenue in Hasbrouck Heights to south of Route 4 in Paramus by making it a consistent six lanes. Also, a $14.7 million effort, begun in September 2008, was undertaken to improve safety and reduce bottlenecks along the section of Route 17 between Route 3 and US 46.

Route 17 has been the object of several studies exploring a Bergen BRT, a bus rapid transit system that would potentially alleviate some traffic congestion and decrease automobile dependency. While funding has not been identified, the potential routes of the system have centered around the vicinity radiating from the malls of Paramus.

On December 8, 2014, the portion of Route 17 in Ramsey was named the Staff Sergeant Timothy R. McGill Memorial Highway in honor of a Ramsey High School graduate, Marine Corps veteran, and local firefighter. On May 11, 2015, the portion of Route 17 in Waldwick was named the Christopher Goodell Memorial Highway in honor of a Waldwick police officer who died when he was struck by a tractor trailer on the highway in July 2014.

<doc id="99537" wikidata="Q4950604" url="?curid=99537" title="BowLingual">
<text>, or &quot;Bow-Lingual&quot; as the North American version is spelled, is a computer-based dog language-to-human language translation device developed by Japanese toy company Takara and first sold in Japan in 2002. Versions for South Korea and the United States were launched in 2003. The device was named by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;Best Inventions of 2002.&quot; The inventors of BowLingual, Keita Satoh, Matsumi Suzuki and Norio Kogure were awarded the 2002 Ig Nobel Prize for &quot;promoting peace and harmony between the species.&quot;

The device is presented as a &quot;translator&quot; but has been called an &quot;emotion analyzer&quot;. It is said to categorize dog barks into one of six standardized emotional categories. BowLingual also provides a phrase which is representative of that emotion. The product instructions state that these phrases &quot;are for entertainment purposes only&quot; and are not meant to be accurate translations of each bark.

== Features ==
BowLingual has bow functions which include dog training tips, a &quot;Bow Wow Diary,&quot; tips on understanding a dog&#x27;s body language, a medical checklist and a home alone bark recording function. The device consists of a hand-held receiver that contains a LCD information screen and functions as the controller and a wireless microphone-transmitter which is attached to the dog&#x27;s collar.

When a dog barks, the microphone records and transmits the sound to the hand-held unit for computer analysis by a database with thousands of dog barks pre-recorded into it. The unit then categorizes the bark into one of six distinct dog emotions (happy, sad, frustrated, on-guard, assertive, needy) and displays the corresponding emotion on the screen. After displaying the emotion, BowLingual then displays a phrase which has been categorized to fit within the range of each emotion.

== Versions ==
Regional versionals of BowLingual have been released in Japan, South Korea, the US and Canada. The versions for South Korea, the US and Canada have different modifications in comparison to the Japanese version. In May 2003, at the request of the Japan Foreign Ministry, Takara provided Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi with two prototypes of the English version of BowLingual several months before it had been released in North America. Koizumi then presented these to Russian President Vladimir Putin, for each of his dogs (Tosca, a standard Poodle, and Connie, a Labrador Retriever), at ceremonies celebrating the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg.

==Effectiveness==
BowLingual uses customized voice-print analysis technology which has been adapted for dog barks. The accuracy of this product can be affected by varying conditions and situations. Sound interference can occur when the wireless collar-microphone picks up noises made by chain collars and collars with dog tags attached. As a result, the dog owner may believe that the device is malfunctioning and not registering the dog bark correctly.

In windy conditions, the microphone will sometimes interpret a gust of wind as a bark. Electrical equipment and certain radio signals may trigger false readouts. Due to improvements with the US and Canadian versions of the products, these problems are more common with the Japanese and South Korean versions.

One reviewer of the product, vet Sophia Yin stated &quot;it&#x27;s not very useful because the translations aren&#x27;t trustworthy and most don&#x27;t make sense.&quot;

Csaba Molnar and colleagues at Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary proved by computer-based machine learning algorithms that there are consistent differences in the acoustics of dog barks according to the behavioural context and individuals.

==Related products==
In 2003 Takara launched a follow-up product for cats called Meowlingual (ミャウリンガル). It functioned similarly to BowLingual; however, it did not use the wireless microphone system. Instead, the microphone was contained in the main hand-held unit so that the user had to be close enough to, in effect, &quot;interview&quot; the cat. Without the wireless component, Meowlingual was considerably cheaper than BowLingual. Meowlingual was never launched in the U.S. or any other countries, so only Japanese language versions exist. The iPhone version of BowLingual similarly listens to the dog through the iPhone&#x27;s microphone.

<doc id="99543" wikidata="Q1470381" url="?curid=99543" title="Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.">
<text>Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. is the debut studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen. It was produced from June through October 1972 by Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos at the budget-priced 914 Sound Studios. The album was released January 5, 1973, by Columbia Records to average sales but a positive critical reception.

&quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; first charted in the United Kingdom on June 15, 1985, in the wake of Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; tour arriving in Britain; it remained in the top 100 for ten weeks. In 2003, the album was ranked at No. 379 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list and in 2013 the same magazine listed &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; as one of the &quot;100 Greatest Debut Albums of All Time&quot;. On November 22, 2009, the album was played in its entirety for the first time by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, at the HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York, to celebrate the last show of the &quot;Working on a Dream&quot; tour.

==Recording==
Springsteen and his first manager Mike Appel recorded the album at the low-priced, out-of-the-way 914 Sound Studios to save as much as possible of the Columbia Records advance, and cut most of the songs during the last week of June 1972.

There was a dispute not long after the record was recorded—Appel and John Hammond preferred the solo tracks, while Springsteen preferred the band songs. As such, a compromise was reached—the album was to feature five songs with the band (&quot;For You&quot;, &quot;Growin&#x27; Up&quot;, &quot;Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Hard to be a Saint in the City&quot;, and &quot;Lost in the Flood&quot;) and five solo songs (&quot;Mary Queen of Arkansas&quot;, &quot;The Angel&quot;, &quot;Jazz Musician&quot;, &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; and &quot;Visitation at Fort Horn&quot;).

However, when Columbia Records president Clive Davis heard the album submitted on August 10, 1972, he felt that it lacked a potential hit single, and rejected it. Springsteen quickly wrote &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; and &quot;Spirit in the Night&quot;, and recorded both on September 11, 1972. Because pianist David Sancious and bassist Garry Tallent were unavailable, a four-man band was used—Vini Lopez on drums, Harold Wheeler on piano, Springsteen on guitar, piano (on Spirit in the Night only), and bass, and the previously missing Clarence Clemons on saxophone. Columbia accepted the revised album, and Davis was personally pleased with Springsteen&#x27;s response.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in July 1973, Lester Bangs hailed Springsteen as a daring new artist who sets himself apart from his contemporaries with songwriting that either has a serious meaning or showcases his uninhibited gift for verbose, overloaded lyrics and rhyme schemes. &quot;Some of [his words] can mean something socially or otherwise&quot;, Bangs said, &quot;but there&#x27;s plenty of &#x27;em that don&#x27;t even pretend to, reveling in the joy of utter crass showoff talent run amuck and totally out of control&quot;. Peter Knobler wrote in &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; that &quot;he sings with a freshness and urgency I haven&#x27;t heard since I was rocked by &#x27;Like a Rolling Stone&#x27; ... the album rocks, then glides, then rocks again. There is the combined sensibility of the chaser and the chaste, the street punk and the bookworm.&quot; &quot;Creem&quot; magazine&#x27;s Robert Christgau said Springsteen&#x27;s songs are dominated by the kind of mannered emotional transparency and &quot;absurdist energy&quot; that made Bob Dylan &quot;a genius instead of a talent&quot;. In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide&quot; (1981), he wrote that despite the grandiloquent, unaccompanied &quot;Mary Queen of Arkansas&quot; and &quot;The Angel&quot;, songs such as &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; and &quot;Growin&#x27; Up&quot; foreshadow Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;unguarded teen-underclass poetry&quot;, while even the maundering &quot;Lost in the Flood&quot; is interesting.

In &quot;All Music Guide to Rock&quot; (2002), William Ruhlmann gave &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; five stars and said that it combined the mid-1960s folk rock music of Bob Dylan, accessible melodies, and elaborate arrangements and lyrics: &quot;&quot;Asbury Park&quot; painted a portrait of teenagers cocksure of themselves, yet bowled over by their discovery of the world. It was saved from pretentiousness (if not preciousness) by its sense of humor and by the careful eye for detail ... that kept even the most high-flown language rooted.&quot; In 2003, the album was ranked number 379 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. They ranked it 37th on their list of greatest debut albums.

<text>This Is Spinal Tap (also known as This Is Spın̈al Tap: A Rockumentary by Martin Di Bergi) is a 1984 American mockumentary comedy film co-written and directed by Rob Reiner (in his feature directorial debut). The film stars Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer as members of the heavy metal band Spinal Tap, who are characterized as &quot;one of England&#x27;s loudest bands&quot;. Reiner plays Martin &quot;Marty&quot; Di Bergi, a documentary filmmaker who follows them on their American tour. The film satirizes the behavior and musical pretensions of rock bands and the perceived hagiographic tendencies of rock documentaries such as &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; (1978), and follows the similar &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; (1978) by the Rutles. Most of its dialogue was improvised and dozens of hours were filmed.

&quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; was released to critical acclaim, but its initial release found only modest commercial success. Its later VHS release brought it greater success and a cult following. In 2002, it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress, and was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry. It has been credited with &quot;effectively&quot; launching the mockumentary genre. It is also notable as the origin of the phrase &quot;Up to eleven&quot;.

==Plot==
Filmmaker Martin &quot;Marty&quot; Di Bergi is filming a documentary about English rock band Spinal Tap&#x27;s 1982 United States concert tour to promote their new album, &quot;Smell the Glove&quot;. The band comprises childhood friends David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel on vocals and guitar, bassist Derek Smalls, keyboardist Viv Savage, and drummer Mick Shrimpton.

The documentary shows Spinal Tap&#x27;s early days as the skiffle group The Originals; they renamed themselves the New Originals when it was discovered another band was already called The Originals, only to change it back when the original Originals broke up. They later had a hit as the Thamesmen, &quot;Gimme Some Money,&quot; before changing their name to Spinal Tap and achieving a significant hit with the flower power anthem &quot;Listen to the Flower People&quot;; they subsequently began performing heavy metal music. Several of the band&#x27;s previous drummers died under strange circumstances: John &quot;Stumpy&quot; Pepys died in a &quot;bizarre gardening accident&quot; that police said was better left unsolved, Eric &quot;Stumpy Joe&quot; Childs died choking on someone else&#x27;s vomit, and Peter &quot;James&quot; Bond exploded on stage. Nigel shows Marty his extensive guitar collection, as well as a custom-made amplifier that has volume knobs that go up to eleven; Nigel believes this makes the amplifier &quot;one louder&quot; than most other amplifiers, which have &quot;ten&quot; as the highest volume setting.
Tensions rise between the band and their manager, Ian Faith, as several shows are canceled due to low ticket sales, and major retailers refuse to sell &quot;Smell the Glove&quot; because of its sexist cover art. David&#x27;s girlfriend Jeanine, a yoga and astrology devotee, joins the group on tour and participates in band meetings. Nigel and Ian dislike Jeanine&#x27;s ideas for Spinal Tap&#x27;s costumes and stage presentation. Without consulting Spinal Tap, the band&#x27;s record label releases &quot;Smell the Glove&quot; with an entirely black album cover. Despite Ian&#x27;s assertion that it could have a similar appeal to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot;, &quot;Smell the Glove&quot; fails to sell.

Nigel suggests staging a lavish, Druid-themed glam rock show and asks Ian to order a Stonehenge trilithon. However, Nigel mislabels its dimensions, and the resulting prop is only high rather than , making the group a laughing stock. The group blames Ian, and when David suggests Jeanine should co-manage the group, Ian quits. The tour continues, rescheduled for much smaller venues, and Jeanine and David increasingly marginalize Nigel. At a gig at a United States Air Force base, Nigel is upset by an equipment malfunction and quits mid-performance. At their next gig, in an amphitheater at an amusement park where the band is billed below a puppet show, the band finds their repertoire is severely limited without Nigel. At Derek&#x27;s suggestion, the band improvises an experimental &quot;Jazz Odyssey&quot;, which is poorly received.

On the last day of the tour, David and Derek consider ending Spinal Tap and exploring other projects, such as a musical about Jack the Ripper called &quot;Saucy Jack&quot;. Before they go on stage, Nigel arrives and tells them that Spinal Tap&#x27;s song &quot;Sex Farm&quot; has become a major hit in Japan and that Ian wants to arrange a tour there. David bitterly refuses, but later, as Nigel watches the band performing from the wings, David relents and invites Nigel to join the band onstage, delighting the crowd but infuriating Jeanine. During the performance, Mick explodes on stage. Ian is rehired as the group&#x27;s manager, and Spinal Tap (now with Joe &quot;Mama&quot; Besser as their drummer) performs a series of sold-out shows in Japan.

==Production==
===Background===
Michael McKean and Christopher Guest met while in college in New York City in the late 1960s, and they played music together. They worked with Harry Shearer and Rob Reiner on a TV pilot in 1978 for a sketch comedy show called &quot;The TV Show&quot;, which featured a parody rock band called Spinal Tap. During production of that sketch (while being burned with oil from an on-stage effect) McKean and Guest began to improvise, inventing characters that became David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel.

Guest had previously played guitar under the name &quot;Nigel Tufnel&quot; on Michael McKean and David Lander&#x27;s album &quot;Lenny and the Squigtones&quot;.

===Development===
The entire film was shot in Los Angeles over a period of about five weeks on handheld 16mm cameras. The visit to Elvis Presley&#x27;s grave was filmed in a park in Altadena, with a mock-up of the grave site. The band sings &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; because that was the only Elvis song for which producer Karen Murphy could obtain rights.

Rob Reiner procured $60,000 from Marble Arch Productions to write a screenplay with McKean, Guest and Shearer, based on the Spinal Tap characters. They realized after a few days of writing that no script could capture the kind of movie they wanted to make, so they decided instead to shoot a short demo of the proposed film. They shopped the demo around to various studios but had no takers, until television writer-producer Norman Lear decided to back the project, providing them with a budget of $2 million.

Virtually all dialogue in the film is improvised. Actors were given outlines indicating where scenes would begin and end and character information necessary to avoid contradictions, but everything else came from the actors. As often as possible, the first take was used in the film, to capture natural reactions. Reiner wanted to list the entire cast as writers on the film to acknowledge their contributions, but the Writers&#x27; Guild objected, and so only he, Guest, McKean, and Shearer received writing credit.

Veteran documentary cameraman Peter Smokler worked as cinematographer on the film. Smokler had great instincts for camera placement on set, according to Reiner, and is responsible for the film&#x27;s handheld cinéma vérité style—although the cinematographer did not understand what was supposed to be funny about the movie. With Smokler behind the camera, the film was shot not as a feature film, but as a documentary, without a script or traditional shooting schedule. So much footage was filmed (over 100 hours) that it eventually required three editors to complete the film.

Inspirations for the film included the documentaries &quot;Dont Look Back&quot; (1967), which was made about Bob Dylan, and &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; (1978), which was about The Band. The scene where Spinal Tap becomes lost backstage was inspired by a video of Tom Petty at a venue in Germany, walking through a series of doors trying to find the stage, but ending up on an indoor tennis court. Rob Reiner also went to see the English heavy metal band Judas Priest in concert as part of his preparation for the film. He later said, &quot;It physically hurt my chest. The reverberation in the hall was so strong that I couldn&#x27;t stay there any longer.&quot; According to Harry Shearer in the Criterion edition DVD commentary, keyboard player John Sinclair had just returned from touring with Uriah Heep when principal photography was about to begin, and told them how they had been booked to play an Air Force base. They subsequently used the story in the film.

In post-production, Christopher Guest was very concerned with the verisimilitude of the finger positions on the band&#x27;s instruments during the concert scenes, and even re-shot some footage after the movie was edited to ensure their hands appeared in sync with the music.

The character of Jeanine, David&#x27;s disruptive girlfriend, was added during the production to provide a storyline to the material—in part to mollify studio executives who worried the movie would be plotless. Actress Victoria Tennant was briefly considered for the role, but June Chadwick won the part, thanks to her chemistry with the cast and her improvisation skills.

Robert Bauer played the same character, Moke, in another Reiner movie, &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; (1985).

==Reception and legacy==

===Contemporaneous reviews===

At the time of its release, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four and wrote &quot;&quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; is one of the funniest, most intelligent, most original films of the year. The satire has a deft, wicked touch. Spinal Tap is not that much worse than, not that much different from, some successful rock bands.&quot; Ebert later placed the film on his ten best list of 1984 and would later include it in his Great Movies list in 2001 where he called it &quot;one of the funniest movies ever made&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also awarded four out of four, writing, &quot;It is so well done, in fact, that unless you are clued in beforehand, it might take you a while to realize that the rock group under dissection in &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; does not really exist.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised it as &quot;a witty, mischievous satire, and it&#x27;s obviously a labor of love.&quot;

Critics praised the film not only for its satire of the rollercoaster lifestyles of rock stars but also for its take on the non-fiction film genre. David Ansen from &quot;Newsweek&quot; called the film &quot;a satire of the documentary form itself, complete with perfectly faded clips from old TV shows of the band in its mod and flower-child incarnations&quot;.

Even with cameos from Anjelica Huston, Billy Crystal and Patrick Macnee, &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; still managed to trick many of its moviegoers into believing the band existed. Reiner observed that &quot;when &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; initially came out, everybody thought it was a real band... the reason it did go over everybody&#x27;s head was that it was very close to home&quot;.

===Retrospective assessment===
&quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; is widely regarded as one of the best films of 1984. The film holds a 96% rating on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 8.60/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Smartly directed, brilliantly acted, and packed with endlessly quotable moments, &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; is an all-time comedy classic.&quot; On 

In 2002, &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

In 2000, the American Film Institute placed the film at number 29 in its 100 Years…100 Laughs list.
In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; #48 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on their list of &quot;The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot;. In January 2010, &quot;Total Film&quot; placed &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. When &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; compiled their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;, the publication included the film as &quot;just too beloved to ignore&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Time Out London&quot; named it the best comedy film of all time. In November 2015, the film was ranked the 11th funniest screenplay by the Writers Guild of America in its list of &quot;101 Funniest Screenplays&quot;. Stephen Sondheim listed it among his favorite films of all time.

===Reactions from musicians===

The film resonated with many musicians. Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Jerry Cantrell, Dee Snider and Ozzy Osbourne all reported that, like Spinal Tap, they had become lost in confusing arena backstage hallways trying to make their way to the stage. When Dokken&#x27;s George Lynch saw the film he is said to have exclaimed, &quot;That&#x27;s us! How&#x27;d they make a movie about us?&quot; Glenn Danzig had a similar reaction when comparing Spinal Tap to his former band the Misfits saying, &quot;When I first saw Spinal Tap, I was like, &#x27;Hey, this is my old band.&#x27;&quot;

Lars Ulrich told a press conference crowd that the 1992 Guns N&#x27; Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour seemed &quot;so Spinal Tap.&quot; This tour was in support of Metallica&#x27;s own &quot;black album&quot;. Shortly after the tour started, Metallica&#x27;s James Hetfield suffered third-degree burns on his arms after he stood too close to a pyrotechnic device. Earlier in that tour, backstage at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, Metallica met with Spinal Tap and discussed how their &quot;black album&quot; was a homage to Spinal Tap&#x27;s &quot;Smell the Glove&quot;. This was captured on the Metallica DVD &quot;A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica&quot;.

In a 1992 interview, Nirvana explained declining an offer to be part of the film &quot;Singles&quot;. Kurt Cobain goes on to say, &quot;There&#x27;s never really been a good documentary on rock and roll bands.&quot; Dave Grohl then cuts in saying, &quot;Except for &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;, [that] was the only rock movie worth watching,&quot; which Cobain agreed with, as well as mentioning &quot;Dont Look Back&quot;, by D.A. Pennebaker.

According to a 1997 interview in &quot;Spin&quot; magazine with Aerosmith rhythm guitarist Brad Whitford, &quot;The first time Steven [Tyler] saw it he didn&#x27;t see any humor in it.&quot; When the film was released, Aerosmith&#x27;s then-latest album, &quot;Rock in a Hard Place&quot;, depicted Stonehenge prominently on the cover.

U2 guitarist The Edge said in the documentary &quot;It Might Get Loud&quot; that when he first saw &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;, &quot;I didn&#x27;t laugh: I wept,&quot; because it summed up what a brainless swamp big-label rock music had become.

In a 2023 interview Chris Frantz of Talking Heads said &quot;we watched &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; and I thought, ohh, I can never take myself seriously again.&quot;

=== Use of &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; as a descriptive term ===

It became a common insult for a pretentious band to be told they were funnier than Spinal Tap. As George Lynch put it, the more seriously a band took themselves, the more they resembled Spinal Tap. After seeing a 1986 performance by metal band Venom, singer Henry Rollins compared them to Spinal Tap. In their respective &quot;Behind the Music&quot; episodes, Quiet Riot&#x27;s Rudy Sarzo and Ratt&#x27;s Robbin Crosby compared their own bands to Spinal Tap to some extent. For example, as a parallel to the &quot;Shit Sandwich&quot; incident, Quiet Riot&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Condition Critical&quot; was given the two-word review of &quot;Prognosis: Terminal&quot; by J. D. Considine in &quot;Musician&quot; magazine. His review of the short-lived band GTR&#x27;s eponymous debut LP in the same magazine was &quot;SHT&quot;. R.E.M.&#x27;s Mike Mills described the band&#x27;s early tours as &quot;very Spinal Tap&quot;, citing, among other things, they had played at a United States Air Force base.

Judas Priest, the heavy metal band that Rob Reiner saw in preparation for the film, has had many drummers in its career (eight in total), which the website &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; described as &quot;positively Spinal Tap-worthy&quot;. Marillion guitarist Steve Rothery later described the run of five drummers in a year between his band&#x27;s first two albums as &quot;like Spinal Tap&quot;. In the Pearl Jam documentary &quot;Pearl Jam Twenty&quot;, the members jokingly refer to the fact that while the core lineup of the group has remained unchanged (singer Eddie Vedder, guitarists Mike McCready and Stone Gossard, and bassist Jeff Ament), the band has had five drummers. They describe this as &quot;very Spinal Tap of us&quot;. In the documentary, a mock silent film called &quot;The Drummer Story&quot; is shown explaining what happened to their previous drummers. In it, one of them is almost eaten by a sea monster, only to be rescued by Eddie Vedder, playing a lifeguard.

The Canadian heavy metal band Anvil, whose drummer is named Robb Reiner, have been called &quot;the real Spinal Tap&quot; based on the misadventures depicted in their documentary &quot;Anvil! The Story of Anvil&quot;.

== Lawsuit ==
On October 17, 2016, actor Harry Shearer filed a $125 million fraud and breach of contract lawsuit against both StudioCanal, who owns the film&#x27;s rights, and Vivendi, which owns the studio. Shearer claimed that he and the other co-stars of the film received only $179 for sales of merchandise and music over the prior three decades. Shearer&#x27;s lawsuit was specifically directed at StudioCanal by ordering the studio to terminate the copyright to &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;. In February 2017, Shearer&#x27;s co-stars Christopher Guest and Michael McKean, as well as the film&#x27;s director Rob Reiner, joined the lawsuit against StudioCanal and Vivendi, seeking $400 million in damages. In the same month, Vivendi made an attempt to move the court to dismiss the case. In September 2017, a judge dismissed Shearer, Reiner and McKean from the case. In October 2017, Spinal Tap revised their case by adding Universal Music Group (UMG, another division of Vivendi, whose Polydor label released the film&#x27;s soundtrack) as a defendant, as well as the right to reclaim their copyrights to the film, its songs and characters.

In August 2018, another judge ruled that Guest, Reiner, McKean and Shearer could pursue the fraud claim against Vivendi.

The case related to sales of the soundtrack was settled out of court by November 2019, with UMG retaining the distribution rights but with the music rights eventually returning to Shearer, Guest, and McKean in the future. A settlement between Vivendi, StudioCanal, and the cast on the merchandising aspect was reached in September 2020 with final details to be resolved in the following months.

==Home media==
&quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; was first released on VHS in 1984 by Embassy Home Entertainment, and in 1994 as part of the Criterion Collection on LaserDisc under the title &quot;This Is Spinal Tap: Special Edition&quot;. It has also been released twice on DVD.

The first DVD release was a 1998 Criterion edition in letterbox format which used supplemental material from the 1994 Criterion LaserDisc release. It is the only double sided DVD in their catalogue, and it is now out of print. It included an audio commentary track with Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer; a second audio commentary track with Rob Reiner, Karen Murphy, Robert Leighton and Kent Beyda; 79 minutes of deleted scenes; &quot;Spinal Tap: The Final Tour&quot;, the original twenty-minute short they shot to pitch the film; two trailers that feature Rob Reiner showing a film about cheese rolling (because &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; itself was still in the editing room); a TV promo, &quot;Heavy Metal Memories&quot;; and a music video for &quot;Hell Hole&quot;. Sales of this edition were discontinued after only two years and the DVD has become a valuable collector&#x27;s item. Much of this material had appeared on a 1994 CD-ROM by The Voyager Company that included the entire film in QuickTime format.

In 2000, MGM Home Entertainment released a special edition with more or less the same extras from the Criterion edition, plus a new audio commentary track with Guest, McKean and Shearer performing in character throughout, commenting on the film entirely in their fictional alter-egos, and often disapproving of how the film presents them; 70 minutes of deleted scenes (some of which were not on the Criterion DVD); a new short, &quot;Catching Up with Marty Di Bergi&quot; (where it is revealed that the members of Spinal Tap were very disappointed in Di Bergi for making a &quot;hatchet job&quot; of their film); the &quot;Heavy Metal Memories&quot; promo and six additional TV promos; music videos for &quot;Gimme Some Money&quot;, &quot;Listen to the Flower People&quot; and &quot;Big Bottom&quot;; and segments of Spinal Tap appearing on &quot;The Joe Franklin Show&quot;. The special features were produced by Automat Pictures. However, this version of the film was missing the subtitles that appear throughout the film (for example, introducing band members, other personnel, and location names) and did not include the commentaries from the Criterion edition. The MGM DVD is missing the subtitles burned into the film; they have been replaced with player generated subtitles.

A 25th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Disc release was released on July 28, 2009. It includes all bonus features from the MGM DVD, plus an interview with Nigel about Stonehenge, as well as the performance of &quot;Stonehenge&quot; from the band&#x27;s Live Earth performance. It does not include the commentaries from the Criterion Collection DVD, even though MGM had stated that they would be included in the earliest press release for the Blu-ray version (most likely due to legal issues), and does not feature a &quot;create your own avatars&quot; element teased in publicity. However, this version does restore the subtitles that introduce band members/locales/events/etc. that were missing from MGM&#x27;s DVD. The alternative, Region B, UK edition of this version additionally features a new hour-long documentary featuring famous fans, the &quot;Bitch School&quot; promo, the EPK for the &quot;Back From The Dead&quot; album, an interview with the late Reg Presley discussing the influence of the Troggs tapes on the film, and the first hour (ending with an abrupt edit) of &quot;The Return Of Spinal Tap&quot;. It does however lose the Di Bergi short and the Joe Franklin clip.

Sometime in the 2000s a workprint version of the film was uploaded online. This version is 270 minutes long. It includes many scenes never released in any home media release.

==Appearances in other media==

Harry Shearer, who played Derek Smalls, went on to become one of the main voice artists on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, providing voices for Principal Skinner, Mr. Burns, Waylon Smithers, Ned Flanders and many others. The members of Spinal Tap reprised their roles in &quot;The Otto Show&quot;, first playing on a concert attended by Bart and Milhouse which escalates into a riot after the band&#x27;s early exit, then having their tour bus run off the road by Otto in the school bus.

The Internet Movie Database normally allows users to rate films only up to ten stars, but specifically for &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;, the site allows users to rate the film eleven stars, referring to the &quot;Up to eleven&quot; scene. On IGN, &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; was the only DVD—and seemingly the only thing reviewed on IGN—to get 11 out of 10. This scene was also used in some news reports on the death of James Charles &quot;Jim&quot; Marshall, founder of the famous amplifier company whose equipment is featured in the scene. Richard D. Titus, UX&amp;D Controller for the BBC, adopted a &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;-inspired suggestion from a colleague that the BBC iPlayer should have a volume control that goes to eleven. The term has entered the vernacular, as with an autistic&#x27;s description of sensory overload &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; a neurotypical&#x27;s routine filtering.

Fran Drescher reprised the role of Bobbi Flekman during the fifth season of her hit television sitcom &quot;The Nanny&quot;; it was the season&#x27;s third episode, titled &quot;The Bobbi Flekman Story&quot;. In the episode, Flekman is now a record label producer for The Brian Setzer Orchestra, and an ex-business partner of character Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy). Drescher&#x27;s regular character Fran Fine believes Flekman is attempting to seduce Sheffield, and impersonates her to stop it.

Outside the world of music, J. K. Rowling cited &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;″s series of drummers as an inspiration for the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, in which something bad happens to every teacher of Defence against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts, causing them to leave the job without completing a full school year.

A biographical comic book was released in 2018, &quot;That Was Spinal Tap&quot;, telling both the fictional story of the band and the real-life tale of the actors and others who created the characters and music. It was scripted by &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Comics&quot; co-creator Jay Allen Sanford.

==Sequels==

A sequel, &quot;The Return of Spinal Tap&quot;, was broadcast and released on video in 1992 to promote &quot;Break Like the Wind&quot;. It consisted mostly of footage from an actual Spinal Tap concert at the Royal Albert Hall. In it, the &quot;Stonehenge&quot; joke from the original movie is referenced, as the new, large prop is too big to get into the venue.

In May 2022, director Rob Reiner announced that he is working on a sequel to the film, which will include him returning to play DiBergi, and McKean, Shearer, and Guest as the members of Spinal Tap. Cameos will include Elton John, Paul McCartney, Garth Brooks, Questlove and Trisha Yearwood.

The film will be Castle Rock Entertainment&#x27;s first film following its revival in 2021. Filming started in February 2024 and Reiner plans to release the film in &quot;late spring or early summer&quot; of 2025.

<doc id="99552" wikidata="Q878062" url="?curid=99552" title="Hindu mythology">
<text>Hindu mythology refers to the collection of myths associated with Hinduism, derived from various Hindu texts and traditions. These myths are found in sacred texts such as the Vedas, the Itihasas (the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Ramayana&quot;), and the Puranas. They also appear in regional and ethnolinguistic texts, including the Bengali &quot;Mangal Kavya&quot; and the Tamil &quot;Periya Puranam&quot; and &quot;Divya Prabandham&quot;. Additionally, Hindu myths are also found in widely translated fables like the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; and the &quot;Hitopadesha&quot;, as well as in Southeast Asian texts influenced by Hindu traditions.

== Meaning of &quot;myth&quot; ==
Myth is a genre of folklore or theology consisting primarily of narratives that play a fundamental role in a society, such as foundational tales or origin myths. For folklorists, historians, philosophers or theologians this is very different from the use of &quot;myth&quot; simply indicating that something is not true. Instead, the truth value of a myth is not a defining criterion. Hindus see this as not just tales, but their proud history and tradition told in great literary form.

Hindu myths can be found in the Vedas, the itihasa (Ramayana and Mahabharata), and the major Puranas. Other sources include the Bengali literature, such as Mangal-Kāvya, and the Tamil literature, such as Divya Prabandham, Tirumurai and the Five Great Epics. These narratives play a crucial role in the Hindu tradition and are considered real and significant within their cultural and spiritual context, offering profound insights into the beliefs and values of Hinduism.

== Origins and development ==

=== Indus Valley Civilisation ===
According to Joseph Campbell, the Indus Valley (2600–1900 BCE) may have left traces in the beliefs and traditions of Hinduism. Artefacts have revealed motifs that are also employed and revered by Hindus today, such as primary male deities worshipped by a ruling elite, mother goddesses, nature spirits, snake worship, as well as the reverence of other theriomorphic (animal-shaped) beings. These themes would be maintained by the Dravidian folk religion even after the decline of its parent civilisation around 1800 BCE.

=== Vedic Period ===
A major factor in the development of Hinduism was the Vedic religion. The Indo-Aryan migration brought their distinct beliefs to the Indian subcontinent, where the Vedas were composed around 1500 BCE. The Indo-Aryans Vedic pantheon of deities included the chief god Indra, the sun deity Surya, Ushas, as well as Agni.

=== Brahmanical Period ===

This period saw the composition of commentaries referred to as the Brahmanas.

=== Upanishad Period ===

According to Williams, from 900 to 600 BCE, the protests of the populace against sacrifices made towards the Vedic gods and rebellions against the Brahmin class led to the embrace of reform by the latter and the composition of the fourth Veda and the Vedanta texts. About half of the Upanishads were mystical and unitive, speaking of experiencing the divine as the one (ekam), while the other half promoted devotion to one or more deities. New gods and goddesses were celebrated, and devotional practices began to be introduced.

===Sramanic movements===
Elements such as those emerging from Buddhism and Jainism made their &quot;heteroprax&quot; contributions to later Hindu mythology, such as temples, indoor shrines, and rituals modeled after service to a divine king. Renunciate traditions contributed elements that questioned sacrifices and the killing of animals, and promoted asceticism and vegetarianism. All of these themes would be incorporated by the Brahmin classes into the later Hindu synthesis, which developed in response to the sramanic movements between ca. 500–300 BCE and 500 CE, and also found their way into Hindu mythology.

=== Epic Period ===

The era from 400 BCE to 400 CE was the period of the compilation of India’s great epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana. These were central manifestations of the newly developing Hindu synthesis, contributing to a specific Hindu mythology, emphasising divine action on earth in Vishnu&#x27;s incarnations and other divine manifestations. The lore of the devas and the asuras expanded. Epic mythology foreshadowed the rich polytheism of the next two periods. The Mahabharata contained two appendices that were extremely important sources for later mythological development, the Bhagavad Gîta and the Harivamsa.

=== Puranic Period ===
According to Williams, the mythology of the Puranas can be broken into three periods (300–500; 500–1000; 1000–1800), or the whole period may simply be referred to as the Hindu Middle Ages. This age saw the composition of the major Puranic texts of the faith, along with the rise of sectarianism, with followers amassing around the cults of Vishnu, Shiva, or Devi. The three denominations within this period help locate in time historical developments within the sectarian communities, the rise and decline of Tantrism and its influence on mainstream mythology, the tendencies in Puranic mythologising of subordinating Vedic gods and past heroes to ever-increasing moral weaknesses, going on to be identified as a period of exuberant polytheism. However, this was also accompanied with the belief in monotheism, the idea that all paths lead to the Ultimate Reality, Brahman.

=== Tantric Period ===
According to Williams, during the Tantric period from 900 to 1600 CE, the mythology of Tantra and Shaktism revived and enriched blood sacrifice and the pursuit of pleasure as central themes. Tantra’s stories differed radically in meaning from those of epic mythology, which favored devotion, asceticism, and duty. There was either a revival or emphasis that was placed on the shakti or the cosmic energy of goddesses, a concept that had emerged during the Indus Valley Civilisation.

=== Modern Period ===
In the contemporary era, the mythologies of the dominant traditions of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism prevail. Several myths were found or invented to make tribals or former &quot;outcastes&quot; Hindus and bring them within the cultural whole of a reconstructed Hindu mythological community.

==Mythical themes and types==
Academic studies of mythology often define mythology as deeply valued stories that explain a society&#x27;s existence and world order: those narratives of a society&#x27;s creation, the society&#x27;s origins and foundations, their god(s), their original heroes, mankind&#x27;s connection to the &quot;divine&quot;, and their narratives of eschatology (what happens in the &quot;after-life&quot;). This is a very general outline of some of the basic sacred stories with those themes. In its broadest academic sense, the word &quot;myth&quot; simply means a traditional story. However, many scholars restrict the term &quot;myth&quot; to sacred stories. Folklorists often go further, defining myths as &quot;tales believed as true, usually sacred, set in the distant past or other worlds or parts of the world, and with extra-human, inhuman, or heroic characters&quot;.

In classical Greek, &quot;muthos&quot;, from which the English word &quot;myth&quot; derives, meant &quot;story, narrative.&quot; Hindu mythology does not often have a consistent, monolithic structure. The same myth typically appears in various versions, and can be represented differently across different regional and socio-religious traditions. Many of these legends evolve across these texts, where the character names change or the story is embellished with greater details. According to Suthren Hirst, these myths have been given a complex range of interpretations. While according to Doniger O&#x27;Flaherty, the central message and moral values remain the same. They have been modified by various philosophical schools over time, and are taken to have deeper, often symbolic, meaning.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Hinduism:

[[Hinduism]] – predominant and indigenous religious tradition of the Indian Subcontinent. Its followers are called Hindus, who refer to it as &quot;&quot; (), amongst many other expressions. Hinduism has no single founder, and is formed of diverse traditions, including a wide spectrum of laws and prescriptions of &quot;daily morality&quot; based on the notion of karma, dharma, and societal norms. Among its direct roots is the historical Vedic religion of Iron Age India and, as such, Hinduism is often called the &quot;oldest living religion&quot; or the &quot;oldest living major religion&quot; in the world.

<text>A fire drill is a method of practicing how a building should evacuate in the event of a fire or other emergencies. In most cases, the building&#x27;s existing fire alarm system is activated and the building is evacuated by means of the nearest available exits, as if an emergency had actually occurred. Fire drill procedures may vary depending on the building type, such as hospitals or high rise buildings, where occupants may be relocated within the building as opposed to evacuating the building. Generally, the evacuation interval is measured to ensure that it is fast enough, and problems with the emergency system or evacuation procedures are identified so that they may be remedied.

In addition to fire drills, most buildings have their fire alarm systems checked on a regular basis to ensure that the system is working. Fire alarm tests are often done outside normal business hours so as to minimize disruption of building functions; in schools, they are often done when students and staff are not around or during the holidays where specialist fire alarm engineers test alarms in the building for repair if needed.

== History of fire drills ==

The purpose of fire drills in buildings is to ensure that everyone knows how to exit safely as quickly as possible if a fire, smoke, carbon monoxide, or other emergency occurs, and to familiarize building occupants with the sound of the fire alarm.

Before regular fire drills were instituted, an infamous fire broke out at the private Catholic school Our Lady of the Angels in 1958, in Chicago. Children on the second floor were trapped there, with neither teachers nor pupils knowing how to get out of the building safely. Many children jumped out of windows, and many were killed as they could not make their way to an exit. Although the school had passed a fire inspection only two months before, and had the number of fire exits and fire extinguishers required at the time, it lacked smoke detectors or adequate fire alarms, and was overcrowded.

The need for fire drills was recognized; monthly fire drills were implemented after the Our Lady of the Angels fire. It was found in a later study that education on fire also helped to prevent it: people started to learn more about what started fires, and what to do in the case of one starting. They were also aware of the hazards that allow a fire to start and grow. Within a year of the fire, many of the hazardous conditions such as found in Our Lady of the Angels had been eliminated in thousands of schools around the United States.

==Other improvements in fire safety==
After the fire at Our Lady of the Angels, state regulations required that there had to be fire alarm street boxes no more than from the front of the building. The General Assembly of Illinois also passed life safety codes in response to the fire at Our Lady of the Angels. Things such as more control over waste disposal, proper storage of combustible supplies, more frequent fire drills, and inspections were put in place. Other reforms triggered by the fire include the city of Chicago modifying the Municipal Building Code of Chicago, affecting fire safety of schools as well as other buildings with two or more stories. 

To prevent fires and deaths caused by fires, schools must have an evacuation plan in place, and make sure that all the proper fire alarms and warnings work. Teachers must take charge of the situation and act as leaders. Teachers should also consider the number of students that they have, and the need for enough space and time to get all of the students out quickly and safely. Teachers should also be alert to the causes of fires, in order to try and stop them from happening.

== Fire drill regulations ==
Many jurisdictions require that fire drills be conducted at certain intervals. This is the case in educational institutions, and also other workplaces and buildings. The frequency of such drills and what must be done during them may be laid down in statutes.

=== United States ===
In the United States, school fire drill regulations are set by individual states. While all mandate fire drills during the course of a school year, the frequency and number vary from state to state.

The following states require that schools conduct a fire drill once per month:
The following states require that schools conduct a specific number of drills over the course of the entire school year, or that a certain number of drills must be conducted within a certain period of time: 
The following states specify a greater frequency of fire drills at the beginning of the school year:
Until regulations changed on November 1, 2010, New Jersey was unique in its requirement that schools conduct 2 fire drills per month. Under later requirements, one of the 2 fire drills was replaced by a monthly security drill.

=== United Kingdom ===
The National Union of Teachers requires that all schools, colleges and universities and any other education establishment perform a fire evacuation drill every term. It is required that most schools perform a fire drill at the start of the academic year. According to UK fire regulations, any new buildings that were built after the fire safety regulations changed in 2005, every room should have at least one fire alarm device such as a bell, a sounder (siren) or smoke/heat alarm installed. Regular safety checks such as testing fire alarms or smoke alarms and fire extinguishers should be performed weekly and does not require building evacuation. According to the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, all workplaces must have an emergency plan specifying staff actions, evacuation plans and arrangements for contacting the fire brigade.

=== New Zealand ===
The New Zealand Fire Service requires all schools and educational facilities to carry out a fire drill (termed a &quot;trial evacuation&quot;) at least once every six months, unless a shorter period is specified in the school&#x27;s approved evacuation scheme. Schools need to give the Fire Service 7–10 working days&#x27; notice before a fire drill is planned, and must submit a report to the Fire Service within 7–10 working days of the drill; an unplanned alarm activation does not count as a fire drill.

<text>Dyaus (Vedic Sanskrit: द्यौस्, ) or Dyauspitr (Vedic Sanskrit: द्यौष्पितृ, ) is the Rigvedic sky deity. His consort is Prthvi, the earth goddess, and together they are the archetypal parents in the Rigveda.

== Nomenclature ==
 stems from Proto-Indo-Iranian , from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) daylight-sky god , and is cognate with the Greek Διας – &quot;Zeus Patēr&quot;, Illyrian &quot;Dei-pátrous&quot;, and Latin &quot;Jupiter&quot; (from Old Latin Dies piter &quot;Djous patēr&quot;), stemming from the PIE &quot;Dyḗus ph₂tḗr&quot; (&quot;Daylight-sky Father&quot;).&quot;&quot;

The noun (when used without the &#x27;father&#x27;) refers to the daylight sky, and occurs frequently in the Rigveda, as an entity. The sky in Vedic writing was described as rising in three tiers, , , and or .

== Literature ==
Dyáuṣ Pitṛ́ appears in hymns with Prithvi Mata &#x27;Mother Earth&#x27; in the ancient Vedic scriptures of Hinduism.

In the Ṛg·veda, &quot;Dyáuṣ Pitṛ́&quot; appears in verses 1.89.4, 1.90.7, 1.164.33, 1.191.6, 4.1.10. and 4.17.4 He is also referred to under different theonyms: Dyavaprithvi, for example, is a dvandva compound combining &#x27;heaven&#x27; and &#x27;earth&#x27; as Dyauṣ and Prithvi.

Dyauṣ&#x27;s most defining trait is his paternal role. His daughter, Uṣas, personifies dawn. The gods, especially Sūrya, are stated to be the children of Dyauṣ and Prithvi. Dyauṣ&#x27;s other sons include Agni, Parjanya, the Ādityas, the Maruts, and the Angirases. The Ashvins are called &quot;divó nápāt&quot;, meaning offspring/progeny/grandsons of Dyauṣ. Dyauṣ is often visualized as a roaring animal, often a bull, who fertilizes the earth. Dyauṣ is also known for the rape of his own daughter, which, according to Jamison and Brereton (2014), is vaguely but vividly mentioned in the Rigveda.

Dyauṣ is also stated to be like a black stallion studded with pearls in a simile with the night sky.

Indra&#x27;s separation of Dyauṣ and Prithvi is celebrated in the Rigveda as an important creation myth.

<text>Prithvi (Sanskrit: पृथ्वी, &#x27;, also पृथिवी,&#x27;, &quot;the Vast One&quot;, also rendered Pṛthvī Mātā), is the Sanskrit name for the earth, as well as the name of the goddess-personification of it in Hinduism. The goddess Prithvi is an archetypal Mother Goddess, and along with Ushas and Aditi, she is one of the most important goddesses in Vedic Hinduism.

She is depicted as a stable, fertile, and benevolent presence in Vedic literature. She is frequently addressed as a mother, and a nurturing, generous goddess who provides sustenance to all beings living on her vast, firm expanse. While the &quot;Rigveda&quot; predominantly associates her with Dyaus Pita (&#x27;Father Sky&#x27;), the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; and later texts portray her as an independent deity.

In later Hinduism, the figure of Prithvi is supplanted by the goddess Bhumi, while the term Prithvi serves as one of her epithets. She becomes significantly associated with Vishnu, one of the most important gods in later Hinduism, and his avatars—Varaha and Prithu.

Besides Hinduism, Prithvi holds a significant position in Buddhism, symbolising the vastness and support that the Earth provides to all life. Her appearance in the Buddhist tradition is tied to the very moment of Buddha’s enlightenment, and she is considered the first goddess in the Buddhist pantheon.

==Etymology==
Prithvi is the most frequent Vedic word for both the earth and the Earth-goddess; and the poetic formula &quot;kṣā́m ... pṛthivī́m&quot; (&#x27;broad earth&#x27;). The name Pṛthivī (Sanskrit: पृथि्वी) has its roots in Proto-Indo-European mythology, originating from the epithet Plt̥h₂éwih₂, which means &quot;the Broad One.&quot; This term highlights the expansive and nurturing nature of the Earth and forms the basis for the Vedic concept of Pṛthivī Mātā, or &quot;Mother Earth.&quot;

Another connection is found between Prithvi and the mythological figure &quot;Prithu&quot; (Sanskrit: पृथु, &quot;Pṛthu&quot;), who chases the goddess Prthvi, shapeshifted as a cow. His name means &#x27;far, wide, broad&#x27; and in later texts, the term Prithvi is treated as patronym for Earth derived from his name.

==Epithets==
Goddess Prithvi is referred to by various epithets across different religious traditions, particularly in the Vedic and Buddhist contexts. These epithets highlight her nurturing, sustaining, and protective qualities, as well as her connection to truth, fertility, and abundance. Some of the key epithets used for Prithvi are listed below:

* &quot;Medinī&quot; – &#x27;Fertile one&#x27;
* &quot;Janitrī&quot; – &#x27;Birthplace&#x27;
* &quot;Viśvasaṃ&quot; – &#x27;Source of everything&#x27;
* &quot;Viśvaṃśu&quot; – &#x27;Producer of everything&#x27;

* &quot;Ratnavatī&quot; – &#x27;Abounding in jewels&#x27;
* &quot;Vasundharā&quot; – &#x27;Bearer of treasure&#x27;

==In Vedic scriptures ==
Three aspects of the term &quot;Prithvi&quot; appear in the Vedic scriptures: she is the physical earth, the universal mother of creation, and manifest matter that is formed during the cosmogonic process. 
===Rigveda===
In the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, the goddess Prithvi is predominantly associated with the Earth, representing the terrestrial realm where human existence unfolds. However, Prithvi is rarely depicted in isolation. She is most often paired with Dyaus, the male deity representing the sky. This coupling of Prithvi and Dyaus forms the dual entity &quot;Dyavaprithivi&quot;, symbolizing the interconnectedness of the sky and earth. Their unity is so fundamental in the Rigveda that Prithvi is seldom addressed separately, with the two being described as kissing the central point of the world (Rigveda 1.185.5). Their mutual relationship is one of sanctity, as both deities complement each other (4.56.6). Together, they are considered the universal parents, responsible for the creation of the world (1.159) and the gods (1.185).

In this divine partnership, Dyaus is frequently referred to as the father, while Prithvi is recognized as the mother. It is suggested in certain hymns that the two were once inseparable, but later parted by Varuna&#x27;s decree (6.70). Nonetheless, their connection remains strong, with Dyaus fertilising the earth (Prithvi) through rain, although in some instances, they are both credited with providing this nourishment (4.56). While Prithvi is largely associated with the Earth, it is sometimes unclear whether she has a connection to the sky as well. Dyaus and Prithvi are mentioned as the parents of various deities, especially Ushas, though the listing is not consistent throughout the text.

Beyond her maternal and productive attributes, Prithvi (often alongside Dyaus) is revered for her steadfast support. She is described as firm, upholding all that exists (1.185), encompassing everything (6.70), and as broad and vast (1.185). While she is generally characterized as immovable (1.185), other verses describe her as capable of free movement (5.84). Prithvi and Dyaus are also frequently invoked for wealth, prosperity, and strength (6.70). The rains they produce are praised for their richness, fullness, and fertility (1.22), and they are often called upon for protection from harm, forgiveness of sins (1.185), and to bring joy (10.63). Together, Prithvi and Dyaus represent a vast, stable domain of abundance and safety, a realm governed by the cosmic order (&quot;ṛta&quot;), which they nurture and sustain (1.159). They are seen as inexhaustible and full of potential life (6.70).

In a funeral hymn, Prithvi is portrayed as a compassionate and gentle mother, as the deceased is asked to return to her lap. She is implored to cover the dead lightly, as a mother would tenderly cover her child with her garment (10.18.10-12).

===Atharva Veda===
Prithvi is celebrated extensively in the &quot;Atharva Veda&quot;, where she is revered as the queen of all creation. She is referred to as the first water in the ocean, tying her to the primordial elements of existence. This description reinforces her fundamental role in the creation of life and the universe, linking her to fertility, abundance, and sustenance. The &quot;Atharva Veda&quot; highlights Prithvi as a fragrant, life-giving force, but also acknowledges that inherent dangers such as death and disease accompany this creative power. This dual nature emphasizes that while the Earth supports life, it can also bring destruction and hardship, representing the balance between creation and dissolution in the natural world. To avoid or mitigate these dangers, various rituals such as prayers, sacrifices, and the wearing of amulets were performed. This indicates the recognition of Prithvi&#x27;s immense power and the need to maintain harmony with her through devotion and ritualistic appeasement.

One hymn in the &quot;Atharva Veda&quot; claims that Prithvi was germinated from the goddess Aditi, who represents boundlessness or infinity. Aditi is often regarded as the mother of the gods in the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, which further highlights Prithvi’s role as a life-giving force. This connection aligns Prithvi with the cosmic order and fertility, positioning her within a larger framework of divine motherhood in Vedic thought. Similar to earlier Vedic texts, the &quot;Atharva&quot; Veda often presents Prithvi in partnership with Dyaus, the sky god. This pairing symbolizes the unity of heaven and earth, with Dyaus fertilizing Prithvi through rain, allowing life to sprout. Together, they form the universal parents who not only create life on earth but are also responsible for the birth of the gods. 

Like in the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, Prithvi is associated with the cow, called Gauri, which is revered for its milk-giving qualities. The cow is seen as a symbol of nourishment and motherhood, making this connection with Prithvi natural. The earth itself is compared to a cow, with its calves represented by different deities (e.g., Agni and Vayu), symbolizing the interconnectedness of nature and divinity.

====&quot;Pṛthvī Sūkta&quot;====
The most extensive praise of Prithvi in Vedic literature is found in the &quot;Prithvi Sukta&quot; (&quot;Atharvaveda&quot; 12.1). Unlike her depictions in the Rigveda, where she is almost always paired with Dyaus, the Prithvi Sukta is dedicated solely to her. In this hymn, Prithvi is seen as an independent and powerful goddess. Her consort is the mighty god Indra, who is said to protect her from harm. Other gods such as Vishnu, Parjanya, Prajapati, and Vishvakarma also play significant roles in relation to her. Vishnu is said to stride across her vast expanse, while Agni permeates her being.

Despite her close associations with various male deities, the hymn emphasizes Prithvi’s inherent greatness and fertility. She is hailed as the source of all plant life, particularly crops, and as the nourisher of all living creatures. Prithvi is described as patient and resilient, providing sustenance to both the virtuous and the wicked, gods and demons alike. Her nurturing role is further highlighted as she is repeatedly addressed as the mother of all and is asked to offer her nourishment, much like a mother feeding her child. She is likened to a nurse to all living beings, with her breasts full of life-giving nectar.

In the hymn, Prithvi’s life-sustaining energy extends beyond the physical realm. She is said to manifest in the scent of both men and women, embody the fortune and brilliance in men, and represent the vibrant energy of maidens. The hymn also asks for Prithvi’s blessings to ensure long life, invoking her nurturing qualities as central to both life and prosperity.

===Yajurveda===
Prithvi’s role extends to cosmogonic myths, especially in the &quot;Yajuraveda&quot;, where she plays a significant part in the creation process. In the &quot;Yajurveda&quot;, the earth is submerged in the cosmic ocean at the beginning of creation until a boar dives into the waters and brings it to the surface, enabling creation to unfold.

The &quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot; expands the above &quot;Yajuraveda myth&quot; and describes the earth as being created from the waters, with the hymn Atharvaveda 12.1.8 stating that Prithvi was originally water (salila). This cosmogonic role positions the earth as the first material entity formed from the more abstract waters, marking an essential stage in creation.

This myth is seed of the later epic myth of Vishnu’s Varaha (boar) avatara, where the earth (Prithvi, now called Bhumi) is rescued from the depths of the ocean. This myth became a prominent part of later Hindu iconography, where Vishnu, in his boar form, lifts Bhumi out of the cosmic waters. This narrative emphasizes Prithvi&#x27;s vulnerability in later myths and her need for divine protection, further reflecting the dynamic between the earth and the gods.

===Brahmanas===
In the &quot;Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa&quot;, Prithvi’s creation is further elaborated. Prajapati, the creator deity, compresses the shell of the primordial egg and throws it into the waters, leading to the formation of the earth from materials such as clay, mud, sand, and rocks. The earth is then spread out and becomes the foundation of the world, highlighting Prithvi’s role as the material basis of the universe.

Similar to Rigveda, the &quot;Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa&quot; also contains reference to a ritual of the placement of the bones of the deceased in the earth after cremation. According to the Kanda XIII,8,3,3, the text says that &quot;May Savitri deposit thy bones in the mother&#x27;s lap [māturupastha].&#x27; Savitri thus deposits his bones in the lap of the mother [māturupastha], this earth [pṛthivyai]; &#x27;O Earth, be thou propitious unto him!&#x27;&quot;.

Prithvi’s relationship with other cosmic forces is also evident in the &quot;Brahmanas&quot;, where she is identified with Aditi, the mother of the gods. In the &quot;Brahmanas&quot;, Aditi and Prithvi are often conflated, with both representing the physical manifestation of the cosmos. Aditi retains her identity as the cosmic mother, while Prithvi symbolizes the Earth, the tangible, nurturing ground on which all creatures live. In later &quot;Brahmanas&quot;, Prithvi is less abstract than the waters but is similarly viewed as a manifestation of the material matrix of creation. She is no longer paired with Dyaus but with Prajapati, who becomes her mate in the cosmogonic process. This change reflects a shift in her identity from the earlier Vedic depictions, where she was closely associated with Dyaus as part of a divine pair, to her later role as the earth goddess who embodies the physical universe.

==In Post-Vedic scriptures==
In post-Vedic Hindu mythology, the earth goddess Prithvi retains a significant presence, though her role undergoes transformation. In the Vedic period, Prithvi was revered as both the literal earth and a divine being embodying stability, fertility, and the nourishing foundation of all life. As Hindu traditions evolved, Prithvi came to be more commonly known as Bhumi or Bhudevi, meaning &quot;the goddess who is the earth.&quot; Bhudevi plays a central role in Vaishnavite mythology, where she is often portrayed as a supplicant, oppressed by evil forces, demons, or corrupt rulers. These stories frequently depict her appealing to Vishnu for assistance, and in response, Vishnu intervenes to alleviate her distress by taking different avatars or incarnations, reaffirming the bond between the earth goddess and the cosmic protector. In iconography, Bhumi is often depicted as a beautiful lady clinging to the tusk of her consort Varaha, the boar-man incarnation of Vishnu. Alternatively, Vishnu is often shown standing between Bhudevi and Sri-Lakshmi, symbolizing his protection of both the earth and prosperity.

While Bhudevi continues to be revered, her role in later mythology shifts from the Vedic portrayal of the earth as the stable, fertile ground supporting all life. In the Rigvedic hymns, Prithvi is exalted for her boundless fertility and capacity to sustain all creatures. However, in medieval texts, these qualities are transferred to other goddesses, such as Shakambhari, Lakshmi, and Mahadevi, while Bhudevi&#x27;s primary role becomes that of a distressed earth, burdened by the weight of wickedness and seeking divine intervention. This transformation highlights Bhudevi’s evolution from an embodiment of the fertile and life-sustaining earth to a more vulnerable figure who requires divine support in times of crisis.

==Role and significance==
===The Universal Mother===
One of the most prominent aspects of Prithvi is her depiction as the universal mother. Scholars have all emphasized Prithvi’s maternal nature, often drawing on her portrayal in the Rigveda and Atharva Veda. David Kinsley highlights how Prithvi, often paired with Dyaus, the sky deity, is addressed as the mother of all creatures, providing nourishment and stability to all living beings. Her role as the earth that sustains life is central to her identity, with her vast, firm, and motionless presence symbolizing the stability of the world itself. Pintchman similarly explores how Prithvi is revered as the life-supporting earth, with the Atharva Veda portraying her as the maternal source of creation, asked to pour forth milk like a mother nourishing her child. Wangu adds that while Prithvi is a nurturing mother, her duality also reflects the dangers inherent in creation, such as disease and death, balancing her life-giving aspects with the destructive forces of nature.
===Creation===
Prithvi’s role in the process of creation is another significant theme in the scholarship. Kinsley notes that in the Vedic worldview, Prithvi and Dyaus are considered the universal parents responsible for the creation of the gods and the world. As Hindu cosmology evolved, Prithvi took on an independent role in creation, symbolizing the materialization of the cosmos itself. Pintchman delves into Prithvi’s connection with the cosmogonic waters, highlighting her depiction in the Yajur Veda, where she is lifted from the primordial waters during creation. This mythological narrative underscores Prithvi’s role as the physical manifestation of the cosmos, emerging as the first form of materiality from which life would develop.
===Fertility===
Prithvi’s association with fertility is central to her significance as a goddess. Kinsley points out that in Vedic literature, Prithvi’s fertility is often praised, particularly in relation to her role as the source of plants and crops. Her nurturing qualities are symbolized by her breasts, which are said to be full of nectar, providing nourishment to all creatures. Pintchman also highlights the Atharva Veda’s invocation to Prithvi to pour forth milk and nectar, reinforcing her function as the provider of material abundance. In this capacity, Prithvi embodies the fertility of the earth, ensuring the sustenance of both nature and humanity. Her identity as the giver of life ties directly to her status as a maternal and fertile goddess.
===Cosmic Stability===
Prithvi’s role in maintaining cosmic stability is another key aspect of her identity. Kinsley notes that in Vedic hymns, Prithvi is often invoked for her firm, motionless presence, symbolizing the stability of the earth and the maintenance of rta, the cosmic order. As the foundation of the physical world, Prithvi, along with Dyaus, ensures the orderliness and safety of the universe. Pintchman extends this notion by discussing Prithvi’s place in the Satapatha Brahmana, where she is described as the material manifestation of creation, providing the stable ground upon which life can flourish. In this sense, Prithvi is not just a physical entity but a symbol of cosmic balance and order.

=== &quot;Prakṛti&quot; ===
The concept of Prithvi also intersects with the philosophical idea of the Prakriti-Purusha duality, which is fundamental to the Samkhya system of thought and later Hindu philosophy. David Leeming, Christopher Fee and other scholars note that Prithvi can be seen as a manifestation of Prakriti—the material, feminine principle that is the source of creation and the foundation of the manifest universe. Prakriti is often paired with Purusha, the male principle representing consciousness or spirit. Wangu points out that this pairing can be understood as a development of the earlier Dyaus-Prithvi duality from Vedic literature, where Dyaus (sky) and Prithvi (earth) were the universal parents. In this later philosophical context, Prithvi, as Prakriti, represents the material energy that brings Purusha’s consciousness into manifestation.

Thus, Prithvi’s role in the Prakriti-Purusha concept positions her as more than just a nurturing earth mother. She becomes a central figure in the metaphysical understanding of the universe, symbolizing the dynamic, creative force that makes the world tangible. This philosophical idea reverberates through Hindu cosmology, linking the goddess to the very processes of creation, preservation, and dissolution in the universe.
===National Imagery===
In his analysis, David Kinsley discusses how the concept of Prithvi Mata transforms in later traditions, particularly in the context of Bharat Mata (Mother India), which became a powerful symbol in India’s nationalist movement. Kinsley highlights that the reverence for the land as sacred extends from early Vedic hymns to the modern conceptualization of India itself as a divine mother figure. The image of Prithvi, or Bhudevi, as the Earth Goddess who nurtures and supports life, easily transitioned into a national personification during the Indian independence movement. This modern depiction draws on the ancient idea that the earth is not merely a physical entity but a living, nurturing force. Kinsley connects this with the imagery of Anandamath, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee&#x27;s novel, where the goddess appears as a symbol of the motherland, and devotees are called upon to protect her at any cost. This reflects the continuity of Prithvi&#x27;s role as the protective, nurturing mother figure—this time, embodying the Indian subcontinent itself.

Owing to strong historical Hindu influence, the name Prithvi is also used for national personification of Indonesia, where she is referred to as Ibu Pertiwi.

==In Buddhism==

Prithvi was adopted into Buddhism, and plays a vital role in it, regarded as the first goddess appearing in Early Buddhism in the Pāli Canon. Her essential qualities—nurturing, sustaining, and upholding cosmic order—remained intact, but her role was transformed to fit the Buddhist cosmology.

Prithvi&#x27;s most notable role in Buddhist tradition is during the moment of Shakyamuni Buddha’s enlightenment, known as the &quot;Maravijaya&quot; (Victory over Mara). As the Bodhisattva Siddhartha Gautama meditated under the Bodhi tree, Mara, the king of demons, sought to prevent his enlightenment by questioning his worthiness and sending an army to disrupt him. When Mara challenged Siddhartha to provide evidence of his past virtuous deeds, the Bodhisattva touched the Earth with his right hand, displaying what is known as the &quot;earth-touching gesture&quot; (bhumisparśa mudra), invoking Prithvi as a witness. Prithvi emerged from the Earth, and dispelled Mara’s forces. This act confirmed that Siddhartha’s journey toward enlightenment was righteous, rooted in the ethical and compassionate life he had lived through many past lifetimes. By calling Prithvi as a witness, Siddhartha demonstrated that enlightenment is not just a spiritual achievement but also deeply connected to one’s actions on Earth. In some versions of the story, such as in the &quot;Nidanakatha&quot;, she verbally testified to the Bodhisattva’s virtues. In other accounts, like the &quot;Mahavastu&quot;, her response was more physical, as she caused the Earth to shake, terrifying Mara’s forces. In the &quot;Lalitavistara&quot;, Prithvi appears in bodily form, emerging from the Earth with her retinue of goddesses. Her presence and the subsequent quaking of the Earth defeated Mara’s armies and created the peaceful environment necessary for the Buddha to attain enlightenment.

Prithvi’s role extends beyond being a moral witness. She is also intimately tied to the throne of enlightenment, where the Buddha attained liberation. This symbolic location, often referred to as the navel of the Earth or &quot;vajrāsana&quot;, is seen as the center of the world, where the spiritual and material realms converge. Prithvi’s association with this spot signifies her importance in the Buddha’s journey, as it was only at this exact location, the most stable and sacred place on Earth, that Shakyamuni Buddha could achieve enlightenment. In this sense, Prithvi provides not only moral support but also the physical foundation for the Buddha’s final realization.

In Buddhist art, Prithvi is often depicted at the base of the Buddha’s throne during the moment of his enlightenment. The Gandharan reliefs from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE frequently portray her emerging from the Earth with her head and torso visible, symbolizing her connection to nature and her role as a stabilizing force. She is sometimes shown with a vase of plenty, brimming with jewels or lotuses, representing her abundance and nurturing qualities.
Later, in the Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries CE), Prithvi is also depicted holding a vessel, symbolizing the spiritual and material wealth that she nurtures. In some Southeast Asian traditions, she wrings water from her hair which drowns Mara&#x27;s army, symbolizing the spiritual merit accumulated by the Buddha over many lifetimes.

In Chinese Buddhism, she is considered one of the Twenty-Four Protective Deities (二十四諸天 Èrshísì zhūtiān) and is usually enshrined in the Mahavira Hall of Buddhist temples along with the other devas.

<text>Asuras () are a class of beings in Indian religions, and later Persian and Turkic mythology. They are described as power-seeking beings related to the more benevolent Devas (also known as Suras) in Hinduism. In its Buddhist context, the word is translated as &quot;titan&quot; or &quot;&quot;.

According to Hindu texts, the asuras are in constant fear of the devas. Asuras are described in Indian texts as powerful superhuman demigods with good or bad qualities. In early Vedic literature, the good Asuras are called &quot;Adityas&quot; and are led by Varuna, while the malevolent ones are called &quot;Danavas&quot; and are led by Vritra. 
In the earliest layer of Vedic texts, Agni, Indra and other gods are also called Asuras, in the sense of their being &quot;lords&quot; of their respective domains, knowledge and abilities. In later Vedic and post-Vedic texts, the benevolent gods are called &quot;Devas&quot;, while malevolent Asuras compete against these Devas and are considered &quot;enemy of the gods&quot;.

Asuras are part of Hinduism along with Yakshas (nature spirits), Rakshasas (fierce man-eating beings or demons), Bhutas (ghosts) and many more. Asuras have been featured in many cosmological theories and legends in Hinduism and Buddhism.

==Etymology==

=== Traditional etymologies ===
Asura is a given name by Devas to other races collectively as &quot;Asura&quot; means&quot; not-sura&quot;, where &quot;sura&quot; is another name for Devas.

The 5th century Buddhist philosopher Buddhaghosa explains that their name derives from the myth of their defeat at the hands of the god Śakra. According to the story, the asura were dispossessed of their state in Trāyastriṃśa because they became drunk and were thrown down Mount Sumeru. After this incident, they vowed never to drink sura again. In some Buddhist literature, they are sometimes referred to as &quot;pūrvadeva&quot; (Pāli: &quot;pubbadeva&quot;), meaning &quot;ancient gods.&quot;

=== Modern theories ===
Monier-Williams traces the etymological roots of &quot;asura&quot; () to &quot;asu&quot; (), which means &#x27;life of the spiritual world&#x27; or &#x27;departed spirits&#x27;.

In the oldest verses of the Samhita layer of Vedic texts, the &quot;Asuras&quot; are any spiritual, divine beings including those with good or bad intentions, and constructive or destructive inclinations or nature. In later verses of the Samhita layer of Vedic texts, Monier Williams states the &quot;Asuras&quot; are &quot;evil spirits, demons and opponents of the gods&quot;. Asuras connote the chaos-creating evil, in Indo-Iranian mythology about the battle between good and evil.

According to Finnish Indologist Asko Parpola, the word &quot;Asura&quot; was borrowed from Proto-Indo-Aryan into Proto-Uralic during an early period of contact, in the form *asera-, showing a meaning &quot;lord, prince&quot;.

== In Hindu literature ==

=== &quot;Rig Veda&quot; ===
Bhargava states the word, &quot;asura&quot;, including its variants, &quot;asurya&quot; and &quot;asura&quot;, occurs &quot;88 times in the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, 71 times in the singular number, 4 times in the dual, 10 times in the plural, and 3 times as the first member of a compound. In this, the feminine form, &quot;asuryaa&quot;, is included twice. The word, &quot;asurya&quot;, has been used 19 times as an abstract noun, while the abstract form &quot;asuratva&quot; occurs 24 times, 22 times in one hymn and twice each in two other hymns&quot;.

Bhargava gives a count of the word use for every Vedic deity: &quot;Asura&quot; is used as an adjective meaning &quot;powerful&quot; or &quot;mighty&quot;. In the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, two generous kings – as well as some priests – have been described as &quot;asuras&quot;. One hymn requests a son who is an &quot;asura&quot;. In nine hymns, Indra is described as &quot;asura&quot;. He is said to possess &quot;asurya&quot; 5 times, and once he is said to possess &quot;asuratva&quot;. Agni has total of 12 &quot;asura&quot; descriptions, Varuna has 10, Mitra has 8, and Rudra has 6. Book 1 of the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; describes Savitr (Vedic solar deity) as an &quot;asura&quot; who is a &quot;kind leader&quot;.

=== Samaveda ===
In the Jaiminya (3.35.3), one of three recensions of the SamaVeda, the term &#x27;Asura&#x27; is stated to be derived from &#x27;rests&#x27; (√ram) in the vital airs (asu), i.e. &#x27;Asu&#x27; + &#x27;ram&#x27; = &#x27;Asuram&#x27; (Asura); this is in reference to the mind being &#x27;asura[-like]&#x27;.

=== Mahabharata ===
According to the Bhagavad Gita (16.6-16.7), all beings in the universe have both the divine qualities (&quot;daivi sampad&quot;) and the demonic qualities (&quot;asuri sampad&quot;) within each. The sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita states that pure god-like saints are rare and pure demon-like evil are rare among human beings, and the bulk of humanity is multi-charactered with a few or many faults. According to Jeaneane Fowler, the Gita states that desires, aversions, greed, needs, emotions in various forms &quot;are facets of ordinary lives&quot;, and it is only when they turn to lust, hate, cravings, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, hypocrisy, cruelty and such negativity- and destruction-inclined that natural human inclinations metamorphose into something demonic (Asura).

=== Brahmanda Purana ===

In the Brahmanda Purana, it is stated the term &#x27;Asura&#x27; was used for the Daityas due to their rejection of Varuni (Goddess of Wine) after she emerged from the Ocean of Milk (i.e. &#x27;a-sura&#x27;, meaning &#x27;those who do not have &quot;Sura&quot;&#x27;, that is, &#x27;wine&#x27; or more generally &#x27;liquor&#x27;). However, in other legends, the Asuras accept Varuni (see Kurma).
===Vishnu Purana===
According to the Vishnu Purana, during the Samudra Manthana or the &quot;churning of the ocean&quot;, the daityas came to be known as &quot;asuras&quot; because they rejected Varuni, the goddess of &quot;sura&quot; &quot;wine&quot;, while the devas accepted her and came to be known as suras.

===Shiva Purana===
Alain Daniélou states that Asuras were initially good, virtuous and powerful in Indian mythology. However, their nature gradually changed and they came to represent evil, vice and abuse of power. In Shiva Purana, they evolved into anti-gods and had to be destroyed because they threatened the gods.

The asuras (anti-gods) were depicted to have become proud, vain, to have stopped performing sacrifices, to violate sacred laws, not visit holy places, not cleanse themselves from sin, to be envious of devas, torturous of living beings, creating confusion in everything and challenging the devas.

Alain Daniélou states that the concept of &quot;asuras&quot; evolved with changing socio-political dynamics in ancient India. Asuras gradually assimilated the demons, spirits, and ghosts worshipped by the enemies of Vedic people, and this created the myths of the malevolent &quot;asuras&quot; and the &quot;rakshasa&quot;. The allusions to the disastrous wars between the &quot;asuras&quot; and the &quot;suras&quot;, found in the Puranas and the epics, may be the conflict faced by people and migrants into ancient India.

==Context==
Scholars have disagreed on the nature and evolution of the &quot;Asura&quot; concept in ancient Indian literature. The most widely studied scholarly views on &quot;Asura&quot; concept are those of F.B.J. Kuiper, W. Norman Brown, Haug, von Bradke, Otto, Benveniste, Konow, Rajwade, Dandekar, Darmesteter, Bhandarkar, and Raja, Banerji-Sastri, Padmanabhayya, Skoeld, S.C. Roy, Kumaraswamy, Shamasastry, Przyluski, Schroeder, Burrows, Hillebrandt, Taraporewala, Lommel, Fausboll, Segerstedt, Thieme, Gerschevitch, Boyce, Macdonnell, Hermann Oldenberg, Geldner, Venkatesvaran, and Jan Gonda.

Kuiper calls &quot;Asuras&quot; a special group of gods in one of major Vedic theories of creation of the universe. Their role changes only during and after the earth, sky and living beings have been created. The sky world becomes that of &quot;Devas&quot;, the underworld becomes that of &quot;Asuras&quot;. The god Indra is the embodiment of good and represents the Devas, while the dragon Vrtra is the embodiment of evil and an Asura. During this battle between good and evil, creation and destruction, some powerful Asuras side with the good and are called Devas, other powerful Asuras side with the evil and thereafter called Asuras. This is the first major dualism to emerge in the nature of everything in the Universe. , in his review, states that Kuiper&#x27;s theory on Asura is plausible, but weak, because the Vedas never call Vrtra (the central character) an &quot;Asura&quot;, as the texts describe many other powerful beings. Secondly, &quot;Rig Veda&quot; never classifies Asura as &quot;group of gods&quot; states Hale, and this is a presumption of Kuiper.

Many scholars describe Asuras to be &quot;lords&quot; with different specialized knowledge, magical powers and special abilities, which only later choose to deploy these for good, constructive reasons or for evil, destructive reasons. The former become known as Asura in the sense of &quot;Devas&quot;, the later as Asura in the sense of demons. Kuiper, Brown, Otto and others are in this school; however, none of them provide an explanation and how, when and why Asura came ultimately to mean demon. Asuras are non-believers of God and believe in their own powers.

Ananda Coomaraswamy suggested that Devas and Asuras can be best understood as being similar in concept to the Twelve Olympians and the titans of Greek mythology: Both are powerful, but have different orientations and inclinations – in Hindu mythology the Devas represent the powers of light and the Asuras represent the powers of darkness. According to &quot;the titan [Asura] is potentially an angel [Deva], the angel still by nature a titan&quot; in Hinduism.

===Indo-Aryan context===
In the 19th century, Haug pioneered the idea that the term &quot;Asura&quot; is linguistically related to the Ahuras of Indo-Aryan people and pre-Zoroastrianism era. In both religions, &quot;Ahura&quot; of pre-Zoroastrianism (&quot;Asura&quot; of Indian religions), Vouruna (Varuna) and &quot;Daeva&quot; (&quot;Deva&quot;) are found, but their roles are on opposite sides. That is, &quot;Ahura&quot; evolves to represent the good in pre-Zoroastrianism, while &quot;Asura&quot; evolves to represent the bad in Vedic religion; where &quot;Daeva&quot; evolves to represent the bad in pre-Zoroastrianism, while &quot;Deva&quot; evolves to represent the good in Vedic religion. These contrary roles have led some scholars to infer that there may have been wars between proto-Indo-European communities, and that adapted their gods and demons to reflect their social differences. This idea was thoroughly researched and reviewed by Peter von Bradke in 1885.

The relationship between &quot;ahura&quot;s / &quot;asura&quot;s and &quot;daeva&quot;s / &quot;deva&quot;s in Indo-Aryan times, was discussed at length by F.B.J. Kuiper. This theory and other Avesta-related hypotheses developed over the 20th century, are all now in question, particularly for lack of archaeological evidence. Asko Parpola has re-opened this debate by presenting archaeological and linguistic evidence, but notes that the links may go earlier to Uralic languages roots. The Indo-Aryan &quot;Asura&quot; may also be related to the Assyrian deity &quot;Ashur&quot;.

===Relation to Germanic deities===

Some scholars such as Asko Parpola suggest that the word &quot;Asura&quot; may be related to proto-Uralic and proto-Germanic history. The Aesir-Asura correspondence is the relation between Vedic Sanskrit &quot;Asura&quot; and Old Norse &quot;Æsir&quot; and Proto-Uralic *&quot;asera&quot;, all of which mean &#x27;lord, powerful spirit, god&#x27;. Parpola states that the correspondence extends beyond Asera / Asura, and extends to a host of parallels such as Inmar-Indra, Sampas-Stambha and many other elements of respective mythologies.

==Characteristics==
In the earliest Vedic literature, all supernatural beings are called Devas and Asuras. A much-studied hymn of the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; states &quot;Devav asura&quot; (Asuras who have become Devas), and contrasts it with &quot;Asura adevah&quot; (Asuras who are not Devas). Each Asura and Deva emerges from the same father (&quot;Prajapati&quot;), share the same residence (&quot;Loka&quot;), eat together the same food and drinks (&quot;Soma&quot;), and have innate potential, knowledge and special powers in Hindu mythology; the only thing that distinguishes &quot;Asura who become Deva&quot; from &quot;Asura who remain Asura&quot; is intent, action and choices they make in their mythic lives.

&quot;Asuras who remain Asura&quot; share the character of powerful beings obsessed with their craving for ill-gotten &quot;Soma&quot;, and for wealth, ego, anger, unprincipled nature, force, and violence. Further, in Hindu mythology, when they lose, miss, or don&#x27;t get what they want (because they were distracted by their cravings) the &quot;Asuras who remain Asuras&quot; question, challenge, and attack the &quot;Asuras who became Devas&quot; to loot or extract a portion of what the Devas have and the Asuras do not.

The hostility between the two groups is the source of extensive legends, tales, and literature in Hinduism; however, many texts discuss their hostility in neutral terms – without explicit moral connotations or condemnation. Some of these tales constitute the background of major Hindu Epics and annual festivals, such as the story of Asura Ravana and Deva Rama in the Ramayana, and the legend of Asura Hiranyakashipu and Deva Vishnu as Narasimha, the latter celebrated with the Hindu spring festival of Holika and Holi.

In Buddhist mythology, while all the gods of the Kāmadhātu are subject to passions to some degree, the asuras above all are addicted to them, especially wrath, pride, envy, insincerity, falseness, boasting, and bellicosity. The asuras are said to experience a much more pleasurable life than humans, but they are plagued by envy for the devas, whom they can see just as animals perceive humans.

==Symbolism==

Edelmann and other scholars state that the dualistic concept of Asura and Deva in Hinduism is a form of symbolism found throughout its ancient and medieval literature. In the Upanishads, for example, Devas and Asuras go to Prajāpati to understand what is Self (Atman, soul) and how to realize it. The first answer that Prajāpati gives is simplistic, which the Asuras accept and leave with, but the Devas led by Indra do not accept and question because Indra finds that he hasn&#x27;t grasped its full significance and the given answer has inconsistencies. Edelmann states that this symbolism embedded in the Upanishads is a reminder that one must struggle with presented ideas, learning is a process, and Deva nature emerges with effort. Similar dichotomies are present in the Puranas literature of Hinduism, where god Indra (a Deva) and the antigod Virocana (an Asura) question a sage for insights into the knowledge of the self. Virocana leaves with the first given answer, believing now he can use the knowledge as a weapon. In contrast, Indra keeps pressing the sage, churning the ideas, and learning about means to inner happiness and power. Edelmann suggests that the Deva-Asura dichotomies in Hindu mythology may be seen as &quot;narrative depictions of tendencies within our selves&quot;.

The god (Deva) and antigod (Asura), states Edelmann, are also symbolically the contradictory forces that motivate each individual and people, and thus Deva-Asura dichotomy is a spiritual concept rather than mere genealogical category or species of being. In the Bhāgavata Purana, saints and gods are born in families of Asuras, such as Mahabali and Prahlada, conveying the symbolism that motivations, beliefs and actions rather than one&#x27;s birth and family circumstances define whether one is Deva-like or Asura-like.

==Asuri==

Asuri is the feminine of an adjective from asura and in later texts means &#x27;belonging to or having to do with demons and spirits&#x27;. Asuri parallels Asura in being &quot;powerful beings&quot;, and in early Vedic texts includes all goddesses. The term Asuri also means a Rakshasi in Indian texts.

The powers of an Asuri are projected into plants offering a remedy against leprosy.

In Book 7, &quot;Asuri&quot; is a powerful female with the special knowledge of herbs, who uses that knowledge to seduce Deva Indra in Atharva Veda. A hymn invokes this special power in &quot;Asuri&quot;, and this hymn is stipulated for a woman as a charm to win over the lover she wants.

Similarly, in the Atharva Veda, all sorts of medical remedies and charms are projected as Asuri manifested in plants and animals. Asuri Kalpa is an &quot;abhichara&quot; (craft) which contains various rites derived from special knowledge and magic of Asuri.

==Buddhism==
Asuras (; ; ) are a type of supernatural beings (anti-gods, demigods, or non-god titans) in traditional Buddhist cosmology and a realm of rebirth based on one&#x27;s karma in current or past lives. They are described in Buddhist texts as creatures who live in lower levels of mount Sumeru, obsessed with sensuous aspects of existence, living with jealousy, and endlessly engaged in wars against the creatures who are &quot;Devas&quot; (gods). As Buddhism spread into East Asia and Southeast Asia, the Asura concept of Indian Buddhism expanded and integrated local pre-existing deities as a part of regional Buddhist pantheon.

=== Asura realm ===
The asura realm is one of the realms in which one can be reborn as a result of experiencing the fruits of wholesome karma, while engaging in unwholesome karma. Generally, the desire realm is recognized as consisting of five realms and the realm of the asuras tends to be included among the deva realms, but the addition of the asuras in the six-world bhavacakra was created in Tibet at the authority of Je Tsongkhapa.

=== Deva-Asura War ===
The asuras were dispossessed of their state in Trāyastriṃśa because they became drunk and were thrown down Mount Sumeru by the bodhisatta, as mentioned in Jatakas. This led to ever lasting war between the Devas of Tavatimsa and Asuras, which still continues.

=== Asurendra ===
In Buddhism, the leaders of the asuras are called &quot;asurendra&quot; (Pāli: Asurinda, 阿修羅王; lit. &quot;Asura-lord&quot;). There are several of these, as the Asuras are broken into different tribes or factions.  In Pali texts, names that are found include &quot;Vepacitti&quot;, &quot;Rāhu&quot; (&quot;Verocana&quot;), &quot;Pahārāda&quot;, &quot;Sambara&quot;, &quot;Bali&quot;, &quot;Sucitti&quot;, and &quot;Namucī&quot;. According to the Lotus Sutra, the four leaders of the asuras took refuge in the Buddha after hearing his sermon.

<text>Mucilinda (; Pali: &quot;Mucalinda&quot;) is a nāga who protected Śākyamuni Buddha from the elements after his enlightenment.

It is said that six weeks after Gautama Buddha began meditating under the Bodhi Tree, the heavens darkened for seven days, and a prodigious rain descended. However, the mighty King of Serpents, Mucilinda, came from beneath the earth and protected with his hood the One who is the source of all protection. When the great storm had cleared, the serpent king assumed his human form, bowed before the Buddha, and returned in joy to his palace.

==Development==
Mucalinda first appears in the &quot;Mucalinda Sutta&quot;, where it is described that the naga king protected Buddha from the elements by encircling Buddha&#x27;s body seven times with his coils and standing with his hood spread over. Generally we find statues and carvings of Muchalinda with seven heads, as discovered at the Ta Prohm-temple in Cambodia, in September 2024. After Buddha finished meditating and the sky cleared, Mucalinda adopted the form of a youth and bowed before him.

The first existent artwork depicting Mucalinda comes from a 2nd-century BC stupa in Pauni, Maharashtra, where the naga is portrayed as having five heads and guarding Buddha&#x27;s empty seat. Contemporaneous artwork from Sanchi has him portrayed in zoo-anthropomorphic form and attended by a retinue of nagini.

==Mahayana==
According to the Lalitavistara Sutra, the Buddha found himself in the domain of Mucilinda five weeks after his enlightenment. Mucilinda, along with nāgas from the four cardinal directions, approached him and coiled around his body seven times to shelter him from the inclement weather. They did so for seven days and seven nights. After the storm had let up, the nāgas returns to their respective domains and Mucilinda paid homage to the Buddha, circumambulating him three times before departing.

==Artistic representations==

The subject of Buddha meditating under the protection of Mucalinda is very common in Lao Buddhist art. A particularly striking gigantic modern rendition is present in Bunleua Sulilat&#x27;s sculpture park Sala Keoku.

Art depicting Buddha with Mucalinda&#x27;s hood over him might have been influenced by Jain art of Parshvanatha, himself depicted as a man with a cobra-like hood.

<doc id="99574" wikidata="Q2418874" url="?curid=99574" title="Shesha">
<text>Shesha (), also known by his epithets Sheshanaga () and Adishesha (), is a serpentine demigod (naga) and king of the serpents (Nagaraja), as well as a primordial being of creation in Hinduism. In the Puranas, Shesha is said to hold all the planets of the universe on his hoods and to constantly sing the glories of Vishnu from all his mouths. He is sometimes referred to as Ananta Shesha.

The Narayana form of Vishnu is often depicted as resting on Shesha, accompanied by his consort Lakshmi. Shesha is considered as one of the two mounts of Vishnu alongside Garuda. He is said to have descended upon Earth in the following human forms or incarnations: Lakshmana, brother of Vishnu&#x27;s incarnation Rama during the Treta Yuga, and according to some traditions, as Balarama, brother of Vishnu&#x27;s incarnation Krishna during the Dvapara Yuga. According to the Mahabharata (Adi Parva), his father was Kashyapa and his mother Kadru, though in other accounts, he is usually a primordial being created by Vishnu. 

His name means &quot;he who remains&quot;, from the Sanskrit root &quot;śiṣ&quot;, because even as the world is destroyed at the end of each kalpa, Shesha remains as he is.

==Form==
Shesha is generally depicted with a massive form that floats coiled through space, or upon the Ocean of Milk, to form the bed upon which Vishnu lies. Sometimes, he is depicted as a five-headed or seven-headed or a ten-headed serpent; but more commonly as one thousand-headed, or five thousand-headed, or even as many as a one million-headed serpent; sometimes with each head wearing an ornate crown.

== Origin and legends ==
According to the Mahabharata, Shesha was born to the sage Kashyapa and his wife Kadru. Kadru gave birth to a thousand snakes, of which Shesha was the eldest. After Shesha, Vasuki, Iravati and Takshaka were born, in that order. A lot of Shesha&#x27;s brothers were cruel and were bent upon inflicting harm on others. They were even unkind to Garuda, who was Kashyapa&#x27;s son through Vinata, sister of Kadru. (Kadru and Vinata were daughters of Daksha).

Shesha, disgusted by the cruel acts of his brothers, left his mother and kin, and took on austere penances. He lived on air and meditated in places including Gandhamadhana, Badrikashrama, Gokarna, Pushkara, and the Himalayas. His penances were so severe that his flesh, skin, and muscles dried up and merged with his frame. Brahma, convinced of Shesha&#x27;s will, asked Shesha to request a boon. Shesha asked that he be able to keep his mind under control so that he could continue to perform ascetic penances. Brahma gladly accepted the request. Brahma then asked a favour of Shesha: to go beneath the precarious earth and stabilise it. Shesha agreed and went to the netherworld and stabilised Bhumi with his hood. He is believed to support her even today, thus making Patala his perennial residence.

===Vishnu and Shesha===

Shesha is usually depicted as floating in the ocean of the changing world, forming the bed of a primordial form of Vishnu, i.e. Narayana, Vāsudeva or in later Puranic Vaishnavism, Mahavishnu.

In the Bhagavata Purana, Shesha is named Sankarshana, the tamasic energy of Narayana himself, and is said to live deep within the inner layers of Patala, where there are many serpents with gems on their heads and where he reigns as its ruler. He is said to have existed before the creation of the universe. When the universe is towards its end, he creates the 11 Rudras from the serpents to destroy the universe for a new one to be created.

Sankarshana is also one of the four vyuhas, or primitive forms of Vishnu, the other three being Vasudeva, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha.

In Gaudiya accounts, Sankarshana expands himself as Garbhodakshayi-Vishnu in the beginning of the universe to create Brahma. In other words, Sankarshana is believed to be Narayana himself.

In the first few chapters of the Puranas, it is also said that Sankarshana preached the Bhagavata to the Four Kumaras, who in turn passed on this message. At some point, the message was passed to sage Maitreya, who in turn preached it to Vidura.

===Marriage===
According to legends, Shesha is married to Nagalakshmi. As per the &quot;Garga Samhita&quot;, she is considered to be the personification of the divine ocean called the Kshira Sagara.

==Avatars ==

Shesha is believed to have taken six incarnations on earth. During the Satya Yuga, he came down in his original form to form a seat for Vishnu&#x27;s avatar of Narasimha, who had incarnated to slay the impious Hiranyakashipu.

During the Treta Yuga, Shesha took birth as Lakshmana, as Vishnu&#x27;s (as Rama) brother. Lakshmana is a very prominent character in the Ramayana, along with Hanuman and Sita. His consort, Nagalakshmi was born as Urmila, the sister of Sita. 

During Dvapara Yuga, he is a stated to have incarnated as Balarama again as a brother to Vishnu (as Krishna). This is often disputed by the original line-ups of the Dasavatara, where Balarama is also considered to be an incarnation of Vishnu. His consort was born as Revati, the daughter of King Kakudmi. 

During the Kali Yuga, according to Sri Vaishnava tradition, he was born as Patanjali, Ramanuja, and Manavala Mamunigal. He was not accompanied by God during the Kali Yuga. Instead, he incarnated alone to spread devotion among the people, being a peaceful incarnation.

Sri Vaishnavism also states that Balarama is an incarnation of both Vishnu and Shesha. In the Bhagavad Gita, in the middle of the battlefield Kurukshetra, Krishna, explaining his omnipresence, says: &quot;Of Nāgas, I am Ananta&quot; indicating the importance of Shesha.

Gaudiya Vaishnavism states that Shesha incarnated as Nityananda, a friend and associate of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who is described as an incarnation of Krishna. According to the texts and scriptures of the Gaudiya Sampradaya, the appearance of Nityananda Prabhu was very similar to Balarama (incarnation of Shesha).

==Literature==
The Brahma Purana describes the attributes of Ananta:

The Brahmanda Purana also described Shesha in Patala:
The Bhagavata Purana equates Shesha and Balarama:

In the Bhagavad Gita chapter 10, verse 29, Krishna describes 75 of his common manifestations, and declares, : &quot;Among Nāgas (a special class of serpents), I am the serpent-god Ananta&quot;.

<text>Balarama (, ) is a Hindu god, and the elder brother of Krishna. He is particularly significant in the Jagannath tradition, as one of the triad deities. He is also known as Haladhara, Halayudha, Baladeva, Balabhadra, and Sankarshana. 

The first two epithets associate him with &quot;hala&quot; (&quot;langala&quot;, &quot;plough&quot;) from his strong associations with farming and farmers, as the deity who used farm equipment as weapons when needed, and the next two refer to his strength.

Originally an agri-cultural deity, Balarama is mostly described as an incarnation of Adi Shesha, the serpent associated with the deity Vishnu while some Vaishnava traditions regard him as the eighth avatar of Vishnu, with Jayadeva’s Gitagovinda (c.1200) &quot;incorporat[ing] Balarama into the pantheon&quot; as the ninth of the 10 principal avatars of Vishnu.

Balarama&#x27;s significance in Indian culture has ancient roots. His image in artwork is dated to around the start of the common era, and in coins dated to the second-century BCE. In Jainism, he is known as Baladeva, and has been a historically significant farmer-related deity.

==History==
Balarama is an ancient deity, a prominent one by the epics era of Indian history as evidenced by archeological and numismatic evidence. His iconography appears with Nāga (many-headed serpent), a plough and other farm artifacts such as a watering pot, possibly indicating his origins in a bucolic, agricultural culture. 

===Texts===
Narratives of Balarama are found in &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Harivamsha&quot;, &quot;Bhagavata Purana,&quot; and other Puranas. He is identified with the vyuha avatar of Sankarshana, along with the deities of Shesha and Lakshmana. The legend of Balarama as the avatar of Shesha, the demigod-serpent Vishnu rests upon, reflects his role and association with Vishnu. However, Balarama&#x27;s mythology and his association with the ten avatars of Vishnu is relatively younger and post-Vedic, because it is not found in the Vedic texts.

Balarama&#x27;s legend appears in many &quot;Parva&quot; (books) of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Book Three (Vana Parva) states about Krishna and him that Balarama is an avatar of Vishnu, while Krishna is the source of all avatars and existence. In some art works of the Vijayanagara Empire, temples of Gujarat and elsewhere, for example, Baladeva is the eighth avatar of Vishnu, prior to the Buddha (Buddhism) or Arihant (Jainism).

Balarama finds a mention in Kautilya&#x27;s Arthashastra (4th to 2nd century BCE), where according to Hudson, his followers are described as &quot;ascetic worshippers&quot; with shaved heads or braided hair.

Balarama, as Baladewa, is an important character in the 11th-century Javanese text &quot;Kakawin Bhāratayuddha&quot;, the Kakawin poem based on the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

===Archeology, coins, arts, and epigraphy===

Balarama was anciently a powerful local deity named Samkarshana, associated with the local cult of the Vrishni heroes in Mathura from around the 4th century BCE. The concept of the avatars of Vishnu formed during the Kushan period in the 3rd to 2nd century CE.

Coins dated to about 185-170 BCE belonging to the Indo-Greek King Agathocles show Balarama&#x27;s iconography and Greek inscriptions. Balarama-Samkarshana is typically shown standing with a gada in his right hand and holding a plough in his left. On the other side of these coins is Vāsudeva-Krishna holding the conch and chakra.

At Chilas II archeological site dated to the first half of 1st-century CE in northwest Pakistan, near Afghanistan border, are engraved two males along with many Buddhist images nearby. The larger of the two males hold a plough and club in his two hands. The artwork also has an inscription with it in Kharosthi script, which has been deciphered by scholars as &quot;Rama-Krsna&quot;, and interpreted as an ancient depiction of the two brothers Balarama and Krishna. The early Balarama images found in Jansuti (Mathura, Uttar Pradesh) and two at Tumain (Ashoknagar, Madhya Pradesh) are dated to 2nd/1st-century BCE and these show Balarama holding a &quot;Hala&quot; (plough) and a &quot;musala&quot; (pestle) in his two hands.

In all of these early depictions, Balarama-Samkarsana seems to hold a senior position over Vāsudeva-Krishna. On the coins of Agathocles of Bactria, Balarama is on the front of the coin (the side with a legend in Greek), whereas Vāsudeva-Krishna is on the reverse (Brahmi side). At Chilas, Balarama is shown taller and bigger than Vāsudeva-Krishna. The same relationship is also visible in the hierarchy of the Vrishni heroes.

In some Indian ancient arts and texts, Balarama (Sankarsana) and Krishna (Vasudeva) are two of the five heroes (&quot;Pancaviras of the Vrishnis&quot;). The other three differ by the text. In some those are &quot;Pradyumna, Samba and Aniruddha&quot;, in others &quot;Anadhrsti, Sarana and Viduratha&quot;. The 1st-century Mora well inscription near Mathura, dated between 10 and 25 CE, mention the installation of five Vrishni heroes in a stone temple.
The earliest surviving southeast Asian artwork related to Balarama is from the Phnom Da collection, near Angkor Borei in Cambodia&#x27;s lower Mekong Delta region.

==Legend==

Balarama was the son of Vasudeva. The evil king Kamsa, the tyrant of Mathura, was intent upon killing the children of his cousin, Devaki, because of a prophecy that he would die at the hands of her eighth child. The Harivamsha states that Kamsa went on to murder the first six children of the imprisoned Devaki by smashing the newborns against a stone floor. When Balarama was conceived, Vishnu intervened, state the Hindu legends; his embryo was transferred from Devaki&#x27;s womb into the womb of Rohini, Vasudeva&#x27;s first wife. In some texts, this transfer gives Balarama the epithet &quot;Sankarshana&quot; (one who was dragged away). Balarama grew up with his younger brother Krishna with his foster-parents, in the household of the head of cowherds Nanda, and his wife, Yashoda. The chapter 10 of the Bhagavata Purana describes it as follows:

He was named Rama, but because of his great strength, he was called Balarama, Baladeva, or Balabhadra, meaning &quot;Strong Rama&quot;. He was born on Shraavana Purnima, which coincides with the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.

===Childhood and marriage===

One day, Nanda requested the presence of Sage Gargamuni, his priest, to name the newborn Krishna and Balarama. When the Garga arrived, Nanda received him well and requested the naming ceremony. Gargamuni then reminded Nanda that Kamsa was looking for the son of Devaki and if he performed the ceremony in opulence, it would come to his attention. Nanda, therefore, asked Garga to perform the ceremony in secret and Garga did so:


Balarama spent his childhood as a cow herder with his brother Krishna. He killed Dhenuka, an asura sent by Kamsa, as well as Pralamba and Mushtika wrestlers sent by the king. When Krishna was killing Kamsa, Balarama slew his mighty commander, Kalavakra. After the evil king was slain, Balarama and Krishna went to the ashrama of sage Sandipani at Ujjain for their education. Balarama married Revati, the daughter of King Kakudmi. He had two sons - Nishatha and Ulmuka, and a daughter - Shashirekha also known as Vatsala.

Balarama is the celebrated tiller, one of the embodiments of agriculture along with livestock with whom Krishna is associated with. The plough is Balarama&#x27;s weapon. In the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, he uses it to fight asuras, dig a way for Yamuna river to bring it closer to Vrindavan, and he also availed it to drag the entire capital of Hastinapura into the Ganga river.

===Kurukshetra War ===

Balarama taught both Duryodhana of the Kauravas and Bhima of the Pandavas the art of war with a mace. When war broke between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, Balarama carried obligations for both sides and so remained neutral. He went for a pilgrimage with his nephew Pradyumna and other Yadavas during the war, and returned on the last day, to watch the fight between his disciples. When Bhima defeated Duryodhana by striking him in the thigh with his mace, a traditional violation of the rules of combat, Balarama threatened to kill Bhima. This was prevented when Krishna reminded Balarama of Bhima&#x27;s vow—to kill Duryodhana by crushing the thigh he had exposed to Bhima&#x27;s wife, Draupadi.

===Disappearance===

In the Bhagavata Purana, it is described that after Balarama took part in the battle causing the destruction of the remainder of the Yadu dynasty and witnessing the disappearance of Krishna, he sat down in a meditative state and departed from this world.

Some scriptures describe a great white snake that left the mouth of Balarama, in reference to his identity as Ananta-Sesha, a form of Vishnu. The place where he departed is situated near Somnath Temple in Gujarat.

The local people of Veraval believe about the cave near the temple place, that the white snake who came out of Balarama&#x27;s mouth got into that cave and went back to Patala&quot;.&quot;

===Significance===

In Hindu tradition, Balarama is depicted as a farmer&#x27;s patron deity, signifying the one who is &quot;harbinger of knowledge&quot;, of agricultural tools and prosperity. He is almost always shown and described with Krishna, such as in the act of stealing butter, playing childhood pranks, complaining to Yashoda that his baby brother Krishna had eaten dirt, playing in cow sheds, studying together at the school of guru Sandipani, and fighting malevolent beasts sent by Kamsa to kill the two brothers. He is the constant companion of Krishna, ever watchful, leading to the epithet &quot;Luk Luk Dauji&quot; (or &quot;Luk Luk Daubaba&quot;) in the Pustimarga tradition of Vaishnavism. In the classical Tamil work Akananuru, Krishna hides from Balarama when he steals the clothes of the milkmaids while they bathe, suggesting his brother&#x27;s vigilance. He is a creative store of knowledge for the agriculturists: the knowledge that dug a water channel to bring Yamuna water to Vrindavan; that restored groves, farms and forests; that produced goods and drinks.

In Hindu texts, Balarama almost always supports Krishna in form and spirit. However, there are occasions where the dialogues between Balarama and Krishna present different viewpoints, with Krishna&#x27;s wisdom establishing him to be the ultimate divinity. Balarama&#x27;s constant symbolic association with Krishna makes him the protector and supporter of dharma.

==Iconography==

Balarama is depicted as light-skinned, in contrast to his brother, Krishna, who is dark-skinned; Krishna in Sanskrit means dark. His &quot;ayudha&quot; or weapons are the plough &quot;hala&quot; and the mace &quot;gadā&quot;. The plough is usually called Balachita. He often wears blue garments and a garland of forest flowers. His hair is tied in a topknot and he has earrings, bracelets and armlets; he is known for his strength, the reason for his name; Bala means strength in Sanskrit.

In the Jagannath tradition, one particularly popular in eastern and central regions of India, he is more often called Balabhadra. Balarama is one in the triad, wherein Balarama is shown together with his brother Jagannath (Krishna) and sister Subhadra (Subhadra). Jagannath is identifiable from his circular eyes compared to an oval of Shubhadra and almond-shaped eyes of the abstract icon for Balarama. Further, Balarama&#x27;s face is white, Jagannath&#x27;s icon is dark, and Subhadra icon is yellow. The third difference is the flat head of Jagannath icon, compared to the semi-circular carved head of abstract Balarama. The shape of Balabhadra&#x27;s head, also called Balarama or Baladeva in these regions, varies in some temples between somewhat flat and semi-circular.

===Jainism===

The Jain Puranas, notably, the &quot;Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacarita&quot; of Hemachandra, narrate hagiographical accounts of nine Baladevas or Balabhadras who are believed to be śalākāpuruṣas (literally torch-bearers, great personalities). Balarama was the ninth one. Balarama along with Krishna are considered as cousins of the revered Tirthankara Neminatha (Aristanemi) by Jains.

The Jainism tradition lists 63 &quot;Śalākāpuruṣa&quot; or notable figures which, amongst others, includes the twenty-four &quot;Tirthankaras&quot; and nine sets of triads. One of these triads is Krishna as the &quot;Vasudeva&quot;, Balarama as the &quot;Baladeva&quot;, and Jarasandha as the &quot;Prati-Vasudeva&quot;. In each age of the Jain cyclic time is born a &quot;Vasudeva&quot; with an elder brother termed the &quot;Baladeva&quot;. Between the triads, &quot;Baladeva&quot; upholds the principle of non-violence, a central idea of Jainism. The villain is the &quot;Prati-vasudeva&quot;, who attempts to destroy the world. To save the world, &quot;Vasudeva-Krishna&quot; has to forsake the non-violence principle and kill the &quot;Prati-Vasudeva&quot;. The stories of these triads can be found in the &quot;Harivamsa Purana&quot; (8thcentury CE) of Jinasena (not be confused with its namesake, the addendum to &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;) and the &quot;Trishashti-shalakapurusha-charita&quot; of Hemachandra.
The story of Krishna&#x27;s life in the &quot;Puranas&quot; of Jainism follows the same general outline as those in the Hindu texts, but in details, they are very different: they include Jain &quot;Tirthankaras&quot; as characters in the story, and generally are polemically critical of Krishna, unlike the versions found in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, and the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;. For example, Krishna loses battles in the Jain versions, and his &quot;gopis&quot; and his clan of Yadavas die in a fire created by an ascetic named Dvaipayana. Similarly, after dying from the hunter Jara&#x27;s arrow, the Jaina texts state Krishna goes to the third hell in Jain cosmology, while Balarama is said to go to the sixth heaven.

In other Jain texts, Krishna and Baladeva are stated to be a cousin of the twenty-second &quot;Tirthankara&quot;, Neminatha. The Jain texts state that Naminatha taught Krishna all the wisdom that he later gave to Arjuna in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. According to Jeffery D. Long, a professor of Religion known for his publications on Jainism, this connection between Krishna and Neminatha has been a historic reason for Jains to accept, read, and cite the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; as a spiritually important text, celebrate Krishna-related festivals, and intermingle with Hindus as spiritual cousins.

Evidence related to early Jainism, states Patrick Olivelle and other scholars, suggests Balarama had been a significant farmer deity in Jain tradition in parts of the Indian subcontinent such as near the Mathura region. Jain texts such as the &quot;Kalpasutra&quot; describe the same idea of embryo transfer, as in Hindu texts for Balarama, for the 24th Tirthankara Mahavira; in the latter case, the embryo of a Brahmin woman is moved into the womb of a Kshatriya woman. Balarama, states Pratapaditya Pal, was one of the historic deities revered in Jainism along with Ambika, Lakshmi and others. As with the Hindu farmers, state Paul Dundas and other scholars, it is likely that Balarama was the patron deity of Jain farmers in the early centuries of the common era, because a large number of Balarama images have been found in early Jain arts.

===Buddhism===
Balarama images have been discovered in central Indian Buddhist sites, such as with Sanchi stupas at Andher, Mehgaon and Chandna. These are dated to around the start of the common era. The Ghata Jataka, one of the Jataka Tales that form part of Buddhist scriptures, depicts Krishna as a previous birth of Buddha&#x27;s disciple Sariputta and has Balarama depicted as the previous birth of one of the Buddha&#x27;s disciples.

<text>Belaugh is a small village (population 105) increasing to 134 at the 2011 Census, that occupies a bend in the River Bure in Norfolk, England - within The Broads National Park. It is accessible via the road between Hoveton and Coltishall or from the river. It contains no pubs or shops. The main civic features are the church of St Peter, Belaugh and the Old School, which also belongs to the church and is used for parish council meetings and for celebrating the harvest festival. The local broad is Belaugh Broad. Most of the land around Belaugh - about - is owned by the Trafford family, who are Lords of the Manor.

== History of Belaugh ==
The Domesday Book of 1086 contains one of the earliest recorded mentions of the village, at the time known as Belaga. Other records from around the time name it as Belihagh, Belaw, Bilhagh or Bilough, names based on combinations of Norse, Danish and Anglo-Saxon words that collectively mean &#x27;a dwelling place by the water&#x27;.

== Belaugh St Peter ==
Belaugh St Peter is a Church of England church located at the top of a steep slope above the village. It was built circa 14th century and contains an ornate rood screen decorated with images of the apostles that appears to have been added in the early 16th century. In the 17th century a soldier loyal to Oliver Cromwell (described in a letter to Sheriff Tofts of Norwich as a &#x27;godly trooper&#x27;) scraped away the faces of the apostles, such images being regarded as idolatrous by many of Cromwell&#x27;s followers. According to records displayed in the church, the letter writer also added disapprovingly that, &quot;The Steeple house [of Belaugh St Peter] stands high, perked like one of the idolatrous high places of Israel&quot;. The font of the church is shaped in the Norman style as a cauldron made of a blue stone.

One unusual feature of the church is the remains of blank arcading on the outside of the south wall of the nave. If original this looks more Saxon than Norman.

The church organ was built between 1886 and 1904 by the Reverend George Buck, who was rector between 1880 and 1907 and son of Dr Zephaniah Buck, organist of Norwich Cathedral. George Buck also built church organs for Edingthorpe and Little Melton.

John Betjeman stated that it was the view of St Peter&#x27;s from the river that began his lifelong passion for churches.

== The Belaugh Ghost ==
According to information displayed in the church of St Peter Belaugh, in 1695 Richard Slater - a servant at the village&#x27;s rectory - stole money and jewels from the church and buried them in the rectory garden. When he later returned to dig up the stash, he was discovered by the rector. In the scuffle that followed, the thief drowned in the river. He is supposed to rise up nightly to recover the money, only to be forced down again by the weight of the stolen loot.

==Environmental incidents==
In 2023, raw sewage was pumped into the River Bure at Belaugh for around 2000 hours, or the equivalent of 84 consecutive days. This was caused by a storm overflow, designed to prevent blockages in sewer systems by releasing sewage into bodies of water during periods of heavy rainfall. The surge in sewage outflows at Belaugh nearly tripled compared to the preceding year, marking it as the most severely impacted locale in the region.

<doc id="99582" wikidata="Q31666" url="?curid=99582" title="Aditi">
<text>Aditi (Sanskrit: अदिति, lit. &#x27;boundless&#x27; or &#x27;limitless&#x27; or &#x27;innocence&#x27;) is an important Vedic goddess in Hinduism. 

She is the personification of the sprawling infinite and vast cosmos. She is the goddess of motherhood, consciousness, unconsciousness, the past, the future, and fertility. She is the mother of the celestial deities known as the adityas, and is referred to as the mother of many deities. As celestial mother of numerous beings, the synthesis of all things, she is associated with space (&quot;akasha&quot;) and with mystic speech (&quot;Vāc&quot;). She may be seen as a feminine form of Brahma, and associated with the primal substance (&quot;mulaprakriti&quot;) in the Vedanta. She is mentioned more than 250 times in the &quot;Rigveda,&quot; the verses replete with her praise.

== Family ==
Aditi is the daughter of Daksha and Asikni (Panchajani). The &quot;Puranas&quot;, such as the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, suggest that Daksha married all of his daughters off to different people, including Aditi and 12 others to Sage Kashyapa. When Kashyapa was living with Aditi and Diti in his ashrama, he was really pleased with Aditi&#x27;s services, and told her to ask for a boon. Aditi prayed for one ideal son. Accordingly, Indra was born. Later, Aditi gave birth to the twelve adityas, namely Varuna, Parjanya, Mitra, Amsha, Pushan, Dhatri, Aryaman, Surya, Bhaga, Savitr, Vamana, and Viṣṇu. Her 16 younger sisters were also married to Sage Kashyapa.

== Origin ==
The first mention of Aditi is found in &quot;Rigveda&quot;, which is dated by mainstream consensus to have been composed between 1800 and 1200 BC. She is portrayed as the mother of the Adityas, a group of societal Rigvedic deities, including Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, Daksha, Bhaga, Amsha, and sometimes Surya and Savitar. As the mother of the societal deities, she represented the compliance to social behavior. Her motherhood was also an important attribute, and later was expanded so that she became the mother of all deities.

According to the Shatapatha Brahmana (a commentary on the Shukla Yajurveda), Aditi is also invoked during ritual sacrificial offerings as being synonymous with the Earth:

== Attributes ==
===Motherhood===

Aditi and the sage Kashyapa had 33 sons, out of whom twelve are called Ādityas including Surya, eleven are called Rudras, and eight are called Vasus.
Aditi is said to be the mother of the great god Indra, the mother of kings (Mandala 2.27) and the mother of gods (Mandala 1.113.19). In the &quot;Vedas&quot;, Aditi is Devamata (mother of the celestial gods) as from and in her cosmic matrix all the heavenly bodies were born. She is preeminently the mother of 12 Âdityas, whose names include , , , , Savitar, Bhaga, , , Mitra, and .

She is also the mother of the Vamana, &quot;avatar&quot; of Vishnu. Accordingly, the Vamana &quot;avatar&quot;, as the son of Aditi was born in the month of Shravana (fourth month of the Hindu Calendar, also called Avani) under the star Shravana. Many auspicious signs appeared in the heavens, foretelling the good fortune of this child.

In the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, Aditi is one of the most important figures of all. As a mothering presence, Aditi is often asked to guard the one who petitions her (Mandala 1.106.7; Mandala 8.18.6) or to provide him or her with wealth, safety, and abundance (Mandala 10.100; 1.94.15).

===Creativity===
Aditi is usually mentioned in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; along with other gods and goddesses. There is no one hymn addressed exclusively to her, unlike other Vedic gods. Since She is perhaps not related to a particular natural phenomenon like other gods. Compared to Ushas and Prithvi, Aditi can be defined as the cosmic creator.

The verse &quot;Daksha sprang from Aditi and Aditi from Daksha&quot; is seen by Theosophists as a reference to &quot;the eternal cyclic re-birth of the same divine Essence&quot; and divine wisdom.

===Freedom===
The name Aditi includes the root &quot;da&quot; (to bind or fetter) and suggests another attribute of her character. As A-diti, she is an unbound, free soul and it is evident in the hymns to her that she is often called to free the petitioner from different hindrances, especially sin and sickness. (Mandala 2.27.14). In one hymn, she is asked to free a petitioner who has been tied up like a thief (Mandala 8.67.14). As one who unbinds, her role is similar to her son Varuna&#x27;s as guardian of Rta, cosmic moral order. She is called the supporter of creatures (Mandala 1.136).

===Might===
Aditi was attributed the status of &quot;first deity&quot; by the Vedic culture, although she is not the only one attributed this status in the &quot;Vedas&quot;. She is addressed in the Rigveda as &quot;mighty&quot; and revered as the eternal mother of all creation.

===Others===
Like many other Hindu gods and goddesses, Aditi has a &quot;vahana&quot; (a mount). Aditi flies across the boundless sky on a phoenix. The phoenix symbolizes strength, honour, but most importantly, reflects Aditi&#x27;s nature of cyclical rebirth and infinite creation. 

Her weapons include the famous &quot;trishula,&quot; and a sword. 

Aditi is described to possess a pair of earrings, which are stolen from her by the asura named Naraka. Krishna returns the earrings to her after slaying the asura with his consort, Satyabhama. 

== Worship ==
A well known old temple of Aditi is located near rock cut cave in Vizhinjam, Kerala.

<text>Woodbastwick ( ) is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It is located on the River Bure between Cockshoot Broad and Salhouse Broad, within The Broads and close to Bure Marshes NNR (national nature reserve). The city of Norwich lies to the south-west. The civil parish also includes the villages of Ranworth and Panxworth.

The village name relates to bast, a pliable substance found under the bark of the lime tree. Danish and Saxon invaders used bast as a form of binding to tie leggings and other items. As a consequence, Woodbastwick&#x27;s village sign shows two invaders tying their leggings.

The village contains thatched houses set around a village green, and the church of St Fabian &amp; St Sebastian, also thatched. The Woodforde Broadland Brewery is located in the village and produces cask ales such as &quot;Wherry Bitter&quot;, &quot;Nelson&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;Norfolk Nog&quot; and &quot;Headcracker&quot;.

The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 362 in 157 households, increasing to a population of 399 in 168 households at the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of Broadland. Woodbastwick Hall is the seat of the Cator family.

<text>Hindu deities are the gods and goddesses in Hinduism. Deities in Hinduism are as diverse as its traditions, and a Hindu can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, even agnostic, atheistic, or humanist. The terms and epithets for deities within the diverse traditions of Hinduism vary, and include Deva, Devi, Ishvara, Ishvari, Bhagavān and Bhagavati.

The deities of Hinduism have evolved from the Vedic era (2nd millennium BCE) through the medieval era (1st millennium CE), regionally within Nepal, Pakistan, India and in Southeast Asia, and across Hinduism&#x27;s diverse traditions. The Hindu deity concept varies from a personal god as in Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, to thirty-three major deities in the Vedas, to hundreds of deities mentioned in the Puranas of Hinduism. Illustrations of major deities include Vishnu, Lakshmi, Shiva, Parvati, Brahma and Saraswati. These deities have distinct and complex personalities, yet are often viewed as aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called Brahman. From ancient times, the idea of equivalence has been cherished for all Hindus, in its texts and in early 1st-millennium sculpture with concepts such as Harihara (Half Vishnu, Half Shiva) and Ardhanārīshvara (half Shiva, half Parvati), with myths and temples that feature them together, declaring they are the same. Major deities have inspired their own Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism, but with shared mythology, ritual grammar, theosophy, axiology and polycentrism. Some Hindu traditions, such as Smartism from the mid 1st millennium CE, have included multiple major deities as henotheistic manifestations of Saguna Brahman, and as a means to realizing Nirguna Brahman. In Samkhya philosophy, Devata or &quot;deities&quot; are considered as &quot;natural sources of energy&quot; who have Sattva as the dominant Guna.

Hindu deities are represented with various icons and anicons in sculptures and paintings, called Murtis and &quot;Pratimas&quot;. Some Hindu traditions, such as ancient Charvakas, rejected all deities and concept of god or goddess, while 19th-century British colonial era movements such as the Arya Samaj and Brahmo Samaj rejected deities and adopted monotheistic concepts similar to Abrahamic religions. Hindu deities have been adopted in other religions such as Jainism, and in regions outside India, such as predominantly Buddhist Thailand and Japan, where they continue to be revered in regional temples or arts.

In ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism, the human body is described as a temple, and deities are described to be parts residing within it, while the Brahman (Absolute Reality, God) is described to be the same, or of similar nature, as the Atman (Self), which Hindus believe is eternal and within every living being.

==Devas and devis==
Deities in Hinduism are referred to as Deva (masculine) and Devi (feminine). The root of these terms means &quot;heavenly, divine, anything of excellence&quot;.

In the earliest Vedic literature, all supernatural beings are called Asuras. By the late Vedic period (c. 500 BCE), benevolent supernatural beings are referred to as &quot;Deva-Asuras&quot;. In post-Vedic texts, such as the Puranas and the Itihasas of Hinduism, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad. In some medieval Indian literature, &quot;Devas&quot; are also referred to as Suras and contrasted with their equally powerful, but malevolent counterparts referred to as the Asuras.

Hindu deities are part of Hindu mythology, both Devas and Devis feature in one of many cosmological theories in Hinduism.

===Characteristics of Vedic-era deities===
In Vedic literature, Devas and Devis represent the forces of nature and some represent moral values (such as the Adityas, Varuna, and Mitra), each symbolizing the epitome of specialized knowledge, creative energy, exalted and magical powers (&quot;Siddhis&quot;).

The most referred to Devas in the Rigveda are Indra, Agni (fire) and Soma, with &quot;fire deity&quot; called the friend of all humanity. Indra and Soma are two celebrated in a yajna fire ritual that marks major Hindu ceremonies. Savitr, Vishnu, Rudra (later given the exclusive epithet of Shiva), and Prajapati (later Brahma) are gods and hence Devas.

The Vedas describes a number of significant Devis such as Ushas (dawn), Prithvi (earth), Aditi (cosmic moral order), Saraswati (river, knowledge), Vāc (sound), Nirṛti (destruction), Ratri (night), Aranyani (forest), and bounty goddesses such as Dinsana, Raka, Puramdhi, Parendi, Bharati, Mahi, among others, mentioned in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. Sri, also called Lakshmi, appears in late Vedic texts dated to be pre-Buddhist, but verses dedicated to her do not suggest that her characteristics were fully developed in the Vedic era. All gods and goddesses are distinguished in the Vedic times, but in the post-Vedic texts (c. 500 BCE to 200 CE), and particularly in the early medieval era literature, they are ultimately seen as aspects or manifestations of one Brahman, the Supreme power.

Ananda Coomaraswamy states that Devas and Asuras in the Vedic lore are similar to Angels-Theoi-Gods and Titans of Greek mythology, both are powerful but have different orientations and inclinations, the Devas representing the powers of Light and the Asuras representing the powers of Darkness in Hindu mythology. According to Coomaraswamy&#x27;s interpretation of Devas and Asuras, both these natures exist in each human being, the tyrant and the angel is within each being, the best and the worst within each person struggles before choices and one&#x27;s nature, and the Hindu formulation of Devas and Asuras is an eternal dance between these within each person.

===Characteristics of medieval-era deities===
In the Puranas and the Itihasas with the embedded Bhagavad Gita, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad. According to the Bhagavad Gita (16.6–16.7), all beings in the universe have both the divine qualities (&quot;daivi sampad&quot;) and the demonic qualities (&quot;asuri sampad&quot;) within them. The sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita states that pure god-like saints are rare, as are pure demon-like evil individuals among human beings. Instead, the majority of humanity is multi-charactered with a few or many faults. According to Jeaneane Fowler, the Gita states that desires, aversions, greed, needs, emotions in various forms &quot;are facets of ordinary lives&quot;. It is only when they turn to lust, hate, cravings, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, hypocrisy, violence, cruelty and such negativity- and destruction-inclined tendencies that natural human inclinations metamorphose into something demonic (Asura).
The Epics and medieval era texts, particularly the Puranas, developed extensive and richly varying mythologies associated with Hindu deities, including their genealogies. Several of the Purana texts are named after major Hindu deities such as Vishnu, Shiva and Devi. Other texts and commentators such as Adi Shankara explain that Hindu deities live or rule over the cosmic body as well as in the temple of the human body. They remark that the Sun deity is the eyes, the Vāyu the nose, the Prajapati the sexual organs, the Lokapalas the ears, Chandra the mind, Mitra the inward breath, Varuna the outward breath, Indra the arms, Bṛhaspati the speech, Vishnu, whose stride is great, is the feet, and Māyā is the smile.

===Symbolism===
Edelmann states that gods and anti-gods of Hinduism are symbolism for spiritual concepts. For example, god Indra (a Deva) and the antigod Virocana (an Asura) question a sage for insights into the knowledge of the self. Virocana leaves with the first given answer, believing now he can use the knowledge as a weapon. In contrast, Indra keeps pressing the sage, churning the ideas, and learning about means to inner happiness and power. Edelmann suggests that the Deva-Asura dichotomies in Hindu mythology may be seen as &quot;narrative depictions of tendencies within our selves&quot;. Hindu deities in Vedic era, states Mahoney, are those artists with &quot;powerfully inward transformative, effective and creative mental powers&quot;.

In Hindu mythology, everyone starts as an Asura, born of the same father. &quot;Asuras who remain Asura&quot; share the character of powerful beings craving for more power, more wealth, ego, anger, unprincipled nature, force and violence. The &quot;Asuras who become Devas&quot; in contrast are driven by an inner voice, seek understanding and meaning, prefer moderation, principled behavior, aligned with &quot;Ṛta&quot; and &quot;Dharma&quot;, knowledge and harmony.

The god (Deva) and antigod (Asura), states Edelmann, are also symbolically the contradictory forces that motivate each individual and people, and thus Deva-Asura dichotomy is a spiritual concept rather than mere genealogical category or species of being. In the Bhāgavata Purana, saints and gods are born in families of Asuras, such as Mahabali and Prahlada, conveying the symbolism that motivations, beliefs and actions rather than one&#x27;s birth and family circumstances define whether one is Deva-like or Asura-like.

==Ishvara==
Another Hindu term that is sometimes translated as the deity is Ishvara, or various deities are described, state Sorajjakool et al., as &quot;the personifications of various aspects of the same Ishvara&quot;. The term &quot;Ishvara&quot; has a wide range of meanings that depend on the era and the school of Hinduism. In ancient texts of Indian philosophy, &quot;Ishvara&quot; means supreme Self, Brahman (Highest Reality), ruler, king or husband depending on the context. In medieval era texts, &quot;Ishvara&quot; means God, Supreme Being, personal god, or special Self depending on the school of Hinduism.

Among the six systems of Hindu philosophy, Samkhya and Mimamsa do not consider the concept of &quot;Ishvara&quot;, i.e., a supreme being, relevant. Yoga, Vaisheshika, Vedanta, and Nyaya schools of Hinduism discuss Ishvara but assign different meanings.

Early Nyaya school scholars considered the hypothesis of a deity as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons, and fruits; but these early Nyaya scholars then rejected this hypothesis, and were non-theistic or atheists. Later scholars of Nyaya school reconsidered this question and offered counter arguments for what is Ishvara and various arguments to prove the existence of an omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent deity (God).

Vaisheshika school of Hinduism, as founded by Kanada in the 1st millennium BCE, neither required nor relied on a creator deity. Later Vaisheshika school adopted the concept of &quot;Ishvara&quot;, states Klaus Klostermaier, but as an eternal God who co-exists in the universe with eternal substances and atoms, but He &quot;winds up the clock, and lets it run its course&quot;.

Ancient Mimamsa scholars of Hinduism questioned what is &quot;Ishvara&quot; (deity, God)? They considered a deity concept unnecessary for a consistent philosophy and moksha (soteriology).

In the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, &quot;Isvara&quot; is neither a creator-God nor a savior-God. This is called one of the several major atheistic schools of Hinduism by some scholars. Others, such as Jacobsen, state that Samkhya is more accurately described as non-theistic. Deity is considered an irrelevant concept, neither defined nor denied, in Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy.

In the Yoga school of Hinduism, it is any &quot;personal deity&quot; (Ishta Deva or Ishta Devata) or &quot;spiritual inspiration&quot;, but not a creator God. Whicher explains that while Patanjali&#x27;s terse verses in the Yogasutras can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali&#x27;s concept of &quot;Isvara&quot; in Yoga philosophy functions as a &quot;transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation&quot;.

The Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism asserted that there is no dualistic existence of a deity (or deities). There is no otherness nor distinction between &quot;Jiva&quot; and &quot;Ishvara&quot;. God (Ishvara, Brahman) is identical with the Atman (Self) within each human being in Advaita Vedanta school, and there is a monistic Universal Absolute Oneness that connects everyone and everything.

In Dvaita sub-school of Vedanta Hinduism, &quot;Ishvara&quot; is defined as a creator God that is distinct from &quot;Jiva&quot; (individual Selfs in living beings). In this school, God creates individual Self (Atman), but the individual Self never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.

==Number of deities==

Yāska, the earliest known language scholar of India (c. 500 BCE), notes Wilkins, mentions that there are three deities (&quot;Devas&quot;) according to the Vedas, &quot;&quot;Agni&quot; (fire), whose place is on the earth; &quot;Vayu&quot; (wind), whose place is the air; and &quot;Surya&quot; (sun), whose place is in the sky&quot;. This principle of three worlds (or zones), and its multiples is found thereafter in many ancient texts. The Samhitas, which are the oldest layer of text in Vedas enumerate 33 devas, either 11 each for the three worlds, or as 12 Adityas, 11 Rudras, 8 Vasus and 2 Ashvins in the Brahmanas layer of Vedic texts.

The Rigveda states in hymn 1.139.11,

===One or one-ness===
Thirty-three &quot;koti&quot; (33 supreme) divinities are mentioned in other ancient texts, such as the Yajurveda. Most by far, are goddesses state Foulston and Abbott, suggesting &quot;how important and popular goddesses are&quot; in Hindu culture. Scholars state all deities are typically viewed in Hinduism as &quot;emanations or manifestation of genderless principle called Brahman, representing the many facets of Ultimate Reality&quot;. In Hinduism, the concept is that &quot;God, the universe, human beings and all else is essentially one thing&quot; and there is a connected oneness where the same God resides within every human being as Atman, the eternal Self.

==Iconography and practices==

Hinduism has an ancient and extensive iconography tradition, particularly in the form of &quot;Murti&quot; (Sanskrit: मूर्ति, IAST: Mūrti), or &quot;Vigraha&quot; or &quot;Pratima&quot;. A &quot;Murti&quot; is itself not the god in Hinduism, but it is an image of god and represents emotional and religious value. A literal translation of &quot;Murti&quot; as an idol is incorrect, states Jeaneane Fowler when the idol is understood as superstitious end in itself. Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a &quot;Murti&quot; is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases, the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer. When a person worships a &quot;Murti&quot;, it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper&#x27;s spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality or Brahman is not confined in it.

A Murti of a Hindu deity is typically made by carving stone, woodworking, metal casting, or through pottery. Medieval era texts describing their proper proportions, positions and gestures include the Puranas, Agamas and Samhitas particularly the Shilpa Shastras. The expressions in a &quot;Murti&quot; vary in diverse Hindu traditions, ranging from &quot;Ugra&quot; symbolism to express destruction, fear and violence (Durga, Parvati, Kali), as well as &quot;Saumya&quot; symbolism to express joy, knowledge, and harmony (Parvati, Saraswati, Lakshmi). Saumya images are most common in Hindu temples. Other Murti forms found in Hinduism include the Linga.

A &quot;Murti&quot; is an embodiment of the divine, the Ultimate Reality or Brahman to some Hindus. In the religious context, they are found in Hindu temples or homes, where they may be treated as a beloved guest and serve as a participant of Puja rituals in Hinduism. A murti is installed by priests, in Hindu temples, through the Prana Pratishtha ceremony, whereby state Harold Coward and David Goa, the &quot;divine vital energy of the cosmos is infused into the sculpture&quot; and then the divine is welcomed as one would welcome a friend. In other occasions, it serves as the center of attention in annual festive processions and these are called &quot;Utsava Murti&quot;.

===Temple and worship===

In Hinduism, deities and their icons may be hosted in a Hindu temple, within a home, or as an amulet. The worship performed by Hindus is known by several regional names, such as &quot;Puja&quot;. This practice in front of a murti may be elaborate in large temples, or be a simple song or mantra muttered in home, or offering made to sunrise or river or symbolic an icon of a deity. Archaeological evidence of deity worship in Hindu temples trace &quot;Puja&quot; rituals to Gupta Empire era (c. 4th century CE). In Hindu temples, various pujas may be performed daily at various times of the day; in other temples, it may be occasional.

The &quot;Puja&quot; practice is structured as an act of welcoming, hosting, and honoring the deity of one&#x27;s choice as one&#x27;s honored guest, and remembering the spiritual and emotional significance the deity represents to the devotee. Jan Gonda, as well as Diana L. Eck, states that a typical &quot;Puja&quot; involves one or more of 16 steps (&quot;Shodasha Upachara&quot;) traceable to ancient times: the deity is invited as a guest, the devotee hosts and takes care of the deity as an honored guest, praise (hymns) with Dhupa or Aarti along with food (Naivedhya) is offered to the deity, after an expression of love and respect the host takes leave, and with affection expresses goodbye to the deity. The worship practice may also involve reflecting on spiritual questions, with image serving as support for such meditation.

Deity worship (&quot;Bhakti&quot;), visiting temples, and &quot;Puja&quot; rites are not mandatory and are optional in Hinduism; it is the choice of a Hindu, it may be a routine daily affair for some Hindus, periodic ritual or infrequent for some. Worship practices in Hinduism are as diverse as its traditions, and a Hindu can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic, or humanist.

Devotees engage with deities in more personalized relationships. Ramanuja differentiates between three types of devotees: power-seekers, liberation-seekers, and those seeking love and communion with the deity. While all three are considered dharmic, they are not equally significant in terms of liberation. Power-seekers pursue goals for overall benefit, while liberation-seekers seek unity with the divine. The highest form of devotion is characterized by selfless love for the divine.

==Examples==
Major deities have inspired a vast genre of literature such as the Puranas and Agama texts as well their own Hindu traditions, but with shared mythology, ritual grammar, theosophy, axiology and polycentrism. Vishnu and his avatars are at the foundation of Vaishnavism, Shiva for Shaivism, Devi for Shaktism, and some Hindu traditions such as Smarta traditions who revere multiple major deities (five) as henotheistic manifestations of Brahman (absolute metaphysical Reality).

While there are diverse deities in Hinduism, states Lawrence, &quot;Exclusivism – which maintains that only one&#x27;s own deity is real&quot; is rare in Hinduism. Julius Lipner, and other scholars, state that pluralism and &quot;polycentrism&quot; – where other deities are recognized and revered by members of different &quot;denominations&quot;, has been the Hindu ethos and way of life.

===Trimurti and Tridevi===
The concept of Triad (or &quot;Trimurti&quot;, &quot;Trinity&quot;) makes a relatively late appearance in Hindu literature, or in the second half of 1st millennium BCE. The idea of triad, playing three roles in the cosmic affairs, is typically associated with Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva (also called &quot;Mahesh&quot;); however, this is not the only triad in Hindu literature. Other triads include &quot;Tridevi&quot;, of three goddesses – Lakshmi, Saraswati and Parvati in the text Devi Mahatmya, in the Shakta tradition, which further assert that Devi is the Brahman (Ultimate Reality) and it is her energy that empowers Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The other triads, formulated as deities in ancient Indian literature, include Sun (creator), Air (sustainer) and Fire (destroyer); Prana (creator), Food (sustainer) and Time (destroyer). These triads, states Jan Gonda, are in some mythologies grouped together without forming a Trinity, and in other times represented as equal, a unity and manifestations of one Brahman. In the Puranas, for example, this idea of threefold &quot;hypostatization&quot; is expressed as follows,

The triad appears in Maitrayaniya Upanishad, for the first time in recognized roles known ever since, where they are deployed to present the concept of three Guṇa – the innate nature, tendencies and inner forces found within every being and everything, whose balance transform and keeps changing the individual and the world. It is in the medieval Puranic texts, &quot;Trimurti&quot; concepts appears in various context, from rituals to spiritual concepts. The Bhagavad Gita, in verses 9.18, 10.21-23 and 11.15, asserts that the triad or trinity is manifestation of one Brahman, which Krishna affirms himself to be. However, suggests Bailey, the mythology of triad is &quot;not the influence nor the most important one&quot; in Hindu traditions, rather the ideologies and spiritual concepts develop on their own foundations. The triad, with Brahma creating, Vishnu preserving and Shiva destroying, balances the functioning of the whole universe.

===Avatars of Hindu deities===
Hindu mythology has nurtured the concept of the avatar (&quot;avatāra&quot;), which represents the descent of a deity on earth. This concept is commonly translated as &quot;incarnation&quot;, and is an &quot;appearance&quot; or &quot;manifestation&quot;.

The concept of the avatar is most developed in Vaishnavism tradition, and associated with Vishnu, particularly with Rama and Krishna. Vishnu takes numerous avatars in Hindu mythology. He becomes female, during the Samudra Manthana, in the form of Mohini, to resolve a conflict between the devas and the asuras. His male avatars include Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Buddha, and Kalki. In some lists, Balarama replaces the Buddha. Various texts, particularly the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, discuss the idea of an avatar of Vishnu appearing to restore the cosmic balance whenever the power of evil becomes excessive and causes persistent oppression in the world.

In Shaktism traditions, the concept appears in its legends as the various manifestations of Devi, the divine-mother principle in Hinduism. The avatars of Devi or Parvati include Durga and Kali, who are particularly revered in the eastern states of India, as well as Tantra traditions. Twenty-one avatars of Shiva are also described in Shaivism texts, but unlike Vaishnava traditions, Shaiva traditions focus directly on Shiva rather than the avatar concept.

<text>South Walsham is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It covers an area of and had a population of 738 in 303 households at the 2001 census. increasing to 845 living in 345 households at the 2011 Census.
For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of Broadland. Historically, the village comprised two separate parishes, that of St Mary and of St Lawrence. After fire damage in 1827, the church of St Lawrence slowly fell into disuse and the two parishes were combined in 1889.

The village has a primary school, a pub and the disused St Lawrence&#x27;s church, the tower of which collapsed in 1971, has been repurposed as the St Lawrence Centre for Training and the Arts, hosting various music concerts, art exhibitions, craft fairs and charity events. The parish is also home to the South Walsham estate, purchased in 1946 by Major Henry Broughton, 2nd Lord Fairhaven, which remains in the ownership of the family. Large parts of the estate are opened to the public as the Fairhaven Woodland and Water Garden. Throughout its history, South Walsham has been linked with the wealthy St Benet&#x27;s Abbey located just outside the parish.

The parish of South Walsham includes the hamlets of Town Green and Pilson Green, and South Walsham Broad lies adjacent to the village.

== History ==
The villages name means &#x27;W(e)alh&#x27;s homestead/village&#x27; or &#x27;Britons&#x27; homestead/village&#x27;.

South Walsham is recorded in the Codex Diplomaticus Aevi Saxonici as Súðwalshám in a document produced during the reign of Edward the Confessor. Early documents suggest that land in the present parish was owned by a freeman named under Guert, the brother of Harold Godwinson at the time of the Norman conquest of England, before passing under the stewardship of Godric the Steward. Its entry in the Domesday Book shows land ownership divided between William the Conqueror, William, Bishop of Thetford, Godric the Steward and St Benet&#x27;s Abbey - in total, there were around 124 villagers excluding women and children. During the Middle Ages, much of the land in the parish was used to produce peat for fuel, and records of turbary show that around two hundred thousand turves were sold per annum, yielding an average income of around seven pounds per annum. These revenues dropped rapidly, from over eight pounds (and 250 000 units) in 1268–69 to around two pounds (and 56 700 units) in 1290–91, as the former peat cuttings began to flood and The Broads were formed. There are references to flooded land (or &quot;Broddinge&quot;) as early as 1315.

After the English Reformation, the abbey at St Benet&#x27;s remained in use for some time, but had fallen into decay by the early stages of the reign of Elizabeth I.

In the twentieth century, war memorials list 14 deaths from within the parish during World War I. The tower of St Lawrence&#x27;s church, damaged by a fire on the 30 May 1827, collapsed on the 18 March 1971, with little damage to the church itself.

<text>Martham is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It is situated some north-west of the town of Great Yarmouth and north-east of the city of Norwich.

The villages name means &#x27;marten homestead/village&#x27; or &#x27;weasel/marten hemmed-in land&#x27;.

The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 3,126 in 1,267 households, the population including Cess and increasing at the 2011 Census to 3,569. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of Great Yarmouth. In recent years the population has expanded with considerable housing being constructed. Bus service to Great Yarmouth is regular. There was a station in the village adjacent to a level crossing on Rollesby Road Martham railway station, but this closed in 1959, when the entire line from Great Yarmouth to North Walsham was eliminated. The station buildings stood for another 30 years.

Education is available in the village from Early Years to aged 16. Martham Primary &amp; Nursery caters for children up to Year 6, with Flegg High School taking students from Year 7 to Year 11. Post 16 education is available at other establishments outside of Martham.

The village has several Georgian houses, a large village green, covering three areas of greensward and two duck ponds. Near St Mary&#x27;s church Church of England, Ferrygate Lane leads to Martham Ferry, where an unusual floating swing bridge crosses the River Thurne. The bridge leads to Heigham Holmes, an island nature reserve, which can only be accessed by the public on special occasions. About to the north of the village is Martham Broad, a nature reserve, which is not navigable by boat.

The Saxons settled in Martham around AD601 and gave the village its name, &quot;the ham of the martens&quot;, the home of the polecats.

The Anglican missionary Anna Hinderer died in the village in 1870.

<doc id="99589" wikidata="Q2224508" url="?curid=99589" title="Thurne">
<text>Thurne is a small village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It is located on the River Thurne in The Broads, some west of the town of Great Yarmouth and east of the city of Norwich.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Thorn-bush&#x27;.

The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 116 in 54 households and at the 2011 Census, including Ashby with Oby, had a population of 212 in 94 households. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of Great Yarmouth.

The village lies at the end of Thurne Dyke, a popular mooring, not least because of Thurne windpump, which became known locally as Morse&#x27;s Mill, Bob Morse, who purchased it to prevent it from being sold for scrap. It is a popular object for photography, after being painted white. There is a second windpump across the river, the St Benet&#x27;s Level windpump.

Thurne is also home to the well-respected sailing club Theta, which has been accommodated here for over half a century and is now part of the village&#x27;s character. Free moorings are available for three boats at Thurne mouth. From there, it is a short walk to the village, with a large pub, the &quot;Lion Inn&quot;, and a small shop.

The Weavers&#x27; Way, a long-distance footpath, runs through the village.

Thurne in 1954 is featured in film held by the Cinema Museum in London. Ref HM0568.

<doc id="99590" wikidata="Q2511316" url="?curid=99590" title="Potter Heigham">
<text>Potter Heigham is a village and civil parish on the River Thurne in the English county of Norfolk. It is situated north-east of the city of Norwich on the A149 road, and within the Broads National Park.

The village is known for its medieval bridge and the Church of St Nicholas. There are two national nature reserves within the parish; the Ludham - Potter Heigham NNR is to the west of the village whilst the Heigham Holmes NNR is to the east. The Weavers Way, a long distance footpath, also passes through the village on its way from Cromer to Great Yarmouth.

== History ==
The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Hatch homestead/village&#x27; or perhaps, &#x27;hedge homestead/village&#x27;. There is evidence for Romano-British pottery industry here hence the &#x27;Potter&#x27; addition.

The parish of Potter Heigham (pronounced locally as Ham) has a number of features related to the World Wars. Hickling Broad, to the north of the parish, was used as a seaplane base during World War I. Part of Ludham Airstrip, a now shrunken remnant of a larger World War II airbase, is also built on parish lands, and there were a number of defensive structures around the medieval bridge.

The Museum of The Broads was opened in Potter Heigham in 1996, and moved to its current location at the Poor&#x27;s Staithe in Stalham in 1999.

== Government ==
The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 961 in 425 households, the population increasing to 1,043 at the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of North Norfolk and the county of Norfolk.

As in other broadland villages, the areas adjacent to the river fall under the administration of the Broads Authority.

== Main sights ==

Apart from the church of St Nicholas and the medieval bridge, Potter Heigham has a number of buildings of historic or architectural note. These include the Heigham Holmes windpump to the east of the parish, High&#x27;s mill on the River Thurne, and Sunways corn mill, all of which are listed buildings. The village is home to Lathams of Potter Heigham, a department store opened in 1964, but now owned by the QD Stores group.

=== Church of St Nicholas ===

Potter Heigham church is dedicated to St Nicholas, the patron saint of fishermen and children. The earliest surviving feature is the round tower, which dates from the 12th century and has a 14th-century octagonal extension, one of the best preserved in the country.

It is famed for its hammerbeam roof and the almost unique 15th-century brick font. The church also contains a scheme of wall paintings dating from the 14th century, the most readable of which depicts the Seven Works of Mercy. When the roof was re-thatched it required about 1850 bundles of reed. It is one of 124 existing round-tower churches in Norfolk. The church is a Grade I listed building.

=== Potter Heigham Bridge ===
Potter Heigham Bridge is a medieval bridge, believed to date from 1385, famous for being the most difficult to navigate in the Broads. The bridge opening is so narrow that only small cruisers can pass through it, and then only at low water, usually with the help of resident pilots at Phoenix Fleet boatyard next to the Bridge - there is a fee of £20 - £10 each way for holiday craft in the summer. Hire boats from the main agencies pay 50%, i.e. £10 for both trips. A modern roadbridge is close by.

==Folklore==
A tale is told that in 1742 Lady Carew and her daughter Evelyn were taken away on Evelyn&#x27;s wedding day by a phantom coach driven by skeletons. The coach reportedly caught alight as it crossed Potter Heigham bridge. It is also said that the ghost of a drummer boy skates across the Broad during the month of February.

== Notable people ==
*The Norfolk humorist Sidney Grapes lived and worked in Potter Heigham. He was famous for his collection of Norfolk dialect letters entitled &quot;The Boy John Letters&quot;, which were originally published in the Eastern Daily Press.
*Arthur Ransome set his books &quot;Coot Club&quot; and &quot;The Big Six&quot; in the Norfolk Broads, and Potter Heigham features as a location in both.

<doc id="99591" wikidata="Q910923" url="?curid=99591" title="Communards' Wall">
<text>The Communards’ Wall () at the Père Lachaise cemetery is where 147 Commune soldiers along with another 19 officers were executed on May 28, 1871, during the Semaine sanglante, the suppression of the Paris Commune. The soldiers were buried in a common grave at the foot of the wall.

The Père Lachaise cemetery was established in May 1804 on a land owned by the Jesuits for centuries, and where Père (&quot;Father&quot;) Lachaise, confessor of Louis XIV, lived the latter part of his life. The cemetery of the aristocracy in the 19th century, it also received the remains of famous people from previous eras. During the spring of 1871 the last of the combatants of the Commune entrenched themselves in the cemetery. The French Army, which was summoned to suppress the Commune, won control towards the end of the afternoon of May 28, captured the remaining Commune soldiers. As with other prisoners taken during the Commune, those captured with weapons in hand, numbering 147, were lined up and executed. Those executed at the wall also included a group of Commune officers, who had been captured earlier at other locations, imprisoned in two army barracks nearby, tried by military tribunals, sentenced to death, and delivered to the cemetery for execution and burial. This brought the total number to an estimated but unconfirmed 166. They were all buried in the same common grave.

The number executed and buried at the wall there is not known exactly, but is estimated at 166 by historian Michele Audin. Other casualties were brought to the cemetery later from other parts of the city and buried in the cemetery. The wall is now the site of an annual commemoration of the Commune and its casualties.

<doc id="99597" wikidata="Q185317" url="?curid=99597" title="Cecum">
<text>The cecum or caecum is a pouch within the peritoneum that is considered to be the beginning of the large intestine. It is typically located on the right side of the body (the same side of the body as the appendix, to which it is joined). The word cecum (, plural ceca ) stems from the Latin &quot;&quot; meaning blind.

It receives chyme from the ileum, and connects to the ascending colon of the large intestine. It is separated from the ileum by the ileocecal valve (ICV), also called Bauhin&#x27;s valve. It is also separated from the colon by the cecocolic junction. While the cecum is usually intraperitoneal, the ascending colon is retroperitoneal.

In herbivores, the cecum stores food material where bacteria are able to break down the cellulose. In humans, the cecum is involved in absorption of salts and electrolytes and lubricates the solid waste that passes into the large intestine.

==Structure==

===Development===
The cecum and appendix are derived from the bud of cecum that forms during week six in the midgut next to the apex of the umbilical herniation. Specifically, the cecum and appendix are formed by the enlargement of the postarterial segment of the midgut loop. The proximal part of the bud grows rapidly to form the cecum. The lateral wall of the cecum grows much more rapidly than the medial wall, with the result that the point of attachment of the appendix comes to lie on the medial side. The cecum&#x27;s position changes after the midgut rotates and the ascending colon elongates, and the accumulation of meconium inside the cecum may result in the latter&#x27;s increased diameter.

==History==
===Etymology===
The term &quot;cecum&quot; comes from Latin &quot;(intestinum) caecum&quot;, literally &#x27;blind intestine&#x27;, in the sense &#x27;blind gut&#x27; or &#x27;cul de sac&#x27;. It is a direct translation from Ancient Greek () (). Thus the inflammation of the cecum is called typhlitis.

In dissections by the Greek philosophers, the connection between the ileum of the small intestine and the cecum was not fully understood. Most of the studies of the digestive tract were done on animals and the results were compared to human structures.

The junction between the small intestine and the colon, called the ileocecal valve, is so small in some animals that it was not considered to be a connection between the small and large intestines. During a dissection, the colon could be traced from the rectum, to the sigmoid colon, through the descending, transverse, and ascending sections. The cecum is an end point for the colon with a dead-end portion terminating with the appendix.

The connection between the end of the small intestine (ileum) and the start (as viewed from the perspective of food being processed) of the colon (cecum) is now clearly understood, and is called the ileocecal orifice. The connection between the end of the cecum and the beginning of the ascending colon is called the cecocolic orifice.

==Clinical significance==
A cecal carcinoid tumor is a carcinoid tumor of the cecum. An appendiceal carcinoid tumor (a carcinoid tumor of the appendix) is sometimes found next to a cecal carcinoid.

Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis) is the condition of inflammation of the cecum, primarily caused by bacterial infections.

Over 99% of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobes, but in the cecum, aerobic bacteria reach high densities.

==Other animals==
A cecum is present in most amniote species, and also in lungfish, but not in any living species of amphibian. In reptiles, it is usually a single median structure, arising from the dorsal side of the large intestine. Birds typically have two paired ceca, as do, unlike other mammals, hyraxes. Parrots do not have ceca.

Most mammalian herbivores have a relatively large cecum. In many species, it is considerably wider than the colon. For some herbivores such as lagomorphs (rabbits, hares, pikas), easily digestible food is processed in the gastrointestinal tract and expelled as regular feces. But in order to get nutrients out of hard to digest fiber, lagomorphs ferment fiber in the cecum and then expel the contents as cecotropes, which are reingested (cecotrophy). The cecotropes are then absorbed in the small intestine to utilize the nutrients.

In contrast, obligate carnivores, whose diets contain little or no plant matter, have a reduced cecum, which is often partially or wholly replaced by the appendix. Mammalian species which do not develop a cecum include raccoons, bears, and the red panda.

Many fish have a number of small outpockets, called &quot;pyloric ceca&quot;, along their intestine; despite the name, they are not homologous with the cecum of amniotes – their purpose is to increase the overall area of the digestive epithelium. Some invertebrates, such as squid, may also have structures with the same name, but these have no relationship with those of vertebrates.

<doc id="99598" wikidata="Q7192" url="?curid=99598" title="Qin Shi Huang">
<text>Qin Shi Huang (, ; February 25912 July 210 BC) was the founder of the Qin dynasty and the first emperor of China. Rather than maintain the title of &quot;king&quot; ( ) borne by the previous Shang and Zhou rulers, he assumed the invented title of &quot;emperor&quot; ( ), which would see continuous use by monarchs in China for the next two millennia. 

Born in Handan, the capital of Zhao, as Ying Zheng () or Zhao Zheng (), his parents were King Zhuangxiang of Qin and Lady Zhao. The wealthy merchant Lü Buwei assisted him in succeeding his father as the king of Qin, after which he became King Zheng of Qin (). By 221 BC, he had conquered all the other warring states and unified all of China, and he ascended the throne as China&#x27;s first emperor. During his reign, his generals greatly expanded the size of the Chinese state: campaigns south of Chu permanently added the Yue lands of Hunan and Guangdong to the Sinosphere, and campaigns in Inner Asia conquered the Ordos Plateau from the nomadic Xiongnu, although the Xiongnu later rallied under Modu Chanyu.

Qin Shi Huang also worked with his minister Li Si to enact major economic and political reforms aimed at the standardization of the diverse practices among earlier Chinese states. He is traditionally said to have banned and burned many books and executed scholars. His public works projects included the incorporation of diverse state walls into a single Great Wall of China and a massive new national road system, as well as his city-sized mausoleum guarded by a life-sized Terracotta Army. He ruled until his death in 210 BC, during his fifth tour of eastern China.

Qin Shi Huang has often been portrayed as a tyrant and strict Legalist—characterizations that stem partly from the scathing assessments made during the Han dynasty that succeeded the Qin. Since the mid-20th century, scholars have begun questioning this evaluation, inciting considerable discussion on the actual nature of his policies and reforms. According to the sinologist Michael Loewe &quot;few would contest the view that the achievements of his reign have exercised a paramount influence on the whole of China&#x27;s subsequent history, marking the start of an epoch that closed in 1911&quot;.

== Names ==
Modern Chinese sources often give the personal name of Qin Shi Huang as Ying Zheng, with Yíng () taken as the surname and Zheng () the given name. However, in ancient China, the naming convention differed, and the clan name Zhao (), the place where he was born and raised, may be used as the surname. Unlike modern Chinese names, the nobility of ancient China had two distinct surnames: the ancestral name () comprised a larger group descended from a prominent ancestor, usually said to have lived during the time of the legendary Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, and the clan name () comprised a smaller group that showed a branch&#x27;s current fief or recent title. The ancient practice was to list men&#x27;s names separately—Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Basic Annals of the First Emperor of Qin&quot; introduces him as &quot;given the name Zheng and the surname Zhao&quot;—or to combine the clan surname with the personal name: Sima&#x27;s account of Chu describes the sixteenth year of the reign of King Kaolie as &quot;the time when Zhao Zheng was enthroned as King of Qin&quot;. However, since modern Chinese surnames (despite usually descending from clan names) use the same character as the old &quot;ancestral&quot; names, it is much more common in modern Chinese sources to see the emperor&#x27;s personal name written as Ying Zheng, using the ancestral name of the House of Ying.

The rulers of the state of Qin had styled themselves kings from the time of King Huiwen in 325 BC. Upon his ascension, Zheng became known as the King of Qin or King Zheng of Qin. This title made him the nominal equal of the rulers of Shang and Zhou, the last of whose kings had been deposed by King Zhaoxiang of Qin in 256 BC.

Following the surrender of Qi in 221 BC, King Zheng reunited all of the lands of the former Kingdom of Zhou. Rather than maintain his rank as king, however, he created a new title of (emperor) for himself. This new title combined two titles— of the mythical Three Sovereigns (, ) and the &quot;dì&quot; of the legendary Five Emperors (, &quot;Wŭ Dì&quot;) of Chinese prehistory. The title was intended to appropriate some of the prestige of the Yellow Emperor, whose cult was popular in the later Warring States period and who was considered to be a founder of the Chinese people. King Zheng chose the new regnal name of First Emperor (&quot;Shǐ Huángdì&quot;, Wade-Giles Shih Huang-ti) on the understanding that his successors would be successively titled the &quot;Second Emperor&quot;, &quot;Third Emperor&quot;, and so on through the generations. (In fact, the scheme lasted only as long as his immediate heir, the Second Emperor.) The new title carried religious overtones. For that reason, sinologists starting with Peter A. Boodberg or Edward H. Schafer—sometimes translate it as &quot;thearch&quot; and the First Emperor as the First Thearch.

The First Emperor intended that his realm would remain intact through the ages but, following its overthrow and replacement by Han after his death, it became customary to prefix his title with Qin. Thus:
* , &quot;Qín&quot; or Ch&#x27;in, &quot;of Qin&quot;
* , &quot;Shǐ&quot; or Shih, &quot;first&quot;
* , &quot;Huángdì&quot; or Huang-ti, &quot;emperor&quot;, a new term coined from
** , &quot;Huáng&quot; or Huang, literally &quot;shining&quot; or &quot;splendid&quot; and formerly most usually applied &quot;as an epithet of Heaven&quot;, a title of the Three Sovereigns, the high god of the Zhou
** , &quot;Dì&quot; or Ti, the high god of the Shang dynasty, possibly composed of their divine ancestors, and used by the Zhou as a title of the legendary Five Emperors, particularly the Yellow Emperor

As early as Sima Qian, it was common to shorten the resulting four-character Qin Shi Huangdi to , variously transcribed as Qin Shihuang or Qin Shi Huang.

Following his elevation as emperor, both Zheng&#x27;s personal name and possibly its homophone became taboo. The First Emperor also arrogated the first-person pronoun for his exclusive use, and in 212 BC began calling himself The Immortal Others were to address him as &quot;Your Majesty&quot; in person and &quot;Your Highness&quot; () in writing.

==Birth and parentage==
According to the &quot;Shiji&quot; written by Sima Qian during the Han dynasty, the first emperor was the eldest son of the Qin prince Yiren, who later became King Zhuangxiang of Qin. Prince Yiren at that time was residing at the court of Zhao, serving as a hostage to guarantee the armistice between Qin and Zhao. Prince Yiren had fallen in love at first sight with a concubine of Lü Buwei, a rich merchant from the state of Wey. Lü consented for her to be Yiren&#x27;s wife, who then became known as Lady Zhao after the state of Zhao. He was given the name Zhao Zheng, the name Zheng () came from his month of birth &quot;Zhengyue&quot;, the first month of the Chinese lunar calendar; the clan name of Zhao came from his father&#x27;s lineage and was unrelated to either his mother&#x27;s name or the location of his birth. ( says that his birthday, significantly, was on the first day of &quot;Zhengyue&quot;.) Lü Buwei&#x27;s machinations later helped Yiren become King Zhuangxiang of Qin in 250 BC. 

However, the &quot;Shiji&quot; also claimed that the first emperor was not the actual son of Prince Yiren but that of Lü Buwei. According to this account, when Lü Buwei introduced the dancing girl to the prince, she was Lü Buwei&#x27;s concubine and had already become pregnant by him, and the baby was born after an unusually long period of pregnancy. According to translations of the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, Zhao Ji gave birth to the future emperor in the city of Handan in 259 BC, the first month of the 48th year of King Zhaoxiang of Qin.

The idea that the emperor was an illegitimate child, widely believed throughout Chinese history, contributed to the generally negative view of the First Emperor. However, a number of modern scholars have doubted this account of his birth. Sinologist Derk Bodde wrote: &quot;There is good reason for believing that the sentence describing this unusual pregnancy is an interpolation added to the &quot;Shiji&quot; by an unknown person in order to slander the First Emperor and indicate his political as well as natal illegitimacy&quot;. John Knoblock and Jeffrey Riegel, in their translation of Lü Buwei&#x27;s &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, call the story &quot;patently false, meant both to libel Lü and to cast aspersions on the First Emperor&quot;. Claiming Lü Buwei—a merchant—as the First Emperor&#x27;s biological father was meant to be especially disparaging, since later Confucian society regarded merchants as the lowest social class.

==Reign as King of Qin==

===Regency===

In 246 BC, when King Zhuangxiang died after a short reign of just three years, he was succeeded on the throne by his 13-year-old son. At the time, Zhao Zheng was still young, so Lü Buwei acted as the regent prime minister of the State of Qin, which was still waging war against the other six states. Nine years later, in 235 BC, Zhao Zheng assumed full power after Lü Buwei was banished for his involvement in a scandal with Queen Dowager Zhao.

Zhao Chengjiao, the Lord Chang&#x27;an (), was Zhao Zheng&#x27;s legitimate half-brother, by the same father but from a different mother. After Zhao Zheng inherited the throne, Chengjiao rebelled at Tunliu and surrendered to the state of Zhao. Chengjiao&#x27;s remaining retainers and families were executed by Zhao Zheng.

===Lao Ai&#x27;s attempted coup===
As King Zheng grew older, Lü Buwei became fearful that the boy king would discover his liaison with his mother, Lady Zhao. He decided to distance himself and look for a replacement for the queen dowager. He found a man named Lao Ai. According to &quot;The Record of Grand Historian&quot;, Lao Ai was disguised as a eunuch by plucking his beard. Later Lao Ai and queen Zhao Ji got along so well that they secretly had two sons together. Lao Ai was ennobled as Marquis, and was showered with riches. Lao Ai had been planning to replace King Zheng with one of his own sons, but during a dinner party he was heard bragging about being the young king&#x27;s stepfather. In 238 BC, while the king was travelling to the former capital, Yong (), Lao Ai seized the queen mother&#x27;s seal and mobilized an army in an attempted coup d&#x27;état. When notified of the rebellion, King Zheng ordered Lü Buwei to let Lord Changping and attack Lao Ai. Although the royal army killed hundreds of rebels at the capital, Lao Ai successfully fled the battlefield.

A price of 1 million copper coins was placed on Lao Ai&#x27;s head if he was taken alive or half a million if dead. Lao Ai&#x27;s supporters were captured and beheaded; then Lao Ai was tied up and torn to five pieces by horse carriages, while his entire family was executed to the third degree. The two hidden sons were also killed, while the mother Zhao Ji was placed under house arrest until her death many years later. Lü Buwei drank a cup of poisoned wine and committed suicide in 235 BC. Ying Zheng then assumed full power as the King of the Qin state. Replacing Lü Buwei, Li Si became the new chancellor.

===First assassination attempt===

King Zheng and his troops continued their conquest of the neighbouring states. The state of Yan was no match for the Qin states: small and weak, it had already been harassed frequently by Qin soldiers. Crown Prince Dan of Yan plotted an assassination attempt against King Zheng, recruiting Jing Ke and Qin Wuyang for the mission in 227 BC. 

The assassins gained access to King Zheng by pretending a diplomatic gifting of goodwill: a map of Dukang and the severed head of Fan Wuji. Qin Wuyang stepped forward first to present the map case but was overcome by fear. Jing Ke then advanced with both gifts, while explaining that his partner was trembling because &quot;[he] had never set eyes on the Son of Heaven&quot;. When the dagger unrolled from the map, the king leapt to his feet and struggled to draw his swordnone of his courtiers were allowed to carry arms in his presence. Jing stabbed at the king but missed, and King Zheng slashed Jing&#x27;s thigh. In desperation, Jing Ke threw the dagger but missed again. He surrendered after a brief fight in which he was further injured. The Yan state was conquered in its entirety five years later.

===Second assassination attempt===
Gao Jianli was a close friend of Jing Ke, and wanted to avenge his death. As a famous &quot;zhu&quot; player, he was summoned to play for King Zheng. Someone in the palace recognized him and guessed his plans. Reluctant to kill such a skilled musician, the king ordered his eyes put out, and then proceeded with the performance. The king praised Gao&#x27;s playing and even allowed him closer. The &quot;zhu&quot; had been weighted with a slab of lead, and Gao Jianli swung it at the king but missed. The second assassination attempt had failed; Gao was executed shortly after.

===Unification of China===
In 230 BC, King Zheng began the final campaigns of the Warring States period, setting out to conquer the remaining six major Chinese states and bring China under unified Qin control.

The state of Han, the weakest of the Warring States, was the first to fall in 230 BC. In 229, Qin armies invaded Zhao, which had been severely weakened by natural disasters, and captured the capital of Handan in 228. Prince Jia of Zhao managed to escape with the remnants of the Zhao army and established the short-lived state of Dai, proclaiming himself king.

In 227 BC, fearing a Qin invasion, Crown Prince Dan of Yan ordered a failed assassination attempt on King Zheng. This provided &quot;casus belli&quot; for Zheng to invade Yan in 226, capturing the capital of Ji (modern Beijing) that same year. The remnants of the Yan army, along with King Xi of Yan, were able to retreat to the Liaodong Peninsula. 

After Qin besieged and flooded their capital of Daliang, the state of Wei surrendered in 225 BC. Around this time, as a precautionary measure, Qin seized ten cities from Chu, the largest and most powerful of the other Warring States. In 224, Qin launched a full-scale invasion of Chu, capturing the capital of Shouchun in 223. In 222, Qin armies extinguished the last Yan remnants in Liaodong and the Zhao rump state of Dai. In 221, Qin armies invaded the state of Qi and captured King Jian of Qi without much resistance, bringing an end to the Warring States period.

By 221 BC, all Chinese lands had been unified under the Qin. To elevate himself above the feudal Zhou kings, King Zheng proclaimed himself the First Emperor, creating the title which would be used as the title of the Chinese sovereign for the next two millennia. Qin Shi Huang also ordered the &quot;Heshibi&quot; to be crafted into the Heirloom Seal of the Realm, which would serve as a physical symbol of the Mandate of Heaven, and would be passed from emperor to emperor until its loss in the 10th century.

During 215 BC, in an attempt to expand Qin territory, Qin Shi Huang ordered military campaigns against the Xiongnu nomads in the North. Led by General Meng Tian, Qin armies successfully routed the Xiongnu from the Ordos Plateau, setting the ancient foundations for the construction of the Great Wall of China. In the South, Qin Shi Huang also ordered several military campaigns against the Yue tribes, which annexed various regions in modern Guangdong and Vietnam.

==Reign as Emperor of Qin==
===Administrative reforms===
In an attempt to avoid a recurrence of the political chaos of the Warring States period, Qin Shi Huang and Li Si worked to completely abolish the feudal system of loose alliances and federations. They organized the empire into administrative units and subunits: first 36 (later 40) commanderies, then counties, townships, and hundred-family units (里, &quot;Li&quot;, roughly corresponding to modern-day subdistricts and communities). People assigned to these units would no longer be identified by their native region or former feudal state, for example &quot;Chu person&quot; (楚人, &quot;Chu rén&quot;). Appointments were to be based on merit instead of hereditary right.

===Economic reforms===
Qin Shi Huang and Li Si unified China economically by standardizing the weights and measurements. Wagon axles were prescribed a standard length to facilitate road transport. The emperor also developed an extensive network of roads and canals for trade and communication. The currencies of the different states were standardized to the Ban Liang coin. The forms of Chinese characters were unified. Under Li Si, the seal script of the state of Qin became the official standard, and the Qin script itself was simplified through removal of variant forms. This did away with all the regional scripts to form a universal written language for all of China, despite the diversity of spoken dialects.

===Monumental statuary===
According to Chinese records, after unifying the country in 221 BC, Qin Shuhuang confiscated all the bronze weapons of the conquered countries, and cast them into twelve monumental statues, the &quot;Twelve Metal Colossi&quot;, which he used to adorn his Palace. Each statue was said to be 5 zhang [11.5 meters] in height, and weighing about 1000 dan [about 70 tons]. Sima Qian considered this as one of the great achievements of the Emperor, on a par with the &quot;unification of the law, weights and measurements, standardization of the axle width of carriages, and standardization of the writing system&quot;. During 600 years, the statues were commented upon and moved around from palace to palace, until they were finally destroyed in the 4th century AD, but no illustration has remained.

===Philosophy===

While the previous Warring States era was one of constant warfare, it was also considered the golden age of free thought. Qin Shi Huang eliminated the Hundred Schools of Thought, which included Confucianism and other philosophies. With all other philosophies banned, Legalism became the mandatory ideology of the Qin dynasty. 

Beginning in 213 BC, at the instigation of Li Si and to avoid scholars&#x27; comparisons of his reign with the past, Qin Shi Huang ordered most existing books to be burned, with the exception of those on astrology, agriculture, medicine, divination, and the history of the state of Qin. This would also serve to further the ongoing reformation of the writing system by removing examples of obsolete scripts. Owning the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; or the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; was to be punished especially severely. According to the later &quot;Shiji&quot;, the following year Qin Shi Huang had some 460 scholars buried alive for possessing the forbidden books. The emperor&#x27;s oldest son Fusu criticized him for this act. The emperor&#x27;s own library did retain copies of the forbidden books, but most of these were destroyed when Xiang Yu burned the palaces of Xianyang in 206 BC.

Recent research suggests that this &quot;burying Confucian scholars alive&quot; is a Confucian martyrs&#x27; legend. More probably, the emperor ordered the execution of a group of alchemists who had deceived him. In the subsequent Han dynasty, the Confucian scholars, who had served the Qin loyally, used this incident to distance themselves from the failed regime. Kong Anguo (), a descendant of Confucius, described the alchemists as Confucianists and entwined the martyrs&#x27; legend with his story of discovering the lost Confucian books behind a demolished wall in his ancestral house.

Qin Shi Huang also followed the theory of the five elements: fire, water, earth, wood, and metal. It was believed that the royal house of the previous Zhou dynasty had ruled by the power of fire, associated with the colour red. The new Qin dynasty must be ruled by the next element on the list, which is water, Zhao Zheng&#x27;s birth element. Water was represented by the colour black, and black became the preferred colour for Qin garments, flags, and pennants. Other associations include north as the cardinal direction, the winter season and the number six. Tallies and official hats were long, carriages wide, one pace () was .

===Third assassination attempt===
In 230 BC, the state of Qin had defeated the state of Han. In 218, a former Han aristocrat named Zhang Liang swore revenge on Qin Shi Huang. He sold his valuables and hired a strongman assassin, building a heavy metal cone weighing 120 catties (roughly 160 lb or 97 kg). The two men hid among the bushes along the emperor&#x27;s route over a mountain during his third imperial tour. At a signal, the muscular assassin hurled the cone at the first carriage and shattered it. However, the emperor was travelling with two identical carriages to baffle attackers, and he was actually in the second carriage. Thus the attempt failed, though both men were able to escape the subsequent manhunt.

===Public works===

====Great Wall====

Numerous state walls had been built during the previous four centuries, many of them closing gaps between river defences and impassable cliffs. To impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, the Emperor ordered the destruction of walls between the former states, which were now internal walls dividing the empire. 

However, to defend against the northern Xiongnu nomads, who had beaten back repeated campaigns against them, he ordered new walls to connect the fortifications along the empire&#x27;s northern frontier. Hundreds of thousands of workers were mobilized, and an unknown number died, to build this precursor to the current Great Wall of China. Transporting building materials was difficult, so builders always tried to use local materials: rock over mountain ranges, rammed earth over the plains. &quot;Build and move on&quot; was a guiding principle, implying that the Wall was not a permanently fixed border. There are no surviving records specifying the length and course of the Qin walls, which have largely eroded away over the centuries.

====Lingqu Canal====

In 214 BC the Emperor began the project of a major canal allowing water transport between north and south China, originally for military supplies. The canal, 34 kilometres in length, links two of China&#x27;s major waterways, the Xiang River flowing into the Yangtze and the Lijiang River, flowing into the Pearl River. The canal aided Qin&#x27;s expansion to the south-west. It is considered one of the three great feats of ancient Chinese engineering, along with the Great Wall and the Sichuan Dujiangyan Irrigation System.

===Elixir of life===

As he grew old, Qin Shi Huang desperately sought the fabled elixir of life which supposedly confers immortality. In his obsessive quest, he fell prey to many fraudulent elixirs. He visited Zhifu Island three times in his search.

In one case he sent Xu Fu, a Zhifu islander, with ships carrying hundreds of young men and women in search of the mystical Mount Penglai. They sought Anqi Sheng, a thousand-year-old magician who had supposedly invited Qin Shi Huang during a chance meeting during his travels. The expedition never returned, perhaps for fear of the consequences of failure. Legends claim that they reached Japan and colonized it. 

It is also possible that the Emperor&#x27;s book burning, which exempted alchemical works, could be seen as an attempt to focus the minds of the best scholars on the Emperor&#x27;s quest. Some of those buried alive were alchemists, and this could have been a means of testing their death-defying abilities. 

The emperor built a system of tunnels and passageways to each of his over 200 palaces, because travelling unseen would supposedly keep him safe from evil spirits.

==Final years==
===Death===

In 211 BC, a large meteor is said to have fallen in Dongjun in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, and someone inscribed the seditious words &quot;The First Emperor will die and his land will be divided&quot; (). The Emperor sent an imperial secretary to investigate this prophecy. No one would confess to the deed, so all living nearby were put to death, and the stone was pulverized.

During his fifth tour of eastern China, the Emperor became seriously ill in Pingyuanjin (Pingyuan County, Shandong), and died in July or August of 210 BC, at the palace in Shaqiu prefecture, about two months travel from Xianyang, at the age of 49.

The cause of Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s death remains unknown, though he had been worn down by his many years of rule. One hypothesis holds that he was poisoned by an elixir containing mercury, given to him by his court alchemists and physicians in his quest for immortality.

===Succession===
Upon witnessing the Emperor&#x27;s death, Chancellor Li Si feared the news could trigger a general uprising during the two months&#x27; travel for the imperial entourage to return to the capital Xianyang. Li Si decided to hide the emperor&#x27;s death: the only members of the entourage to be informed were a younger son, Ying Huhai, the eunuch Zhao Gao, and five or six favourite eunuchs. Li Si ordered carts of rotten fish to be carried before and behind the wagon of the Emperor, to cover the foul smell of his body decomposing in the summer heat. Pretending he was alive behind the wagon&#x27;s shade, they changed his clothes daily, brought food, and pretended to carry messages to and from him.

After they reached Xianyang, the death of the Emperor was announced. Qin Shi Huang had not liked to talk about his death and had never written a will. Although his eldest son Fusu was first in line to succeed him as emperor, Li Si and the chief eunuch Zhao Gao conspired to kill Fusu, who was in league with their enemy, general Meng Tian. Meng Tian&#x27;s brother Meng Yi, a senior minister, had once punished Zhao Gao. Li Si and Zhao Gao forged a letter from Qin Shi Huang commanding Fusu and General Meng to commit suicide. The plan worked, and the younger son Hu Hai started his brief reign as the Second Emperor, later known as Qin Er Shi or &quot;Second Generation Qin&quot;.

==Family==

The immediate family members of Qin Shi Huang include:
* Parents
** King Zhuangxiang of Qin
** Queen Dowager Zhao
* Half-siblings:
** Chengjiao, legitimate paternal half brother from a different mother Lord of Chang&#x27;an
** Two illegitimate maternal half-brothers born to Queen Dowager Zhao and Lao Ai.
* Children:
** Fusu, Crown Prince (1st son)
** Gao
** Jianglü
** Huhai, later Qin Er Shi (18th son)

Qin Shi Huang had about 50 children (about 30 sons and 15 daughters), but most of their names are unknown. He had numerous concubines but appeared to have never named an empress.

==Legacy==
===Mausoleum and Terracotta Army===

Sima Qian, writing a century after the First Emperor&#x27;s death, wrote that it took 700,000 men to construct the emperor&#x27;s mausoleum. British historian John Man points out that this figure is larger than the population of any city in the world at that time and he calculates that the foundations could have been built by 16,000 men in two years. Sima Qian never mentioned the Terracotta Army, but he did mention that the Qin Emperor built monumental bronze statues for his palace. The terracotta statues were discovered by a group of farmers digging wells on 29 March 1974. The soldiers were created with a series of mix-and-match clay molds and then further individualized by the artists&#x27; hand. Han Purple was also used on some of the warriors.
There are around 6,000 statues, whose purpose was to protect the Emperor in the afterlife from evil spirits. Also among the army are chariots and 40,000 real bronze weapons.

One of the first projects which the young king accomplished while he was alive was the construction of his own tomb. In 215 BC Qin Shi Huang ordered General Meng Tian to begin its construction with the assistance of 300,000 men. Other sources suggest that he ordered 720,000 unpaid laborers to build his tomb according to his specifications. Again, given John Man&#x27;s observation regarding populations at the time (see paragraph above), these historical estimates are debatable. The main tomb (located at ) containing the emperor has yet to be opened and evidence suggests that it remains relatively intact. Sima Qian&#x27;s description of the tomb includes replicas of palaces and scenic towers, &quot;rare utensils and wonderful objects&quot;, 100 rivers made with mercury, representations of &quot;the heavenly bodies&quot;, and crossbows rigged to shoot anyone who tried to break in. The tomb was built at the foot of Mount Li, 30 kilometers away from Xi&#x27;an. Modern archaeologists have located the tomb, and have inserted probes deep into it. The probes revealed abnormally high quantities of mercury, some 100 times the naturally occurring rate, suggesting that some parts of the legend are credible. Secrets were maintained, as most of the workmen who built the tomb were killed.

===Reputation and assessment===

Traditional Chinese historiography almost always portrayed the Emperor as a brutal tyrant who had an obsessive fear of assassination. Ideological antipathy towards the Legalist State of Qin was established as early as 266 BC, when Confucian philosopher Xunzi disparaged it. Later Confucian historians condemned the emperor, alleging that he burned the classics and buried Confucian scholars alive. They eventually compiled a list of the &quot;Ten Crimes of Qin&quot; to highlight his tyrannical actions.

The famous Han poet and statesman Jia Yi concluded his essay &quot;The Faults of Qin&quot; (過秦論, &quot;Guò Qín Lùn&quot;) with what was to become the standard Confucian judgment of the reasons for Qin&#x27;s collapse. Jia Yi&#x27;s essay, admired as a masterpiece of rhetoric and reasoning, was copied into two great Han histories and has had a far-reaching influence on Chinese political thought as a classic illustration of Confucian theory. He attributed Qin&#x27;s disintegration to its internal failures. Jia Yi wrote that:

In the modern period, assessments began to emerge that differed from those of traditional historiography. The reassessment was spurred on by the weakness of China in the latter half of the 19th century and early 20th century. At that time, some began to regard Confucian traditions as an impediment to China&#x27;s entry into the modern world, opening the way for changing perspectives.

At a time when foreign nations encroached upon Chinese territory, leading Kuomintang historian Xiao Yishan emphasized the role of Qin Shi Huang in repulsing the northern barbarians, particularly in the construction of the Great Wall.

Another historian, Ma Feibai (), published in 1941 a full-length revisionist biography of the First Emperor entitled &quot;Qín Shǐ Huángdì Zhuàn&quot; (), calling him &quot;one of the great heroes of Chinese history&quot;. Ma compared him with the contemporary leader Chiang Kai-shek and saw many parallels in the careers and policies of the two men, both of whom he admired. Chiang&#x27;s Northern Expedition of the late 1920s, which directly preceded the new Nationalist government at Nanjing was compared to the unification brought about by Qin Shi Huang.

With the advent of the Chinese Communist Revolution and the establishment of a new, revolutionary regime in 1949, another re-evaluation of the First Emperor emerged as a Marxist critique. This new interpretation of Qin Shi Huang was generally a combination of traditional and modern views, but essentially critical. This is exemplified in the &quot;Complete History of China&quot;, which was compiled in September 1955 as an official survey of Chinese history. The work described the First Emperor&#x27;s major steps toward unification and standardisation as corresponding to the interests of the ruling group and the merchant class, not of the nation or the people, and the subsequent fall of his dynasty as a manifestation of the class struggle. The perennial debate about the fall of the Qin dynasty was also explained in Marxist terms, the peasant rebellions being a revolt against oppression—a revolt which undermined the dynasty, but which was bound to fail because of a compromise with &quot;landlord class elements&quot;.

On hearing he&#x27;d been compared to the First Emperor for his persecution of intellectuals, Mao Zedong reportedly boasted in 1958:
Since 1972, however, a radically different official view of Qin Shi Huang in accordance with Maoist thought has been given prominence throughout China. Hong Shidi&#x27;s biography &quot;Qin Shi Huang&quot; initiated the re-evaluation. The work was published by the state press as a mass popular history, and it sold 1.85 million copies within two years. In the new era, Qin Shi Huang was seen as a far-sighted ruler who destroyed the forces of division and established the first unified, centralized state in Chinese history by rejecting the past. Personal attributes, such as his quest for immortality, so emphasized in traditional historiography, were scarcely mentioned. The new evaluations described approvingly how, in his time (an era of great political and social change), he had no compunctions against using violent methods to crush counter-revolutionaries, such as the &quot;industrial and commercial slave owner&quot; chancellor Lü Buwei. However, he was criticized for not being as thorough as he should have been, and as a result, after his death, hidden subversives under the leadership of the chief eunuch Zhao Gao were able to seize power and use it to restore the old feudal order.

To round out this re-evaluation, Luo Siding put forward a new interpretation of the precipitous collapse of the Qin dynasty in an article entitled &quot;On the Class Struggle During the Period Between Qin and Han&quot; in a 1974 issue of &quot;Red Flag&quot;, to replace the old explanation. The new theory claimed that the cause of the fall of Qin lay in the lack of thoroughness of Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s &quot;dictatorship over the reactionaries, even to the extent of permitting them to worm their way into organs of political authority and usurp important posts.&quot;

<text>The ileum () is the final section of the small intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear and the terms posterior intestine or distal intestine may be used instead of ileum. Its main function is to absorb vitamin B12, bile salts, and whatever products of digestion that were not absorbed by the jejunum.

The ileum follows the duodenum and jejunum and is separated from the cecum by the ileocecal valve (ICV). In humans, the ileum is about 2–4 m long, and the pH is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or slightly basic).

&quot;Ileum&quot; is derived from the Greek word εἰλεός (eileós), referring to a medical condition known as ileus.

==Structure==
The ileum is the third and final part of the small intestine. It follows the jejunum and ends at the ileocecal junction, where the ileum communicates with the cecum of the large intestine through the ileocecal valve. The ileum, along with the jejunum, is suspended inside the mesentery, a peritoneal formation that carries the blood vessels supplying them (the superior mesenteric artery and vein), lymphatic vessels and nerve fibers.

There is no line of demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum. There are, however, subtle differences between the two:
* The ileum has more fat inside the mesentery than the jejunum.
* The diameter of its lumen is smaller and has thinner walls than the jejunum.
* Its circular folds are smaller and absent in the terminal part of the ileum.
* While the length of the intestinal tract contains lymphoid tissue, only the ileum has abundant Peyer&#x27;s patches, unencapsulated lymphoid nodules that contain large numbers of lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system.

===Histology===
The four layers that make up the wall of the ileum are consistent with those of the gastrointestinal tract. From the inner to the outer surface, these are:
* A mucous membrane, itself formed by three different layers:
** A single layer of tall cells that line the lumen of the organ. The epithelium that forms the innermost part of the mucosa has five distinct types of cells that serve different purposes: enterocytes with microvilli, which digest and absorb nutrients; goblet cells, which secrete mucin, a substance that lubricates the wall of the organ; Paneth cells, most common in the terminal part of the ileum, are only found at the bottom of the intestinal glands and release antimicrobial substances such as alpha defensins and lysozyme; microfold cells, which take up and transport antigens from the lumen to lymphatic cells of the lamina propria; and enteroendocrine cells, which secrete hormones.
** An underlying lamina propria composed of loose connective tissue and containing germinal centers and large aggregates of lymphoid tissue called Peyer&#x27;s patches, which are a distinctive feature of the ileum.
** A thin layer of smooth muscle called muscularis mucosae
* A submucosa formed by dense irregular connective tissue that carries the larger blood vessels and a nervous component called submucosal plexus, which is part of the enteric nervous system
* An external muscular layer formed by two layers of smooth muscle arranged in circular bundles in the inner layer and in longitudinal bundles in the outer layer. Between the two layers is the myenteric plexus, formed by nervous tissue and also a part of the enteric nervous system.
* A serosa composed of mesothelium, a single layer of flat cells with varying quantities of underlying connective and adipose tissue. This layer represents the visceral peritoneum and is continuous with the mesentery.
===Development===
The small intestine develops from the midgut of the primitive gut tube. By the fifth week of embryological life, the ileum begins to grow longer at a very fast rate, forming a U-shaped fold called the primary intestinal loop. The proximal half of this loop will form the ileum. The loop grows so fast in length that it outgrows the abdomen and protrudes through the umbilicus. By week 10, the loop retracts back into the abdomen. Between weeks six and ten the small intestine rotates anticlockwise, as viewed from the front of the embryo. It rotates a further 180 degrees after it has moved back into the abdomen. This process creates the twisted shape of the large intestine.

In the fetus the ileum is connected to the navel by the vitelline duct. In roughly 2−4% of humans, this duct fails to close during the first seven weeks after birth, leaving a remnant called Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum.

==Function==
The main function of the ileum is to absorb vitamin B12, bile salts, and whatever products of digestion were not absorbed by the jejunum. The wall itself is made up of folds, each of which has many tiny finger-like projections known as villi on its surface. In turn, the epithelial cells that line these villi possess even larger numbers of microvilli. Therefore, the ileum has an extremely large surface area both for the adsorption (attachment) of enzyme molecules and for the absorption of products of digestion. The DNES (diffuse neuroendocrine system) cells of the ileum secrete various hormones (gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin) into the blood. Cells in the lining of the ileum secrete the protease and carbohydrase enzymes responsible for the final stages of protein and carbohydrate digestion into the lumen of the intestine. These enzymes are present in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells.

The villi contain large numbers of capillaries that take the amino acids and glucose produced by digestion to the hepatic portal vein and the liver. Lacteals are small lymph vessels, and are present in villi. They absorb fatty acid and glycerol, the products of fat digestion. Layers of circular and longitudinal smooth muscle enable the chyme (partly digested food and water) to be pushed along the ileum by waves of muscle contractions called peristalsis. The remaining chyme is passed to the colon.

==Clinical significance==
It is of importance in medicine as it can be affected in a number of diseases, including:
* Crohn&#x27;s disease
* Tuberculosis
* Lymphoma
* Neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid)

==Other animals==
In veterinary anatomy, the ileum is distinguished from the jejunum by being that portion of the jejunoileum that is connected to the caecum by the ileocecal fold.

The ileum is the short termi of the small intestine and the connection to the large intestine. It is suspended by the caudal part of the mesentery (mesoileum) and is attached, in addition, to the cecum by the ileocecal fold. The ileum terminates at the cecocolic junction of the large intestine forming the ileal orifice. In the dog the ileal orifice is located at the level of the first or second lumbar vertebra, in the ox in the level of the fourth lumbar vertebrae, in the sheep and goat at the level of the caudal point of the costal arch. By active muscular contraction of the ileum, and closure of the ileal opening as a result of engorgement, the ileum prevents the backflow of ingesta and the equalization of pressure between jejunum and the base of the cecum. Disturbance of this sensitive balance is not uncommon and is one of the causes of colic in horses. During any intestinal surgery, for instance, during appendectomy, distal 2 feet of ileum should be checked for the presence of Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum.

<doc id="99601" wikidata="Q727385" url="?curid=99601" title="Pollarding">
<text>Pollarding is a pruning system involving the removal of the upper branches of a tree, which promotes the growth of a dense head of foliage and branches. In ancient Rome, Propertius mentioned pollarding during the 1st century BCE. The practice has occurred commonly in Europe since medieval times, and takes place today in urban areas worldwide, primarily to maintain trees at a determined height or to place new shoots out of the reach of grazing animals.

Traditionally, people pollarded trees for one of two reasons: for fodder to feed livestock or for wood. Fodder pollards produced &quot;pollard hay&quot; for livestock feed; they were pruned at intervals of two to six years so their leafy material would be most abundant. Wood pollards were pruned at longer intervals of eight to fifteen years, a pruning cycle tending to produce upright poles favored for fencing and boat construction. Supple young willow or hazel branches may be harvested as material for weaving baskets, fences, and garden constructions such as bowers. Nowadays, the practice is sometimes used for ornamental trees, such as crape myrtles in southern states of the US.

Pollarding tends to make trees live longer by maintaining them in a partially juvenile state and by reducing the weight and windage of the top part of the tree. Older pollards often become hollow, so it can be difficult to determine age accurately. Pollards tend to grow slowly, with denser growth-rings in the years immediately after cutting.

==Practice==

As in coppicing, pollarding is to encourage the tree to produce new growth on a regular basis to maintain a supply of new wood for various purposes, particularly for fuel. In some areas, dried leafy branches are stored as winter fodder for stock. Depending on the use of the cut material, the length of time between cutting will vary from one year for tree hay or withies, to five years or more for larger timber. Sometimes, only some of the regrown stems may be cut in a seasonthis is thought to reduce the chances of death of the tree when recutting long-neglected pollards.

Pollarding was preferred over coppicing in wood-pastures and other grazed areas, because animals would browse the regrowth from coppice stools. Historically in England, the right to pollard or &quot;lop&quot; was often granted to local people for fuel on common land or in royal forests; this was part of the right of estover.
An incidental effect of pollarding in woodland is the encouragement of underbrush growth due to increased light reaching the woodland floor. This can increase species diversity. However, in woodland where pollarding was once common but has now ceased, the opposite effect occurs, as the side and top shoots develop into trunk-sized branches. An example of this can be seen in Epping Forest, which is within both London and Essex, UK, the majority of which was pollarded until the late 19th century. Here, the light that reaches the woodland floor is limited owing to the thick growth of the pollarded trees.

Pollards cut at about a metre above the ground are called stubs (or stubbs). These were often used as markers in coppice or other woodland. Stubs cannot be used where the trees are browsed by animals, as the regrowing shoots are below the browse line.

==Species==

As with coppicing, only species with vigorous epicormic growth may be pollarded. In these species (which include many broadleaved trees but few conifers), removal of the main apical stems releases the growth of many dormant buds under the bark on the lower part of the tree. Trees without this growth will die without their leaves and branches. Some smaller tree species do not readily form pollards, because cutting the main stem stimulates growth from the base, effectively forming a coppice stool instead. Examples of trees that do well as pollards include broadleaves such as beeches (&quot;Fagus&quot;), oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot;), maples (&quot;Acer&quot;), black locust or false acacia (&quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot;), hornbeams (&quot;Carpinus&quot;), lindens and limes (&quot;Tilia&quot;), planes (&quot;Platanus&quot;), horse chestnuts (&quot;Aesculus&quot;), mulberries (&quot;Morus&quot;), Eastern redbud (&quot;Cercis canadensis&quot;), tree of heaven (&quot;Ailanthus altissima&quot;), willows (&quot;Salix&quot;), and a few conifers, such as yews (&quot;Taxus&quot;).

Pollarding is also used in urban forestry in certain areas for reasons such as tree size management, safety, and health concerns. It removes rotting or diseased branches to support the overall health of the tree and removes living and dead branches that could harm property and people, as well as increasing the amount of foliage in spring for aesthetic, shade and air quality reasons. Some trees may be rejuvenated by pollardingfor example, Bradford pear (&quot;Pyrus calleryana&quot; &#x27;Bradford&#x27;), a flowering species that becomes brittle and top-heavy when older.

Oaks, when very old, can form new trunks from the growth of pollard branches; that is, surviving branches which have split away from the main branch naturally.

In Japan, &quot;Daisugi&quot; is practiced on &quot;Cryptomeria&quot;. The technique is used in Africa for moringa trees to bring the nutritious leaves into easier reach for harvesting.

==Origin and usage of term==
&quot;Poll&quot; was originally a name for the top of the head, and &quot;to poll&quot; was a verb meaning &#x27;to crop the hair&#x27;. This use was extended to similar treatment of the branches of trees and the horns of animals. A pollard simply meant someone or something that had been polled (similar to the formation of &quot;drunkard&quot; and &quot;sluggard&quot;); for example, a hornless ox or polled livestock. Later, the noun &quot;pollard&quot; came to be used as a verb: &quot;pollarding&quot;. Pollarding has now largely replaced polling as the verb in the forestry sense. Pollard can also be used as an adjective: &quot;pollard tree&quot;.

<doc id="99602" wikidata="Q3188107" url="?curid=99602" title="Jughead Jones">
<text>Forsythe Pendleton &quot;Jughead&quot; Jones III is one of the fictional characters created by Bob Montana and John L. Goldwater in Archie Comics who first appeared in the first Archie story, from &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #22 (December 1941). He is the drummer of the Archies and is a son of Forsythe Pendleton Jones II; in one of the early Archie newspaper comic strips, he is identified as John Jugworth Jones III (and in one strip, likely due to a continuity error, as Forsythe Van Jones). He has a white sheepdog named Hot Dog and a younger sister, Forsythia &quot;Jellybean&quot; Jones.

Jughead (shortened to Jug or Juggie) is the best friend of vocalist/guitarist Archie Andrews. Jughead is a smart, sharp-tongued, laid-back, and eccentric high school student. He is obsessed with eating food and in some storylines is asexual. Most see him as being lazy. He can be identified by his long nose, half-closed eyes, &quot;S&quot; sweatshirt, and whoopee cap (a crown-like warped and trimmed fedora hat). Jughead is portrayed by Cole Sprouse in the live-action CW series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, and Mihir Ahuja in &quot;The Archies&quot;.

==Concept and creation==
Bob Montana stated that Jughead was a character he imagined, unlike other characters in the series who were based on people he knew. Montana&#x27;s widow, Peg Bertholet, stated that high school friend of Montana&#x27;s named Skinny Linehan supposedly had some of Jughead&#x27;s peculiar traits. Bertholet has stated that the &quot;S&quot; insignia refers to a location called Skunk Hill in Haverhill, Massachusetts which Montana turned into Squirrel Hill. The &quot;S&quot; alludes to a combination of the location and Montana&#x27;s elementary school athletic team near Haverhill called the Tigers. Bertholet has stated that &quot;S&quot; stands for &quot;&#x27;Squirrel Hill Independent Tigers,&#x27; and you couldn&#x27;t abbreviate it any other way.&quot;

==History and character==
Jughead generally has a characteristic wry and sarcastic sense of humor. He is considered a bit of an oddity, but prefers his nonconformism as opposed to going along with others&#x27; styles. His many quirks make him the butt of teasing and abuse from Reggie, Veronica, and even other classmates and teachers. Many episodes involve Reggie and Jughead trying to outdo one another with pranks and bets, and Jughead almost always comes out the victor. He is revealed to be extremely clever and creative when necessary and he often takes advantage of Reggie&#x27;s and his other tormentors&#x27; weaknesses (and has fun all the while).

In the earlier comics, a running gag involved various characters trying to discover Jughead&#x27;s real name, while Jughead thwarted their efforts. In one story, Archie Andrews and Reggie Mantle go to the school office, where a woman tells them that Jughead&#x27;s real first name is Steve. After Archie and Reggie leave the office, the audience learns that the woman is actually Jughead&#x27;s aunt who has just lied as a favor to Jughead to help keep his real first name (Forsythe) hidden. The earliest stories indicated that the mention of his name drove girls wild for him. The first of these appeared in &quot;Jughead&quot; #159 (August 1968). In Little Archie #49 (September 1968), Miss Grundy revealed his real name at the start of class, and it drove girls wild. In a later story (issue #1 of &quot;The Jughead Jones Comics Digest&quot;, June 1977) we find out he is named after his ancestor, Forsythe P. Jones, who is an American hero. For a brief time, Jughead started to use his given name in honor of his ancestor. After learning that this ancestor was married nine times, Jughead reverted to his nickname.

Another mystery that follows Jughead&#x27;s character is the meaning of the &quot;S&quot; on his sweatshirt. This remains a mystery to this day, although many stories have hinted at a meaning. In Jughead #30 (1992), when his psychiatrist, Sara, asked him &quot;why an &#x27;S&#x27;?&quot; he replied &quot;I dunno! My third cousin was called skinny...&quot; The triangular banner on the cover of issue 140 of &quot;Archie &amp; Friends&quot; shows that the &quot;S&quot; stands for &quot;Silby&quot;, as in Silby High School, which he attended for a few months as a freshman. At one time after his sweater was filled with holes due to what he thought was a moth when it was actually a chemical accident caused in lab class, he reveals that he simply likes the letter S and finds it &quot;compatible&quot;, because the letter can stand for &quot;soup, sandwich, steak and all kinds of goodies!&quot; after his friends ask him. Betty rolls her eyes at the explanation and adds, &quot;S stands for &quot;sorry I asked&quot;!&quot; Another theory is that, as he is a non-conformist, he wears an &quot;S&quot; as opposed to his classmates who wear sweaters adorned with an &quot;R&quot; which stands for Riverdale.

=== Appetite and love for food===
Jughead is known for his love of food, especially hamburgers, and his ability to consume absurdly large quantities in a single sitting without getting sick or gaining weight, although he often sports a pot-belly immediately after a particularly large meal. Jughead is a preferred customer of most of Riverdale&#x27;s food establishments, especially Pop Tate&#x27;s Chock&#x27;lit Shoppe, except when he is behind on paying his usually lengthy tab. In one story, he was given a &quot;Restaurant Club Card&quot; and ate out at high-class restaurants until he found out how much interest the card charged, and Pop Tate loaned him the money on the condition that he eat exclusively at the Chock&#x27;lit Shoppe. His ability to eat so much food without gaining weight is attributed to a very rare and implausibly high metabolism . He once claimed that he weighed 300 pounds after a meal, although he is usually portrayed as slim and healthy.

Jughead&#x27;s special abilities concerning food extend to being able to identify food in a sealed can by smell, and being able to detect the slightest flaws in food preparation by taste. As such, he is a respected food critic, as well as a gourmet chef himself. One time, when he sought out Miss Grundy&#x27;s help with his creative writing, she suggested that he write about a subject he knew, leading to the &quot;Forsythe P. Jones Cookbook&quot;.

Jughead often participates in eating contests, usually winning outright, or else easily coming from behind after comic distractions, and often with room to spare while the competitor retires unwell. In a citywide eating contest, he ate a colossal burger made up of sixteen different burgers. Jughead also set two world records for eating pizza; one for speed-eating a pizza, and another for eating the most pizzas in one sitting: twelve. Jughead&#x27;s appetite is so large that even if he eats shortly before such contests, it does not affect his performance. For example, a rival high school once sent a girl, Jane Dough, to take Jughead to various restaurants and feed him as much as possible. Amazingly, Jughead still managed to win the contest. He explained to Jane that top athletes need to train constantly in order to stay in shape, and she actually helped him &quot;train&quot; for the contest.

One running gag depicts Jughead visiting restaurants that promise &quot;all you can eat&quot; special deals, with the devastated restaurateur closing down as Jughead leaves.

Despite his appetite, Jughead is not known to be stingy with food, or to let others go hungry. When a store selling penny candy opened in Riverdale, he spent his whole allowance on a huge bag of candy, only to meet a penniless young boy outside the shop. Jughead wrestled with his desire, but he chose to give the candy to the boy. In a similar story, Jughead met a homeless person who liked the same kind of pizza as he did, and decided to give him the pizza he had just purchased. In another story, after winning three pizzas a week for six months for being a pizzeria&#x27;s one-millionth customer, he donated them all to a soup kitchen where he volunteered.

Because of his well-known food obsession, Jughead was shown eating a hamburger on the facades of the short-lived Archie&#x27;s Family Restaurants.

===Jughead&#x27;s hat===
Jughead is almost always seen wearing his trademark beanie with both a round and square pin. This type of crown-shaped cap, called a whoopee cap, sometimes a &quot;Jughead cap&quot; or &quot;crown&quot;, was popular among boys in the 1930s and 1940s. It was made from a man&#x27;s felt fedora hat with the brim trimmed in a zig-zag and turned up. Bottle caps could be &quot;pinned&quot; in place using the cap&#x27;s removable cork lining. In the 1920s and 1930s, college freshmen were sometimes required to wear them for initiation purposes, and such caps were often worn by mechanics. Similar caps have appeared on other comic book/strip, cartoon, and children&#x27;s book characters such as Eddie Stimson in &quot;Little Lulu&quot;, Melvin Wisenheimer in &quot;Little Audrey&quot;, Skuzz in The Berenstain Bears, and Bugs Meany in &quot;Encyclopedia Brown&quot; as well as on Goober Pyle on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and Jeff Goldblum&#x27;s character &quot;Freak #1&quot; in &quot;Death Wish&quot;. Jughead&#x27;s hat was recolored in black in the Filmation cartoons and pink in &quot;The New Archies&quot;. Over the course of the character&#x27;s publication, Jughead&#x27;s hat has evolved from a modified fedora to its more recognisable &quot;crown&quot; appearance.

Though some view the hat as strange and immature, Jughead considers it a good luck charm and when it is taken from him, misfortune comes his way. While on the school baseball team, Jughead was pulled aside and reprimanded by school principal Mr. Weatherbee for wearing the hat instead of a proper baseball uniform cap. Jughead complied, but then started performing so badly that Weatherbee was forced to relent.

In the &quot;Time Police&quot; comic, there is a double of his beanie given to him by an unknown benefactor (later revealed to be himself) that allows him to travel in time.

Some stories showed him wear a unique pin on his hat which attracts many girls to him, so he hid it to avoid the crowd of girls rushing him.

The hat also seems to define part of Jughead&#x27;s personality. One story has the gang try to convince him to try a different hat, but it is revealed that whatever hat he tried on changed his personality to suit the hat. When they had him try on a detective hat, he focused on clues that would have gotten Archie in trouble with Betty and Veronica, and took a hair from Reggie&#x27;s sweater that implied that he sneaked a date with Midge behind Moose&#x27;s back (the look on both of their faces imply he was on to something). Jughead also stated that he felt naked without a hat. Finally, Veronica gave him a special hat to try on. When he did, everyone said it suited him (it was an ugly thing but looked comical. She said she was saving it for a Mad Hatter party). Jughead tried wearing it for a day at school, but scared several students, teachers, and even Miss Beazly the cafeteria lady) they begged him to go back to his trademark hat. When he asked what they&#x27;d do if he did, they offered him a platter of hamburgers and he happily agreed.

In Jughead and Friends Digest #25 story &quot;The Secret of Jughead&#x27;s Hat&quot; his cap is destroyed in a laundry accident. Wendy Weatherbee (Principal Weatherbee&#x27;s niece) replaces the lost hat by doing exactly as explained above when she takes an old fedora and cuts it and shapes it to remake the whoopee cap or crown.

===Family and friends===
Jughead&#x27;s best friend is Archie Andrews, despite their personality difference. Archie was the first person that Jughead met upon moving to Riverdale, and he is often dragged into Archie&#x27;s schemes and antics. Jughead is usually the first one to bail Archie out of trouble (though some times he only makes things worse). Jughead, extremely loyal, is willing to do almost anything to help his friend, something that Archie occasionally takes for granted.

Reggie Mantle is another one of Jughead&#x27;s close friends, though his and Jughead&#x27;s relationship is defined by their constant competition. Reggie never loses an opportunity to insult Jughead (&quot;needle-nose&quot; being his favorite nickname) and Jughead often responds with tricks to aggravate Reggie. Though it often appears they hate each other, and neither will admit otherwise, they really do care for one another. Jughead will even help Reggie escape being injured when Moose Mason is angry with him.

Alongside Archie, Betty Cooper frequently slips into the best friend role for Jughead in the comics. Their mutual love and appreciation for food (she cooks, he eats), and continuously going to bat for each other have made their friendship a stronghold in the comics. While generally disinterested in matters of the heart, Jughead frequently stands up for Betty when Archie breaks her heart. In one comic, Jughead tells Betty that if he were to ever kiss a girl willingly, it would be her.

Jughead and Veronica Lodge are constantly arguing. Veronica cannot stand his laid-back attitude witticisms, and Jughead enjoys teasing her and making her lose her temper with clever insults. Their relationship would be considered that of &quot;frenemies&quot;. Although at times, he relishes causing her to get angry because sometimes he sees her as an uncaring selfish snob. He once told Veronica he was &quot;mad with passion&quot; for her, and began popping up wherever she went, to get her off his back after she criticized him publicly. They were once cast together in a school play, which required them to kiss. Due to the way Jughead kissed her, she was caught up in the moment and fell in love with him for a while. However, Jughead managed to get her over her crush, with the help of a garlic and onion sandwich.

Jughead&#x27;s other friends include Dilton Doiley and Moose Mason. Other than Dilton, Jughead probably gets along with Moose better than the other boys because of his non-confrontational attitude (and his lack of interest in Moose&#x27;s girlfriend Midge). Jughead&#x27;s nerdy ways and lack of interest in sports and girls probably account for how well he gets along with Dilton.

Jughead&#x27;s family includes his father, also named Forsythe, his mother Gladys, and in later comics, his younger sister Jellybean. He also has many eccentric relatives including slightly-addled Uncle Herman, or &quot;Doc Jones&quot;, a daffy and slightly pompous inventor whose creations usually wreak havoc on Jughead and/or his friends and his lookalike younger cousin, Souphead. Other one-time relatives appear frequently. Jughead also tells many stories of his ancestors, who prove to be quite as interesting as himself. A 1970s &quot;Archie&quot; cartoon episode featured Jughead&#x27;s paternal grandparents—&quot;both&quot; of whom resemble Jughead.

Another acquaintance of Jughead&#x27;s is Trula Twyst, Riverdale High&#x27;s budding pop psychologist, who is constantly trying to analyze Jughead to determine what makes him so odd. The two share a strange love/hate relationship that would have gone much smoother had they not met the way they did- Trula tricked Jughead into dating her in order to become more popular.

In one story, Jughead claimed his great-grandmother was a Native American &quot;from the Pawtuxet tribe&quot;, despite the fact that the Patuxet were killed off by 1622. In another story from the same era, he claimed his great-great-grandfather was &quot;an eskimo&quot;, who was &quot;the only cop north of Nome...&#x27;Ol&#x27; Bluenose Jones&#x27; they called him!&quot; It is likely that neither of these claims are meant to be taken seriously. In both stories he also used his claims to make fun of Veronica, which suggests more that his comments were meant as jokes, since Jughead has a history of making up fibs to tease Veronica and other opponents.

In the &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; universe, Jughead&#x27;s doppelgänger is nicknamed Bottleneck. Bottleneck wears a beanie that resembles a broken bottleneck. His best friend (and fellow juvenile delinquent) is Starchie.

===Miniseries===
&quot;Jughead&#x27;s Time Police&quot; was a series that began in 1990 featuring Jughead as a hero of the 29th century and a member of the Time Police, an organization that ensures history to remain the same for the future&#x27;s sake. In this series, the beanie gives Jughead the ability to time travel by thinking. With his supervisor, Marshal January McAndrews, Jughead repairs disturbances in the past. The series was rebooted in 2019, with Jughead building a time machine to undo the mistakes he has made, forcing January McAndrews to intervene.

Other spin-offs include &quot;Jughead&#x27;s Diner&quot; in 1990, where he ran a diner with an eclectic cast of patrons; and &quot;Jughead&#x27;s Fantasy&quot;, resulting from &quot;Jughead&#x27;s Folly&quot;, lasted for three issues and featured Jughead&#x27;s dreams of various alter-egos, including &quot;Sir Jugalot&quot;, &quot;Peter Goon--Private Eye&quot;, and &quot;Son of Hercules&quot;. Jughead also featured in &quot;Explorers of the Unknown&quot;, playing Squint, a daredevil escape artist.

==Sexuality==
Jughead is known for his lack of interest in romantic relationships with anyone. Jughead&#x27;s philosophy on romantic relationships, gained from observing Archie&#x27;s romantic entanglements, is that dating makes life complicated and costs money that could be spent on hamburgers. Ironically, his apathy toward women often attracts rather than repels them. His most ardent admirer is Ethel Muggs, an awkward but very friendly girl who chases after Jughead at every opportunity, despite Jughead&#x27;s constant and blunt refusals. Later story-lines showed a decrease in her obsession with him, and even show her dating other guys, making Jughead jealous. Jughead secretly enjoys the attention, although he claims that he puts up with Ethel&#x27;s company only because she cooks for him. He has shown romantic interest in her on rare occasions, and eventually falls in love with her in the &quot;Life With Archie: The Married Life&quot; series, where the &quot;Archie Marries Veronica&quot; stories end with Jughead and Ethel&#x27;s wedding.

In 2016, Jughead&#x27;s orientation was confirmed to be asexual in the stories of Chip Zdarsky (and later Ryan North and Mark Waid) for the &quot;Jughead&quot; comics as part of the &quot;New Riverdale&quot; line. Zdarsky said of his run on the book that &quot;the next writer could make him discover girls or boys or both and that&#x27;s totally fine. There have been iterations of Jughead over the decades where he has been interested in girls, so there&#x27;s room to play around if someone was inclined. For me though, I like an asexual Jughead.&quot; He later tweeted that he viewed Jughead as &quot;ace and probably demi-romantic, but for the purposes of his teen years, aro.&quot; Both &quot;Riverdale&quot; fans in the asexual community and Cole Sprouse, who portrays Jughead in The CW&#x27;s &quot;Riverdale&quot;, have complained of asexual erasure in mainstream television and expressed desire to see the character&#x27;s asexuality explored. However, Sprouse later noted that the Jughead Zdarsky created is the only asexual version so far. At the same time, he said that Jughead is aromantic in the classic Archie stories, &quot;a different thing [from asexuality] but deserves attention as well.&quot;

A group of girls formed the UGAJ (United Girls Against Jughead) in an effort to get him interested in romance, using methods such as computers or food, though ultimately failing.

For his first 40 years or so of the comic, Jughead often claimed to dislike girls, but a shift in societal attitudes has caused later writers and fans to try different ways of explaining this, such as past heartbreak from childhood romance, bad impressions from Veronica and Ethel, and in the 2015 reboot, asexuality. There has never been one consistent canon explanation for Jughead&#x27;s avoidance of girls and dating. In one story, Jughead declares, &quot;I don&#x27;t hate girls—I just love food more!&quot; In the story &quot;Phood Phobia&quot;, Archie and Dilton Doiley discover a hidden layer to this: it turns out that Jughead is actually nervous around girls, and he turns to food for comfort. When confronted with this, Jughead is stunned; finding out that girls are the reason he enjoys food so much makes him lose his appetite. In another story, when Jughead saw that Miss Grundy was upset on her birthday, he rallied the other students to cheer her up.

In &quot;A Lass From The Past&quot;, written by Nate Butler and first appearing in &quot;Jughead&quot; #5 (April 1988), Jughead explains the reason he does not chase after girls is because of a childhood heartbreak, sustained before he moved to Riverdale. Little Jughead befriended Joani and they had a puppy love relationship. Jughead&#x27;s family moved to Riverdale and he had to leave Joani behind. Determined to not endure heartbreak again, he swore off girls, keeping little Joani&#x27;s picture in his wallet as a reminder. That changed when Debbie moved to town (in &quot;Jughead&#x27;s Journal&quot;, written by Rod Ollerenshaw and also first appearing in Jughead #5), and Jughead began to overcome his old heartbreak as they started dating. However, Joani suddenly visits town. Now a young woman, she tells Jughead that she never forgot him and still has a crush on him, and they share their first kiss. Before Jughead decides whether he wants to pursue a relationship with Joani, she leaves him, but with a promise that they will be together again. The comic even had Jughead say, &quot;Sometimes, life is just more interesting than burgers and shakes.&quot; For a while, Debbie and Joani formed Jughead&#x27;s own love triangle, but fans did not like it, so both girls disappeared and Jughead reverted to his classic independent lifestyle. A few years later, a girl named Trula Twyst appeared. She tends to drive Jughead crazy with her ability to predict his next moves, and they developed a love-hate relationship.

Another thread that has run through stories involves a psychic experience he is supposed to have had, caused by an odd pin he wears on his hat. In the early 1990s, Jughead had three girlfriends: Debbie, Joani, and January McAndrews. The latter is Archie&#x27;s descendant in the future, who starred with Jughead in Jughead&#x27;s Time Police, a short-lived spinoff comic about their adventures traveling through time.

==Musical interests==
Jughead was the drummer for The Archies. In one four-part story, which included many flashbacks of Jughead&#x27;s life, Archie had commented that the reason he&#x27;d chosen the position of drummer was that he was too introverted to play at the front of the stage. Another reason was that he could put food in his drums to eat while he played.

He has also professed a love for jazz music, once detailed in an issue of &quot;Jughead Magazine&quot; where he develops an obsession with an obscure jazz drummer named &quot;Crazy&quot; Willie Jim. After collecting his records, Jughead finally met Jim, who was now very old, ailing and reclusive, playing on a street corner. Jughead convinced Jim that he was trustworthy and they became fast friends. Jim even played with The Archies at one of their gigs. Jim died very soon after, so Jughead sat in with Jim&#x27;s friends on the corner to play one last, mournful version of &quot;St. James Infirmary Blues&quot;.

==Special abilities==
In spite of his reputation as slow and lazy, Jughead is frequently shown to be extremely intelligent, and often surprises his skeptical friends (notably Reggie Mantle and Veronica Lodge) with his vast knowledge on a wide variety of subjects, including history, Shakespeare, sports, and science. In several issues, Jughead has demonstrated that his IQ is well above average. He is an extremely good student, which exasperates his teachers when he sometimes pays them no attention.

His intelligence varies from story to story. In many cases, he has trouble keeping decent grades, but was once given an award for being the best student in the school. Once, in Little Archie, it was revealed that as a student, Jughead was second only to Dilton Doiley. His intelligence is displayed by his sharp wit, the occasional deep insight, and the odd chance he gets to upstage or outsmart Reggie Mantle. In one issue, Mr. Weatherbee tries to cut down on Jughead&#x27;s food consumption, only to realize that Jughead&#x27;s brain stops functioning without massive amounts of food. Professor Flutesnoot implies that Jughead&#x27;s brain burns all the calories, which keeps him thin.

Jughead is also a talented artist, and refers to his works as his &quot;Dipsy Doodles&quot;, which feature in one-page comic strips. Often, what he paints comes to life or becomes a real, three-dimensional object. Another recurring gag, featured in the 1960s, was &quot;Professor Jughead&quot;, where he would wear a gown and mortarboard and lecture to his fellow teenagers about subjects he considered relevant. However, the content of the lesson was often nonsensical and useless in real life. &quot;Professor Jughead&#x27;s Loony Laws&quot; was a strip in which he presented various dumb laws. One strip explores the fact that Jughead is seldom drawn with his eyes open by noting that Jughead has the unusual ability to &quot;see&quot; with his eyes completely shut, and not see with them open.

In his spare time, he enjoys playing video games, reading comic books, and skateboarding. It was also noted in one issue that he has an interest in Japanese anime and manga as well, with titles such as Sailor Lunar, Dragon Tall 33, Tech Robo, and Tragic Knight Sayearth. In the late 1980s, Jughead became obsessed with the skateboarding subculture, and his interests and taste in fashion were revamped to fit this. A number of short-lived characters were added to the &quot;Jughead&quot; comics, including his paraplegic African-American crush Anita; blind rival for Ethel&#x27;s affections Jeff and his guide dog Spike; and heavy metal band The Potholes. However, this makeover only lasted for a few years.

Jughead rarely takes an interest in sports, but has a few unexpected athletic talents. These are often side effects of his other activities. For example, he is a very fast runner due to his constant evasion of Ethel and his determination to be at the front of the lunchline every day. Coach Kleats often tries to recruit him for various school teams, usually without longterm success. Over the years, he has been seen as a basketball player, baseball pitcher, martial artist, swimmer, dancer and gymnast.

Many stories revolve around other characters making comments about Jughead&#x27;s appetite. One story has Dilton Doiley making calculations to scientifically prove that it&#x27;s impossible for Jughead to eat the way that he does, and even convinces Pop Tate to cook everything Jughead ate earlier to prove it. When the entire gang isn&#x27;t paying attention, Jughead ate all the food and ended the story by saying that if they didn&#x27;t believe it they could make the food and he&#x27;d eat it again. Another story has Jughead going against a guy from another group in an eating contest. The rival gang sends a girl to feed Jughead to fill him up the night before in an effort to cheat but he manages to win anyway. In still another, Archie expresses concern over Jughead&#x27;s eating and lack of exercise, which prompts Reggie to show off lifting a single crate of Pop&#x27;s bottles over his head. Jughead helps Pop by effortlessly lifting three crates at once and carrying them to the back room, stunning Archie and Reggie. Unnerving them even more, he rips out a stool that Pop said he could take for a souvenir (he was replacing his counter stools later that day) with one hand again with no effort. In that story, he says he eats to get strong, cracking up Archie and Reggie, but they change their mind when they see he&#x27;s very strong, and even take up eating in an effort to get strong, with no success.

Often, when Jughead attempts to join a team, he ends up with an undesirable menial task, such as water-boy or equipment manager. However, he often takes part in less strenuous school activities, such as the school newspaper, &quot;the Blue and Gold&quot;. His reputation as a food critic and his unbiased views of the school teams make him a valuable member of the staff. In some stories, Jughead has been shown to have supernatural abilities that are never seen again. These include controlling weather, giving the evil-eye, learning the skills presented in any book he reads, and predicting the future.

In the &quot;Super Teens&quot; stories (where several of the main &quot;Archie&quot; characters are secretly superheroes), Jughead could become Captain Hero, gaining a caped costume and more muscular physique (varying from story to story), but retaining his crown-shaped cap. Captain Hero appeared when Jughead recites the magic incantation (similar to Green Lantern&#x27;s oath):

&quot;Teeny weeny magic beanie pointing towards the sky; give me muscle, power, vigor - form a super guy!&quot;

Captain Hero often seemed to possess just the right powers for the problem at hand. These were never completely defined, but he maintained certain &quot;stock&quot; superhuman powers, such as flight, enhanced strength and resistance to injury. Early on, Captain Hero was often the most serious and competent of the Super Teens, and the others would defer to his leadership, in contrast to Jughead&#x27;s perceived status as Archie&#x27;s sidekick and a generally lazy individual.

==Hot Dog==

Hot Dog is a long-haired mutt who resembles a white Old English Sheepdog. He belongs to Jughead, although when he first appeared in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #224 (December 1968), he belonged to Archie. Hot Dog switched owners frequently in his early appearances, but was eventually given a permanent home with Jughead.

Hot Dog usually thinks like a human, in that his thoughts are presented in thought bubbles. He is lazy, constantly hungry, and, much like Jughead, has a dislike for Reggie Mantle.

Hot Dog is usually considered a member of Archie&#x27;s Gang. He tends to be attracted to Veronica Lodge&#x27;s pedigreed dogs, and even had a litter of puppies with one of them, a poodle named Lucretia, much to Veronica&#x27;s chagrin. In the 1970s series &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, Hot Dog has a sidekick, Chili Dog, who is smaller and red-haired. A running gag is the two dogs&#x27; &quot;battles&quot; with Sabrina&#x27;s cat Salem Saberhagen. In the alternate universe limited series &quot;Jughead&#x27;s Pal, Hot Dog&quot;, when Jughead&#x27;s family objects to Hot Dog living indoors because he is covered in dirt, Dilton Doiley builds Hot Dog a doghouse full of whimsical inventions. Hot Dog&#x27;s sidekick in that short-lived series is a chihuahua named Pablito.

=== In other media ===
In the Filmation animated series &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, Hot Dog is the mascot for The Archies and is often portrayed as pretending to &quot;conduct&quot; the band.

Hot Dog appears in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot;, once again as Jughead&#x27;s dog. In this continuity, however, Jughead is shown to own multiple pets, so he isn&#x27;t seen very often. Sometimes, Hot Dog is affected by the surreal occurrences that plague Riverdale. For instance, in the episode &quot;Twisted Youth&quot;, he is transformed back into a puppy as a result of drinking some age-reversing water.

==Other versions==

===&quot;Life with Archie: The Married Life&quot;===
Jughead appears in the 2010 &quot;Life with Archie: The Married Life&quot;. In this series, Jughead has taken over Pop&#x27;s from Pop Tate and has renamed it Jughead&#x27;s, which later spanned a franchise in each respective universe. He ended up abandoning the franchise to operate the original shoppe in Riverdale. In this series, he ends up marrying Midge Klump in one universe, and Ethel in the other.

===&quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot;===
Jughead appears in the first issue of 2013&#x27;s &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot; before being bitten by a resurrected Hot Dog, which transforms him into a zombie. He is referred to as &quot;Patient Zero&quot; in terms of being the first one affected. However, the eighth issue reveals that Jughead is a ghost and his soul is no longer in his body; whatever is controlling his corpse isn&#x27;t him.

===&quot;Jughead: The Hunger&quot;===
In this 2017 Archie Horror spin-off, Jughead is a werewolf responsible for a number of murders in Riverdale and becomes known as &quot;The Riverdale Ripper&quot;. He and Archie realize he&#x27;s a werewolf after he murders Dilton during a full moon. The next day, Betty reveals that he comes from a long line of lycanthropes dating back to medieval England and that her ancestors have always been there to stop them. Not wanting Betty to murder his friend, Archie suggests going to the botanical gardens to cure Jughead with Wolfsbane. This works for a couple of months, but after it wears off and Jughead murders Reggie in his wolf state, he leaves town with Hot Dog as he knows Betty wouldn&#x27;t give him a second chance.

===Live-action===

* Derrel Maury played Jughead in &quot;Archie&quot;, a 1976 episode of the &quot;ABC Saturday Comedy Special&quot;; this was intended to be the pilot for a new series, which never materialized. He reprised this role in the 1978 TV-movie &quot;The Archie Situation Comedy Musical Variety Show&quot;.
* Jughead appears in &quot;&quot;, a 1990 TV movie which was broadcast on NBC, portrayed by Sam Whipple. Set fifteen years after his graduation from high school, the movie depicts Jughead as a psychiatrist who owns a successful private practice outside of Riverdale. He is also divorced and raising his young son Jordon on his own, who Archie jokingly refers to as Jughead Junior.
* Jughead appears in &quot;Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.&quot;, a 1990 parody superhero comedy film created by Troma Entertainment, portrayed by Brick Bronsky.
* Jughead is a main character in &quot;Riverdale&quot;, a drama series on The CW, where he is portrayed by Cole Sprouse. This version of Jughead is markedly different from the comic character, exhibiting a darker, moodier demeanor and is not overly obsessed with food, eating normally like most people. In the show, Jughead wears an ordinary dark gray knitted hat with points and pins, but appears in a dream sequence wearing his distinctive crown cap and &quot;S&quot; sweatshirt. His mother and sister are mentioned but absent (until Season 3), having left for Toledo due to his father&#x27;s drinking. His father, F.P., is leader of the Southside Serpents, and Jughead, choosing not to live with him, is homeless. In the first-season finale, the Serpents offer Jughead one of their jackets, essentially making him an honorary member. In the second season, he undergoes an initiation that includes a brutal beating to become a full-fledged member. Over time, he becomes a de facto leader of the teenagers in the gang, and in the second-season finale, after he attempts to save the Serpents from a fight with a rival gang that badly outnumbers them by trading himself, F.P. retires and names him as his successor.

<text>Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon content (less than 0.05%) in contrast to that of cast iron (2.1% to 4.5%). It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions (up to 2% by weight), which give it a wood-like &quot;grain&quot; that is visible when it is etched, rusted, or bent to failure. Wrought iron is tough, malleable, ductile, corrosion resistant, and easily forge welded, but is more difficult to weld electrically.

Before the development of effective methods of steelmaking and the availability of large quantities of steel, wrought iron was the most common form of malleable iron. It was given the name &quot;wrought&quot; because it was hammered, rolled, or otherwise worked while hot enough to expel molten slag. The modern functional equivalent of wrought iron is mild steel, also called low-carbon steel. Neither wrought iron nor mild steel contain enough carbon to be hardened by heating and quenching.

Wrought iron is highly refined, with a small amount of silicate slag forged out into fibers. It comprises around 99.4% iron by mass. The presence of slag can be beneficial for blacksmithing operations, such as forge welding, since the silicate inclusions act as a flux and give the material its unique, fibrous structure. The silicate filaments in the slag also protect the iron from corrosion and diminish the effect of fatigue caused by shock and vibration.

Historically, a modest amount of wrought iron was refined into steel, which was used mainly to produce swords, cutlery, chisels, axes, and other edged tools, as well as springs and files. The demand for wrought iron reached its peak in the 1860s, being in high demand for ironclad warships and railway use. However, as properties such as brittleness of mild steel improved with better ferrous metallurgy and as steel became less costly to make thanks to the Bessemer process and the Siemens–Martin process, the use of wrought iron declined.

Many items, before they came to be made of mild steel, were produced from wrought iron, including rivets, nails, wire, chains, rails, railway couplings, water and steam pipes, nuts, bolts, horseshoes, handrails, wagon tires, straps for timber roof trusses, and ornamental ironwork, among many other things.

Wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale. Many products described as wrought iron, such as guard rails, garden furniture, and gates are made of mild steel. They are described as &quot;wrought iron&quot; only because they have been made to resemble objects which in the past were wrought (worked) by hand by a blacksmith (although many decorative iron objects, including fences and gates, were often cast rather than wrought).

==Terminology==
The word &quot;wrought&quot; is an archaic past participle of the verb &quot;to work&quot;, and so &quot;wrought iron&quot; literally means &quot;worked iron&quot;. Wrought iron is a general term for the commodity, but is also used more specifically for finished iron goods, as manufactured by a blacksmith. It was used in that narrower sense in British Customs records, such manufactured iron was subject to a higher rate of duty than what might be called &quot;unwrought&quot; iron. Cast iron, unlike wrought iron, is brittle and cannot be worked either hot or cold.

In the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, wrought iron went by a wide variety of terms according to its form, origin, or quality.

While the bloomery process produced wrought iron directly from ore, cast iron or pig iron were the starting materials used in the finery forge and puddling furnace. Pig iron and cast iron have higher carbon content than wrought iron, but have a lower melting point than iron or steel. Cast and especially pig iron have excess slag which must be at least partially removed to produce quality wrought iron. At foundries it was common to blend scrap wrought iron with cast iron to improve the physical properties of castings.

For several years after the introduction of Bessemer and open hearth steel, there were different opinions as to what differentiated iron from steel; some believed it was the chemical composition and others that it was whether the iron heated sufficiently to melt and &quot;fuse&quot;. Fusion eventually became generally accepted as relatively more important than composition below a given low carbon concentration. Another difference is that steel can be hardened by heat treating.

Historically, wrought iron was known as &quot;commercially pure iron&quot;; however, it no longer qualifies because current standards for commercially pure iron require a carbon content of less than 0.008 wt%.

===Types and shapes===
Bar iron is a generic term sometimes used to distinguish it from cast iron. It is the equivalent of an ingot of cast metal, in a convenient form for handling, storage, shipping and further working into a finished product.

The bars were the usual product of the finery forge, but not necessarily made by that process:
* Rod iron—cut from flat bar iron in a slitting mill provided the raw material for spikes and nails.
* Hoop iron—suitable for the hoops of barrels, made by passing rod iron through rolling dies.
* Plate iron—sheets suitable for use as boiler plate.
* Blackplate—sheets, perhaps thinner than plate iron, from the black rolling stage of tinplate production.
* Voyage iron—narrow flat bar iron, made or cut into bars of a particular weight, a commodity for sale in Africa for the Atlantic slave trade. The number of bars per ton gradually increased from 70 per ton in the 1660s to 75–80 per ton in 1685 and &quot;near 92 to the ton&quot; in 1731.

===Origin===
* Charcoal iron—until the end of the 18th century, wrought iron was smelted from ore using charcoal, by the bloomery process. Wrought iron was also produced from pig iron using a finery forge or in a Lancashire hearth. The resulting metal was highly variable, both in chemistry and slag content.
* Puddled iron—the puddling process was the first large-scale process to produce wrought iron. In the puddling process, pig iron is refined in a reverberatory furnace to prevent contamination of the iron from the sulfur in the coal or coke. The molten pig iron is manually stirred, exposing the iron to atmospheric oxygen, which decarburizes the iron. As the iron is stirred, globs of wrought iron are collected into balls by the stirring rod (rabble arm or rod) and those are periodically removed by the puddler. Puddling was patented in 1784 and became widely used after 1800. By 1876, annual production of puddled iron in the UK alone was over 4 million tons. Around that time, the open hearth furnace was able to produce steel of suitable quality for structural purposes, and wrought iron production went into decline.
* Oregrounds iron—a particularly pure grade of bar iron made ultimately from iron ore from the Dannemora mine in Sweden. Its most important use was as the raw material for the cementation process of steelmaking.
* Danks iron—originally iron imported to Great Britain from Gdańsk, but in the 18th century more probably the kind of iron (from eastern Sweden) that once came from Gdańsk.
* Forest iron—iron from the English Forest of Dean, where haematite ore enabled tough iron to be produced.
* Lukes iron—iron imported from Liège, whose Dutch name is &quot;Luik&quot;.
* Ames iron or amys iron—another variety of iron imported to England from northern Europe. Its origin has been suggested to be Amiens, but it seems to have been imported from Flanders in the 15th century and Holland later, suggesting an origin in the Rhine valley. Its origins remain controversial.
* Botolf iron or Boutall iron—from Bytów (Polish Pomerania) or Bytom (Polish Silesia).
* Sable iron (or Old Sable)—iron bearing the mark (a sable) of the Demidov family of Russian ironmasters, one of the better brands of Russian iron.

===Quality===
;Tough iron: Also spelled &quot;tuf&quot;, is not brittle and is strong enough to be used for tools.
;Blend iron: Made using a mixture of different types of pig iron.
;Best iron: Iron put through several stages of piling and rolling to reach the stage regarded (in the 19th century) as the best quality.
;Marked bar iron: Made by members of the Marked Bar Association and marked with the maker&#x27;s brand mark as a sign of its quality.

===Defects===
Wrought iron is a form of commercial iron containing less than 0.10% of carbon, less than 0.25% of impurities total of sulfur, phosphorus, silicon and manganese, and less than 2% slag by weight.

Wrought iron is &quot;redshort&quot; or &quot;hot short&quot; if it contains sulfur in excess quantity. It has sufficient tenacity when cold, but cracks when bent or finished at a red heat. Hot short iron was considered unmarketable.

&quot;Cold short&quot; iron, also known as &quot;coldshear&quot;, &quot;colshire&quot;, contains excessive phosphorus. It is very brittle when cold and cracks if bent. It may, however, be worked at high temperature. Historically, coldshort iron was considered sufficient for nails.

Phosphorus is not necessarily detrimental to iron. Ancient Near Eastern smiths did not add lime to their furnaces. The absence of calcium oxide in the slag, and the deliberate use of wood with high phosphorus content during the smelting, induces a higher phosphorus content (typically &lt;0.3%) than in modern iron (&lt;0.02–0.03%). Analysis of the Iron Pillar of Delhi gives 0.11% in the iron. The included slag in wrought iron also imparts corrosion resistance.

Antique music wire, manufactured at a time when mass-produced carbon-steels were available, was found to have low carbon and high phosphorus; iron with high phosphorus content, normally causing brittleness when worked cold, was easily drawn into music wires. Although at the time phosphorus was not an easily identified component of iron, it was hypothesized that the type of iron had been rejected for conversion to steel but excelled when tested for drawing ability.

==History==
===China===
During the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), new iron smelting processes led to the manufacture of new wrought iron implements for use in agriculture, such as the multi-tube seed drill and iron plough. In addition to accidental lumps of low-carbon wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in ancient Chinese cupola furnaces. The ancient Chinese created wrought iron by using the finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han dynasty site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), due to the fact that there are wrought iron items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the bloomery ever being used in China. The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in addition to the Han dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictorial evidence of the fining hearth from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text &quot;Taiping Jing&quot;.

===Western world===
Wrought iron has been used for many centuries, and is the &quot;iron&quot; that is referred to throughout Western history. The other form of iron, cast iron, was in use in China since ancient times but was not introduced into Western Europe until the 15th century; even then, due to its brittleness, it could be used for only a limited number of purposes. Throughout much of the Middle Ages, iron was produced by the direct reduction of ore in manually operated bloomeries, although water power had begun to be employed by 1104.

The raw material produced by all indirect processes is pig iron. It has a high carbon content and as a consequence, it is brittle and cannot be used to make hardware. The osmond process was the first of the indirect processes, developed by 1203, but bloomery production continued in many places. The process depended on the development of the blast furnace, of which medieval examples have been discovered at Lapphyttan, Sweden and in Germany.

The bloomery and osmond processes were gradually replaced from the 15th century by finery processes, of which there were two versions, the German and Walloon. They were in turn replaced from the late 18th century by puddling, with certain variants such as the Swedish Lancashire process. Those, too, are now obsolete, and wrought iron is no longer manufactured commercially.

===Bloomery process===
Wrought iron was originally produced by a variety of smelting processes, all described today as &quot;bloomeries&quot;. Different forms of bloomery were used at different places and times. The bloomery was charged with charcoal and iron ore and then lit. Air was blown in through a tuyere to heat the bloomery to a temperature somewhat below the melting point of iron. In the course of the smelt, slag would melt and run out, and carbon monoxide from the charcoal would reduce the ore to iron, which formed a spongy mass (called a &quot;bloom&quot;) containing iron and also molten silicate minerals (slag) from the ore. The iron remained in the solid state. If the bloomery were allowed to become hot enough to melt the iron, carbon would dissolve into it and form pig or cast iron, but that was not the intention. However, the design of a bloomery made it difficult to reach the melting point of iron and also prevented the concentration of carbon monoxide from becoming high.

After smelting was complete, the bloom was removed, and the process could then be started again. It was thus a batch process, rather than a continuous one such as a blast furnace. The bloom had to be forged mechanically to consolidate it and shape it into a bar, expelling slag in the process.

During the Middle Ages, water-power was applied to the process, probably initially for powering bellows, and only later to hammers for forging the blooms. However, while it is certain that water-power was used, the details remain uncertain. That was the culmination of the direct process of ironmaking. It survived in Spain and southern France as Catalan Forges to the mid 19th century, in Austria as the &quot;stuckofen&quot; to 1775, and near Garstang in England until about 1770; it was still in use with hot blast in New York in the 1880s. In Japan the last of the old &quot;tatara&quot; bloomeries used in production of traditional tamahagane steel, mainly used in swordmaking, was extinguished only in 1925, though in the late 20th century the production resumed on a low scale to supply the steel to the artisan swordmakers.

===Osmond process===
Osmond iron consisted of balls of wrought iron, produced by melting pig iron and catching the droplets on a staff, which was spun in front of a blast of air so as to expose as much of it as possible to the air and oxidise its carbon content. The resultant ball was often forged into bar iron in a hammer mill.

===Finery process===
In the 15th century, the blast furnace spread into what is now Belgium where it was improved. From there, it spread via the Pays de Bray on the boundary of Normandy and then to the Weald in England. With it, the finery forge spread. Those remelted the pig iron and (in effect) burnt out the carbon, producing a bloom, which was then forged into bar iron. If rod iron was required, a slitting mill was used.

The finery process existed in two slightly different forms. In Great Britain, France, and parts of Sweden, only the Walloon process was used. That employed two different hearths, a finery hearth for finishing the iron and a chafery hearth for reheating it in the course of drawing the bloom out into a bar. The finery always burnt charcoal, but the chafery could be fired with mineral coal, since its impurities would not harm the iron when it was in the solid state. On the other hand, the German process, used in Germany, Russia, and most of Sweden used a single hearth for all stages.

The introduction of coke for use in the blast furnace by Abraham Darby in 1709 (or perhaps others a little earlier) initially had little effect on wrought iron production. Only in the 1750s was coke pig iron used on any significant scale as the feedstock of finery forges. However, charcoal continued to be the fuel for the finery.

===Potting and stamping===

From the late 1750s, ironmasters began to develop processes for making bar iron without charcoal. There were a number of patented processes for that, which are referred to today as potting and stamping. The earliest were developed by John Wood of Wednesbury and his brother Charles Wood of Low Mill at Egremont, patented in 1763. Another was developed for the Coalbrookdale Company by the Cranage brothers. Another important one was that of John Wright and Joseph Jesson of West Bromwich.

===Puddling process===

A number of processes for making wrought iron without charcoal were devised as the Industrial Revolution began during the latter half of the 18th century. The most successful of those was puddling, using a puddling furnace (a variety of the reverberatory furnace), which was invented by Henry Cort in 1784. It was later improved by others including Joseph Hall, who was the first to add iron oxide to the charge. In that type of furnace, the metal does not come into contact with the fuel, and so is not contaminated by its impurities. The heat of the combustion products passes over the surface of the puddle and the roof of the furnace reverberates (reflects) the heat onto the metal puddle on the fire bridge of the furnace.

Unless the raw material used is white cast iron, the pig iron or other raw product of the puddling first had to be refined into refined iron, or finers metal. That would be done in a refinery where raw coal was used to remove silicon and convert carbon within the raw material, found in the form of graphite, to a combination with iron called cementite.

In the fully developed process (of Hall), this metal was placed into the hearth of the puddling furnace where it was melted. The hearth was lined with oxidizing agents such as haematite and iron oxide. The mixture was subjected to a strong current of air and stirred with long bars, called puddling bars or rabbles, through working doors. The air, the stirring, and the &quot;boiling&quot; action of the metal helped the oxidizing agents to oxidize the impurities and carbon out of the pig iron. As the impurities oxidize, they formed a molten slag or drifted off as gas, while the remaining iron solidified into spongy wrought iron that floated to the top of the puddle and was fished out of the melt as puddle balls, using puddle bars.

====Shingling====
There was still some slag left in the puddle balls, so while they were still hot they would be shingled to remove the remaining slag and cinder. That was achieved by forging the balls under a hammer, or by squeezing the bloom in a machine. The material obtained at the end of shingling is known as bloom. The blooms are not useful in that form, so they were rolled into a final product.

Sometimes European ironworks would skip the shingling process completely and roll the puddle balls. The only drawback to that is that the edges of the rough bars were not as well compressed. When the rough bar was reheated, the edges might separate and be lost into the furnace.

====Rolling====
The bloom was passed through rollers and to produce bars. The bars of wrought iron were of poor quality, called muck bars or puddle bars. To improve their quality, the bars were cut up, piled and tied together by wires, a process known as faggoting or piling. They were then reheated to a welding state, forge welded, and rolled again into bars. The process could be repeated several times to produce wrought iron of desired quality. Wrought iron that has been rolled multiple times is called merchant bar or merchant iron.

===Lancashire process===
The advantage of puddling was that it used coal, not charcoal as fuel. However, that was of little advantage in Sweden, which lacked coal. Gustaf Ekman observed charcoal fineries at Ulverston, which were quite different from any in Sweden. After his return to Sweden in the 1830s, he experimented and developed a process similar to puddling but used firewood and charcoal, which was widely adopted in the Bergslagen in the following decades.

===Aston process===
In 1925, James Aston of the United States developed a process for manufacturing wrought iron quickly and economically. It involved taking molten steel from a Bessemer converter and pouring it into cooler liquid slag. The temperature of the steel is about 1500 °C and the liquid slag is maintained at approximately 1200 °C. The molten steel contains a large amount of dissolved gases so when the liquid steel hit the cooler surfaces of the liquid slag the gases were liberated. The molten steel then froze to yield a spongy mass having a temperature of about 1370 °C. The spongy mass would then be finished by being shingled and rolled as described under puddling (above). Three to four tons could be converted per batch with the method.

===Decline===
Steel began to replace iron for railroad rails as soon as the Bessemer process for its manufacture was adopted (1865 on). Iron remained dominant for structural applications until the 1880s, because of problems with brittle steel, caused by introduced nitrogen, high carbon, excess phosphorus, or excessive temperature during or too-rapid rolling. By 1890 steel had largely replaced iron for structural applications.

Sheet iron (Armco 99.97% pure iron) had good properties for use in appliances, being well-suited for enamelling and welding, and being rust-resistant.

In the 1960s, the price of steel production was dropping due to recycling, and even using the Aston process, wrought iron production was labor-intensive. It has been estimated that the production of wrought iron is approximately twice as expensive as that of low-carbon steel. In the United States, the last plant closed in 1969. The last in the world was the Atlas Forge of Thomas Walmsley and Sons in Bolton, Great Britain, which closed in 1973. Its 1860s-era equipment was moved to the Blists Hill site of Ironbridge Gorge Museum for preservation. Some wrought iron is still being produced for heritage restoration purposes, but only by recycling scrap.

==Properties==
The slag inclusions, or stringers, in wrought iron give it properties not found in other forms of ferrous metal. There are approximately 250,000 inclusions per square inch. A fresh fracture shows a clear bluish color with a high silky luster and fibrous appearance.

Wrought iron lacks the carbon content necessary for hardening through heat treatment, but in areas where steel was uncommon or unknown, tools were sometimes cold-worked (hence cold iron) to harden them. An advantage of its low carbon content is its excellent weldability. Furthermore, sheet wrought iron cannot bend as much as steel sheet metal when cold worked. Wrought iron can be melted and cast; however, the product is no longer wrought iron, since the slag stringers characteristic of wrought iron disappear on melting, so the product resembles impure, cast, Bessemer steel. There is no engineering advantage to melting and casting wrought iron, as compared to using cast iron or steel, both of which are cheaper.

Due to the variations in iron ore origin and iron manufacture, wrought iron can be inferior or superior in corrosion resistance, compared to other iron alloys. There are many mechanisms behind its corrosion resistance. Chilton and Evans found that nickel enrichment bands reduce corrosion. They also found that in puddled, forged, and piled iron, the working-over of the metal spread out copper, nickel, and tin impurities that produce electrochemical conditions that slow down corrosion. The slag inclusions have been shown to disperse corrosion to an even film, enabling the iron to resist pitting. Another study has shown that slag inclusions are pathways to corrosion. Other studies show that sulfur in the wrought iron decreases corrosion resistance, while phosphorus increases corrosion resistance. Chloride ions also decrease wrought iron&#x27;s corrosion resistance.

Wrought iron may be welded in the same manner as mild steel, but the presence of oxide or inclusions will give defective results.
The material has a rough surface, so it can hold platings and coatings better than smooth steel. For instance, a galvanic zinc finish applied to wrought iron is approximately 25–40% thicker than the same finish on steel. In Table 1, the chemical composition of wrought iron is compared to that of pig iron and carbon steel. Although it appears that wrought iron and plain carbon steel have similar chemical compositions, that is deceptive. Most of the manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon in the wrought iron are incorporated into the slag fibers, making wrought iron purer than plain carbon steel.

Amongst its other properties, wrought iron becomes soft at red heat and can be easily forged and forge welded. It can be used to form temporary magnets, but it cannot be magnetized permanently, and is ductile, malleable, and tough.

===Ductility===
For most purposes, ductility rather than tensile strength is a more important measure of the quality of wrought iron. In tensile testing, the best irons are able to undergo considerable elongation before failure. Higher tensile wrought iron is brittle.

Because of the large number of boiler explosions on steamboats in the early 1800s, the U.S. Congress passed legislation in 1830 which approved funds for correcting the problem. The treasury awarded a $1500 contract to the Franklin Institute to conduct a study. As part of the study, Walter R. Johnson and Benjamin Reeves conducted strength tests on boiler iron using a tester they had built in 1832 based on a design by Lagerhjelm in Sweden. Because of misunderstandings about tensile strength and ductility, their work did little to reduce failures.

The importance of ductility was recognized by some very early in the development of tube boilers, evidenced by Thurston&#x27;s comment:

Various 19th century investigations of boiler explosions, especially those by insurance companies, found causes to be most commonly the result of operating boilers above the safe pressure range, either to get more power, or due to defective boiler pressure relief valves and difficulties of obtaining reliable indications of pressure and water levels. Poor fabrication was also a common problem. Also, the thickness of the iron in steam drums was low, by modern standards.

By the late 19th century, when metallurgists were able to better understand what properties and processes made good iron, iron in steam engines was being displaced by steel. Also, the old cylindrical boilers with fire tubes were displaced by water tube boilers, which are inherently safer.

===Purity===
In 2010, Gerry McDonnell demonstrated in England by analysis that a wrought iron bloom, from a traditional smelt, could be worked into 99.7% pure iron with no evidence of carbon. It was found that the stringers common to other wrought irons were not present, thus making it very malleable for the smith to work hot and cold. A commercial source of pure iron is available and is used by smiths as an alternative to traditional wrought iron and other new generation ferrous metals.

==Applications==
Wrought iron furniture has a long history, dating back to Roman times. There are 13th century wrought iron gates in Westminster Abbey in London, and wrought iron furniture seemed to reach its peak popularity in Britain in the 17th century, during the reign of William III and Mary II. However, cast iron and cheaper steel caused a gradual decline in wrought iron manufacture; the last wrought ironworks in Britain closed in 1974. 

It is also used to make home decor items such as baker&#x27;s racks, wine racks, pot racks, etageres, table bases, desks, gates, beds, candle holders, curtain rods, bars, and bar stools.

The vast majority of wrought iron available today is from reclaimed materials. Old bridges and anchor chains dredged from harbors are major sources. The greater corrosion resistance of wrought iron is due to the siliceous impurities (naturally occurring in iron ore), namely ferrous silicate.

Wrought iron has been used for decades as a generic term across the gate and fencing industry, even though mild steel is used for manufacturing these &quot;wrought iron&quot; gates. This is mainly because of the limited availability of true wrought iron. Steel can also be hot-dip galvanised to prevent corrosion, which cannot be done with wrought iron.

<text>The jejunum is the second part of the small intestine in humans and most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. Its lining is specialized for the absorption by enterocytes of small nutrient molecules which have been previously digested by enzymes in the duodenum.

The jejunum lies between the duodenum and the ileum and is considered to start at the suspensory muscle of the duodenum, a location called the duodenojejunal flexure. The division between the jejunum and ileum is not anatomically distinct. In adult humans, the small intestine is usually long (post mortem), about two-fifths of which (about ) is the jejunum.

==Structure==


The interior surface of the jejunum—which is exposed to ingested food—is covered in finger–like projections of mucosa, called villi, which increase the surface area of tissue available to absorb nutrients from ingested foodstuffs. The epithelial cells which line these villi have microvilli. The transport of nutrients across epithelial cells through the jejunum and ileum includes the passive transport of sugar fructose and the active transport of amino acids, small peptides, vitamins, and most glucose. The villi in the jejunum are much longer than in the duodenum or ileum.

The pH in the jejunum is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or slightly alkaline).

The jejunum and the ileum are suspended by mesentery which gives the bowel great mobility within the abdomen. It also contains circular and longitudinal smooth muscle which helps to move food along by a process known as peristalsis.

===Histology===

The jejunum contains very few Brunner&#x27;s glands (found in the duodenum) or Peyer&#x27;s patches (found in the ileum). However, there are a few jejunal lymph nodes suspended in its mesentery. The jejunum has many large circular folds in its submucosa called plicae circulares that increase the surface area for nutrient absorption. The plicae circulares are best developed in the jejunum.

There is no line of demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum. However, there are subtle histological differences:
* The jejunum has less fat inside its mesentery than the ileum. 
* The jejunum is typically of larger diameter than the ileum.
* The villi of the jejunum look like long, finger-like projections, and are a histologically identifiable structure. 
* While the length of the entire intestinal tract contains lymphoid tissue, only the ileum has abundant Peyer&#x27;s patches, which are unencapsulated lymphoid nodules that contain large numbers of lymphocytes and immune cells, like microfold cells.

==Function==
The lining of the jejunum is specialized for the absorption by enterocytes of small nutrient particles which have been previously digested by enzymes in the duodenum. Once absorbed, nutrients (with the exception of fat, which goes to the lymph) pass from the enterocytes into the enterohepatic circulation and enter the liver via the hepatic portal vein, where the blood is processed.

==Other animals==
In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear and the terms middle intestine or mid-gut may be used instead of jejunum.

==History==

===Etymology===
&quot;Jejunum&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot; (iēiūnus)&quot;, meaning &quot;fasting.&quot; It was so called because this part of the small intestine was frequently found to be void of food following death, due to its intensive peristaltic activity relative to the duodenum and ileum.
The Early Modern English adjective &quot;&quot; is derived from the same root.

<text>The small intestine or small bowel is an organ in the gastrointestinal tract where most of the absorption of nutrients from food takes place. It lies between the stomach and large intestine, and receives bile and pancreatic juice through the pancreatic duct to aid in digestion. The small intestine is about long and folds many times to fit in the abdomen. Although it is longer than the large intestine, it is called the small intestine because it is narrower in diameter.

The small intestine has three distinct regions – the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum, the shortest, is where preparation for absorption through small finger-like protrusions called villi begins. The jejunum is specialized for the absorption through its lining by enterocytes: small nutrient particles which have been previously digested by enzymes in the duodenum. The main function of the ileum is to absorb vitamin B12, bile salts, and whatever products of digestion that were not absorbed by the jejunum.

==Structure==

===Size===
The length of the small intestine can vary greatly, from as short as to as long as , also depending on the measuring technique used. The typical length in a living person is . The length depends both on how tall the person is and how the length is measured. Taller people generally have a longer small intestine and measurements are generally longer after death and when the bowel is empty.

It is approximately in diameter in newborns after 35 weeks of gestational age, and in diameter in adults. On abdominal X-rays, the small intestine is considered to be abnormally dilated when the diameter exceeds 3 cm. On CT scans, a diameter of over 2.5 cm is considered abnormally dilated. The surface area of the human small intestinal mucosa, due to enlargement caused by folds, villi and microvilli, averages .

===Parts===
The small intestine is divided into three structural parts.
* The duodenum is a short structure ranging from in length, and shaped like a &quot;C&quot;. It surrounds the head of the pancreas. It receives gastric chyme from the stomach, together with digestive juices from the pancreas (digestive enzymes) and the liver (bile). The digestive enzymes break down proteins and bile emulsifies fats into micelles. The duodenum contains Brunner&#x27;s glands, which produce a mucus-rich alkaline secretion containing bicarbonate. These secretions, in combination with bicarbonate from the pancreas, neutralize the stomach acids contained in gastric chyme.
* The jejunum is the midsection of the small intestine, connecting the duodenum to the ileum. It is about long, and contains the circular folds, and intestinal villi that increase its surface area. Products of digestion (sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids) are absorbed into the bloodstream here. The suspensory muscle of duodenum marks the division between the duodenum and the jejunum.
* The ileum: The final section of the small intestine. It is about 3 m long, and contains villi similar to the jejunum. It absorbs mainly vitamin B12 and bile acids, as well as any other remaining nutrients. The ileum joins to the cecum of the large intestine at the ileocecal junction.

The jejunum and ileum are suspended in the abdominal cavity by mesentery. The mesentery is part of the peritoneum. Arteries, veins, lymph vessels and nerves travel within the mesentery.

===Blood supply===
The small intestine receives a blood supply from the celiac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery. These are both branches of the aorta. The duodenum receives blood from the coeliac trunk via the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and from the superior mesenteric artery via the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery. These two arteries both have anterior and posterior branches that meet in the midline and anastomose. The jejunum and ileum receive blood from the superior mesenteric artery. Branches of the superior mesenteric artery form a series of arches within the mesentery known as arterial arcades, which may be several layers deep. Straight blood vessels known as vasa recta travel from the arcades closest to the ileum and jejunum to the organs themselves.

===Microanatomy===
The three sections of the small intestine look similar to each other at a microscopic level, but there are some important differences. The parts of the intestine are as follows:

=== Gene and protein expression ===
About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal duodenum. Some 300 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the duodenum with very few genes expressed only in the small intestine. The corresponding specific proteins are expressed in glandular cells of the mucosa, such as fatty acid binding protein FABP6. Most of the more specifically expressed genes in the small intestine are also expressed in the duodenum, for example FABP2 and the DEFA6 protein expressed in secretory granules of Paneth cells.

===Development===

The small intestine develops from the midgut of the primitive gut tube. By the fifth week of embryological life, the ileum begins to grow longer at a very fast rate, forming a U-shaped fold called the primary intestinal loop. The loop grows so fast in length that it outgrows the abdomen and protrudes through the umbilicus. By week 10, the loop retracts back into the abdomen. Between weeks six and ten the small intestine rotates anticlockwise, as viewed from the front of the embryo. It rotates a further 180 degrees after it has moved back into the abdomen. This process creates the twisted shape of the large intestine.

==Function==
Food from the stomach is allowed into the duodenum through the pylorus by a muscle called the pyloric sphincter.

===Digestion===
The small intestine is where most chemical digestion takes place. Many of the digestive enzymes that act in the small intestine are secreted by the pancreas and liver and enter the small intestine via the pancreatic duct. Pancreatic enzymes and bile from the gallbladder enter the small intestine in response to the hormone cholecystokinin, which is produced in the response to the presence of nutrients. Secretin, another hormone produced in the small intestine, causes additional effects on the pancreas, where it promotes the release of bicarbonate into the duodenum in order to neutralize the potentially harmful acid coming from the stomach.

The three major classes of nutrients that undergo digestion are proteins, lipids (fats) and carbohydrates:
* Proteins are degraded into small peptides and amino acids before absorption. Chemical breakdown begins in the stomach and continues in the small intestine. Proteolytic enzymes, including trypsin and chymotrypsin, are secreted by the pancreas and cleave proteins into smaller peptides. Carboxypeptidase, which is a pancreatic brush border enzyme, splits one amino acid at a time. Aminopeptidase and dipeptidase free the end amino acid products.
* Lipids (fats) are degraded into fatty acids and glycerol. Pancreatic lipase breaks down triglycerides into free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Pancreatic lipase works with the help of the salts from the bile secreted by the liver and stored in the gall bladder. Bile salts attach to triglycerides to help emulsify them, which aids access by pancreatic lipase. This occurs because the lipase is water-soluble but the fatty triglycerides are hydrophobic and tend to orient towards each other and away from the watery intestinal surroundings. The bile salts emulsify the triglycerides in the watery surroundings until the lipase can break them into the smaller components that are able to enter the villi for absorption.
* Some carbohydrates are degraded into simple sugars, or monosaccharides (e.g., glucose). Pancreatic amylase breaks down some carbohydrates (notably starch) into oligosaccharides. Other carbohydrates pass undigested into the large intestine for further handling by intestinal bacteria. Brush border enzymes take over from there. The most important brush border enzymes are dextrinase and glucoamylase, which further break down oligosaccharides. Other brush border enzymes are maltase, sucrase and lactase. Lactase is absent in some adult humans and, for them, lactose (a disaccharide), as well as most polysaccharides, is not digested in the small intestine. Some carbohydrates, such as cellulose, are not digested at all, despite being made of multiple glucose units. This is because the cellulose is made out of beta-glucose, making the inter-monosaccharidal bindings different from the ones present in starch, which consists of alpha-glucose. Humans lack the enzyme for splitting the beta-glucose-bonds, something reserved for herbivores and bacteria from the large intestine.

===Absorption===
Digested food is now able to pass into the blood vessels in the wall of the intestine through either diffusion or active transport. The small intestine is the site where most of the nutrients from ingested food are absorbed. The inner wall, or mucosa, of the small intestine, is lined with intestinal epithelium, a simple columnar epithelium. Structurally, the mucosa is covered in wrinkles or flaps called circular folds, which are considered permanent features in the mucosa. They are distinct from rugae which are considered non-permanent or temporary allowing for distention and contraction. From the circular folds project microscopic finger-like pieces of tissue called villi (Latin for &quot;shaggy hair&quot;). The individual epithelial cells also have finger-like projections known as microvilli. The functions of the circular folds, the villi, and the microvilli are to increase the amount of surface area available for the absorption of nutrients, and to limit the loss of said nutrients to intestinal fauna.

Each villus has a network of capillaries and fine lymphatic vessels called lacteals close to its surface. The epithelial cells of the villi transport nutrients from the lumen of the intestine into these capillaries (amino acids and carbohydrates) and lacteals (lipids). The absorbed substances are transported via the blood vessels to different organs of the body where they are used to build complex substances such as the proteins required by our body. The material that remains undigested and unabsorbed passes into the large intestine.

Absorption of the majority of nutrients takes place in the jejunum, with the following notable exceptions:
* Iron is absorbed in the duodenum.
* Folate (Vitamin B9) is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum.
* Vitamin B12 and bile salts are absorbed in the terminal ileum. Vitamin B12 will only be absorbed by the ileum after binding to a protein known as intrinsic factor.
* Water is absorbed by osmosis and lipids by passive diffusion throughout the small intestine.
* Sodium bicarbonate is absorbed by active transport and glucose and amino acid co-transport
* Fructose is absorbed by facilitated diffusion.

===Immunological===
The small intestine supports the body&#x27;s immune system. The presence of gut flora appears to contribute positively to the host&#x27;s immune system.
Peyer&#x27;s patches, located within the ileum of the small intestine, are an important part of the digestive tract&#x27;s local immune system. They are part of the lymphatic system, and provide a site for antigens from potentially harmful bacteria or other microorganisms in the digestive tract to be sampled, and subsequently presented to the immune system.

==Clinical significance==
The small intestine is a complex organ, and as such, there are a very large number of possible conditions that may affect the function of the small bowel.

==Other animals==
The small intestine is found in all tetrapods and also in teleosts, although its form and length vary enormously between species. In teleosts, it is relatively short, typically around one and a half times the length of the fish&#x27;s body. It commonly has a number of &quot;pyloric caeca&quot;, small pouch-like structures along its length that help to increase the overall surface area of the organ for digesting food. There is no ileocaecal valve in teleosts, with the boundary between the small intestine and the rectum being marked only by the end of the digestive epithelium.

In tetrapods, the ileocaecal valve is always present, opening into the colon. The length of the small intestine is typically longer in tetrapods than in teleosts, but is especially so in herbivores, as well as in mammals and birds, which have a higher metabolic rate than amphibians or reptiles. The lining of the small intestine includes microscopic folds to increase its surface area in all vertebrates, but only in mammals do these develop into true villi.

The boundaries between the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum are somewhat vague even in humans, and such distinctions are either ignored when discussing the anatomy of other animals, or are essentially arbitrary.

There is no small intestine as such in non-teleost fish, such as sharks, sturgeons, and lungfish. Instead, the digestive part of the gut forms a spiral intestine, connecting the stomach to the rectum. In this type of gut, the intestine itself is relatively straight but has a long fold running along the inner surface in a spiral fashion, sometimes for dozens of turns. This valve greatly increases both the surface area and the effective length of the intestine. The lining of the spiral intestine is similar to that of the small intestine in teleosts and non-mammalian tetrapods.

In lampreys, the spiral valve is extremely small, possibly because their diet requires little digestion. Hagfish have no spiral valve at all, with digestion occurring for almost the entire length of the intestine, which is not subdivided into different regions.

==Society and culture==
In traditional Chinese medicine, the small intestine is a yang organ.

<text>The appendix (: appendices or appendixes; also vermiform appendix; cecal (or caecal, cæcal) appendix; vermix; or vermiform process) is a finger-like, blind-ended tube connected to the cecum, from which it develops in the embryo. 

The cecum is a pouch-like structure of the large intestine, located at the junction of the small and the large intestines. The term &quot;vermiform&quot; comes from Latin and means &quot;worm-shaped&quot;. The appendix was once considered a vestigial organ, but this view has changed since the early 2000s. Research suggests that the appendix may serve an important purpose as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria.

== Structure ==
The human appendix averages in length, ranging from . The diameter of the appendix is , and more than is considered a thickened or inflamed appendix. The longest appendix ever removed was long. The appendix is usually located in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen, near the right hip bone. The base of the appendix is located beneath the ileocecal valve that separates the large intestine from the small intestine. Its position within the abdomen corresponds to a point on the surface known as McBurney&#x27;s point.

The appendix is connected to the mesentery in the lower region of the ileum, by a short region of the mesocolon known as the mesoappendix.

===Variation===
Some identical twins—known as mirror image twins—can have a mirror-imaged anatomy, a congenital condition with the appendix located in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen instead of the lower right. Intestinal malrotation may also cause displacement of the appendix to the left side.

While the base of the appendix is typically located below the ileocecal valve, the tip of the appendix can be variably located—in the pelvis, outside the peritoneum or behind the cecum. The prevalence of the different positions varies amongst populations with the retrocecal position being most common in Ghana and Sudan, with 67.3% and 58.3% occurrence respectively, in comparison to Iran and Bosnia where the pelvic position is most common, with 55.8% and 57.7% occurrence respectively.

In very rare cases, the appendix may not be present at all (laparotomies for suspected appendicitis have given a frequency of 1 in 100,000).

Sometimes there is a semi-circular fold of mucous membrane at the opening of the appendix. This &quot;valve of the vermiform appendix&quot; is also called Gerlach&#x27;s valve.

==Functions==

===Maintaining gut flora===
Although it has been long accepted that the immune tissue surrounding the appendix and elsewhere in the gut—called gut-associated lymphoid tissue—carries out several important functions, explanations were lacking for the distinctive shape of the appendix and its apparent lack of specific importance and function as judged by an absence of side effects following its removal. Therefore, the notion that the appendix is only vestigial became widely held.

William Parker, Randy Bollinger, and colleagues at Duke University proposed in 2007 that the appendix serves as a haven for useful bacteria when illness flushes the bacteria from the rest of the intestines. This proposition is based on an understanding that emerged by the early 2000s of how the immune system supports the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria, in combination with many well-known features of the appendix, including its architecture, its location just below the normal one-way flow of food and germs in the large intestine, and its association with copious amounts of immune tissue. 

Research performed at Winthrop–University Hospital showed that individuals without an appendix were four times as likely to have a recurrence of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; colitis. The appendix, therefore, may act as a &quot;safe house&quot; for beneficial bacteria. This reservoir of bacteria could then serve to repopulate the gut flora in the digestive system following a bout of dysentery or cholera or to boost it following a milder gastrointestinal illness.

===Immune and lymphatic systems===
The appendix has been identified as an important component of mammalian mucosal immune function, particularly B cell-mediated immune responses and extrathymically derived T cells. This structure helps in the proper movement and removal of waste matter in the digestive system, contains lymphatic vessels that regulate pathogens, and lastly, might even produce early defences that prevent deadly diseases. Additionally, it is thought that this may provide more immune defences from invading pathogens and getting the lymphatic system&#x27;s B and T cells to fight the viruses and bacteria that infect that portion of the bowel and training them so that immune responses are targeted and more able to reliably and less dangerously fight off pathogens. In addition, there are different immune cells called innate lymphoid cells that function in the gut to help the appendix maintain digestive health. 

Research also shows a positive correlation between the existence of the appendix and the concentration of cecal lymphoid tissue, which supports the suggestion that not only does the appendix evolve as a complex with the cecum but also has major immune benefits.

==Clinical significance==
Common diseases of the appendix (in humans) are appendicitis and carcinoid tumors (appendiceal carcinoid). Appendix cancer accounts for about 1 in 200 of all gastrointestinal malignancies. In rare cases, adenomas are also present.

===Appendicitis===

Appendicitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the appendix. Pain often begins in the center of the abdomen, corresponding to the appendix&#x27;s development as part of the embryonic midgut. This pain is typically a dull, poorly localized, visceral pain.

As the inflammation progresses, the pain begins to localize more clearly to the right lower quadrant, as the peritoneum becomes inflamed. This peritoneal inflammation, or peritonitis, results in rebound tenderness (pain upon removal of pressure rather than the application of pressure). In particular, it presents at McBurney&#x27;s point, 1/3 of the way along a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. Typically, point (skin) pain is not present until the parietal peritoneum is inflamed, as well. Fever and an immune system response are also characteristic of appendicitis. Other signs and symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, low-grade fever that may get worse, constipation or diarrhea, abdominal bloating, or flatulence.

Appendicitis usually requires the removal of the inflamed appendix, in an appendectomy either by laparotomy or laparoscopy. Untreated, the appendix may rupture, leading to peritonitis, followed by shock, and, if still untreated, death.

===Surgery===

The surgical removal of the appendix is called an appendectomy. This removal is normally performed as an emergency procedure when the patient is suffering from acute appendicitis. In the absence of surgical facilities, intravenous antibiotics are used to delay or avoid the onset of sepsis. In some cases, the appendicitis resolves completely; more often, an inflammatory mass forms around the appendix. This is a relative contraindication to surgery.

The appendix is also used for the construction of an efferent urinary conduit, in an operation known as the Mitrofanoff procedure, in people with a neurogenic bladder.

The appendix is also used as a means to access the colon in children with paralysed bowels or major rectal sphincter problems. The appendix is brought out to the skin surface and the child/parent can then attach a catheter and easily wash out the colon (via normal defaecation) using an appropriate solution.

==History==
Charles Darwin suggested that the appendix was mainly used by earlier hominids for digesting fibrous vegetation, then evolved to take on a new purpose over time. The very long cecum of some herbivorous animals, such as in the horse or the koala, appears to support this hypothesis. The koala&#x27;s cecum enables it to host bacteria that specifically help to break down cellulose. Human ancestors may have also relied upon this system when they lived on a diet rich in foliage. 

As people began to eat more easily digested foods, they may have become less reliant on cellulose-rich plants for energy. As the cecum became less necessary for digestion, mutations that were previously deleterious (and would have hindered evolutionary progress) were no longer important, so the mutations survived. It is suggested that these alleles became more frequent and the cecum continued to shrink. After millions of years, the once-necessary cecum degraded to be the appendix of modern humans.

Dr. Heather F. Smith of Midwestern University and colleagues explained:

Recently ... improved understanding of gut immunity has merged with current thinking in biological and medical science, pointing to an apparent function of the mammalian cecal appendix as a safe-house for symbiotic gut microbes, preserving the flora during times of gastrointestinal infection in societies without modern medicine. This function is potentially a selective force for the evolution and maintenance of the appendix.
Three morphotypes of cecal-appendices can be described among mammals based primarily on the shape of the cecum: a distinct appendix branching from a rounded or sac-like cecum (as in many primate species), an appendix located at the apex of a long and voluminous cecum (as in the rabbit, greater glider and Cape dune mole rat), and an appendix in the absence of a pronounced cecum (as in the wombat). In addition, long narrow appendix-like structures are found in mammals that either lack an apparent cecum (as in monotremes) or lack a distinct junction between the cecum and appendix-like structure (as in the koala). A cecal appendix has evolved independently at least twice and represents yet another example of convergence in morphology between Australian marsupials and placentals in the rest of the world. Although the appendix has been lost by numerous species, it has also been maintained for more than 80 million years in at least one clade.

In a 2013 paper, the appendix was found to have independently evolved in different animals at least 32 times (and perhaps as many as 38 times) and to have been lost no more than six times throughout history. A more recent study using similar methods on an updated database yielded similar, though less spectacular results, with at least 29 gains and at the most 12 losses (all of which were ambiguous), and this is still significantly asymmetrical. 

This suggests that the cecal appendix has a selective advantage in many situations and argues strongly against its vestigial nature. Given that this organ may have a selective advantage in numerous situations, it appears to be associated with greater maximal longevity, for a given body mass. For example, in a 2023 study, the protective functions conferred against diarrhea were observed in young primates. This complex evolutionary history of the appendix, along with a great heterogeneity in its evolutionary rate in various taxa, suggests that it is a recurrent trait.

Such a function may be useful in a culture lacking modern sanitation and healthcare practice, where diarrhea may be prevalent. Current epidemiological data on the cause of death in developing countries collected by the World Health Organization in 2001 show that acute diarrhea is now the fourth leading cause of disease-related death in developing countries (data summarized by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). Two of the other leading causes of death are expected to have exerted limited or no selection pressure.
