<doc id="104612" wikidata="Q697765" url="?curid=104612" title="Rudolf Maister">
<text>Rudolf Maister (pen name: Vojanov; 29 March 1874 – 26 July 1934) was a Slovene military officer, poet and political activist. The soldiers who fought under Maister&#x27;s command in northern Slovenia became known as &quot;Maister&#x27;s fighters&quot; (). Maister was also an accomplished poet and self-taught painter.

==Life==
===Early career and fight for Styria===
Maister was born in the Upper Carniolan commercial town of Kamnik, then part of Austria-Hungary. He came from a German-speaking family. Letters from his youth have been preserved in which he expressed his rejection of Slavs and Jews, but eventually he turned to the Slovene national cause. A career soldier, during World War I, he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1917, he was sent to Graz promoted to the rank of a major. In 1918, near the end of the war when it was obvious that Austria-Hungary was losing, the city council of Marburg, then German-speaking by large majority, proclaimed the town part of German-Austria. Maister organized Slovene volunteer forces of 4000 soldiers and 200 officers and in the night of 23 November 1918 seized control of the city of Maribor and the surrounding region of Lower Styria. This date has been recognized as a state holiday in Slovenia since 2005. The Slovene National Council for Lower Styria awarded him the rank of general on November 1. The German-speaking city was thus secured for the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which united with the Kingdom of Serbia into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on December 1. Maister&#x27;s rank as a general was confirmed by the National Government of the Slovene part of the Kingdom as a &quot;lieutenant with the title and character of a general&quot; on 11 December 1918, which was later also confirmed by the Belgrade Government. On 14 January he commanded Slovenian forces in the Battle of Lučane.

===Marburg&#x27;s Bloody Sunday===
On 27 January 1919, Germans awaiting the American peace delegation at the marketplace in Maribor () were fired on by Slovenian troops under the command of Maister. Nine Germans were killed and more than eighteen were seriously wounded. The responsibility for the shooting has not been conclusively established. German sources accused Maister&#x27;s troops of shooting without cause, while Slovenian witnesses, such as Maks Pohar, testified that the Germans (some still in the uniforms of the German paramilitary organization called the Green Guard) attacked the Slovene soldiers guarding the city hall. The Austrian Germans allegedly attacked the police inspector, Ivan Senekovič, and then pressed towards the Slovenian soldiers in front of the city hall. A Slovenian version of this event involves a German firing a revolver in the direction of the Slovenian soldiers, who responded spontaneously by firing into the civilian crowd. The event became known as Marburg&#x27;s Bloody Sunday ().

===Fight for Carinthia===
In April 1919, Maister&#x27;s forces joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes Army&#x27;s offensive in Carinthia. Maister joined them later and took part of the capture of Klagenfurt. After the Carinthian Plebiscite, in which the majority of the local Slovenian population decided to remain part of Austria, Maister withdrew to private life. He spent most of his later life in an estate near Planina in Inner Carniola.

==Poetry==
Maister also wrote poetry, which he published in two collected volumes in 1904 and in 1929. Most of his poetry follows Post-Romantic aesthetics, and it is influenced by the 19th-century Slovene lyrical and patriotic poetry of Simon Jenko, Simon Gregorčič, and Anton Aškerc.

<text>Luverne ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Crenshaw County, Alabama, United States. The city describes itself as &quot;The Friendliest City in the South&quot;, a slogan that appears on its &quot;welcome&quot; signs. At the 2020 census, the population was 2,765.

==History==
Luverne was one of numerous towns developed in the state as a result of railroad construction.

On July 2, 1880, the Montgomery and Southern Railway was created to construct a new railroad linking Montgomery to the Florida coast. The company completed around of narrow gauge track by September 18, 1882. The company was reorganized as the Montgomery and Florida Railway in May 1886, and a second time as the Northwest and Florida Railroad in 1888. In November 1888, the railroad reached the site of Luverne in the central part of Crenshaw County, near the Patsaliga River. Now totaling the line was converted to standard gauge by July 1889 and it was decided to proceed no further. The Alabama Terminal and Improvement Company, a subsidiary of the Alabama Midland Railway, controlled the railroad by 1889 and the line from Montgomery to Luverne was into the network of the latter.

The new railroad terminus attracted related development, and the town grew. It was incorporated in 1891, and became a center of timbering in the Piney Woods of southern Alabama, as the land was not fertile enough to be suitable for large-scale cotton plantation agriculture.

In 1893, the citizens of Crenshaw County voted to move the county seat from Rutledge to the more populous Luverne.

By the late 1930s, lynchings of African Americans were increasingly conducted in small groups or in secret, rather than in the former mass public displays. On June 22, 1940, an African-American man named Jesse Thornton was lynched in Luverne for failing to address a white man with the title of &quot;Mister&quot;. He was fatally shot and his body was later found in the Patsaliga River. The Equal Justice Initiative documented that the white man Thornton had apparently offended by his Jim Crow infraction was a police officer. This was the only lynching recorded in the county.

<doc id="104615" wikidata="Q980091" url="?curid=104615" title="Halma">
<text>Halma (from , meaning “leap&quot;) is a strategy board game invented in 1883 or 1884 by George Howard Monks, an American thoracic surgeon at Harvard Medical School. His inspiration was the English game &quot;Hoppity&quot; which was devised in 1854.

The gameboard is checkered and divided into 16×16 squares. Pieces may be small checkers or counters, or wooden or plastic cones or men resembling small chess pawns. Piece colors are typically black and white for two-player games, and various colors or other distinction in games for four players.

== Overview ==
The game is played by two or four players seated at opposing corners of the board. The game is won by being first to transfer all of one&#x27;s pieces from one&#x27;s own camp into the camp in the opposing corner. For four-player games played in teams, the winner is the first team to race both sets of pieces into opposing camps. On each turn, a player either moves a single piece to an adjacent open square, or jumps over one or more pieces in sequence.

== Rules ==

=== Setup ===
* The board consists of a grid of 16×16 squares. 
* Each player&#x27;s &quot;camp&quot; consists of a cluster of adjacent squares in one corner of the board. These camps are delineated on the board.
** For two-player games, each player&#x27;s camp is a cluster of 19 squares. The camps are in opposite corners.
** For four-player games, each player&#x27;s camp is a cluster of 13 squares. Each of the four corners of the board is a camp.
* Each player has a set of pieces in a distinct color, of the same number as squares in each camp.
* The game starts with each player&#x27;s camp filled by pieces of their own color.

=== Play sequence ===

* Players randomly determine who will move first.
* Pieces can move in eight possible directions (orthogonally and diagonally).
* Each player&#x27;s turn consists of moving a single piece of one&#x27;s own color in one of the following plays:
** One &quot;move&quot; to an empty square:
*** Place the piece in an empty adjacent square.
*** This move ends the play.
** One or more &quot;jump&quot;s over adjacent pieces:
*** An adjacent piece of any color can be jumped if there is an adjacent empty square on the directly opposite side of that piece.
*** Place the piece in the empty square on the opposite side of the jumped piece.
*** The piece that was jumped over is unaffected and remains on the board.
*** After any jump, one may make further jumps using the same piece, or end the play.
* Once a piece has reached the opposing camp, a play cannot result in that piece leaving the camp.
* If the current play results in having every square of the opposing camp occupied by one&#x27;s own pieces, the acting player wins. Otherwise, play proceeds clockwise around the board.

== Comparison to other games ==
* The mechanic of jumping pieces is reminiscent of draughts (checkers) but differs in that no opposing pieces are ever captured or otherwise withdrawn from the board nor is jumping compulsory.
* Chinese Checkers, a variant of Halma, was originally published in 1892 as &quot;Stern-Halma&quot; (German for &quot;Star Halma&quot;) and later renamed upon marketing to the United States to appear more exotic. The name is misleading, since the game has no historical connection with China, nor is it a checkers game.

== Variations ==

There are also 8×8 and 10×10 board variations, either of which is adequate for two players and they have 10 and 15 pieces per player, respectively, and a version for three players each with fifteen pieces arranged as a six-pointed star. 

There are various online versions, usually for two-player, turn-based play.

Some sites implement a rule variation stating that a player automatically loses if they still have a piece in their start region after a certain number of moves (typically 30 for the 8×8 game, 50 for the 10×10 game). Fast-advancing players occasionally attempt to blockade an opposing piece, but this tactic can backfire if the other player is aware of it. In non-electronic versions, the number of moves is not normally counted.

== Basic strategy and tactics ==
A game of Halma has three distinct phases. The beginning (before opposing pieces come into contact) is usually a set-piece battle, with players setting up their favoured openings. The middle (when opposing pieces are blocking or jumping each other) is usually characterised by opportunistic play; the player with the most patience to check the whole board for opportunities, including those gained by moving backwards in order to move forwards, will gain an advantage. Players should also set up for the endgame (when opposing pieces have passed one another and must run for home), avoiding stragglers.

As with most board games, early control of the center is a key tactic, as it provides additional mobility. Pieces can form a two-layer blocking wall, deflecting the opponent from the center and forcing them into a longer trajectory; however, if the opponent builds an adjacent wall, then the first player to disband his wall usually suffers a strategic disadvantage.

Paired pieces move faster than single pieces in the endgame. This means that a player with a pair of &quot;leapfrogging&quot; pieces has an advantage over a player with two individual stragglers.

The larger boards have more strategic combinations available than the smaller boards, and the four player game offers more tactical intrigue than the two-player game.

In the 8x8 version of the game, the middle-game involves three main considerations: keep your army together; make jumps as long as possible, particularly diagonally; and avoid stranded pieces. The end-game is akin to a puzzle race with each side trying the minimum number of intricate moves to reach the final position.

Arab was incorporated on December 10, 1892.

Arab was a sundown town, with a sign warning Blacks not to stay in Arab after dark and, historically, even barring them during the day. Ku Klux Klan material was disseminated in Arab in 2014 and 2015.

<doc id="104619" wikidata="Q702373" url="?curid=104619" title="Super Dimension Fortress Macross">
<text>is an anime television series from 1982. According to story creator Shoji Kawamori, it depicts &quot;a love triangle against the backdrop of great battles&quot; during the first Human-alien war. It is the first part of the &quot;Super Dimension&quot; trilogy and the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise.

&quot;Macross&quot; features mechanical designs by Kazutaka Miyatake and Shoji Kawamori (both of Studio Nue) and character designs by Haruhiko Mikimoto of Artland. &quot;Macross&quot; also created one of the first anime idols Lynn Minmay, turning her voice actress Mari Iijima into an instant celebrity, and launching her musical career. Most of its animation (with edited content, story changes and revised dialogue) was adapted in the US for the first saga of &quot;Robotech&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1999, a city-sized alien spacecraft crashes in South Ataria Island on Earth. Over the course of 10 years the military organization U.N. Spacy reverse-engineers its technology and rebuilds the spacecraft, naming it the SDF-1 &quot;Macross&quot;. In 2009 at the launch ceremony of the &quot;Macross&quot;, a young civilian pilot, Hikaru Ichijyo, comes to visit the &quot;Macross&quot; upon U.N. Spacy pilot Roy Focker&#x27;s request. During the launch ceremony, a space war fleet from an alien race of humanoid giants arrives into the solar system and identifies the &quot;Macross&quot; as a former battleship used by their enemies, the Supervision Army. As the aliens, known as the Zentradi, approach the &quot;Macross&quot;, the original systems override the crew&#x27;s commands and fire its main cannon, wiping out the advance alien scouts and starting a war. While Hikaru takes the new VF-1 Valkyrie on a test flight the aliens retaliate. He then encounters Lynn Minmay and rescues her from the aliens. The &quot;Macross&quot; crew attempts to use the experimental &quot;Fold System&quot; (faster-than-light drives) to escape to the Moon&#x27;s orbit, but instead it accidentally takes the &quot;Macross&quot; and South Ataria Island to the edge of the solar system. The people from the &quot;Macross&quot; salvage everything they can, including the city surrounding the ship and its civilians (who have survived in special safety shelters, which were transported along intact), and attach two aircraft carriers to the ship. Since the fold systems have vanished after the jump, the &quot;Macross&quot; is forced to make its way back to Earth by conventional power.

The Zentradi suspect the humans might be their creators, the Protoculture. Under the command of Britai Kridanik and Exsedol Folmo, they plot ways to understand them. Fearful of their old combat directives of not interfering with Protoculture, the Zentradi perform attacks to test their theories about the people on board the &quot;Macross&quot;, and even have their Zentradi soldiers &quot;micloned&quot; (miniaturized) to learn more about their culture. The Zentradi capture several &quot;Macross&quot; personnel, including Officer Misa Hayase and Hikaru, to study. Boddole Zer, Supreme Commander of the Zentradi, is puzzled over things such as relationships amongst males and females. He confirms that the Miclones &quot;are&quot; Protoculture during a demonstrated kiss between Hayase and Hikaru. After escaping, Hikaru and the others report their findings to their superiors, who have trouble accepting the reasons behind the Zentradi attacks as well as the huge forces the aliens possess.

After much difficulty returning to Earth, the UN Spacy refuses to allow the &quot;Macross&quot; and the civilian passengers to return to land. Minmay&#x27;s cousin, Lynn Kaifun, decides to join the &quot;Macross&quot; to see his parents and also look after Minmay. Because of Kaifun&#x27;s relationship and constant contact with Minmay, the pair eventually enter a romantic relationship. After deliberation, the UN Spacy orders the &quot;Macross&quot; to leave Earth as a means to get the Zentradi away from them. During all these events, a female Zentradi ace fighter pilot, Milia Fallyna, is micloned and attempts to assassinate Maximilian Jenius, an ace UN Spacy pilot. Attempting to kill him during a knife duel, Milia is defeated and falls in love with Max, and the two are subsequently married. Their wedding aboard the &quot;Macross&quot; is broadcast to the Zentradi as a message that aliens and humans can co-exist. Since the Zentradi&#x27;s exposure to culture and to Lynn Minmay&#x27;s songs, some of them become eager to join the humans. Believing the &quot;miclone contamination&quot; is becoming a threat to all Zentradi forces, Boddole Zer orders his entire army to exterminate the human race and all those Zentradi previously exposed to human culture. Because Britai Kridanik was &quot;contaminated&quot; as well, he works with the humans to defeat the main Zentradi forces.

The resulting battle culminates in the large scale devastation of Earth, but the people of the SDF-1 survive. After Boddole Zer is killed and his armada defeated, the surviving humans and their Zentradi allies begin rebuilding Earth.

Two years after the end of the first Space War the transition into the Human ways becomes difficult to some Zentradi who cannot stand the idea of a pacified life. Quamzin Kravshera constantly incites conflicts towards the civilians. He repairs a damaged Zentradi warship to return to his old ways and attacks the new Macross City built around the SDF-1. Moments before the final Zentradi attack, Misa Hayase tells Hikaru Ichijyo of her feelings for him and her decision to leave to space in a colonization mission to preserve human culture across the galaxy. Lynn Minmay, who was left by Kaifun and now loves Hikaru, does not want him to leave to join the fight. However, Hikaru still goes to defend the city anyway. Eventually Quamzin is killed. After a long emotional conflict Hikaru finally decides to be with Misa and join the colonization mission, but the two remain good friends with Minmay in the end.

==Episode list==
* Note: When &quot;Macross&quot; was first put in production, the anime was going to end with a total of 24 episodes, but due to popularity, it was expanded to a total of 36 episodes. 

==Sequels and prequel==
A number of sequels and one prequel to the series have been produced.

==Production==
The series title uses the name of the main spacecraft (which is usually shortened to &quot;Macross&quot; as it is Earth&#x27;s first &quot;Super Dimension Fortress&quot;). The original name for the &quot;Macross&quot; project was &quot;Battle City Megaload&quot; (or &quot;Battle City Megaroad&quot;, as the Japanese transliteration to either or gives the title a double meaning in reference to the story line: &quot;Megaload&quot;, referring to the spacecraft containing an entire city of people; and &quot;Megaroad&quot;, referring to the long journey through space back to Earth). However, the director of Big West, one of the later sponsors of the project, was a fan of Shakespeare and wanted the series and the spacecraft to be named &quot;Macbeth&quot; (). A compromise was made with the title &quot;Macross&quot; () due to its similar pronunciation to &quot;Macbeth&quot; in Japanese and because it still contained connotations to the original title. The word &quot;Macross&quot; also comes from a wordplay combination of the prefix &quot;macro&quot; in reference to its massive size (though when compared with the alien ships in the series, it is only a relatively small capital ship) and the distance they must cross.

&quot;Super Dimension Fortress&quot; prefix (&quot;Chō Jikū Yōsai&quot;) is a wordplay on an intermediary working title for the series, which was originally &quot;Super Dreadnought Fortress Macross&quot; (&quot;Chō Dokyū Yōsai Makurosu&quot;).

Originally proposed in 1980 and greatly inspired by &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; (1979-1980), the show created by Studio Nue (from an original concept by newcomer member Shoji Kawamori) was initially sponsored by a group called the &quot;Wiz&quot; (&quot;Uizu&quot;) Corporation that was prepared to fund a 48-episode run. &quot;Wiz&quot; wanted to produce the Sci-Fi show as an outer space comedy, but this clashed with Studio Nue&#x27;s original idea of a more serious and epic &quot;space opera&quot; storyline. The resulting animosity between both companies made the initial pre-production of the series very difficult and full of delays.

However, by 1981 Wiz had gone out of business and the &quot;Megaload/Megaroad&quot; (&quot;Macross&quot;) project seemed to be in permanent hiatus. Studio Nue bought the rights of the show from &quot;Wiz&quot; and searched for a sponsor with no avail. Big West, an advertising agency looking to branch out into animation sponsorship, approached Studio Nue about the project and agreed to sponsor it. Big West insisted on a leaner budget, not convinced that the show would pan out as profitable and pared the episode count to 27 episodes (meaning the show would have ended with the battle against Boddole Zer&#x27;s fleet). Even then, Big West found that the show was going to run more expensive than it had bargained for, and to secure more money, entered into a partnership with animation studio Tatsunoko Production which included international distribution (what would culminate in the creation of the &quot;Robotech&quot; adaptation a few years later).

When Macross debuted on 3 October 1982 (with only three episodes made so far) its stunning success among Japanese television audiences convinced Big West to approve an extension to 36 episodes, allowing the staff to end with the &quot;two years after&quot; story arc.

Animation work was contracted out to a number of sub-contracting studios, including Artland (Haruhiko Mikimoto&#x27;s employer), the nascent AIC and Gainax studios, as well as the Tatsunoko-supplied AnimeFriend and Star Pro. AnimeFriend and Star Pro are infamously notorious among fans of the show for having brought in very spotty, off-model and continuity error-laden animation work.

There were plans for a splashy ending to the series, one that would have shown major characters Misa Hayase and Hikaru Ichijo blasting off in the colonization ship &quot;SDF-2 Megaroad-01&quot;, but the sequence was scrapped due to lack of time and budget. However, due to fan demand this sequence was later used in the &quot;Macross Flashback 2012&quot; OVA released in 1987.

&quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; was produced as the first of the three &quot;Super Dimension&quot; mecha anime television series in Japan. It was followed by &quot;Super Dimension Century Orguss&quot; (1983) and &quot;Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross&quot; (1984). These shows were related in name only.

==Media==

===Anime===

In 1984, Harmony Gold licensed the first &quot;Macross&quot; series from Tatsunoko and planned to dub the series on home video. In 1985, Harmony Gold, without permission from Studio Neu or Big West, edited and rewrote the series with &quot;The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross&quot; and &quot;Genesis Climber Mospeada&quot;, collectively releasing them as &quot;Robotech&quot;, to syndicate on weekday television and to promote a Revell model line. &quot;Robotech&quot;&#x27;s credits listed only the English adaptation&#x27;s production crew and two Tatsunoko producers. No mention of the creators is shown in the credits. In 1999, Harmony Gold asserted it had exclusive rights to the &quot;distribution of the Macross television series and the right to create and authorize the sale of merchandise based on such series&quot; outside Japan, and began sending cease-and-desist letters to import toy dealers, temporarily barring &quot;Macross&quot;-related merchandise from North America.

The merchandise has since been imported again by the same toy dealers in direct sales.

In 2000, Big West and Studio Nue took Tatsunoko Productions to the Tokyo District Court over who had the rights to the first &quot;Macross&quot; series, due to Harmony Gold&#x27;s attempt to bar Japanese Macross merchandise in North America the previous year. During production, Big West entered into a partnership with Tatsunoko to assist in the production of the series in a deal where it acquired the license to distribute the show worldwide (i.e., outside Japan), as well as earning some royalties to the merchandise. Tatsunoko then sub-licensed &quot;Macross&quot; to Harmony Gold USA in 1984. In 2002, the Tokyo District Court ruled that Big West/Studio Nue is the sole owner of the original character and mecha designs for the first series,
while that same court ruled in 2003 that Tatsunoko owned the production rights to the first series.

In 2001 the series was sub-licensed in North America by AnimEigo, who restored the series and released it unedited on DVD with Japanese audio and English subtitles. At first a limited edition pre-order boxset across nine discs was released on 21 December 2001. Preorders were available on AnimEigo&#x27;s web store. Three smaller boxsets, each comprising three discs, were released from 10 September 2002. Finally, AnimEigo released nine individual volumes. In 2003 Madman Entertainment released a six-disc PAL format version of this edition entitled &quot;Macross Ultimate Collection&quot;.

In the summer of 2005, ADV Films announced that it would be releasing an English dub of &quot;Macross&quot; on 10 January 2006. This is the first uncut, unedited English dub for &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;, and featured Mari Iijima returning to reprise the role of Lynn Minmay. This version was released by Hulu for online streaming in the United States in February 2010 and was removed in February 2013.

On April 8, 2021, Harmony Gold and Big West reached an agreement to allow Big West to release &quot;Macross&quot; globally, but the original series remains unreleased.

===Manga===
Four manga adaptations of the TV series by different artists were serialized in 1982. A new manga adaptation called began releasing in Japan in 2009. It is a comic format alternate telling of the events in &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; (with modern character and mecha designs) that was serialized in the &quot;Macross Ace&quot; manga magazine until its cancellation, being moved to &quot;Newtype Ace&quot; manga magazine until its cancellation, then to &quot;ComicWalker&quot; online magazine, and then to Cygames &quot;Psychomi&quot; online magazine. It was collected into six volumes. The artist for the new manga series is Haruhiko Mikimoto, who was the character designer for the original &quot;Macross&quot;.

===Video games===
A game based on the TV series called &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; was released for the Japanese Nintendo Family Computer console in 1985 by video game company Namco.

Years later Bandai released &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; 3D shooting game in October 2003 in Japan for the Sony PlayStation 2 console. This game had levels based in both the TV series and its movie adaptation.

More recently, a new 3D shooting game called &quot;Macross Ace Frontier&quot; included several elements from the original series. It was developed by Artdink for the Sony PSP and was released in 2008.

==Reception and legacy==
In the &quot;Anime Encyclopedia&quot;, authors Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy called the series &quot;One of the three unassailable pillars of anime sci-fi, pioneering the tripartite winning formula of songs, battling robot-planes and tense relationships.&quot;

&quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; was the basis for two different animated franchises, &quot;Macross&quot; in Japan and &quot;Robotech&quot; in North America. In Japan, &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; spawned an animated film adaptation, &quot;&quot; (1984), and a number of sequels, including &quot;Macross Plus&quot; (1994), &quot;Macross 7&quot; (1994), &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; (2007) and &quot;Macross Delta&quot; (2015). In North America, &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; was adapted into the first saga of the &quot;Robotech&quot; television series (19851986), called &quot;The Macross Saga&quot;, which spawned the &quot;Robotech&quot; franchise. &quot;Robotech&quot; was influential in the Western world, helping to introduce the anime medium to North America. In 1996, &quot;Hyper&quot; magazine reviewed &quot;The Macross Saga&quot;, rating it 10 out of 10.

&quot;Macross&quot; popularized the concept of transforming mecha, which can transform between a standard vehicle (such as a fighter plane or transport truck) and a fighting mecha robot. Shōji Kawamori introduced the concept with &quot;Diaclone&quot; in 1980 and then popularized it with &quot;Macross&quot;. Kawamori then went on to design transforming mecha for &quot;Transformers&quot; (1986). The transforming mecha concept became popular in the mid-1980s, with &quot;Macross: Do You Remember Love?&quot; and &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; (1985) in Japan, and with &quot;Robotech&quot; and &quot;Transformers&quot; in the West. &quot;Transformers&quot; went on to influence the Hollywood movie industry.

In contrast to earlier mecha anime which focused on combatants, &quot;Macross&quot; portrayed a mecha conflict from the perspective of non-combatant civilians, such as the fictional singer Lynn Minmay. She went on to become the first virtual idol. Voiced by Mari Iijima, Minmay was the first fictional idol singer to garner major real-world success, with the theme song &quot;Do You Remember Love?&quot; (from the film &quot;Macross: Do You Remember Love?&quot;) reaching number seven on the Oricon music charts in Japan. This was later further explored in &quot;Macross Plus&quot; with the virtual idol Sharon Apple, an artificial intelligence (AI) computer program who takes the form of an intergalactic pop star, and in &quot;Macross 7&quot; with the virtual band Fire Bomber who became a commercial success and spawned multiple CDs released in Japan. &quot;Macross&quot; set the template for later virtual idols in the early 21st century, such as Hatsune Miku and Kizuna AI.

Another innovative character concept in &quot;Macross&quot; was the role of Misa Hayase, who was one of the main commanders of the Macross battleship. She was the boss and commanding officer of the fighter pilot protagonist Hikaru Ichijyo, and later his love interest. This was a scenario Kawamori came up with which he had not seen in any Hollywood movies before. A similar scenario, however, later appeared in the Hollywood movie &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986). According to Kawamori, &quot;Many people pointed out that later films like &quot;Top Gun&quot; copied that idea and setting, as well as including the combination of many songs and fighters too.&quot;

For the video game &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot;, motion and voice actor Reuben Langdon was told to be cockier than his younger persona, albeit more mature. Despite the staff&#x27;s concerns for the difficulties of such a portrayal, Langdon had no issues after choosing Roy Focker from &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; as his character model and noting he had almost the same age as Dante during the production of the game.

<text>Colony is a town in Cullman County, Alabama, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 268, down from 385 in 2000. Colony is a historically African-American town. In its early days it was a haven for African Americans in the Deep South. It incorporated in 1981.

==Geography==
Colony is located in southern Cullman County at (33.945011, -86.899465), about north of the Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River. The town is located along Alabama State Route 91, approximately one mile west of Interstate 65.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which , or 0.40%, is water.

==History==
Colony most likely was originally established soon after the emancipation of slaves after the Civil War, during Reconstruction. It is believed that the original settlers of the town were most likely freed slaves from Baltimore, Alabama. It is the only African American community in Cullman County, which was founded in 1873, and was considered a safe haven for Blacks at a time when other cities with white majorities were considered dangerous for Blacks, and referred to as &#x27;sundown&#x27; cities because after sundown Blacks were in danger there. Those that originally settled there were given land as compensation for being slaves, with over 8,000 acres eventually cultivated as farm land.

In the early days of Colony it was not considered part of Cullman County because the freed Blacks were not welcome. But when coal mines began to open adjacent to Colony the leaders of Cullman County wanted to incorporate the coal mines into the county for economic reasons, and were forced to add Colony as well. Colony was incorporated as a town in 1981 during the tenure of Mayor Earlene Johnson. The town celebrates Colony Day annually in August.

<text>Cullman is the largest city and county seat of Cullman County, Alabama, United States. It is located along Interstate 65, about north of Birmingham and about south of Huntsville. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 18,213, with an estimated population of 19,913 in 2023.

==History==
Before the arrival of American settlers, the area that today includes Cullman was originally in the territory of the Cherokee Nation. The region was traversed by a trail known as the Black Warrior&#x27;s Path, which led from the Tennessee River near the present location of Florence, Alabama, to a point on the Black Warrior River south of Cullman. This trail figured significantly in Cherokee history, and it featured prominently in the American Indian Wars prior to the establishment of the state of Alabama and the relocation of several American Indian tribes, including the Creek people westward along the Trail of Tears. During the Creek War in 1813, General Andrew Jackson of the U.S. Army dispatched a contingent of troops down the trail, one of which included the frontiersman Davy Crockett.

In the 1820s and the 1830s, two toll roads were built linking the Tennessee Valley to present-day Birmingham. In 1822, Abraham Stout was given a charter by the Alabama Legislature to open and turnpike a road beginning from Gandy&#x27;s Cove in Morgan County to the ghost town of Baltimore on the Mulberry Fork near Colony. The road passed near present-day Vinemont through Cullman, Good Hope, and down the current Interstate 65 corridor to the Mulberry Fork. The road was later extended to Elyton (Birmingham) in 1827. It then became known as Stout&#x27;s Road. Mace Thomas Payne Brindley was given a charter in 1833 to turnpike two roads, one running between Blount Springs to Somerville by way of his homestead in present-day Simcoe, and the second road passing west of Hanceville and east of Downtown Cullman to join Stout&#x27;s Road north of the city. What later became the Brindley Turnpike became an extension of Stout&#x27;s Road to Decatur. Cullman later became located between the juncture of the two roads, and they predated the corridor of U.S. Route 31.

During the Civil War, the future location of Cullman was the site of the minor Battle of Day&#x27;s Gap. On April 30, 1863, Union forces under the command of Colonel Abel Streight won a victory over forces under Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest. This battle was part of a campaign and chase known collectively as Streight&#x27;s Raid. Although Streight got the upper hand in this battle, Forrest would have the last laugh. In one of the more humorous moments of the war, Streight sought a truce and negotiations with Forrest in present-day Cherokee County near present-day Gaylesville. Although Streight&#x27;s force was larger than Forrest&#x27;s, while the two were negotiating, Forrest had his troops march repeatedly in a circuitous route past the site of the talks. Thinking himself to be badly outnumbered, Streight surrendered to Forrest.
Cullman itself was founded in 1873 by Colonel John G. Cullmann, a German immigrant. Cullmann had been an advocate of democratic reforms in his native Bavaria, having fought and acquired his honorific title &quot;Colonel&quot; during the Revolutions of 1848–49. After the failure of the revolution, Cullmann found himself in financial ruin. In the years to follow, he would try to re-establish himself in business, but after several setbacks, including a great financial loss in the First Schleswig War, he would remain unsuccessful. As time went on and Prussia, under King Wilhelm I and his Minister President Otto von Bismarck, began to exert more influence in the German region (eventually unifying Germany under Prussian rule in 1871), Cullmann began to believe that his political ideals were fundamentally incompatible with those of the German Government. As a result, he decided to emigrate from his homeland. Settling first in London due to fears that he would be forced to join in the ongoing American Civil War, Cullmann eventually came to America in 1865. He moved to Alabama in 1871 and, in 1873, negotiated an agreement to act as agent for a tract of land in size, owned by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company, on which he established a colony for German immigrants.

Five German families moved to the area in March 1873; in 1874, the town was incorporated and named after Colonel Cullmann (with the town name being Americanized to &#x27;Cullman&#x27; with one &#x27;n&#x27;). Over the next 20 years, Cullmann encouraged around 100,000 Germans to immigrate to the United States, with many settling in the Cullman area. Cullmann drew on his military engineering training in laying out and planning the town. During this period, Cullman underwent considerable growth. German continued to be widely spoken, and Cullmann himself was the publisher of a German-language newspaper. When Cullmann died in 1895, at the age of 72, his funeral was marked by the attendance of Governor William C. Oates. The site Cullmann selected for his headquarters is now his gravesite.

German immigrants also founded St. Bernard&#x27;s Monastery, on the grounds of which is the Ave Maria Grotto, containing 125 miniature reproductions of some of the most famous religious structures of the world. It is Cullman&#x27;s principal tourist attraction.

From the 1890s until the 1950s, Cullman was a sundown town, where African Americans were not allowed to live. Tom Drake, a former Alabama state legislator and Speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives, stated that &quot;there used to be signs on the railroad track, at the county line and all that. &#x27;Nigger, don&#x27;t let the sun set on your head in Cullman County.&#x27;&quot; The need for Black day laborers in Cullman subsequently led to a rise in population of Colony, Alabama, a safe haven for the discriminated.

For many years Cullman was a college town, with Saint Bernard College serving as the home of several hundred students. In the mid-1970s, St. Bernard briefly merged with Sacred Heart College (a two-year Benedictine women&#x27;s college), to become Southern Benedictine College. That college closed in 1979, and it now operates as St. Bernard Preparatory School, serving grades 9–12. The former site of Sacred Heart College is now the Sacred Heart Monastery, which serves as a retreat center operated by the Benedictine Sisters of Sacred Heart Monastery.

During the 20th century, Cullman developed a more diverse economy, including several manufacturing and distribution facilities. The City of Cullman regularly ranks as a top &#x27;micropolitan&#x27; city in the nation.

Cullman gained national attention in early 2008, when a special election was held to fill a vacancy in the Alabama House of Representatives. The district that included Cullman elected James C. Fields, an African American, in that special election.

Cullman&#x27;s German heritage was repressed during World War I and World War II, while the United States was fighting Germany. This was reversed in the 1970s, with renewed interest in the city&#x27;s history and heritage. Today, Cullman holds an annual Oktoberfest. An honorary &quot;Bürgermeister&quot; is elected for each Oktoberfest. For many years the Oktoberfest did not include alcohol because Cullman was dry, but starting in 2011 the Oktoberfest was able to offer beer.

==Geography==
Cullman is located on top of the Brindley Mountain plateau at (34.1764162, -86.8403857).

<text>Daleville is a city in Dale County, Alabama, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 5,295, up from 4,653 in 2000. It is part of the Ozark Micropolitan Statistical Area. The city&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Gateway to Fort Rucker&quot;, as this U.S. Army post is located just north of town. Cairns Army Airfield is located to the south of Daleville on the road to nearby Clayhatchee.

==History==
Daleville, originally known as &quot;Dale&#x27;s Court House&quot;, was founded in 1827 by veterans of the Creek Indian War who had settled in Dale County following that conflict. It was established as the original county seat of Dale County in 1827 but lost that honor when Coffee County split from Dale in 1841, at which time the seat was moved first to Newton, and then later to Ozark in 1870, where it remains today.

The name of Daleville was adopted in 1848. Daleville voted to incorporate in 1912, but rescinded it in 1916. It later voted for incorporation in 1958.

Residents of the town formed portions of two regiments of the Confederate States Army during the U.S. Civil War: the 15th Alabama Infantry, famed for charging the 20th Maine on Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg, and the 33rd Alabama Infantry. In the latter regiment, Company &quot;G&quot;, called the &quot;Daleville Blues&quot;, was recruited entirely from Daleville. Several men from this company were killed in a freak train derailment on November 4, 1862, near Cleveland, Tennessee; the remainder would fight with the rest of the 33rd in the Confederate Army of Tennessee until the final surrender in 1865.

Long a tiny farming community, Daleville saw significant expansion during the mid-to-late twentieth century with the establishment and enlargement of Fort Novosel, the U.S. Army&#x27;s primary aviation training post. Douglas Brown, a former mayor of Ozark, teamed up with two Georgia businessmen, L.C. Hall and Bob Culpepper, to develop the city. Securing a 1.5 million dollar loan, the trio purchased of land in Daleville, constructed a lagoon sewer system and began to build the town house by house, shopping center by shopping center. Numerous military personnel then made their homes in the community, and many elected to stay after their retirement or otherwise completing their service obligation. This large military presence gives the town a more cosmopolitan populace than other area towns farther away from the base.

Daleville was the victim of an F1 tornado on November 24, 2001, part of the Arkansas-Mississippi-Alabama tornado outbreak that occurred on November 23 and 24 of that year. Two restaurants and two industrial buildings were destroyed; a local lounge suffered severe damage as well. Also damaged were maintenance buildings, one aircraft, 25 businesses, a church, gas station, two supermarkets, a bank and several homes. 25 people inside the lounge were injured, but no fatalities were reported.

==Geography==

<text>Dothan is a city in and the county seat of Houston County in the U.S. state of Alabama. A slight portion of the city extends into Dale and Henry counties. It had a population of 71,072 at the 2020 census, making it Alabama&#x27;s eighth-largest city by population and the 5th largest in Alabama by total area. It is near the state&#x27;s southeastern corner, about west of Georgia and north of Florida. It is named after the biblical city where Joseph&#x27;s brothers threw him into a cistern and sold him into slavery in Egypt.

Dothan is the principal city of the Dothan, Alabama metropolitan area, which encompasses all of Geneva, Henry, and Houston counties; the small portion in Dale County is part of the Ozark Micropolitan Statistical Area. Together they form the Dothan-Ozark Combined Statistical Area. Coffee County and its Enterprise micropolitan area was originally combined as a statistical area with both Dothan and Ozark as well, but is now split off as its own statistical area by the US Census Bureau. Together they form the Alabama portion of the Wiregrass region, of which Dothan is that portion&#x27;s largest city. The combined population of the entire Dothan metropolitan area in 2020 was 151,007. The city is the main transportation and commercial hub for a significant part of southeastern Alabama, southwest Georgia, and nearby portions of the Florida Panhandle. Since approximately one-fourth of the U.S. peanut crop is produced nearby, much of it processed in the city, Dothan is known as &quot;The Peanut Capital of the World&quot;. It also hosts the annual National Peanut Festival at the Peanut Festival Fairgrounds.

==History==
===Earliest years===
Between 1763 and 1783, the region that is now Dothan was part of the colony of British West Florida. European-American settlers moving through the area during the late 18th and early 19th centuries discovered the Indian spring, naming it &quot;Poplar Head&quot;. Most felt that the sandy soil common to this region would be unsuitable for farming, so they moved on.

A crude stockade was constructed on the Barber Plantation, where settlers could take refuge whenever they felt threatened. Gradually the area received more white settlers. This fort disappeared by the 1840s, after the end of the Indian Wars in Alabama and Indian Removal in the 1830s, when most members of the Five Civilized Tribes were forcibly taken to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Those members of the tribe who stayed in the southeast were considered to have given up their tribal memberships and became state and U.S. citizens.

The first permanent white settlers consisted of nine families who moved into the area during the early 1830s to harvest the abundant timber. Their settlement, named Poplar Head after the spring, failed to thrive. It was all but abandoned by the time of the Civil War. After the war, a local Pony Express route was founded; together with other developments during the Reconstruction Era, the town began to grow. On November 11, 1885, the citizens voted to incorporate, naming their new city Dothan at the suggestion of a local clergyman after discovering that &quot;Poplar Head&quot; was already registered with the U.S. post office for a town in northern Alabama.

===Civil unrest===
On October 12, 1889, Dothan was the scene of a deadly altercation resulting from a dispute over a tax levied on wagons operating within city limits. Local farmers opposed the levy and united in a body called the &quot;Farmers Alliance&quot;. The arrest of some of the alliance&#x27;s men led to a riot that left two men dead and others seriously wounded. Chief of Police Tobe Domingus was found guilty of murder and sentenced to ten years in prison. Appeals to the Alabama Supreme Court resulted in a new trial, and Domingus was acquitted.

===Expansion and growth===

In 1893, Dothan secured a stop on the first railroad to be built in the region. This development brought new prosperity and growth, as local farmers had a means to market and transport their produce. The pine forests were harvested for turpentine and wood, which was transformed into ship masts, lumber and other wood products. As the pines were cut and land subsequently cleared, cotton was cultivated as a staple of the local economy. The crops were devastated by the boll weevil in the early 1900s.

Farmers turned to peanut production, which was successful and brought financial gain to the city. It became a hub for the production and transport of peanuts and peanut-related products. Today, one-quarter of the U.S. peanut crop is harvested within of Dothan.

<doc id="104634" wikidata="Q1292067" url="?curid=104634" title="Fort Novosel">
<text>Fort Novosel (formerly Fort Rucker) is a United States Army post located primarily in Dale County, Alabama, United States. It is named in honor of Chief Warrant Officer Michael J. Novosel, an Army aviator and Medal of Honor recipient. It was previously named for a Civil War officer, Confederate Colonel Edmund Rucker. The post is the primary flight training installation for U.S. Army Aviators and is home to the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) and the United States Army Aviation Museum. Small sections of the post also lie in Coffee, Geneva, and Houston counties. Part of the Dale County section of the base is a census-designated place; its population was 4,636 at the 2010 census.

The main post has entrances from three bordering cities, Daleville, Ozark and Enterprise. In the years before the September 11, 2001 attacks, the main post (except airfields and other restricted areas) was an open post with unmanned gates allowing civilians to drive through. Following the attacks, this policy was changed, and the post is now closed to unauthorized traffic and visitors.

It was one of the U.S. Army installations named for Confederate soldiers that was recommended for renaming by The Naming Commission. Their recommendation was that the post be renamed Fort Novosel. On 5 January 2023 William A. LaPlante, U.S. under-secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment (USD (A&amp;S)) directed the full implementation of the recommendations of the Naming Commission, DoD-wide. The post was redesignated Fort Novosel on 10 April 2023.

== Military facilities ==

The U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence is the dominant military facility at Fort Novosel. Training, doctrine, and testing are all key parts of the center&#x27;s mission to develop Army Aviation&#x27;s capabilities. All Army Aviation training has been undertaken at Fort Novosel since 1973, as well as training of United States Air Force (USAF) and ally helicopter pilots and air crew. The center was home to the U.S. Army Aviation Technical Test Center (ATTC), which conducts developmental aircraft testing for Army Aviation. In 2005, as part of the Base Re-alignment and Closure (BRAC) decision, ATTC was moved north to Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, and combined with the Redstone Technical Test Center to form the Redstone Test Center. The United States Army Operational Test and Evaluation Command&#x27;s Test and Evaluation Coordination Office and TH-67 Creek primary and instrument training are both located at Cairns Army Airfield. The last TH-67 was retired in 2021 as the Army moved to the Eurocopter UH-72 Lakota as its trainer aircraft.

Operational units on the post include the 1st Aviation Brigade and the 110th Aviation Brigade handling Army Aviation training, and the USAF 23d Flying Training Squadron for the training of Air Force helicopter pilots and air crew.

The 110th Aviation Brigade consists of four battalions using three different sites. 1st Battalion, 11th Aviation Regiment, operates and manages air traffic control services for USAACe/Fort Novosel and the National Airspace System. 1st Battalion, 13th Aviation Regiment trains future air traffic controllers and aviation operations specialists who have recently graduated United States Army Basic Training, or are transferring from another Military Occupational Specialty. 1st Battalion, 14th Aviation Regiment operates from Hanchey Army Heliport and conducts graduate level training using the AH-64E Apache Longbow helicopters. 1st Battalion, 212th Aviation Regiment operates from Lowe Army Heliport and Shell Army Heliport and conducts combat and night operational training, using the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. 1st Battalion, 223d Aviation Regiment operates from Cairns Army Airfield and Shell Army Heliport flying the Eurocopter UH-72 Lakota for introductory helicopter pilot training, and Knox Army Heliport for training pilots who fly the CH-47 Chinook helicopter.

Additionally, due to the large number of warrant officers stationed there, the Warrant Officer Candidate School and Warrant Officer Career College are both located at Fort Novosel. Aviation branched warrant officers remain at Fort Novosel to complete flight training and the Aviation Warrant Officer Basic Course. Upon completion of their training, aviation warrant officers receive the Army Aviator Badge.

Support and other facilities at Fort Novosel include the Lyster Army Health Clinic, United States Army Aeromedical Research Lab, United States Army School of Aviation Medicine, United States Army Combat Readiness/Safety Center and Army Aviation Museum.

== History ==
The original name of the post was Ozark Triangular Division Camp, but before the camp was officially opened during World War II on 1 May 1942, the War Department named it Camp Rucker. The post was named in honor of Colonel Edmund W. Rucker, a Civil War Confederate officer, who was given the honorary title of &quot;General,&quot; and who became an industrial leader in Birmingham after the war.
Fort Novosel (situated on of sub-marginal farmland, and formerly a wildlife refuge) was opened on 1 May 1942 as &quot;Camp Rucker&quot;. It had quarters for 3,280 officers and 39,461 enlisted personnel.

In September 1942, 1,259 additional acres south of Daleville were acquired to construct an airfield to support the training camp. It was known as Ozark Army Airfield until January 1959, when the name was changed to Cairns Army Airfield. The first troops to train at Camp Rucker were those of the 81st Infantry Division; the 81st Division left Rucker for action in the Pacific Theater in March 1943. Three other infantry divisions received training at Camp Rucker during the war—the 35th, the 98th, and the 66th. The 66th (Panther) Division was the last division to train at the post during WW II, and left for the European Theater in October 1944.

Camp Rucker was also used to train dozens of units of less than division size; these included tank, infantry replacement, and Women&#x27;s Army Corps units. During the latter part of World War II, several hundred German and a few Italian prisoners of war were housed in stockades near the railroad east of the warehouse area, on the southern edge of the post. The 91st Infantry Division was sent to Camp Rucker at the war&#x27;s end, inactivating in December 1945.

Camp Rucker was inactive from March 1946 until August 1950. It was reopened during the Korean War. The Minnesota Army National Guard&#x27;s 47th Infantry Division was mobilized and sent to Camp Rucker in the fall of 1950; the division provided cadre that would conduct basic training of soldiers, who would later on, be sent as replacements to units in Korea. The 47th Infantry Division would remain at Camp Rucker throughout the war. After another short deactivation, it reopened and expanded when it became a helicopter training base. The name was changed to &quot;Fort Rucker&quot; in October 1955.

The Hanchey Army Airfield became the home of the Department of Rotary Wing Training of the Army Aviation School on 5 October 1959, marking the first time the department was centralized.

Fort Rucker suffered damage from three significant tornadoes within two years in 1972 and 1973. The first, rated F2, struck on 13 January 1972. It damaged buildings and helicopters on the post and devastated two nearby trailer parks, killing four people and injuring 88, all army dependents. An F3 tornado struck the post on 29 December 1973, causing minor damage to residences and striking a tank storage area. Most of the significant damage from this storm was in the Enterprise area. A second F3 tornado hit a day later, heavily damaging 30 government and residential buildings at Fort Rucker, 5 of which were destroyed. Twenty-three people were injured.

=== Renaming ===

The 2021 National Defense Authorization Act calls for the establishment of an eight-person committee to develop a plan to remove all names, symbols, displays, and monuments that honor or commemorate the Confederacy from all Department of Defense assets, including the former Fort Rucker. In 2021, the family of Hal Moore started a petition to rename the fort in honor of Benjamin O. Davis Jr., the first black brigadier general in the USAF.

The Naming Commission later recommended that the fort be renamed in honor of Chief Warrant Officer Michael J. Novosel, an Army aviator. The post was officially renamed on 10 April 2023.

<text>Newton is a town in Dale County, Alabama, United States. At the 2010 census its population was 1,511. Once the county seat of Dale County, Newton lost this distinction to nearby Ozark in 1870, and is now a small farming community. It incorporated in 1887. The city currently forms a part of the Ozark micropolitan statistical area.

==Geography==
Newton is located at 31°21′N 85°36′W (31.344,-85.593).

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.21%) is water.

The Choctawhatchee River flows just to the north and west of Newton. At one time this waterway was navigable by steamboat from its mouth in Choctawhatchee Bay, Florida all the way to Newton.

Alabama State Route 123 and Alabama State Route 134 both pass through Newton.

==History==

Newton was founded in 1843 after the formation of Coffee County from Dale County&#x27;s western half, which rendered the original county seat of Daleville off-center. The town was a scene for Confederate recruiting during the Civil War, and was the site of a battle in March 1865 between local Home Guard troops and elements of the 1st Florida Cavalry (US) operating out of Florida. The Federals were led by Joseph Sanders, a Dale County resident who had previously been a captain in the 31st Georgia Infantry, but had later switched sides and joined the Federals. Seeking to burn the county courthouse, the attackers were repulsed when local troops ambushed their column as they entered the town. This event is commemorated by a monument located in downtown Newton, and by annual re-enactments.

On December 3, 1864, a local Methodist minister named Bill Sketoe was lynched just north of Newton by local Home Guardsmen led by Captain Joseph Brear. Since Sketoe was tall, a hole had to be dug beneath his feet to accommodate his large frame. Local legend insists that &quot;the hole that won&#x27;t stay filled&quot; never vanished—even after being filled in numerous times during the years that followed. Though covered in 1979 by a new bridge and tons of rip-rap, &quot;Sketoe&#x27;s hole&quot; remains a local attraction, and was documented by Alabama writer Kathryn Tucker Windham in &quot;13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey&quot;. A monument to Sketoe was dedicated near the hanging site in 2006, and the local museum displays items of Sketoe memorabilia.

Following a fire which destroyed the courthouse in March 1869, and the formation of Geneva County in 1870 from the southern third of Dale and Coffee Counties, voters relocated the county seat to Ozark, which was more centralized.

&quot;The Southern Star&quot;, one of the oldest newspapers in the Wiregrass area, was first published in Newton in 1867. It later relocated to Ozark, where it continues to be published today. Newton remained a port for river boats on the nearby Choctawhatchee, until the railroad arrived in 1890. The Baptist Collegiate Institute operated in the city from 1898 to 1929; its main building now houses the city&#x27;s public library.

<text>Christian Johann Heinrich Heine (; ; born Harry Heine; 13 December 1797 – 17 February 1856) was a German poet, writer and literary critic. He is best known outside Germany for his early lyric poetry, which was set to music in the form of &quot;Lieder&quot; (art songs) by composers such as Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert. 

Heine&#x27;s later verse and prose are distinguished by their satirical wit and irony. He is considered a member of the Young Germany movement. His radical political views led to many of his works being banned by German authorities—which, however, only added to his fame. He spent the last 25 years of his life as an expatriate in Paris.

==Early life==

===Childhood and youth===

Heine was born on 13 December 1797, in Düsseldorf, in what was then the Duchy of Berg, into a Jewish family. He was called &quot;Harry&quot; in childhood but became known as &quot;Heinrich&quot; after his conversion to Lutheran Christianity in 1825. Heine&#x27;s father, (1764–1828), was a textile merchant. His mother Peira, née van Geldern (known as &quot;Betty&quot; or ) (1771–1859) was daughter of physician (1726–1795).

Heinrich was the eldest of four children. He had a sister, Charlotte (later ) (1800–1899), who was married merchant (1790–1866), and two brothers, Gustav (1812–1886), later Baron Heine-Geldern and publisher of the Viennese newspaper &quot;&quot;, and Maximilian (1807–1879), who became a physician in Saint Petersburg. Heine was a third cousin once removed of philosopher and economist Karl Marx (1818–1883), also born to a German Jewish family in the Rhineland, with whom he became a frequent correspondent in later life.

Düsseldorf at the time was a town with a population of around 16,000. The French Revolution and subsequent Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars involving Germany complicated Düsseldorf&#x27;s political history during Heine&#x27;s childhood. It had been the capital of the Duchy of Jülich-Berg, but was under French occupation at the time of his birth. It then passed to the Elector of Bavaria before being ceded to Napoleon in 1806, who turned it into the capital of the Grand Duchy of Berg, one of three French states he established in Germany. It was first ruled by Joachim Murat, then by Napoleon himself. Upon Napoleon&#x27;s downfall in 1815 it became part of Prussia.

Thus Heine&#x27;s formative years were spent under French influence. The adult Heine would always be devoted to the French for introducing the Napoleonic Code and trial by jury. He glossed over the negative aspects of French rule in Berg: heavy taxation, conscription, and economic depression brought about by the Continental Blockade, which may have contributed to his father&#x27;s bankruptcy. Heine greatly admired Napoleon as the promoter of revolutionary ideals of liberty and equality and loathed the political atmosphere in Germany after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, marked by the conservative policies of Austrian chancellor Klemens von Metternich, who attempted to reverse the effects of the French Revolution.

Heine&#x27;s parents were not particularly devout. They sent him as a young child to a Jewish school where he learned a smattering of Hebrew, but thereafter he attended Catholic schools. Here he learned French, which became his second language – although he always spoke it with a German accent. He also acquired a lifelong love for Rhenish folklore.

In 1814 Heine went to a business school in Düsseldorf where he learned to read English, the commercial language of the time. The most successful member of the Heine family was his uncle Salomon Heine, a millionaire banker in Hamburg. In 1816 Heine moved to Hamburg to become an apprentice at Heckscher &amp; Co, his uncle&#x27;s bank, but displayed little aptitude for business. He learned to hate Hamburg, with its commercial ethos, but it would become one of the poles of his life alongside Paris.

When he was 18 Heine almost certainly had an unrequited love for his cousin Amalie, Salomon&#x27;s daughter. Whether he then transferred his affections, equally unsuccessfully to her sister Therese is unknown. This period in Heine&#x27;s life is not clear but it seems that his father&#x27;s business deteriorated, making Samson Heine effectively the ward of his brother Salomon.

===Universities===
Salomon realised that his nephew had no talent for trade, and it was decided that Heine should enter law. So, in 1819, Heine went to the University of Bonn, then in Prussia. Political life in Germany was divided between conservatives and liberals. The conservatives, who were in power, wanted to restore things to the way they were before the French Revolution. They were against German unification because they felt a united Germany might fall victim to revolutionary ideas. Most German states were absolutist monarchies with a censored press. The opponents of the conservatives, the liberals, wanted to replace absolutism with representative, constitutional government, equality before the law and a free press. 

At the University of Bonn, liberal students were at war with the conservative authorities. Heine was a radical liberal and one of the first things he did after his arrival was to take part in a parade which violated the Carlsbad Decrees, a series of measures introduced by Metternich to suppress liberal political activity.

Heine was more interested in studying history and literature than law. The university had engaged the famous literary critic and thinker August Wilhelm Schlegel as a lecturer and Heine heard him talk about the and Romanticism. Though he would later mock Schlegel, Heine found in him a sympathetic critic for his early verses. Heine began to acquire a reputation as a poet at Bonn. He also wrote two tragedies, &quot;Almansor&quot; and &quot;William Ratcliff&quot;, but they had little success in the theatre.

After a year at Bonn, Heine left to continue his law studies at the University of Göttingen. Heine hated the town. It was part of Hanover, then also rulers of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the power Heine blamed for bringing Napoleon down. 

Here the poet experienced an aristocratic snobbery absent elsewhere. He hated law as the Historical School of law he had to study was used to bolster the reactionary form of government he opposed. Other events conspired to make Heine loathe this period of his life: he was expelled from a student fraternity due to anti-Semitism, and he heard the news that his cousin Amalie had become engaged. When Heine challenged another student, Wiebel, to a duel, the first of ten known incidents throughout his life, the authorities stepped in and he was suspended from the university for six months. His uncle then decided to send him to the University of Berlin.
Heine arrived in Berlin in March 1821. It was the biggest, most cosmopolitan city he had ever visited, with its population of about 200,000. The university gave Heine access to notable cultural figures as lecturers: the Sanskritist Franz Bopp and the Homer critic F. A. Wolf, who inspired Heine&#x27;s lifelong love of Aristophanes. Most important was the philosopher Hegel, whose influence on Heine is hard to gauge. He probably gave Heine and other young students the idea that history had a meaning which could be seen as progressive. Heine also made valuable acquaintances in Berlin, notably the liberal Karl August Varnhagen and his Jewish wife Rahel, who held a leading salon.

Another friend was the satirist Karl Immermann, who had praised Heine&#x27;s first verse collection, &quot;Gedichte&quot;, when it appeared in December 1821. During his time in Berlin Heine also joined the &quot;Verein für Cultur und Wissenschaft der Juden&quot;, a society which attempted to achieve a balance between the Jewish faith and modernity. Since Heine was not very religious in outlook he soon lost interest, but he also began to investigate Jewish history. He was particularly drawn to the Spanish Jews of the Middle Ages. In 1824 Heine began a historical novel, &quot;Der Rabbi von Bacherach&quot;, which he never finished.

In May 1823 Heine left Berlin for good and joined his family at their new home in Lüneburg. Here he began to write the poems of the cycle &quot;Die Heimkehr&quot; (&quot;The Homecoming&quot;). He returned to Göttingen where he was again bored by the law. In September 1824 he decided to take a break and set off on a trip through the Harz mountains. On his return he started writing an account of it, &quot;Die Harzreise&quot;.

On 28 June 1825 Heine was baptized as an Evangelical Lutheran Christian in Heiligenstadt. The Prussian government had been gradually restoring discrimination against Jews. In 1822 it introduced a law excluding Jews from academic posts and Heine had ambitions for a university career. As Heine said in self-justification, his conversion was &quot;the ticket of admission into European culture&quot;. In any event, Heine&#x27;s conversion, which was reluctant, never brought him any benefits in his career. A quarter of a century later, he declared: &quot;I make no secret of my Judaism, to which I have not returned, because I never left it.&quot;

===Julius Campe and first literary successes===
Heine now had to search for a job. He was only really suited to writing but it was extremely difficult to be a professional writer in Germany. The market for literary works was small and it was only possible to make a living by writing virtually non-stop. Heine was incapable of doing this so he never had enough money to cover his expenses. Before finding work, Heine visited the North Sea resort of Norderney which inspired the free verse poems of his cycle &quot;Die Nordsee&quot;.
In Hamburg one evening in January 1826 Heine met , who would be his chief publisher for the rest of his life. Their stormy relationship has been compared to a marriage. Campe was a liberal who published as many dissident authors as he could. He had developed various techniques for evading the authorities. The laws of the time stated that any book under 320 pages had to be submitted to censorship. The authorities thought long books would cause little trouble as they were unpopular. One way around censorship was to publish dissident works in large print to increase the number of pages beyond 320.

The censorship in Hamburg was relatively lax but Campe had to worry about Prussia, the largest German state and largest market for books. It was estimated that one-third of the German readership was Prussian. Initially, any book which had passed the censor in a German state was able to be sold in any of the other states, but in 1834 this loophole was closed. Campe was reluctant to publish uncensored books as he had bad experiences with print runs being confiscated. Heine resisted all censorship; this issue became a bone of contention between the two.

However, the relationship between author and publisher started well: Campe published the first volume of &quot;Reisebilder&quot; (&quot;Travel Pictures&quot;) in May 1826. This volume included &quot;Die Harzreise&quot;, which marked a new style of German travel-writing, mixing Romantic descriptions of nature with satire. Heine&#x27;s &quot;&quot; followed in 1827. This was a collection of already published poems. No one expected it to become one of the most popular books of German verse ever published, and sales were slow to start with, picking up when composers began setting Heine&#x27;s poems as Lieder. For example, the poem &quot;Allnächtlich im Traume&quot; was set to music by Robert Schumann and Felix Mendelssohn. It contains the ironic disillusionment typical of Heine:
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;
Allnächtlich im Traume seh ich dich,
Und sehe dich freundlich grüßen,
Und laut aufweinend stürz ich mich
Zu deinen süßen Füßen.

Du siehst mich an wehmütiglich,
Und schüttelst das blonde Köpfchen;
Aus deinen Augen schleichen sich
Die Perlentränentröpfchen.

Du sagst mir heimlich ein leises Wort,
Und gibst mir den Strauß von Zypressen.
Ich wache auf, und der Strauß ist fort,
Und das Wort hab ich vergessen.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;
Nightly I see you in dreams – you speak,
With kindliness sincerest,
I throw myself, weeping aloud and weak
At your sweet feet, my dearest.

You look at me with wistful woe,
And shake your golden curls;
And stealing from your eyes there flow
The teardrops like to pearls.

You breathe in my ear a secret word,
A garland of cypress for token.
I wake; it is gone; the dream is blurred,
And forgotten the word that was spoken.
(Poetic translation by Hal Draper)&lt;/poem&gt;
Starting from the mid-1820s, Heine distanced himself from Romanticism by adding irony, sarcasm, and satire into his poetry, and making fun of the sentimental-romantic awe of nature and of figures of speech in contemporary poetry and literature. An example are these lines:

&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;
Das Fräulein stand am Meere
Und seufzte lang und bang. 
Es rührte sie so sehre 
der Sonnenuntergang.

Mein Fräulein! Sein sie munter,
Das ist ein altes Stück; 
Hier vorne geht sie unter 
Und kehrt von hinten zurück.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;
A mistress stood by the sea
sighing long and anxiously.
She was so deeply stirred
By the setting sun

My Fräulein!, be gay,
This is an old play;
ahead of you it sets
And from behind it returns.&lt;/poem&gt;
The blue flower of Novalis, &quot;symbol for the Romantic movement&quot;, also received withering treatment from Heine during this period, as illustrated by the following quatrains from &quot;Lyrisches Intermezzo&quot;:

&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Am Kreuzweg wird begraben
Wer selber brachte sich um;
dort wächst eine blaue Blume,
Die Armesünderblum&#x27;.

Am Kreuzweg stand ich und seufzte;
Die Nacht war kalt und stumm.
Im Mondschein bewegte sich langsam
Die Armesünderblum&#x27;.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;At the cross-road will be buried
He who killed himself;
There grows a blue flower,
Suicide’s flower.

I stood at the cross-road and sighed
The night was cold and mute.
By the light of the moon moved slowly
Suicide’s flower.&lt;/poem&gt;
Heine became increasingly critical of despotism and reactionary chauvinism in Germany, of nobility and clerics but also what he viewed as “narrow mindedness” of ordinary people and of the rising German form of nationalism, especially in contrast to the French and the revolution. Nevertheless, he made a point of stressing his love for his Fatherland:

Plant the black, red, gold banner at the summit of the German idea, make it the standard of free mankind, and I will shed my dear heart&#x27;s blood for it. Rest assured, I love the Fatherland just as much as you do.
===Travel and the Platen affair===

The first volume of travel writings was such a success that Campe pressed Heine for another. &quot;Reisebilder II&quot; appeared in April 1827. It contains the second cycle of North Sea poems, a prose essay on the North Sea as well as a new work, &quot;Ideen: Das Buch Le Grand&quot;, which contains the following satire on German censorship:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em;&quot;&gt;
The German Censors  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——
——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——
——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——
——  ——  ——  ——  ——    idiots    ——  ——
——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——  ——
——  ——  ——  ——  ——&lt;/poem&gt;

Heine went to England to avoid what he predicted would be controversy over the publication of this work. In London he cashed a cheque from his uncle for £200 (equal to £ today), much to Salomon&#x27;s chagrin. Heine was unimpressed by the English: he found them commercial and prosaic, and still blamed them for the defeat of Napoleon.

On his return to Germany, Cotta, the liberal publisher of Goethe and Schiller, offered Heine a job co-editing a magazine, &quot;Politische Annalen&quot;, in Munich. Heine did not find work on the newspaper congenial, and instead tried to obtain a professorship at Munich University, with no success. After a few months he took a trip to northern Italy, visiting Lucca, Florence and Venice, but was forced to return when he received news that his father had died. This Italian journey resulted in a series of new works: &quot;Die Reise von München nach Genua&quot; (&quot;Journey from Munich to Genoa&quot;), &quot;Die Bäder von Lucca&quot; (&quot;The Baths of Lucca&quot;) and &quot;Die Stadt Lucca&quot; (&quot;The Town of Lucca&quot;). 

&quot;Die Bäder von Lucca&quot; embroiled Heine in controversy. The aristocratic poet August von Platen had been annoyed by some epigrams by Immermann which Heine had included in the second volume of &quot;Reisebilder&quot;. He counter-attacked by writing a play, &quot;Der romantische Ödipus&quot;, which included anti-Semitic jibes about Heine. Heine was stung and responded by mocking Platen&#x27;s homosexuality in &quot;Die Bäder von Lucca&quot;. This back-and-forth ad hominem literary polemic has become known as the .

==Paris years==
===Foreign correspondent===

Heine left Germany for France in 1831, settling in Paris for the remainder of his life. His move was prompted by the July Revolution of 1830 that had made Louis-Philippe the &quot;Citizen King&quot; of the French. Heine shared liberal enthusiasm for the revolution, which he felt had the potential to overturn the conservative political order in Europe. Heine was also attracted by the prospect of freedom from German censorship and was interested in the new French utopian political doctrine of Saint-Simonianism. Saint-Simonianism preached a new social order in which meritocracy would replace hereditary distinctions in rank and wealth. There would also be female emancipation and an important role for artists and scientists. Heine frequented some Saint-Simonian meetings after his arrival in Paris but within a few years his enthusiasm for the ideology – and other forms of utopianism – had waned.

Heine soon became a celebrity in France. Paris offered him a cultural richness unavailable in the smaller cities of Germany. He made many famous acquaintances (the closest were Gérard de Nerval and Hector Berlioz) but he always remained something of an outsider. He had little interest in French literature and wrote everything in German, subsequently translating it into French with the help of a collaborator.

In Paris, Heine earned money working as the French correspondent for one of Cotta&#x27;s newspapers, the &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. The first event he covered was the Salon of 1831. His articles were eventually collected in a volume entitled &quot;Französische Zustände&quot; (&quot;Conditions in France&quot;). Heine saw himself as a mediator between Germany and France. If the two countries understood one another there would be progress. To further this aim he published &quot;De l&#x27;Allemagne&quot; (&quot;On Germany&quot;) in French (begun 1833). In its later German version, the book is divided into two: &quot;Zur Geschichte der Religion und Philosophie in Deutschland&quot; (&quot;On the History of Religion and Philosophy in Germany&quot;) and &quot;Die romantische Schule&quot; (&quot;The Romantic School&quot;).

Heine was deliberately attacking Madame de Staël&#x27;s book &quot;De l&#x27;Allemagne&quot; (1813) which he viewed as reactionary, Romantic and obscurantist. He felt de Staël had portrayed a Germany of &quot;poets and thinkers&quot;, dreamy, religious, introverted and cut off from the revolutionary currents of the modern world. Heine thought that such an image suited the oppressive German authorities. He also had an Enlightenment view of the past, seeing it as mired in superstition and atrocities. &quot;Religion and Philosophy in Germany&quot; describes the replacement of traditional &quot;spiritualist&quot; religion by a pantheism that pays attention to human material needs. According to Heine, pantheism had been repressed by Christianity and had survived in German folklore. He predicted that German thought would prove a more explosive force than the French Revolution.
Heine had had few serious love affairs, but in late 1834 he made the acquaintance of a 19-year-old Paris shopgirl, Crescence Eugénie Mirat, whom he nicknamed &quot;Mathilde&quot;. Heine began a relationship with her. She was illiterate, knew no German, and had no interest in cultural or intellectual matters. Nevertheless, she moved in with Heine in 1836 and lived with him for the rest of his life. They were married in 1841. Condescension typifies the ways in which &#x27;Mathilde&#x27; has been presented. For example, Heine&#x27;s niece, Maria Embden-Heine Rocca, accused her of often disturbing the poet&#x27;s work in the heat of creativity. However, Käthe Freiligrath-Kroecker&#x27;s memoir of Heine includes the observation that the poet was &quot;positively proud of the fact that his wife was unable to understand what he was to the world.&quot; As Keston Sutherland has remarked, &quot;What if she could never understand? What loss was that, to her, or him, or anyone else? Is their love not manifest in the many passages of his poetry that she would never read that luxuriate in the emptiness of understanding...?&quot;

===Young Germany and Ludwig Börne===

Heine and his fellow radical exile in Paris, Ludwig Börne, had become the role models for a younger generation of writers who were given the name &quot;Young Germany&quot;. They included Karl Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube, Theodor Mundt and Ludolf Wienbarg. They were liberal, but not actively political. Nevertheless, they still fell foul of the authorities. 

In 1835, Gutzkow published a novel, &quot;Wally die Zweiflerin&quot; (&quot;Wally the Sceptic&quot;), which contained criticism of the institution of marriage and some mildly erotic passages. In November of that year, the German Diet consequently banned publication of works by the Young Germans in Germany and – on Metternich&#x27;s insistence – Heine&#x27;s name was added to their number. Heine, however, continued to comment on German politics and society from a distance. His publisher was able to find some ways of getting around the censors and he was still free to publish in France.

Heine&#x27;s relationship with his fellow dissident Ludwig Börne was troubled. Since Börne did not attack religion or traditional morality like Heine, the German authorities hounded him less, although they still banned his books as soon as they appeared. 

Börne was the idol of German immigrant workers in Paris. He was a republican, while Heine was not. Heine regarded Börne, with his admiration for Robespierre, as a puritanical neo-Jacobin and remained aloof from him in Paris, which upset Börne, who began to criticise him, mostly semi-privately. In February 1837, Börne died. When Heine heard that Gutzkow was writing a biography of Börne, he began work on his own, severely critical &quot;memorial&quot; of the man.

When the book was published in 1840 it was universally disliked by the radicals and served to alienate Heine from his public. Even his enemies admitted that Börne was a man of integrity, so Heine&#x27;s &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks on him were viewed as being in poor taste. Heine had made personal attacks on Börne&#x27;s closest friend Jeanette Wohl, so Jeannette&#x27;s husband challenged Heine to a duel. It was the last Heine ever fought – he received a flesh wound in the hip. Before fighting, he decided to safeguard Mathilde&#x27;s future in the event of his death by marrying her.
Heine continued to write reports for Cotta&#x27;s &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, and, when Cotta died, for his son and successor. One event which really galvanised him was the 1840 Damascus Affair in which Jews in Damascus had been subject to blood libel and accused of murdering an old Catholic monk. This led to a wave of anti-Semitic persecution. 

The French government, aiming at imperialism in the Middle East and not wanting to offend the Catholic party, had failed to condemn the outrage. In contrast, the Austrian consul in Damascus had assiduously exposed the blood libel as a fraud. For Heine, this was a reversal of values: reactionary Austria standing up for the Jews while France temporised. Heine responded by dusting off and publishing his unfinished novel about the persecution of Jews in the Middle Ages, &quot;Der Rabbi von Bacherach&quot;.

===Political poetry and Karl Marx===
German poetry took a more directly political turn when the new Frederick William IV ascended the Prussian throne in 1840. Initially it was thought he might be a &quot;popular monarch&quot; and during this honeymoon period of his early reign (1840–42) censorship was relaxed. This led to the emergence of popular political poets (so-called &quot;Tendenzdichter&quot;), including Hoffmann von Fallersleben (author of &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot;, the German anthem), Ferdinand Freiligrath and Georg Herwegh. Heine looked down on these writers on aesthetic grounds – they were bad poets in his opinion – but his verse of the 1840s became more political too.

Heine&#x27;s mode was satirical attack: against the Kings of Bavaria and Prussia (he never for one moment shared the belief that Frederick William IV might be more liberal); against the political torpor of the German people; and against the greed and cruelty of the ruling class. The most popular of Heine&#x27;s political poems was his least typical, &quot;Die schlesischen Weber&quot; (&quot;The Silesian Weavers&quot;), based on the uprising of weavers in Peterswaldau in 1844.
In October 1843, Heine&#x27;s distant relative and German revolutionary, Karl Marx, and his wife Jenny von Westphalen arrived in Paris after the Prussian government had suppressed Marx&#x27;s radical newspaper. The Marx family settled in Rue Vaneau. Marx was an admirer of Heine and his early writings show Heine&#x27;s influence. In December Heine met the Marxes and got on well with them. He published several poems, including &quot;Die schlesischen Weber&quot;, in Marx&#x27;s new journal &quot;Vorwärts&quot; (&quot;Forwards&quot;). Ultimately Heine&#x27;s ideas of revolution through sensual emancipation and Marx&#x27;s scientific socialism were incompatible, but both writers shared the same negativity and lack of faith in the bourgeoisie.

In the isolation he felt after the Börne debacle, Marx&#x27;s friendship came as a relief to Heine, since he did not really like the other radicals. On the other hand, he did not share Marx&#x27;s faith in the industrial proletariat and remained on the fringes of socialist circles. The Prussian government, angry at the publication of &quot;Vorwärts&quot;, put pressure on France to deal with its authors, and Marx was deported to Belgium in January 1845. Heine could not be expelled from the country because he had the right of residence in France, having been born under French occupation. 

Thereafter Heine and Marx maintained a sporadic correspondence, but in time their admiration for each other faded. Heine always had mixed feelings about communism. He believed its radicalism and materialism would destroy much of the European culture that he loved and admired.

In the French edition of &quot;Lutetia&quot; Heine wrote, one year before he died: &quot;This confession, that the future belongs to the Communists, I made with an undertone of the greatest fear and sorrow and, oh!, this undertone by no means is a mask! Indeed, with fear and terror I imagine the time, when those dark iconoclasts come to power: with their raw fists they will batter all marble images of my beloved world of art, they will ruin all those fantastic anecdotes that the poets loved so much, they will chop down my Laurel forests and plant potatoes and, oh!, the herbs chandler will use my Book of Songs to make bags for coffee and snuff for the old women of the future – oh!, I can foresee all this and I feel deeply sorry thinking of this decline threatening my poetry and the old world order – And yet, I freely confess, the same thoughts have a magical appeal upon my soul which I cannot resist ... In my chest there are two voices in their favour which cannot be silenced ... because the first one is that of logic ... and as I cannot object to the premise &quot;that all people have the right to eat&quot;, I must defer to all the conclusions...The second of the two compelling voices, of which I am talking, is even more powerful than the first, because it is the voice of hatred, the hatred I dedicate to this common enemy that constitutes the most distinctive contrast to communism and that will oppose the angry giant already at the first instance – I am talking about the party of the so-called advocates of nationality in Germany, about those false patriots whose love for the fatherland only exists in the shape of imbecile distaste of foreign countries and neighbouring peoples and who daily pour their bile especially on France&quot;.

In October–December 1843, Heine made a journey to Hamburg to see his aged mother, and to patch things up with Campe with whom he had had a quarrel. He was reconciled with the publisher who agreed to provide Mathilde with an annuity for the rest of her life after Heine&#x27;s death. Heine repeated the trip with his wife in July–October 1844 to see Uncle Salomon, but this time things did not go so well. It was the last time Heine left France. At the time, Heine was working on two linked but antithetical poems with Shakespearean titles: &quot;Deutschland: Ein Wintermärchen&quot; (&quot;Germany. A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;) and &quot;Atta Troll: Ein Sommernachtstraum&quot; (&quot;Atta Troll: A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;). The former is based on his journey to Germany in late 1843 and outdoes the radical poets in its satirical attacks on the political situation in the country. 

&quot;Atta Troll&quot;, begun in 1841 after a trip to the Pyrenees, mocks the literary failings Heine saw in the radical poets, particularly Freiligrath. It tells the story of the hunt for a runaway bear, Atta Troll, who symbolises many of the attitudes Heine despised, including a simple-minded egalitarianism and a religious view which makes God in the believer&#x27;s image. Atta Troll conceives God as an enormous, heavenly polar bear. Atta Troll&#x27;s cubs embody the nationalistic views Heine loathed.

&quot;Atta Troll&quot; was published in 1847. &quot;Deutschland&quot; appeared in 1844 as part of a collection &quot;Neue Gedichte&quot; (&quot;New Poems&quot;), which gathered all the verse Heine had written since 1831. In the same year Uncle Salomon died. This put a stop to Heine&#x27;s annual subsidy of 4,800 francs. Salomon left Heine and his brothers 8,000 francs each in his will. Heine&#x27;s cousin Carl, the inheritor of Salomon&#x27;s business, offered to pay him 2,000 francs a year at his discretion. Heine was furious; he had expected much more from the will and his campaign to make Carl revise its terms occupied him for the next two years.

In 1844, Heine wrote series of musical feuilletons over several different music seasons discussing the music of the day. His review of the musical season of 1844, written in Paris on 25 April 1844, is his first reference to Lisztomania, the intense fan frenzy directed toward Franz Liszt during his performances. Heine was not always honorable in his musical criticism. That same month, he wrote to Liszt suggesting that he might like to look at a newspaper review he had written of Liszt&#x27;s performance &quot;before&quot; his concert; he indicated that it contained comments Liszt would not like. 

Liszt took this as an attempt to extort money for a positive review and did not meet Heine. Heine&#x27;s review subsequently appeared on 25 April in &quot;Musikalische Berichte aus Paris&quot; and attributed Liszt&#x27;s success to lavish expenditures on bouquets and to the wild behaviour of his hysterical female &quot;fans&quot;. Liszt then broke relations with Heine. Liszt was not the only musician to be blackmailed by Heine for the nonpayment of &quot;appreciation money&quot;. Meyerbeer had both lent and given money to Heine, but after refusing to hand over a further 500 francs was repaid by being dubbed &quot;a music corrupter&quot; in Heine&#x27;s poem &quot;Die Menge tut es&quot;.

===Last years: the &quot;mattress-grave&quot;===
In May 1848, Heine, who had not been well, suddenly fell paralyzed and had to be confined to bed. He would not leave what he called his &quot;mattress-grave&quot; (&quot;Matratzengruft&quot;) until his death eight years later. He also experienced difficulties with his eyes. It had been suggested that he suffered from multiple sclerosis or syphilis, although in 1997 it was confirmed through an analysis of the poet&#x27;s hair that he had suffered from chronic lead poisoning. 

He bore his sufferings stoically and he won much public sympathy for his plight. His illness meant he paid less attention than he might otherwise have done to the revolutions which broke out in France and Germany in 1848. He was sceptical about the Frankfurt Assembly and continued to attack the King of Prussia.

When the revolution collapsed, Heine resumed his oppositional stance. At first he had some hope Louis Napoleon might be a good leader in France, but he soon began to share the opinion of Marx towards him as the new emperor began to crack down on liberalism and socialism. In 1848 Heine also returned to religious faith. In fact, he had never claimed to be an atheist. Nevertheless, Heine remained skeptical of organised religion.

He continued to work from his sickbed: on the collections of poems &quot;Romanzero&quot; and &quot;Gedichte (1853 und 1854)&quot;, on the journalism collected in &quot;Lutezia&quot;, and on his unfinished memoirs. During these final years Heine had a love affair with the young Camille Selden, who visited him regularly. He died on 17 February 1856 and was interred in the Paris Cimetière de Montmartre.

His tomb was designed by Danish sculptor Louis Hasselriis. It includes Heine&#x27;s poem &quot;Where?&quot; () engraved on three sides of the tombstone.
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;
Wo wird einst des Wandermüden
Letzte Ruhestätte sein?
Unter Palmen in dem Süden?
Unter Linden an dem Rhein?

Werd&#x27; ich wo in einer Wüste
Eingescharrt von fremder Hand?
Oder ruh&#x27; ich an der Küste
Eines Meeres in dem Sand?

Immerhin! Mich wird umgeben
Gottes Himmel, dort wie hier,
Und als Totenlampen schweben
Nachts die Sterne über mir.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;
Where shall I, the wander-wearied,
Find my haven and my shrine? 
Under palms will I be buried?
Under lindens on the Rhine?

Shall I lie in desert reaches,
Buried by a stranger&#x27;s hand? 
Or upon the well-loved beaches,
Covered by the friendly sand?

Well, what matter! God has given
Wider spaces there than here.
And the stars that swing in heaven
Shall be lamps above my bier.
(translation in verse by L.U.)&lt;/poem&gt;
His wife Mathilde died in 1883. The couple had no children.

==Legacy==
Among the thousands of books burned on Berlin&#x27;s Opernplatz in 1933, following the Nazi raid on the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft, were works by Heinrich Heine. To memorialize the event, one of the most famous lines of Heine&#x27;s 1821 play &quot;Almansor&quot;, spoken by the Muslim Hassan upon hearing that Christian conquerors burned the Quran at the marketplace of Granada, was engraved in the ground at the site: (&quot;That was but a prelude; where they burn books, they will ultimately burn people as well.&quot;)

In 1835, 98 years before Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party seized power in Germany, Heine wrote in his essay &quot;The History of Religion and Philosophy in Germany&quot;:
Christianity – and that is its greatest merit – has somewhat mitigated that brutal Germanic love of war, but it could not destroy it. Should that subduing talisman, the cross, be shattered, the frenzied madness of the ancient warriors, that insane Berserk rage of which Nordic bards have spoken and sung so often, will once more burst into flame. This talisman is fragile, and the day will come when it will collapse miserably. Then the ancient stony gods will rise from the forgotten debris and rub the dust of a thousand years from their eyes, and finally Thor with his giant hammer will jump up and smash the Gothic cathedrals. ...

Do not smile at my advice – the advice of a dreamer who warns you against Kantians, Fichteans, and philosophers of nature. Do not smile at the visionary who anticipates the same revolution in the realm of the visible as has taken place in the spiritual. Thought precedes action as lightning precedes thunder. German thunder is of true Germanic character; it is not very nimble, but rumbles along ponderously. Yet, it will come and when you hear a crashing such as never before has been heard in the world&#x27;s history, then you know that the German thunderbolt has fallen at last. At that uproar the eagles of the air will drop dead, and lions in the remotest deserts of Africa will hide in their royal dens. A play will be performed in Germany which will make the French Revolution look like an innocent idyll.

The North American Heine Society was formed in 1982.

=== Heine in Nazi Germany ===
Heine&#x27;s writings were abhorred by the Nazis and one of their political mouthpieces, the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, made noteworthy efforts to attack him. Within the pantheon of the &quot;Jewish cultural intelligentsia&quot; chosen for anti-Semitic demonization, perhaps nobody was the recipient of more National Socialist vitriol than Heinrich Heine. When a memorial to Heine was completed in 1926, the paper lamented that Hamburg had erected a &quot;Jewish Monument to Heine and Damascus...one in which &quot;Alljuda&quot; ruled!&quot;. 

Editors for the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; referred to Heine&#x27;s writing as degenerate on multiple occasions, as did Alfred Rosenberg. Correspondingly, as part of the effort to dismiss and hide Jewish contribution to German art and culture, all Heine monuments were removed or destroyed during Nazi Germany and Heine&#x27;s books were suppressed and, from 1940 on, banned.

The popularity of many songs to Heine&#x27;s lyrics represented a problem for the policy of silencing and proposals such as bans or rewriting the lyrics were discussed. However, in contrast to an often-made claim, there is no evidence that poems such as &quot;&quot; were included in anthologies as written by an &quot;unknown author&quot;.

===Music===
Many composers have set Heine&#x27;s works to music. They include Robert Schumann (especially his Lieder cycle &quot;Dichterliebe&quot;), Friedrich Silcher (who wrote a popular setting of &quot;Die Lorelei&quot;, one of Heine&#x27;s best known poems), Franz Schubert, Franz Liszt, Felix Mendelssohn, Fanny Mendelssohn, Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, Richard Strauss, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Edward MacDowell, Clara Ross, Elise Schlick, Elise Schmezer, Sophie Seipt, Charlotte Sporleder, Maria Anna Stubenberg, Pauline Volkstein, Clara Schumann and Richard Wagner; and in the 20th century Lord Berners, Yehezkel Braun, Hans Werner Henze, Paul Lincke, Nikolai Medtner, Carl Orff, Harriet P. Sawyer, Marcel Tyberg and Lola Carrier Worrell.

Heine&#x27;s play &quot;William Ratcliff&quot; was used for the libretti of operas by César Cui (&quot;William Ratcliff&quot;) and Pietro Mascagni (&quot;Guglielmo Ratcliff&quot;). Frank Van der Stucken composed a &quot;symphonic prologue&quot; to the same play.

In 1964, Gert Westphal and the Attila-Zoller Quartet released the vinyl &quot;Heinrich Heine Lyrik und Jazz&quot;. In 2006 Philips/Universal launched a republication on CD.

Wilhelm Killmayer set 37 of his poems in his song book &quot;&quot;, subtitled &quot;Ein Liederbuch nach Gedichten von Heinrich Heine&quot;, in 1994.

Morton Feldman&#x27;s &quot;I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg&quot; was inspired by a vision he had of the dead Heine as he walked through Heine&#x27;s old neighborhood in Paris: &quot;One early morning in Paris I was walking along the small street on the Left Bank where Delacroix&#x27;s studio is, just as it was more than a century ago. I&#x27;d read his journals, where he tells of Chopin, going for a drive, the poet Heine dropping in, a refugee from Germany. Nothing had changed in the street. And I saw Heine up at the corner, walking toward me. He almost reached me. I had this intense feeling for him, you know, the Jewish exile. I saw him. Then I went back to my place and wrote my work, &quot;I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg&quot;.&quot;

===Controversy===

In the 1890s, amidst a flowering of affection for Heine leading up to the centennial of his birth, plans were made to honor Heine with a memorial. These were strongly supported by one of Heine&#x27;s greatest admirers, Elisabeth of Bavaria, Empress of Austria. The empress commissioned a statue from the sculptor Louis Hasselriis. This statue, originally located at Achilleion, Empress Elisabeth&#x27;s palace in Corfu, was later removed by Kaiser Wilhelm II after he acquired Achilleion in 1907, but it eventually found a home in Toulon. This became the inspiration for Tony Harrison&#x27;s 1992 film-poem, &quot;The Gaze of the Gorgon&quot;.

Another memorial, a sculpted fountain, was commissioned for Düsseldorf. While at first the plan met with enthusiasm, the concept was gradually bogged down in anti-Semitic, nationalist, and religious criticism; by the time the fountain was finished, there was no place to put it. Through the intervention of German American activists, the memorial was ultimately transplanted into the Bronx, New York City (in Philadelphia already in 1855 was printed the complete edition of Heine&#x27;s works in German language). While the memorial is known in English as the Lorelei Fountain, Germans refer to it as the Heinrich Heine Memorial. Also, after years of controversy, the University of Düsseldorf was named Heinrich Heine University. Today the city honours its poet with a boulevard (Heinrich-Heine-Allee) and a modern monument.

In Israel, the attitude to Heine has long been the subject of debate between secularists, who number him among the most prominent figures of Jewish history, and the religious who consider his conversion to Christianity to be an unforgivable act of betrayal. Due to such debates, the city of Tel Aviv delayed naming a street for Heine, and the street finally chosen to bear his name is located in a rather desolate industrial zone rather than in the vicinity of Tel Aviv University, suggested by some public figures as the appropriate location.

&quot;Ha-‘Ir&quot; (&quot;העיר&quot; – &quot;The City&quot;, a left-leaning Tel Aviv magazine) sarcastically suggested that &quot;The Exiling of Heine Street&quot; symbolically re-enacted the course of Heine&#x27;s own life. Since then, a street in the Yemin Moshe neighborhood of Jerusalem and, in Haifa, a street with a beautiful square and a community center have been named after Heine. A Heine Appreciation Society is active in Israel, led by prominent political figures from both the left and right camps. His quote about burning books is prominently displayed in the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem. It is also displayed in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and in the pavement in Frankfurt am Main.

<text>Things to Come (also known as Shape of Things to Come and in promotional material as H. G. Wells&#x27; Things to Come) is a 1936 British science fiction film produced by Alexander Korda, directed by William Cameron Menzies, and written by H. G. Wells. The film stars Raymond Massey, Edward Chapman, Ralph Richardson, Margaretta Scott, Cedric Hardwicke, Maurice Braddell, Sophie Stewart, Derrick De Marney, and Ann Todd.

H. G. Wells conceived his treatment as &quot;a new story&quot; meant to display the &quot;social and political forces and possibilities&quot; that he had outlined in his 1933 book &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot;, a work he considered less a novel than a &quot;discussion&quot; in fictional form that presented itself as the notes of a 22nd-century diplomat. The film was also influenced by previous works, including his 1897 story &quot;A Story of the Days to Come&quot; and his 1931 work on society and economics, &quot;The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind&quot;. The cultural historian Christopher Frayling called &quot;Things to Come&quot; &quot;a landmark in cinematic design&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1940, businessman John Cabal, living in the city of Everytown in southern England, cannot enjoy Christmas Day as the news speaks of possible war. His guest, Harding, shares his worries, while another friend, the over-optimistic Pippa Passworthy, believes that it will not come to pass, and if it does, it will accelerate technological progress. An aerial bombing raid on the city that night results in general mobilisation and then global war with the unnamed enemy. Cabal becomes a Royal Air Force pilot and serves bravely, even attempting to rescue an enemy pilot he has shot down.

The war continues into the 1960s, long enough for the people of the world to have forgotten why they are fighting. Humanity enters a new dark age. Every city in the world is in ruins, the economy has been devastated by hyperinflation, and there is little technology left other than greatly depleted air forces. A pestilence known as &quot;wandering sickness&quot; is inflicted by aerial bombing and causes its victims to walk around aimlessly in a zombie-like state before dying. The plague kills half of humanity and extinguishes the last vestiges of government.

By 1970, the warlord Rudolf, known as the &quot;Boss&quot;, has become the chieftain of what is left of Everytown and eradicated the pestilence by shooting the infected. He has started yet another war, this time against the &quot;hill people&quot; of the Floss Valley to obtain coal and shale to render into oil for his ragtag collection of prewar biplanes.

On May Day that year, a sleek new monoplane lands in Everytown, startling the residents, who have not seen a new aircraft in many years. The pilot, a now elderly John Cabal, emerges and proclaims that the last surviving band of engineers and mechanics have formed an organisation called &quot;Wings Over the World&quot;. They are based in Basra, Iraq, and have outlawed war and are rebuilding civilisation throughout the Near East and the Mediterranean. Cabal offers the Boss the opportunity to join Wings, but he immediately rejects the offer and takes Cabal prisoner, forcing him to repair the obsolete biplanes.

With the assistance of Cabal, the Boss&#x27;s disillusioned mechanic Gordon contacts Wings Over the World. Gigantic flying wing aircraft arrive over Everytown and saturate its population with a &quot;Gas of Peace&quot; that temporarily renders them unconscious. The people awaken to find themselves under the control of Wings Over the World and the Boss dead from a fatal allergic reaction to the gas. Cabal promises them that Wings Over the World will usher in a new age of progress and peace.

Under Cabal&#x27;s guidance, Wings Over the World quickly rebuilds civilisation to even greater heights. By 2036, a stable mankind is now living in modern underground cities, including the new Everytown, and civilisation is at last devoted to peace and scientific progress. All is not well, however. The sculptor Theotocopulos incites the populace to demand a &quot;rest&quot; from all the rush of progress, symbolised by the coming first crewed flight around the Moon. When the mob threatens to destroy the space gun that will launch the ship to the Moon, Oswald Cabal, the grandson of John Cabal and current head of government, is forced to move the launch ahead of schedule.

Oswald Cabal&#x27;s daughter Catherine and fellow scientist Maurice Passworthy are the passengers. After the projectile is launched and just a tiny light in the night sky, Cabal debates the desirability of human progress with Passworthy&#x27;s anxious father. To Passworthy&#x27;s concern that humanity shall never be able to rest, Cabal retorts that humans have no choice but to conquer the universe and its mysteries: &quot;All the universe or nothingness? Which shall it be, Passworthy? Which shall it be?&quot;

Cast notes
* Theotocopulos&#x27;s scenes were originally shot with Ernest Thesiger. Wells found his performance to be unsatisfactory, so he was replaced with Cedric Hardwicke and the footage reshot.
* Terry-Thomas, who would become known for his comic acting, has an uncredited appearance as an extra in the film, playing a &quot;man of the future.&quot; It was his seventh film appearance.
* In some prints of the film Margaretta Scott is still credited with the dual role of Roxana Black and Rowena Cabal, but the latter character does not appear in the extant footage.

==Production==
&quot;Things to Come&quot; sets out a future history from 1940 to 2036. In the screenplay, or &quot;treatment&quot; that Wells published in 1935, before the film was released, the story ends in &quot;A.D. 2054&quot;.

Wells is sometimes incorrectly assumed to have had a degree of control over the project that was unprecedented for a screenwriter. Posters and the main title bill the film as &quot;H. G. Wells&#x27; Things to Come&quot;, with &quot;an Alexander Korda production&quot; appearing in smaller type. In fact, Wells ultimately had no control over the finished product, with the result that many scenes, although shot, were either truncated or not included in the finished film. The rough-cut reputedly ran to 130 minutes; the version submitted to the British Board of Film Censors was 117m 13s; it was released as 108m 40s (later cut to 98m 06s) in the UK, and 96m 24s in the United States (see below for later versions). Wells&#x27;s script (or &quot;film treatment&quot;) and selected production notes were published in book form in 1935 and reprinted in 1940 and 1975. An academic edition annotated by Leon Stover was published in 2007. The script contains many scenes that were either never filmed or no longer exist, although the extant footage also includes scenes not in the published script (e.g. the Boss&#x27;s victory banquet after the capture of the colliery).

Wells originally wanted the music to be recorded in advance, and have the film constructed around the music, but this would have impeded editing, and so the score, by Arthur Bliss, was fitted to the film afterwards in a more conventional way. A concert suite drawn from the film has remained popular; as of 2015, numerous recordings of it were still in print.

The film was made at Denham Film Studios, while the site was still under construction.

After filming had already begun, the Hungarian abstract artist and experimental filmmaker László Moholy-Nagy was commissioned to produce some of the effects sequences for the re-building of Everytown. Moholy-Nagy&#x27;s approach was partly to treat it as an abstract light show, but only some 90 seconds of material was used, e.g. a protective-suited figure behind corrugated glass (which could be Terry-Thomas, as the figure has a moustache and he was billed as &#x27;A Man of the Future). In the autumn of 1975 a researcher found a further four sequences which had been discarded.

The art design in the film is by Vincent Korda, brother of the producer. The futuristic city of Everytown in the film is based on London: a facsimile of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral can be seen in the background.

==Reception==
&quot;Things to Come&quot; was voted the ninth best British film of 1936 by &quot;Film Weekly&quot;″s readers. It was the 16th most popular film at the British box office in 1935–36. In 2005, it was nominated for the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores, a list of the top 25 film scores unveiled by the American Film Institute.

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 93%, based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 7.46/10. The site&#x27;s consensus read: &quot;Eerily prescient in its presentation of a dystopian future, &quot;Things to Come&quot;&#x27;s special effects may be somewhat dated, but its potent ideas haven&#x27;t aged at all.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a mixed review. Although he made it clear that &quot;a third of the film is magnificent&quot;, he felt that the second third (as the world of tomorrow reverts to barbarism and anarchy) seemed implausible, and began to lose interest with the introduction of the &quot;Great Conspiracy&quot; (an international force of airmen bent on restoring Earth&#x27;s former glory) in the last third of the film. The optimism and idealism comes off as naive for him.

Science fiction historian Gary Westfahl has stated, &quot;&quot;Things to Come&quot; qualifies as the first true masterpiece of science fiction cinema, and those who complain about its awkward pace and uninvolving characters are not understanding Wells&#x27;s message, which is that the lives and actions of individuals are unimportant when compared to the progress and destiny of the entire human race&quot;. He also considered that &quot;the film&#x27;s episodic structure and grand ambitions make it the greatest ancestor of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;&quot;.

Indeed, during early development of what would become &quot;2001&quot;, co-writer Arthur C. Clarke had Kubrick watch &quot;Things to Come&quot; as an example of a grounded science fiction film; Kubrick, however, disliked it. After seeing &quot;2001&quot;, Frederik Pohl complained in a 1968 &quot;Galaxy&quot; editorial: 

==Duration, releases, and surviving versions==
The rough cut of the film was 130 minutes in length, while the version submitted for classification by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) was 117m 13s. By the time of the 21 February 1936 UK premiere and initial release, this had been reduced to 108m 41s, while the American print premiered on 18 April 1936 was further cut to 96m 31s. By late 1936, a 98m 07s print was in circulation in the UK, and a 76m 07s print was resubmitted for classification by the BBFC and was passed – after further cuts – at 72m 13s for a reissue in 1943 by Exclusive Films, a film distribution company co-founded by William Hinds.

The 96m 31s American print was cut down to 93m 19s by the removal of three sections of footage for a reissue by British Lion Films in 1948, and subsequently to 92m 44s by the removal of one more segment. A continuity script exists for a version of approximately 106m 04s, which contains all the material in the 96m 31s and 92m 44s versions, plus a number of other sequences. It is not known if a version of this duration was actually in circulation at any time, or if it was simply an intermediate stage between the premiere and release versions.

For many years, the principal surviving version of the film was the 92m 44s print (in countries using PAL or SECAM video systems, it runs to 89m exactly). From at least the late-1970s until 2007, this was the only version &quot;officially&quot; available from the rights holders in the UK. In the United States, although the 92m 44s version was most prevalent, a version was also in circulation that included the four pieces of footage that were in the 96m 31s print, but not the 92m 44s version, although due to other cuts, actually ran shorter than the latter.

==Home media==
A cut version of the 92m 44s print was digitally restored and colourised by Legend Films, under the supervision of Ray Harryhausen (who had no connection with the making of the film) and released on DVD in the United States in early 2007.

In May 2007, Network DVD in the UK released a digitally restored copy of the 96m 31s version, the longest version remaining of the film. The two-disc set also contains a &quot;Virtual Extended Version&quot; with most of the missing and unfilmed parts represented by production photographs and script extracts. In 2011 Network released an updated and expanded version of this edition on Blu-ray in HD.

The Criterion Collection released the 96m 31s print on DVD and Blu-ray in North America on 18 June 2013. This includes the unused Moholy-Nagy footage as an extra.

==Copyright status==
Although the film lapsed into the public domain in the US in 1964 due to non-renewal, copyright remained in force in the UK, the European Union, and elsewhere. In the UK, copyright for films as &quot;dramatic works&quot; subsists for seventy years after the end of the year of release, or the death of either the director, the writer (or author of original story), or the composer of original music, whichever is the latest. As the composer, Arthur Bliss, did not die until 1975, copyright will not expire until after 31 December 2045. The current copyright holder is ITV Global Entertainment Ltd., while the longest surviving original nitrate print is held by the BFI National Archive, a copy of the 96m 31s print donated by London Films to the newly formed National Film Library in March 1936.

The film came back into copyright in the US in 1996 under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), which, among other measures, amended US copyright law to reinstate copyright on films of non-US origin if they were still in copyright in their country of origin. The URAA was subsequently challenged in &quot;Golan v. Gonzales&quot;, initially unsuccessfully, later with partial success, but the challenge was ultimately defeated in &quot;Golan v. Holder&quot; and a new principle established that international agreements could indeed restore copyright to works which had previously come into the public domain.

<doc id="104645" wikidata="Q1410913" url="?curid=104645" title="Netscape Communicator">
<text>Netscape Communicator (or &quot;Netscape 4&quot;) is a discontinued Internet suite produced by Netscape Communications Corporation, and was the fourth major release in the Netscape line of browsers. It was first in beta in 1996 and was released in June 1997. Netscape Communicator addressed the problem of Netscape Navigator 3.x being used as both the name of the suite and the browser contained within it by renaming the suite to Netscape &quot;Communicator&quot;. It included more groupware features intended to appeal to enterprises.

In February 1998, Netscape announced that Mozilla.org would co-ordinate the development of Netscape Communicator 5 as &quot;a dedicated team within Netscape with an associated Web site that will promote, foster and guide open dialog and development of Netscape&#x27;s client source code.&quot; However, the aging Communicator code proved to be difficult to work with, so it was abandoned. The whole source code of Communicator was re-written by Mozilla, who were then testing it as Mozilla Application Suite. Netscape, now owned by AOL, finally released Communicator&#x27;s successor Netscape 6 in November 2000, based on Mozilla Application Suite with changes and additions. Minor updates to Communicator continued to be issued, culminating in the release of Netscape Communicator 4.8 in August 2002.

== Editions ==
Netscape Communicator was available in various editions, such as &quot;Professional&quot; and &quot;Complete&quot;. The following components were included in Netscape Communicator (different editions had different components and some components were dropped in later editions):

===Features===
*Netscape Navigator — Web browser
*Netscape Messenger — e-mail client and (in version 4.5 and above) news client
*Netscape Collabra — news client (merged into Messenger in version 4.5)
*Netscape Address Book — address book
*Netscape Composer — HTML editor
*Netscape Netcaster — push technology client (dropped in version 4.5)
*Netscape Conference — multi-user communication client (dropped in version 4.5)
*Netscape Calendar — enterprise calendar client (dropped in version 4.72 because Netscape&#x27;s license to use the underlying technology expired)

===Updates===
In October 1998, a major update to the program was released as Netscape 4.5. This included many improvements, mostly to the Messenger e-mail client, which now also took on the features of Collabra. However, some of the less popular components, such as Netcaster, were dropped. A feature called &quot;Roaming Profiles&quot; was added in version 4.5 that synchronized a user&#x27;s bookmarks, address book and preferences with a remote server, so that a user&#x27;s home and work browsers could have the same bookmarks. By the time version 4.5 was released, Netscape had started the Mozilla open source project and had ceased charging for Communicator.

The term &quot;Navigator&quot; referred to the browser component alone, while &quot;Communicator&quot; referred to the suite as a whole, as established in version 4.0. However, due to user confusion, the names were often used interchangeably. Also, because none of the applications besides Navigator were popular on their own, and because Netscape never produced any other desktop software that approached the popularity of Navigator, people would often refer to both the Communicator suite and the Navigator browser as simply &quot;Netscape&quot;.

The Mozilla Foundation continued to develop the Netscape code base, providing the Mozilla Application Suite as a continuation of Netscape Communicator. The Mozilla Foundation decided in 2006 to discontinue development of the Application Suite. A community-maintained version called SeaMonkey has come to replace the Application Suite - maintaining such things as browser, integrated POP/IMAP/SMTP style E-mail client, IRC, and other similar features.

<doc id="104646" wikidata="Q1547424" url="?curid=104646" title="Gravitational binding energy">
<text>The gravitational binding energy of a system is the minimum energy which must be added to it in order for the system to cease being in a gravitationally bound state. A gravitationally bound system has a lower (&quot;i.e.&quot;, more negative) gravitational potential energy than the sum of the energies of its parts when these are completely separated—this is what keeps the system in accordance with the minimum total potential energy principle. 

The gravitational binding energy can be conceptually different within the theories of Newtonian gravity and Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of gravity called General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the binding energy can be considered to be the linear sum of the interactions between all pairs of microscopic components of the system, while in General Relativity, this is only approximately true if the gravitational fields are all weak. When stronger fields are present within a system, the binding energy is a nonlinear property of the system, and it cannot be conceptually attributed among the elements of the system. In this case the binding energy can be considered to be the (negative) difference between the ADM mass of the system, as it is manifest in its gravitational interaction with other distant systems, and the sum of the energies of all the atoms and other elementary particles of the system if disassembled. 

For a spherical body of uniform density, the gravitational binding energy &quot;U&quot; is given in Newtonian gravity by the formula
formula_1
where &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant, &quot;M&quot; is the mass of the sphere, and &quot;R&quot; is its radius.

Assuming that the Earth is a sphere of uniform density (which it is not, but is close enough to get an order-of-magnitude estimate) with &quot;M&quot; = and &quot;r&quot; = , then &quot;U&quot; = . This is roughly equal to one week of the Sun&#x27;s total energy output. It is , 60% of the absolute value of the potential energy per kilogram at the surface.

The actual depth-dependence of density, inferred from seismic travel times (see Adams–Williamson equation), is given in the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM). Using this, the real gravitational binding energy of Earth can be calculated numerically as &quot;U&quot; = .

According to the virial theorem, the gravitational binding energy of a star is about two times its internal thermal energy in order for hydrostatic equilibrium to be maintained. As the gas in a star becomes more relativistic, the gravitational binding energy required for hydrostatic equilibrium approaches zero and the star becomes unstable (highly sensitive to perturbations), which may lead to a supernova in the case of a high-mass star due to strong radiation pressure or to a black hole in the case of a neutron star.

==Derivation within Newtonian gravity for a uniform sphere==
The gravitational binding energy of a sphere with radius formula_2 is found by imagining that it is pulled apart by successively moving spherical shells to infinity, the outermost first, and finding the total energy needed for that.

Assuming a constant density formula_3, the masses of a shell and the sphere inside it are:
formula_4
and
formula_5

The required energy for a shell is the negative of the gravitational potential energy:
formula_6

Integrating over all shells yields:
formula_7

Since formula_3 is simply equal to the mass of the whole divided by its volume for objects with uniform density, therefore

formula_9

And finally, plugging this into our result leads to
formula_10

==Negative mass component==
Two bodies, placed at the distance &quot;R&quot; from each other and reciprocally not moving, exert a gravitational force on a third body slightly smaller when &quot;R&quot; is small. This can be seen as a negative mass component of the system, equal, for uniformly spherical solutions, to:
formula_11

For example, the fact that Earth is a gravitationally-bound sphere of its current size &quot;costs&quot; of mass (roughly one fourth the mass of Phobos – see above for the same value in Joules), and if its atoms were sparse over an arbitrarily large volume the Earth would weigh its current mass plus kilograms (and its gravitational pull over a third body would be accordingly stronger).

It can be easily demonstrated that this negative component can never exceed the positive component of a system. A negative binding energy greater than the mass of the system itself would indeed require that the radius of the system be smaller than:
formula_12
which is smaller than formula_13 its Schwarzschild radius:
formula_14
and therefore never visible to an external observer. However this is only a Newtonian approximation and in relativistic conditions other factors must be taken into account as well.

==Non-uniform spheres==
Planets and stars have radial density gradients from their lower density surfaces to their much denser compressed cores. Degenerate matter objects (white dwarfs; neutron star pulsars) have radial density gradients plus relativistic corrections.

Neutron star relativistic equations of state include a graph of radius vs. mass for various models. The most likely radii for a given neutron star mass are bracketed by models AP4 (smallest radius) and MS2 (largest radius). BE is the ratio of gravitational binding energy mass equivalent to observed neutron star gravitational mass of &quot;M&quot; with radius &quot;R&quot;, 
formula_15
formula_16

Given current values
*formula_17
*formula_18
*formula_19
and the star mass &quot;M&quot; expressed relative to the solar mass,
formula_20

then the relativistic fractional binding energy of a neutron star is

formula_21

<text>Oscar II (Oscar Fredrik; 21 January 1829 – 8 December 1907) was King of Sweden from 1872 until his death in 1907 and King of Norway from 1872 to 1905.

Oscar was the son of King Oscar I and Queen Josephine. He inherited the Swedish and Norwegian thrones when his brother died in 1872. Oscar II ruled during a time when both countries were undergoing a period of industrialization and rapid technological progress. His reign also saw the gradual decline of the Union of Sweden and Norway, which culminated in its dissolution in 1905. In 1905, the throne of Norway was transferred to his grandnephew Prince Carl of Denmark under the regnal name Haakon VII. When Oscar died in 1907, he was succeeded in Sweden by his eldest son, Gustaf V.

==Early life==

Oscar Fredrik was born at the Royal Palace in Stockholm on 21 January 1829, the third of four sons of Crown Prince Oscar and Josephine of Leuchtenberg. Upon his birth, he was created Duke of Östergötland. At birth, he was fourth in the succession to the Swedish throne after his father and older brothers, but as a younger son had no immediate prospect of inheriting the throne. During his childhood, he was placed in the care of the royal governess, Countess Christina Ulrika Taube.

Prince Oscar entered the Royal Swedish Navy as a midshipman at the age of 11, and was appointed junior lieutenant in July 1845. Later, he studied at Uppsala University, where he distinguished himself in mathematics. On 13 December 1848, was made an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

On 6 June 1857, Prince Oscar married Princess Sophia of Nassau at the Biebrich Palace, the ducal residence of the Duchy of Nassau, with whom he had four sons. Princess Sophia was the youngest daughter of Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau and Princess Pauline Friederike Marie of Württemberg, and a half-sister of Adolphe, the then reigning Duke of Nassau and future Grand Duke of Luxembourg.
Upon the death of his father, King Oscar I, in 1859, Prince Oscar became heir presumptive to the thrones of Sweden and Norway, as his eldest brother King Charles XV of Sweden/Charles IV of Norway was without a legitimate heir, having lost his only son, Prince Carl Oscar, Duke of Södermanland, to pneumonia in 1854. His second elder brother, Prince Gustaf, Duke of Uppland, had died of typhoid fever already in 1852.

==King of Sweden and Norway==
===Accession===

Oscar II became King on 18 September 1872, upon the death of his brother, Charles XV who died without an heir. At his accession, he adopted as his motto &quot;Brödrafolkens väl&quot; / &quot;Broderfolkenes Vel&quot; (&quot;The Welfare of the Brother Peoples&quot;). His coronation as Swedish monarch was celebrated in Storkyrkan in Stockholm on 12 May 1873, and his coronation as Norwegian monarch two months later in the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on 18 July 1873. While the King, his family and the Royal Court resided mostly in Sweden, Oscar II made the effort of learning to be fluent in Norwegian and from the very beginning realized the essential difficulties in the maintenance of the union between the two countries.

===Foreign and domestic statecraft===

His acute intelligence and his aloofness from the dynastic considerations affecting most European sovereigns (both his paternal and maternal grandfathers were French military commanders who served under Napoleon I) gave the king considerable weight as an arbitrator in international questions. At the request of the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States in 1889, he appointed the Chief Justice of Samoa under the Treaty of Berlin, and he was again called on to arbitrate in Samoan affairs in 1899.
In 1897, he was empowered to appoint a fifth arbitrator if necessary in the Venezuelan dispute, and he was called on to act as umpire in the Anglo-American arbitration treaty that was quashed by the United States Senate. He won many friends in the United Kingdom by his outspoken and generous support of Britain at the time of the Second Boer War (1899–1902), expressed in a declaration printed in &quot;The Times&quot; of 2 May 1900, when continental opinion was almost universally hostile.

He remained a strong supporter of the Navy throughout his life, and frequently visited ships of the fleet. When the coastal defence ship was launched, he even signed his name on the vessel&#x27;s aft main gun tower.

The office of Prime Minister of Sweden was instituted in 1876. Louis De Geer became the first head of government in Sweden to use this title. The most known and powerful first minister of the Crown during the reign of Oscar was the conservative estate owner Erik Gustaf Boström. Boström served as Prime Minister in 1891–1900 and 1902–1905. He was trusted and respected by Oscar II, who had much difficulty approving someone else as prime minister. Over a period of time, the King gave Boström a free hand to select his own ministers without much royal involvement. It was an arrangement (unintentional by both the King and Boström) that furthered the road to parliamentarism.

===Science and the arts===

A distinguished writer and musical amateur himself, King Oscar did much to encourage the development of education throughout his dominions. In 1858, a collection of his lyrical and narrative poems, &quot;Memorials of the Swedish Fleet&quot;, published anonymously, obtained the second prize of the Swedish Academy. His &quot;Contributions to the Military History of Sweden in the Years 1711, 1712, 1713&quot;, originally appeared in the Annals of the academy, and were printed separately in 1865. His works, which included his speeches, translations of Herder&#x27;s &quot;Cid&quot; and Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Torquato Tasso&quot;, and a play, &quot;Castle Cronberg&quot;, were collected in two volumes in 1875–76, and a larger edition, in three volumes, appeared in 1885–88.

His Easter hymn and some other of his poems are familiar throughout the Scandinavian countries. His work on Charles XII of Sweden were translated into English in 1879. In 1881, he founded the world&#x27;s first open-air museum, at Bygdøy, located next to his summer residence near Oslo (then known as Christiania). In 1885, he published his &quot;Address to the Academy of Music&quot;, and a translation of one of his essays on music appeared in &quot;Literature&quot; in May 1900. He had a valuable collection of printed and manuscript music, which was readily accessible to the historical student of music.

Being a theater lover, he commissioned a new opera house to be built by Axel Anderberg for the Royal Swedish Opera which was inaugurated on 19 September 1898. It remains as the home of that institution.
Oscar II once told playwright Henrik Ibsen that his &quot;Ghosts&quot; was &quot;not a good play&quot;. As he was dying, he requested that the theatres not be closed on account of his death. His wishes were respected.

Oscar was also particularly interested in mathematics. In 1887, he set up a contest, to be awarded on the occasion of his 60th birthday in 1889, for &quot;an important discovery in the realm of higher mathematical analysis&quot;. The contest listed four potential areas of research, one of which was the n-body problem in celestial mechanics, relevant to the stability of the solar system. Henri Poincare, a professor at the University of Paris, won by submitting an entry showing that even the 3-body problem was unstable, the seminal result in what is now called chaos theory.

King Oscar II was an enthusiast of Arctic exploration. Along with Swedish millionaire Oscar Dickson and Russian magnate Aleksandr Mikhaylovich Sibiryakov, he was the patron of a number of pioneering Arctic expeditions in the 1800s. Among the ventures the king sponsored, the most important are Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld&#x27;s explorations to the Russian Arctic and Greenland, and Fridtjof Nansen&#x27;s Polar journey on the &quot;Fram&quot;.

Oscar was also a generous sponsor of the sciences and personally funded the Vega Expedition, which was the first Arctic expedition to navigate through the Northeast Passage, the sea route between Europe and Asia through the Arctic Ocean, and the first voyage to circumnavigate Eurasia.

==Death==
The political events which led up to the peaceful dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 could hardly have been attained but for the tact and patience of the king himself. He was dethroned on 7 June 1905 by the Storting and renounced the Norwegian throne on 26 October. He declined, indeed, to permit any prince of his house to become king of Norway, but better relations between the two countries were restored before his death. Oscar II died in Stockholm on 8 December 1907 at 9:10 am.

==Marriage and children==

On 6 June 1857, he married in Wiesbaden-Biebrich, Duchy of Nassau (located in present-day Hessen, Germany) Princess Sophia Wilhelmina, the youngest daughter of Duke William of Nassau and Princess Pauline of Württemberg. They had four sons:

# King Gustaf V (16 June 1858 – 29 October 1950)
# Prince Oscar, Duke of Gotland, later known as Prince Oscar Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg (15 November 1859 – 4 October 1953)
# Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland (27 February 1861 – 24 October 1951)
# Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke (1 August 1865 – 17 August 1947)

His eldest son Gustaf was Duke of Värmland and succeeded him as King Gustaf V of Sweden from 1907 until 1950, married Princess Victoria of Baden and they had three sons. His second son, Prince Oscar, lost his rights of succession to the throne upon his unequal marriage in 1888 to a former lady-in-waiting, Ebba Munck af Fulkila, and was granted the title of Prince Bernadotte first in Sweden, and from 1892 in Luxembourg, where he also was created Count of Wisborg as an hereditary title for his marital progeny (Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, was the half-brother of his mother, Queen Sophia). The other sons of Oscar II were Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland who married Princess Ingeborg of Denmark; and Prince Eugén, Duke of Närke, who was well known as an artist and remained a bachelor all his life.

===Alleged extramarital children===

Oscar II is also suspected to have had several extramarital children, of which at least five are named:
* Anna Hofman-Uddgren (1868–1947) by Emma Hammarström (1849–1910)
* Elin Esping Smitz (1878–1960) by Paulina Mathilda Esping (1858–1878)
* Knut August Ekstam (born 1878, in U.S.A. 1903, death unknown) by Marie Friberg (1852–1934) 
* Florence Stephens (1881–1979) by Elisabeth Kreüger Stephens (1858–1911)
* Nils Teodor Ekstam (1889–1954) also by Friberg above

However, unlike his father, Oscar II never officially recognized any illegitimate children of his.

;Foreign
==Legacy==
The name and portrait of Oscar II have been used as a trademark for King Oscar sardines in Norway since 1902 (which remains the only brand to have once obtained his &quot;royal permission&quot;
) as well as gingerbread cookies (&quot;pepparkakor&quot;) and other bakery products made by Göteborgs Kex in Sweden.

The culinary creation Veal Oscar was named in his honor supposedly for his fondness for its ingredients: veal cutlet, crab meat, Béarnaise sauce, and asparagus.

Located in the fictional city of Ankh-Morpork, the UU is staffed by mostly indolent and inept old wizards. The university&#x27;s name is a pun on the Invisible College, and many aspects of the university are references to Oxford and Cambridge University. The exploits of the head wizards of the Unseen University are one of the main plot threads in the long-running fantasy series, and have played a central role in 13 novels to date, as well as the four supplementary &quot;Science of Discworld&quot; novels and the short story, &quot;A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices&quot;.

== Staff ==
The staff usually come in a group in the books in which they appear, though Rincewind initially followed his own storyline, only being a part of the group in the &quot;Science of Discworld&quot; books and &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;, and the Librarian makes solo appearances in several books. Ridcully and Ponder also appeared in &quot;Going Postal&quot; and &quot;Night Watch&quot;. Ridcully alone appears in &quot;Thud!&quot;. The wizards are referred to by their offices (e.g. &quot;ancient runes&quot;), rather than names. There is a slight reference to this in &quot;The Last Continent&quot;, when the wizards notice that they not only don&#x27;t know the Librarian&#x27;s name, but they also don&#x27;t know the names of one another. In &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;, Ridcully has difficulty remembering the Dean&#x27;s name, despite having started at UU around the same time.

===Archchancellor===
The head of Unseen University is the archchancellor, considered an important figure and holds a seat on the Ankh-Morpork council, in which he acts as a magical advisor to the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork.

The archchancellor of UU is considered the leader of all wizards on the Disc (by those at the UU), the first among equals. Unseen University has existed for thousands of years, and the average Archchancellor remains in office for about eleven months.

As of the final novel, the archchancellor is Mustrum Ridcully who assumed the post in &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; and held it for the rest of the novels.

At the time he became archchancellor, Ridcully had not been seen at the university for forty years, having left the university to look after his family&#x27;s land.

Ridcully has shown the occasional flash of magical skill. For example, in &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, the Bursar is surprised to discover Ridcully&#x27;s adeptness at using a magic mirror, which, like most Discworld scrying devices, is hard to steer. In &quot;Soul Music&quot; Ridcully improvises, at short notice and with minimal assistance, a slimmed-down version of the rite of AshkEnte for summoning Death. It is also implied that he has some degree of practical magic knowledge (&quot;The Last Continent&quot;).

&quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; reveals that he and a young Esme Weatherwax were in a relationship some fifty years before Ridcully became Archchancellor. He is deeply affected by her death (&quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;).

In the Cosgrove Hall animation of &quot;Soul Music&quot; he was voiced by Graham Crowden.
In 2006&#x27;s two-part adaptation of &quot;Hogfather&quot; he was played by Joss Ackland, 
and in the 2010 adaptation of &quot;Going Postal&quot; he was portrayed by Timothy West.

===Bursar===
Professor A.A. Dinwiddie. The Bursar is a quiet, reserved person. He took over the job from the previous Bursar, Spelter, after the latter was killed trying to save the library from destruction in &quot;Sourcery&quot;.

Dinwiddie reacts to the stress of the events in the series by becoming less and less tethered to reality. By the events of &quot;Reaper Man&quot;, Dr. Dinwiddie is almost completely insensible. The Bursar&#x27;s insanity has become a byword in Ankh-Morpork: &quot;to go Bursar&quot; is &quot;to go crazy&quot;.

===Dean===
The Dean of Pentacles/Archchancellor Henry of Brazeneck College. An obese man (&quot;Moving Pictures&quot;) who is generally found in his study reading a grimoire or in the great hall. He attends some of the functions that are held by guilds or clubs around the city on behalf of the university.

According to Ponder Stibbons, he is &quot;normally never nice&quot;. He is often susceptible to any occult or semi-magical occurrence happening in the university, as well as any fads or trends – most notably in &quot;Soul Music&quot;. When roused into action he can be very enthusiastic and violent, and is a part-time Watch Special Constable – on the proviso that he not use magic in the course of his duties.

He and Archchancellor Ridcully have been friends since their first days at the university. Their friendship is tested in &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;, when the Dean leaves to become Archchancellor of the rival Brazeneck College. The Dean became the first person to voluntarily resign from the university – something previously considered unthinkable (as people usually left &quot;in disgrace, in a box or, in a few cases, in bits&quot;).

===Librarian===

The Librarian appeared in the second novel of the series, &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, where he was transformed into an orang-utan.
This had certain advantages for a librarian, such as being able to use his hands and feet for re-shelving books. The other wizards have gradually become used to the situation, to the extent that, from &quot;Night Watch&quot;: &quot;if someone ever reported that there was an orang-utan in the Library, the wizards would probably go and ask the Librarian if he&#x27;d seen it.&quot;

He is known for his violent reaction to most people calling him a &quot;monkey&quot;, as he is technically an ape. He primarily uses the word &quot;Ook&quot;, inflected for simple affirmations and negations, though he occasionally uses &quot;Eeek&quot; in moments of panic or rage. Nonetheless, most people seem able to understand him.

As with other members of the UU faculty, the Librarian is referred to by his office and not by a name. There are rumours that, pre-transformation, he was named Dr. Horace Worblehat, though no one speaks about it.

The Librarian is a member of the Librarians of Time And Space, a group who have the knowledge and ability to travel through L-Space, an extradimensional space that connects all libraries and other large accumulations of books.

The Librarian appears in orangutan form in the video games &quot;Discworld&quot; and &quot;Discworld II&quot;. In the 2008 TV adaptation of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot; by Sky One, he appears in both human and orang-utan form. His human form is played by Nicolas Tennant, who had previously played Corporal Nobbs in &quot;Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Hogfather&quot;.

===Ponder Stibbons===
Professor Stibbons is, among other things, Head of Inadvisably Applied Magic, Praelector and Reader in Invisible Writings, the Master of Traditions, the Camerlengo of Unseen University, the keeper of Hex (the university&#x27;s computer), and the right-hand man of Archchancellor Ridcully.

His entry in &quot;The New Discworld Companion&quot; states:
:originally rather lazy by nature, he seems to have blossomed to become the youngest and most depressingly keen member of the faculty ... as one of the few wizards at the University with his head screwed on in any fashion, he appears, quite against his will, to be in the front line.

In the film version of &quot;Hogfather&quot; he is portrayed by Ed Coleman.

Stibbons also appears in the video game &quot;Discworld II&quot;, in the High Energy Facility. He is characterized differently than in the books, evidenced by his erratic speech patterns and verbal tics, as well as his denials that he is being adversely affected by working on Hex.

===Rincewind===

Rincewind holds the Chair of Experimental Serendipity, the Chair for the Public Misunderstanding of Magic, and the positions of Professor of Virtual Anthropology, Egregious Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography, Reader in Slood Dynamics, Fretwork Teacher, Lecturer in Approximate Accuracy, and Health and Safety Officer. These apparently unwanted positions were awarded to Rincewind provided that he does not receive any salary. Prior to receiving these titles, Rincewind held the post of Assistant Librarian, but it is unclear whether or not he retains the office. Rincewind is often concerned with his life, as many people all across Discworld have attempted to take it.

In the film version of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; he is portrayed by David Jason.

===Doctor Hix===
 Dr. John Hix – &#x27;Hicks with an X&#x27; in &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;, after changing his name from Hicks because it didn&#x27;t suit his position. Dr Hix is a necromancer. Since necromancy is officially banned in Ankh-Morpork, he is instead the Head of the Department of Postmortem Communications (although he acknowledges this is just a fancy way of saying necromancy). Hix has one member of staff, a reanimated skeleton called Charlie. He previously had another member of staff, the late Professor Flead, but Hix bound him to a club at the end of &quot;Making Money&quot;.

Hix frequently misbehaves, performs evil deeds and makes comments in bad taste as he is required to under university statute, a fact which the other members of UU grudgingly accept. He uses the phrase &quot;Skull ring, remember?&quot; as an excuse for his misbehavior, much like the Patrician&#x27;s use of the phrase, &quot;Tyrant, remember?&quot;.

Hix may be a parody of Peter Higgs.

===Hex===
Hex is the UU&#x27;s first mainframe computer, though instead of RAM, it is powered by a waterwheel inside a ram skull, and its mouse is an actual mouse. Its &quot;brain&quot; consists of a series of glass tubes filled with ants, which form its processor, and a beehive in a back room, which constitutes its hard drive. It bears a sticker up front saying that there is an anthill inside (a parody of the advertising slogan &quot;Intel Inside&quot;). Initially just a computer, it has gradually developed more of a personality over the course of the series. Ponder Stibbons has by default become the person in charge of developing and operating Hex, though he admits that Hex largely develops itself.

=== Past archchancellors ===

* Alberto Malich, the first archchancellor and founder of UU. He went to the land of Death when he performed the Rite of AshkEnte backwards, and remained in Death&#x27;s Domain as Death&#x27;s assistant and butler. He also appeared in &quot;Mort&quot;, &quot;Soul Music&quot;, and in &quot;Hogfather&quot; where he appeared as Pixie Albert to Death&#x27;s Hogfather. In the film version of &quot;Hogfather&quot; he is portrayed by David Jason.
* Chancellor Galder Weatherwax, a distant cousin of Granny Weatherwax, is chancellor for the first half of &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;. He is the 304th Chancellor of the university. In the film version of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; he is portrayed by James Cosmo.
* Archchancellor Ymper Trymon is archchancellor for the second half of &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;. In the film version of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; he is portrayed by Tim Curry.

Others include Cutangle (&quot;Equal Rites&quot;), Virrid Wayzygoose (&quot;Sourcery&quot;), Ezrolith Churn (&quot;Eric&quot;), Sloman, who discovered the Special Theory of Slood, and Preserved Bigger (&quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;).

=== Past students ===
* Eskarina Smith, known as Esk, is the main character in &quot;Equal Rites&quot;, and was the Unseen University&#x27;s first and only known female graduate. She did not appear again in the series until &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, in which she was described as being both old and young due to her mastery of time travel. She becomes a close friend of the adult Tiffany Aching. Esk is mentioned briefly again in &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot; with an (unnamed) son.
* Victor Tugelbend (in &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;)
* Adrian Turnipseed (appears in &quot;Soul Music&quot;, &quot;The Last Continent&quot;, &quot;Hogfather&quot; and others). In &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;, Adrian Turnipseed was working for Braseneck College.
* Mr. Sideney, a member of Teatime&#x27;s gang. In the film adaptation of &quot;Hogfather&quot;, the character is portrayed by Nigel Planer.

===Past wizards===

* Drum Billet, a wizard appearing in &quot;Equal Rites&quot;, later reincarnated as an ant living under Unseen University.
* Windle Poons, a very old wizard, first appearing in &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;. He died at the age of 130, before returning briefly as a zombie.

<text>Gustaf V (Oscar Gustaf Adolf; 16 June 1858 – 29 October 1950) was King of Sweden from 8 December 1907 until his death in 1950. He was the eldest son of King Oscar II of Sweden and Sophia of Nassau, a half-sister of Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Reigning from the death of his father Oscar II in 1907 to his own death nearly 43 years later, he holds the record of being the oldest monarch of Sweden with the third-longest reign after Magnus IV (1319–1364) and his own great-grandson, Carl XVI Gustaf (1973–present). He was also the last Swedish monarch to exercise his royal prerogatives, which largely died with him, although they were formally abolished only with the remaking of the Swedish constitution in 1974. He was the first Swedish king since the High Middle Ages not to have a coronation and so never wore the king&#x27;s crown, a practice that has continued ever since.

Gustaf&#x27;s early reign saw the rise of parliamentary rule in Sweden although the leadup to World War I induced his dismissal of Liberal Prime Minister Karl Staaff in 1914, replacing him with his own figurehead, Hjalmar Hammarskjöld, the father of Dag Hammarskjöld, for most of the war. However, after the Liberals and Social Democrats secured a parliamentary majority under Staaff&#x27;s successor, Nils Edén, he allowed Edén to form a new government which &quot;de facto&quot; stripped the monarchy of virtually all powers and enacted universal and equal suffrage, including for women, by 1919. Bowing to the principles of parliamentary democracy, he remained a popular figurehead for the remaining 31 years of his rule, although not completely without influence. Gustaf V had pro-German and anti-Communist stances which were outwardly expressed during World War I and the Russian Civil War. During World War II, he allegedly urged Per Albin Hansson&#x27;s coalition government to accept requests from Nazi Germany for logistics support, arguing that refusing might provoke an invasion. His intervention remains controversial.

An avid hunter and sportsman, Gustaf presided over the 1912 Olympic Games and chaired the Swedish Association of Sports from 1897 to 1907. Most notably, he represented Sweden (under the alias of &quot;Mr G.&quot;) as a competitive tennis player, keeping up competitive tennis until his eighties, when his eyesight deteriorated rapidly. He was succeeded by his son, Gustaf VI Adolf.

==Early life==

===First years===

Gustaf V was born on 16 June 1858 in Drottningholm Palace in Ekerö, Stockholm County, the son of Prince Oscar, Duke of Östergötland and Princess Sofia of Nassau. His father was a younger son of the reigning king, Oscar I, and as the king&#x27;s eldest son, Crown Prince Charles had no surviving sons, it could be expected that the new-born prince would one day inherit the Swedish throne. At birth he was created Duke of Värmland, and on 12 July he was baptised &quot;Oscar Gustaf Adolf&quot; at the Royal Chapel of the Stockholm Palace by the Archbishop of Uppsala, Henrik Reuterdahl.

The following year, his brother Prince Oscar was born, followed by Prince Carl in 1861, and Prince Eugen in 1865. The family lived in the Arvfurstens palats (&quot;Palace of the Hereditary Prince&quot;), an 18th-century palace located at Gustav Adolfs torg in central Stockholm, and the summers were spent at Sofiero Castle near Helsingborg in Scania, which the father acquired in 1864. During his early years, the prince was considered to have a weak body constitution, and as a consequence he was treated with electrotherapy on 10 May 1871.

The three eldest princes began their schooling at the newly founded Beskowska School in Östermalm in Stockholm in October 1869. Among the prince&#x27;s classmates at the school was Hjalmar Branting, who went on to become leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and three times Prime Minister of Sweden.

===Crown Prince===
On 18 September 1872 his uncle King Charles XV died, and Gustaf&#x27;s father ascended the throne as King Oscar II. Upon his father&#x27;s accession to the throne, Gustaf became crown prince of both Sweden and Norway at the age of 14. The new king and queen and their children now moved into the large Stockholm Palace, and the crown prince&#x27;s schooling at the Beskowska School was interrupted, as he was now to receive his education as heir to the throne at the palace.
On 20 September 1881 in Karlsruhe, Germany, he married Princess Victoria of Baden, the only daughter of Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden and Princess Louise of Prussia.

On 8 December 1907 King Oscar II died and the 49-year-old Gustaf succeeded his father as King of Sweden as the fifth monarch from the House of Bernadotte.

==Public life==
When he ascended the throne, Gustaf V was, at least on paper, a near-autocrat. The 1809 Instrument of Government made the King both head of state and head of government, and ministers were solely responsible to him. However, his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament in 1905. Since then, prime ministers had been &quot;de facto&quot; required to have the confidence of the Riksdag to stay in office.

Early in his reign, in 1910, Gustaf V refused to grant clemency to the convicted murderer Johan Alfred Ander, who thus became the last person to be executed in Sweden.

At first Gustaf V seemed to be willing to accept parliamentary rule. After the Liberals won a massive landslide victory in 1911, Gustaf appointed Liberal leader Karl Staaff as Prime Minister. However, during the run-up to World War I, the elites objected to Staaff&#x27;s defence policy. In February 1914, a large crowd of farmers gathered at the royal palace and demanded that the country&#x27;s defences be strengthened. In his reply, the so-called Courtyard Speech—which was actually written by explorer Sven Hedin, an ardent conservative—Gustaf promised to strengthen the country&#x27;s defences. Staaff was outraged, telling the King that parliamentary rule called for the Crown to stay out of partisan politics. He was also angered that he had not been consulted in advance of the speech. However, Gustaf retorted that he still had the right to &quot;communicate freely with the Swedish people&quot;. The Staaff government resigned in protest, and Gustaf appointed a government of civil servants headed by Hjalmar Hammarskjöld (father of future UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld) in its place.


The 1917 elections showed a heavy gain for the Liberals and Social Democrats, who between them held a decisive majority. Despite this, Gustaf initially tried to appoint a Conservative government headed by Johan Widén. However, Widén was unable to attract enough support for a coalition. It was now apparent that Gustaf could no longer appoint a government entirely of his own choosing, nor could he keep a government in office against the will of Parliament. With no choice but to appoint a Liberal as prime minister, he appointed a Liberal-Social Democratic coalition government headed by Staaff&#x27;s successor as Liberal leader, Nils Edén. The Edén government promptly arrogated most of the king&#x27;s political powers to itself and enacted numerous reforms, most notably the institution of complete (male and female) universal suffrage in 1918–1919. While Gustaf still formally appointed the ministers, they now had to have the confidence of Parliament. He was now also bound to act on the ministers&#x27; advice. Although the provision in the Instrument of Government stating that &quot;the King alone shall govern the realm&quot; remained unchanged, the king was now bound by convention to exercise his powers through the ministers. Thus, for all intents and purposes, the ministers did the actual governing. While ministers were already legally responsible to the Riksdag under the Instrument of Government, it was now understood that they were politically responsible to the Riksdag as well. Gustaf accepted his reduced role, and reigned for the rest of his life as a model limited constitutional monarch. Parliamentarianism had become a &quot;de facto&quot; reality in Sweden, even if it would not be formalised until 1974, when a new Instrument of Government stripped the monarchy of even nominal political power. Gustaf V was considered to have German sympathies during World War I. His political stance during the war was highly influenced by his wife, who felt a strong connection to her German homeland. On 18 December 1914, he sponsored a meeting in Malmö with the other two kings of Scandinavia to demonstrate unity. Another of Gustaf V&#x27;s objectives was to dispel suspicions that he wanted to bring Sweden into the war on Germany&#x27;s side.

Although effectively stripped of political power, Gustaf was not completely without influence. In 1938, for instance, he personally summoned the German ambassador to Sweden and told him that if Hitler attacked Czechoslovakia over its refusal to give up the Sudetenland, it would trigger a world war that Germany would almost certainly lose. Additionally, his long reign gave him great moral authority as a symbol of the nation&#x27;s unity.

==Nazi connections==

Both the King and his grandson Prince Gustaf Adolf socialised with Nazi leaders before World War II, though arguably for diplomatic purposes. During a visit to Berlin, according to historian Jörgen Weibull, Gustaf V attempted to convince Hitler to soften his persecution of the Jews. He was also noted for appealing to Miklós Horthy, leader of the Kingdom of Hungary, to save its Jews &quot;in the name of humanity&quot;.

When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Gustaf V tried to write a private letter to Hitler thanking him for taking care of the &quot;Bolshevik pest&quot; and congratulating him on his &quot;already achieved victories&quot;. He was stopped from doing so by Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson.

During the war Gustaf V invited Swedish Nazi leader Sven Olov Lindholm to Stockholm Palace. The King had friends in Lindholm&#x27;s movement.

===Midsummer crisis 1941===
According to Prime Minister Hansson, during the Midsummer crisis, the King in a private conversation had threatened to abdicate if the government did not approve a German request to transfer a German infantry division, the so-called Engelbrecht Division, through Swedish territory from southern Norway to northern Finland in June 1941, around Midsummer. The accuracy of the claim is debated, and the King&#x27;s intention, if he really made the threat, is sometimes alleged to be his desire to avoid conflict with Germany. The event has received considerable attention from Swedish historians and is known as &quot;midsommarkrisen&quot;, the Midsummer Crisis.

Confirmation of the King&#x27;s action is contained in German Foreign Policy documents captured at the end of the war. On 25 June 1941, the German Ambassador in Stockholm sent a &quot;Most Urgent–Top Secret&quot; message to Berlin in which he stated that the King had just informed him that the transit of German troops would be allowed. He added: The King&#x27;s words conveyed the joyful emotion he felt. He had lived through anxious days and had gone far in giving his personal support to the matter. He added confidentially that he had found it necessary to go so far as to mention his abdication.

==Personal life==
Gustaf V was thin, and known for his height. He wore pince-nez eyeglasses and sported a pointed mustache for most of his teen years.

Gustaf V was a devoted tennis player, appearing under the pseudonym &quot;Mr G&quot;. As a player and promoter of the sport, he was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1980. The King learned to play tennis during a visit in Britain in 1876 and founded Sweden&#x27;s first tennis club on his return home. In 1936 he founded the King&#x27;s Club. During his reign, Gustaf was often seen playing on the Riviera. On a visit to Berlin, Gustaf went straight from a meeting with Hitler to a tennis match with the Jewish player Daniel Prenn. During World War II, he interceded to obtain better treatment for Davis Cup star Jean Borotra of France, and in 1938 on behalf of his personal trainer and friend Baron Gottfried von Cramm of Germany, who had been imprisoned by the Nazi Government on the charge of a homosexual relationship with a Jew.

===Haijby affair===
Allegations of a love affair between Gustaf V and Kurt Haijby led to the court paying 170,000 kronor under the threat of blackmail by Haijby. That led to the so-called Haijby Affair and several controversial trials and convictions against Haijby, which spawned considerable controversy about Gustaf V&#x27;s alleged homosexuality.

In 2021 the alleged events surrounding the Haijby Affair were adapted into a fictional miniseries for Sveriges Television called &quot;En Kunglig Affär (A Royal Secret)&quot;, directed by Lisa James Larsson and written by Bengt Braskered.

==Death==
After a reign of nearly 43 years, Gustaf V died in Stockholm of acute bronchitis with bronchiectasis on 29 October 1950. His 67-year-old son Gustaf succeeded him as Gustaf VI Adolf.

<doc id="104660" wikidata="Q67163" url="?curid=104660" title="Crossville, Alabama">
<text>Crossville is a town in DeKalb County, Alabama, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 1,862, up from 1,431 in 2000. Crossville is located atop Sand Mountain, a southern extension of the Cumberland Plateau.

==History==
Crossville is a farming community in northeast Alabama, situated on the sandstone plateau of Sand Mountain. The native peoples called the plateau Raccoon Mountain. It holds some historical significance for having figured tangentially in the Creek War.. The area&#x27;s soil, game, climate, and proximity to streams proved attractive to settlers, the majority of whom were drawn there from neighboring states following the expulsion of the indigenous Creeks..

Sand Mountain lay in an area that included disputed borders between the Creeks and the Cherokee. Although Alabama became a state in 1819, until the 1830s much of northern Alabama was still officially Cherokee territory. However, white settlement in the area increased steadily, coming to a head with the gold rush in the nearby mountains of northwest Georgia. While gold supplies began to dwindle, soon eclipsed by the California Gold Rush, the settlement by white farmers continued and played prominently in the expulsion of Cherokee, Creek and Choctaw nations from the area. That expulsion is called the Trail of Tears, considered an act of genocide because of the thousands who died on the journey, and the forced removal of native peoples from their home territories. (In nearby Fort Payne, which lies across the valley and at the foot of next-door Lookout Mountain, there is a historical sign marking the town as one of the starting points for the Trail of Tears, and also the area where Sequoyah lived, who developed the Cherokee alphabet.)

During the times of slavery, Crossville, Sand Mountain and DeKalb County, where Crossville is located, were not major slave areas. This can be verified by a study of census rolls which reveal a mostly poor area, where people worked and survived by the labor of their own hands, rather than the forced labor of captive Africans and their descendants. Leading up to the Civil War, DeKalb County was typical of Southern mountain counties in that it voted against secession from the United States. This can be corroborated by a study of the roster of the votes on this issue, county by county. In fact, there was serious discussion among Northern Alabama and East Tennessee counties about forming a proposed state of Nickajack, rather than going along with secession.

During the Civil War, DeKalb County families, particularly families from mountain terrains such as Sand and Lookout Mountain, tended at first to avoid fighting, since it was considered a &quot;rich man&#x27;s war&quot;, and not of particular interest to mountain people. However, as the war progressed, many DeKalb County families fought for Union cavalries, notably the 1st Tennessee &amp; Alabama Independent Vidette Cavalry and the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment. A perusal of the cavalries&#x27; rosters will reveal family names that to this day are prominent in the area. The First Alabama Cavalry was particularly notable in that it was one of the few units that was racially integrated.

Crossville&#x27;s name, given to it by James A. Copeland (1880–1964), not to be confused with the outlaw James Copeland), was meant to reflect its many crossroads.

In the mid-19th century, mail was brought through Crossville from Rome, Georgia, and Guntersville, Alabama, via stagecoach. Soon the town had its first U.S. post office, with A.C. Copeland serving as the first postmaster. In 1888, George Wyatt Justice established the first business in Crossville, and in 1903, W.B. Jones installed machinery for his cotton mills. His son Loy Jones (spouse-Sara Jones) followed his footsteps and ran a once successful business in Crossville. Loy and Sara had a daughter named Pam, and she had two sons named Blake and Blane Raley. The Jones family was vital to the growth early on in Crossville.

The first church established in the Crossville area was a Methodist Episcopal Church called Pine Bark Church, formed just prior to the Civil War. The community&#x27;s first Baptist church was established in 1892 at Union Grove east of the town center. In 1925, several people started meeting at the high school and formed the First Baptist Church of Crossville. A new sanctuary was built in 1926.

Crossville established its first school, a one-room structure with a single teacher and approximately 50 students, in the late 19th century at Bryant&#x27;s Chapel Church. The first banking institution was established in 1914 by N.W. Black and Boyce Rains. Soon after, Crossville was granted provisional incorporation, and Charlie J. Crump was appointed first mayor. Little progress was made during his tenure, and the incorporation&#x27;s dissolution followed quickly thereafter. The town was incorporated a second time on December 21, 1942. Dr. Luther F. Erwin was chosen mayor, and the town government established ordinances and levied privilege licenses. Collection enforcement was lax, however, resulting in insufficient resources to maintain basic town services. Following this, C.W. (Bill) Russell was elected mayor. He hired Colonel Mack Kilcrease as a legal adviser to mayor and council. This group worked together to establish a solid town government with taxation, collection and basic town services that would become the foundation for the Town of Crossville.

<text>Fort Payne is a city in and county seat of DeKalb County, in northeastern Alabama, United States. It is near Lookout Mountain. At the 2020 census, the population was 14,877.

This city developed around a fort of the same name, built in the 1830s to intern the Cherokee tribe who were being rounded up by the military before being forcibly removed to Indian Territory in 1838 on what they called the Trail of Tears.

European-American settlers gradually developed a community around the former fort. It grew rapidly in the late 19th century based on industrial resources, and manufacturing increased in the early 20th century. At the beginning of the 21st century, it still had 7000 workers in 100 mills producing varieties of socks, nearly half the world production. The volume of production has declined because of competition from China.

==History==
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, this was the site of Willstown, an important town of the Lower Cherokee. They had moved south along the Tennessee River and into what became Alabama in an effort to escape European-American pressure.

For a time this was the home of Sequoyah, a silversmith who by 1821 created the Cherokee syllabary, one of the few writing systems created by an individual from a pre-literate culture. In Alabama, his people soon started publishing the first newspaper in Cherokee and English, &quot;The Cherokee Phoenix&quot;.

This settlement was commonly called Willstown after its headman, Will Weber, who had striking red hair. He was the son of Cherokee and German parents and raised as Cherokee.

John Norton, a man born in Scotland about 1770 to Scottish and Cherokee parents, visited this area and other parts of the Cherokee homeland in 1809-1810. He had come to North America as a British soldier and became close to Mohawk people at the Grand River Reserve in Ontario, where he served as an interpreter.

During the 1830s prior to Indian removal, the US Army under command of Major John Payne built a fort near Willstown to intern Cherokee from Alabama until they were forcibly removed to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Their forced exile became known as the Trail of Tears. Only a chimney of Fort Payne still stands in the downtown of the city that developed around it.

===19th-20th century growth===
Although European Americans had pressed for Indian removal in the Southeast because they wanted land to cultivate, by the 1860s, the city of Fort Payne and the surrounding area were only sparsely settled. Development of cotton plantations and larger settlements had taken place in the uplands region known as the Black Belt. With no strategic targets nearby, during the Civil War only minor skirmishes between Union and Confederate forces took place here. About the time of the Second Battle of Chattanooga, a large Union force briefly entered the county, but it did not engage substantial Confederate forces.

In 1878 the city Fort Payne was designated as the county seat, and in 1889 it was incorporated as a town. The community of Lebanon had served as the DeKalb county seat since 1850. With the completion of rail lines between Birmingham and Chattanooga that went through Fort Payne, the city&#x27;s growth was stimulated by connection to this new transportation route. County sentiment had supported having the seat in a community served by the railroad, seen as key to the future.

In the late 1880s, Fort Payne&#x27;s growth was stimulated after the discovery of coal and iron deposits, needed to support industrialization. Investors and especially workers from New England and the North flooded into the region for new jobs. This period is called the &quot;Boom Days&quot;, or simply the &quot;Boom&quot;.

Many of the notable historic buildings in Fort Payne date from this period of economic growth and prosperity, including the state&#x27;s oldest standing theater, the Fort Payne Opera House; the former factory of the Hardware Manufacturing Company (today known as the W. B. Davis Mill Building, now the location of the Fort Payne Depot Museum, and formerly the passenger station for the present-day Norfolk Southern Railway. Following the decline of passenger traffic in the mid-20th century as people took to automobiles, today the depot serves as a museum of local history.

The iron and coal deposits were much smaller than expected. Many of the promoters left the region for Birmingham, Alabama, which became the state&#x27;s major industrial city. Fort Payne suffered a period of economic decline. In 1907, the W.B. Davis Hosiery Mill began operations, processing area cotton to produce socks and hosiery. Hosiery manufacture has led the economy in Fort Payne. At the beginning of the 21st century, the hosiery industry in Fort Payne employed over 7,000 people in more than 100 mills. It produced more than half of the socks made in the United States and claimed to be the &quot;Sock Capital of the World.&quot;

Beginning in the 1990s, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Central American Free Trade Agreement lowered tariffs on textile products imported into the United States, resulting in large increases in sock imports. By the early 2000s a very large, highly-efficient centre for sock production had grown up around Datang, Zhuji in Zhejiang Province, China. Raw materials and hosiery machines were also manufactured at Datang. While in Fort Payne a company might have to wait two months for a replacement part for a hosiery machine to arrive from Italy, a manufacturer in Datang would have to wait half an hour for the part to arrive from a local company.

American multinational retail corporations began to source hosiery products from Datang. The American companies’ strict negotiating positions required the Datang producers to accept as little as 3% profit. As American retail corporations began to source their products from China, Datang became the new &quot;Sock Capital of the World.&quot; Many businesses in Fort Payne accused foreign manufacturers, particularly those from China, of engaging in dumping of socks below cost to force American companies out of the sock business. By 2005, hosiery mill employment in Fort Payne had declined to around 5,500, and several mills had closed. In late 2005, the federal government gained an agreement with the Chinese government to slow the schedule for the removal of tariffs, delaying their full removal until 2008. The hosiery industry continues to have a foothold in the community, diversifying from athletic socks to boutique designs such as Zkano, and other specialty and medical socks.

In the 1990s, facing the international threat to their manufacturing, business and civic leaders in Fort Payne began to take steps to diversify the city&#x27;s economy. Several new commercial and industrial projects were developed. The largest was the 2006 construction of a distribution center for The Children&#x27;s Place stores, a facility that employed 600 people in its first phase of operation.

Other large corporations represented in Fort Payne include Heil Environmental Industries (a division of Dover Industries, manufacturing sanitation trucks); Vulcraft (a division of Nucor Corporation, manufacturing steel roofing systems); and Game Time (a division of Playcore, manufacturing commercial playground equipment).

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.64%, is water.

The city center lies in a narrow valley on Big Wills Creek in the Cumberland Plateau region immediately west of Lookout Mountain, with Sand Mountain at a distance to the west. The city limits reach to the east and south so that more than half of the city&#x27;s area is now located on Lookout Mountain. Drainage is through Big Wills Creek to the Coosa River.

A magnitude 4.9 earthquake occurred here in 2003.

===Climate===
Fort Payne is notable for a subtropical climate. Winters usually feature measurable, though infrequent, snow. Cloudmont Ski Resort on Lookout Mountain generates man-made snow as winter temperatures permit. The area is subject to occasional tornadoes. The city&#x27;s northern side was struck by F3 and F4 tornadoes February 29, 1952 and May 19, 1973, respectively, both of which caused considerable damage. Exactly ten years later, a tornado struck the city again. In the Palm Sunday tornado outbreak of 1994, an F3 tornado passed just west of the city

Occasionally, a hurricane that has made landfall in the Gulf of Mexico will reach Fort Payne as a tropical storm or tropical depression. However, in 1995 the eye of Hurricane Opal reached Fort Payne with hurricane-force winds. The 1993 Storm of the Century dumped more than of snow on Fort Payne, immobilizing the city and the surrounding area for days. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfa&quot;. (Humid Subtropical Climate).

<text>Coosada is a town in Elmore County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 1,217. It is part of the Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
&quot;Coosawda&quot; was home to a Creek (Coushatta tribe) village called Koasati in the 18th and early 19th centuries. By invitation, many Chickamauga Cherokee followers of Dragging Canoe fled to the town during and following the American War of Independence. Coosada was the birthplace of the influential Creek leader, William Weatherford, who led the Red Stick uprising of 1813–1814. After that, the Native American population was removed to the west.

Frontiersmen from the United States quickly settled in the area. The future governor of the state of Alabama, William Wyatt Bibb, migrated to the area at that time. A land speculator from Georgia, he purchased the land that the village of Koasati occupied, and sub-divided it into lots for sale. By 1818, the town had a post office and a sawmill. Following the establishment of the train depot in 1872, the settlement was called &quot;Coosada Station.&quot; Around 1890 the town became simply &quot;Coosada.&quot;

== History ==

=== The Creek Wars and Indian removal ===

The historic Creek peoples in this area are believed to have descended from the Mississippian culture, which flourished throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys and the Southeast from about 1000 to 1450. They were mound builders, who created massive earthwork mounds as structures for political and religious purposes. They relied greatly on fishing and riverway trading at their major sites (c.f. Moundville, Tuscaloosa).

Talisi (which means &quot;Old Town&quot; in the Creek language) was a town of the Coosa Province of the Mississippian culture; it was visited in 1540 by Hernando de Soto and his expedition through the Southeast. Later it was occupied by the historic Creek people. The Tallassee area was the location of the Creek capital city, &quot;Tuckabatchee&quot;, as well as the location of the seven sacred plates.

Tensions first broke out as a civil war among the Creek, but US forces also got involved. Trying to intercept a Red Sticks party who were bringing back arms thought to be purchased from the Spanish in Florida, United States Army forces attacked the Creek at the Battle of Burnt Corn. The Creek band ultimately defeated the soldiers. In retaliation, the next month the Red Sticks attacked Fort Mims, about 35 miles north of Mobile, Alabama, killing most of the more than 500 settlers and mixed-race Lower Creek who had taken refuge there.

Osceola is believed to have been born in &quot;Talisi&quot;, to a mixed-race Creek mother and an English father. He was among those Creek who migrated to Florida after the Creek War and joined the Seminole Indians. He became a prominent leader who continued resistance to US forces and settlement. 
The Creek Wars (1813–1814) were marked by mutual raids, civilian massacres, and scalpings by both sides. The last major battle was at Horseshoe Bend in 1814 on the banks of the Tallapoosa River. Led by then-General Andrew Jackson, a coalition of militia from Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia, federal troops, Lower Creek, and Cherokee crushed the outnumbered and out-gunned Red Sticks. Jackson counted the conflict as among his politically strategic victories; it increased his popularity for later election to the presidency and his future policies of Indian removal.

After their defeat, many Creek migrated to Indian Territory, while some went into hiding with other resistant Indians in the Southeast, including the Cherokee and the Seminole tribes in Florida. The Creek who relocated from the Tuckabatchee area named a new settlement Talisi in Indian Territory. It was later known as Tulsa, Oklahoma.

===American Civil War===
&quot;Tallassee sent her fair share, and more, of her sons to fight for the Confederacy and a Tallassee textile manufacturer, Barnett, Micou, and Company, supplied cloth for Confederate uniforms and tents, leased land and a building for production of a Confederate carbine, and produced supplies, laborers, and rations for the Armory, its employees, and officers.&quot;
In June 1864 the Confederate army moved the Richmond Carbine Factory from Virginia to an old Tallassee cotton mill. It began manufacturing the carbines. During the course of the American Civil War, the town of Tallassee was never attacked by Union forces, except for their one attempt to destroy the Tallassee Mill. The Tallassee Armory was the only Confederate one not destroyed during the war.

===2009 Hotel Talisi fire===
Early in the morning of November 30, 2009, the historic Hotel Talisi was heavily damaged by a fire. The hotel, closed since 2008, was purchased by a group of seven investors in the fall of 2009. It was renovated and had been reopened for a month. The fire destroyed the hotel and a consignment shop next door.

The fire was ruled an arson and 17-year-old, Dylan Keith Carroll, pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree arson, one count of third-degree arson, two counts of third-degree burglary, and three counts of first-degree criminal mischief.

After the trial, the hotel&#x27;s owners met in March 2010 and decided to rebuild the structure. However, the building remains a crumbling eyesore as Tallassee&#x27;s downtown begins to revive around it as of 2021.

===Mills===
&quot;In 1900, the Tallassee Falls Manufacturing Company became a part of the Mount Vernon-Woodberry Cotton Duck Company. This company was formed by the consolidation of the Columbia Duck Mills, Columbia, South Carolina; the Mount Vernon Company and the Woodberry Manufacturing Company, Baltimore, Maryland: and the Tallassee Falls Manufacturing Company, Tallassee, Alabama. Besides these were included two small mills in Maryland and one in Connecticut. The new company comprises a total of fourteen plants and 227,000 spindles.&quot;
&quot;Child labor was common in the Tallassee Mills, as in thousands of American industrial plants, until the 1930s. &quot;
&quot;The Houses on King Street, numbered 1, 3, and 5, today occupied by Ray Carr, Houston Blount, and Frazier Elliot, were built about 1863 for the families of the confederate officers in charge of the armory and those in charge of the mill.&quot; The Mount Vernon Mill in Tallassee was completely destroyed by a fire on May 5, 2016.

&quot;The Tallassee National Guard Company served in World War I, and a community library was established in 1921. During WWII, the mills received awards of excellence from the U.S. Army for production of war materials.&quot;

&quot;The &quot;long bell&quot; has been rung in Tallassee at 4:30 a.m. every day except Sunday since Barnett&#x27;s time except for six months period in 1948 during which the bell tower was being repaired. Visitors who are unacquainted with Tallassee custom are sometimes startled by being awakened by the sound of the bell. They are sure there is a fire in town and that this is the alarm bell ringing. The bell ringing was really for the mills. Thomas Barnett married his cousin Miss Martha MiCou. Their sons, Thomas M., Jr. and Nicholas, lived in Tallassee, building homes on the hill above the mill. Nicholas Barnett home standing today, known as the George D. Patterson home. These families put capital in the mills known as Barnett, Gilmer and Company.&quot;

== Political history ==
Robert E (Bobby) Payne served as Tallassee&#x27;s mayor for 24 years, making him the longest-tenured mayor in the city&#x27;s history. Payne was raised in Etowah County, where he excelled as a high school football player for the Etowah County Blue Devils. He earned a football scholarship from Auburn University in 1963. After completing his eligibility he moved with his wife Mary Carroll to Tallassee, where he worked at Mount Vernon Mills. In 1976 he ran for city council. He won the council seat and served three terms before he ran for mayor in 1988. Payne won in a highly contested race against incumbent Thomas Pollard. He remained in office for 24 years before losing in 2008. He entered the race in 2012 to reclaim his seat and he won convincingly. He retired in 2016. During his time in office, Tallassee achieved more economic growth than at any other time in the city&#x27;s history. Johnny Hammock won Payne&#x27;s seat in a landslide.
Hammock - after his first term - focused on fixing the town&#x27;s crumbling infrastructure that had been long neglected. From 2016-2020 Hammock, along with a progressive council, brought in grants and funding totaling in the millions to help address the issues previously left unresolved by past administrations.

<text>Wetumpka () is a city in and the county seat of Elmore County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 7,220. In the early 21st century, Elmore County became one of the fastest-growing counties in the state. The city is considered part of the Montgomery Metropolitan Area.

Wetumpka identifies as &quot;The City of Natural Beauty&quot;. Among the notable landmarks are the Wetumpka crater and the Jasmine Hill Gardens, with a full-sized replica of the Temple of Hera of Olympia, Greece. Historic downtown Wetumpka developed on both sides of the Coosa River. It was near Fort Toulouse, built by French colonists in 1717, when they had claimed this territory for the king. In 2022, the city received worldwide ridicule after jailing two elderly women attempting to feed and neuter stray cats

==Etymology==
The placename &quot;Wetumpka&quot; is derived from the Muscogee Creek Native American language phrase &quot;we-wau&quot; &quot;tum-cau&quot; meaning &quot;rumbling waters&quot;, believed to be a description of the sound of the nearby Coosa River at the rapids of the Devil&#x27;s Staircase. The roar of the rapids reportedly could be heard for miles before the construction in the 20th century of Walter Bouldin Dam and Jordan Dam, when the river was captured as a reservoir behind the dam.

After being forced west to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma), by United States soldiers under the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Muscogee named their major settlement there Wetumka, after their historic village.

==History==

Wetumpka was long settled by the Muscogee people, whose territory extended through present-day Georgia and Alabama. Their largest towns were on the banks of the Coosa and at its confluence with the Tallapoosa River, at Wetumpka and &quot;Talisi&quot; (now Tallassee), respectively.

===French and British colonization===

After moving the 1702 settlement of Mobile to Mobile Bay in 1711, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville sent an expedition up the Alabama River to establish a fort in the interior of the colony, known as La Louisiane or New France, to stop the encroachment of British colonists and to foster trade and goodwill with the Creek.

Bienville directed the construction of Fort Toulouse along the Coosa River in 1714, above the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers and the Creek village of &quot;Taskigi&quot;. Bienville selected this area as a strategic locale for a fortification.

The French traded at Wetumpka and garrisoned Fort Toulouse until 1763, when they ceded the territory to the British following defeat in the Seven Years&#x27; War (known as the French and Indian War in North America). For nearly a quarter century, the British had control of this area. Several Scots and Irish traders, such as McGillivray and Weatherford, were active in the region. They married into the Creek matrilineal aristocracy and later claimed vast land grants. Their descendants became important Creek leaders because of their mothers&#x27; status.

===United States rule===
After Britain was defeated in the American Revolutionary War, it ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to the United States in 1783. In 1798 the US made this area part of the Mississippi Territory, after cessions from the states of Georgia and South Carolina. Between 1800 and 1812, European-American pioneers began to arrive, many with enslaved African-American laborers, and encroach on the lands of the Southeast Indian tribes.

By the early 19th century, there were tensions among the Creek, with young men of the Upper Creek promoting a revival of religion and traditional culture, and the Lower Creek, more influenced by settlement and trade with European Americans in Georgia, becoming more assimilated. In addition, in 1811, the Shawnee chief Tecumseh of the upper Northwest appealed to the Creek to join his Western Confederacy to try to drive out and exterminate the European settlers west of the Appalachians.

When the U.S. declared war on Britain in June 1812, the Upper Creek lost the assistance of the British, but they persisted with war against American settlers in the area. Upon receiving the news of the massacre at Fort Mims, whose refugees included many Lower Creek, American settlers appealed for government help. General Andrew Jackson led a militia with members from Tennessee, Mississippi, and Georgia and attacked the Creek in Alabama. The path the militia traveled became known as &quot;Jackson&#x27;s Trace&quot;.
Jackson&#x27;s forces won a decisive victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. He moved on to Fort Toulouse, where he directed its repair. During his absence, the site was renamed Fort Jackson in his honor.

Jackson made the fort his headquarters during the War of 1812. The newly created Montgomery County held its courts there. The defeated Creek were forced to sign the Treaty of Fort Jackson (1814), which ceded to the United States of Creek lands: much of the remainder of their territory in Georgia and most of central Alabama. After the war, many of Jackson&#x27;s Tennessee militia returned home, collected their families and belongings, and brought them back to settle near the fort.

===Growth and incorporation===
Settlers, mostly from Georgia and the Carolinas, flooded into the fertile land that the Creeks had been forced to give up. With its strategic location at the river confluence, Wetumpka quickly became an important center of agricultural trade. The city was formally incorporated in 1834. Cotton was the commodity crop of the new state of Alabama, with cultivation of short-staple cotton in the upland areas made possible by Eli Whitney&#x27;s invention of the cotton gin, which reduced the labor of processing. From the scattered fields and large plantations worked by slave labor in the interior, cotton was carted overland to Wetumpka. At the fall line of the Coosa River, the port shipped out cotton bales by steamboats which went downriver to the markets at Mobile for sale.
Wetumpka became a cotton boom town. The new city was divided in half. The part on the eastern bank of the river was commercial, with banks, stores, and hotels, and was located in Coosa County. The western section in Autauga County was residential, with houses and churches laid out on a grid pattern of streets.

By 1836, the city&#x27;s population was 1,200. Harper&#x27;s Weekly asserted that &quot;Wetumpka, Alabama and Chicago, Illinois are the most promising two cities of the West. The city commissioned a steamboat, &quot;The Coosa Belle&quot;, to ferry passengers and cotton between Wetumpka and Mobile.

The same forces contributing to Wetumpka&#x27;s growth were shifting the balance of power within Alabama. A standoff between the farmers of the Tennessee Valley, centered in the former capital of Huntsville, and the old mercantile wealth of Mobile, had resulted in the capital being located for many years at Tuscaloosa. By 1845, the cotton planters in the interior Black Belt had become some of the wealthiest in the country, and power was shifting toward the southern and central part of the state. Both the Black Belt cotton barons and the Mobilians wanted the capital moved.

Compromise indicated a new, centrally located capital, accessible by river and by steamboat. The lead contenders were Wetumpka (then straddling old Autauga and Coosa Counties) and the newer city of Montgomery (in Montgomery County), a few miles south. Neither city had a majority of support; representatives from north Alabama, enraged that the capital was being moved from Tuscaloosa, were indifferent to either site. Just before the vote, Montgomery lured an expensive French chef to the new hotel that had been built to house the state&#x27;s representatives if Montgomery were selected. The city distributed elegant menus to the statesmen. The promise of luxury swayed the vote, and Montgomery won. That same year, a fire broke out in Wetumpka, burning warehouses and many commercial buildings. The charred bricks were carried downriver to Montgomery to supply the building boom in Alabama&#x27;s new capital.

===War and flood===
Though their civic pride was wounded by losing the capital to Montgomery, Wetumpka&#x27;s planters and merchants continued to flourish throughout the antebellum period. They promoted a plan to build a lock and dam so that boats would be able to pass above the Fall Line and travel up the Coosa as far as Rome, Georgia. One famous resident was William Lowndes Yancey, a firebrand newspaper editor and statesman who was an influential advocate of states&#x27; rights, slavery, and Southern secession.

In February 1861, representatives from seven Southern states met in Montgomery to form the Confederate government, inaugurating Jefferson Davis as their president on the steps of the Alabama state capitol. The first six states to secede were those whose residents owned the most slaves in the South. The same year saw the majority of Wetumpka&#x27;s male population going off to war. Wetumpka was never harmed by Federal troops. No Union troops entered the area until early 1865, and they were driven to reach Montgomery to punish the former Confederate capital before the war ended.

Veterans of the war returned to a city and a region whose economy had been completely destroyed. In 1866, a Reconstruction government drew up a new plan of counties for the state, and Elmore County was created out of parts of Coosa, Autauga, and Montgomery counties, with Wetumpka as its county seat. (Rockford was chosen as seat of the &quot;new&quot; Coosa County.)

Despite this, the city&#x27;s future seemed grim. Before the war (in 1850), the population had reached 3,824 to become the 3rd largest city in the state (behind Mobile and Montgomery). By 1870 it had 1,137 residents (with Black residents outnumbering Whites by a margin of 594 to 543); in 1880, 816 residents; by 1890, it had declined to 619, and would bottom out at 562 in 1900. Not until 1950 would it return to the population it had a century earlier (with 3,813 residents).

In 1886, the worst flood in city history inundated the west bank and most of downtown. The bridge connecting the city&#x27;s two halves was washed away, and more than a year passed before it was replaced.

===Lynchings===
A number of lynchings took place in and around Wetumpka during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The largest lynching took place on June 17, 1898, when a mob of 500 described as &quot;some of the best and most prominent citizens of Elmore and Coosa counties&quot; stormed the county jail where Solomon Jackson, Camp Reese, Louis Spier and Jesse Thompson were being held. A few prominent citizens and a Methodist minister tried talking the mob away from violence but they were unsuccessful. The sheriff had hidden the jail keys so that the mob couldn&#x27;t get into the cells but they took a crowbar and took the cell doors off of their hinges and kidnapped the four men. The mob originally planned to burn them alive but thought that troops would intervene, so instead the men were hanged.

===Progress===

The first paved road linking Wetumpka with Montgomery was completed in 1924. Montgomery continued to grow during the two World Wars because of military spending in the region and the growth of the state government. By the 1950s, the ubiquity of the automobile allowed Wetumpka&#x27;s residents to commute daily to Montgomery for work.

===&quot;Cat Ladies&quot;===
In 2022, two women were arrested and charged for feeding feral cats, which is not a crime in Wetumpka. City Judge Jeff Courtney sentenced Beverly Roberts, 85, and Mary Alston, 61, each to two years of unsupervised probation and 10 days in jail. The jail sentence was suspended. They were also ordered to each pay $100 in fines, plus court costs. After sentencing the women appealed to the Elmore County Circuit Court, at which point the city decided to no longer pursuing criminal charges.

The arrests generated worldwide media coverage and opposition and resulted in Wetumpka being called a &quot;national laughing stock. If not international.&quot; Roberts and Alston were later named &quot;community heroes&quot; by The Montgomery Advertiser for helping feral cats in Wetumpka. They were also featured on an episode of A&amp;E Networks&#x27; show &quot;My Strange Arrest&quot;.

Roberts and Alston alleged that &quot;small-town politics&quot; were behind what happened, saying that Wetumpka Mayor Jerry Willis &quot;ordered Roberts&#x27; arrest because she had a history of making complaints about animal welfare matters in the city.&quot;

==Geography==
Wetumpka is located southwest of the center of Elmore County at (32.540972, −86.207726), and sits on both sides of the Coosa River northeast of its confluence with the Tallapoosa River, where they merge to become the Alabama River.

The city is situated astride the Fall Line, where the Appalachian foothills give way to the flat Gulf Coastal Plain.

The city is located along many major US and state routes, notably U.S. Route 231, which runs east of downtown, leading north to Rockford and south to downtown Montgomery. Alabama State Route 14 runs west to east through the downtown area, leading east to Tallassee and southwest to Prattville. Other state highways that run through the city include Alabama State Route 9 and Alabama State Route 170.

Downtown Wetumpka covers two city blocks, and is bordered on the northwest by the Coosa River. The Bibb Graves Bridge crosses the river here, and is the city&#x27;s most recognizable landmark. Directly across the bridge are the city&#x27;s three antebellum churches, the First Methodist, First Presbyterian, and First Baptist. On January 19, 2019, a tornado destroyed the First Presbyterian church and badly damaged the first Baptist church.

*&quot;The Rosa Parks Story&quot; (2002)
*&quot;Big Fish&quot; (2003)
*&quot;Son of the South&quot; (2020)

===Wetumpka meteor crater===
Wetumpka is the home of &quot;Alabama&#x27;s greatest natural disaster&quot;. A meteorite, estimated to be wide, hit the area about 80 million years ago. The hills just east of downtown showcase the eroded remains of a impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme (&quot;star-wound&quot;) for the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface. In 2002, Auburn University researchers published evidence and established the site as an internationally recognized impact crater. Scientists have estimated that the energy released by the impact was over 175,000 times the energy of the nuclear bomb detonated at Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.

===Jasmine Hill Gardens===

This outdoor museum was built in the 1930s on the estate of the Fitzpatrick family, who spent many years in Greece collecting replicas of ancient statuary to adorn their formal gardens at Jasmine Hill. The gardens are closed and will not re-open; they had several attractions including a full-sized replica of the Temple of Hera at Olympia.

===Outdoor recreation===

Wetumpka and the Coosa River annually play host to the Coosa River Challenge, which began in 2003 and regularly draws 150 to 200 participants. The race, a modified triathlon, starts at the Swayback Bridge Trail with a cross country run, a mountain bike leg, and paddling on the Coosa River to finish at Goldstar Park in downtown Wetumpka.

The Swayback Bridge Trail is home to the annual mountain bike race, &quot;Attack on Swayback&quot;.

Wetumpka is popular with white water sports enthusiasts, attracting paddlers from all over the country. The city hosts the annual Coosa River Whitewater Festival, and was the site of the 2005 U.S. Freestyle Kayaking Nationals. The Coosa River Paddling Club has constructed Corn Creek Park, which offers public access to the river, along with nature and walking trails.

=== Christmas on the Coosa ===
Christmas on the Coosa is an annual series of events held in during the month of December. The event location is the Bibb Graves Memorial Bridge. The main event is the fireworks display and boat show held on the Coosa River. Observers watch from the Bibb Graves Memorial Bridge as a parade of boats decorated with Christmas lights float down the river under the bridge as fireworks go off. This is a unique experience due to the glow of fireworks illuminating the night sky as well as the placid river surface. A host of events proceeds the river show such as Miss Christmas on the Coosa Pageant, Pictures with Santa, tree lighting, and other events centralized around the city&#x27;s Gold State Park.

<text>Brewton is a city in and 
the county seat of Escambia County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 5,276. Brewton is located in south central Alabama, just north of the Florida Panhandle.

Brewton was home to the Downing Industrial School, a school for girls. Brewton was ranked as one of the 100 best small towns in America in Norman Crampton&#x27;s book, &quot;The 100 Best Small Towns in America&quot; (1995).

==History==

The settlement at this site was originally known as Newport; barges made runs to and from Pensacola, Florida on Murder Creek and Burnt Corn Creek, before the railroad was constructed. In May 1861, Brewton was established as a train stop by Edmund Troupe Bruton. The area&#x27;s lumber began to be harvested by industrialists.

During the Civil War, rail lines were severed, and small lumber mills were damaged or destroyed. After the war, the people rebuilt the Brewton economy, began a school, and established small businesses. Into the 1870s a new European demand for lumber stimulated the founding of numerous timber and lumber operations. The Conecuh-Escambia river system became a timber artery to ports on the Gulf of Mexico.

Brewton was established as a town on February 13, 1885. The state legislature designated the town as the seat of Escambia County, Alabama.

Brewton was known in past times as &quot;the richest little town in the South.&quot; Brewton&#x27;s high per capita income was based on the profits enjoyed by a small number of &quot;timber barons.&quot; They had come at the end of the 19th century to harvest the pine forests. With their profits, they had extraordinary homes built along Belleville and Evergreen avenues. Such families include the McMillans, Lovelace and the Millers, many of whose descendants still reside in the town.

Over time the county erected a series of courthouses. Brewton developed an education system that included public and private institutions, including T. R. Miller High School. It was named for Thomas Richard Miller, a local timber baron and town father who donated money toward the building and opening of the school. Jefferson Davis Community College was established here in 1964; it has been renamed as Coastal Alabama Community College Brewton.

<text>Attalla is a city in Etowah County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 6,048.

== History ==

The town developed on the area of a former Muscogee (Creek) village that was important during the Creek War. Most of the Creek people were forced out under the Indian Removal Act of 1830. White European migrants from the coastal areas came into this area to acquire land. The wealthier ones developed cotton plantations based on the labor of enslaved African Americans.

Cherokee people had also lived in this area, after being encroached on in Tennessee and western North Carolina. David Brown (Cherokee) was assisted by the Rev. D. S. Butterick in preparing the &quot;Cherokee Spelling Book&quot; while he lived here.

Attalla was not founded until 1870; it was established on land donated by W. C. Hammond, a plantation owner. It was incorporated as a city government on February 5, 1872. The town was officially named &quot;Attalla&quot; in 1893, derived from the Cherokee language word &quot;otali&quot; meaning &quot;mountain&quot;.

Railroads served the town and connected it to other markets. When the railroads went into bankruptcy, Attalla&#x27;s prosperity declined in the late 19th century financial troubles.

Attalla is the site of the first hydroelectric dam constructed to provide electricity for a city; it was built in 1887.

<text>Boaz is a city in Marshall and Etowah counties in the U.S. state of Alabama. The Marshall County portion of the city is part of the Albertville Micropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 10,107. Boaz was known for its outlet shops.

==History==
First settled in the 1850s, the town of Boaz was officially founded November 11, 1878, by the Sparks family of Georgia. A post office has been in operation since 1887. The city was named after Boaz, from the Bible. It was incorporated in 1897.

Prior to World War II, Boaz hosted a primarily cotton-based economy, only diversifying to livestock and poultry with the pressures of boll weevil infestations and the Great Depression. After the war, Boaz developed a thriving automotive sales industry, which in many instances survives to this day.

In the early 1980s, the VF Corporation opened an outlet store in an abandoned factory, whose success prompted other retailers to open stores. In the late 1980s, Boaz was a tourist attraction with 130 outlet stores, attracting five million people per year. Retailers moved away from Boaz due to a dwindling customer base, dropping to 80 stores in the early 1990s, with the Great Recession of the 2000s driving away even more. In 2016, three buildings of the outlet center were demolished.

The Julia Street Memorial United Methodist Church, Snead Junior College Historic District, the Thomas A. Snellgrove Homestead and the Edward Fenns Whitman House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage lists the Boaz Elementary School, the First Baptist Church and Cemetery, and the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city of Boaz has a total area of , of which , or 0.43%, are water. Most of the city drains west to either Slab Creek or Clear Creek, tributaries of the Locust Fork of the Black Warrior River. The Tennessee Valley Divide crosses the east side of the city, with the eastern portions of the city draining to Short Creek, a north-flowing tributary of the Tennessee River.

<text>Gadsden is the county seat of Etowah County in the U.S. state of Alabama. It is located on the Coosa River about northeast of Birmingham and southwest of Chattanooga, Tennessee. It is the primary city of the Gadsden Metropolitan Statistical Area, which has a population of 103,931. The population 33,945 at the 2020 census.

In the 19th century, Gadsden was Alabama&#x27;s second-most important center of commerce and industry, trailing only the seaport of Mobile. The two cities were important shipping centers: Gadsden for riverboats and Mobile for international trade.

From the late 19th century through the 1980s, Gadsden was a center of heavy industry, including the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and Republic Steel. In 1991, following more than a decade of sharp decline in industry, Gadsden was awarded the honor of All-America City by the National Civic League.

==History==
The first substantial European-American settlement in the area that developed as Gadsden was a village called &quot;Double Springs&quot;. It was founded in about 1825 by John Riley, a mixed-race American Indian and European-American settler who built his house near two springs. Riley used his house for a stagecoach stop on the Huntsville-to-Rome route. The original building still stands as the oldest in Gadsden.

The house was purchased by brothers Gabriel and Asenath Hughes in 1840. The Hughes brothers purchased much of the land between Lookout Mountain, the Coosa River, and the mouth of Wills Creek. The brothers proposed constructing a railroad from the port of Savannah to Nashville, Tennessee through their land. The original survey of Gadsden included the Hughes brothers&#x27; land, plus that of John S. Moragne and Lewis L. Rhea.

On July 4, 1845, Captain James Lafferty piloted the steamboat &quot;Coosa&quot; to the settlement. He landed near the site where the Memorial Bridge was built. The Hughes brothers suggested renaming the town as &quot;Lafferty&#x27;s Landing&quot;, but residents adopted &quot;Gadsden&quot; in honor of Colonel James Gadsden of South Carolina. He later was noted for negotiating the United States&#x27; Gadsden Purchase from Mexico.

In 1867, after the American Civil War, the legislature organized Baine County; Gadsden was incorporated and made the county seat. After a constitutional convention, the new legislature dissolved Baine County in 1868 and renamed it as Etowah County. Gadsden retained its standing as county seat.

By the late 19th century, Gadsden had developed as a major river port on the Coosa River, and was second to Mobile, a seaport on the Gulf Coast, in importance. It also developed as a center of heavy industry.

===20th century to present===
With unionization, industrial workers could earn middle-class salaries and improve their lives, even as African Americans struggled under Jim Crow laws and political disenfranchisement. The city reached its peak of population in 1960.

Affected by the national restructuring of railroads and heavy industry, most of Gadsden&#x27;s major industries closed in the 1970s and 1980s. The city lost many jobs and much population, and began to decline. The city government has struggled to manage the transition to a different economy, just as numerous other industrial cities had to do.

Redevelopment efforts, such as the Cultural Arts Center and downtown revitalization, earned Gadsden first place in the 2000 City Livability Awards Program of the US Conference of Mayors. Underemployment continues to be a severe problem, as indicated by the economic data presented below.

==Geography and climate==
Gadsden is located in central Etowah County at (34.010147, −86.010356), and developed on both sides of the Coosa River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , is water. The southern end of Lookout Mountain rises to the north of the city center.

Typical of the Deep South, Gadsden experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) with four distinct seasons.

Winter lasts from early December to late-February; the daily average temperature in January is . On average, the low temperature falls to the freezing mark or below on 60 days a year, and to or below on 6.9 days. While rain is abundant (January and February are on average the wettest months), measurable snowfall is rare, with most years receiving none. Summers are hot and humid, lasting from mid-May to mid-September, and the July daily average temperature is . There are 60–61 days of + highs annually and 2.1 days of + highs. The latter part of summer tends to be drier. Autumn, which spans from mid-September to early-December, tends to be similar to spring in terms of temperature and precipitation, although it begins relatively dry.

With a period of record dating only back to 1953, the highest recorded temperature was on June 30, 2012, while the lowest recorded temperature was on January 20–21, 1985.

==Employment==
===Top employers===
According to the City&#x27;s 2022 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are:

Citing statistics from the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations and the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Alabama, the Gadsden-Etowah County Industrial Development Authority reports that approximately 12,000 residents of Etowah County were underemployed and 2,179 residents were unemployed as of 2008.

==Religion==
Gadsden houses numerous churches: Episcopalian, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Church of Christ, Pentecostal, Catholic, Church of the Nazarene, and Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

The city was home to Congregation Beth Israel, a Reform synagogue founded in 1908. In a 1960 attack, the synagogue was fire-bombed, its windows smashed, and two members shot and wounded by a Nazi sympathizer. Because of declining numbers as some members moved away and others died, the congregation ceased operations in 2010.

==Law enforcement==
Gadsden is served by a 106-member municipal police department that includes a Patrol Division and Detective Division. The Patrol Division operates patrol, a bomb squad unit, a special projects team, and a joint SWAT team with the Etowah County Sheriff Office. The Detective Division serves a homicide or persons unit, property crime unit, financial crimes unit, and juvenile unit. In May 2010, the Gadsden Police Department acquired two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under the auspices of a $150,000 federal grant. The drones are equipped with video cameras and wireless transmitters, designed to be used for aerial surveillance.

==Education==
The Gadsden City Board of Education oversees fourteen schools: eight elementary schools, three middle schools, one high school, and two specialty schools (one alternative center and one technical center).

A new high school, Gadsden City High School, replaced the three former city high schools (Emma Sansom High School, Gadsden High School, and Litchfield High School) via merger for the 2006–2007 school year.

Gadsden is home to Gadsden State Community College, the second largest of the 27 two-year institutions in the Alabama Community College System. This was founded by former Governor George Wallace. Small satellites of Jacksonville State University and the University of Alabama also offer college courses in Gadsden.

Gadsden is home to the first statewide day-treatment program for juvenile offenders. The Community Intensive Treatment for Youth Program (C.I.T.Y.) was founded in January 1981 by Edward E. Earnest (1943-2005). With the assistance and support of the Honorable Judge Robert E. Lewis (1927-1993), the city of Gadsden, and the Gadsden City Board of Education, the C.I.T.Y. Program began enrolling students on February 1, 1981. C.I.T.Y. is designed to be a multi-dimensional program emphasizing habilitation (i.e., equipping at-risk youth on juvenile probation with skills needed to meet the demands of modern society).

Its objectives are to identify the at-risk youth&#x27;s individual strengths and weaknesses, provide an individualized environment in which the at-risk youth can develop skills, and alter the natural environment of the at-risk youth so that newly acquired skills are nurtured and encouraged. To achieve these objectives, C.I.T.Y. offers academic remediation in reading, math, language; intensive counseling that involves behavior modification, consumer education, and job readiness training. After all objectives have been met, C.I.T.Y. provides GED preparation, return to public school, and placement into technical school, college, job, or military service. In 1983, the C.I.T.Y. Program of Etowah County (Gadsden) received the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges Unique and Innovative Project Award. On October 1, 2009, C.I.T.Y.’s name was changed to Special Programming for Achievement Network (S.P.A.N.) It operates under the directorship of the Alabama Department of Youth Services. There are eleven SPAN programs in the state of Alabama.

<text>Hokes Bluff is a city in Etowah County, Alabama, United States. It is part of the Gadsden Metropolitan Statistical Area. At the 2020 census, its population was 4,446.

==History==
Hokes Bluff was established on a high bluff overlooking the Coosa River. The town was called &quot;The Bluff&quot;, and was used as a lookout station by Native American tribes, as they could see a great distance across, up and down the Coosa River. Hokes Bluff was one of the staging areas where the Cherokee were collected, and sent to Gunter&#x27;s Landing (Guntersville), and west to Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears.

Settlers came into the area in the 1840s. Daniel Hoke Jr. was among the settlers, who came in 1850 and built a trading post and a blacksmith shop near the site of the bluff. The town was renamed &quot;Hoke&#x27;s Bluff&quot; after him in 1853 by W.B. Wynne, a friend of Hoke. The town was raided and pillaged during the Civil War by raiding parties of both sides of the Union and the Confederacy. John Henry Wisdom, who became the &quot;Paul Revere of the Confederacy&quot; after making his famous ride from Gadsden to Rome during the Civil War, was a resident of Hokes Bluff.

A new mail route was established from Gadsden to Hokes Bluff in 1890. Before it was established, Hokes Bluff had poor mail service, receiving most mail by steamboat. The post office was established in 1877 and discontinued in 1931.

One legend associated with the town is about Tawannah Springs, the town&#x27;s water supply. It is said that the springs are named for a Native American princess (Tawannah) who grieved herself to death after her cousin, Princess Noccalula, jumped herself to death at Noccalula Falls in Gadsden.

Hokes Bluff was incorporated in 1946 with a population of 1,200. W.B. Ford was the first mayor. In 1949, a water system was installed with a 75,000 gallon reservoir and 54 hydrants. In 1953, gas was installed in the town, and in 1956, the streets were paved.
