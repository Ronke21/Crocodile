<text>Bhima (, ), also known as Bhimasena (, ), is a hero and one of the most prominent figures in the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, renowned for his incredible strength, fierce loyalty, and key role in the epic&#x27;s narrative. As the second of the five Pandava brothers, Bhima was born to Kunti—the wife of King Pandu—through the blessings of Vayu, the wind god, which bestowed upon him superhuman strength from birth. His rivalry with the Kauravas, especially Duryodhana, defined much of his life, with this tension ultimately erupting in the Kurukshetra War, where Bhima killed all hundred Kaurava brothers.

Bhima&#x27;s life was filled with extraordinary episodes that showcased his unmatched strength and bravery. From childhood, where he was rescued by the Nagas (divine serpents) after being poisoned, to his victories over formidable foes like Bakasura, Hidimba, and Jarasandha, Bhima&#x27;s adventures are integral to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;’s storyline. His raw, earthy nature is reflected in the brutal slaying of his enemies, his immense appetite and his marriage with Hidimbi, a rakshasi (a demoness), who bore him a son, Ghatotkacha, a powerful warrior who would later play a significant role in the Kurukshetra War.

Despite his immense physical strength, Bhima was deeply loyal and protective towards his family, particularly towards Draupadi, the common wife of the Pandavas. When Draupadi was humiliated in the Kaurava court, Bhima swore vengeance. He vowed to drink Dushasana&#x27;s blood and smash Duryodhana&#x27;s thigh, and years later, he fulfilled these vows during the Kurukshetra War. Bhima&#x27;s fierce devotion to Draupadi was also evident when he killed Kichaka, who had molested her during the Pandavas&#x27; year in disguise at the court of King Virata.

A master of mace combat, Bhima was considered one of the strongest warriors of his time, with his strength often compared to that of thousands of elephants. Yet, despite his brute force, Bhima also embodied a strong sense of justice and duty, which guided his actions throughout the epic. After the war, Bhima aided his brother Yudhishthira in ruling the kingdom and stood by his brother when he later renounced the throne. Bhima accompanied Yudhishthira and the other Pandavas on their final journey to the Himalayas, where he eventually succumbed to his flaw of gluttony. His character endures in Indian and Javanese cultures as a symbol of immense power, righteous anger, and unwavering loyalty.

==Etymology and epithets==
The word &quot;Bhīma&quot; in Sanskrit means &quot;terrifying,&quot; &quot;formidable,&quot; or &quot;fearsome,&quot; describing someone who inspires awe or fear through their sheer strength or power. In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Bhima is renowned for his vast size, immense physical strength and fierce nature. The suffix &quot;sena&quot; is often appended to his name, forming &quot;Bhīmasena&quot;, which can be literally interpreted as &quot;one who possesses a formidable army.&quot;.

==Literary background==
Bhima is a significant character in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, one of the Sanskrit epics from the Indian subcontinent. It mainly narrates the events and aftermath of the Kurukshetra War, a war of succession between two groups of princely cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas. The work is written in Classical Sanskrit and is a composite work of revisions, editing and interpolations over many centuries. The oldest parts in the surviving version of the text may date to near 400 BCE.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; manuscripts exist in numerous versions, wherein the specifics and details of major characters and episodes vary, often significantly. Except for the sections containing the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; which is remarkably consistent between the numerous manuscripts, the rest of the epic exists in many versions. The differences between the Northern and Southern recensions are particularly significant, with the Southern manuscripts more profuse and longer. Scholars have attempted to construct a critical edition, relying mostly on a study of the &quot;Bombay&quot; edition, the &quot;Poona&quot; edition, the &quot;Calcutta&quot; edition and the &quot;south Indian&quot; editions of the manuscripts. The most accepted version is one prepared by scholars led by Vishnu Sukthankar at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, preserved at Kyoto University, Cambridge University and various Indian universities.

Bhima also appears in few of the later written &quot;Puranic scriptures&quot;, most prominent being the Krishna-related &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;.

==Biography==
===Birth and early life===

Bhima was the second of the five Pandava brothers, the adoptive sons of retired Kuru king Pandu, and was born to Kunti with divine intervention due to Pandu&#x27;s inability to conceive. According to the epic, Kunti invoked the wind god, Vayu, using a mantra provided by the sage Durvasa, resulting in Bhima&#x27;s birth. This divine connection bestowed upon him immense physical strength. At the time of his birth, a celestine prophecy declared that he would become the mightiest warrior. A notable incident in his infancy underscored his extraordinary strength: when he accidentally fell from his mother&#x27;s lap onto a rock, the rock shattered into pieces while Bhima remained unscathed. This event served as an early indication of his formidable abilities.

After Pandu&#x27;s demise in the forest, the Pandavas were raised alongside their cousins, Kauravas, in Hastinapura, the capital of Kuru. During his childhood, Bhima&#x27;s strength was frequently displayed, often to the dismay of the Kauravas, particularly Duryodhana. Bhima&#x27;s physical prowess frequently led to his victories in their childhood games, resulting in animosity and jealousy among the Kauravas. This enmity culminated in a plot by Duryodhana, who conspired to eliminate Bhima. In one such plot, Bhima was given poisoned food and thrown into the Ganges River while unconscious. However, this plan inadvertently led to Bhima&#x27;s encounter with the Nagas (divine serpents) in their underwater realm.
As Bhima descended into the river&#x27;s depths, he reached the Naga realm, where the serpents bit him. Their venom neutralised the poison in his body, effectively reviving him. In this realm, Bhima met Aryaka, a Naga chieftain and his maternal relative. Recognising Bhima&#x27;s divine heritage, Aryaka introduced him to Vasuki, the king of the Nagas. Impressed by Bhima&#x27;s lineage and potential, Vasuki offered him a divine elixir. Bhima consumed eight pots of this elixir, thereby acquiring the strength of a thousand elephants. He spent eight days in the Naga realm to fully assimilate this power. On the ninth day, the Nagas, honouring his newfound strength, returned Bhima to Hastinapura, where he rejoined his family.

In Hastinapura, Bhima, along with his brothers, was trained in the arts of warfare under the tutelage of Dronacharya, the royal guru. Bhima specialised in the use of the mace (gada) and became an unmatched mace fighter. Additionally, he received advanced training from Balarama, known for his expertise in mace combat. Bhima&#x27;s training also included proficiency in various other weapons, establishing him as a versatile warrior.

Bhima was also renowned for his giant appetite – at times, half of the total food consumed by the Pandavas was eaten by him.

===Hiding and encounters with Rakshasas===

The rivalry between the Pandavas and the Kauravas intensified as they grew older. Bhima&#x27;s physical strength and assertiveness were sources of constant irritation for Duryodhana, who viewed him as a significant threat. The poisoning incident was one of several attempts by the Kauravas to eliminate Bhima. Another major scheme involved sending the Pandavas, along with Kunti, to Varanavata, where they were placed in a palace made of lac, known as Lakshagraha, with the intention of burning them alive. However, the Pandavas, forewarned by their uncle Vidura, managed to escape through a secret tunnel they had prepared, marking the beginning of their period of concealment to avoid further problems from the Kauravas.

After their escape from the burning Lakshagraha, the Pandavas, accompanied by their mother Kunti, traversed the forest to avoid further threats from the Kauravas. During their journey, Kunti and her sons, except Bhima, were overcome with fatigue. Demonstrating his exceptional strength, Bhima carried his mother and brothers on his shoulders through the forest. Their journey led them to the Kamyaka forest, inhabited by the Rakshasa (here, man-eating race) Hidimba and his sister Hidimbi.
While the Pandavas rested under a tree, Hidimba, who desired to consume them, dispatched his sister Hidimbi to lure them. However, upon encountering Bhima, Hidimbi was struck by his physical appearance and power, and she proposed marriage to him. When Hidimba discovered her intentions, he became enraged and attacked Bhima. Bhima engaged in combat with Hidimba and, after a fierce battle, killed him. Moved by Hidimbi&#x27;s plight, Kunti consented to Bhima&#x27;s marriage to her, on the condition that he would rejoin his family after some time. Bhima and Hidimbi had a son, Ghatotkacha, who later became a significant ally of the Pandavas.

Following this episode, the Pandavas proceeded to the village of Ekachakra, where they lived incognito. During their stay, Bhima encountered and killed the Rakshasa Bakasura who had been terrorising the villagers by eating them one by one.

===Marriages and children===
The Mahabhrata mentions three wives of Bhima-Hidimbi, Draupadi and Valandhara, with whom he had one son each. Bhima&#x27;s first wife, Hidimbi, also known as Hidimbā, was from the Rakshasa race—supernatural beings typically associated with evil deeds, such as consuming humans. Together, they had a son named Ghatotkacha (see previous section for details). Both Hidimbi and Ghatotkacha are notable exceptions, exhibiting benevolent qualities despite their Rakshasa origins.

Draupadi was the daughter of King Drupada of Panchala, who held a svayamvara, an ancient ceremony in which a princess could choose her husband from among assembled suitors. During their hiding, they heard of it and went to Panchala to attend it in disguise. During the svayamvara, numerous princes and warriors failed to fulfil the challenge set by King Drupada. However, Arjuna, disguised as a Brahmin, succeeded in the archery challenge, winning Draupadi&#x27;s hand. The Pandavas, who were in exile and disguised as Brahmins at the time, returned to their temporary abode with Draupadi. In a twist of events, Kunti, unaware of what Arjuna had won, instructed her sons to &quot;share the alms&quot; equally among them. Adhering to their mother&#x27;s words, the Pandavas agreed to marry Draupadi collectively. Thus, Draupadi became the wife of all five Pandavas, a union that was sanctified by divine mandate. Bhima, being one of her husbands, was known for his deep affection and protective nature toward Draupadi throughout their lives. From Draupadi, Bhima fathered Sutasoma.

Bhima&#x27;s other wife Valandhara, the daughter of King of Kashi, was won by him at her svayamvara contest. They had a son named Savarga. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; records Valandhara as Kali and Savarga as Sarvagata.

===Conquest for Rajasuya===

After their marriage to Draupadi, the Pandavas&#x27; survival was disclosed in Hastinapura. This was followed by the division of the kingdom, with Pandavas establishing a new city called Indraprastha. Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, aspired to perform the Rajasuya Yajna, a royal sacrifice that would establish him as an emperor. For this endeavour, he needed to assert his dominance over other kings and obtain their allegiance. Bhima played a crucial role in this military campaign. He was tasked with subjugating the kingdoms in the eastern region of the sub-continent, since Bhishma—the Grandsire of the Kuru princes— thought the easterners were skilled in fighting from the backs of elephants and in fighting with bare arms. He deemed Bhima to be the most ideal person to wage wars in that region. The Mahabharata mentions several kingdoms to the east of Indraprastha which were conquered by Bhima.

In his eastern campaign, Bhima, with the support of a mighty army, first moved diplomatically, beginning with the Panchalas, where he conciliated the tribe without conflict. From there, he swiftly vanquished the Gandakas, Videhas, and Dasarnas. In the Dasarna region, Bhima engaged in a notable battle with King Sudharman, who, after a fierce fight, was so impressed by Bhima&#x27;s prowess that he was appointed commander of Bhima&#x27;s forces. Bhima&#x27;s conquest continued as he defeated Rochamana, the king of Aswamedha, subjugating the entire eastern region. He then marched into Pulinda, bringing the kings Sukumara and Sumitra under his sway.

Bhima&#x27;s encounter with Shishupala, the king of Chedi, was peaceful, as Sisupala welcomed him and offered his kingdom. Bhima stayed for thirty nights before continuing his campaign, subjugating King Srenimat of Kumara and Vrihadvala, the king of Kosala, followed by the conquest of Ayodhya, where he defeated King Dirghayaghna. His victories extended to Northern Kosalas, Gopalakaksha, and the Mallas. As he approached the foothills of the Himalayas, he subjugated Bhallata and the Suktimanta mountains.

Bhima&#x27;s next set of conquests involved the kingdom of Kasi, where he vanquished King Suvahu, followed by the defeat of King Kratha of Suparsa. He continued to subdue regions like Matsya, Maladas, and Pasubhumi, before moving on to conquer Madahara, Mahidara, and the Somadheyas. His campaign in the north included the conquest of Vatsabhumi, Bhargas, Nishadas, and Manimat, along with Southern Mallas and the Bhagauanta mountains. Diplomatically, Bhima subdued the Sarmakas and Varmakas, while in Videha, he easily brought King Janaka under his control. He also conquered the Sakas and various barbarian tribes. His military prowess continued with the defeat of seven kings of the Kiratas near the Indra mountain, as well as the Submas and Prasuhmas. On his way to Magadha, he subdued the kings Danda and Dandadhara.

Jarasandha, ruler of the Magadha empire and an enemy of the Pandavas&#x27; main ally Krishna, posed a significant obstacle to Yudhishthira when the latter sought to perform the Rajasuya Yajna. As a formidable and powerful warrior, his elimination was deemed essential for the Pandavas&#x27; success. To address this challenge, Krishna, Bhima, and Arjuna, disguised as Brahmins, traveled to Magadha to confront Jarasandha. Upon meeting him, Jarasandha inquired about their true intentions, at which point the trio revealed their identities. Krishna then issued a challenge to Jarasandha for a duel, offering him the choice of any one opponent. Jarasandha selected Bhima, recognizing him as a worthy adversary in combat. Both Bhima and Jarasandha were renowned wrestlers, and their duel extended over several days, with neither willing to concede. Despite gaining the upper hand, Bhima found himself unable to kill Jarasandha. Seeking guidance, Bhima looked toward Krishna, who symbolically picked up a twig, split it into two halves, and threw the pieces in opposite directions. Bhima, interpreting this gesture, followed suit by bisecting Jarasandha&#x27;s body and scattering the halves apart, preventing them from reuniting. As a result, Jarasandha was killed. Jarasandha had previously imprisoned 100 kings, preparing them for sacrifice as part of his enmity with Krishna. His death at Bhima&#x27;s hands liberated these kings, who, in gratitude, pledged their allegiance to Yudhishthira, acknowledging him as the Chakravarti, or universal ruler.

Afterwards, Bhima then conquered Anga after defeating it king Karna. He later slew the mighty king of Madagiri. He further vanquished powerful rulers such as Vasudeva of Pundra, Mahaujah of Kausika-kachchha, and the king of Vanga. Additional conquests included Samudrasena, Chandrasena, and Tamralipta, as well as the kings of Karvatas and Suhmas. Finally, Bhima subdued the Mlechchha tribes along the sea coast and in marshy regions, gathering vast amounts of wealth from the Lohity region before returning to Indraprastha, where he offered the riches to Yudhishthira.

Yudhishthira was able to perform the Rajasuya Yajna successfully. During the grand ceremony, Bhima&#x27;s valor was acknowledged, and he played a prominent role in the various rituals and the protection of the sacrificial arena. However, the Rajasuya Yajna also sowed the seeds of future conflict. During the ceremony, a dispute arose regarding the distribution of royal honours. Bhima notably supported Krishna in the ensuing altercation with Shishupala, a vocal critic of Krishna and an antagonist to the Pandavas. Later, Duryodhana fell into a water pool, Bhima, along with the twins, laughed at him.

===Game of Dice and vows to slay the Kauravas===
The splendour of Yudhishthira&#x27;s Rajasuya Yajna and the prosperity of the Pandavas caused intense jealousy among the Kauravas, particularly Duryodhana. Seeking to usurp the Pandavas&#x27; power and wealth, Duryodhana, with the counsel of his maternal uncle Shakuni, invited Yudhishthira to a game of dice. Despite his misgivings, Yudhishthira accepted the challenge, driven by the codes of Kshatriya honour and hospitality. The game of dice was a turning point in the epic. Shakuni, who played on behalf of Duryodhana, used deceitful means to ensure Yudhishthira&#x27;s defeat. As the game progressed, Yudhishthira lost his kingdom, wealth, and even his brothers, including Bhima, one by one. Eventually, he wagered Draupadi and lost her as well.

The Kauravas&#x27; subsequent treatment of Draupadi, especially the attempt to disrobe her in the assembly hall, provoked Bhima&#x27;s fury. Bhima was the only one from the Pandavas&#x27; side to protest against the wrongdoing, with Vidura and Vikarna raising objections from the Kauravas&#x27; side. Unable to act due to his bondage through the game, Bhima became extremely upset with Yudhishthira and asked Sahadeva to bring fire so that he could &quot;burn Yudhishthira&#x27;s hands.&quot; When Arjuna pacified, Bhima responded by stating that when elders committed mistakes, verbally insulting them was equivalent to punishing them. Bhima also contemplated killing the Kauravas on the spot. However, Arjuna calmed him down, and Yudhisthira firmly prohibited any confrontation. 

After the Kauravas exiled the Pandavas for thirteen years, Bhima swore terrible oaths of vengeance. He vowed to kill Duryodhana by breaking his thigh, a reference to Duryodhana&#x27;s insulting gesture during the dice game, when he exposed his thigh (a euphemism for the genitals) and commanded Draupadi to sit on his lap. Bhima also swore to avenge Draupadi&#x27;s humiliation by drinking the blood of Dushasana, who had forcibly dragged her by her hair and attempted to disrobe her in the Kauravas&#x27; assembly.

===Exile and Life in the Forest===

During their twelve-year exile in the forest following their loss in the game of dice, the Pandavas encountered numerous adversities and engaged in various significant events. Bhima, with his immense strength and courage, was instrumental in addressing many challenges that arose during this period.

A prominent encounter during their exile was with the Rakshasa Kirmira, the brother of the Rakshasa Baka, whom Bhima had previously slain in Ekachakra. Kirmira, seeking revenge for his brother&#x27;s death, confronted the Pandavas in the Kamyaka forest. Bhima engaged in a fierce battle with Kirmira and ultimately killed him, thereby eliminating the threat he posed.

Another significant event involved the Pandavas&#x27; quest to obtain divine weapons. At one point, Arjuna departed to the Himalayas to undertake severe penance in order to acquire celestial weapons from the god Shiva. During Arjuna&#x27;s prolonged absence, Bhima and the remaining Pandavas grew increasingly concerned for his safety. The Pandavas ventured to Mount Gandhamadana in search of Arjuna. During this arduous journey, they encountered numerous challenges, including fatigue and harsh terrains. At one point, Draupadi fainted from exhaustion. Bhima then invoked his son Ghatotkacha, who promptly arrived and assisted the Pandavas. Ghatotkacha carried the Pandavas on his shoulders, allowing them to continue their journey with greater ease. Their journey eventually led them to the ashrama of Nara and Narayana. While resting there, Bhima noticed a fragrant Saugandhika flower, which had been carried to Draupadi by the northeast wind. Draupadi expressed her desire to possess more of these flowers. To fulfil her wish, Bhima set out in the northeast direction toward the Saugandhika forest. This journey brought Bhima to Kadalivana, where he encountered Hanuman, his half-brother, as both were sons of the wind god, Vayu. Initially, Hanuman tested Bhima&#x27;s strength and humility by blocking his path with his tail. Despite Bhima&#x27;s efforts, he was unable to move Hanuman&#x27;s tail. Recognising the limits of his strength, Bhima humbled himself, prompting Hanuman to reveal his true identity. Hanuman blessed Bhima and provided him guidance to the Saugandhika forest. Following this encounter, Bhima ventured into the forest, overcame the Rakshasas known as Krodhavasas guarding it, and successfully collected the flowers, which he later presented to Draupadi.

Another notable event during the Pandavas&#x27; exile involved the abduction attempt by Jayadratha, the king of Sindhu. While the Pandavas were away hunting, Jayadratha encountered Draupadi alone and abducted her. On learning of this, Bhima, along with his brothers, pursued and confronted Jayadratha. Bhima overpowered Jayadratha&#x27;s forces, captured him, and expressed a desire to kill him for his transgression. However, Yudhishthira intervened, advocating for a less violent resolution. Consequently, Bhima and his brothers humiliated Jayadratha by shaving his head, leaving him with a mark of disgrace before releasing him.

During their time in the forest, the Pandavas also encountered various sages and divine beings, from whom they received blessings and spiritual knowledge. These interactions not only provided them with guidance but also augmented their abilities to face future challenges. One significant episode was their encounter with Nahusha, a former king who had been transformed into a python due to a curse. Bhima, while traversing the forest, was captured by this python. Despite his strength, Bhima was unable to free himself. Yudhishthira arrived and, recognising the being as Nahusha, engaged in a dialogue with him. Through Yudhishthira&#x27;s wisdom, Nahusha was released from his curse and restored to his original form.

The Pandavas also had to contend with the ever-present threat of the Kauravas during their exile. On one occasion, the Kauravas, led by Duryodhana, encamped near the Pandavas&#x27; dwelling in Dvaitavana. During this encampment, Duryodhana and his forces clashed with the Gandharva Chitrasena. Duryodhana was captured by the Gandharvas, and upon hearing this, Bhima expressed amusement at his plight. However, at Yudhishthira&#x27;s behest, Bhima and the Pandavas intervened and freed Duryodhana from captivity. Although reluctant to assist their adversary, the Pandavas acted in accordance with their dharma, thereby upholding their principles.

In another minor incident in the epic, Jatasura, a rakshasa disguised as a Brahmin abducted Yudhishthira, Draupadi and the twin brothers, Nakula, and Sahadeva during their stay at Badarikashrama. His objective was to seize the weapons of the Pandavas. Bhima, who was gone hunting during the abduction, was deeply upset when he came to know of Jatasura&#x27;s evil act on his return. A fierce encounter followed between the two gigantic warriors, where Bhima emerged victorious by decapitating Jatasura and crushing his body.

===Incognito life in Virata&#x27;s kingdom===

After completing their twelve-year exile, the Pandavas entered their thirteenth year, during which they were required to live incognito. They sought refuge in the kingdom of Matsya, ruled by King Virata, and assumed various disguises. Bhima took on the role of Vallabha, a cook, and wrestler in King Virata&#x27;s palace. Within themselves, Pandavas called him Jayanta. His primary duties involved working in the royal kitchens, though his position as a wrestler occasionally necessitated the display of his physical prowess. There was a wrestling bout where a wrestler from a different state, Jimuta proved to be invincible. Much to the delight of King Virata and his subjects, Bhima challenged Jimuta and knocked him out in no time. This greatly enhanced the reputation of the Pandavas in unfamiliar territory.

A significant incident during this period was Bhima&#x27;s encounter with Kichaka, the brother-in-law of King Virata. Kichaka developed an infatuation with Draupadi, who was serving in the palace under the guise of a maid named Sairandhri. Kichaka&#x27;s advances toward Draupadi escalated and he tried to sexually assault her, prompting her to seek Bhima&#x27;s protection. Bhima devised a plan to eliminate Kichaka without revealing their true identities. He arranged for Draupadi to lure Kichaka into a secluded area, where Bhima, disguised, awaited him. A physical confrontation ensued, during which Bhima killed Kichaka. This incident was carried out discreetly to avoid compromising the Pandavas&#x27; incognito status. Kichaka&#x27;s brothers blamed Sairandhri (Draupadi) for his death and tried to forcefully cremate her along with Kichaka, but Bhima slew them and rescued Draupadi.

Despite Kichaka&#x27;s death raising suspicions within the palace, the Pandavas successfully maintained their disguises. Towards the end of their incognito year, the Kauravas and Trigartas raided the Matsya kingdom&#x27;s cattle in an attempt to expose the Pandavas. Bhima, along with his brothers, defended the kingdom, ensuring that their true identities remained hidden until the incognito period concluded.

===The Kurukshetra War===
Following the Pandavas&#x27; return from their exile, the Kauravas refused to restore their share of the kingdom. This refusal led to the inevitability of the Kurukshetra War. Bhima played a significant role in the events leading up to the war and was a key combatant throughout the eighteen days of conflict, which are documented in four books of the Mahabharata-Bhisma Parva, Drona Parva, Karna Parva and Shalya Parva.

Before the war commenced, discussions were held among the Pandavas and their allies regarding the strategy and leadership of the army. Bhima suggested that Shikhandi, who had the ability to challenge Bhishma due to Bhishma&#x27;s oath not to fight against a woman or someone perceived as a woman, should lead the Pandava forces. However, Yudhishthira and Arjuna decided to appoint Dhrishtadyumna as the commander-in-chief. Bhima&#x27;s chariot was driven by his charioteer, Vishoka, and bore a flag with a gigantic lion in silver, its eyes made of lapis lazuli. His chariot was yoked to horses described as being as black as bears or black antelopes. Bhima wielded a celestial bow named Vayavya, gifted to him by his divine father, Vayu, and also possessed the massive conch named Paundra. Additionally, he wielded a colossal mace, said to have the strength of a hundred thousand maces, which had been presented to him by Mayasura.

Before hostilities broke out, Krishna sought a final compromise to avoid war. During these peace talks, Bhima expressed his opinion that peace was preferable to war (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 74). However, he also asserted that he was prepared for battle and spoke confidently about his prowess in the upcoming conflict (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 76). When Duryodhana sent Uluka with a message to the Pandavas, Bhima responded with an insulting reply, rejecting any form of submission or negotiation (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 163).
====Bhishma Parva (1st - 11th days)====

On the first day of the Kurukshetra War, Bhima confronted Duryodhana in a direct duel. The clash between the two warriors set the stage for the fierce rivalry that would continue throughout the battle (Chapter 45, Verse 19). During this early phase, Bhima&#x27;s war cry was described as so powerful that it caused the world to shudder (Chapter 44, Verse 8).
Bhima then engaged in combat with the forces of the Kalingas. In this engagement, he killed the Kalinga prince Shakradeva (Chapter 54, Verse 24). Continuing his assault on the Kalinga army, Bhima also killed another key warrior, Bhanuman (Chapter 54, Verse 39). In the same battle, Bhima targeted the chariot of King Shrutayus, slaying warriors named Satyadeva and Shalya (distinct from another warrior also named Shalya), who were guarding the chariot wheels (Chapter 54, Verse 76). Following these encounters, Bhima proceeded to kill Ketuman (Chapter 54, Verse 77).
In addition to fighting individual warriors, Bhima turned his attention to the Kaurava elephant division. He decimated the division, causing a significant number of casualties and resulting in what was described as rivers of blood flowing on the battlefield (Chapter 54, Verse 103).

Later in the war, Bhima once again faced Duryodhana in combat. In this confrontation, he successfully defeated Duryodhana (Chapter 58, Verse 16). Bhima also engaged Bhishma, the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army, in combat on multiple occasions (Chapter 63, Verse 1). This battle was marked by intensity, with Bhima attempting to overpower Bhishma, though Bhishma remained undefeated.
Bhima then targeted the Kaurava brothers in a specific engagement, where he killed eight sons of Dhritarashtra. The names of those killed in this battle were Senapati, Jarasandha, Sushena, Ugra, Virabahu, Bhima, Bhimaratha, and Sulocana (Chapter 64, Verse 32). In another subsequent battle, Bhima fought against Bhishma once more (Chapter 72, Verse 21). He continued to engage Duryodhana, defeating him again in another encounter (Chapter 79, Verse 11).

In the course of the war, Bhima defeated Kritavarma (Chapter 82, Verse 60). Later, in his engagement with Bhishma, Bhima killed Bhishma&#x27;s charioteer (Chapter 88, Verse 12). Following this, Bhima killed eight more sons of Dhritarashtra in another fierce confrontation (Chapter 88, Verse 13). Bhima&#x27;s clashes also included a direct engagement with Dronacharya. In this battle, Bhima struck Dronacharya with such force that the preceptor fell unconscious (Chapter 94, Verse 18). Bhima continued his assault on the Kaurava brothers, killing nine more sons of Dhritarashtra (Chapter 96, Verse 23). In another encounter, Bhima faced Bahlika, whom he defeated in combat (Chapter 104, Verse 18). He also engaged Bhurishravas in a duel (Chapter 110, Verse 10). Bhima&#x27;s continued offensive efforts led to the killing of ten Maharathis (great chariot warriors) of the Kaurava army in a single battle (Chapter 113).

====Drona Parva (12th - 15th days)====

Dhritarashtra, the Kaurava patriarch, acknowledged Bhima&#x27;s prowess in the Drona Parva (Chapter 10). Bhima fought with Vivinsati in a combat engagement (Chapter 14, Verse 27). He then entered into a club fight with Shalya, defeating him (Chapter 15, Verse 8). Following this, Bhima fought with Durmarshana (Chapter 25, Verse 5). In this phase of the war, Bhima also killed Anga, the King of the Mleccha tribe (Chapter 26, Verse 17).

Bhima&#x27;s confrontation with Bhagadatta&#x27;s elephant was a notable encounter in which he was defeated and forced to retreat temporarily (Chapter 26, Verse 19). Later, he targeted Karna&#x27;s forces, attacking them and killing fifteen warriors in the process (Chapter 32, Verse 32). Bhima then fought against Vivinsati, Chitrasena, and Vikarṇa (Chapter 96, Verse 31).
In another engagement, Bhima fought Alambusha and emerged victorious (Chapter 106, Verse 16). Bhima then clashed with Kritavarma (Chapter 114, Verse 67). During a moment of distress, Bhima consoled Yudhishthira, who was facing a crisis of confidence (Chapter 126, Verse 32). Bhima confronted Drona again and was able to defeat him (Chapter 127, Verse 42). Following this battle, he killed a group of warriors, including Kundabhedi, Sushena, Dirghalochana, Vrindaraka, Abhaya, Raudrakarma, Durvimocana, Vinda, Anuvinda, Suvarma, and Sudarshana (Chapter 127, Verse 60). In a display of combat skill, Bhima threw Dronacharya off his chariot eight times (Chapter 128, Verse 18). Bhima engaged Karna in battle and succeeded in defeating him (Chapter 122). In a separate battle, Bhima killed Dussala, another warrior (Chapter 129). He later faced Karna once again (Chapter 131). In subsequent engagements, Bhima killed Durjaya (Chapter 133, Verse 13) and Durmukha (Chapter 134, Verse 20). He continued his campaign against the Kaurava brothers, killing Durmarshana, Dussaha, Durmada, Durdhara, and Jaya (Chapter 135, Verse 30).

Bhima fought Karna repeatedly, destroying many of his bows during their encounters (Chapter 139, Verse 19). In an aggressive maneuver, Bhima attempted to capture Karna by jumping into his chariot (Chapter 139, Verse 74). However, during this engagement, Karna struck Bhima with such force that Bhima fell unconscious (Chapter 139, Verse 91). Subsequently, Bhima killed the prince of Kalinga by thrashing and kicking him (Chapter 155, Verse 24). He continued his offensive against key warriors, pushing and beating Jayarata, Dhruva, Durmada, and Dushkarna to death (Chapter 155). Bhima also rendered the great hero Somadatta unconscious with his club (Chapter 157, Verse 10). Bhima encountered Vikarna along with seven Kaurava brothers . In the battle that ensued, Vikarna was killed. Bhima grieved Vikarna&#x27;s death by praising his noble deeds. In this chapter, Bhima also killed Bahlika (Chapter 157, Verse 11) and other warriors including Nagadatta, Dridharatha, Mahabahu, Ayobhuja, Dridha, Suhastha, Viraja, Pramathi, Ugra, and Anuyayi (Chapter 157, Verse 16).

On the 15th day of the war, Bhima attacked Duryodhana and defeated him after a fierce exchange. Bhima&#x27;s son Ghatotkacha was killed by Karna, leading to Bhima lament over his death. Bhima then killed the elephant named Ashvatthama as part of a strategic deception to spread the false news that Drona&#x27;s son, Ashvatthama, had been killed (Chapter 190, Verse 15). This ruse led to Drona&#x27;s surrender and eventual downfall. Bhima then fought against the Narayanastra, a celestial weapon deployed by Ashvatthama (Chapter 199, Verse 45). During this encounter, Bhima&#x27;s charioteer was killed (Chapter 199, Verse 45). Bhima was the only warrior who refused to submit to the invincible Narayanastra weapon and had to dragged to his safety by Arjuna and Krishna.

====Karna Parva (16th-17th days)====

In the Karna Parva, Bhima killed Kshemadhurti, the King of Kalata, in another battle (Chapter 12, Verse 25). He then fought Ashvatthama, but was struck down unconscious in this encounter (Chapter 15). Bhima killed Bhanusena, the son of Karna, in a subsequent duel (Chapter 48, Verse 27). He then killed Vivitsu, Vikata, Sama, Kratha, Nanda, and Upananda in another engagement (Chapter 51, Verse 12).

Bhima once again defeated Duryodhana in battle (Chapter 61, Verse 53). During this phase of the war, he took upon himself the responsibility of the battle&#x27;s outcome and directed Arjuna to guard Yudhishthira (Chapter 65, Verse 10). Bhima also defeated Shakuni in combat (Chapter 81, Verse 24). He engaged Duryodhana in another fierce encounter (Chapters 82 and 83).

In a critical moment of the war, Bhima killed Dushasana, fulfilling his vow and symbolically drinking the blood from Dushasana&#x27;s chest after ripping out his limbs and tearing his chest open. (Chapter 83, Verse 28). Following this, Bhima killed ten more sons of Dhritarashtra: Nisangi, Kavaci, Pasi, Dandadhara, Dhanurgraha, Alolupa, Sala, Sandha, Vatavega, and Suvarcas (Chapter 84, Verse 2).Bhima continued his assault on the Kaurava forces, killing 25,000 infantrymen single-handedly in one engagement (Chapter 93, Verse 28).

====Shalya Parva (18th day)====

In the Shalya Parva, Bhima defeated Kritavarma in combat (Chapter 11, Verse 45). He then fought Shalya in a club fight (Chapter 12, Verse 12). Bhima once again defeated Duryodhana (Chapter 16, Verse 42). In a subsequent battle, he killed the charioteer and horses of Shalya (Chapter 17, Verse 27).
Bhima then killed another 25,000 infantrymen (Chapter 19, Verse 49). He targeted the sons of Dhritarashtra, killing eleven more of them: Durmarshana, Shrutanta, Jaitra, Bhuribala, Ravi, Jayatsena, Sujata, Durvisha, Durvimocana, Duspradharsha, and Shrutavarma (Chapter 27, Verse 49).

In the climactic battle of the war, Bhima engaged Duryodhana in a mace duel. Duryodhana had gone and hid under a lake. The Pandavas brothers and Krishna thus went to the lake and taunted Duryodhana off his refuge. Yudhishthira proposed a final challenge to Duryodhana, to a battle against any of the Pandavas under any weapon of Duryodhana&#x27;s desire. Yudhishthira also promised Duryodhana that should he win, he would reign as the next King of Hastinapura. After given the option to choose the opponent, Duryodhana chose Bhima as his opponent.

Though Bhima had superior strength, Duryodhana had superior skills. Krishna reminded Arjuna about Bhima&#x27;s oath to smash Duryodhana&#x27;s thigh during the duel. Arjuna signaled to Bhima by slapping his thigh. Understanding that sign, Bhima threw his mace towards Duryodhana&#x27;s thigh while the latter was in mid-air during a jump. After defeating Duryodhana, Bhima taunted Duryodhana by kicking his head repeatedly and dancing madly. Enraged at this sight, Balarama grabbing his plough attempted to attack Bhima, but was stopped by Krishna. Krishna convinced his brother by reminding him of Bhima&#x27;s oath and the encroaching onset of the Kali Yuga.

===Later years and death===

After the Kurukshetra War, Bhima played a significant role in the events that followed. He pursued Ashvatthama, who had killed Draupadi&#x27;s sons (including Bhima&#x27;s son Sutasoma) in a night raid on the Pandava camp (Sauptika Parva, Chapter 13, Verse 16). After Ashwatthama was subdued and his powerful gem was taken from him, Bhima presented the gem to Draupadi (Sauptika Parva, Chapter 16, Verse 26), consoling her. Later, Bhima apologised to Gandhari, the mother of the Kauravas (Stri Parva, Chapter 15), and Dhritarashtra, who attempted to kill him by crushing him in a bear hug. Krishna intervened by replacing Bhima with a metal statue, and Dhritarashtra&#x27;s rage was appeased when he shattered the statue, allowing him to partially forgive him.

When Yudhishthira expressed a desire to renounce the world and take up the life of a sannyasin, Bhima urged Yudhishthira to remain on the throne (Shanti Parva, Chapter 19). Yudhishthira appointed Bhima as the commander-in-chief of Hastinapura. (Shanti Parva, Chapter 41, Verse 9) and settled him in the palace that had belonged to Duryodhana (Shanti Parva, Chapter 44, Verse 6). During the Ashvamedha Yajna conducted by Yudhishthira, Bhima took on the responsibility of measuring the sacrificial ground alongside the Brahmins (Ashvamedha Parva, Chapter 88, Verse 6). During this period, Babhruvahana, a son of Arjuna, visited Bhima, who sent him back with gifts of money and food grains (Ashvamedha Parva, Chapter 88, Verse 6). Bhima initially opposed Dhritarashtra&#x27;s request for funds to perform riyuals for those who had died in the war, but agreed after persuasions from Dhritarashta and Yudhishthira (Ashramavasika Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 7). After Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti retired to the forest, Bhima visited them once (Ashramavasika Parva, Chapter 23).

After almost three decades, upon the onset of the &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, the Pandavas delegated the administration of the kingdom to Parikshit, and embarked on their final journeyto the Himalayas. During the journey, Draupadi, Sahadeva, Nakula, and Arjuna each succumbed to death in succession. Bhima inquired about the cause of these deaths, and Yudhishthira provided him with appropriate explanations. When Bhima himself was on the verge of death, he questioned the reason, and Yudhishthira attributed it to Bhima&#x27;s gluttony. In some versions of the story, Yudhishthira points out Bhima&#x27;s boastfulness, gluttony, and battle-lust as the reasons for his fall. Bhima is seen among the Maruts and sitting next to his father Vayu, when Yudhisthira ascended to Svarga.

== Outside Indian subcontinent ==
=== Indonesia ===

Bhima, also known as Werkudara in Indonesian and Javanese culture, is a prominent figure in Indonesia&#x27;s wayang traditions, particularly within Javanese and Balinese cultures. Renowned for his strength, bravery, and wisdom, Bhima is portrayed as a figure who treats everyone equally, adhering to principles of honesty and loyalty. His character refrains from using refined speech or showing subservience, except in special circumstances, such as when he becomes a sage in the &quot;Bhima Suci&quot; play or during his meeting with Dewaruci.

In Indonesia, Bhima is highly skilled in the use of various weapons, including the mace (Gada) and other divine armaments like the Pancanaka and Rujakpala. He is also endowed with supernatural powers, including Aji Bandungbandawasa and Aji Ketuglindhu. Additionally, he is known for his symbolic attire, such as the Nagabanda belt and Cinde Udaraga pants, representing his divine stature.

Bhima&#x27;s presence in Indonesian mythology extends into the wayang puppet theater, where his stories are celebrated. He is depicted as the son of the wind god, Batara Bayu, and is known for his exceptional strength and ability to control the wind. Various tales recount his adventures, including his encounters with giants, his quest for divine knowledge, and his key role in the Mahabharata epic, particularly in the Baratayuda (the Javanese version of the Kurukshetra War).

Bhima&#x27;s image is also revered in Indonesia through various statues, such as those in Bali and at the National Museum of Indonesia. His cultural significance persists, making him a well-known figure among Javanese people, including the Javanese Muslims.

====Wayang story====

In the Javanese and Balinese wayang tradition, Bhima (also known as Werkudara) is a prominent and revered character, representing strength, courage, and an unwavering sense of righteousness. The wayang (shadow puppet theater) performances have transformed the story of Bhima into a narrative deeply infused with spiritual and moral themes, often differing from the classical Indian Mahabharata. In these performances, Bhima&#x27;s journey is not only physical but spiritual, as he seeks wisdom, power, and enlightenment.

One of the most well-known stories in wayang featuring Bhima is his encounter with Dewaruci, a powerful spiritual episode that symbolizes Bhima&#x27;s quest for inner knowledge. In this story, Bhima is tasked with finding the Tirta Amerta, the water of life, which symbolizes eternal truth. This leads him into the ocean, where he faces several trials. During this quest, Bhima meets Dewaruci, a miniature divine form of himself, who reveals the secrets of the universe to Bhima, teaching him the values of humility, inner strength, and the importance of enlightenment beyond physical might. The character of Bhima in wayang is also portrayed as a defender of the weak and a warrior who fights not only external battles but internal struggles as well. His devotion to his family, especially to his mother Kunti and brothers, is emphasized, highlighting his loyalty and dedication. His weapon of choice, the mace (gada), is a symbol of both his physical power and his ability to uphold justice.

The wayang performances often extend Bhima&#x27;s role beyond the original Indian epic, incorporating elements of local folklore, myth, and cultural values. As such, Bhima becomes a symbol of Javanese ideals—strength tempered by wisdom, loyalty to family and community, and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge. The wayang version of Bhima is deeply ingrained in Indonesian culture, serving as a moral guide and a heroic figure whose stories resonate with audiences across generations.

<text>Vayu (; ), also known as Vata () and Pavana (), is the Hindu god of the winds as well as the divine messenger of the gods. In the &quot;Vedic scriptures&quot;, Vayu is an important deity and is closely associated with Indra, the king of gods. He is mentioned to be born from the breath of Supreme Being Vishvapurusha and also the first one to drink Soma. The &quot;Upanishads&quot; praise him as &quot;Prana&quot; or &#x27;life breath of the world&#x27;. In the later Hindu scriptures, he is described as a dikpala (one of the guardians of the direction), who looks over the north-west direction. The Hindu epics describe him as the father of the god Hanuman and Bhima.
The followers of the 13th-century saint Madhva believe their guru as an incarnation of Vāyu. They worship the wind deity as Mukhyaprana () and consider him as the son of the god Vishnu.

==Connotations==
The word for air (&quot;vāyu&quot;) or wind (&quot;pavana&quot;) is one of the classical elements in Hinduism. The Sanskrit word &quot;Vāta&quot; literally means &#x27;blown&#x27;; &quot;Vāyu&quot;, &#x27;blower&#x27; and &quot;Prāna&quot;, &#x27;breathing&#x27; (viz. the breath of life, cf. the *&quot;an&quot;- in &quot;animate&quot;). Hence, the primary referent of the word is the &#x27;deity of life&#x27;, who is sometimes for clarity referred to as Mukhya-Vāyu (the chief Vayu) or Mukhya Prāna (the chief of life force or vital force).

Sometimes the word &quot;vāyu&quot;, which is more generally used in the sense of the physical air or wind, is used as a synonym for &quot;prāna&quot;. Vāta, an additional name for the deity Vayu, is the root of &quot;vātāvaranam&quot;, the Sanskrit and Hindi term for &#x27;atmosphere&#x27;.

==Hindu texts and philosophy==

In the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, Vayu is associated with the winds, with the Maruts being described as being born from Vayu&#x27;s belly. Vayu is also the first god to receive soma in the ritual, and then he and Indra share their first drink.

In the hymns, Vayu is &#x27;described as having &quot;exceptional beauty&quot; and moving noisily in his shining coach, driven by two or forty-nine or one-thousand white and purple horses. A white banner is his main attribute&#x27;. Like the other atmospheric deities, he is a &#x27;fighter and destroyer&#x27;, &#x27;powerful and heroic&#x27;.

In the Upanishads, there are numerous statements and illustrations of the greatness of Vayu. The &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; says that the gods who control bodily functions once engaged in a contest to determine who among them is the greatest. When a deity such as that of vision would leave a man&#x27;s body, that man would continue to live, albeit as a blind man and having regained the lost faculty once the errant deity returned to his post. One by one the deities all took their turns leaving the body, but the man continued to live on, though successively impaired in various ways. Finally, when Mukhya Prāna started to leave the body, all the other deities started to be inexorably pulled off their posts by force, &#x27;just as a powerful horse yanks off pegs in the ground to which he is bound&#x27;. This caused the other deities to realize that they can function only when empowered by Vayu, and can be overpowered by him easily. In another episode, Vayu is said to be the only deity not afflicted by demons of sin who were on the attack. This Vayu is &quot;Mukhya Prana Vayu&quot;. The Chandogya Upanishad says that one cannot know Brahman except by knowing Vayu as the &quot;udgitha&quot; (the mantric syllable &quot;om&quot;).

==Avatars==

American Indologist Philip Lutgendorf says, &quot;According to Madhva whenever Vishnu incarnates on earth, Mukhya Prana/Vayu accompanies him and aids his work of preserving dharma. Hanuman the friend and helper of Rama in the Treta Yuga, the strongman Bhima in Mahabharata, set at the end of Dvapara Yuga and Madhva in the Kali Yuga. Moreover, since the deity himself does not appear on earth until the end of kali age, the incarnate Vayu/Madhva serves during this period as the sole &#x27;means&#x27; to bring souls to salvation&quot;. Vayu is also known as Pavana and Matharishwa. 

In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Bhima was the spiritual son of Vayu and played a major role in the Kurukshetra War. He utilised his huge power and skill with the mace for supporting Dharma.

* The first avatar of Vayu is considered to be Hanuman. His stories are told in &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Since Hanuman is the spiritual son of Vayu he is also called Pavanaputra &#x27;son of Pavana&#x27; and Vāyuputra. Today, Pavan is a fairly common Hindu name.
* The second avatar of Vayu is Bhima, one of the Pandavas appearing in the epic the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.
* Madhvacharya, is considered as the third avatar of Vayu. Madhva declared himself as an avatar of Vayu and showed the verses in Rigveda as a proof. Author C. Ramakrishna Rao says, &quot;Madhva explained the Balitha Sukta in the Rigveda as referring to the three forms of Vayu&quot;.

== Buddhism ==
In East Asian Buddhism, Vayu is a &quot;dharmapāla&quot; and often classed as one of the () grouped together as directional guardians. He presides over the northwest direction.

In Japan, he is called Fūten (風天). He is included with the other eleven devas, which include Taishakuten (Śakra/Indra), Katen (Agni), (Yama), Rasetsuten (Nirṛti/Rākṣasa), Ishanaten (Īśāna), Bishamonten (Vaiśravaṇa/Kubera), Suiten (Varuṇa) Bonten (Brahmā), Jiten (Pṛthivī), Nitten (Sūrya/Āditya) and Gatten (Candra).

<doc id="100590" wikidata="Q855089" url="?curid=100590" title="Bhrigu">
<text>Bhrigu (, ) is a rishi of Adi-rishi tradition. He is one of the seven great sages, the Saptarshis, and one of the many Prajapatis (the facilitators of creation) created by Brahma. The first compiler of predictive astrology and also the author of &quot;Bhrigu Samhita&quot;, an astrological (jyotisha) classic. Bhrigu is considered a manasaputra (&quot;mind-born-son&quot;) of Brahma. The adjectival form of the name, &quot;Bhārgava&quot;, is used to refer to the descendants and the school of Bhṛgu. According to &quot;Manusmriti&quot;, Bhṛgu was a compatriot of and lived during the time of Svāyambhuva Manu, the progenitor of humanity. Along with Manu, Bhṛgu had made important contributions to the &quot;Manusmṛti&quot;, which was constituted out of a sermon to a congregation of saints in the state of Brahmavarta, after the great floods in this area. As per the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, Bhṛgu migrated to Bhrigukaccha, modern Bharuch, on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, leaving his son Chyavana at Dhosi Hill.

According to &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, he was married to Khyati, one of the nine daughters of Prajāpati Kardama. She was the mother of Lakshmi as Bhargavi. They also had two sons named Dhata and Vidhata. He had one more son with Kavyamata, who is better known than Bhrigu himself – Shukra, learned sage and guru of the asuras. The sage Chyavana is also said to be his son with Puloma, as is the folk hero Mrikanda. [Maha:1.5] One of his descendants was sage Jamadagni, who in turn was the father of sage Parashurama, considered an avatar of Vishnu.

==Legends==
Bhṛgu is mentioned in the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; and the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot;, where he is shown present during the great &quot;yajna&quot; of Daksha (his father-in-law). He supports the continuation of the Daksha yajna even after being warned that without an offering for Shiva, it was asking for a catastrophe for everyone present there. In the &quot;Tattiriya Upanishad&quot;, he is described to have had a conversation with his father Varuni on Brahman.

In the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, Krishna says that among sages, Bhrigu is the representative of the opulence of God.

=== Testing the Trimurti ===
The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; describes a legend in which sages gathered at the bank of the river Sarasvati to participate in a great &quot;yajna&quot;. The gathered sages could not decide who among the Trimurti (supreme trinity) of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva was pre-eminent and should be the recipient of the &quot;yajna&quot;. They deputed Bhrigu to determine this answer.

Upon being entrusted with the task, Bhṛgu decided to test each of the Trimurti. He first visited Brahma at Satyaloka, and to test his patience, he refused to sing in his praise or prostrate before him. Brahma grew angry, but realised that his son was testing him and allowed him to pass. Bhṛgu left for Kailasha, the abode of Shiva. Upon seeing the sage, Shiva rose to his feet and moved forward with great joy to embrace the sage. Bhṛgu, however, refused the embrace, and tested him by calling the deity a maligner of social conventions and rituals. Shiva was infuriated and prepared to strike the sage with his trident, but was calmed by his consort, Parvati. The sage then travelled to the abode of Vishnu, Vaikuntha. Vishnu was resting his head on the lap of Lakshmi when the sage arrived. Bhṛgu kicked Vishnu on the chest to wake him up, enraged by the perceived insult. Vishnu woke up, greeted Bhṛgu, and starts massaging his feet, regarding his chest to have been sanctified due to its contact with the sage&#x27;s foot. Overpowered with emotion, Bhṛgu went back to the sages and declared Vishnu to be the greatest among the Trimurti. 

According to some traditions, Vishnu&#x27;s consort Lakshmi grew angry at him because the chest was considered as Lakshmi&#x27;s place (&quot;vakshasthala&quot;) and left Vaikuntha to be born on earth. She was found on a lotus flower, and was raised by Bhrigu and his wife Khyati, which is why another name of Lakshmi is Bhargavi, daughter of Bhṛgu. Since she was found on a lotus, she is also called Padmavati. 

A variation of this is the legend behind Tirupati, in which a furious Lakshmi is born as Padmavati on earth and Vishnu assumes the form of Srinivasa and Venkateswara.

==Associated sites ==
Bhrigu is regarded to have had his ashram (hermitage) on the Vadhusar River, a tributary of the Drishadwati River near Dhosi Hill in the state of Brahmavarta, presently on the border of Haryana and the Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan in India. 

His son Chyavana, known for Chyavanprash also had his āśrama at Dhosi Hill. Bhṛgu is also worshipped at Bharuch, Swamimalai, Tirumala, Ballia, Nanguneri, Thiruneermalai, and Mannargudi.

An āśrama for Bhṛgu is in Maruderi, Chengalpattu district in Tamil Nadu. Khedbrahma in Gujarat is associated with Brahma and Bhṛgu&#x27;s legend of testing the Trimurti. Lastly, Bhṛgu migrated to Bhuinj Satara, Maharashtra where he took Samadhi. His āśrama and his daughter&#x27;s temple also situated there. His son&#x27;s āśrama and samadhi are also situated on Chyavaneshwar hill near Bhuinj.

== Literature ==
=== &quot;Upanishads&quot; ===
In Tattiriya Upanishad, first six anuvakas of Bhrigu Valli are called &quot;Bhargavi Varuni Vidya&quot;, which means &quot;the knowledge Bhrigu got from (his father) Varuni&quot;. It is in these anuvakas that sage Varuni advises Bhrigu with one of the oft-cited definition of Brahman, as &quot;that from which beings originate, through which they live, and in which they re-enter after death, explore that because that is Brahman&quot;. This thematic, all encompassing, eternal nature of reality and existence develops as the basis for Bhrigu&#x27;s emphasis on introspection and inwardization, to help peel off the outer husks of knowledge, in order to reach and realize the innermost kernel of spiritual self-knowledge.

=== &quot;Bhrigu Samhita&quot; ===
Bhrigu decided to write his famous books of astrology, the &quot;Bhrigu Samhita&quot;. Bhrigu collected birth charts, wrote full-life predictions, and compiled them together as &quot;Bhrigu Samhita&quot;. &quot;Bhrigu Samhita&quot; is believed to be one of the first book of its kind in the field of astrology.

== Lineage ==
The lineage of Bhrigu includes Shukra, Chyavana, Aurva, Richika, Jamadagni, Parashurama, Bhargava, Balai, and Dadhichi.

=== Shukra ===
Shukra, son of Bhṛgu, is considered to be a Daitya-Guru, teacher of the Asuras. Shukra learned the mṛtyu sañjivini vidya from Lord Shiva, with which he could revive the dead and grant them immortality. Additionally, Shukra is also known the planet Venus in astronomical terms.

=== Chyavana ===
Once, while Puloma was pregnant with Chyavana, Bhṛgu had gone for a bath. While he was gone, an asura who was also named Puloma came to Bhrigu&#x27;s āśrama in the form of a boar and kidnapped, or carried away, Bhṛgu&#x27;s wife. Because of this, Bhṛgu&#x27;s wife had a miscarriage. Despite being prematurely born, the infant was radiating light like the sun, which burned the asura into ashes. Later, when Puloma went back to Bhrigu with her prematurely-born yet miraculous child, Bhṛgu asked her how the asura had come to know of the location of the āśrama. She revealed that it was Agni who had told the asura Puloma about their whereabouts. Angered, Bhṛgu cursed Agni that he would consume all that came in his way.

=== Aurva ===
Aurva was the son of Chyavana and his wife Aarushi (daughter of Manu).

After King Krutavirya&#x27;s death, his sons invaded the Bhargava rishis&#x27; ashrams to get their wealth. Since the Kshatriyas were hunting them down, the rishis had to leave their ashrams. Among the fleers was Aarushi, who was pregnant at that time. In order to protect her unborn child, she hid her garbha (womb) in her thigh as she fled. The Kshatriyas, however, found out about this and caught her. As she was getting captured, her thigh broke and a child came out. The child was radiating immensely, and his light blinded the Kshatriya kings. The kings realized their mistakes and asked for forgiveness. The child, who was Aurva, returned their eyesight, however, his strong hatred towards the Kshatriyas remained even as he grew older. Aurva began to perform austerities to bring justice to his ancestors (pitrus) for how the Kshatriya kings had treated them, and the rigorousness of his austerities caused the world to start burning down. Frightened by the destruction caused by Aurva&#x27;s intense austerities, Aurva&#x27;s pitrus appeared before him, and pleaded him to withdraw the fire, force it into the ocean, and stop his austerities to prevent further damage.

<text>Naraka () is the realm of hell in Indian religions. According to schools of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, &quot;Naraka&quot; is a place of torment. The word &quot;Neraka&quot; (modification of &quot;Naraka&quot;) in Indonesian and Malaysian has also been used to describe the Islamic concept of Hell.

Alternatively, the &quot;hellish beings&quot; that are said to reside in this underworld are often referred to as &quot;Narakas&quot;. These beings are also termed in Sanskrit as &quot;Narakiyas&quot; (, ), &quot;Narakarnavas&quot; (, ) and &quot;Narakavasis&quot; (, ).

==Hinduism==

Naraka is a realm in the Vedas, a place where souls are sent for the expiation of their sins. It is mentioned primarily in the Dharmashastras, Itihasas, and the Puranas, but also described in the Vedic samhitas, the Aranyakas and the Upanishads. Some Upanishads speak of &#x27;darkness&#x27; instead of hell. A summary of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita mentions hell several times. Adi Sankara also mentions it in his commentary on the Vedanta sutra. With the exception of the views of one Hindu philosopher, Madhva, it is not seen as a place of eternal damnation within Hinduism. 

In Puranas like Bhagavata Purana, Garuda Purana, and Vishnu Purana, there are elaborate descriptions of many hells. They are situated above the Garbhodaka Ocean. The Vishnu Purana mentions the names of the various Narakas:

Yama, the god of death and justice, judges living beings after their death and assigns appropriate punishments. For instance, the murderer of a Brahman, the stealer of gold, or a drinker of wine goes to the hell termed as &quot;Shukara&quot;, meaning swine. According to some Vedanta schools of thought, Nitya-samsarins (forever transmigrating ones) can experience Naraka for expiation. After the period of punishment is complete, they are reborn on earth in human or bestial bodies. Therefore, Naraka is not an abode of everlasting punishment. 

&quot;Yama Loka&quot; is the abode of Yama. Yama is also referred to as the &quot;Dharmaraja,&quot; or the king of dharma; Yama Loka may be compared to a temporary &quot;purgatorium&quot; for sinners (papi). According to Hindu scriptures, Yama&#x27;s divine assistant, Chitragupta, maintains a record of the individual deeds of every living being in the world, and based on the complete audit of his deeds, dispatches the soul of the deceased either to Svarga (Heaven), or to the various Narakas, according to the nature of their sins. The scriptures describe that even people who have done a majority of good deeds could come to Yama Loka for redemption from the minor sins they have committed, and once the punishments have been served for those sins, they could be sent for rebirth to earth or to heaven.

At the time of death, sinful souls are vulnerable for capture by Yamaduttas, servants of Yama (who comes personally only in special cases). According to the Bhagavata Purana, Yama orders his servants to leave Vaishnavas alone. Sri Vaishnavas are taken by Vishnuduttas to Vaikuntha, and Gaudiya Vaishnavas to Goloka.

==Buddhism==

In Buddhism, Naraka refers to the worlds of greatest suffering. Buddhist texts describe a vast array of tortures and realms of torment in Naraka; an example is the &quot;Devadūta-sutta&quot; from the Pāli Canon. The descriptions vary from text to text and are not always consistent with each other. Though the term is often translated as &quot;hell&quot;, unlike the Abrahamic hells, Naraka is not eternal, though when a timescale is given, it is suggested to be extraordinarily long. There is not inherently any God required to be involved in determining a being&#x27;s entry and exit to and from the realm. Rather, the mind ends up here—as is the case with all the other realms in the Buddhist cosmology—by natural law: the law of karma, and they remain until the negative karma that brought them there has been used up.

==Jainism==

In Jainism, Naraka is the name given to realm of existence in Jain cosmology having great suffering. The length of a being&#x27;s stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long—measured in billions of years. A soul is born into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous karma (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result. After his karma is used up, he may be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened. Jain texts mention that these hells are situated in the seven grounds at the lower part of the universe. The seven grounds are:

# Ratna prabha
# Sharkara prabha
# Valuka prabha
# Panka prabha
# Dhuma prabha
# Tamaha prabha
# Mahatamaha prabha

<text>National Semiconductor Corporation was an American semiconductor manufacturer, which specialized in analog devices and subsystems, formerly headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company produced power management integrated circuits, display drivers, audio and operational amplifiers, communication interface products and data conversion solutions. National&#x27;s key markets included wireless handsets, displays and a variety of broad electronics markets, including medical, automotive, industrial and test and measurement applications.

On September 23, 2011, the company formally became part of Texas Instruments as the &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; division.

==History==

===Founding===
National Semiconductor was founded in Danbury, Connecticut, by Dr. Bernard J. Rothlein on May 27, 1959, when he and seven colleagues, Edward N. Clarke, Joseph J. Gruber, Milton Schneider, Robert L. Hopkins, Robert L. Koch, Richard R. Rau and Arthur V. Siefert, left their employment at the semiconductor division of Sperry Rand Corporation.

The founding of the new company was followed by Sperry Rand filing a lawsuit against National Semiconductor for patent infringement. By 1965, as it was reaching the courts, the preliminaries of the lawsuit had caused the stock value of National to be depressed. The depressed stock values allowed Peter J Sprague to invest heavily in the company with Sprague&#x27;s family funds. Sprague also relied on further financial backing from a pair of West Coast investment firms and a New York underwriter to take control as the chairman of National Semiconductor. At that time Sprague was 27 years old. Jeffrey S. Young characterized the era as the beginning of venture capitalism.

That same year National Semiconductor acquired Molectro. Molectro was founded in 1962 in Santa Clara, California, by J. Nall and D. Spittlehouse, who were formerly employed at Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation. The acquisition also brought to National Semiconductor two experts in linear semiconductor technologies, Robert Widlar and Dave Talbert, who were also formerly employed at Fairchild. The acquisition of Molectro provided National with the technology to launch itself in the fabrication and manufacture of monolithic integrated circuits.

In 1967, Sprague hired five top executives away from Fairchild, among whom were Charles E. Sporck and Pierre Lamond. At the time of Sporck&#x27;s hiring, Robert Noyce was de facto head of semiconductor operations at Fairchild and Sporck was his operations manager.

Sporck was appointed president and CEO of National. To make the deal better for Sporck&#x27;s hiring and appointment at half his former salary at Fairchild, Sporck was allotted a substantial share of National&#x27;s stock. Sporck took four of his personnel from Fairchild with him as well as three others from TI, Perkin-Elmer, and Hewlett-Packard to form a new eight-man team at National Semiconductor. Sporck had been Widlar&#x27;s superior at Fairchild before Widlar left Fairchild to join Molectro after a compensation dispute with Sporck.

In 1968, National shifted its headquarters from Danbury, Connecticut, to Santa Clara, California. However, like many companies, National retained its registration as a Delaware corporation, for legal and financial expediency.

Over the years National Semiconductor acquired several companies like Fairchild Semiconductor (1987), and Cyrix (1997). However, over time National Semiconductor spun off these acquisitions. Fairchild Semiconductor became a separate company again in 1997, and the Cyrix microprocessors division was sold to VIA Technologies of Taiwan in 1999.

From 1997 to 2002, National enjoyed a large amount of publicity and awards with the development of the Cyrix Media Center, Cyrix WebPad, WebPad Metro and National Origami PDA concept devices created by National&#x27;s Conceptual Products Group. Based largely on the success of the WebPad, National formed the Information Appliance Division (highly integrated processors &amp; &quot;internet gadgets&quot;) in 1998. The Information Appliance Division was sold to AMD in 2003.

Other businesses dealing in such products as digital wireless chipsets, image sensors, and PC I/O chipsets have also been recently closed down or sold off as National has reincarnated itself as a high-performance analog semiconductor company.

===The transformation of National Semiconductor===

Peter Sprague, Pierre Lamond and the affectionately called Charlie Sporck worked hand-in-hand, with support of the board of directors to transform the company into a multinational and world-class semiconductor concern. Immediately after becoming CEO, Sporck started a historic price war among semiconductor companies, which then trimmed the number of competitors in the field. Among the casualties to exit the semiconductor business were General Electric and Westinghouse.

Cost control, overhead reduction and a focus on profits implemented by Sporck was the key element to National surviving the price war and subsequently in 1981 becoming the first semiconductor company to reach the US$1 billion annual sales mark. However, the foundation that made National successful was its expertise in analog electronics, TTL (transistor–transistor logic) and MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) integrated circuit technologies. As they had while employed in Fairchild, Sporck and Lamond directed National Semiconductor towards the growing industrial and commercial markets and began to rely less on military and aerospace contracts. Those decisions coupled with inflationary growth in use of computers provided the market for the expansion of National. Meanwhile, sources of funds associated with Sprague coupled with creative structuring of cash flow buffering due to Sporck and Lamond provided the financing required for that expansion. Lamond and Sporck had also managed to attract and extract substantial funds to finance the expansion.

Among Sporck&#x27;s cost control efforts was his offshore outsourcing of labour. National Semiconductor was among the pioneers in the semiconductor industry to invest in facilities to perform final manufacturing operations of integrated circuits in developing countries, especially in Southeast Asia.

National Semiconductor&#x27;s manufacturing improvements under Sporck (in collaboration with Lamond) was enabled not by emphasizing process innovation but by improving and standardizing processes already established by other companies like Fairchild and Texas Instruments, as well as by frequent raiding to hire from Fairchild&#x27;s pool of talents.

===Weaknesses of Sporck&#x27;s leadership===
National Semiconductor under Sporck was not particularly invested in marketing strategies, even though it had the vision to launch itself into new and apparent opportunities in the consumer market. Sporck had applied strategies that made National Semiconductor function as a low-cost mass manufacturer of semiconductor commodities.

A few key executives and engineers left the company in 1981. Among them was Pierre Lamond, who had been the chief IC designer (now partner at Sequoia Capital). Robert Swanson&#x27;s departure in the same year to found Linear Technology was another indication of the appropriateness of organisational strategies of National Semiconductor under Sporck. &quot;For 13 of 14 years at National, I was a gung-ho guy. Then, the company started to get big. I kept looking at all the companies whose butts we&#x27;d been kicking. And then National started organizing itself like them. It was frustrating.&quot; Swanson said in the May 13, 1991, &quot;Business Journal-San Jose&quot;.

Sporck&#x27;s strategy of outsourcing sales to external sources meant National Semiconductor did not have sufficient or responsive resources to respond to requests from innovators, inventors and academic research—which would have been helpful in the technological innovation boom of the 1980s.

National Semiconductor&#x27;s lack and loss of innovation meant it was producing products that were easily copied and reproducible. It may have been the cheapest manufacturer in the United States, but it was not the cheapest compared to the Asian manufacturers. This weakness in National Semiconductor was evident in its failure to compete during the globalisation of Japanese semiconductor companies in the 1980s, followed by globalisation of Taiwanese and South Korean companies.

===Leadership under Gilbert F. Amelio===
On May 27, 1991, Charles E. Sporck was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO and president. Amelio was then president of Rockwell International&#x27;s semiconductor division and had a Ph.D. in physics from Georgia Institute of Technology. Amelio had also been formerly employed at Fairchild.

Amelio was faced with a company plagued with over-capacity and shrinking market share. Amelio found that, just prior to his taking helm, despite having spent US$1 billion over the last five years on research and development, National Semiconductor had a disappointing record in new products. The Business section of &quot;The New York Times&quot; January 11, 1991, reflected the over-capacity generated by Sporck that had to be inherited by Amelio.

Amelio disposed of the non-core products and assets in which National Semiconductor had no market motivation or expertise and turned the company towards its core expertiseanalog semiconductors. National Semiconductor under Amelio emphasized on reduction of cost of sales, improving capacity utilization, scrap reduction and cycle-time reduction. Redundant facilities were sold and consolidated.

With the progress of restructuring, National Semiconductor increased revenues each year. In 1994, National Semiconductor under Amelio posted record net revenues of US$2.29 billion. It was also a time when US semiconductor companies had regained market leadership. Amelio introduced benchmarking to evaluate productivity, restructured marketing strategies and reorganised management by introducing modern management practices and workplace environments.

Amelio divided products into two divisions: Standard Products Group which comprised low-margin, logic and memory chipscommodity products which were more susceptible to cyclical demands and through which National Semiconductor had matured; and Communications &amp; Computing Group which comprised high-margin, value-added analog and mixed-signal chips. Amelio&#x27;s division of products seemed to prepare National Semiconductor for the eventual disposal of low-margin commodity products, which came to fruition later with the sale of a reconstituted Fairchild.

National Semiconductor under Amelio chose to build a brand new eight-inch (200 mm) wafer fabrication plant in South Portland, Maine. It chose to divest itself of its then somewhat new plant in Migdal HaEmek, Israel, which became Tower Semiconductor.

In 1995, Amelio was elected as the chairman of the board of directors of National Semiconductor.

In 1996, Amelio accepted an invitation from Apple Computer, a customer of National Semiconductor, to join its board of directors. Troubles at Apple later prompted the board to invite Amelio to take on the position of CEO, which he accepted in February 1996. National Semiconductor announced the resignation of Amelio as the company&#x27;s president, chairman and chief executive officer on February 2, 1996.

===Leadership under Brian L. Halla===
National Semiconductor announced the appointment of Brian L. Halla as its chairman, president and CEO on May 3, 1996. Halla was then the head of LSI logic products division. Prior to LSI, he had been with Intel for 14 years.

Halla reinforced Amelio&#x27;s emphasis on the expertise of National Semiconductor in analog technology. He also was, on occasions, an evangelist for analog technology. However, he found that National Semiconductor under Amelio had too few product offerings. Halla embarked on a diversification into personal computer and graphics business.

He advocated PC-on-a-chip (aka system-on-a-chip) as a business direction for National Semiconductor. During his tenure at LSI, LSI had successfully applied similar concepts. However, LSI had steered clear of getting involved with PC technologies that would make it a competitor with Intel. Halla held the vision that information appliances (IAs) would succeed the personal computer as a trend. He predicted that IAs would overtake sales of PCs by the year 2000.

To achieve the goal, National Semiconductor started acquiring companies that would provide the needed technological complements. Among the acquisitions were Cirrus Logic Inc&#x27;s PicoPower business, for its specialised expertise in small form factor devices; Mediamatics Inc, which makes multimedia connectivity products; Future Integrated Systems Inc, a PC graphics company; Gulbransen Inc, a digital audio technology maker; ComCore Semiconductor Inc, a maker of digital signal processing for LANs; Cyrix, the maker of Intel x86 clones.

On March 11, 1997, National Semiconductor Corporation announced the US$550 million sale of a reconstituted Fairchild to the management of Fairchild with the backing of Sterling LLC, a unit of Citicorp Venture Capital. Fairchild carried with it what was mostly the Standard Products group previously segregated by Amelio. Incidentally, the effective price of acquisition of Cyrix was also US$550 million.

On November 17, 1997, National Semiconductor and Cyrix announced the merger of the companies. Cyrix would become an autonomous wholly owned subsidiary. Halla had earlier emphasized that National was after the low-end CPU market as part of the system-on-a-chip pursuit and therefore would not place emphasis on Cyrix&#x27;s current development of high-end 6x86MX design. However, Cyrix later announced that its merger with National Semiconductor would not change its development or marketing plans.

The acquisition of an independent-minded Cyrix subsequently turned National Semiconductor from a collaborator into a competitor with Intel. National lost its business with Intel. Intel reinstated the relationship after the sale of Cyrix.

The acquisition of Cyrix also carried with it a business obligation to use the IBM Microelectronics Division to fabricate the Cyrix chips, as well as technical constraint to do the same, while National Semiconductor had plans to transfer their fabrication to its South Portland fab. National incurred huge losses in its processor business and announced the sale of Cyrix to VIA in 1999.

In 1999, National Semiconductor also put out feelers for selling if not the whole, then a majority stake of, its fabrication plant in South Portland, Maine. However, that did not come to fruition.

On June 28, 2000, National Semiconductor and TSMC Taiwan signed an agreement that would allow transfer of advanced fabrication technologies from TSMC to the National Semiconductor fabrication plant in South Portland, Maine.

On March 11, 2009, National announced plans to close its assembly and test plant in Suzhou, China, and its wafer fabrication plant in Arlington, Texas.

On October 9, 2009, Brian Halla announced his retirement as National&#x27;s CEO. He remains executive chairman. The company promoted Donald (Don) Macleod, who had previously served as the company&#x27;s president and chief operating officer, to CEO.

===Leadership under Donald Macleod===
Don Macleod became National Semiconductor&#x27;s chief executive officer on November 30, 2009. He was named chairman of the board on May 31, 2010.

===Acquisition by Texas Instruments===

On April 4, 2011, Texas Instruments announced that it had agreed to buy National Semiconductor for $6.5 billion in cash. Texas Instruments paid $25 per share of National Semiconductor stock, an 80% premium over the April 4, 2011, closing share price of $14.07. The deal made Texas Instruments one of the world&#x27;s largest makers of analog technology components. On September 19, 2011, the Chinese minister approved the merger, the last one needed. The companies formally merged on September 23, 2011.

==Manufacturing locations==
National Semiconductor also had operations in Migdal (tower) Ha&#x27;Emeq (valley), Israel. National Semiconductor had six inch (152 mm) wafer fabrication operations there. In 1993, National Semiconductor divested to retain 19% ownership of the plant. The plant in Migdal Ha&#x27;Emeq, Israel is now constituted as Tower Semiconductor of Israel.

<text>Bhutamata () is a frighful form of the Hindu goddess Parvati, sometimes also regarded to be the shakti (divine feminine energy) of the deity Kartikeya. 

== Legend ==
In the Skanda Purana, the deity Kartikeya allowed the bhutas (ghosts), pishachas, and vetalas along the banks of the river Sarasvati to consume Vedic ritual offerings that were performed incorrectly. However, these beings eventually started to consume all the offerings made to the devas, who complained to Kartikeya. Out of the deity&#x27;s fury, a twelve-eyed goddess emerged from between his eyebrows and sought to serve him. Kartikeya commanded her to bring the disobedient creatures to submission and restore them to right conduct. Accompanied by a host of numerous goddesses, the goddess attacked the creatures, who quickly propitiated her. Pleased, the goddess offered a boon to the creatures. They requested that she be &quot;Bhutamata&quot; (the mother of the bhutas) and promised to never transgress the laws of Kartikeya.

<text>Brahmani (Sanskrit: ब्रह्माणी, IAST: Brahmāṇī) or Brahmi (Sanskrit: ब्राह्मी, IAST: Brāhmī), is one of the seven Hindu mother goddesses known as Sapta Matrikas. She is a form of Saraswati and is considered as the Shakti of the creator god Brahma in Hinduism. She is an aspect of Adi Shakti, possessing the &quot;Rajas Guna&quot; and is therefore the source of Brahma&#x27;s power.

==Legends==

When Brahma was in meditation for the creation of the universe, his body was divided into two parts. They then formed the gods and goddesses, whereby one part was male and the other one female. Thus female parts became Gayatri, Savitri, Saraswati, and others.

== Iconography ==

The goddess is depicted yellow in colour with four heads and four(or six) arms. Like Brahma, she holds a japamala, a kamandalu (water pot), a lotus stalk, bells, vedas and the trident while she is seated on a hamsa (identified with a swan or goose) as her vahana (mount or vehicle). Sometimes, she is shown seated on a lotus with a swan on her banner. She wears various ornaments and is distinguished by her basket-shaped crown called &quot;&quot;.

==Kuldevi==
She is the Kuldevi Prajapati samaj, Gurjar Kshatriya Kadiya , Golvadiyas(subcast of leuva Patels), nagar brahmins, darji samaj and other communities of Rajasthan and Kutch, including Rajputs and the KGK Community.

==Brahmani temples in India==

<text>Brahmaloka (Sanskrit: ब्रह्मालोक, IAST: Brahmāloka) or Satyaloka (Sanskrit: सत्यलोक) sometimes refers to the realm of Brahma, the creator god, a member of the Trimurti along with Vishnu and Shiva, along with his consort Saraswati. It is also referred to as Brahmapura, in the Puranas. Brahmaloka also refers to the abode of Brahman.

Brahmaloka is described to be 60,000,000 miles above the Prajapati loka and is considered to be of great soteriological significance. It is a sphere where the inhabitants never again know death, dwelling perpetually in the company of yogins, and drinking the excellent nectar of yoga.

== Location ==
In the center of Brahmaloka is Brahmapura, a huge palace where Brahma resides.

== Description ==
Brahmaloka is a realm composed entirely of Brahman, considered superior to the Svarga loka and full of immortal energy, knowledge and bliss. It is also known as the planet of the Bhagavān.

The above statement shows that Brahmaloka is an eternal Vaikuntha that is neither created nor located within the material realm and is a home for the Supreme Soul.

The Chandogya Upanishad says in 8:1

In Chandogya Upanishad 8.4.3, Brahmaloka is mentioned as a realm that one achieves by living a life of &quot;brahmacarya&quot;:
==Buddhism==

In Buddhism, Brahmaloka refers to the highest celestial worlds in existence, the abode of the Brahmas. It consists of twenty heavens, namely:

* the three ordinary Brahma-worlds
* the three Śubhakṛtsna worlds
* the three Ābhāsvara worlds
* the two Bṛhatphala worlds
* the five Suddhāvāsā worlds,
* the four Arūpa worlds,

All except the four Arūpa worlds are classed among the Rūpa worlds (the inhabitants of which are corporeal). The inhabitants of the Brahmaloka are free from sensual desires. Brahmaloka consists only of higher devas or higher celestial beings called Brahmas and rebirth in the Brahma world is the result of great virtue due to meditation. The Jataka tales also contain various instances of ascetics who practiced meditation, being reborn after death in Brahmaloka. Furthermore, it is believed that while the rest of the world will be destroyed at the end of a Maha-Kalpa, the Brahmaloka will survive and that the first beings to be born on Earth will come from the ābhassara Brahma world. The Brahmās here are represented as visiting earth and taking an interest in the affairs of men. This is why Nārada descends from the Brahmaloka to dispel the heresies of King Angati in the Lord Brahma-Nārada tale in the Mahanipata Jataka.

===Brahmaloka in Theravada Buddhism===

Arupa worlds are the highest among all divine worlds Brahma worlds. Since the beings born in these Brahman worlds with very long lifespans are formless worlds, many Buddhas were born and preached the Dhamma, even if the beings are filled to the point of Ama Maha Nirvana, they do not get to hear the Dhamma. During the time when our great Bodhisattva was performing difficult tasks, Alara Kalama and Uddakaraputta, who were teachers, were born in these worlds after giving birth to Dhyana, so they did not get nirvana in this Buddha seat.

Those who have acquired formative meditation will be born in the formless Brahman worlds after death, and those who have attained higher formless meditation will be born in the formless Brahman worlds after death. For that, the Dhyanas acquired must die without deterioration. But worldly meditation taken as Ashtasamapatti can deteriorate. Therefore, those dhyanas acquired by meditating with vigor should be preserved without deterioration.

The kirya mind was born in connection with the rupavachara and arupavachara meditations associated with Buddhas and Arhats. These rupavachara, arupavachara meditation minds are also called Mahaggata minds in Abhidhamma. Meritorious minds, meritorious minds and meritorious minds are considered for those who are not rahats. Arhats will have milky hearts. There is no power of reciprocation in the mind. In this way, like the emotional mind, the Pratishandhi mind is also a Vipaka mind. That is, what is the purpose of the mind is also the purpose of the Pratishandhi mind. And among the above-mentioned Brahma worlds, there is also a Bambalo, where the fourth Dhyana Vaduvas are born as Asanjasanta. Sages, yogis who have grown into intense meditation, are born here and have only a physical body. There is no mind. Yogis take the mind out of the body by gradually focusing the mind on one goal at the same time as the fourth meditation. For this one must have strong mental concentration. This world of Brahma is born from animals in the same posture as when it was born from the world of man. Chaturtha Dhyanaddo should resolve to be born in this world of Brahman. Even though this is a metaphorical world, it should be abandoned when the specified life span is over. The reason for this is that the impermanence that affects other worlds is common to this world of Brahma. Also, when born in the worlds of Brahma, such as Suddhavasa, the lifespan is very long, so a noble person who has all the paramitas can listen to the teachings of a Buddha and see nirvana in the worlds of Brahma.

The Buddha says so because during the lifetime of the Brahman worlds, a large number of Buddhas appear in the world. All the Buddhas who appear in this way go to the world of snakes to preach the Dhamma.

And the nature and composition of the worlds of Brahma are as follows. That is the people of the great Brahma reside in the Brahma Parisajja. In the Brahma Purohita resides the advisors of the great Brahma The Great Brahman is the world where the Great Brahman resides. Phrathabhaya is a world of Brahman with dim light. The light of appamanabha spreads immeasurably. In Abhassara resides the Brahmas whose body light is very vast. In Paritta Subha dwells the Brahmans who spread their light in a little way. Brahman, who spreads the immeasurable light of the infinite bliss, closes. Brahmas who radiate unchanging bodily light in Subha Kinha reside. The Brahmins who have attained Mahatphala Mahanisamsa in Vehappala are closed. The Dhamma also mentions the above-mentioned body light as Khyama Prabhava.

According to Buddhism, the number of Brahma worlds Twenty is more than the number of divine worlds. According to the teaching of Buddhism, the details about Brahma Loka are given below.

<text>The 1st Dalai Lama, Gedun Drupa (; 1391–1474) was a student of Je Tsongkhapa, and became his first Khenpo (Abbott) at Ganden Monastery. He also founded Tashi Lhunpo Monastery in Shigaste. He was posthumously awarded the spiritual title of Dalai Lama.

== Biography ==
Gedun Drupa was born in a cow-shed in Gyurmey Rupa near Sakya in the Tsang region of central Tibet, the son of Gonpo Dorjee and Jomo Namkha Kyi, nomadic tribespeople. He was raised as a shepherd until the age of seven. His birth name (according to the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center, his personal name) was Péma Dorjee (, &quot;Vajra Lotus&quot;).

=== Ordination ===
Later he was placed in Narthang Monastery. In 1405, he took his &quot;getsul&quot; (novitiate) vows from the abbot of Narthang, Khenchen Drupa Sherap. When he was 20 years old, in about 1411 received the name Gedun Drupa upon taking the vows of a &quot;bhikṣu&quot; (monk) from the abbot of Narthang Monastery. Also at this age he became a student of the scholar and reformer Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), who some say was his uncle. Around this time he also became the first abbot of Ganden Monastery, founded by Tsongkhapa himself in 1409.

=== Career ===
By the middle of his life, Gedun Drupa had become one of the most esteemed scholar-saints in the country. Gedun Drupa founded the major monastery of Tashi Lhunpo Monastery at Shigatse, which later became the seat of the Panchen Lamas.

Gedun Drupa did not hold national political power. It was in the hands of viceroys such as the Sakyas, the prince of Tsang, and the Mongolian Khagan. The Tibetan national political leadership positions of the successive Dalai Lamas began much later during the reign of the 5th Dalai Lama, in 1642.

He remained the Khenpo of Tashi Lhunpo Monastery until he died while meditating in 1474 at the age of 84 (83 by Western reckoning).

== Legends ==
Tradition states that Palden Lhamo, the female guardian spirit of the sacred lake, Lhamo La-tso, promised the First Dalai Lama in one of her visions &quot;...that she would protect the reincarnation lineage of the Dalai Lamas.&quot; Since the time of Gedun Gyatso, who formalized the system, monks have gone to the lake to meditate when seeking visions with guidance on finding the next reincarnation.

== Notable contemporaries ==
The Samding Dorje Phagmo (1422–1455), the highest female incarnation in Tibet, was a contemporary of Gedun Drupa. Her teacher, the Bodongpa Panchen Chogley Namgyal was also one of his teachers; he received many teachings and empowerments from him.

==Works==
Some of the most famous texts Gedun Drupa wrote were:
* &quot;Sunlight on the Path to Freedom&quot;, a commentary on Abhidharma-kosa
* &quot;Crushing the Forces of Evil to Dust&quot;, an epic poem on the life and liberating deeds of Gautama Buddha
* &quot;Song of the Eastern Snow Mountain&quot;, a poem dedicated to Je Tsongkhapa
* &quot;Praise of the Venerable Lady Khadiravani Tara&quot;, an homage to Tara

<text>Buddhi (Sanskrit: बुद्धि) refers to the intellectual faculty and the power to &quot;form and retain concepts, reason, discern, judge, comprehend, understand&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Buddhi&quot; () is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit root &quot;Budh&quot; (बुध् ), which literally means &quot;to wake, be awake, observe, heed, attend, learn, become aware of, to know, be conscious again&quot;. The term appears extensively in Rigveda and other Vedic literature. &quot;Buddhi&quot; means, states Monier Williams, the power to &quot;form, retain concepts; intelligence, reason, intellect, mind&quot;, the intellectual faculty and the ability to &quot;discern, judge, comprehend, understand&quot; something.

Buddhi is a feminine Sanskrit noun derived from &quot;*budh&quot;, to be awake, to understand, to know. The same root is the basis for the more familiar masculine form &quot;Buddha&quot; and the abstract noun &quot;bodhi&quot;.

Buddhi contrasts from &quot;manas&quot; (मनस्) which means &quot;mind&quot;, and &quot;ahamkara&quot; (अहंंकाऱ) which means &quot;ego, I-sense in egotism&quot;.

==Usage==
In Sankhya and yogic philosophy both the mind and the ego are forms in the realm of nature (&quot;prakriti&quot;) that have emerged into materiality as a function of the three &quot;gunas&quot; (गुण) through a misapprehension of &quot;purusha&quot; (पुरूष) (the consciousness-essence of the &quot;jivatman&quot;). Discriminative in nature (बुद्धि निश्चयात्मिका चित्त-वृत्ति), &quot;buddhi&quot; is that which is able to discern truth (&quot;satya&quot;) from falsehood and thereby to make wisdom possible.

== The Sānkhya-Yoga view ==
According to the Sānkhya-Yoga view, &quot;buddhi&quot; is in essence unconscious, and as such, cannot be an object of its own consciousness. This means that it can neither apprehend an object nor manifest itself.

In the Yoga Sutra, it is explained that the &quot;buddhi&quot; cannot illuminate itself, since it itself is the object of sight, &quot;na tat svhāsam draśhyatvāt&quot;.

<text>The San Remo conference was an international meeting of the post-World War I Allied Supreme Council as an outgrowth of the Paris Peace Conference, held at Castle Devachan in Sanremo, Italy, from 19 to 26 April 1920. The San Remo Resolution passed on 25 April 1920 determined the allocation of Class &quot;A&quot; League of Nations mandates for the administration of three then-undefined Ottoman territories in the Middle East: &quot;Palestine&quot;, &quot;Syria&quot; and &quot;Mesopotamia&quot;. The boundaries of the three territories were &quot;to be determined [at a later date] by the Principal Allied Powers&quot;, leaving the status of outlying areas such as Zor and Transjordan unclear.

The conference was attended by the four Principal Allied Powers of World War I who were represented by the prime ministers of Britain (David Lloyd George), France (Alexandre Millerand), Italy (Francesco Nitti) and by Japan&#x27;s Ambassador Keishirō Matsui.

==Prior events==
It was convened following the February Conference of London where the allies met to discuss the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire and the negotiation of agreements that would become the Treaty of Sèvres.

On 30 September 1918 supporters of the Arab Revolt in Damascus had declared a government loyal to Sharif Hussein, who had been declared &quot;King of the Arabs&quot; by religious leaders and other notables in Mecca. During the meetings of the Council of Four in 1919, British Prime Minister Lloyd George stated that the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence was the basis for the Sykes–Picot Agreement, which proposed an independent Arab state or confederation of states. In July 1919 the parliament of Greater Syria had refused to acknowledge any right claimed by the French Government to any part of Syrian territory.

On 6 January 1920 Hussein&#x27;s son Prince Faisal initialled an agreement with French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau which acknowledged &quot;the right of the Syrians to unite to govern themselves as an independent nation&quot;. A Pan-Syrian Congress, meeting in Damascus, had proclaimed an independent Arab Kingdom of Syria on 8 March 1920. The new state included modern Syria and Jordan, portions of northern Mesopotamia which had been set aside under the Sykes–Picot Agreement for an independent Arab state or confederation of states, and nominally the areas of modern Israel–Palestine and Lebanon, although the latter areas were never under Faisal&#x27;s control. Faisal was declared the head of state. At the same time Prince Zeid, Faisal&#x27;s brother, was declared regent of Mesopotamia.

==Issues addressed==
The peace treaty with Turkey, the granting of League of Nation mandates in the Middle East, Germany&#x27;s obligations under the Versailles Peace Treaty of 1919, and the Allies&#x27; position on Soviet Russia.

==Agreements reached==
Asserting that not all parts of the Middle East were ready for full independence, mandates were established for the government of three territories: Syria, Mesopotamia and Palestine. In each case, one of the Allied Powers was assigned to implement the mandate until the territories in question could &quot;stand alone.&quot; Great Britain and France agreed to recognize the provisional independence of Syria and Mesopotamia, while claiming mandates for their administration. Palestine was included within the Ottoman administrative districts of the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem together with the Sanjak of Nablus and Sanjak of Akka (Acre).

The decisions of the San Remo conference confirmed the mandate allocations of the Conference of London. The San Remo Resolution adopted on 25 April 1920 incorporated the Balfour Declaration of 1917. It and Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations were the basic documents upon which the British Mandate for Palestine was constructed. Under the Balfour Declaration, the British government had undertaken to favour the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine without prejudice to the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. Article 22, para.4 of the Covenant, classified certain populations as &quot;communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire&quot; as having &quot;reached a stage of development where their existence as [an] independent nation can be provisionally recognized&quot; (the Class A mandates under the League of Nations), and tasked the mandatory with rendering to those territories &quot;administrative advice and assistance until such time as they are able to stand alone&quot;
Britain received the mandate for Palestine and Iraq; France gained control of Syria, including present-day Lebanon. Following the 1918 Clemenceau–Lloyd George Agreement, Britain and France also signed the San Remo Oil Agreement, whereby Britain granted France a 25 percent share of the oil production from Mosul, with the remainder going to Britain and France undertook to deliver oil to the Mediterranean. The draft peace agreement with Turkey signed at the conference became the basis for the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres. Germany was called upon to carry out its military and reparation obligations under the Versailles Treaty, and a resolution was adopted in favor of restoring trade with Russia.

Whilst Syria and Mesopotamia were provisionally recognized as states which would be given Mandatory assistance, Palestine would instead be administered by the Mandatory under an obligation to implement the Balfour Declaration and Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. 

==San Remo Resolution – 25 April 1920==

It was agreed –

(a) To accept the terms of the Mandates Article as given below with reference to Palestine, on the understanding that there was inserted in the procès-verbal an undertaking by the Mandatory Power that this would not involve the surrender of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine; this undertaking not to refer to the question of the religious protectorate of France, which had been settled earlier in the previous afternoon by the undertaking given by the French Government that they recognized this protectorate as being at an end.

(b) that the terms of the Mandates Article should be as follows:

The High Contracting Parties agree that Syria and Mesopotamia shall, in accordance with the fourth paragraph of Article 22, Part I (Covenant of the League of Nations), be provisionally recognized as independent States, subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The boundaries of the said States will be determined, and the selection of the Mandatories made, by the Principal Allied Powers.

The High Contracting Parties agree to entrust, by application of the provisions of Article 22, the administration of Palestine, within such boundaries as may be determined by the Principal Allied Powers, to a Mandatory, to be selected by the said Powers. The Mandatory will be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on the 8th [2nd] November, 1917, by the British Government, and adopted by the other Allied Powers, in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.

&quot;La Puissance mandataire s’engage à nommer dans le plus bref delai une Commission speciale pour etudier toute question et toute reclamation concernant les differentes communautes religieuses et en etablir le reglement. Il sera tenu compte dans la composition de cette Commission des interets religieux en jeu. Le President de la Commission sera nommé par le Conseil de la Societé des Nations.&quot;
[The Mandatory undertakes to appoint in the shortest time a special commission to study any subject and any queries concerning the different religious communities and regulations. The composition of this Commission will reflect the religious interests at stake. The President of the Commission will be appointed by the Council of the League of Nations.]

The terms of the mandates in respect of the above territories will be formulated by the Principal Allied Powers and submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for approval.

Turkey hereby undertakes, in accordance with the provisions of Article [132 of the Treaty of Sèvres] to accept any decisions which may be taken in this connection.

(c) &quot;Les mandataires choisis par les principales Puissances alliés sont: la France pour la Syrie, et la Grande Bretagne pour la Mesopotamie, et la Palestine.&quot;
[The officers chosen by the principal allied Powers are: France for Syria and Great Britain for Mesopotamia and Palestine.]

In reference to the above decision the Supreme Council took note of the following reservation of the Italian Delegation:

&quot;La Delegation Italienne en consideration des grands interêts economiques que l’Italie en tant que puissance exclusivement mediterranéenne possède en Asie Mineure, reserve son approbation à la presente resolution, jusqu’au reglement des interêts italiens en Turquie d’Asie.&quot;
[The Italian delegation, in view of the great economic interests that Italy, as an exclusively Mediterranean power, possesses in Asia Minor, withholds its approval of this resolution until Italian interests in Turkey in Asia shall have been settled.]

==Subsequent events==

While Transjordan was not mentioned during the discussions, three months later, in July 1920, the French defeat of the Arab Kingdom of Syria state precipitated the British need to know &#x27;what is the &quot;Syria&quot; for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?&#x27; and &quot;does it include Transjordania?&quot; – it subsequently decided to pursue a policy of associating Transjordan with the mandated area of Palestine but not to apply the special provisions which were intended to provide a national home for the Jewish people West of the Jordan – and the French proclaimed Greater Lebanon and other component states of its Syrian mandate on 31 August 1920.
For France, the San Remo decision meant that most of its claims in Syria were internationally recognized and relations with Faisal were now subject to French military and economic considerations. The ability of Great Britain to limit French action was also significantly diminished. France issued an ultimatum and intervened militarily at the Battle of Maysalun in July 1920, deposing the Arab government and removing King Faisal from Damascus in August 1920. In 1920, Great Britain appointed Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel as high commissioner and established a mandatory government in Palestine that remained in power until 1948.

Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, which contained the general rules to be applied to all Mandated Territories, was written two months before the signing of the Versaille Peace Treaty. It was not known at that time to which territories paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 would relate. The territories which came under the regime set up by this article were three former parts of the Ottoman Empire and seven former overseas possessions of Germany referred to in Part IV, Section I, of the treaty of peace. Those 10 territorial areas were originally administered under 15 mandates.

<doc id="100616" wikidata="Q190440" url="?curid=100616" title="Parallel port">
<text>In computing, a parallel port is a type of interface found on early computers (personal and otherwise) for connecting peripherals. The name refers to the way the data is sent; parallel ports send multiple bits of data at once (parallel communication), as opposed to serial communication, in which bits are sent one at a time. To do this, parallel ports require multiple data lines in their cables and port connectors and tend to be larger than contemporary serial ports, which only require one data line.

There are many types of parallel ports, but the term has become most closely associated with the printer port or Centronics port found on most personal computers from the 1970s through the 2000s. It was an industry &quot;de facto&quot; standard for many years, and was finally standardized as IEEE 1284 in the late 1990s, which defined the Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) and Extended Capability Port (ECP) bi-directional versions. Today, the parallel port interface is virtually non-existent in new computers because of the rise of Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices, along with network printing using Ethernet and Wi-Fi connected printers.

The parallel port interface was originally known as the Parallel Printer Adapter on IBM PC-compatible computers. It was primarily designed to operate printers that used IBM&#x27;s eight-bit extended ASCII character set to print text, but could also be used to adapt other peripherals. Graphical printers, along with a host of other devices, have been designed to communicate with the system.

==History==

===Centronics===
An Wang, Robert Howard and Prentice Robinson began development of a low-cost printer at Centronics, a subsidiary of Wang Laboratories that produced specialty computer terminals. The printer used the dot matrix printing principle, with a print head consisting of a vertical row of seven metal pins connected to solenoids. When power was applied to the solenoids, the pin was pushed forward to strike the paper and leave a dot. To make a complete character glyph, the print head would receive power to specified pins to create a single vertical pattern, then the print head would move to the right by a small amount, and the process repeated. On their original design, a typical glyph was printed as a matrix seven high and five wide, while the &quot;A&quot; models used a print head with 9 pins and formed glyphs that were 9 by 7.

This left the problem of sending the ASCII data to the printer. While a serial port does so with the minimum of pins and wires, it requires the device to buffer up the data as it arrives bit by bit and turn it back into multi-bit values. A parallel port makes this simpler; the entire ASCII value is presented on the pins in complete form. In addition to the eight data pins, the system also needed various control pins as well as electrical grounds. Wang happened to have a surplus stock of 20,000 Amphenol 36-pin micro ribbon connectors that were originally used for one of their early calculators. The interface only required 21 of these pins, the rest were grounded or not connected. The connector has become so closely associated with Centronics that it is now popularly known as the &quot;Centronics connector&quot;.

The Centronics Model 101 printer, featuring this connector, was released in 1970. The host sent ASCII characters to the printer using seven of eight data pins, pulling them high to +5V to represent a 1. When the data was ready, the host pulled the &quot;STROBE&quot; pin low, to 0 V. The printer responded by pulling the &quot;BUSY&quot; line high, printing the character, and then returning BUSY to low again. The host could then send another character. Control characters in the data caused other actions, like the codice_1 or codice_2. The host could also have the printer automatically start a new line by pulling the &quot;AUTOFEED&quot; line high, and keeping it there. The host had to carefully watch the BUSY line to ensure it did not feed data to the printer too rapidly, especially given variable-time operations like a paper feed.

The printer side of the interface quickly became an industry &quot;de facto&quot; standard, but manufacturers used various connectors on the system side, so a variety of cables were required. For example, NCR used the 36-pin micro ribbon connector on both ends of the connection, early VAX systems used a DC-37 connector, Texas Instruments used a 25-pin card edge connector and Data General used a 50-pin micro ribbon connector. When IBM implemented the parallel interface on the IBM PC, they used the DB-25F connector at the PC-end of the interface, creating the now familiar parallel cable with a DB25M at one end and a 36-pin micro ribbon connector at the other.

In theory, the Centronics port could transfer data as rapidly as 75,000 characters per second. This was far faster than the printer, which averaged about 160 characters per second, meaning the port spent much of its time idle. The performance was defined by how rapidly the host could respond to the printer&#x27;s BUSY signal asking for more data. To improve performance, printers began incorporating buffers so the host could send them data more rapidly, in bursts. This not only reduced (or eliminated) delays due to latency waiting for the next character to arrive from the host, but also freed the host to perform other operations without causing a loss of performance. Performance was further improved by using the buffer to store several lines and then printing in both directions, eliminating the delay while the print head returned to the left side of the page. Such changes more than doubled the performance of an otherwise unchanged printer, as was the case on Centronics models like the 102 and 308.

===IBM===
IBM released the IBM Personal Computer in 1981 and included a variant of the Centronics interface— only IBM logo printers (rebranded from Epson) could be used with the IBM PC. IBM standardized the parallel cable with a DB25F connector on the PC side and the 36-pin Centronics connector on the printer side. Vendors soon released printers compatible with both standard Centronics and the IBM implementation.

The original IBM parallel printer adapter for the IBM PC of 1981 was designed to support limited bidirectionality, with 8 lines of data output and 4 lines of data input. This allowed the port to be used for other purposes, not just output to a printer. This was accomplished by allowing the data lines to be written to by devices on either end of the cable, which required the ports on the host to be bidirectional. This feature saw little use, and was removed in later revisions of the hardware. Years later, in 1987, IBM reintroduced the bidirectional interface with its IBM PS/2 series, where it could be enabled or disabled for compatibility with applications hardwired not to expect a printer port to be bidirectional.

===Bi-Tronics===
As the printer market expanded, new types of printing mechanisms appeared. These often supported new features and error conditions that could not be represented on the existing port&#x27;s relatively few status pins. While the IBM solution could support this, it was not trivial to implement and was not at that time being supported. This led to the Bi-Tronics system, introduced by HP on their LaserJet 4Si in April 1993. This used four existing status pins, ERROR, SELECT, PE and BUSY to represent a nibble, using two transfers to send an 8-bit value. Bi-Tronics mode, now known as nibble mode, was indicated by the host pulling the SELECT line high, and data was transferred when the host toggles the AUTOFEED low. Other changes in the handshaking protocols improved performance, reaching 400,000 cps to the printer, and about 50,000 cps back to the host. A major advantage of the Bi-Tronics system is that it can be driven entirely in software in the host, and uses otherwise unmodified hardware - all the pins used for data transfer back to the host were already printer-to-host lines.

===EPP and ECP===
The introduction of new devices like scanners and multi-function printers demanded much more performance than either the Bi-Tronics or IBM style backchannels could handle. Two other standards have become more popular for these purposes. The Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP), originally defined by Zenith Electronics, is similar to IBM&#x27;s byte mode in concept, but changes details of the handshaking to allow up to 2 MB/s. The Extended Capability Port (ECP) is essentially an entirely new port in the same physical housing that also adds direct memory access based on ISA and run-length encoding to compress the data, which is especially useful when transferring simple images like faxes or black-and-white scanned images. ECP offers performance up to 2.5 MB/s in both directions.

All of these enhancements are collected as part of the IEEE 1284 standard. The first release in 1994 included original Centronics mode (&quot;compatibility mode&quot;), nibble and byte modes, as well as a change to the handshaking that was already widely used; the original Centronics implementation called for the BUSY lead to toggle with each change on any line of data (busy-by-line), whereas IEEE 1284 calls for BUSY to toggle with each received character (busy-by-character). This reduces the number of BUSY toggles and the resulting interruptions on both sides. A 1997 update standardized the printer status codes. In 2000, the EPP and ECP modes were moved into the standard, as well as several connector and cable styles, and a method for daisy chaining up to eight devices from a single port.

Some host systems or print servers may use a strobe signal with a relatively low voltage output or a fast toggle. Any of these issues might cause no or intermittent printing, missing or repeated characters or garbage printing. Some printer models may have a switch or setting to set busy by character; others may require a handshake adapter.

===Dataproducts===
Dataproducts introduced a very different implementation of the parallel interface for their printers. It used a DC-37 connector on the host side and a 50 pin connector on the printer side—either a DD-50 (sometimes incorrectly referred to as a &quot;DB50&quot;) or the block shaped M-50 connector; the M-50 was also referred to as Winchester. Dataproducts parallel was available in a short-line for connections up to and a long-line version using differential signaling for connections to . The Dataproducts interface was found on many mainframe systems up through the 1990s, and many printer manufacturers offered the Dataproducts interface as an option.

A wide variety of devices were eventually designed to operate on a parallel port. Most devices were uni-directional (one-way) devices, only meant to respond to information sent from the PC. However, some devices such as Zip drives were able to operate in bi-directional mode. Printers also eventually took up the bi-directional system, allowing various status report information to be sent.

==Historical uses==

Before the advent of USB, the parallel interface was adapted to access a number of peripheral devices other than printers. One early use of the parallel port was for dongles used as hardware keys which were supplied with application software as a form of software copy protection. Other uses included optical disc drives such as CD readers and writers, Zip drives, scanners, tape drives, external modems, gamepads, and joysticks. Some of the earliest portable MP3 players required a parallel port connection for transferring songs to the device. Adapters were available to run SCSI devices via parallel. Other devices such as EPROM programmers and hardware controllers could be connected via the parallel port.

===Interfaces===
Most PC-compatible systems in the 1980s and 1990s had one to three ports, with communication interfaces defined like this:

*Logical parallel port 1: I/O port 0x3BC, IRQ 7 (usually in monochrome graphics adapters)
*Logical parallel port 2: I/O port 0x378, IRQ 7 (dedicated IO cards or using a controller built into the mainboard)
*Logical parallel port 3: I/O port 0x278, IRQ 5 (dedicated IO cards or using a controller built into the mainboard)

If no printer port is present at 0x3BC, the second port in the row (0x378) becomes logical parallel port 1 and 0x278 becomes logical parallel port 2 for the BIOS. Sometimes, printer ports are jumpered to share an interrupt despite having their own IO addresses (i.e. only one can be used interrupt-driven at a time). In some cases, the BIOS supports a fourth printer port as well, but the base address for it differs significantly between vendors. Since the reserved entry for a fourth logical printer port in the BIOS Data Area (BDA) is shared with other uses on PS/2 machines and with S3 compatible graphics cards, it typically requires special drivers in most environments.
Under DR-DOS 7.02 the BIOS port assignments can be changed and overridden using the LPT1, LPT2, LPT3 (and optionally LPT4) CONFIG.SYS directives.

===Access===
DOS-based systems make the logical parallel ports detected by the BIOS available under device names such as &quot;LPT1&quot;, &quot;LPT2&quot; or &quot;LPT3&quot; (corresponding with logical parallel port 1, 2, and 3, respectively). These names derive from terms like Line Print Terminal, Local Print Terminal (both abbreviated as LPT), or Line Printer. A similar naming convention was used on ITS, DEC systems, as well as in CP/M and 86-DOS (&quot;LST&quot;).

In DOS, the parallel printers could be accessed directly on the command line. For example, the command &quot;codice_3&quot; would redirect the contents of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to the printer port. A PRN device was also available as an alias for LPT1. Some operating systems (like Multiuser DOS) allow to change this fixed assignment by different means. Some DOS versions use resident driver extensions provided by MODE, or users can change the mapping internally via a CONFIG.SYS PRN=n directive (as under DR-DOS 7.02 and higher). DR-DOS 7.02 also provides optional built-in support for &quot;LPT4&quot; if the underlying BIOS supports it.

PRN, along with CON, AUX and a few others are invalid file and directory names in DOS and Windows, even on Windows XP and later. This set of invalid file and directory names also affects Windows 95 and 98, which had an MS-DOS device in path name vulnerability in which it causes the computer to crash if the user types &quot;C:\CON\CON&quot;, &quot;C:\PRN\PRN&quot; or &quot;C:\AUX\AUX&quot; in the Windows Explorer address bar or via the Run command. Microsoft has since released a patch to fix this issue, however new installations of Windows 95 and 98 are not patched with this fix and will still have this issue.

A special &quot;codice_4&quot; command also existed to achieve the same effect. Microsoft Windows still refers to the ports in this manner in many cases, though this is often fairly hidden.

In SCO UNIX and Linux, the first parallel port is available via the filesystem as codice_5. Linux IDE devices can use a &quot;paride&quot; (parallel port IDE) driver.

==Current use==
For consumers, USB and computer networks have replaced the parallel printer port, for connections both to printers and to other devices.

Many manufacturers of personal computers and laptops consider parallel to be a legacy port and no longer include the parallel interface. Smaller machines have less room for large parallel port connectors. USB-to-parallel adapters are available that can make parallel-only printers work with USB-only systems.
There are PCI (and PCI-express) cards that provide parallel ports. There are also some print servers that provide an interface to parallel ports through a network. USB-to-EPP chips can also allow other non-printer devices to continue to work on modern computers without a parallel port.

For electronics hobbyists the parallel port is still often the easiest way to connect to an external circuit board. It is faster than the other common legacy port (serial port), requires no serial-to-parallel converter, and requires far less interface logic and software than a USB target interface. However, Microsoft operating systems later than Windows 95/98 prevent user programs from directly writing to or reading from the LPT without additional software (kernel extensions).

CNC Milling Machines also often make use of the parallel port to directly control the machine&#x27;s motors and attachments, especially with LinuxCNC OS.

==IBM PC implementation==

=== Port addresses ===
Traditionally IBM PC systems have allocated their first three parallel ports according to the configuration in the table below (if all three printer ports exist).
If there is an unused slot, the port addresses of the others are moved up. (For example, if a port at 0x3BC does not exist, the port at 0x378 will then become the first logical parallel port.) The base address 0x3BC is typically supported by printer ports on MDA and Hercules display adapters, whereas printer ports provided by the mainboard chipset or add-on cards rarely allow to be configured to this base address. Therefore, in absence of a monochrome display adapter, a common assignment for the first logical parallel port (and therefore also for the corresponding LPT1 DOS device driver) today is 0x378, even though the default is still 0x3BC (and would be selected by the BIOS if it detects a printer port at this address). The IRQ lines are typically configurable in the hardware as well. Assigning the same interrupt to more than one printer port should be avoided and will typically cause one of the corresponding ports to work in polled mode only. The port addresses assigned to slot can be determined by reading the BIOS Data Area (BDA) at 0000h:0408h.

Bit-to-pin mapping for the Standard Parallel Port (SPP):
~ indicates a hardware inversion of the bit.

=== Program interface ===
In versions of Windows that did not use the Windows NT kernel (as well as DOS and some other operating systems), programs could access the parallel port with simple outportb() and inportb() subroutine commands. In operating systems such as Windows NT and Unix (NetBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, 386BSD, etc.), the microprocessor is operated in a different security ring, and access to the parallel port is prohibited, unless using the required driver. This improves security and arbitration of device contention. On Linux, inb() and outb() can be used when a process is run as root and an ioperm() command is used to allow access to its base address; alternatively, ppdev allows shared access and can be used from userspace if the appropriate permissions are set.

The cross-platform library for parallel port access, libieee1284, also is available on many Linux distributions and provides an abstract interface to the parallel ports of the system. Access is handled in an open-claim-release-close sequence, which allows for concurrent access in userspace.

==Pinouts==
The older parallel printer ports had an 8-bit data bus and four pins for control output (Strobe, Linefeed, Initialize, and Select In), and five more for control input (ACK, Busy, Select, Error, and Paper Out). Its data transfer speed is at 150 kB/s. It is possible for a parallel port to have a speed of 300 KB/s.

The newer EPPs (Enhanced Parallel Ports) have an 8-bit data bus, and the same control pins as the normal parallel printer port. Newer ports reach speeds of up to 2 MB/s.

Pinouts for parallel port connectors are:
Inverted lines are true on logic low. If they are not inverted, then logic high is true.

Pin 25 on the DB25 connector might not be connected to ground on modern computers.

<text>The 3rd Dalai Lama, Sonam Gyatso (; 1543–1588), was the first in the tulku lineage to be entitled formally as the Dalai Lama. In 1578 Altan Khan presented the spiritual title of Dalai Lama, in honor of Sonam Gyatso&#x27;s profound teachings conferred in Mongolia, which soon became a Tibetan Buddhist country. He founded Kumbum Monastery, Lithang Monastery, and Namgyal Monastery. The spiritual title was retrospectively given to his two tulku lineage predecessors, the 1st Dalai Lama and the 2nd Dalai Lama.

Sonam Gyatso was born near Lhasa in 1543 and was recognised as the reincarnation of Gendun Gyatso and subsequently enthroned at Drepung Monastery by Panchen Sonam Dragpa, who became his tutor. Panchen Sonam Dragpa was the 15th Ganden Tripa and his texts still serve as the core curriculum for many Gelug monasteries. The 3rd Dalai Lama studied at Drepung Monastery and became its abbot. His reputation spread quickly and the monks at Sera Monastery also recognised him as their abbot.

According to Sumpa Khenpo, the great Gelug scholar, he also studied Nyingma tantric doctrines.

When one of Tibet&#x27;s regional kings, who had been supported by the Kagyu school, died in 1564, Sonam Gyatso presided over his funeral. His political power, and that of the Gelug school, grew in dominance in Tibet by the 1570s.

==Origin of the title &quot;Dalai Lama&quot;==
The title &quot;Dalai Lama&quot; was first bestowed by Altan Khan upon Sonam Gyatso in 1578, when Altan Khan was a Chinese Prince of Shunyi during the Ming Dynasty (Wang, 顺义王) of China. The spiritual title of &quot;Dalai Lama&quot; was derived from the Mongolian &quot;Dalai-yin qan&quot; (or Dalaiin khan) one.

Since the time of Genghis Khan, only people who were of his royal lineage were allowed to rule Mongolia. This frustrated many would-be rulers who were not of this line. Altan Khan was the most destructive of these usurpers. He perceived that through the Buddhist faith he could gain legitimacy by claiming to be a reincarnation of Kublai Khan.

Altan Khan chose the Gelug order of Tibetan Buddhism (founded by Tsongkhapa, 1357–1419). In 1577 he invited the leader of this order, Sonam Gyatsho, to come to Mongolia and teach his people. At some point, Sonam Gyatso proclaimed Altan Khan to be the reincarnation of Kublai Khan.

In response to Sonam Gyatso&#x27;s teachings, Altan Khan conferred the title of Dalai Lama on Sonam Gyatso. Altan Khan posthumously awarded the title to his two predecessors, making Sonam Gyatso the 3rd Dalai Lama.

==Altan Khan and the conversion of Mongolia==
Sonam Gyatso, a monk of the Gelug (Yellow Hat) school of Tibetan Buddhism, was in a position of finding a foreign patron for the Gelug school. He established a &quot;cho-yon&quot; or priest and patron relationship with Altan Khan, ruler of numerous Mongol tribes and a prince of Ming China. At the time, the Mongolians were not united under a single religion. Their practices instead consisted of superstition, indigenous religious conceptions, and shamanism. However, Sonam Gyatso was against shamanism and its idols.

Altan Khan first invited Sonam Gyatso to Tümed in 1569, but apparently the Dalai Lama refused to go and sent a disciple, who reported back to the Dalai Lama about the great opportunity to spread Buddhist teachings throughout Mongolia. In 1573 Altan Khan took some Tibetan Buddhist monks prisoner.

Altan Khan invited Sonam Gyatso to Mongolia again and embraced Tibetan Buddhism. After some hesitation, with followers begging him not to go, Sonam Gyatso&#x27;s party set out and was met at Ahrik Karpatang in Mongolia where a specially prepared camp had been set up to receive them. Thousands of animals were given to him as offerings and five hundred horsemen had been sent to escort him to Altan Khan&#x27;s court. When they arrived there, they were greeted by over ten thousand people, including Altan Khan dressed in a white robe to symbolize his devotion to the Dharma.

Some sources say this first meeting between Sonam Gyatso and Altan Khan took place in Amdo near Lake Kokonor, which was heavily populated by Mongolian peoples. 

While Altan Khan bestowed the title &quot;Dalai&quot; on Sonam Gyatso, the latter gave the title of &quot;Brahma&quot;, the king of religion, to Altan Khan.

Altan Khan had Thegchen Chonkhor, Mongolia&#x27;s first monastery, built, and a massive program of translating Tibetan texts into Mongolian was commenced. Within 50 years most Mongolians had become Buddhist, with tens of thousands of monks who were members of the Gelug school, loyal to the Dalai Lama.

Sonam Gyatso&#x27;s message was that the time had come for Mongolia to embrace Buddhism, that from that time on there should be no more animal sacrifices, the images of the old gods were to be destroyed, there must be no taking of life, animal or human, military action must be given up and the immolation of women on the funeral pyres of their husbands must be abolished. He also secured an edict abolishing the Mongolian custom of blood-sacrifices. &quot;These and many other such laws were set forth by Gyalwa Sonam Gyatso and were instituted by Altan Khan.&quot;

The 3rd Dalai Lama publicly announced that he was a reincarnation of Drogön Chögyal Phagpa, while Altan Khan was a reincarnation of Kublai Khan, and that they had come together again to cooperate in propagating Buddhism.

The alliance with the Mongolians would later prove instrumental in establishing the Gelug school as the spiritual and political leaders of Tibet during the reign of the Great Fifth Dalai Lama.

Altan Khan died in 1582, only four years after meeting with the 3rd Dalai Lama. According to legend, Abtai Sain Khan was given a Buddha relic by the 3rd Dalai Lama to help in the spread of Buddhism.

Altan Khan was succeeded by his son Sengge Düüreng who continued to diligently support Buddhism, and two years later the 3rd Dalai Lama made another visit to Mongolia. On his way, he founded the monastery of Kumbum at the birthplace of the great teacher and reformer, Je Tsongkhapa.

Gyalwa Sonam Gyatso had also founded Lithang monastery in Eastern Tibet, as well as the small monastery Phende Lekshe Ling in either 1564 or 1565, which became known as Namgyal Monastery in 1571, the personal monastery of all the subsequent Dalai Lamas. By 1585, he was back in Mongolia and converted more Mongolian princes and their tribes.

In October of 1587, Gyalwa Sonam Gyatso was promoted to Duǒ Er Zhǐ Chàng (朵儿只唱) by the emperor of China, and seal of authority was given. 

The Dalai Lama was again invited to meet the Ming emperor, and this time he accepted but fell ill and died in 1588, at the age of 45,) in Mongolia while returning to Tibet.

Altan Khan&#x27;s great-grandson, Yonten Gyatso, was identified as the 4th Dalai Lama.

&quot;To others give the victory and the spoils; The loss and defeat, take upon oneself&quot; — Sonam Gyatso.

<text>Hans Theodor Woldsen Storm (; 14 September 18174 July 1888), commonly known as Theodor Storm, was a German-Frisian writer and poet. He is considered to be one of the most important figures of German realism.

==Life==
Storm was born in the small town of Husum, on the west coast of Schleswig, then a formally independent duchy ruled by the king of Denmark. His parents were the lawyer Johann Casimir Storm (1790–1874) and Lucie Storm, née Woldsen (1797–1879).

Storm attended school in Husum and Lübeck and studied law in Kiel and Berlin. While still a law student in Kiel he published a first volume of verse together with the brothers Tycho and Theodor Mommsen (1843).

Storm was involved in the 1848 revolutions and sympathized with the liberal goals of a united Germany under a constitutional monarchy in which every class could participate in the political process. From 1843 until his admission was revoked by Danish authorities in 1852, he worked as a lawyer in his home town of Husum. In 1853 Storm moved to Potsdam, moving on to Heiligenstadt in Thuringia in 1856. He returned to Husum in 1865 after Schleswig had come under Prussian rule and became a district magistrate (&quot;Landvogt&quot;). In 1880 Storm moved to Hademarschen, where he spent the last years of his life writing, and died of cancer at the age of 70.

Storm was married twice, first to Konstanze Esmarch, who died in 1864, and then to Dorothea Jensen.

==Work==
Storm was one of the most important authors of 19th-century German Literary realism. He wrote a number of stories, poems and novellas. His two best-known works are the novellas &quot;Immensee&quot; (1849) and &quot;Der Schimmelreiter&quot; (&quot;The Rider on the White Horse&quot;), first published in April 1888 in the &quot;Deutsche Rundschau&quot;. Other published works include a volume of his poems (1852), the novella &quot;Pole Poppenspäler&quot; (1874) and the novella &quot;Aquis submersus&quot; (1877).

== Analysis ==
Like Friedrich Hebbel, Theodor Storm was a child of the North Sea plain, but, whilst in Hebbel&#x27;s verse there is hardly any direct reference to his native landscape, Storm again and again revisits the chaste beauty of its expansive mudflats, menacing sea and barren pastures — and whilst Hebbel could find a home away from his native heath Storm clung to it with what may be called a jealous love. In &quot;Der Schimmelreiter&quot;, the last of his 50 novellas and widely considered Storm&#x27;s culminating masterpiece, the setting of the rural North German coast is central to evoking its unnerving, superstitious atmosphere, and sets the stage for the battleground of man versus nature: the dykes and the sea.

His favourite poets were Joseph von Eichendorff and Eduard Mörike, and the influence of the former is plainly discernible even in Storm&#x27;s later verse. During a summer visit to Baden-Baden in 1864, where he had been invited by his friend, the author and painter Ludwig Pietsch, he made the acquaintance of the great Russian writer Ivan Turgenev. They exchanged letters and sent each other copies of their works over a number of years.

Hungarian literary critic Georg Lukács, in &quot;Soul and Form&quot; (1911), appraised Storm as &quot;the last representative of the great German bourgeois literary tradition,&quot; poised between Jeremias Gotthelf and Thomas Mann.

<text>Jef Raskin (born Jeff Raskin; March 9, 1943 – February 26, 2005) was an American human–computer interface expert who conceived and began leading the Macintosh project at Apple in the late 1970s.

==Early life and education==
Jef Raskin was born in New York City to a secular Jewish family, whose surname is a matronymic from &quot;Raske&quot;, Yiddish nickname for Rachel. He received a BA in mathematics and a BS in physics with minors in philosophy and music from Stony Brook University. In 1967, he received a master&#x27;s degree in computer science from Pennsylvania State University, after having switched from mathematical logic due to differences of opinion with his advisor. Even though he had completed work typical for a PhD, the university was not accredited for a PhD in computer science. The first original computer application he wrote was a music application as part of his master&#x27;s thesis.

Raskin later enrolled in a graduate music program at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), but quit to teach art, photography, and computer science there. He worked as an assistant professor in the Visual Arts department from 1968 until 1974. There, he presented shows about toys as works of art. Raskin announced his resignation from the assistant professorship by flying over the Chancellor&#x27;s house in a hot air balloon. He was awarded a National Science Foundation grant to establish a Computer and Humanities center which used several 16-bit Data General Nova computers and CRTs rather than the teletypes which were more common.

Along with his undergraduate student Jonathan (Jon) Collins, Raskin developed the FLOW programming language for use in teaching programming to the art and humanities students. The language was first used at the Humanities Summer Training Institute held in 1970 at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas. The language has only seven statements (, codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, and codice_6) and can not manipulate numbers. The language was first implemented in Fortran by Collins in under a week. Later versions of the language utilized &quot;typing amplification&quot; in which only the first letter is typed and the computer provides the balance of the instruction eliminating typing errors. It was also the basis for programming classes taught by Raskin and Collins in the UCSD Visual Arts Department.

Raskin curated several art shows including one featuring his collection of unusual toys, and presenting toys as works of art. During this period, he changed the spelling of his name from &quot;Jeff&quot; to &quot;Jef&quot; after having met Jon Collins and liking the lack of extraneous letters.

Raskin occasionally wrote for computer publications, such as &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;. He formed a company named Bannister and Crun, which was named for two characters playing in the BBC radio comedy &quot;The Goon Show&quot;.

==Career history==
===Apple===
====Contractor writer====
Raskin first met Apple Computer co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in their garage workshop following the debut of their Apple II personal computer at the first West Coast Computer Faire. Jobs hired Raskin&#x27;s company Bannister and Crun to write the Apple II BASIC Programming Manual. Raskin said &quot;I was talking fifty dollars a page. They talked fifty dollars for the whole manual.&quot; Upon the Apple II unit with the serial number of &quot;2&quot;, he reportedly wrote &quot;a literate manual that became a standard for the young industry&quot;.

====Management====
In January 1978, Raskin joined Apple as Manager of Publications, the company&#x27;s 31st employee. For some time he continued as Director of Publications and New Product Review, and also worked on packaging and other issues. He had concealed his degree in computer science, out of concern for cultural bias against academia among the hobby-driven personal computer industry. He explained, &quot;If they had known ... they might not have let me in the company, because there was such an antiacademic bias in the early Apple days.&quot;

From his responsibility for documentation and testing, Raskin had great influence on early engineering projects. Because the Apple II only displayed uppercase characters on a 40-column screen, his department used the PolyMorphic Systems 8813 (an Intel-8080-based machine running a proprietary operating system called Exec) to write documentation; this spurred the development of an 80-column display card and a suitable text editor for the Apple II. His experiences testing Applesoft BASIC inspired him to design a competing product, called Notzo BASIC, which was never implemented. When Wozniak developed the first disk drives for the Apple II, Raskin went back to his contacts at UCSD and encouraged them to port the UCSD P-System operating system (incorporating a version of the Pascal programming language) to it, which Apple later licensed and shipped as Apple Pascal.

Through this time, Raskin continually wrote memos about how the personal computer could become a true consumer appliance. While the Apple III was under development in 1978 and &#x27;79, Raskin was lobbying for Apple to create a radically different kind of computer that was designed from the start to be easy to use. In &quot;Computers by the Millions&quot;, he stated that expandable computers like the Apple II were too complex, and development was difficult due to the unknown nature of the machine the program ran on. The machine he envisioned was very different from the Macintosh that was eventually released and had much more in common with PDAs than modern desktop-based machines.

====Macintosh====

Raskin started the Macintosh project in 1979 to implement some of these ideas. He later hired his former student Bill Atkinson from UCSD to Apple, along with Andy Hertzfeld and Burrell Smith from the Apple Service Department, which was located in the same building as the Publications Department. Secretly bypassing Jobs&#x27;s ego and authority by continually securing permission and funding directly at the executive level, Raskin created and solely supervised the Macintosh project for approximately its first year. This included selecting the name of his favorite apple, writing the mission document &quot;The Book of Macintosh&quot;, securing office space, and recruiting and managing the original staff. Author Steven Levy said, &quot;It was Raskin who provided the powerful vision of a computer whose legacy would be low cost, high utility, and a groundbreaking friendliness.&quot;

The prototype was similar in power to the Apple II and included a small black-and-white character display and floppy drive, in a small case. It was text only, as Raskin disliked the computer mouse or anything else that could take his hands from the keyboard. Several basic applications were built into the machine, selectable by pressing function keys. The machine included logic to understand user intentions and switch programs dynamically. For instance, if the user simply started typing text it switched into editor mode, and if numbers are typed it switched to calculator mode. In many cases these switches were largely invisible to the user.
In 1981, after the Lisa team had &quot;kicked him out&quot;, Steve Jobs&#x27;s attention drew toward Raskin&#x27;s Macintosh project, intending to combine the Xerox PARC-inspired GUI-based Lisa design to Raskin&#x27;s appliance-computing, &quot;computers-by-the-millions&quot; concept. Steve Wozniak, who around then had been co-leading the Macintosh team with Raskin, was on hiatus from the company following a traumatic airplane accident, allowing Jobs to take managerial lead over the project.

Raskin is credited as one of the first to introduce Jobs and the Lisa engineers to the PARC concepts, though he ultimately dismissed PARC&#x27;s technology and opposed the use of the mouse. Raskin claimed to have had continued direct input into the eventual Mac design, including the decision to use a one-button mouse as part of the Apple interface, instead of PARC&#x27;s 3-button mouse. Others, including Larry Tesler, acknowledge his advocacy for a one-button mouse but say that it was a decision reached simultaneously by others at Apple who had stronger authority on the issue. Raskin later stated that were he to redesign the mouse, it would have three clearly labeled buttons—two buttons on top marked &quot;Select&quot; and &quot;Activate&quot;, and a &quot;Grab&quot; button on the side that could be used by squeezing the mouse. It has the three described buttons (two invisible), but they are assigned to different functions than Raskin specified for his own interface and can be customized.

In 2005, Macintosh project member Andy Hertzfeld remembered Raskin&#x27;s reputation for often inaccurately claiming to have invented various technologies. Raskin&#x27;s resume from 2002 lends credence by stating he was &quot;Creator of Macintosh computer at Apple Computer, Inc.&quot; Raskin conceived and solely supervised the Macintosh project for approximately its first year; however, Hertzfeld describes Raskin&#x27;s relationship to the drastically different finished Mac product more like that of an &quot;eccentric great uncle&quot; than its father. In Jobs&#x27;s &quot;Lost Interview&quot; from 1996, he refers to the Macintosh as a product of team effort while acknowledging Raskin&#x27;s early role. Jobs reportedly co-opted some of Raskin&#x27;s leadership philosophies, such as when he wrote the slogan on the Macintosh group&#x27;s easel, &quot;It&#x27;s better to be a pirate than to join the Navy.&quot;

Apple acknowledged Raskin&#x27;s role after he had left the company by gifting him the millionth Macintosh computer, with an engraved brass plaque on the front.

===Pioneering the information appliance===
Raskin left Apple in 1982 and formed Information Appliance, Inc. to implement the concepts of his original Macintosh concept. The first product is the SwyftCard, a firmware card for the Apple II containing an integrated application suite, also released on a disk as SwyftWare. Information Appliance later developed the Swyft as a stand-alone laptop computer. Raskin licensed this design to Canon, which shipped a similar desktop product as the Canon Cat. Released in 1987, the unit had an innovative interface that attracted much interest but it did not become a commercial success. Raskin claimed that its failure was due in some part to Steve Jobs, who successfully pitched Canon on the NeXT Computer at about the same time. It has also been suggested that Canon canceled the Cat due to internal rivalries within its divisions. After running a cryptic full-page advertisement in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that the &quot;Canon Cat is coming&quot; months before it was available, Canon failed to follow through, never airing the completed TV advertisement at launch, only allowed the Cat to be sold by its typewriter sales people, and prevented Raskin from selling the Cat directly with a TV demonstration of how easy it was to use. Shortly thereafter, the stock market crash of 1987 so panicked Information Appliance&#x27;s venture capitalists that they drained millions of dollars from the company, depriving it of the capital needed to be able to manufacture and sell the Swyft.

Raskin wrote a book, &quot;The Humane Interface&quot; (2000), in which he developed his ideas about human-computer interfaces.

Raskin was a long-time member of BAYCHI, the Bay-Area Computer-Human Interface group, a professional organization for human-interface designers. He presented papers on his own work, reviewed the human interfaces of various consumer products (such as a BMW car he&#x27;d been asked to review), and discussed the work of his colleagues in various companies and universities.

At the start of the new millennium, Raskin undertook the building of a new computer interface based on his 30 years of work and research, called The Humane Environment, THE. On January 1, 2005, he renamed it Archy. It is a system incarnating his concepts of the humane interface, by using open source elements within his rendition of a ZUI or Zooming User Interface. In the same period, Raskin accepted an appointment as adjunct professor of computer science at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Computer Science Department and, with Leo Irakliotis, started designing a new curriculum on humane interfaces and computer enterprises.

His work is being extended and carried on by his son Aza Raskin at Humanized, a company that was started shortly after Raskin&#x27;s death to continue his legacy. Humanized released Enso, a linguistic command-line interface, which is based on Jef&#x27;s work and dedicated in his memory. In early 2008, Humanized became part of Mozilla.

The Archy project never included a functional ZUI, but a third party developed a commercial application called Raskin inspired by the same Zoomworld ZUI idea.

====Cognetics====
Raskin expanded the meaning of the term &quot;cognetics&quot; in his book &quot;The Humane Interface&quot; to mean &quot;the ergonomics of the mind&quot;. According to Raskin Center, &quot;Cognetics brings interface design out of the mystic realm of guruism, transforming it into an engineering discipline with a rigorous theoretical framework.&quot;

The term cognetics had earlier been coined and trademarked by Charles Kreitzberg in 1982 when he started Cognetics Corporation, one of the first user experience design companies. It is also used to describe educational programs intended to foster thinking skills in grades 3-12 (US) and for Cognetics, Inc., an economic research firm founded by David L. Birch, a professor at MIT.

Raskin discouraged using the informal term &quot;intuitive&quot; in user interface design, claiming that easy to use interfaces are often due to exposure to previous, similar systems, thus the term &quot;familiar&quot; should be preferred. Aiming for &quot;intuitive&quot; interfaces (based on reusing existing skills with interaction systems) could lead designers to discard a better design solution only because it would require a novel approach.

==Outside interests==
Raskin had interests other than computers. He conducted the San Francisco Chamber Opera Society and played various instruments, including the organ and the recorder. His artwork was displayed at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art as part of its permanent collection, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the University of California, San Diego. He received a patent for airplane wing construction, and designed and marketed radio controlled model gliders.

He was an accomplished archer, target shooter, bicycle racer and an occasional model race car driver. He was a musician and composer, publishing a series of collected recorder studies using the pseudonym of Aabel Aabius. In his later years he also wrote freelance articles for Macintosh magazines, such as &quot;Mac Home Journal&quot;, and many modeling magazines, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Wired&quot;, and computing journals. One of his favorite pastimes was to play music with his children. He accompanied them on the piano while they played or sang while going through old fake-books passed down from his father. They routinely improvised together.

Raskin owned Jef&#x27;s Friends, a small company which made model airplane kits.

He was a toy designer. He designed Space Expander, a hanging cloth maze for a person to walk through. He designed Bloxes, a set of interlocking wood blocks.

One of Raskin&#x27;s instruments was the organ. In 1978 he published an article in &quot;BYTE&quot; on using computers with the instrument.

Raskin published a paper highly critical of pseudoscience in nursing, such as therapeutic touch and Rogerian science, wherein he said: &quot;Unlike science, nursing theory has no built-in mechanisms for rejecting falsehoods, tautologies, and irrelevancies.&quot;

==Personal life==
Jef Raskin married Linda S. Blum in 1982. They had three children together—Aza, Aviva, and Aenea, with honorary surrogate siblings R. Fureigh and Jenna Mandis. In 1985, Raskin described his house as &quot;practically one large playground&quot;, with secret doors and passageways, an auditorium that seats 185, and a model airplane room. He said, &quot;I decided when I grew up I was not going to give up the things I liked doing, and I&#x27;ve not.&quot;

He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in December 2004 and died in Pacifica, California, on February 26, 2005, at age 61.

<doc id="100625" wikidata="Q664575" url="?curid=100625" title="Inverter (logic gate)">
<text>In digital logic, an inverter or NOT gate is a logic gate which implements logical negation. It outputs a bit opposite of the bit that is put into it. The bits are typically implemented as two differing voltage levels.

==Description==

The NOT gate outputs a zero when given a one, and a one when given a zero. Hence, it inverts its inputs. Colloquially, this inversion of bits is called &quot;flipping&quot; bits. As with all binary logic gates, other pairs of symbols such as true and false, or high and low may be used in lieu of one and zero.

It is equivalent to the logical negation operator (¬) in mathematical logic. Because it has only one input, it is a unary operation and has the simplest type of truth table. It is also called the complement gate because it produces the ones&#x27; complement of a binary number, swapping 0s and 1s. 

The NOT gate is one of three basic logic gates from which any Boolean circuit may be built up. Together with the AND gate and the OR gate, any function in binary mathematics may be implemented. All other logic gates may be made from these three.

The terms &quot;programmable inverter&quot; or &quot;controlled inverter&quot; do not refer to this gate; instead, these terms refer to the XOR gate because it can conditionally function like a NOT gate.

==Symbols==

The traditional symbol for an inverter circuit is a triangle touching a small circle or &quot;bubble&quot;. Input and output lines are attached to the symbol; the bubble is typically attached to the output line. To symbolize active-low input, sometimes the bubble is instead placed on the input line. Sometimes only the circle portion of the symbol is used, and it is attached to the input or output of another gate; the symbols for NAND and NOR are formed in this way.

A bar or overline ( ‾ ) above a variable can denote negation (or inversion or complement) performed by a NOT gate. A slash (/) before the variable is also used.

==Electronic implementation==
An inverter circuit outputs a voltage representing the opposite logic-level to its input. Its main function is to invert the input signal applied. If the applied input is low then the output becomes high and vice versa. Inverters can be constructed using a single NMOS transistor or a single PMOS transistor coupled with a resistor. Since this &quot;resistive-drain&quot; approach uses only a single type of transistor, it can be fabricated at a low cost. However, because current flows through the resistor in one of the two states, the resistive-drain configuration is disadvantaged for power consumption and processing speed. Alternatively, inverters can be constructed using two complementary transistors in a CMOS configuration. This configuration greatly reduces power consumption since one of the transistors is always off in both logic states. Processing speed can also be improved due to the relatively low resistance compared to the NMOS-only or PMOS-only type devices. Inverters can also be constructed with bipolar junction transistors (BJT) in either a resistor–transistor logic (RTL) or a transistor–transistor logic (TTL) configuration.

Digital electronics circuits operate at fixed voltage levels corresponding to a logical 0 or 1 (see binary). An inverter circuit serves as the basic logic gate to swap between those two voltage levels. Implementation determines the actual voltage, but common levels include (0, +5V) for TTL circuits.

===Digital building block===
The inverter is a basic building block in digital electronics. Multiplexers, decoders, state machines, and other sophisticated digital devices may use inverters.

The &quot;hex inverter&quot; is an integrated circuit that contains six (&quot;&quot;) inverters. For example, the 7404 TTL chip which has 14 pins and the 4049 CMOS chip which has 16 pins, 2 of which are used for power/referencing, and 12 of which are used by the inputs and outputs of the six inverters (the 4049 has 2 pins with no connection).

==== Analytical representation ====
formula_1 is the analytical representation of NOT gate:
* formula_2
* formula_3

=== Alternatives ===

If no specific NOT gates are available, one can be made from the universal NAND or NOR gates, or an XOR gate by setting one input to high.

===Performance measurement===
Digital inverter quality is often measured using the voltage transfer curve (VTC), which is a plot of output vs. input voltage. From such a graph, device parameters including noise tolerance, gain, and operating logic levels can be obtained.

Ideally, the VTC appears as an inverted step function – this would indicate precise switching between &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; – but in real devices, a gradual transition region exists. The VTC indicates that for low input voltage, the circuit outputs high voltage; for high input, the output tapers off towards the low level. The slope of this transition region is a measure of quality – steep (close to vertical) slopes yield precise switching.

The tolerance to noise can be measured by comparing the minimum input to the maximum output for each region of operation (on / off).

==== Linear region as analog amplifier ====
Since the transition region is steep and approximately linear, a properly-biased CMOS inverter digital logic gate may be used as a high-gain analog linear amplifier or even combined to form an opamp. Maximum gain is achieved when the input and output operating points are the same voltage, which can be biased by connecting a resistor between the output and input.

<doc id="100626" wikidata="Q641636" url="?curid=100626" title="Bene Gesserit">
<text>The Bene Gesserit () are a group in Frank Herbert&#x27;s fictional &quot;Dune&quot; universe. A powerful social, religious, and political force, the Bene Gesserit is described as an exclusive sisterhood whose members train their bodies and minds through years of physical and mental conditioning to obtain superhuman powers and abilities that seem magical to outsiders. The group seeks to acquire power and influence to direct humanity on an enlightened path, a concerted effort planned and executed over millennia.

Members who have acquired the breadth of Bene Gesserit abilities are called Reverend Mothers; some outsiders call them &quot;witches&quot; for their secretive nature and misunderstood powers. As the skills of a Bene Gesserit are as desirable as an alliance with the Sisterhood itself, they are able to charge a fee to teach women from Great Houses, and install some of their initiates as wives and concubines to their advantage. Loyal only to themselves and their collective goals, Bene Gesserit sometimes feign other loyalties to attain their goals and avoid outside interference.

The Bene Gesserit are primary characters in all of Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; novels, as well as the prequels and sequels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. They also feature prominently in the multiple adaptations of the &quot;Dune&quot; series: the 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;; the 2000 TV miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;; and its 2003 sequel, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;; as well as the 2021 feature film &quot;Dune&quot;, and its 2024 sequel, &quot;&quot;. A television series based on the Bene Gesserit, called &quot;&quot;, debuted on November 17, 2024, on Max.

Some of their fictional powers are analyzed and deconstructed from a real-world scientific perspective in the book &quot;The Science of Dune&quot; (2008).

== Plotlines ==

===Original &quot;Dune&quot; series===
In Frank Herbert&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;Dune&quot;, the Bene Gesserit are a secretive matriarchal order who have achieved superhuman abilities through physical and mental conditioning and the use of the drug melange. Under the guise of humbly &quot;serving&quot; the Empire, the Sisterhood is in fact a major power in the universe, using its many areas of influence to subtly guide humanity along the path of its own plan for humanity&#x27;s future. Herbert notes that over 10,000 years before the events of &quot;Dune&quot;, in the chaotic time after the Butlerian Jihad and before the unveiling of the Orange Catholic Bible, the Bene Gesserit &quot;consolidated their hold upon the sorceresses, explored the subtle narcotics, developed &quot;prana-bindu&quot; training and conceived the Missionaria Protectiva, that black arm of superstition. But it is also the period that saw the composing of the litany against fear and the assembly of the Azhar Book, that bibliographic marvel that preserves the great secrets of the most ancient faiths.&quot;

Millennia later in &quot;Dune&quot;, the Bene Gesserit base of power is the Mother School on the planet Wallach IX, whose graduates are fit mates for Emperors, and whose specially trained Truthsayers can detect falsehood. But beyond the outer virtues of poise, self-control, and diplomacy, Bene Gesserit training includes superior combat skills and precise physiological control that grants them total control over their bodies, including direct control over conception and embryotic sex determination, ageing, and even the ability to render poisons harmless within their bodies. The Bene Gesserit power of Voice allows them to control others by merely modulating their vocal tones. Sisters who survive a ritualized poisoning known as the spice agony achieve increased awareness and abilities through access to Other Memory, and are subsequently known as Reverend Mothers. Every member of the Bene Gesserit is conditioned into singular loyalty to the order and its goals with allegiances to even family being secondary, and no goal is more paramount than the Sisterhood&#x27;s large-scale breeding program. It aims to create a superbeing that can tap into abilities even the Bene Gesserit cannot, a being whom they can use in order to gain more direct control over the universe. To this end, the Bene Gesserit have subtly manipulated bloodlines for generations, using breeding sisters to &quot;collect&quot; the genes they require.

The Bene Gesserit super-being – whom they call the Kwisatz Haderach – arrives a generation earlier than expected in the form of Paul Atreides, who is free from their direct control though his mother is the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Paul seizes control of the harsh desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the all-important spice melange; by threatening to destroy all spice production, he maneuvers himself onto the Imperial throne. With Paul holding a tight monopoly on melange, a decade later the Bene Gesserit participate in a conspiracy to topple his rule in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969). Even after a blinded Paul walks into the desert to die, his sister Alia rules his empire and keeps the Bene Gesserit at bay until Paul&#x27;s young son Leto II takes control himself in &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976). Over 3,500 years later, Leto – now a hybrid of human and sandworm – still dominates the universe as the tyrant God Emperor in &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; (1981). Through prescience, he foresees humanity&#x27;s possible destruction, and has forced humanity into what he calls the Golden Path, a plan which he believes will assure their survival. Having halted all spice production and thus making his own stockpile the only source of melange left in the universe, Leto is able to maintain firm control over the various factions and effects a &quot;forced tranquility&quot;. He takes the Bene Gesserit breeding program from them and uses it for his own mysterious purposes, and their limited spice supply is conditional on their obedience to him and his prescient vision. Recognizing that his work is finally done, Leto allows himself to be assassinated.

Fifteen hundred years later in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; (1984), the Bene Gesserit have regained their power and relocated to a hidden homeworld they call Chapterhouse, and the spice cycle has been renewed on Arrakis, now called Rakis. New opposition arrives in the form of a violent matriarchal order calling themselves the Honored Matres, a ruthless and brutal force who seek domination over the Old Empire and who do not use or rely on melange for their powers. As the Matres all but exterminate the Tleilaxu race and next target the Sisterhood, Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Taraza implements a bold plan to release humanity from the oracular hold of Leto II by goading the Honored Matres into destroying Rakis. Meanwhile, the Bene Gesserit have terraformed Chapterhouse into a desert planet like Rakis and bring a single sandworm there to begin a new spice cycle. In &quot;&quot; (1985), the Honored Matres begin to destroy all of the Bene Gesserit-controlled planets and enslave the populace of the other planets they conquer. The Matres themselves are hunted by a far more powerful force from out in the Scattering. The new Mother Superior Darwi Odrade recognizes that the threat of this unknown enemy is greater than that of the Honored Matres, and forms another bold plan. The captive Honored Matre Murbella, who has been assimilated into the Bene Gesserit and gained the full powers of a Reverend Mother, defeats the leader of the Honored Matres in combat and thus becomes Great Honored Matre. She immediately succeeds Odrade as Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, joining the two forces under a single leader in an uneasy truce that, it is hoped, will be able to defeat the unknown enemy.

===Sequels===
In &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;, the 2006 continuation of the series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, Murbella adopts the new title of Mother Commander and struggles to bring the opposing factions of her New Sisterhood together. Among the Bene Gesserit, some are willing to accept the merger with the Honored Matres, while others oppose allying with their enemies; a group of dissenters led by Reverend Mother Sheeana having fled Chapterhouse aboard a no-ship upon Murbella&#x27;s ascension to leadership. Within the Honored Matres, many admire Murbella&#x27;s strength and abilities and desire Bene Gesserit training, but resist assimilation. Additionally, a number of Honored Matres refuse to acknowledge Murbella as their leader; the largest such rebel group is led by Matre Superior Hellica on Tleilax. As Murbella amasses weapons for the coming battle with the unknown enemy, she trains an elite force of commando troops with the combined battle talents of Bene Gesserit, Honored Matres, and even the Swordmasters of Ginaz. These &quot;Valkyries&quot; are able to effect Hellica&#x27;s defeat, galvanizing many dissenters into finally joining Murbella&#x27;s cause against the unknown enemy, now revealed to be the resurrected thinking machines thought destroyed 15,000 years before. In the 2007 sequel, &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, the thinking machines have unleashed decimating viruses on planet after planet, while Face Dancers infiltrate human civilization in their own insidious plot to take over the universe. The New Sisterhood&#x27;s fleet of warships succumbs to Face Dancer sabotage, but is saved from thinking machine attack by a host of Guild Navigators in heighliners, brought together by the Oracle of Time, Norma Cenva. Thinking machine leader Omnius is wiped out of existence by the Oracle, and the Face Dancer threat eliminated. As Murbella joins Duncan Idaho in his plan to rule a universe in which humanity and thinking machines co-exist, Sheeana introduces sandworms to the former thinking machine planet Synchrony, where she will found an orthodox Sisterhood.

===&quot;Legends of Dune&quot;===
In the &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; prequel trilogy (2002–2004) by Brian Herbert and Anderson it is revealed that the Sorceresses of Rossak, who possess destructive telekinetic powers existing only in women and have a breeding plan to create more powerful telepaths, had been the predecessors of the Bene Gesserit. As a Sorceress is always killed when she unleashes her full power, they sacrifice themselves to destroy some of the Titans and Neo-Cymeks during the Butlerian Jihad, over 10,000 years before the events in &quot;Dune&quot;. Later, they expand their genetic program to preserve human bloodlines when humanity is endangered by a widespread plague called the &quot;Demon Scourge&quot;, genetically engineered and unleashed by the thinking machines. Raquella Berto-Anirul becomes their leader after surviving a poisoning attempt by being the first to internally render the toxin harmless. The ordeal also makes Raquella the first to access Other Memory and use the power of Voice; she later establishes the Bene Gesserit, instituting a similar ritualized poisoning to unlock the same abilities in others.

===&quot;Great Schools of Dune&quot;===
In &quot;Sisterhood of Dune&quot; (2012), 80 years have passed since the end of the Butlerian Jihad, and an aging Raquella remains the only Sister to have survived the Agony. Ambitious young Valya Harkonnen has hopes of using her Bene Gesserit training to complete her family&#x27;s vendetta against Vorian Atreides and his entire bloodline. Valya is one of the Sisters trusted with the records of Raquella&#x27;s breeding program, which are maintained by a secret cache of forbidden computers, concealed in a cave outside the Sisterhood School on Rossak. Raquella&#x27;s granddaughter Dorotea undergoes the Agony and becomes a Reverend Mother, discovering the truth about her parentage and the existence of computers. As a devout anti-technology Butlerian, she assists Emperor Salvador Corrino in his raid on the Rossak school. Salvador has several dozen Sisters executed and disbands the Sisterhood, except for Dorotea&#x27;s Orthodox followers, who return to the Imperial capital on Salusa Secundus to serve as court Truthsayers.

Raquella has reestablished her school on Wallach IX in &quot;Mentats of Dune&quot; (2014), thanks to the help of industrialist Josef Venport. Valya, now a Reverend Mother, retrieves the hidden computers from Rossak and hopes to succeed the declining Raquella as Mother Superior. Raquella believes that the only hope for the Sisterhood to survive is for the Wallach IX sisters to reconcile with Dorotea&#x27;s faction on Salusa Secundus; her health failing, she summons Dorotea to the School and forces Dorotea and Valya to put their differences aside and agree to work together for the good of the Sisterhood. Naming them co-leaders, Raquella dies; Valya however, still bitter about Dorotea&#x27;s betrayal, uses her newly discovered power of Voice to force Dorotea to commit suicide. Valya declares herself to be the sole Mother Superior, and ingratiates herself to the new Emperor, Roderick Corrino.

== Goals, strategies, and ritual ==

===Breeding program===

The ultimate goal of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, up to the end of the novel &quot;Dune&quot;, is the creation of a male Bene Gesserit they call the Kwisatz Haderach (, defined by Herbert as &quot;The Shortening of the Way&quot;, the term comes from the Hebrew mystical term Kefitzat Haderech). They intend to achieve this superbeing through a massive human breeding program, which they have conducted for countless generations; using careful manipulations of relationships and breeding sisters to &quot;collect&quot; key genes, the Bene Gesserit have controlled and finessed bloodlines through the ages. Also called &quot;the one who can be two places simultaneously&quot; or &quot;the one who can be many places at once&quot;, the Kwisatz Haderach, with mental powers that would bridge space and time and access to both male and female lines in Other Memory, will be an overt figure in the Bene Gesserit&#x27;s manipulations and thrust upon the universe as a messiah.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme is, in theory, to have come to full fruition from the union of an Atreides daughter (planned to be born of the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica and the Duke Leto Atreides) and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, nephew of the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (himself secretly the natural father of Lady Jessica). This plan is disrupted when Jessica chooses to conceive an Atreides son rather than the daughter she had been ordered to produce. This son, Paul Atreides, later proves to be the Kwisatz Haderach, born a generation early. Political intrigue results in Paul&#x27;s rise to power as Emperor of the Known Universe, secured by his stranglehold on the melange supply. A decade later, in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, the Bene Gesserit are frustrated to be at the mercy of their own creation, but a conspiracy to remove Paul from power fails. He realizes, however, that while prescience grants knowledge, absolute control of outcomes is not possible due to interference patterns caused by their own actions. Despising the religion that has risen up around him and seeing where it will lead, Paul walks into the desert seeking death in hopes that he can change the course of the future. Paul&#x27;s son Leto II is also a Kwisatz Haderach; seeing the same future, Leto decides to do what his father could not. He takes control of both the empire and the Bene Gesserit breeding program in &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, and begins his own transformation into a human-sandworm hybrid to give himself the time he needs for his Golden Path to be fully realized. Thirty-five hundred years later, his breeding plan produces Siona Atreides, the first in a line of humans who are able to disappear from prescient sight, and Leto allows himself to be assassinated. After 1,500 more years (as chronicled in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; and &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot;), the Bene Gesserit have restored their breeding program. However, they are too terrified of the consequences of producing another Kwisatz Haderach, so instead breed for special individuals of great talent and usefulness in order to amplify certain human characteristics and preserve them. Now aware of Leto&#x27;s Golden Path, the Bene Gesserit widen their goals of advancing humanity and saving it from extinction.

The behind-the-scenes intrigues of the breeding program are illuminated in the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy (1999–2001) as the program nears fruition in the time immediately prior to the novel &quot;Dune&quot;. The origins of the program are explored in the &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; prequel series. Over 10,000 years before the events of &quot;Dune&quot;, the Sorceresses of Rossak had started keeping detailed breeding records circa 400 B.G., trying to improve the potency and prevalence of their telekinetic powers. In 108 B.G., the Sorceresses begin collecting genetic samples of various human bloodlines, which were in jeopardy from a catastrophic virus genetically engineered and unleashed by the thinking machines.

In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007), written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, Duncan Idaho is revealed to be the final Kwisatz Haderach destined to bring together humans and thinking machines. While he is not a product of a breeding program, his multiple rebirths and deaths as a ghola throughout the series had given him the opportunity to gain experience and develop himself as no other human could.

=== Avoiding direct power ===
The Bene Gesserit choose to use indirect methodologies to further their goals, rather than wield overt power themselves. They have noted the Taoist principle that whatever rises must fall; and so rather than taking direct control of the human race, they instead manipulate the social and political order with subtlety and insinuation, often using extraordinarily long-term stratagems spanning generations. The Bene Gesserit avoid appearing too rich or powerful, or revealing the extent of their powers, to prevent being seen as overtly responsible for the rise and fall of governments and empires, and to avoid any organized backlash. To this end, the Bene Gesserit provide some of their trained initiates as wives and concubines, and will train the daughters of noble families for a fee.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, Padishah Emperor of the known universe Shaddam IV keeps the wise but calculating Bene Gesserit Truthsayer Mohiam by his side at all times. The Emperor&#x27;s deceased wife, Anirul, had been a &quot;Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank&quot;, and Herbert notes that every one of their five daughters is Bene Gesserit-trained. In fact, Shaddam is kept without a male heir on specific orders from the Sisterhood, and is bound by an agreement that only a daughter will ascend his throne. The Bene Gesserit had also placed their acolyte Jessica (herself the product of a secret Bene Gesserit liaison with the Baron Harkonnen) as the concubine to Duke Leto Atreides, and married the Bene Gesserit Margot to Shaddam&#x27;s close friend and minion Count Fenring. After Shaddam&#x27;s eldest daughter Princess Irulan is forced into marriage to Paul to secure his claim to the Imperial throne, in &quot;Children of Dune&quot; Irulan&#x27;s loyalty to the Sisterhood gives them false hope that she can help them topple Paul, or at least control his offspring. Later in &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;, Herbert establishes that despite Leto&#x27;s many restrictions on them, the Bene Gesserit still train young noblewomen for a price. In fact, when Leto meets Hwi Noree, the Ixian ambassador obviously bred and trained to charm him, he realizes &quot;that part of her education had been conducted by the Bene Gesserit. She had their way of controlling her responses, of sensing the undertones in a conversation. He could see, however, that the Bene Gesserit overlay had been a delicate thing, never penetrating the basic sweetness of her nature.&quot;

=== Missionaria Protectiva ===

The Bene Gesserit practice &quot;religious engineering&quot; through the Missionaria Protectiva, which spreads &quot;infectious superstitions on primitive worlds, thus opening those regions to exploitation by the Bene Gesserit&quot;. Collectively known as Panoplia Prophetica, these myths, prophecies, and superstitions provide the opportunity for a Bene Gesserit to later cast herself as a guide, protector, or some other figure in fulfillment of a prophecy in order to manipulate the religious subjects for protection or other purposes. These myths also exploit religion as a powerful force in human society; by controlling the particulars of religion, the Bene Gesserit have a manipulative lever on society in general. The Bene Gesserit also employ the Missionaria Protectiva to prepare the Empire for its Kwisatz Haderach.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, Jessica and Paul take refuge among the Fremen after the attack on House Atreides. With his mother&#x27;s guidance, Paul is able to make use of the planted myths by claiming to be the &quot;mahdi&quot;, a messianic figure from legendary material planted among the Fremen by the Missionaria Protectiva. That the mahdi legend has been planted on Dune indicates to Jessica that conditions on Dune are truly awful, since this legend is reserved for only the harshest environments where a Bene Gesserit would need the maximum advantage over surrounding influences. Paul&#x27;s meteoric rise to power is greatly facilitated by his association with the mahdi legend. Later, in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, the Bene Gesserit plan to use Reverend Mother Sheeana&#x27;s ability to control the great sandworms to build her into a religious figure around whom they can fashion a mass devoted following, uniting many factions in the universe under the Bene Gesserit and against the forces of the Scattering.

===Spice agony===
The spice agony is an ordeal in which an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit takes a poisonous &quot;awareness spectrum&quot; narcotic and, by internally changing the substance and neutralizing its toxicity, gains access to Other Memory, the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Lady Jessica notes that the ritual originated with the &quot;discovery of the poison drug on Rossak&quot;, although by her time, the Rossak drug has long since been replaced by melange. On Arrakis, the Fremen Reverend Mothers use a poison called Water of Life, which is the exhalation of a drowning &quot;little maker&quot; (small sandworm) in water. In the Fremen version of the rite, after the ordeal the Reverend Mother also provides the changed poison for the sietch orgy.

An acolyte unable to effect this change dies. Only women have ever survived the agony, but through their breeding program the Bene Gesserit seek the male Kwisatz Haderach who will be able to change an illuminating poison. The Bene Gesserit try over many generations through selective breeding to produce such a being. A Kwisatz Haderach is given abilities different from those of a Reverend Mother. During the spice agony, there are two areas of the soul that the acolyte may visit — the part that gives, and the part that takes; a Reverend Mother cannot access the memories of her male ancestors, and is terrified by the psychic space within her that the masculine memories inhabit. Until Paul Atreides, all men who had attempted the spice agony had died.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, Jessica endures the agony while pregnant with her daughter, Alia. This has a profound effect on the unborn Alia, who is consequently born a full Reverend Mother with the complete Other Memory of both her female and male ancestors. The Bene Gesserit refer to children born this way as &quot;Abominations&quot;. Without the benefit of a fully formed adult ego of her own, Alia is susceptible to the influence of her ancestral memories. This ultimately leads to her downfall, as she is eventually possessed by the persona of her evil grandfather Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whom she herself had murdered as a child in the events of &quot;Dune&quot;.

The origin of the ritual is explained in the prequel novel &quot;&quot; (2004) when Raquella Berto-Anirul is poisoned by Rossak Sorceress Ticia Cenva with the Rossak drug. Raquella manages to internally convert the poison into a harmless substance and is thus the first to experience the awakening of Other Memory. Raquella later establishes the Bene Gesserit, presumably perfecting the technique and training others to survive the ordeal.

== Powers ==

=== Other Memory === 
One of the &#x27;powers&#x27; of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother is her Other Memory: the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors, passed on through genetic memory, and thus, up to the point where each following ancestor was born and the physical contact with the mother broken. The ego/memory combination remains a distinct identity within the Reverend Mother&#x27;s mind, and is able to inject itself into her awareness at appropriate or emotional moments, though the Reverend Mother&#x27;s ego is always dominant. The prequel novel &quot;Dune: The Battle of Corrin&quot; by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson establishes that the first Bene Gesserit to access Other Memory had been Raquella Berto-Anirul, the founder of the order.

A Reverend Mother has access only to her female lineage in Other Memory; her male line is unavailable to her, present as a dark void that terrifies her. Until the time of &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;, the purpose of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme is to breed a Kwisatz Haderach, a male with Other Memory who can see both lines, male and female. Male memory will be complete until moment of conception, when physical contact with the father is lost.

Reverend Mothers may also pass their own ego/memory combination to other Reverend Mothers at will, merely by touching foreheads. When a Reverend Mother dies in the presence of another Reverend Mother, the second will accept the ego/memory of the first to prevent the loss of the dying Reverend Mother&#x27;s experience and ancestral memories. Especially when the Mother Superior perishes, it is important to take her ego/memory so that her plans and strategies may continue uninterrupted. This is first explored in &quot;Dune&quot;, when Jessica accepts the life experience of the dying Fremen Reverend Mother Ramallo. In &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot;, Darwi Odrade is Mother Superior, a contentious choice ratified by the fact that she was present at the previous Mother Superior&#x27;s death, and has her in Other Memory; she represents the most continuous line of leadership. Under extreme conditions, a large community of Bene Gesserit will practice &quot;Extremis Progressiva&quot;, a mass sharing of ego/memories with each other to spread all the ego/memories amongst everyone; thus, if one survives, they all survive. In &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot;, the Bene Gesserit school on Lampadas, under attack by the Honored Matres, undertakes &quot;Extremis Progressiva&quot;; Lucilla escapes with the &quot;Lampadas Horde&quot;, hoping to return to the Bene Gesserit with them.

Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert&#x27;s son and biographer, explains that the concept of Other Memory is &quot;largely based upon the writings and teachings of Carl Gustav Jung, who spoke of a &#x27;collective unconscious&#x27;, that supposedly inborn set of &#x27;contents and modes of behavior&#x27; possessed by all human beings&quot;. Frank Herbert was introduced to Jung&#x27;s work by two Jungian psychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, and Jung&#x27;s teachings ultimately had &quot;a profound and continuing influence on [Herbert&#x27;s] work&quot;.

===The Voice===

Bene Gesserit are trained in what they call &quot;the Voice&quot; a means &quot;to control others merely by selected tone shadings of the voice&quot;. By modulating the subtleties of her voice, a Bene Gesserit can issue commands on a subconscious level, compelling obedience in others that they cannot resist, whether they are consciously aware of the attempt or not. This control can be as subtle as influencing thoughts and motivations, or as strong as forcing physical actions and even temporary paralysis in the subject. The Voice may also be subtly employed in any manner of conversation, public speaking, or debate to help soothe, convince, persuade, influence, or otherwise enhance the effect of the words being spoken. To affect this, the Bene Gesserit must &quot;register&quot; the intended target by analyzing his or her personality and vocal patterns through observation or seemingly innocuous direct questions.

Training in the Voice is independent of the Reverend Mother ritual, so people outside the order may be instructed in its use. Before the events of &quot;Dune&quot;, Jessica has begun teaching it to Paul; after the Reverend Mother Mohiam tests him in the novel, she urges Jessica to &quot;ignore the regular order of training. His own safety requires the Voice. He already has a good start in it, but we both know how much more he needs...and that desperately.&quot; Jessica herself later notes of Paul&#x27;s novice attempt: &quot;The tone, the timbre excellent – imperative, very sharp. A slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it could still fall within this man&#x27;s spectrum.&quot;

The Voice is useless against targets who cannot hear the speaker; both Baron Harkonnen in &quot;Dune&quot; and House Corrino in &quot;Children of Dune&quot; employ deaf people to guard Jessica, knowing that she cannot control them via the Voice. Being a manipulation of the target&#x27;s subconscious mind, the Voice is of limited utility against an extremely disciplined mind, such as a Reverend Mother or a strong Mentat; if the target understands what the Voice is and how it works, and is aware that it is being used, he may resist it. One trained in the use of the Voice may easily detect its use by others, even subtly. In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Paul trains some guards to resist the Voice so that he may imprison Bene Gesserit. By the time of &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Gurney Halleck has also been trained by Jessica to resist the Voice completely.

In &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, Reverend Mother Odrade explains to Sheeana that planetary populations exposed to long-term Voice control learn ways to adapt to it, and can no longer be manipulated. This is why the Honored Matres have been driven back into the Old Empire; over-controlling, they have built up both resistance and rebellion, and are now on the run from their former subjects.

The prequel &quot;Dune: The Battle of Corrin&quot; establishes that the first Bene Gesserit to use the Voice is Raquella Berto-Anirul, the founder of the order. The continuity of the TV series &quot;&quot; depicts the Voice as the invention of Raquella&#x27;s protégée, Valya Harkonnen.

=== Acute observation and Truthsay ===

Bene Gesserit are trained in &quot;the minutiae of observation&quot;, noticing details that the common person would miss in the people and environment around them. When combined with their analytical abilities, this &quot;hyperawareness&quot; enables the Bene Gesserit to divine secrets and arrive at conclusions that are invisible to everyone else. Slight differences in air currents or the design of a room might allow a Bene Gesserit to detect hidden portals and spyholes; minute variations in a person&#x27;s vocal inflection and body language allow a Bene Gesserit to deeply understand a person&#x27;s emotional state, and manipulate it. Knowing that any schooling impresses a particular pattern in its students, they are able to use these clues to predict and anticipate actions. The Bene Gesserit can easily determine a person&#x27;s origins and root language by analyzing their speech patterns, cadence, and pacing, as Jessica does when she realizes that a visiting Spacing Guild banker is a Harkonnen agent.

Bene Gesserit specifically trained as Truthsayers are able to determine whether someone is lying by analyzing their speech, body language, and physical signs like pulse and heart rate. In principle, all humans have such perception, but extensive training is required to develop this latent talent to the point of great usefulness. Truthsayers are used widely in politics and trade; the Padishah Emperors are never without one. Combined with the Voice, Truthsay is also useful for interrogation and torture.

=== Simulflow ===
Bene Gesserit also practice &quot;simulflow&quot;, the flow of several threads of consciousness at once—mental multitasking, as it were. The combination of simulflow with their analytical abilities and Other Memory are responsible for the frightening intelligence of the average Bene Gesserit, though this ability is less powerful than the analytical abilities of a Mentat. This simulflow can also be held with Other Memory; Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade practiced both forms in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;.

=== &quot;Prana-bindu&quot; training and the &quot;weirding way&quot; ===
The Bene Gesserit develop their physical abilities as well as their mental abilities. A trained Sister has full control over each muscle in her body through training known as prana-bindu. This allows her to bend the last joint in her little toe while remaining otherwise motionless, bend and contort her body in ways that most would consider impossible, or put a remarkable amount of force behind a physical blow. The mental part of &quot;prana-bindu&quot;, or &quot;prana-nervature&quot; (&quot;prana&quot; stands for breath, &quot;bindu&quot; stands for musculature) is the precise control of the totality of nerves in the human body. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Reverend Mother Mohiam tests Paul with a nerve induction device (&quot;the box&quot;) that causes the sensation of intense pain. Paul learns that he is not the only one to have tried it, but is perhaps specially resistant; this conversation points to a widespread use of it as a tool among the Bene Gesserit to measure self control, nerve control, and as Mohiam puts it, crisis and observation.

Unarmed attacks are part of a specialized Bene Gesserit martial art which incorporates the &quot;prana-bindu&quot; methods of optimized muscle control. These enable one to deliver powerful blows and to move with extreme precision and speed. The basic principle behind it is that, as Farad&#x27;n of House Corrino says, &quot;My mind affects my reality.&quot; A practitioner of the art has to know that the action he or she &quot;wants&quot; to perform has already been performed. For example, to imagine oneself behind an opponent at the current moment in time; when trained well, this knowledge will place you at the spot desired. To anyone witnessing, it almost appears as though the combatant has teleported.

The Fremen refer to this fighting ability as the &quot;weirding way&quot;. In &quot;Dune&quot;, the Fremen use the word &quot;weirding&quot; instead of &quot;Bene Gesserit&quot;, calling Jessica a &quot;weirding woman&quot; and noting &quot;he has the weirding voice&quot; when Paul wields this power.

=== Internal organic-chemical control ===
Just as the &quot;prana-bindu&quot; allows the Bene Gesserit to precisely control each muscle and nerve, they also have complete conscious control over the functions of their internal organs and body chemistry. A Sister can completely control her breathing and heart rate to the degree that she can appear dead to most tests even after intense physical exertion. They can control their need for food and water to the extremes of hunger and thirst, and even commit suicide at will by simply stopping their hearts or shutting down their brains. The Bene Gesserit are therefore immune to poisons, as they can simply change the chemical makeup of any harmful substance in their body and render it harmless. It is hinted that should a Bene Gesserit wish to, she could slow her aging process dramatically, controlling every aspect of her metabolism. It is suggested that a Sister would never attempt this, as it might call attention to the Sisterhood and reveal too much of their abilities. In &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Jessica realizes that her daughter Alia has done this, which is her first sign that her daughter is sinking into Abomination.

One of the most significant biological abilities of the Bene Gesserit is their control of their own menstrual cycles, and their ability to control (at conception) their child&#x27;s sex. Jessica was ordered to bear only daughters to the Atreides, but defied her Bene Gesserit sisters (out of her love for the Duke) and had a son, Paul Atreides. The Bene Gesserit conspired against the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV&#x27;s desire to have a male heir and instructed his Bene Gesserit wife to give him only daughters, such as Princess Irulan.

=== Sexual talents ===
The Bene Gesserit are notable for their extensive skill in seduction, sex and sexual imprinting. The most talented and most highly trained are known as Imprinters. Men in a position of power or future power, or those with specific qualities that the order wishes to incorporate into their breeding program, are typical targets of a Bene Gesserit imprinter. Men seduced by an imprinter are permanently affected (imprinted) by the intense sexual experience and are thereafter consciously or subconsciously favorable to the Sisterhood. An imprinter can be successfully resisted if the subject has been psychologically pre-conditioned to do so, and the subject&#x27;s automatic defensive response may even be entirely subconscious.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, Lady Fenring is instructed by the Bene Gesserit to seduce Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen in order to &quot;preserve the bloodline&quot; by retrieving his genetic material through conception. She also intends to &quot;plant deep in his deepest self the necessary prana-bindu phrases to bend him&quot;, which she later refers to as the &quot;Hypno- of that Feyd-Rautha&#x27;s psyche&quot;. When Paul later fights Feyd to the death, Jessica advises her son to temporarily stun him using the word-sound &quot;Uroshnor&quot;, typically implanted in a dangerous person who has been prepared by the Bene Gesserit. Paul, however, refuses to use this advantage.

In &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, Reverend Mother and Imprinter Lucilla is charged with the seduction-imprinting of the Duncan Idaho ghola so that the Sisterhood may assert some control over him; he ultimately avoids her. Lucilla also mentions the hundreds of sexual positions and variations she knows. In &quot;Heretics&quot;, the Honored Matres have themselves refined this ability to such an intense level that the targeted male becomes completely enslaved. The captured Honored Matre Murbella attempts this on Duncan; his own imprinting ability, secretly conditioned into him by his Tleilaxu creators, suddenly manifests itself. Murbella and Duncan imprint each other, neither having complete control over the other. In &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot; the order has learned the Honored Matre method from Murbella and use it for their own purposes, specifically to awaken the memories within the Miles Teg ghola.

==Weaknesses==

===Addiction to melange===
Reverend Mothers are dependent on melange to give them their abilities. Any person who consumes melange regularly becomes addicted to it and requires it for survival; however, one who has gone through the agony has a far greater need. Though the effects of melange are highly favorable, including vastly increased lifespan and mental powers, withdrawal results in death. Melange is expensive and thus is a continual drain on the Sisterhood&#x27;s wealth; the most significant threat to the Bene Gesserit is the potential loss of their supply. Paul Atreides and then his son Leto II assert control over the Bene Gesserit and keep them in check by grasping control of the planet Arrakis and the spice supply in a show of hydraulic despotism.

===Abomination===

A Bene Gesserit who survives the ritual spice agony gains access to Other Memory, the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors. An adult Reverend Mother can manage the presence of these subordinate inner voices because she has a full personality of her own and a solid sense of self. However, if a Bene Gesserit undergoes the agony while pregnant, the fetus will also experience it, acquiring full consciousness and access to Other Memory. Since the child has not yet developed a sufficiently strong ego before being exposed to her tide of ancestors, she is more susceptible to their influence, and there is a danger that she will ultimately be overcome and possessed by a strong ancestral ego. The Bene Gesserit call this &quot;Abomination&quot;, and such children are killed immediately. They are also referred to as &quot;pre-born&quot; in &quot;Children of Dune&quot;.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, Lady Jessica is pregnant when she undergoes the spice agony while among the Fremen; her resulting daughter, Alia, is born a full Reverend Mother, the mind of an adult in a child&#x27;s body. She pretends to be a child, but others notice that she is different. The Bene Gesserit are eventually outraged and horrified by Alia&#x27;s existence, but she is out of their control. Mohiam says, &quot;I&#x27;ve said too much, but the fact remains that this child who is not a child must be destroyed. Long were we warned against such a one and how to prevent such a birth, but one of our own has betrayed us.&quot; In &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, an adult Alia eventually succumbs to the ancestral ego of her grandfather, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who wants nothing more than the destruction of the Atreides, and is given another opportunity, from the inside, to realize it.

Paul Atreides and Chani&#x27;s twins, Leto II and Ghanima, are also pre-born, but before they become possessed, they stumble across solutions: Leto, forced to undergo a radical spice agony, constructs an executive of benevolent ancestral egos (such as Paul and Paul&#x27;s father Leto I) who protect him; Ghanima, as part of their plan to fake Leto&#x27;s death, consciously blocks the memory of Leto and their plan, inadvertently developing a mental discipline capable of protecting her undeveloped ego. She also uses the ego of her mother, Chani, as a &quot;door guard&quot; of her alter egos, only &quot;peeking behind the door&quot; when she needs advice from Other Memory.

== Litany against fear ==
The litany against fear is an incantation used by the Bene Gesserit throughout the series to focus their minds and calm themselves in times of peril. The litany is as follows:

Lady Jessica teaches it to her son Paul, who uses it in &quot;Dune&quot; when faced with Mohiam&#x27;s test of his ability to withstand excruciating pain. The litany is shortened in David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film.

== Analysis ==
&quot; &quot; is Latin for &quot;he/she shall have behaved well.&quot;

Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert&#x27;s son and biographer, said of his father&#x27;s creation of the Bene Gesserit:
In &quot;Mycelium Running&quot;, mycologist Paul Stamets argues that Herbert was influenced by tales of María Sabina and the sacred mushroom cults of Mexico in creating the Bene Gesserit.

In &quot;Dreamer of Dune&quot;, Brian Herbert&#x27;s 2003 biography of his father, the younger Herbert speculates that the name &quot;Gesserit&quot; is supposed to suggest to the reader the word &quot;Jesuit&quot; and thus evoke undertones of a religious order.

==In adaptations==
The Bene Gesserit appear in all of the &quot;Dune&quot; adaptations to date: the 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;; the 2000 TV miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;; and its 2003 sequel, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;; as well as the 2021 feature film &quot;Dune&quot;, and its 2024 sequel, &quot;&quot;.

A prequel series called &quot;&quot;, centered on the Bene Gesserit, premiered on Max on November 17, 2024. Showrunner Alison Schapker said, &quot;We certainly don&#x27;t want to take away [the Bene Gesserit&#x27;s] mystique, but we do go behind their closed doors and kind of see how they operate&quot;.

<text>Emo () is a music genre characterized by emotional, often confessional lyrics. It emerged as a style of hardcore punk and from the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene, where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore. The bands Rites of Spring and Embrace, among others, pioneered the genre. In the early-to-mid 1990s, emo was adopted and reinvented by alternative rock, indie rock, punk rock, and pop-punk bands, including Sunny Day Real Estate, Jawbreaker, Cap&#x27;n Jazz, and Jimmy Eat World. By the Braid, the Promise Ring, and the Get Up Kids emerged from Midwest emo, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre. Meanwhile, screamo, a more aggressive style of emo using screamed vocals, also emerged, pioneered by the San Diego bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow. Screamo achieved mainstream success in the 2000s with bands like Hawthorne Heights, Silverstein, Story of the Year, Thursday, the Used, and Underoath.

Often seen as a subculture, emo also signifies a specific relationship between fans and artists and certain aspects of fashion, culture, and behavior. Emo fashion includes skinny jeans, black eyeliner, tight s with band names, studded belts, and flat, straight, jet-black hair with long bangs. Since the early-to-mid 2000s, fans of emo music who dress like this are referred to as &quot;emo kids&quot; or &quot;emos&quot;. The emo subculture was stereotypically associated with social alienation, sensitivity, misanthropy, introversion, and angst. Purported links to depression, , and suicide, combined with its rise in popularity in the early 2000s, inspired a backlash against emo, with some bands, including My Chemical Romance and Panic! at the Disco, rejecting the emo label because of the social stigma and controversy surrounding it.

Emo and its subgenre emo pop entered mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional, and many artists signed contracts with major record labels. Bands such as My Chemical Romance, AFI, Fall Out Boy, and The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus continued the genre&#x27;s popularity during the rest of the decade. By the early 2010s, emo&#x27;s popularity had declined, with some emo bands changing their sound and others disbanding. Meanwhile, however, a mainly underground emo revival emerged, with bands such as the World Is a Beautiful Place &amp; I Am No Longer Afraid to Die and Modern Baseball, some drawing on the sound and aesthetic of 1990s emo. During the late 2010s, a fusion genre called emo rap became mainstream; its most famous artists included Lil Peep, XXXTentacion, and Juice Wrld.

==Characteristics==
Emo originated in hardcore punk and is considered a form of Nonetheless, emo has also been considered a genre of alternative rock, indie rock, punk rock, and pop punk. Emo uses the guitar dynamics that use both the softness and loudness of punk rock music. Some emo leans uses characteristics of progressive music with the genre&#x27;s use of complex guitar work, unorthodox song structures, and extreme dynamic shifts.

Lyrics, a focus in emo music, are typically emotional and often personal or confessional, dealing with topics such as failed romance, self-loathing, pain, insecurity, suicidal thoughts, love, and relationships. AllMusic described emo lyrics as &quot;usually either poetry or intimate confessionals&quot;. Early emo bands were hardcore punk bands that used melody and emotional or introspective lyrics and that were less structured than regular hardcore punk, making early emo bands different from the aggression, anger, and structures of regular hardcore punk.

According to AllMusic, most 1990s emo bands &quot;borrowed from some combination of Fugazi, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Weezer&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described emo as &quot;emotional punk or or That is, punk that wears its heart on its sleeve and tries a little tenderness to leaven its sonic attack. If it helps, imagine Ricky Nelson singing in the Sex Pistols.&quot; Author Matt Diehl called emo a &quot;more sensitive interpolation of punk&#x27;s mission&quot;. According to Merriam-Webster, emo is &quot;a style of rock music influenced by punk rock and featuring introspective and emotionally fraught lyrics&quot;.

==History==

===Predecessors===
&quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, the Beach Boys&#x27; 1966 album, is sometimes considered the first emo album. According to music writer Luke Britton, such assertions are perhaps stated &quot;wryly&quot;, and wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s generally accepted that the genre&#x27;s pioneers&quot; came later in the 1980s. During the decade, many hardcore punk and post-hardcore bands formed in Washington, D.C. Post-hardcore, an experimental offshoot of hardcore punk, was inspired by . Hardcore punk bands and post-hardcore bands who influenced early emo bands include Minor Threat, Black Flag and Hüsker Dü.

===1984–1991: Origins===


Emo, which began as a post-hardcore subgenre, was part of the 1980s hardcore punk scene in Washington, D.C. as something different from the violent part of the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene. Minor Threat fan Guy Picciotto formed Rites of Spring in 1984, using the musical style of hardcore punk and combining the musical style with melodic guitars, varied rhythms, and personal, emotional lyrics. Many of the band&#x27;s themes, including nostalgia, romantic bitterness and poetic desperation, became familiar tropes of later emo music. Its performances were public, emotional purges where audience members sometimes wept. Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat became a Rites of Spring fan (recording their only album and being their roadie) and formed the emo band Embrace, which explored similar themes of self-searching and emotional release. Similar bands followed in connection with the &quot;Revolution Summer” of 1985, an attempt by members of the Washington scene to break from the usual characteristics of hardcore punk to a hardcore punk style with different characteristics. Bands such as Gray Matter, Beefeater, Fire Party, Dag Nasty, and Soulside were associated with the movement.

Although the origins of the word &quot;emo&quot; are uncertain, evidence shows that the word &quot;emo&quot; was coined in the mid-1980s, specifically 1985. According to Andy Greenwald, author of &quot;Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo&quot;, &quot;The origins of the term &#x27;emo&#x27; are shrouded in mystery ... but it first came into common practice in 1985. If Minor Threat was hardcore, then Rites of Spring, with its altered focus, was emotional hardcore or emocore.&quot; Michael Azerrad, author of &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot;, also traces the word&#x27;s origins to the mid-1980s: &quot;The style was soon dubbed &#x27;emo-core,&#x27; a term everyone involved bitterly detested&quot;. MacKaye traces it to 1985, attributing it to an article in &quot;Thrasher&quot; magazine referring to Embrace and other Washington, D.C. bands as &quot;emo-core&quot; (which he called &quot;the stupidest fucking thing I&#x27;ve ever heard in my entire life&quot;). Other accounts attribute the word to an audience member at an Embrace show, who shouted as an insult that the band was &quot;emocore&quot;. Others have said that MacKaye coined the word when he used it self-mockingly in a magazine, or that it originated with Rites of Spring. The &quot;emocore&quot; label quickly spread through the DC punk scene, and was associated with many bands associated with Ian MacKaye&#x27;s Dischord Records. Although many of the bands rejected the term, it stayed. Jenny Toomey recalled, &quot;The only people who used it at first were the ones that were jealous over how big and fanatical a scene it was. [Rites of Spring] existed well before the term did and they hated it. But there was this weird moment, like when people started calling music &#x27;grunge,&#x27; where you were using the term even though you hated it.&quot; The Washington, D.C. emo scene lasted only a few years, and by 1986, most of emo&#x27;s major bands (including Rites of Spring, Embrace, Gray Matter and Beefeater) had broken up. However, its ideas and aesthetics spread quickly across the country through a network of homemade zines, vinyl records and hearsay. According to Greenwald, the Washington, D.C. scene laid the groundwork for emo&#x27;s subsequent incarnations:

===1991–1994: Reinvention===
As the Washington, D.C. emo movement spread across the United States, local bands began to emulate its style. Emo combined the fatalism, theatricality and isolation of The Smiths with hardcore punk&#x27;s uncompromising, dramatic worldview. Despite the number of bands and the variety of locales, emocore&#x27;s late-1980s aesthetics remained more-or-less the same: &quot;over-the-top lyrics about feelings wedded to dramatic but decidedly punk music.&quot; During the early–mid 1990s, several new bands reinvented emo, making emo expand by becoming a subgenre of genres like indie rock and pop punk. Chief among them were Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate, who inspired cult followings, redefined emo and brought it a step closer to the mainstream. In the wake of the 1991 success of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot;, underground music and subcultures were widely noticed in the United States. New distribution networks emerged, touring routes were codified, and regional and independent acts accessed the national stage. Young people across the country became fans of independent music, and punk culture became mainstream.


Emerging from the late 1980s and early 1990s San Francisco punk rock scene and forming in New York City, Jawbreaker combined pop punk with emotional and personal lyrics. Singer-guitarist Blake Schwarzenbach focused his lyrics on personal, immediate topics often taken from his journal. Often obscure and cloaked in metaphors, their relationship to Schwarzenbach&#x27;s concerns gave his words a bitterness and frustration which made them universal and attractive to audiences. Schwarzenbach became emo&#x27;s first idol, as listeners related to the singer even more than to his songs. Jawbreaker&#x27;s 1994 album, &quot;24 Hour Revenge Therapy&quot;, was popular with fans and is a touchstone of mid-1990s emo. Although Jawbreaker signed with Geffen Records and toured with mainstream bands Nirvana and Green Day, Jawbreaker&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Dear You&quot; did not achieve mainstream success. Jawbreaker broke up soon afterwards, with Schwarzenbach forming emo band Jets to Brazil.

Sunny Day Real Estate formed in Seattle at the height of the early 1990s grunge boom. The music video for &quot;Seven&quot;, lead track of the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Diary&quot; (1994), was played on MTV, giving the band more attention. Another band often considered to be emo which emerged at the same time was California&#x27;s Weezer. Nonetheless, it is debated whether Weezer is emo. For example, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; argues that the emo label has been misapplied to the band, and author Andy Greenwald also states that the band is not emo. Jimmy Eat World, an Arizona emo band, also emerged at this time. Influenced by bands such as the Mr. T Experience and Horace Pinker, Jimmy Eat World released its self-titled debut album in 1994.

===1994–1997: Underground popularity===
The American punk and indie rock movements, which had been largely underground since the early 1980s, became part of mainstream culture during the mid-1990s. With Nirvana&#x27;s success, major record labels capitalized on the popularity of alternative rock and other underground music by signing and promoting independent bands. In 1994, the same year that Jawbreaker&#x27;s &quot;24 Hour Revenge Therapy&quot; and Sunny Day Real Estate&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot; were released, punk rock bands Green Day and the Offspring broke into the mainstream with diamond album &quot;Dookie&quot; and multi-platinum album &quot;Smash&quot;, respectively. After underground music went mainstream, emo retreated and reformed as a national subculture over the next few years. Inspired by Jawbreaker, Drive Like Jehu and Fugazi, 1990s emo abandoned the elements of hardcore punk and used elements of indie rock, with punk rock&#x27;s do-it-yourself work ethic but smoother songs and emotional vocals.

Many 1990s emo bands, such as Cap&#x27;n Jazz, Braid, Christie Front Drive, Mineral, Jimmy Eat World, the Get Up Kids and the Promise Ring, originated in the central U.S. Many of the bands had a distinct vocal style and guitar melodies, which was later called Midwest emo. According to Andy Greenwald, &quot;this was the period when emo earned many, if not all, of the stereotypes that have lasted to this day: boy-driven, glasses-wearing, overly sensitive, overly brainy, chiming-guitar-driven college music.&quot; Emo band Texas Is the Reason bridged the gap between indie rock and emo in their three-year lifespan on the East Coast, melding Sunny Day Real Estate&#x27;s melodies and punk musicianship and singing directly to the listener. In New Jersey, the band Lifetime played shows in fans&#x27; basements. Lifetime&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;Hello Bastards&quot; on Jade Tree Records, fused hardcore punk with emo and eschewed cynicism and irony in favor of love songs. The album sold tens of thousands of copies, and Lifetime paved the way for New Jersey and Long Island emo bands Brand New, Midtown, The Movielife, My Chemical Romance, Saves the Day, Senses Fail, Taking Back Sunday and Thursday.

The Promise Ring&#x27;s music took a slower, smoother, pop punk approach to riffs, blending them with singer Davey von Bohlen&#x27;s imagist lyrics delivered in a froggy croon and pronounced lisp and playing shows in basements and VFW halls. Jade Tree released their debut album, &quot;30° Everywhere&quot;, in 1996; it sold tens of thousands of copies and was successful by independent standards. Greenwald describes the album as &quot;like being hit in the head with cotton candy.&quot; Other bands, such as Karate, the Van Pelt, Joan of Arc and the Shyness Clinic, played emo music with post-rock and noise rock influences. Their common lyrical thread was &quot;applying big questions to small scenarios.&quot; A cornerstone of mid-1990s emo was Weezer&#x27;s 1996 album, &quot;Pinkerton&quot;. After the mainstream success of Weezer&#x27;s self-titled debut album, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; showed a more dark and abrasive style. Frontman Rivers Cuomo&#x27;s songs focused on messy, manipulative sex and his insecurity about dealing with celebrity. A critical and commercial failure, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it the third-worst album of the year. Cuomo retreated from the public eye, later referring to the album as &quot;hideous&quot; and &quot;a hugely painful mistake&quot;. However, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; found enduring appeal with young people who were discovering alternative rock and identified with its confessional lyrics and theme of rejection. Sales grew steadily due to word of mouth, online message boards and Napster. &quot;Although no one was paying attention&quot;, writes Greenwald, &quot;perhaps &quot;because&quot; no one was paying attention—&quot;Pinkerton&quot; became the most important emo album of the decade.&quot; In 2004, James Montgomery of MTV described Weezer as &quot;the most important band of the last 10 years&quot;. &quot;Pinkerton&quot; success grew very gradually, being certified gold by the RIAA in July 2001 and eventually being certified platinum by the RIAA in September 2016.

Mid-1990s emo was embodied by Mineral, whose &quot;The Power of Failing&quot; (1997) and &quot;EndSerenading&quot; (1998) encapsulated emo tropes: somber music, accompanied by a shy narrator singing seriously about mundane problems. Greenwald calls &quot;If I Could&quot; &quot;the ultimate expression&quot; of 1990s emo, writing that &quot;the song&#x27;s short synopsis—she is beautiful, I am weak, dumb, and shy; I am alone but am surprisingly poetic when left alone — sums up everything that emo&#x27;s adherents admired and its detractors detested.&quot; Another significant band was Braid, whose 1998 album &quot;Frame and Canvas&quot; and B-side song &quot;Forever Got Shorter&quot; blurred the line between band and listener; the group mirrored their audience in passion and sentiment, and sang in their fans&#x27; voice.

Although mid-1990s emo had thousands of young fans, it did not enter the national consciousness. A few bands were offered contracts with major record labels, but most broke up before they could capitalize on the opportunity. Jimmy Eat World signed to Capitol Records in 1995 and developed a following with their album, &quot;Static Prevails&quot;, but did not break into the mainstream yet. The Promise Ring were the most commercially successful emo band of the time, with sales of their 1997 album &quot;Nothing Feels Good&quot; reaching the mid-five figures. Greenwald calls the album &quot;the pinnacle of its generation of emo: a convergence of pop and punk, of resignation and celebration, of the lure of girlfriends and the pull of friends, bandmates, and the road&quot;; mid-1990s emo was &quot;the last subculture made of vinyl and paper instead of plastic and megabytes.&quot;

===1997–2002: Independent success===

Emo&#x27;s popularity grew during the late 1990s, laying the foundation for mainstream success. Deep Elm Records released a series of eleven compilation albums, &quot;The Emo Diaries&quot;, from 1997 to 2007. Emphasizing unreleased music from many bands, the series included Jimmy Eat World, Further Seems Forever, Samiam and the Movielife. Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s 1999 album, &quot;Clarity&quot;, was a touchstone for later emo bands. In 2003, Andy Greenwald called &quot;Clarity&quot; &quot;one of the most fiercely beloved rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll records of the last decade.&quot; Despite a warm critical reception and the promotion of &quot;Lucky Denver Mint&quot; in the Drew Barrymore comedy &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;, &quot;Clarity&quot; was commercially unsuccessful. Nevertheless, the album had steady word-of-mouth popularity and eventually sold over 70,000 copies. Jimmy Eat World self-financed their next album, &quot;Bleed American&quot; (2001), before signing with DreamWorks Records. The album sold 30,000 copies in its first week, went gold shortly afterwards and went platinum in 2002, making emo become mainstream. Drive-Thru Records developed a roster of primarily pop punk bands with emo characteristics, including Midtown, the Starting Line, the Movielife and Something Corporate. Drive-Thru&#x27;s partnership with MCA Records enabled its brand of emo-inflected pop to reach a wider audience. Drive-Thru&#x27;s unabashedly populist, capitalist approach to music allowed its bands&#x27; albums and merchandise to sell in stores such as Hot Topic.

Independent label Vagrant Records signed several successful late-1990s and early-2000s emo bands. The Get Up Kids had sold over 15,000 copies of their debut album, &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; (1997), before signing with Vagrant. The label promoted them aggressively, sending them on tours opening for Green Day and Weezer. Their 1999 album, &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot;, reaching number 31 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart. Vagrant signed and recorded a number of other emo-related bands over the next two years, including the Anniversary, Reggie and the Full Effect, the New Amsterdams, Alkaline Trio, Saves the Day, Dashboard Confessional, Hey Mercedes and Hot Rod Circuit. Saves the Day had developed a substantial East Coast following and sold almost 50,000 copies of their second album, &quot;Through Being Cool&quot; (1999), before signing with Vagrant and releasing &quot;Stay What You Are&quot; (2001). &quot;Stay What You Are&quot; sold 15,000 copies in its first week, reached number 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold at least 120,000 copies in the United States. Vagrant organized a national tour with every band on its label, sponsored by corporations including Microsoft and Coca-Cola, during the summer of 2001. Its populist approach and use of the internet as a marketing tool made it one of the country&#x27;s most-successful independent labels and helped popularize the word &quot;emo&quot;. According to Greenwald, &quot;More than any other event, it was Vagrant America that defined emo to masses—mainly because it had the gumption to hit the road and bring it to &quot;them&quot;.&quot;

===2002–2010: Mainstream success===


Emo broke into the mainstream media during the summer of 2002. During this time, many fans of emo music had an appearance of short, dyed black hair with bangs cut high on the forehead, glasses with thick and black frames, and thrift store clothes. This fashion then became a huge part of emo&#x27;s identity. Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s &quot;Bleed American&quot; album went platinum on the strength of &quot;The Middle&quot;, which topped &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart. The mainstream success achieved by Jimmy Eat World paved the way for emo pop music that would appear during the rest of the 2000s, with emo pop becoming a very common style of emo music during the 2000s. The band Dashboard Confessional broke into the mainstream. Started by the band&#x27;s guitarist and lead vocalist Chris Carrabba, Dashboard Confessional are known for sometimes creating acoustic songs. Dashboard Confessional originally was a side project, as Carrabba was also a member of the emo band Further Seems Forever, and Vacant Andys, a punk rock band Carraba helped start in 1995. Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s album &quot;The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most&quot; peaked at number 5 on the Independent Albums chart. Dashboard Confessional was the first artist to record an episode of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. The 2002 resulting live album and video long-form was certified platinum by the RIAA on May 22, 2003, topped the Independent Albums chart, and, as of October 19, 2007, sold 316,000 copies. With Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s mainstream success, Carrabba appeared on a cover of the magazine &quot;Spin&quot; and according to Jim DeRogatis, &quot;has become the &#x27;face of emo&#x27; the way that Moby was deemed the prime exponent of techno or Kurt Cobain became the unwilling crown prince of grunge.&quot; Three of Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s studio albums, &quot;The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most&quot; (2001), &quot;A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar&quot; (2003), and &quot;Dusk and Summer&quot; (2006), all were certified gold by the RIAA during the mid-2000s. As of October 19, 2007, &quot;The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most&quot; has sold 599,000 copies. As of October 19, 2007, &quot;Dusk and Summer&quot; and &quot;A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar&quot; have sold 512,000 copies and 901,000 copies in the United States, respectively. As of October 19, 2007, Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s 2000 debut album &quot;The Swiss Army Romance&quot; sold 338,000 copies. On August 10, 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported how, &quot;from the three-chord laments of Alkaline Trio to the folky rants of Bright Eyes, from the erudite pop-punk of Brand New&quot; to the entropic anthems of Thursday, much of the most exciting rock music&quot; was appearing from the emo genre.

Saves the Day toured with Green Day, Blink-182 and Weezer, playing in large arenas such as Madison Square Garden. Saves the Day performed on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, appeared on the cover of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; and had music videos for &quot;At Your Funeral&quot; and &quot;Freakish&quot; in rotation on MTV2. Taking Back Sunday released their debut album, &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot;, on Victory Records in 2002. The album gave the band a taste of success in the emo scene with singles such as &quot;Cute Without the &#x27;E&#x27; (Cut from the Team)&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re So Last Summer&quot;. &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot; was eventually certified gold by the RIAA in 2005 and is considered one of emo&#x27;s most-influential albums. As of May 8, 2009, &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot; sold 790,000 copies. Articles on Vagrant Records appeared in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and the word &quot;emo&quot; became a catchall term for non-mainstream pop music.

In the wake of this success, many emo bands were signed to major record labels and the genre became marketable. According to DreamWorks Records senior A&amp;R representative Luke Wood, &quot;The industry really does look at emo as the new rap rock, or the new grunge. I don&#x27;t think that anyone is listening to the music that&#x27;s being made—they&#x27;re thinking of how they&#x27;re going to take advantage of the sound&#x27;s popularity at retail.&quot; Emo&#x27;s apolitical nature, catchy music and accessible themes had broad appeal for a young, mainstream audience. Emo bands that emerged or broke into the mainstream during this time were rejected by many fans of older emo music. As emo continued to be mainstream, it became quite common for emo bands to have black hair and wear eyeliner. Taking Back Sunday had continued success in the next few years, with their 2004 album &quot;Where You Want To Be&quot; both reaching number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and being certified gold by the RIAA in July 2005. The album, as of February 17, 2006, sold more than 700,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The band&#x27;s 2006 album, &quot;Louder Now&quot;, reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, was certified gold by the RIAA a little less than two months after its release date, and, as of May 8, 2009, sold 674,000 copies.

A darker, more aggressive style of emo was also becoming popular. New Jersey–based Thursday signed a multimillion-dollar, multi-album contract with Island Def Jam after their 2001 album, &quot;Full Collapse&quot;, reached number 178 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Their music was more political and lacked pop hooks and anthems, influenced instead by the Smiths, Joy Division, and the Cure. However, the band&#x27;s accessibility, basement-show roots and touring with Saves the Day made them part of the emo movement. Thursday&#x27;s 2003 album, &quot;War All the Time&quot;, reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Hawthorne Heights, Story of the Year, Underoath, and Alexisonfire, four bands frequently featured on MTV, have popularized screamo. Other screamo bands include Silverstein, Senses Fail and Vendetta Red. Underoath&#x27;s albums &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety&quot; (2004) and &quot;Define the Great Line&quot; (2006) both were certified gold by the RIAA. The Used&#x27;s self-titled album (2002) was certified gold by the RIAA on July 21, 2003. The Used&#x27;s self-titled album, as of August 22, 2009, has sold 841,000 copies. The Used&#x27;s album &quot;In Love and Death&quot; (2004) was certified gold by the RIAA on March 21, 2005. &quot;In Love and Death&quot;, as of January 2, 2007, sold 689,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Four Alexisonfire albums were certified gold or platinum in Canada.

Emo pop, a pop punk-oriented subgenre of emo with pop-influenced hooks, became the main emo style during the mid-to late 2000s, with many of these bands being signed by Fueled by Ramen Records and some adopting a goth-inspired look. My Chemical Romance broke into the mainstream with their 2004 album &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot;. My Chemical Romance is known for their goth-influenced emo appearance and creation of concept albums and rock operas. &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2005. The band&#x27;s success continued with its third album, &quot;The Black Parade&quot;, which sold 240,000 copies in its first week of release and was certified platinum by the RIAA in less than a year. Fall Out Boy&#x27;s album, &quot;From Under the Cork Tree&quot;, sold 2,700,000 copies in the United States. The band&#x27;s album, &quot;Infinity on High&quot;, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, sold 260,000 copies in its first week of release and sold 1,400,000 copies in the United States. Multiple Fall Out Boy songs reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Panic! at the Disco&#x27;s album, &quot;A Fever You Can&#x27;t Sweat Out&quot;, was certified double platinum by the RIAA and its single, &quot;I Write Sins Not Tragedies&quot;, reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Panic! at the Disco are known for combining emo with electronics and their album &quot;A Fever You Can&#x27;t Sweat Out&quot; is an emo album with elements of and baroque pop. The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus&#x27; &quot;Face Down&quot; peaked at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and its album, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Fake It&quot;, sold 852,000 copies in the United States. AFI&#x27;s albums &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Decemberunderground&quot; both were certified platinum by the RIAA, with &quot;Decemberunderground&quot; peaking at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Paramore&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Riot!&quot; was certified double platinum by the RIAA and several Paramore songs appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the late 2000s, including &quot;Misery Business&quot;, &quot;Decode&quot;, &quot;Crushcrushcrush&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s What You Get&quot;, and &quot;Ignorance&quot;.

===2010–present: Decline and emo revival===
By 2010, emo&#x27;s popularity began to decline. Many emo bands lost popularity or had changed genres; My Chemical Romance&#x27;s album, &quot;Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys&quot;, featured a traditional pop punk style. Paramore and Fall Out Boy both abandoned the emo genre with their 2013 albums, &quot;Paramore&quot; and &quot;Save Rock and Roll&quot;, respectively. Paramore moved to a new wave-influenced style. Panic! at the Disco also abandoned the emo pop genre to a synth-pop style on &quot;Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!&quot;. Many emo bands, including My Chemical Romance, Alexisonfire, and Thursday, disbanded, raising concerns about the genre&#x27;s viability.

During the latter 2010s, a mainly underground emo revival emerged, drawing on the sound and aesthetic of 1990s emo. Artists associated with this movement include Modern Baseball, the World Is a Beautiful Place &amp; I Am No Longer Afraid to Die, A Great Big Pile of Leaves, Pianos Become the Teeth, Empire! Empire! (I Was a Lonely Estate), Touché Amoré, Into It. Over It., and the Hotelier. While many 2010s emo bands draw on the sound and aesthetic of 1990s emo, hardcore punk elements are consistently used by 2010s emo bands such as Title Fight and Small Brown Bike.

In the 2020s, emo&#x27;s impact on mainstream music of the 2010s, as well as a revival of the genre itself, was noted in media outlets. The BBC observed in 2018 &quot;beyond guitar-based bands, the influence of emo can be seen in much of modern music, both in style and lyrical content&quot; and &quot;addressing mental health issues has become increasingly more common in pop&quot;.

==Subgenres and fusion genres==
===Subgenres===
====Screamo====


The term &quot;screamo&quot; was initially applied to an aggressive offshoot of emo which developed in San Diego in 1991 and used short songs grafting &quot;spastic intensity to willfully experimental dissonance and dynamics.&quot; Screamo is a dissonant form of emo influenced by hardcore punk, with typical rock instrumentation and noted for short songs, chaotic execution and screaming vocals.

The genre is &quot;generally based in the aggressive side of the overarching punk-revival scene.&quot; It began at the Ché Café with groups such as Heroin, Antioch Arrow, Angel Hair, Mohinder, Swing Kids, and Portraits of Past. They were influenced by Washington, D.C. post-hardcore (particularly Fugazi and Nation of Ulysses), straight edge, the Chicago group Articles of Faith, the hardcore-punk band Die Kreuzen and the post-punk and bands like Bauhaus. I Hate Myself is a band described as &quot;a cornerstone of the &#x27;screamo&#x27; genre&quot; by author Matt Walker: &quot;Musically, I Hate Myself relied on being very slow and deliberate, with sharp contrasts between quiet, almost meditative segments that rip into loud and heavy portions driven by Jim Marburger&#x27;s tidal wave scream.&quot; Other early screamo bands include Pg. 99, Saetia, and Orchid.

The Used, Thursday, Thrice and Hawthorne Heights, who all formed in the United States during the late 1990s and early 2000s and remained active throughout the 2000s, helped popularize screamo. Post-hardcore bands such as Refused and At the Drive-In paved the way for these bands. Screamo bands from the Canadian emo scene such as Silverstein and Alexisonfire also emerged at this time. By the mid-2000s, the saturation of the screamo scene caused many bands to expand beyond the genre and incorporate more-experimental elements. Non-screamo bands used the genre&#x27;s characteristic guttural vocal style. Some screamo bands during this time period were inspired by genres like pop punk and heavy metal.

Jeff Mitchell of the &quot;Iowa State Daily&quot; wrote, &quot;There is no set definition of what screamo sounds like but screaming over once deafeningly loud rocking noise and suddenly quiet, melodic guitar lines is a theme commonly affiliated with the genre.&quot;

=====Sass=====

Sass (also known as sassy screamo, sasscore, white belt hardcore, white belt, sassgrind or dancey screamo) is a style that emerged from the late-1990s and early-2000s screamo scene. The genre incorporates elements of post-punk, new wave, disco, electronic, dance-punk, grindcore, noise rock, metalcore, mathcore and beatdown hardcore. The genre is characterized by often incorporating overtly flamboyant mannerisms, erotic lyrical content, synthesizers, dance beats and a lisping vocal style. Sass bands include the Blood Brothers, An Albatross, The Number Twelve Looks Like You, the Plot to Blow Up the Eiffel Tower, Daughters&#x27;s early music, Orchid&#x27;s later music and SeeYouSpaceCowboy.

===Fusion genres===
====Emo pop====

Emo pop (or emo pop punk) is a subgenre of emo known for its pop music influences, more concise songs and hook-filled choruses. AllMusic describes emo pop as blending &quot;youthful angst&quot; with &quot;slick production&quot; and mainstream appeal, using &quot;high-pitched melodies, rhythmic guitars, and lyrics concerning adolescence, relationships, and heartbreak.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; described emo pop as a cross between &quot;saccharine boy-band pop&quot; and emo.

Emo pop developed during the 1990s. Bands like Jawbreaker and Samiam are known for formulating the emo pop punk style. According to Nicole Keiper of CMJ New Music Monthly, Sense Field&#x27;s &quot;Building&quot; (1996) pushed the band &quot;into the emo-pop camp with the likes of the Get Up Kids and Jejune&quot;. As emo became commercially successful in the early 2000s, emo pop became popular with Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Bleed American&quot; and the success of its single &quot;The Middle&quot;. Jimmy Eat World, the Get Up Kids and the Promise Ring also are early emo pop bands. The emo pop style of Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s album, &quot;Clarity&quot; influenced later emo. The emo band Braid&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Frame &amp; Canvas&quot; has been described as emo pop by Blake Butler of AllMusic, who gave the Braid album four out of five stars and wrote that &quot;Frame &amp; Canvas&quot; &quot;proves to be one of Braid&#x27;s best efforts&quot;. Emo pop became successful during the late 1990s, with its popularity increasing in the early 2000s. The Get Up Kids sold over 15,000 copies of their debut album, &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; (1997), before signing with Vagrant Records. The label promoted them, sending them on tours to open for Green Day and Weezer. Their 1999 album, &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot;, reached number 31 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart. As of May 2, 2002, &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; sold 134,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

As emo pop coalesced, the Fueled by Ramen label became a center of the movement and signed Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, and Paramore (all of whom had been successful). Two regional scenes developed. The Florida scene was created by Fueled by Ramen; midwest emo-pop was promoted by Pete Wentz, whose Fall Out Boy rose to the forefront of the style during the mid-2000s. Cash Cash released &quot;Take It to the Floor&quot; (2008); according to AllMusic, it could be &quot;the definitive statement of airheaded, glittery, and ... the transformation of emo from the expression of intensely felt, ripped-from-the-throat feelings played by bands directly influenced by post-punk and hardcore to mall-friendly Day-Glo pop played by kids who look about as authentic as the &quot;punks&quot; on an old episode of &quot;Quincy&quot; did back in the &#x27;70s was made pretty much complete&quot;. You Me at Six released their 2008 debut album, &quot;Take Off Your Colours&quot;, described by AllMusic&#x27;s Jon O&#x27;Brien as &quot;follow[ing] the &#x27;emo-pop for dummies&#x27; handbook word-for-word.&quot; The album was certified gold in the UK.

====Emo rap====
Emo rap, a genre that combines emo music with hip hop music, began in the mid–to late 2010s. Prominent artists of emo hip hop include Lil Peep, XXXTentacion, and Nothing,Nowhere. In the emo rap broke into the mainstream. Deceased rapper XXXTentacion&#x27;s song &quot;Sad!&quot; peaked at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on June 30, 2018. Lil Uzi Vert&#x27;s song &quot;XO Tour Llif3&quot; peaked at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the song was certified by the RIAA.

==Fashion and subculture==
The beginning of emo as a subculture rather than just a style of music dates back to the mid-1990s San Diego screamo scene. The scene&#x27;s bands, such as Heroin, Antioch Arrow and Swing Kids, and participants in this scene were often called &quot;spock rock&quot;, in reference to their black-dyed hair with straight fringes. As the vocalist of Swing Kids, Justin Pearson had choppy spikes protruding from the back of his head alongside straight fringes, which was a prototype for the emo haircut. During this time, emo fashion was clean-cut and tended towards geek chic, with clothing items like thick-rimmed glasses resembling 1950s musician Buddy Holly, button-down shirts, t-shirts, sweater vests, tight jeans, converse shoes, and cardigans being common.

Emo fashion in the mid-to late 2000s included skinny jeans, tight T-shirts (usually short-sleeved, and often with the names of emo bands), studded belts, Converse sneakers, Vans and black wristbands. Thick, horn-rimmed glasses remained in style to an extent, and eye liner and black fingernails became common during the mid-2000s. The best-known facet of emo fashion is its hairstyle: flat, straight, usually jet-black hair with long bangs covering much of the face, which has been called a fad. As emo became a subculture, people who dressed in emo fashion and associated themselves with its music were known as &quot;emo kids&quot; or &quot;emos&quot;.

==Controversy and backlash==

===Stereotypes===
Emo has been associated with a stereotype of emotion, sensitivity, shyness, introversion or angst. More controversially, stereotypes surrounding the genre included depression, self-harm and suicide, in part stoked by depictions of emo fans as a &quot;cult&quot; by British tabloid &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Emos and goths were often distinguished by the stereotype that &quot;emos hate themselves, while goths hate everyone.&quot; In 2020, &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote on such stereotypes, that &quot;emo was singled out for the destructive behaviour of teenagers who&#x27;d found a home in a subculture that offered them community and a vehicle for self-expression.&quot;

====Suicide and self harm====

In 2008, emo music was blamed for the suicide by hanging of British teenager Hannah Bond by the coroner at her inquest and her mother, Heather Bond, who suggested that the music and fandom glamorised suicide. They suggested Hannah&#x27;s apparent obsession with My Chemical Romance was linked to her death. It was said at the inquest that she was part of an Internet &quot;emo cult&quot;, and an image of an emo girl with bloody wrists was on her Bebo page. Hannah reportedly told her parents that her self-harm was an &quot;emo initiation ceremony&quot;. Heather Bond criticised emo culture: &quot;There are &#x27;emo&#x27; websites that show pink teddies hanging themselves.&quot; The coroner&#x27;s statements were featured in a series of articles in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. After they were reported in &quot;NME&quot;, fans of emo music contacted the magazine to deny that it promoted self-harm and suicide. My Chemical Romance reacted online: &quot;We have recently learned of the suicide and tragic loss of Hannah Bond. We&#x27;d like to send our condolences to her family during this time of mourning. Our hearts and thoughts are with them&quot;. The band also posted that they &quot;are and always have been vocally anti-violence and anti-suicide&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; later described the purported link and subsequent backlash against emo in the 2000s as a &quot;moral panic&quot;, while &quot;Kerrang!&quot; compared it to historic controversies involving Judas Priest and Ozzy Osbourne, unduly demonising the subculture, and poorly examining mental health issues of young people.

===Backlash===
Emo received significant backlash during the 2000s. Warped Tour founder Kevin Lyman said that there was a &quot;real backlash&quot; by bands on the tour against emo groups, but he dismissed the hostility as &quot;juvenile&quot;. The backlash intensified, with anti-emo groups attacking teenagers in Mexico City, Querétaro, and Tijuana in 2008. Legislation was proposed in Russia&#x27;s Duma regulating emo websites and banning emo attire in schools and government buildings, with the subculture perceived as a &quot;dangerous teen trend&quot; promoting anti-social behaviour, depression, social withdrawal and suicide. The BBC reported that in March 2012, Shia militias in Iraq shot or beat to death as many as 58 young Iraqi emos. Some metalheads and punks often were known for hating emos and criticizing the emo subculture.

===Terminology===
The term &quot;emo&quot; has been the subject of controversy amongst artists, critics, and fans alike. Some find the label to be loosely defined with the term at times being used to describe any music that expresses emotion. The mainstream success of emo and its related subculture caused the term to be conflated with other genres.

Many bands labeled as emo rejected the emo label. In Chris Payne&#x27;s book &quot;Where Are Your Boys Tonight?&quot; (2023), Bayside vocalist Anthony Raneri stated that he believed emo became &quot;a dirty word&quot; around the time of its mainstream success in the 2000s. He explains this derogatory use of the word derived from hipsters adopting the term to demean rock artists they saw as being &quot;not as cool as&quot; the popular indie rock groups of the time, namely the Strokes. My Chemical Romance singer Gerard Way said in 2007 that emo is &quot;a pile of shit&quot;: 

Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco said : &quot;It&#x27;s ignorant! The stereotype is guys that are weak and have failing relationships write about how sad they are. If you listen to our songs, not one of them has that tone.&quot; Adam Lazzara of Taking Back Sunday said he always considered his band rock and roll instead of emo. Guitarist of the Get Up Kids, Jim Suptic, noted the differences between the 2000s mainstream acts when compared to the emo bands of the 1990s, saying, “The punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different. It&#x27;s like glam rock now. We played the Bamboozle fests this year and we felt really out of place... If this is the world we helped create, then I apologise.” Vocalist of AFI, Davey Havok, described emo as “such a strange and meaningless word.” Early emo musicians also have rejected the label. Guy Picciotto, the vocalist of Rites of Spring, said he considers the emo label &quot;retarded&quot; and always considered Rites of Spring a punk rock band: &quot;The reason I think it&#x27;s so stupid is that - what, like the Bad Brains weren&#x27;t emotional? What - they were robots or something? It just doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.&quot; Sunny Day Real Estate&#x27;s members said they consider themselves simply a rock band, and said that back in the early days, the word &quot;emocore&quot; was an insult: &quot;While I don&#x27;t disrespect anyone for using the term emo-core, or rock, or anything, but back in the day, emo-core was just about the worst dis that you could throw on a band.&quot;

The term “mall emo” has been used to separate mainstream bands like Paramore, Hawthorne Heights, My Chemical Romance, Panic! at the Disco, and Fall Out Boy from the less commercially viable bands that proceeded and succeeded them. The term &quot;mall emo&quot; dates back to around 2002, when many emo fans did not like the change emo was going through at the time when the genre became mainstream.

Tom Mullen, editor of the &quot;Anthology of Emo&quot; book, created the website Washed Up Emo in 2007 in response to the mainstream perceptions of the genre, intending to impart information about the genre&#x27;s history. He later created the website Is This Band Emo? in 2014, which explains whether various bands are classified under the genre alongside humorous responses.

In 2025, a mollusk fossil was named after the genre as &quot;Emo vorticaudum&quot;. The name was chosen to reflect the distinct characteristics of the mollusk. According to Sanjana Gajbhiye of Earth.com, &quot;[Emo] was named for its elongated, folded posture, which suggested unusual and unconventional ways of moving. Its name reflects individuality and adaptability, much like the cultural association with the emo style.&quot;

<text>Category 3 cable, commonly known as  or station wire, and less commonly known as VG or voice-grade (as, for example, in 100BaseVG), is an unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable used in telephone wiring. It is part of a family of standards defined jointly by the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) and the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and published in TIA/EIA-568-B.

Although designed to reliably carry data up to , modern data networks run at much higher speeds, and or better cable is generally used for new installations. Cat 3 cables may have 2, 3, 4, or more pairs.

==Networking==

 was widely used in computer networking in the early 1990s for 10BASE-T Ethernet and, to a much lesser extent, for 100BaseVG Ethernet, Token Ring and 100BASE-T4. The original Power over Ethernet 802.3af specification supports the use of cable, but the later 802.3at Type 2 high-power variation does not. In some use cases and for short distances, Cat 3 may be capable of carrying 100BASE-TX (2 pairs) or even 1000BASE-T (4 pairs). Such use cases include hobbyist retrofitting short home telephone Cat 3 networks for Ethernet.

Dedicated 100BASE-T4 networks, supporting over Cat 3, appear to have been a rarity as very few network interface controllers and switches were ever released. Some examples include the 3com 3C250-T4 Superstack II HUB 100, IBM 8225 Fast Ethernet Stackable Hub and Intel LinkBuilder FMS 100 T4. The same applies to network interface controller cards. Bridging 100BASE-T4 with 100BASE-TX required additional network equipment.

==Replacement==
Starting in the mid-1990s, new structured cabling installations were often built with the higher performing cable required by 100BASE-TX. or is now used for all modern structured cabling installations. Many large institutions have policies that any upgrade to a network using must involve upgrading to .

<doc id="100635" wikidata="Q2975579" url="?curid=100635" title="Major suit">
<text>In the card game contract bridge, the major suits are spades () and hearts (). The major suits are of prime importance for tactics and scoring as they outrank the minor suits while bidding and also outscore them (30 per contracted trick for major suits—compared to 20 for minor suits). Much of the tactics of bidding in bridge revolves around the attempt by partners to find a &quot;fit&quot; in one of the major suits that will allow them to make a game contract. Another reason why the major suits is more desirable than the minor suits is that they need one less trick to make game. Of the two major suits, spades rank higher than hearts.

==Suit combinations==
Fundamentally, there are three ways to divide four suits into pairs: by &quot;color&quot;, by &quot;rank&quot; and by &quot;shape&quot; resulting in six possible suit combinations.
* Color is used to denote the &quot;red&quot; suits (hearts and diamonds) and the &quot;black&quot; suits (spades and clubs).
* Rank is used to indicate the &quot;major&quot; (spades and hearts) versus &quot;minor&quot; (diamonds and clubs) suits.
* Shape is used to denote the &quot;pointed&quot; (diamonds and spades, which visually have a sharp point uppermost) versus &quot;rounded&quot; (hearts and clubs) suits. This is used only as a mnemonic.

<text>Marie Alice Heine (10 February 1857 – 22 December 1925) was an American-born Princess of Monaco, by marriage to Prince Albert I of Monaco. Marcel Proust used her as a model for the Princesse de Luxembourg in his novel, &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. Her first husband was the Duke of Richelieu, and one of the titles of her second husband was Duke of Mazarin; she was thus unique in bearing the titles of both Cardinal Richelieu and Cardinal Mazarin.

==Early life==
Marie Alice Heine was born at 910 Rue Royale, in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Her French father, Michel Heine, was a scion of a prominent German-rooted Berlin and Paris banking Jewish family. His brother was Armand Heine, and both were cousins of poet Heinrich Heine and of journalist and press publisher Gustav Heine, later Baron Heine von Geldern. Michel was born in Bordeaux, France, and moved to New Orleans in 1843, and become a successful financier and real-estate developer. Heine&#x27;s mother was Marie Amélie Céleste Miltenberger, daughter of Joseph Alphonse Miltenberger, an architect and cast-iron importer by trade of French Alsatian descent, and his Creole wife, Marie Céleste Dorfeville. Her family built three interconnected Miltenberger mansions on Rue Royale. She had two younger brothers, Paul Henri and Isaac Georges.

The American Civil War sent the family back to France, where the teenaged Alice&#x27;s youth and beauty, and her family&#x27;s wealth, made a great impression in Parisian society. A &amp; M Heine, her father&#x27;s firm, helped finance Napoleon III&#x27;s war with Prussia.

Michel and Amélie became regulars in the court of Napoleon III, who, along with the Empress Eugénie, became godparents to the New Orleans-born Heine.

==Personal life ==

She had been christened in New Orleans.

She married her first husband, Marie Odet &quot;Armand&quot; Aimable Chapelle de Jumilhac, Marquis of Jumilhac then 7th Duke of Richelieu and Duke of Aiguillon, in Paris on February 27, 1875. They had one son and one daughter:

* Marie Odet Jean &quot;Armand&quot; Chapelle de Jumilhac (1875–1952), who became the 8th and last Duke of Richelieu, as well as the Duke of Aiguillon and Marquis of Jumilhac, upon the death of his father in Athens on June 28, 1880. In 1913, he married Eleanor Douglas Wise (1890–1972) of Maryland, United States, daughter of John Sergeant Wise. Without issue.
* &quot;Odile&quot; Marie Auguste Septimanie Chapelle de Jumilhac (1879–1974), who in 1905 married Gabriel Marie François Hippolyte Ferri Eugène de La Rochefoucauld (1875–1942), becoming the Countess de La Rochefoucauld and later on June 22, 1909, Princess de La Rochefoucauld Kingdom of Bavaria (cousin of the Prince de La Rochefoucauld-Montbel). They had a daughter, Anne Alice Elisabeth Amélie de La Rochefoucauld (1906–1980), who married twice and had no issue.

===Princess consort of Monaco===
Heine first met Albert, Hereditary Prince of Monaco, in Madeira in 1879. At the time, Albert was still in an unhappy marriage with Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton. Albert&#x27;s first marriage was eventually annulled by the Church on January 3, 1880, and he and Alice began a relationship soon thereafter. Alice married Albert on October 30, 1889, shortly after his accession. According to Thomas Fouilleron, director of the Monaco Palace Archives, &quot;Prince Albert I was deeply in love with her. It is one of the very first love marriages of the Principality&quot;.

Albert was interested in oceanography and was often on sea expeditions. While he was away, Heine took a greater interest in the Monegasque opera season. She &quot;set about bringing class and distinction to a country financed by the casino at Monte Carlo&quot;, and devoted her energies to making Monaco one of Europe&#x27;s great cultural centers with its opera, theater, and the ballet under the direction of the famed Russian impresario, Sergei Diaghilev. Her affair with singer-composer Isidore de Lara resulted in Prince Albert slapping her in view of an audience at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo.

Alice and Prince Albert I separated judicially on May 30, 1902 (Monaco), and June 3, 1902 (France), but remained married. Upon the prince&#x27;s death 20 years later, Alice became the Dowager Princess of Monaco. She did not remarry.

==Legacy==
Her former home in New Orleans is one of the most photographed buildings in the French Quarter. Today, The Royal Courtyard Bistro &amp; Bar, Nola Rock Company and Frank Relle Photography all occupy this mansion.

<doc id="100637" wikidata="Q1810435" url="?curid=100637" title="Al-Darazi">
<text>Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il al-Darazi (; died 1018) was an 11th-century Isma&#x27;ili preacher and early leader of the Druze faith who was labeled a heretic in 1016 and subsequently executed in 1018 by the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ().

==Life==

Little information is known about the early life of al-Darazi. He was of turkish origin and He was also known as &quot;Nashtakin&quot;. According to most sources, he was born in Bukhara. He is believed to have been of Persian origins and his title &quot;Darazi&quot; is Persian – meaning &#x27;the tailor&#x27;, although some sources state that he could be of Turkic descent. He arrived in Cairo in 1015, or 1017, after which he joined the newly emerged Druze movement which had emerged from Isma&#x27;ilism.

Al-Darazi was converted to be one of the early preachers of the Unity faith (which became known as the Druze faith). At that time, the movement enlisted a large number of adherents. However, he was later considered a renegade and is usually described by the Druze as following the traits of Satan, in particular, arrogance.

This view is based on the observation that as the number of his followers grew, he became obsessed with his leadership and gave himself the title “The Sword of the Faith” (&quot;Sayf ad-Dīn&quot;). In the &quot;Epistles of Wisdom&quot;, Hamza ibn Ali warns al-Darazi, saying, &quot;“Faith does not need a sword to aid it.”&quot; &quot;ad-Dīn la yahtāj ilā sayf lī yansurāh&quot;. However, al-Darazi ignored Hamza&#x27;s warnings and continued to challenge the Imam. This attitude led to disputes between al-Darazi and Hamza ibn Ali, who disliked his behaviour. Al-Darazi argued that he should be the leader of the Da’wa rather than Hamza ibn Ali and gave himself the title “Lord of the Guides”, because Caliph al-Hakim referred to Hamza as “Guide of the Consented”.

By 1018, al-Darazi had gathered around him partisans – &quot;Darazites&quot; – who believed that universal reason became incarnated in Adam at the beginning of the world, was then passed from him to the prophets, then into Ali and hence into his descendants, the Fatimid Caliphs. Al-Darazi wrote a book laying out this doctrine. He read from his book in the principal mosque in Cairo, which caused riots and protests against his claims and many of his followers were killed. Hamza ibn Ali refuted his ideology calling him &quot;the insolent one and Satan&quot;. The controversy created by al-Darazi led Caliph al-Hakim to suspend the Druze da&#x27;wa in 1018 AD.

In an attempt to gain the support of al-Hakim, al-Darazi started preaching that al-Hakim and his ancestors were the incarnation of God.

It is believed that al-Darazi allowed wine, forbidden marriages and taught metempsychosis although it has been argued that his actions might have been exaggerated by contemporary and later historians and polemicists.

==Death==

An inherently modest man, al-Hakim did not believe that he was God, and felt al-Darazi was trying to depict himself as a new prophet. Al-Hakim preferred Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad over him and al-Darazi was executed in 1018, leaving Hamza the sole leader of the new faith.

==Aftermath==

Even though the Druze do not consider al-Darazi the founder of their faith (rather, they refer to him as their &quot;first heretic&quot;), rival groups probably attached the name of the controversial preacher to the new sect and it has stuck with them ever since. Druze refer to themselves as &quot;unitarians&quot; (&quot;al-Muwahhidūn&quot;).

<doc id="100638" wikidata="Q1331104" url="?curid=100638" title="Controllability">
<text>Controllability is an important property of a control system and plays a crucial role in many control problems, such as stabilization of unstable systems by feedback, or optimal control.

Controllability and observability are dual aspects of the same problem.

Roughly, the concept of controllability denotes the ability to move a system around in its entire configuration space using only certain admissible manipulations. The exact definition varies slightly within the framework or the type of models applied.

The following are examples of variations of controllability notions which have been introduced in the systems and control literature:
* State controllability
* Output controllability
* Controllability in the behavioural framework

== State controllability ==

The state of a deterministic system, which is the set of values of all the system&#x27;s state variables (those variables characterized by dynamic equations), completely describes the system at any given time. In particular, no information on the past of a system is needed to help in predicting the future, if the states at the present time are known and all current and future values of the control variables (those whose values can be chosen) are known.

&quot;Complete state controllability&quot; (or simply &quot;controllability&quot; if no other context is given) describes the ability of an external input (the vector of control variables) to move the internal state of a system from any initial state to any final state in a finite time interval.

That is, we can informally define controllability as follows:
If for any initial state formula_1 and any final state formula_2 there exists an input sequence to transfer the system state from formula_1 to formula_2 in a finite time interval, then the system modeled by the state-space representation is controllable. For the simplest example of a continuous, LTI system, the row dimension of the state space expression formula_5 determines the interval; each row contributes a vector in the state space of the system. If there are not enough such vectors to span the state space of formula_6, then the system cannot achieve controllability. It may be necessary to modify formula_7 and formula_8 to better approximate the underlying differential relationships it estimates to achieve controllability.

Controllability does not mean that a reached state can be maintained, merely that any state can be reached.

Controllability does not mean that arbitrary paths can be made through state space, only that there exists a path within the prescribed finite time interval.

== Continuous linear systems ==

Consider the continuous linear system 

: formula_9
: formula_10

There exists a control formula_11 from state formula_12 at time formula_13 to state formula_14 at time formula_15 if and only if formula_16 is in the column space of
: formula_17
where formula_18 is the state-transition matrix, and formula_19 is the Controllability Gramian.

In fact, if formula_20 is a solution to formula_21 then a control given by formula_22 would make the desired transfer.

Note that the matrix formula_23 defined as above has the following properties:
* formula_19 is symmetric
* formula_19 is positive semidefinite for formula_26
* formula_19 satisfies the linear matrix differential equation
:: formula_28
* formula_19 satisfies the equation
:: formula_30

== Rank condition for controllability==
The Controllability Gramian involves integration of the state-transition matrix of a system. A simpler condition for controllability is a rank condition analogous to the Kalman rank condition for time-invariant systems.

Consider a continuous-time linear system formula_31 smoothly varying in an interval formula_32 of formula_33:

: formula_9
: formula_10

The state-transition matrix formula_18 is also smooth. Introduce the n x m matrix-valued function formula_37 and define 
: formula_38 = formula_39.
Consider the matrix of matrix-valued functions obtained by listing all the columns of the formula_40, formula_41:

formula_42.

If there exists a formula_43 and a nonnegative integer k such that formula_44, then formula_31 is controllable.

If formula_31 is also analytically varying in an interval formula_32, then formula_31 is controllable on every nontrivial subinterval of formula_32 if and only if there exists a formula_43 and a nonnegative integer k such that formula_51.

The above methods can still be complex to check, since it involves the computation of the state-transition matrix formula_18. Another equivalent condition is defined as follow. Let formula_53, and for each formula_54, define

: formula_55= formula_56 
In this case, each formula_57 is obtained directly from the data formula_58 The system is controllable if there exists a formula_43 and a nonnegative integer formula_60 such that formula_61.

=== Example ===

Consider a system varying analytically in formula_62 and matrices

formula_63, formula_64 
Then 
formula_65 and since this matrix has rank 3, the system is controllable on every nontrivial interval of formula_33.

=== Continuous linear time-invariant (LTI) systems ===

Consider the continuous linear time-invariant system

: formula_67
: formula_68

where 
: formula_6 is the formula_70 &quot;state vector&quot;,
: formula_71 is the formula_72 &quot;output vector&quot;,
: formula_73 is the formula_74 &quot;input (or control) vector&quot;,
: formula_75 is the formula_76 &quot;state matrix&quot;,
: formula_77 is the formula_78 &quot;input matrix&quot;,
: formula_79 is the formula_80 &quot;output matrix&quot;,
: formula_81 is the formula_82 &quot;feedthrough (or feedforward) matrix&quot;.

The formula_83 controllability matrix is given by

:formula_84

The system is controllable if the controllability matrix has full row rank (i.e. formula_85).

== Discrete linear time-invariant (LTI) systems ==

For a discrete-time linear state-space system (i.e. time variable formula_86) the state equation is

:formula_87

where formula_75 is an formula_76 matrix and formula_77 is a formula_78 matrix (i.e. formula_73 is formula_93 inputs collected in a formula_74 vector). The test for controllability is that the formula_83 matrix

:formula_96

has full row rank (i.e., formula_97). That is, if the system is controllable, formula_98 will have formula_99 columns that are linearly independent; if formula_99 columns of formula_98 are linearly independent, each of the formula_99 states is reachable by giving the system proper inputs through the variable formula_103.

===Derivation===

Given the state formula_104 at an initial time, arbitrarily denoted as &quot;k&quot;=0, the state equation gives formula_105 then formula_106 and so on with repeated back-substitutions of the state variable, eventually yielding

:formula_107

or equivalently

:formula_108

Imposing any desired value of the state vector formula_109 on the left side, this can always be solved for the stacked vector of control vectors if and only if the matrix of matrices at the beginning of the right side has full row rank.

===Example===
For example, consider the case when formula_110 and formula_111 (i.e. only one control input). Thus, formula_77 and formula_113 are formula_114 vectors. If formula_115 has rank 2 (full rank), and so formula_77 and formula_117 are linearly independent and span the entire plane. If the rank is 1, then formula_77 and formula_117 are collinear and do not span the plane.

Assume that the initial state is zero.

At time formula_120: formula_121

At time formula_122: formula_123

At time formula_120 all of the reachable states are on the line formed by the vector formula_77.
At time formula_122 all of the reachable states are linear combinations of formula_117 and formula_77.
If the system is controllable then these two vectors can span the entire plane and can be done so for time formula_129.
The assumption made that the initial state is zero is merely for convenience.
Clearly if all states can be reached from the origin then any state can be reached from another state (merely a shift in coordinates).

This example holds for all positive formula_99, but the case of formula_110 is easier to visualize.

===Analogy for example of &quot;n&quot; = 2===
Consider an analogy to the previous example system.
You are sitting in your car on an infinite, flat plane and facing north.
The goal is to reach any point in the plane by driving a distance in a straight line, come to a full stop, turn, and driving another distance, again, in a straight line.
If your car has no steering then you can only drive straight, which means you can only drive on a line (in this case the north-south line since you started facing north).
The lack of steering case would be analogous to when the rank of formula_79 is 1 (the two distances you drove are on the same line).

Now, if your car did have steering then you could easily drive to any point in the plane and this would be the analogous case to when the rank of formula_79 is 2.

If you change this example to formula_134 then the analogy would be flying in space to reach any position in 3D space (ignoring the orientation of the aircraft).
You are allowed to:
*fly in a straight line
*turn left or right by any amount (Yaw)
*direct the plane upwards or downwards by any amount (Pitch)
Although the 3-dimensional case is harder to visualize, the concept of controllability is still analogous.

== Nonlinear systems ==
Nonlinear systems in the control-affine form

: formula_135

are locally accessible about formula_12 if the accessibility distribution formula_137 spans formula_99 space, when formula_99 equals the rank of formula_140 and R is given by:

:formula_141

Here, formula_142 is the repeated Lie bracket operation defined by

: formula_143

The controllability matrix for linear systems in the previous section can in fact be derived from this equation.

== Null Controllability ==
If a discrete control system is null-controllable, it means that there exists a controllable formula_103 so that formula_145 for some initial state formula_146. In other words, it is equivalent to the condition that there exists a matrix formula_147 such that formula_148 is nilpotent.

This can be easily shown by controllable-uncontrollable decomposition.

== Output controllability ==

&quot;Output controllability&quot; is the related notion for the output of the system (denoted &quot;y&quot; in the previous equations); the output controllability describes the ability of an external input to move the output from any initial condition to any final condition in a finite time interval. It is not necessary that there is any relationship between state controllability and output controllability. In particular:
* A controllable system is not necessarily output controllable. For example, if matrix &quot;D&quot; = 0 and matrix &quot;C&quot; does not have full row rank, then some positions of the output are masked by the limiting structure of the output matrix, and therefore unachievable. Moreover, even though the system can be moved to any state in finite time, there may be some outputs that are inaccessible by all states. A trivial numerical example uses &quot;D&quot;=0 and a &quot;C&quot; matrix with at least one row of zeros; thus, the system is not able to produce a non-zero output along that dimension.
* An output controllable system is not necessarily state controllable. For example, if the dimension of the state space is greater than the dimension of the output, then there will be a set of possible state configurations for each individual output. That is, the system can have significant zero dynamics, which are trajectories of the system that are not observable from the output. Consequently, being able to drive an output to a particular position in finite time says nothing about the state configuration of the system.

For a linear continuous-time system, like the example above, described by matrices formula_75, formula_77, formula_79, and formula_81, the formula_153 &quot;output controllability matrix&quot;
:formula_154
has full row rank (i.e. rank formula_155) if and only if the system is output controllable.

== Controllability under input constraints ==

In systems with limited control authority, it is often no longer possible to move any initial state to any final state inside the controllable subspace. This phenomenon is caused by constraints on the input that could be inherent to the system (e.g. due to saturating actuator) or imposed on the system for other reasons (e.g. due to safety-related concerns). The controllability of systems with input and state constraints is studied in the context of reachability and viability theory.

== Controllability in the behavioral framework ==

In the so-called behavioral system theoretic approach due to Willems (see people in systems and control), models considered do not directly define an input–output structure. In this framework systems are described by admissible trajectories of a collection of variables, some of which might be interpreted as inputs or outputs.

A system is then defined to be controllable in this setting, if any past part of a behavior (trajectory of the external variables) can be concatenated with any future trajectory of the behavior in such a way that the concatenation is contained in the behavior, i.e. is part of the admissible system behavior.

== Stabilizability ==
A slightly weaker notion than controllability is that of stabilizability. A system is said to be stabilizable when all uncontrollable state variables can be made to have stable dynamics. Thus, even though some of the state variables cannot be controlled (as determined by the controllability test above) all the state variables will still remain bounded during the system&#x27;s behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson+Moore/book:1989&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reachable set ==
Let T ∈ Т and x ∈ &quot;X&quot; (where X is the set of all possible states and Т is an interval of time). The reachable set from x in time T is defined as:

formula_156, where xz denotes that there exists a state transition from x to z in time T.

For autonomous systems the reachable set is given by :
:formula_157,
where R is the controllability matrix.

In terms of the reachable set, the system is controllable if and only if formula_158.

Proof 
We have the following equalities:
:formula_159
:formula_160
:formula_161
Considering that the system is controllable, the columns of R should be linearly independent. So:
:formula_162
:formula_163
:formula_164

A related set to the reachable set is the controllable set, defined by:
:formula_165.
The relation between reachability and controllability is presented by Sontag:

(a) An n-dimensional discrete linear system is controllable if and only if:
:: formula_166 (Where X is the set of all possible values or states of x and k is the time step).
(b) A continuous-time linear system is controllable if and only if:
:: formula_167 for all e&gt;0.
if and only if formula_168 for all e&gt;0.

Example
Let the system be an n dimensional discrete-time-invariant system from the formula:
::formula_169 (Where formula_18(final time, initial time, state variable, restrictions) is defined as the transition matrix of a state variable x from an initial time 0 to a final time n with some restrictions w).
It follows that the future state is in formula_171 if and only if it is in formula_172, the image of the linear map formula_137, defined as:
::formula_174,
which maps,
::formula_175
When formula_176 and formula_177 we identify formula_178 with a formula_179 matrix whose columns are formula_180 in that order. If the system is controllable the rank of formula_181 is formula_99. If this is true, the image of the linear map formula_137 is all of formula_184. Based on that, we have:
::formula_166 with formula_186.

<text>Dim sum () is a large range of small Chinese dishes that are traditionally enjoyed in restaurants for brunch. Most modern dim sum dishes are commonly associated with Cantonese cuisine, although dim sum dishes also exist in other Chinese cuisines. In the tenth century, when the city of Canton (Guangzhou) began to experience an increase in commercial travel, many frequented teahouses for small-portion meals with tea called &quot;yum cha&quot; (brunch). &quot;Yum cha&quot; includes two related concepts. The first is &quot;jat zung loeng gin&quot; (), which translates literally as &quot;one cup, two pieces&quot;. This refers to the custom of serving teahouse customers two delicately made food items, savory or sweet, to complement their tea. The second is &quot;dim sum&quot;, which translates literally to &quot;touch the heart&quot;, the term used to designate the small food items that accompanied the tea.

Teahouse owners gradually added various snacks called dim sum to their offerings. The practice of having tea with dim sum eventually evolved into the modern &quot;yum cha&quot;. Cantonese dim sum culture developed rapidly during the latter half of the nineteenth century in Guangzhou. Cantonese dim sum was originally based on local foods. As dim sum continued to develop, chefs introduced influences and traditions from other regions of China. Cantonese dim sum has a very broad range of flavors, textures, cooking styles, and ingredients and can be classified into regular items, seasonal offerings, weekly specials, banquet dishes, holiday dishes, house signature dishes, and travel-friendly items, as well as breakfast or lunch foods and late-night snacks.

Some estimates claim that there are at least two thousand types of dim sum in total across China, but only about forty to fifty types are commonly sold outside of China. There are over one thousand dim sum dishes originating from Guangdong alone, a total that no other area in China comes even close to matching. In fact, the cookbooks of most Chinese food cultures tend to combine their own variations on dim sum dishes with other local snacks. But that is not the case with Cantonese dim sum, which has developed into a separate branch of cuisine. 

Dim sum restaurants typically have a wide variety of dishes, usually totaling several dozen. The tea is very important, just as important as the food. Many Cantonese restaurants serve dim sum as early as five in the morning, while more traditional restaurants typically serve dim sum until mid-afternoon. Some Restaurants in Hong Kong and Guangdong province even offers dim sum all day till late night. Dim sum restaurants have a unique serving method where servers offer dishes to customers from steam-heated carts. It is now commonplace for restaurants to serve dim sum at dinner and sell various dim sum items à la carte for takeout. In addition to traditional dim sum, some chefs also create and prepare new fusion-based dim sum dishes. There are also variations designed for visual appeal on social media, such as dumplings and buns made to resemble animals.

== Etymology ==
The original meaning of the term &quot;dim sum&quot; remains unclear and contested. Some references state that the term originated in the Eastern Jin dynasty (317 AD–420 AD). According to one legend, to show soldiers gratitude after battles, a general had civilians make buns and cakes to send to the front lines. &quot;Gratitude&quot; or 點點心意 (), later shortened to , of which is the Cantonese pronunciation, came to represent dishes made in a similar fashion.

Some versions date the legend to the Southern Song dynasty (960–1279) after the term&#x27;s earliest attestation in the &quot;Book of Tang&quot; (). Written in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–979), the book uses dim sum as a verb instead: 「治妝未畢, 我未及餐, 爾且可點心」(), which translates to &quot;I have not finished preparing myself and am not ready for a proper meal; therefore, you can treat yourself to some small snacks.&quot; In this context, &quot;dim sum&quot; means &quot;to barely fill your stomach&quot;. Dim sum dishes are usually associated with &quot;yum cha&quot; (), which is known as the Cantonese brunch tradition. Chinese food historian Yan-kit So has described dim sum as:Literally translated as &quot;so close to the heart&quot;, they are, in reality, a large range of hors d&#x27;oeuvres Cantonese people traditionally enjoy in restaurants (previously teahouses) for breakfast and lunch but never for dinner, washed down with tea. &quot;Let&#x27;s go yum cha&quot; (to drink tea) is understood among the Cantonese to mean going to a restaurant for dim sum; such is the twin linkage between the food and the beverage.

== Cuisine ==
There are at least two thousand types of dim sum in total across China, and over one thousand available in Guangdong alone. Dim sum are usually eaten as breakfast or brunch. Cantonese dim sum has a very broad range of flavors, textures, cooking styles, and ingredients, and can be classified into regular items, seasonal offerings, weekly specials, banquet dishes, holiday dishes, house signature dishes, travel-friendly, as well as breakfast or lunch foods and late night snacks.

The subtropical climate of the southeast quadrant of Guangdong partly influences dim sum&#x27;s portion size. It can cause a decrease in appetite, so that people prefer eating scaled-down meals throughout the day rather than the customary three large meals. Teahouses in Guangzhou served &quot;three teas and two meals,&quot; which included lunch and dinner, and breakfast, afternoon and evening teas with dim sum.

Many dim sum dishes are made of seafood, chopped meats, or vegetables wrapped in dough or thin wrappings and steamed, deep-fried, or pan-fried. A traditional dim sum brunch includes various types of steamed buns, such as &quot;cha siu bao&quot; (a steamed bun filled with barbecue pork), rice or wheat dumplings, and rice noodle rolls that contain a range of ingredients, including beef, chicken, pork, prawns, and vegetarian options. Many dim sum restaurants also offer plates of steamed green vegetables, stuffed eggplant, stuffed green peppers, roasted meats, congee and other soups. Dessert dim sum is also available and can be ordered at any time since there is not a set sequence for the meal.

It is customary to order &quot;family-style&quot;, sharing the small dishes consisting of three or four pieces of dim sum among all members of the dining party. Small portion sizes allow people to try a wide variety of food.

Tea is considered to be very important, so much so that it is considered just as important as the food itself. Teas served during dim sum include:

* Chrysanthemum tea: instead of tea leaves, it is a flower-based tisane (herbal tea) made from flowers of the species &quot;Chrysanthemum morifolium&quot; or &quot;Chrysanthemum indicum&quot;, which are the most popular in East Asia. To prepare the tea, chrysanthemum flowers (usually dried) are steeped in hot water (usually after cooling from a boil) in a teapot, cup, or glass. A common mix with pu-erh is called &quot;guk pou&quot; () from its component teas.
* Green tea: freshly picked leaves that go through heating and drying processes but not oxidation, so keep their original green color and chemical compounds, like polyphenols and chlorophyll. Produced all over China, and the most popular category of tea, green teas include the representative Dragon Well () and Biluochun from Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, respectively.
* Oolong tea: partially oxidizing the tea leaves imparts them with characteristics of both green and black teas. Oolong teas are closer in taste to green than black tea, yet have less of a &quot;grassy&quot; taste. Major oolong-tea producing areas such as Fujian, Guangdong, and Taiwan line the southeastern coast of China. Tieguanyin or Ti Kuan Yin (): one of the most popular, originated in Fujian province and is a premium variety with a delightful fragrance.
* Pounei (Cantonese) or pu-erh tea (Mandarin): usually a compressed tea, pu-erh has unique, earthy notes derived from years of fermentation.
* Scented teas: various mixes of flowers with green, black, or oolong teas exist. Flowers used include jasmine, gardenia, magnolia, grapefruit flower, sweet-scented osmanthus and rose. Strict rules govern the proportion of flowers to tea. Jasmine tea, the most popular scented tea, is the one most often served at &quot;yum cha&quot; establishments.

The tea service includes several customs. Typically, the server starts by asking diners which tea to serve. According to etiquette, the person closest to the tea pot pours tea for the others. Sometimes, a younger person will serve an older person.

Those receiving tea express thanks by tapping their index and middle fingers twice on the table. According to one legend, the finger-tapping tradition evolved from an incident when an emperor poured tea for his servant in a public teahouse during a trip where the emperor concealed his identity to mingle with the commoners. Having been instructed by the emperor to not expose his identity to the public, the servant showed gratitude by improvising the finger-tapping gesture instead of what should have been a kowtow, which would have betrayed the emperor&#x27;s noble status. The practice gradually evolved to represent gratitude for having tea poured by others.

Diners also flip open the lid (of hinged metal tea pots) or offset the tea pot cover (on ceramic tea pots) to signal an empty pot; servers will then refill the pot.

== History ==
Dim sum is part of the Chinese tradition of snacks originating from the Song dynasty (960–1279), when royal chefs created various dishes such as minced pheasant, lark tongue, and desserts made from steamed milk and bean paste. Guangzhou experienced an increase in commercial travel in the tenth century At that time, travelers would frequent teahouses for small-portion meals with tea called &quot;yum cha&quot; or &quot;tea&quot; meals. &quot;Yum cha&quot; includes two related concepts. The first, , translates literally as &quot;one cup, two pieces&quot;. This refers to the custom of serving teahouse customers two delicately made food items, savory or sweet, to complement their tea. The second, , which means dim sum, translates literally to &quot;touch the heart&quot; (i.e., heart touching). This is the term used to designate the small food items that accompanied the drinking of tea.

During the thirteenth century, when the Mongols invaded China, the royal court fled to southern China, bringing a royal influence to the dim sum of Guangzhou. Guangzhou was a wealthy, large port city that had international visitors, a temperate climate, and a coastline where fresh and tropical ingredients were grown, resulting in an ideal environment for food and entertainment. In Guangzhou, street vendors and teahouses sold dim sum. The practice of having tea with dim sum at tea houses eventually evolved into modern &quot;yum cha&quot;. While at the teahouses, travelers selected their preferred snacks from carts. Visitors to tea houses often socialized as they ate, and business people negotiated deals over dim sum.

During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the Tea and Horses Bureau was established to monitor tea production and improve tea quality. The improvements in tea quality also led to teahouse improvements.

Cantonese dim sum culture developed rapidly during the latter half of the nineteenth century in Guangzhou. Teahouse dining areas were typically located upstairs, and initial dim sum fare included steamed buns. Eventually, these evolved into specialized dim sum restaurants, and the variety and quality of dim sum dishes rapidly followed suit. Cantonese dim sum was originally based on local foods such as sweet roast pork called &quot;char siu&quot; and fresh rice noodles. As dim sum continued to develop, chefs introduced influences and traditions from other regions of China, which created a starting point for the wide variety of dim sum available today. Chefs created a large range of dim sum that even today comprises most of a teahouse&#x27;s dim sum offerings. Part of this development included reducing portion sizes of larger dishes originally from northern China, such as stuffed steamed buns, so they could easily be incorporated into the dim sum menu. The rapid growth in dim sum restaurants was due partly because people found the preparation of dim sum dishes to be time-consuming and preferred the convenience of dining out and eating a large variety of baked, steamed, pan-fried, deep-fried, and braised foods. Dim sum continued to develop and also spread southward to Hong Kong.

Although dim sum is normally considered Cantonese, it includes many additional influences. Over thousands of years, as people in China migrated in search of different places to live, they carried the recipes of their favorite foods and continued to prepare and serve these dishes. Many Han Chinese migrated south, seeking warmer climates. Settlements took shape in the Yangtze River Valley, the central highlands, and the coastal southeast, including Guangdong. The influence of Suzhou and Hangzhou is found in vegetarian soy skin rolls and pearl meatballs. The dessert squares flavored with red dates or wolfberries are influenced by Beijing desserts. Savory dishes, such as pot stickers and steamed dumplings, include Muslim influences because of people traveling from Central Asia across the Silk Road and into Guangdong. These are just a few examples of how a wide range of influences became incorporated into traditional Cantonese dim sum.

By 1860, foreign influences had to shape Guangdong&#x27;s dim sum with culinary innovations such as ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and curry, all of which came to be used in some savory dishes. Custard pies evolved into the miniature classics found in every teahouse. Other dim sum dishes evolved from Indian samosas, mango puddings, and Mexican conchas (snow-topped buns). Cantonese-style dim sum has an extremely broad range of tastes, textures, cooking styles, and ingredients. As a result, there are more than a thousand different varieties of dim sum.

During the 1920s, in Guangzhou, the foremost places to enjoy tea were its tea pavilions, which had refined and expansive surroundings. The customers were wealthy, and there were rather high standards for the privilege of enjoying tea pavilion service and dim sum. Upon entering a tea pavilion, customers would inspect tea leaves to ensure their quality and to verify the water temperature. Once satisfied, these guests were presented with a pencil and a booklet listing the available dim sum. A waiter would then tear their orders out of the booklet so that the kitchen could pan-fry, steam, bake, or deep-fry these dishes on demand. Customers dined upstairs in privacy and comfort. Servers carefully balanced the dishes on their arms or arranged them on trays as they climbed up and down the stairs. Eventually, dim sum carts were used to serve the steamers and plates.

People with average incomes also enjoyed tea and dim sum. Early every morning, customers visited inexpensive restaurants that offered filled steamed buns and hot tea. During the mid-morning, students and government employees ordered two or three kinds of dim sum and ate as they read their newspapers. In the late morning, people working at small businesses visited restaurants for breakfast and to use the restaurant as a small office space.

By the late 1930s, Guangzhou&#x27;s teahouse culture included four high-profile dim sum chefs, with signs at the front doors of their restaurants. There was heavy competition among teahouses, and as a result, new varieties of dim sum were invented almost daily, including dishes influenced by the tea pastries of Shanghai, Beijing, and the Western world. Many new fusion dishes were also created, including puddings, baked rolls, turnovers, custard tarts, and Malay steamed cakes.

There were also significant increases in the variety of thin wrappers used in both sweet and savory items.If we concentrate only on the changes and developments in the variety of wrappers, the main types of dim sum wrappers during the 1920s included such things as raised (for filled buns), wheat starch, &quot;shao mai&quot; (i.e., egg dough), crystal bun, crispy batter, sticky rice, and boiled dumpling wrappers. By the 1930s, the varieties of wrappers commonly used by chefs included puff pastry, Cantonese short pastry, and so on, for a total of 23 types that were prepared by pan-frying, deep-frying, steaming, baking, and roasting.As the Chinese Civil War progressed from 1927 to 1949, many dim sum chefs left China and settled in Hong Kong, resulting in further refinements and innovations of the dim sum there. Very large dim sum restaurants in major cities like Hong Kong, San Francisco, Boston, Toronto, and New York were also established.

In the nineteenth century, Cantonese immigrants brought dim sum to the west and east coasts of the United States. Some of the earliest dim sum restaurants in the U.S. still operating today opened in the 1920s in San Francisco and New York City. The history of San Francisco&#x27;s Chinese community is believed to have started about 30 years before the first dim sum restaurant opened in the city&#x27;s Chinatown neighborhood. The Chinese preferred to live in the present Chinatown area because of its restaurants and theatres. In the late 1930s, some early U.S. newspaper references to dim sum began to appear. While some Chinese restaurants in the U.S. had offered dim sum for decades, it was not until the late 1980s that there was a broader public awareness of dim sum.

Although there was increased awareness of dim sum around this time, one chef from Hong Kong, who immigrated to San Francisco, noted that diners in the U.S. usually focused on the food itself and not the communal aspects of eating dim sum. Although dim sum is a Chinese meal, it is a communal dining and social experience that can span hours. It is customary for large groups to enjoy dishes together as a leisurely social activity. Diners go to restaurants early, around 10:00 AM, and rather than ordering a whole table of food, they order small amounts, have a cup of tea, read the newspaper, and wait for friends and family to join them. As a result, a visit to a dim sum restaurant can last from late morning well into the afternoon. For some people in Hong Kong, eating dim sum is a daily routine and a way of life. Since this dim sum tradition is not always present in some U.S. dim sum restaurants, however, approaches to generate interest and attract customers include customized seasoning and flavors of traditional dishes, as well as creating novel dishes with an emphasis on enhanced flavors and visual appeal.

One food reviewer notes that there has been an increase in popularity in posting dim sum photos on social media feeds, and that dim sum has become so popular that every U.S. state now has at least one high-quality dim sum restaurant. There is a restaurant, bar, and highly rated dance club complex in Las Vegas, NV, that features high-end Cantonese food (including dim sum), craft cocktails, dinner parties, and prominent disc jockeys in a chic setting.

The dim sum restaurants in Chicago&#x27;s Chinatown serve mainly traditional dim sum dishes, but there has been recent growth in contemporary dim sum with new fusion dishes, as well as restaurants now located outside Chinatown.

In Hong Kong, many chefs are also introducing variants based on traditional Cantonese cuisine, which generates interest and provides both Hongkongers and tourists with new, fresh dim sum dishes.

== Modern dim sum ==
In addition to traditional dim sum, some chefs also create and prepare new fusion-based dim sum dishes. Modern versions of buns include pork belly steamed buns with cucumber, green onion, cilantro, and ginger hoisin sauce, cocoa mushroom buns, chili lamb buns. Dumplings include snow pea shoot and shrimp dumplings, and chili crab with fried garlic, &quot;siu mai&quot; with pork, shrimp, scallop, and caviar, dumplings stuffed with shrimp and peanut, dumplings with South Australian scallop, garoupa (grouper), caviar, gold leaf, and egg white, and bone marrow or beef short ribs in potstickers. Pastry puff dishes include Australian Wagyu beef puff, Assam curry chicken puff, and pumpkin puffs. Toast dishes include Hong Kong–style French toast with condensed milk and peanut butter and prawn toast. Additional examples are spring rolls filled with goat and duck skin and duck hearts cooked over a wood-fired grill and served with sesame-horseradish sauce.

One AAA four-diamond-award-winning Chinese restaurant in Miami Beach has a prix-fixe dim sum menu, prix-fixe &quot;yum cha&quot; menu and breakfast cocktails. Variations designed for visual appeal on social media, such as dumplings and buns made to resemble animals and fictional characters, also exist. Dim sum chefs have previously used cocoa powder as coloring to create steamed bread puffs to appear like forest mushrooms, espresso powder as both flavoring and coloring for deep-fried riblets, as well as pastry cream, and French puffs to create innovative dishes while paying tribute to the history of dim sum.

=== Fast food ===
Dim sum can often be purchased from grocery stores in major cities. They can be cooked easily by steaming, frying, or microwaving. Major grocery stores in Hong Kong, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Thailand, Australia, the United States and Canada stock a variety of frozen or fresh dim sum. These include dumplings, &quot;shumai&quot;, pork buns, and others.

In Hong Kong and other cities in Asia, dim sum can be purchased from convenience stores, coffee shops and other eateries. Halal-certified dim sum that uses chicken instead of pork is very popular in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei.
=== Restaurants ===
Some Cantonese restaurants serve dim sum as early as five in the morning, while more traditional restaurants typically serve dim sum from mid-morning until mid-afternoon. It is common for restaurants to serve dim sum during dinner as well as for takeout.

Dim sum is served using a unique serving method whereby servers offer dishes to customers from carts, including some carts that are steam-heated. Diners often prefer tables nearest the kitchen since servers and carts pass by these tables first. Many restaurants place lazy susans on tables to help diners reach food and tea.

The pricing of dishes at these types of restaurants may vary, but traditionally they are classified as &quot;small&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;large&quot;, &quot;extra-large&quot;, or &quot;special&quot;. Servers record orders with a rubber stamp or an ink pen on a bill card that remains on the table. Servers in some restaurants use distinctive stamps to track sales statistics for each server. When they have finished eating, the customer calls the server over, and their bill is calculated based on the number of stamps or quantities marked in each priced section.

Another way of pricing the food that was consumed uses the number and color of the dishes left on the table. Some restaurants offer a new approach by using a conveyor belt format.

Other Cantonese restaurants may take orders from a pre-printed sheet of paper and serve à la carte, much like Spanish tapas restaurants, to provide fresh, cooked-to-order dim sum or because of real estate and resource constraints.

<text>Glen Dee Hardin (born April 18, 1939) is an American piano player and arranger. He has performed and recorded with such artists as Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, Emmylou Harris, John Denver, and Ricky Nelson.

==Career==
Hardin was born in Wellington, Texas, a small town in the Texas panhandle. After getting out of the Navy in 1959, Hardin began his musical career in Long Beach, California, and soon joined the house band at the Palomino Club in North Hollywood, called &quot;Country Music&#x27;s most important West Coast club&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. It featured such performers as Buck Owens, Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Hoyt Axton and Willie Nelson and was also a popular hangout for other country entertainers such as Merle Haggard and Jerry Lee Lewis.

Shortly afterwards, he became a member of the Shindogs, the featured band on &quot;Shindig!&quot;, an American music variety show which aired on the ABC network from 1964 to 1966. The series house band, the Shin-diggers (later renamed the Shindogs), also featured a young Glen Campbell, James Burton, Billy Preston, Delaney Bramlett, Joey Cooper and Leon Russell. An early episode was taped in Britain with The Beatles as the guests. The series featured other &quot;British Invasion&quot; bands including the Who and the Rolling Stones. &quot;Shindig!&quot; would continue to broadcast episodes from London throughout its run. Many popular performers of the day played on the show including Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Lesley Gore, Bo Diddley and Sonny and Cher. It notably featured both black and white acts during a time of racial segregation in the United States.

A native of West Texas, Hardin had grown up with drummer Jerry Allison and bassist Joe B. Mauldin, both members of Buddy Holly&#x27;s band the Crickets. After Holly&#x27;s death in 1959, they continued to perform and record with guitarist/songwriter Sonny Curtis. During this period Hardin was made an honorary member of the Crickets and has played with them off and on for many years. Hardin found his first success as a songwriter in 1965 with &quot;Count Me In&quot;, recorded by Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys. &quot;Where Will The Words Come From&quot; and &quot;My Heart&#x27;s Symphony&quot; were also hits that Hardin penned for Lewis. He soon became an in-demand session pianist and over the years has recorded with numerous artists in a variety of music genres including Bing Crosby, Nancy Sinatra, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Buck Owens, John Denver, Linda Ronstadt, Kenny Rogers, Johnny Rivers, Merle Haggard, Michael Nesmith, Waylon Jennings, and Dwight Yoakam.

In 1970 Hardin got a call from Elvis Presley to replace Larry Muhoberac in the TCB Band, featuring James Burton, Jerry Scheff and Ron Tutt. Hardin remained with the band until 1976, touring and recording with Presley and appearing in the &quot;Aloha From Hawaii&quot; TV special. Hardin studied arranging and arranged many of Presley&#x27;s hits such as &quot;The Wonder of You&quot;, &quot;Let It Be Me&quot; and &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Help Believin&#x27;&quot;. This high-profile position soon led to many other opportunities. In 1972 Gram Parsons, one of the founders of country rock, hired the TCB Band to record his first album, GP. Hardin played piano and was musical director on the sessions for this as well as Parsons&#x27; second album, Grievous Angel. Through his work with Parsons, Hardin was introduced to Emmylou Harris, with whom he would work after Parsons&#x27; death in the highly praised and influential Hot Band. Across several years this band included James Burton, John Ware, Rodney Crowell, Hank DeVito, Emory Gordy, Jr., Albert Lee, Larrie Londin and Ricky Skaggs. Hardin also played piano on the Roy Orbison television special, &quot;A Black and White Night&quot;.

== Recent activity ==

Hardin toured in Sweden with the Cadillac band in 2007 and 2008.
Hardin continues to tour, regularly performing in Europe. In June 2009 he played Breda in the Netherlands. In January 2010, Hardin went into RCA Studio B in Nashville with the Dutch singer Bouke. Bouke is the winner of the Dutch national TV show &quot;Waar Is Elvis&quot; (Where Is Elvis). They recorded three songs together for a CD distributed among the Dutch and Belgian members of the Elvis Matters fanclub.

<doc id="100646" wikidata="Q916415" url="?curid=100646" title="Full-spectrum dominance">
<text>Full-spectrum dominance also known as full-spectrum superiority, is a military entity&#x27;s achievement of control over all dimensions of the battlespace, effectively possessing an overwhelming diversity of resources in such areas as terrestrial, aerial, maritime, subterranean, extraterrestrial, psychological, and bio- or cyber-technological warfare.

Full spectrum dominance includes the physical battlespace; air, surface and sub-surface as well as the electromagnetic spectrum and information space. Control implies that freedom of opposition force assets to exploit the battlespace is wholly constrained.

==US military doctrine==
As early as April 2001 the United States Department of Defense defined &quot;full-spectrum superiority&quot; (FSS) as:
:The cumulative effect of dominance in the air, land, maritime, and space domains and information environment, which includes cyberspace, that permits the conduct of joint operations without effective opposition or prohibitive interference.

The doctrine of Full Spectrum Operations replaced the prior one, which was known as AirLand Battle. AirLand Battle had been taught in one form or another since 1982.

The United States military&#x27;s doctrine espoused a strategic intent to be capable of achieving FSS state in a conflict, either alone or with allies, by defeating any adversary and controlling any situation across the range of military operations.

The stated intent implies significant investment in a range of capabilities: dominant maneuver, precision engagement, focused logistics, and full-dimensional protection.

==Criticism==

Critics of US imperialism have referred to the term as proof of the ambitions of policymakers in the US and their alleged desire for total control. Harold Pinter referred to the term in his 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature acceptance speech &quot;Art, Truth and Politics&quot;:

I have said earlier that the United States is now totally frank about putting its cards on the table. That is the case. Its official declared policy is now defined as &quot;full spectrum dominance&quot;. That is not my term, it is theirs. &quot;Full spectrum dominance&quot; means control of land, sea, air and space and all attendant resources.
==Metaphorical use==
Full spectrum dominance is used in a number of non-military fields to describe a comprehensive tactical effort to support a strategy.

In marketing, full spectrum dominance may refer to an integrated campaign that takes into account reaching an audience across a wide variety of platforms and media to guarantee visibility and reinforcement. That might include simultaneous integration of online promotions with direct marketing, public relations, social media and other tactical marketing vehicles.

<text>Heidelberg University, officially the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg (; ), is a public research university in Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany&#x27;s oldest university and one of the world&#x27;s oldest surviving universities; it was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire after Prague (1347) and Vienna (1365). Since 1899, it has been a coeducational institution.

Heidelberg is one of the most prestigious universities in Germany. It is a German Excellence University, part of the U15, as well as a founding member of the League of European Research Universities and the Coimbra Group. The university consists of twelve faculties and offers degree programmes at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in some 100 disciplines. The language of instruction is usually German, while a considerable number of graduate degrees are offered in English as well as some in French.

 57 Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with the city of Heidelberg and 33 with the university itself. Modern scientific psychiatry, psychopharmacology, experimental psychology, psychiatric genetics, mathematical statistics, environmental physics, and modern sociology were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg students or faculty. Approximately 1,000 doctorates are completed every year, with more than one third of the doctoral students coming from abroad. International students from some 130 countries account for more than 20 percent of the entire student body.

==History==
===Founding===
The Great Schism of 1378 made it possible for Heidelberg, a relatively small city and capital of the Electorate of the Palatinate, to gain its own university. The Great Schism was initiated by the election of two popes after the death of Pope Gregory XI in the same year. One successor resided in Avignon (elected by the French) and the other in Rome (elected by the Italian cardinals). The German secular and spiritual leaders voiced their support for the successor in Rome, which had far-reaching consequences for the German students and teachers in Paris: they lost their stipends and had to leave.

Rupert I recognized the opportunity and initiated talks with the Curia, which ultimately led to a papal bull for foundation of a university. After having received, on 23 October 1385, permission from pope Urban VI to create a school of general studies (), the final decision to found the university was taken on 26 June 1386 at the behest of Rupert I, Count Palatine of the Rhine. As specified in the papal charter, the university was modelled after the University of Paris and included four faculties: philosophy, theology, jurisprudence, and medicine.

On 18 October 1386 a special Pontifical High Mass in the &quot;Heiliggeistkirche&quot; was the ceremony that established the university. On 19 October 1386 the first lecture was held, making Heidelberg the oldest university in Germany. In November 1386, Marsilius of Inghen was elected first rector of the university. The rector seal motto was &quot;semper apertus&quot;—i.e., &quot;the book of learning is always open.&quot; The university grew quickly and in March 1390, 185 students were enrolled at the university.

===Late Middle Ages===
Between 1414 and 1418, theology and jurisprudence professors of the university took part in the Council of Constance and acted as counselors for Louis III, who attended this council as representative of the emperor and chief magistrate of the realm. This resulted in establishing a good reputation for the university and its professors.

Due to the influence of Marsilius, the university initially taught the nominalism or &quot;via moderna&quot;. In 1412, both realism and the teachings of John Wycliffe were forbidden at the university but later, around 1454, the university decided that realism or &quot;via antique&quot; would also be taught, thus introducing two parallel ways ().

The transition from scholastic to humanistic culture was effected by the chancellor and bishop Johann von Dalberg in the late 15th century. Humanism was represented at Heidelberg University particularly by the founder of the older German Humanistic School Rudolph Agricola, Conrad Celtes, Jakob Wimpfeling, and Johann Reuchlin. Æneas Silvius Piccolomini was chancellor of the university in his capacity as provost of Worms, and later always favored it with his friendship and good-will as Pope Pius II. In 1482, Pope Sixtus IV permitted laymen and married men to be appointed professors in the ordinary of medicine through a papal dispensation. In 1553, Pope Julius III sanctioned the allotment of ecclesiastical benefices to secular professors.

=== Reformation and modern era ===
Martin Luther&#x27;s disputation at Heidelberg in April 1518 made a lasting impact, and his adherents among the masters and scholars soon became leading Reformationists in Southwest Germany. With the Electorate of the Palatinate turn to the Reformed faith, Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, converted the university into a calvinistic institution. In 1563, the Heidelberg Catechism was created under collaboration of members of the university&#x27;s divinity school.

As the 16th century was passing, the late humanism stepped beside Calvinism as a predominant school of thought; and figures like Paul Schede, Jan Gruter, Martin Opitz, and Matthäus Merian taught at the university. It attracted scholars from all over the continent and developed into a cultural and academic center. However, with the beginning of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1618, the intellectual and fiscal wealth of the university declined. In 1622, the then-world-famous Bibliotheca Palatina (the library of the university) was stolen from the University Cathedral and taken to Rome. The reconstruction efforts thereafter were defeated by the troops of King Louis XIV, who destroyed Heidelberg in 1693 almost completely.

As a consequence of the late Counter-Reformation, the university lost its Protestant character, and was channeled by Jesuits. From 1712 to 1728, the Old University was constructed at University Square, then known as Domus Wilhelmina. Through the efforts of the Jesuits a preparatory seminary was established, the Seminarium ad Carolum Borromæum, whose pupils were also registered in the university. After the suppression of the Jesuit Order, most of the schools they had conducted passed into the hands of the French Congregation of Lazarists in 1773. They deteriorated from that time forward.

Meanwhile, the university itself continued to lose in prestige until the reign of the last elector Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine, who established new chairs for all the faculties, founded scientific institutes such as the Electoral Academy of Science, and transferred the school of political economy from Kaiserslautern to Heidelberg, where it was combined with the university as the faculty of political economy. He also founded an observatory in the neighboring city of Mannheim, where Jesuit Christian Mayer labored as director. In connection with the four hundredth anniversary of the university, the elector approved a revised statute book that several professors had been commissioned to prepare. The financial affairs of the university, its receipts and expenditures, were put in order. At that time, the number of students varied from 300 to 400; in the jubilee year, 133 matriculated.

As a consequence of the disturbances caused by the French Revolution, and particularly because of the Treaty of Lunéville, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the Rhine, so that its complete dissolution was expected.

===19th and early 20th century===
This decline did not stop until 1803, when the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden, to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted. Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade, Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph Görres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.

The German Students Association exerted great influence, which was at first patriotic and later political. After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of Liberalism and the movement in favor of German national unity. The historians Friedrich Christoph Schlosser and Georg Gottfried Gervinus were the guides of the nation in political history. The modern scientific schools of medicine and natural science, particularly astronomy, were models in point of construction and equipment, and Heidelberg University was especially noted for its influential law school. The university as a whole became the role model for the transformation of American liberal arts colleges into research universities, in particular for the then-newly established Johns Hopkins University. Heidelberg&#x27;s professors were important supporters of the Vormärz revolution and many of them were members of the first freely elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. During the late 19th century, the university housed a very liberal and open-minded spirit, which was deliberately fostered by Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch and a circle of colleagues around them.

In February 1900, the Grand Duchy of Baden issued a decree that gave women the right to access universities in Baden. Thus, the universities of Freiburg and Heidelberg were the first ones to allow women to study.

In the Weimar Republic, the university was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber. Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard was head of the physics institute at the time. Following the assassination of the liberal German-Jewish Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, he refused to half mast the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.

===Nazi Germany===

After the establishment of Nazi Germany in 1933, the university supported Adolf Hitler and the Nazis like all other German universities at the time. It dismissed a large number of staff and students for political and racial reasons. Many dissident fellows had to emigrate and most Jewish and Communist professors who did not leave Germany were deported. At least two professors directly fell victim to Nazi terror. On 17 May 1933, members of the university faculty and students took part in book burnings at &quot;Universitätsplatz&quot; (&#x27;University Square&#x27;) and Heidelberg eventually became infamous as a NSDAP university. The inscription above the main entrance of the New University was changed from &quot;The Living Spirit&quot; to &quot;The German Spirit&quot;, and many professors paid homage to the new motto. The university was involved in Nazi eugenics: forced sterilizations were carried out at the women&#x27;s clinic and the psychiatric clinic, then directed by Carl Schneider, was involved in Action T4 Euthanasia program.

The heads of the university helped in the deportation of Jewish men, women and children directly to the gas chambers.

After the end of World War II, the university underwent an extensive denazification.

===Federal Republic of Germany===
Since Heidelberg was spared from destruction during World War II, the reconstruction of the university was realized rather quickly. With the foundation of the Collegium Academicum, Heidelberg University became the home of Germany&#x27;s first and, until today, only self-governed student hall. Newly laid statutes obliged the university to &quot;The Living Spirit of Truth, Justice and Humanity&quot;.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the university grew dramatically in size. At this time, it developed into one of the main scenes of the left-wing student protests in Germany. In 1975, a massive police force arrested the entire student parliament AStA. Shortly thereafter, the building of the Collegium Academicum, a progressive college in immediate vicinity to the university&#x27;s main grounds, was stormed by over 700 police officers and closed once and for all. On the outskirts of the city, in the Neuenheimer Feld area, a large campus for medicine and natural sciences was constructed.

Today, about 29,000 students are enrolled for studies at Heidelberg University. There are 4,196 full-time faculty, including 476 university professors. In 2007, and again in 2012, the university was appointed &quot;University of Excellence&quot; under an initiative started by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Research Foundation. This enhanced the German university system by establishing a small network of exceptionally well-funded universities, which are expected to generate strong international appeal.

In 2022, a mass shooting occurred in the university, killing a woman and injuring three other people. The gunman then committed suicide.

==Campuses==


Heidelberg is a city with approximately 140,000 inhabitants. It is situated in the Rhine Neckar Triangle, a European metropolitan area with approximately 2.4 million people living there, comprising the neighboring cities of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Ludwigshafen, and a number of smaller towns in the perimeter. Heidelberg is known as the cradle of Romanticism, and its old town and castle are among the most frequented tourist destinations in Germany. Its pedestrian zone is a shopping and night life magnet for the surrounding area and beyond. Heidelberg is about 40 minutes by train away from Frankfurt International Airport.
Heidelberg University&#x27;s facilities are, generally speaking, separated in two parts. The faculties and institutes of humanities and social sciences are embedded in the Old Town Campus. The sciences faculties and the medical school, including three large university hospitals, are located on the New Campus in the Neuenheimer Feld on the outskirts of Heidelberg.

===Old Town Campus===
The so-called New University is regarded as the center of the Old Town Campus. It is situated at the &quot;Universitätsplatz&quot; (University Square) in the pedestrian zone, in direct vicinity to the University Library and to the main administration buildings. The New University was officially opened in 1931. Its erection was largely financed by donations of wealthy American families, in line with a fundraising campaign of Jacob Gould Schurman, an alumnus of Heidelberg University and former United States Ambassador to Germany. It houses the new assembly hall, the largest lecture halls, and a number of smaller seminar rooms, mostly used by faculties of humanities and social sciences. Education in humanities and social sciences takes place to a great extent in buildings spread over the ancient part of town, though most are less than ten minutes walk from University Square. The faculties maintain their own extensive libraries and work spaces for students. Seminars and tutorials are usually held in the faculty buildings.

===Neuenheimer Feld – New Campus===


In the 1960s the university started building a new campus near the city district Neuenheim, called the Neuenheimer Feld. It is today the largest part of the university, and the largest campus for natural sciences and life science in Germany. Almost all science faculties and institutes, the medical school, University Hospital Heidelberg, and the science branch of the University Library are situated on the New Campus. Most of the dormitories and the athletic facilities of the university can be found there as well.

Several independent research institutes, such as the German Cancer Research Center and two of the Max-Planck-Institutes have settled there. The New Campus is also the seat of several biomedical spin-off companies. The old part of town can be reached by tram and bus in about 10 minutes. The Neuenheimer Feld campus has extensive parking lots for faculty and student vehicles for long term and short term parking, as well as visitors and patients of the various university hospitals. The Faculty of Physics and Astronomy is not located on either campus, but on the Philosophers&#x27; Walk, separated from the Old Town by the River Neckar, and some away from the New Campus. It also maintains observatory facilities on the Königstuhl Mountain.

The university maintains a botanical garden at Neuenheimer Feld.

===Bergheim Campus===
The Bergheim Campus is located in the former Ludolf Krehl clinic (named after Ludolf von Krehl) in the inner-city suburb of Heidelberg-Bergheim. Since March 2009 it has housed the institutes economics, political science, and sociology (together the Heidelberg University Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences) that formerly resided at the Old Town campus. The Bergheim campus offers one lecture theatre, several seminar rooms, the most modern of the university libraries, and a cafe (rather than the full cafeteria present in the other campuses). Since 2019, the Bergheim Campus has also become the location of the Centre for Asian and Transcultural Studies of the Heidelberg University.

===Libraries===


The University Library is the main library of the university. Together with the branch libraries, serving the faculties and institutes, it forms the integral university library system comprising approximately 6.2 million printed volumes. The University Library&#x27;s holdings exceeded one million in 1934. Today, it comprises about 3.2 million books, about 500,000 other media such as microfilms and video tapes, as well as 6,000 printed scientific periodicals. Moreover, it has 6,900 manuscripts, 1,800 incunabula, 110,500 autographs, and a collection of old maps, paintings, and photographs. Furthermore, the 38 branch libraries add another 3.0 million printed books. In 2022, 43,600 active users accessed 746,000 books. Additionally, the University Library provides a wide array of online resources, among them 152,000 scientific e-journals.

The origins of today&#x27;s University Library date back to 1386, the year the university was founded. Surrounding the new university, the libraries of the faculty of the arts, the three higher faculties (theology, law, medicine) and the collegiate library grew. The acquisition of a box of records, which was housed in the Heiliggeistkirche, through the rector, Marsilius of Inghen, in 1388 contributed fundamentally to the development of the library. In the 16th century, Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, combined the miscellaneous book collections accrued since the foundation of the university with the princely library housed in Heidelberg Castle to form the Bibliotheca Palatina and made them publicly accessible in the galleries of the Heiliggeistkirche. Among these collections, inherited records of the Fuggers (Augsburg, Ulrich Fugger the Elder) wereof particular importance. The majority of the library holdings, which enjoyed great contemporary renown, was looted during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, transported to Rome and was gifted to Pope Gregory XV by the victorious Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria in 1622. After the secularization in 1804, the holdings of the monasteries of Salem and Petershausen formed the foundation of the reconstruction of the library collection in the 19th century. In 1816, 847 German-language manuscripts from the Bibliotheca Palatina returned to Heidelberg. As part of an exchange, the Codex Manesse, which had ended up in the Royal Library in Paris, followed in 1888. Karl Zangemeister (1837–1902) became the first full-time head of the university library in 1912. Based on the designs of architect Joseph Durum, a dedicated library building, a richly ornamented, four-winged red sandstone construction, was erected from 1901 to 1905. In 1978, a branch library opened in the Neuenheimer Feld, serving the institutes of natural sciences and medicine.

Since 2021, all manuscripts of the Bibliotheca Palatina are accessible digitally online (848 German-language Palatina manuscripts, 2,030 Latin, 423 Greek, 267 Hebrew and 20 manuscripts in other languages). Their digitization was achieved through the cooperation of Heidelberg University Library and the Vatican Library.

The university library expands its publication services: The Heidelberg document server heiDOK is an open access platform for members of the university. The university bibliography heiBIB lists all academic publications by university members. In 2015, Heidelberg University founded the publishing house Heidelberg University Publishing – heiUP, which is part of the university library. The publisher releases quality-controlled scientific publications in open access.

===Facilities abroad===
Heidelberg University founded a Center for Latin America in Santiago, Chile in 2001. It has the task of organizing, managing, and marketing the courses of study maintained either independently by Heidelberg University or in cooperation with the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chile. The center has responsibility for programs of postgraduate education. It also coordinates the activities of Heidelberg University in Latin America, and provides a platform for scientific cooperation. Heidelberg University&#x27;s South Asia Institute maintains branch offices in New Delhi (India), Islamabad (Pakistan), Kathmandu (Nepal), and Colombo (Sri Lanka).

The university is also represented by a liaison office in New York. Its main tasks include promoting existing collaborations, building up new networks, creating joint study programs, and maintaining and expanding academic contacts with American universities.

=== Museum ===
The university has its own museum, in the main building of the old campus. Visitors are able to view the Great Hall (when not in use), and the former &quot;student jail&quot;.

==Organization==

===Governance===
The Rectorate is the &#x27;executive body&#x27; of the university, headed by rector Prof. Dr. Frauke Melchior. The rectorate consists of the chancellor, Holger Schroeter, who is the head of the central administration and responsible for the university&#x27;s budgeting, and three pro-rectors, who are responsible for international relations, teaching and communication, and research and structure respectively.

The Senate is the &#x27;legislative branch&#x27; of the university. The rector and the members of the rectorate are senators &quot;ex officio&quot;, as are also the deans of the faculties, as well as the medical and managing directors of the University Hospital, and the university&#x27;s equal opportunities officer. Another 20 senators are elected for four-year terms, within the following quotas: eight university professors; four academic staff; four delegates of the student body; and four employees of the university administration.

The University Council is the advisory board to the aforementioned entities and encompasses, among others, the former Israeli Ambassador to Germany Avi Primor, as well as CEOs of German industries.

===Faculties===
After a 2003 structural reformation, the university consists of 13 faculties, which in turn comprise several disciplines, departments, and institutes. As a consequence of the Bologna process, most faculties now offer Bachelor&#x27;s, Master&#x27;s, and Ph.D. degrees to comply with the new European degree standard. Notable exceptions are the undergraduate programs in law, medicine, dentistry and pharmacy, from which students still graduate with the State Examination, a central examination at Master&#x27;s level held by the State of Baden-Württemberg.

In 2007, the university awarded 994 PhD degrees.

===Rankings===
In the 2025 edition of the QS World University Rankings, Heidelberg ranked 84th globally and 3rd in Germany. According to the 2024 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the university was ranked 47th in the world and held the position as the 3rd best university in the country. Moreover, in the 2023 ARWU World Rankings, Heidelberg secured the 55th position worldwide and was ranked first nationally.

According to the funding report of the German Research Foundation (DFG) of 2018, which breaks down the grants from 2014 to 2016, the Heidelberg University ranked 2nd among German universities in the overall ranking, 7th in humanities and social sciences and 4th among German universities in the life sciences and natural sciences. The approvals were normalised to the size of the university. In a competitive selection process, the DFG selects the best research projects from researchers at universities and research institutes and finances them. The ranking is thus regarded as an indicator of the quality of research.

In the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities (NTU ranking) 2019, which measures the research outputs of universities, Heidelberg University is ranked 1st in Germany and 5th in Continental Europe.

In the CWTS Leiden Ranking 2019 Heidelberg University is ranked 1st in Germany and 13th in Continental Europe over all sciences according to the scientific impact (number of publications in core journals). According to the indicator &quot;Collaboration&quot;, Heidelberg University is 1st in Germany and 10th in Europe.

Ranked by the number of Nobel Laureates affiliated with the university at the time of Nobel Prize announcement, Heidelberg was placed 1st in Germany, 4th in Europe and 13th in the world by 2013.

According to the Third European Report on Science &amp; Technology Indicators compiled by the European Commission, Heidelberg ranked 4th nationally and 9th in Europe.

The German Center for Higher Education Development Excellence Ranking 2010, which measures academic performance of European graduate programs in biology, chemistry, economics, mathematics, physics, political sciences, and psychology, placed Heidelberg in the European excellence group for biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and psychology.

Measured by the number of top managers in the German economy, Heidelberg University ranked 53rd in 2019.



===Organisation and length of courses===
The academic year is divided into two semesters. The winter semester runs from 1 October to 31 March and the summer semester from 1 April to 30 September. Classes are held from mid-October to mid-February and mid-April to mid-July. Students can generally begin their studies either in the winter or the summer semester. However, there are several subjects students can begin only in the winter semester. The standard time required to finish a Bachelor&#x27;s degree is principally six semesters, and a further four semesters for consecutive Master&#x27;s degrees. The normal duration of PhD programmes for full-time students is 6 semesters. The overall period of study for an undergraduate degree is divided into two parts: a period of basic study, lasting at least four semesters, at the end of which students must sit a formal examination, and a period of advanced study, lasting at least two semesters, after which students take their final examinations.

===Admission===
In the winter-semester 2006/2007, the university offered 3,926 places in undergraduate programs restricted by numerus clausus, with an overall acceptance rate of 16.3%. Most selective are the undergraduate programs in clinical medicine, molecular biotechnology, political science, and law, with acceptance rates of 3.6%, 3.8%, 7.6% and 9.1% respectively. The selection is exercised by allocating the best qualified applicants to a given number of places available in the respective discipline, thus depending primarily on the chosen subjects and the grade point average of the Abitur or its equivalent. For some majors and minors in humanities—particularly for conceptually non-vocational like classics and ancient history—unrestricted admission is granted under certain criteria (e.g., relevant language proficiency), as applications regularly do not exceed the number of places available.

For prospective international undergraduate students, a language test for German—such as the DSH—is required. Admission to consecutive Master&#x27;s programs always requires at least an undergraduate degree equivalent to the German grade &quot;good&quot; (i.e., normally B+ in American, or 2:1 in British terms). Except for the Master&#x27;s programs taught in English, a language test for German must be passed as well. PhD admission prerequisite is normally a strong Master&#x27;s-level degree, but specific admission procedures vary and cannot be generalized. International applicants usually make up considerably more than 20% of the applicant pool and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective country of origin.

===Finances===
The German state heavily subsidizes university study to keep higher education affordable regardless of socio-economic background.
From 2007 to 2012, Heidelberg has charged tuition fees of approximately €1,200 p.a. for undergraduate, consecutive Master&#x27;s, and doctoral programs, for both EU and non-EU citizens, and for any subject area. However, from spring term 2012 onwards, tuition fees have been abolished. The usual housing costs for on-campus dormitories range from €2,200 to €3,000 p.a.

In the fiscal year 2005, Heidelberg University had an overall operating budget of approximately €856 M, consisting of approximately €413 M government funds, approximately €311 M basic budget, and approximately €132 M from external grants. The university spent approximately €529 M in payroll costs and approximately €326 M in other expenditures. Additionally, the university receives another €150 M in research grants, distributed over 5 years from 2012 onwards, due to the German Universities Excellence Initiative. In the fiscal year 2007, the university for the first time raised approximately €19 M through tuition fees, exclusively to further improve the conditions of study. Only approximately €9.5 M of these were spent at the end of the year and the rectorate had to urge the faculties to make use of their additional means.

===Research===
Among historical scientific achievements of Heidelberg researchers features prominently the invention of spectroscopy, and of the Bunsen burner; the discovery of chemical elements Caesium and Rubidium; the identification of the absolute point of ebullition; and the identification and isolation of nicotine as the main pharmacologically active component of tobacco. Modern scientific psychiatry; psychopharmacology; psychiatric genetics; environmental physics; and modern sociology were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg faculty. Almost 800 dwarf planets, the North America Nebula, and the return of Halley&#x27;s Comet have been discovered and documented at institutes of the Heidelberg Center for Astronomy. Moreover, Heidelberg researchers invented the process of plastination to preserve body tissue, conducted the first successful transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells, and recently developed a new strategy for a vaccination against certain forms of cancer, which earned Harald zur Hausen of the university the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008.

Today, the university puts an emphasis on natural sciences and medicine, but it retains its traditions with highly ranked faculties of humanities and social sciences. The &quot;Marsilius Kolleg&quot;, named after Marsilius of Inghen, was established in 2007 as a Center for Advanced Study to promote interdisciplinary dialogue and research especially between the sciences and the humanities. Other institutes such as the &quot;Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing&quot;, the &quot;Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences&quot;, the &quot;Heidelberg Center for American Studies&quot;, and the &quot;South Asia Institute&quot; also build a bridge between faculties and thus emphasize the concept of a comprehensive university.

Noted regular publications of the Center for Astronomy include the Gliese catalogue of nearby stars, the fundamental catalogues FK5 and FK6 and the annual published Apparent places, a high precision catalog with pre-calculated positions for over 3,000 stars for each day. The Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research publishes the annual Conflict Barometer, which describes the recent trends in global conflict developments, escalations, de-escalations, and settlements. Regular publications by the Max Planck Institute for International Law include the &quot;Heidelberg Journal of International Law&quot;, the &quot;Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law&quot;; the &quot;Journal of the History of International Law&quot;; the &quot;Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law&quot;; and the semi-annual bibliography &quot;Public International Law&quot;.

The German Research Foundation (DFG) currently funds twelve long-term Collaborative Research Centers (SFB) with a duration of up to 12 years at Heidelberg, four Priority Programs (SPP) with a duration of six years, two Research Units (FOR) with a duration of up to six years, as well as numerous individual projects at the university&#x27;s faculties and institutes. As a result of the German Universities Excellence Initiative, two Clusters of Excellence are funded with €6.5 M each—&quot;Cellular Networks: From Molecular Mechanisms to Quantitative Understanding of Complex Functions&quot;, and &quot;Asia and Europe in a Global Context&quot;.

===International cooperations===
Heidelberg is a founding member of the League of European Research Universities, the Coimbra Group, and the European University Association. The university forms part of the German-Japanese University Consortium HeKKSaGOn, and it participates in 7 European exchange schemes for researchers and students, such as ERASMUS. Furthermore, it is actively involved in the development of the German-speaking Andrássy University of Budapest, and co-runs the school of German law at the Jagiellonian University of Kraków. The city of Heidelberg being twinned with Cambridge, England, and Montpellier, France, there are close academic ties to the University of Cambridge and the Université de Montpellier. Beyond Europe, the university and its faculties maintain specific agreements with 58 partner universities in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia and the Russian Federation. In total, the Higher Education Compass of the German Rector&#x27;s Conference lists staff and student exchange agreements as well as research cooperations with 236 universities worldwide. Some of the most notable partner universities include Cornell University, Duke University, Georgetown University, Harvard University, Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po), Pantheon Sorbonne University, University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, Tsinghua University, and Yale University.

==Student life==
===Sports===
The university offers a broad variety of athletics, such as teams in 16 different court sports from American football to volleyball, courses in 11 different martial arts, 26 courses in physical fitness and body building, 9 courses in health sports from aquapower to yoga, and groups in 12 different dance styles. Moreover, equestrian sports, sailing, rowing, skiing in the French Alps, track and field, swimming, fencing, cycling, acrobatics, gymnastics, and much more. Most of the sports are free of charge. Heidelberg&#x27;s competition teams are particularly successful in soccer, volleyball, equestrian sports, judo, karate, track and field, and basketball. The University Sports Club men&#x27;s basketball team, USC Heidelberg, is the championship record holder, won 13 national championships, and is the only university team playing at a professional level in the second division of Germany&#x27;s national league.

===Groups===
Moreover, the university supports a number of student groups in various fields of interest. Among them are four drama clubs, the university orchestra Collegium Musicum, four choirs, six student media groups, six groups of international students, nine groups of political parties and NGO&#x27;s, several departments of European organizations of students in certain disciplines, four clubs dedicated to fostering international relations and cultural exchange, a chess club, a literature club, two debate societies (one focused on English debating, the other focused on German debating), one student consulting group, and four religious student groups. Student unions structure themselves as &quot;Studierendenrat&quot; (Student body council) as well as on department level.

===Media===
Heidelberg&#x27;s student newspaper &quot;ruprecht&quot; is—with editions of more than 10,000 copies—one of Germany&#x27;s largest student-run newspapers. It was recently distinguished by the MLP Pro Campus Press Award as Germany&#x27;s best student newspaper. The jury of journalists from major newspapers commended its &quot;well balanced, though critical attitude&quot; and its &quot;simply great&quot; layout that &quot;suffices highest professional demands.&quot; The ruprecht is financed entirely by advertising revenues, thus retaining independence from university management. Some renowned journalists emerged from &quot;ruprecht&quot;″s editorial board.

However, the critical online student newspaper &quot;UNiMUT&quot;, which is run by the joint student council of the faculties, criticized the &quot;ruprecht&quot; often for being conformed, and exceedingly layout-oriented.

Heidelberg is also home of Germany&#x27;s oldest student law review &quot;Heidelberg Law Review&quot;. The journal is published quarterly, at the beginning and end of each semester break, and is circulated throughout all of Germany.

===Studentenverbindung===
Heidelberg hosts 34 student corporations, which were largely founded in the 19th century. Corporations are to some extent comparable to the fraternities in the US. As traditional symbols (couleur) corporation members wear colored caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (&quot;Kommers&quot;) and some still practice the traditional academic fencing, a kind of duel, to &quot;shape their members for the challenges of life.&quot; In the 19th and early 20th century, corporations played an important role in Germany&#x27;s student life. Today, however, corporations include only a relatively small number of students. Their self-declared mission is to keep academic traditions alive and to create friendships for life. The corporations&#x27; often representative 19th-century mansions are present throughout the Old Town.

===Nightlife===
Heidelberg is not least famous for its student night life. Besides the various parties regularly organized by the student councils of the faculties, the semester opening and closing parties of the university, the dormitory parties, and the soirées of Heidelberg&#x27;s 34 student fraternities, the city offers night life for any taste and budget.

==Notable alumni==


Alumni and faculty of the university include many founders and pioneers of academic disciplines, and a large number of internationally acclaimed philosophers, poets, jurisprudents, theologians, natural and social scientists. 33 Nobel Laureates, at least 18 Leibniz laureates, and two &quot;Oscar&quot; winners have been associated with Heidelberg University. Nine Nobel laureates received the award during their tenure at Heidelberg.

Besides several federal ministers of Germany and prime ministers of German states, five chancellors of Germany have attended the university, the latest being Helmut Kohl, the &quot;Chancellor of the Reunification&quot;. Heads of state or government of Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Nicaragua, Serbia, Thailand, a British heir apparent, a secretary general of NATO and a director of the International Peace Bureau have also been educated at Heidelberg; among them Nobel Peace laureates Charles Albert Gobat and Auguste Beernaert. Former university affiliates in the field of religion include Pope Pius II, cardinals, bishops, and with Philipp Melanchthon and Zacharias Ursinus, two key leaders of the Protestant Reformation.

Park and Talcott Parsons.

Philosophers Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Jaspers, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Jürgen Habermas served as university professors, as did also the pioneering scientists Hermann von Helmholtz, Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, Emil Kraepelin, the founder of scientific psychiatry, and outstanding social scientists such as Max Weber, the founding father of modern sociology.

Present faculty include Medicine Nobel Laureates Bert Sakmann (1991) and Harald zur Hausen (2008), Chemistry Nobel Laureate Stefan Hell (2014), seven Leibniz laureates, former justice of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany Paul Kirchhof, and Rüdiger Wolfrum, the former president of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.

==In fiction and popular culture==

=== Literature ===
In 1880 Mark Twain humorously detailed his impressions of Heidelberg&#x27;s student life in &quot;A Tramp Abroad&quot;. He painted a picture of the university as a school for aristocrats, where students pursued a dandy&#x27;s lifestyle, and described the great influence the student corporations exerted on the whole of Heidelberg&#x27;s student life.

In William Somerset Maugham&#x27;s 1915 masterpiece novel &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, he described the one-year stay of the protagonist Philip Carey at Heidelberg University, in a largely autobiographical way. Heidelberg also featured in the respective film versions of the novel, released in 1934 (starring Leslie Howard as Philip, and Bette Davis as Mildred), 1946 (with Paul Henreid and Eleanor Parker in the lead roles), and 1964 (with Laurence Harvey and Kim Novak in the lead roles).

E. C. Gordon, the hero of Robert Heinlein&#x27;s 1964 novel &quot;Glory Road&quot;, mentions his desire for a degree from Heidelberg and the dueling scars to go with it.

In Bernhard Schlink&#x27;s semi-autobiographical 1995 novel &quot;The Reader&quot;, Heidelberg University is one of the main scenes of Part II. Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, Michael Berg, a law student at the university, re-encounters his former lover as she defends herself in a war-crimes trial, which he observes as part of a seminar. The university is also featured in the Academy Award-winning 2008 film version The Reader, starring Kate Winslet, David Kross and Ralph Fiennes.

=== Film and television ===
The 1927 silent film &quot;The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg&quot;, based on Wilhelm Meyer-Förster&#x27;s play &quot;Alt Heidelberg&quot; (1903), starring Ramón Novarro and Norma Shearer, continued Mark Twain&#x27;s image of Heidelberg, showing the story of a German prince who comes to Heidelberg to study there, but falls in love with his innkeeper&#x27;s daughter. Having been very popular in the first half of the 20th century, it presents the typical student life of the 19th and early 20th century, and it is today considered a masterpiece of the late silent film era. MGM&#x27;s 1954 color remake &quot;The Student Prince&quot;, featuring the voice of Mario Lanza, is based on Sigmund Romberg&#x27;s operetta version of the story. In 2000, a film named Anatomy (film) with Franka Potente was set at Heidelberg and involved a secret society called the Anti-Hyppocratic Society.

<text>Baol or Bawol was a kingdom in what is now central Senegal. Founded in the 11th century, it was a vassal of the Jolof Empire before becoming independent in the mid-16th century. The ruler bore the title of Teigne (or Teeň) and reigned from the capital in Lambaye. The kingdom encompassed a strip of land extending east from the ocean and included the towns of Touba, Diourbel, and Mbacke. It was directly south of the Kingdom of Cayor and north of the Kingdom of Sine.

==History==
There are no written sources for the early history of Baol, and even oral traditions are sparse. The earliest recorded Teigne of Baol was named Kayamangha Diatta and was a member of the Soninke Wagadu matrilineage, reflecting influence emanating from the Ghana Empire.

Serer people moved into the region in the 11th or 12th century, fleeing Islamization in the Senegal river valley. Wolof groups gradually arrived later. The Wagadu dynasty integrated them into the Baol government. Some early Serer kings included: Kolki Faye; Mbissine Ndoumbé Ngom; Massamba Fambi Ngom; Fambi Langar Ngom; Patar Xole Joof (great-grandson of Maad Ndaah Njemeh Joof). 

At some point early in its history, Baol was integrated into the Jolof Empire. The legend of Ndiadiane Ndiaye, the first &quot;Buurba Jolof&quot;, claims that the ruler of Baol voluntarily submitted to him, but this is likely a later invention to celebrate the unity of the empire. Many of the earliest &quot;buurba&quot;s came from maternal lineages native to Baol, perhaps benefiting from the prestigious historical memory of Ghana. Some even used Lambaye as an imperial residence.

The Portuguese began trading on the coast of Baol in the 15th century, bringing primarily horses and iron.

Amary Ngoné Sobel Fall, Damel of Cayor, and his cousin Maguinak Joof of Baol fought together at the Battle of Danki (1549), where they defeated the Emperor of Jolof and won independence. Fall became the first &quot;Damel-Teign&quot;, reigning over both kingdoms in a personal union and founding the Fall dynasty. This arrangement resurfaced periodically throughout the history of the two states, with frequent wars between them. Fall was son of Lingeer Ngoneh Sobel Njie and the maternal grandson of Lingeer Sobel Joof, making him a descendant of the ancient Baol royal house of Maad Ndaah Njemeh Joof.

Around the turn of the 16th century, Baol, still largely Serer and animist and under the reign of Teigne Mafane Thiaw, was invaded by the nominally Islamic Cayor. Defeated in battle, some of the priests of Baol took refuge with the Maad Saloum, founding the city of Kaolack. 
In 1697 Teigne Lat Sukaabe Fall conquered Cayor and built a powerful, centralized state backed by a military armed with firearms. Upon his death, however, he deeded each kingdom to a separate son, and the rivalry between them continued. During the 18th century, Damel Maïsa Teindde Ouédji of Cayor annexed Baol, but the kingdom was embroiled in a succession dispute after his death. Baol regained its independence in 1756.

The French conquest of Baol began in 1859 under Governor Louis Faidherbe. Most of Baol was conquered by 1874, but complete control of the former kingdom was only established in 1895 when it was divided into two provinces. Under colonialism, Mouridism, whose founder Amadou Bamba was a Baol-Baol, spread widely in the region.

==Government==
The social and political systems were basically the same as those of its larger neighbor, Cayor. The government was composed of the great electors who selected the Teigne, a crown-slave bureaucracy directly under the king, and representatives of each of the dependent communities (pastoralists, fishermen, clergy, castes and women).

Baol was ruled by a mixed dynasty: the Wagadu maternal lineage (from the Ghana Empire) along with the Serer paternal dynasties of N&#x27;Gom (or Ngum), Thiaw, Joof or Diouf, and Faye. The heir to the throne was given the title of &quot;Thialao&quot;, and ruled over the province of Salao.

==Economy and Society==
Baol was famous for its horses. It had unique breeds, which were faster and more robust than most of the horses on the plain. The kingdom&#x27;s primary seaports were at Saly Portudal and Mbour, giving the nobles access to imported luxuries and firearms that they purchased with slaves raided from outlying villages or in war.

Baol was a Wolof kingdom, but included large communities of Serer-Safen and other Serer groups. Natives of Baol are known as &#x27;Baol-Baol&#x27;, a common formulation in Senegal (e.g. Saloum-Saloum, Waalo-Waalo, etc.)

<text>North Norfolk is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2024 by Steffan Aquarone, a Liberal Democrat.

==Constituency profile==
The seat covers a long stretch of the Norfolk coast including the seaside towns of Cromer, Wells-next-the-Sea and Sheringham.

== History ==
The North Division of Norfolk was first created by the Reform Act 1867 as one of three two-member divisions of the Parliamentary County of Norfolk. Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the three two-member county divisions were replaced with six single-member divisions. The second version of this constituency was one of the single-member seats. It has remained as a single-member seat since then, being designated as a County Constituency from the 1950 general election.

Formerly held by Labour from 1945 to 1970, then the Conservatives from 1970 to 2001, the seat was represented by the Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb from 2001 until he stood down for the 2019 general election, when the Conservatives regained the seat from the Lib Dems with a swing of 17.5%. However the Lib Dems re-took the seat at the following general election in 2024 with a swing of 16.8%.

The 2001 general election marked the first time that a Liberal aligned candidate had won a seat in Norfolk since 1929. This was to be followed by the election of Simon Wright in Norwich South in 2010. While Wright&#x27;s success was short-lived (he was defeated in 2015), Lamb retained his seat, which at the 2015 election was one of only two Liberal Democrat seats in southern England, and one of only eight in the whole UK. At the 2017 general election, in which the Liberal Democrats lost five of their nine seats, North Norfolk was one of the four held. Although the seat had been held by Labour for the 25 years following World War II, Labour have slumped to a distant third in recent years, and came fourth in 2015, and last in a narrower field of three candidates in 2017.

North Norfolk was described by the Earl of Leicester as &quot;the one constituency in England where, in 1964, it was so feudal that it had to be explained to the electors that the ballot was secret.&quot; Feudal is used as a metaphor, or shorthand, meaning constitutionally backward.

== Boundaries and boundary changes ==
=== 1868–1885 ===
* The Hundreds of East Flegg, West Flegg, Happing, Tunstead, Erpingham (North), Erpingham (South), Eynsford, Holt and North Greenhoe.

=== 1983–2010 ===
* The District of North Norfolk.

&quot;The seat was extended westwards, regaining Wells-next-the-Sea and areas comprising the former Rural District of Walsingham, including Fakenham, from North West Norfolk. Suburbs of Norwich, including Hellesdon and Sprowston, were transferred to Norwich North, and remaining southern areas, including Aylsham, to the new constituency of Mid Norfolk.&quot;

=== 2010–2024 ===

<text>Hadad (), Haddad, Adad (Akkadian: &quot;DIM&quot;, pronounced as &quot;Adād&quot;), or Iškur (Sumerian) was the storm- and rain-god in the Canaanite and ancient Mesopotamian religions.
He was attested in Ebla as &quot;Hadda&quot; in c. 2500 BCE. From the Levant, Hadad was introduced to Mesopotamia by the Amorites, where he became known as the Akkadian (Assyrian-Babylonian) god Adad. Adad and Iškur are usually written with the logogram - the same symbol used for the Hurrian god Teshub. Hadad was also called Rimon/Rimmon, Pidar, Rapiu, [[Hadad|Baal-Zephon]], or often simply [[Baʿal]] (Lord); however, the latter title was also used for other gods. The bull was the symbolic animal of Hadad. He appeared bearded, often holding a club and thunderbolt and wearing a bull-horned headdress. Hadad was equated with the Greek god Zeus, the Roman god Jupiter (Jupiter Dolichenus), as well as the Babylonian Bel.

The Baal Cycle or Epic of Baal is a collection of stories about the Canaanite Baal, also referred to as Hadad. It was composed between 1400 and 1200 B.C. and rediscovered in the excavation of Ugarit, an ancient city in modern-day Syria.

The storm-god Adad and the sun-god Shamash jointly became the patron gods of oracles and divination in Mesopotamia.

==Adad in Akkad and Sumer==
In Akkadian, Adad is also known as Rammanu (&quot;Thunderer&quot;) cognate with &quot;Raˁmā&quot; and &quot;Raˁam&quot;, a byname of Hadad. Many scholars formerly took Rammanu to be an independent Akkadian god, but he was later identified with Hadad.

Though originating in northern Mesopotamia, Adad was identified by the same Sumerogram that designated Iškur in the south. His worship became widespread in Mesopotamia after the First Babylonian dynasty. A text dating from the reign of Ur-Ninurta characterizes the two sides of Adad/Iškur as threatening in his stormy rage, and benevolent in giving life.

Iškur appears in the list of gods found at Shuruppak but was of far less importance, perhaps because storms and rain were scarce in Sumer and agriculture there depended on irrigation instead. The gods Enlil and Ninurta also had storm god features that diminished Iškur&#x27;s distinct role, and he sometimes appears as the assistant or companion of these more prominent gods.

When Enki distributed the destinies, he made Iškur inspector of the cosmos. In one litany, Iškur is proclaimed again and again as &quot;great radiant bull, your name is heaven&quot; and also called son of Anu, lord of Karkara; twin-brother of Enki, lord of abundance, lord who rides the storm, lion of heaven.

In other texts Adad/Iškur is sometimes son of the moon god Nanna/Sin by Ningal and brother of Utu/Shamash and Inanna/Ishtar. He is also sometimes described as the son of Enlil.

The bull was portrayed as Adad/Iškur&#x27;s sacred animal starting in the Old Babylonian period (early 2nd millennium BCE).

Adad/Iškur&#x27;s consort (both in early Sumerian and the much later Assyrian texts) was the grain goddess Shala, who is also sometimes associated with the god Dagānu. She was also called &quot;Gubarra&quot; in the earliest texts. The fire god Gibil (Girra in Akkadian) is sometimes the son of Iškur and Shala.

He is identified with the Anatolian storm-god Teshub, whom the Mitannians designated with the same Sumerogram . Occasionally he is identified with the Amorite god Amurru.

The Babylonian center of Adad/Iškur&#x27;s cult was Karkara in the south, his chief temple being ; his spouse Shala was worshipped in a temple named . In Assyria, Adad was developed along with his warrior aspect. During the Middle Assyrian Empire, from the reign of Tiglath-Pileser I (1115-1077 BCE), Adad had a double sanctuary with Anu in Assur, and the two are often associated in invocations. The name Adad and various alternate forms (&quot;Dadu&quot;, &quot;Bir&quot;, &quot;Dadda&quot;) are often found in Assyrian king names.

Adad/Iškur presents two aspects in hymns, incantations, and votive inscriptions. On the one hand, he brings rain in due season to fertilize the land; on the other, he sends storms to wreak havoc and destruction. He is pictured on monuments and cylinder seals (sometimes with a horned helmet) with the lightning and the thunderbolt (sometimes in the form of a spear), and in hymns his sombre aspects predominate. His association with the sun-god Shamash, with the two deities alternating in the control of nature, tends to imbue him with some traits of a solar deity.

According to Alberto Green, descriptions of Adad starting in the Kassite period and in the region of Mari emphasize his destructive, stormy character and his role as a fearsome warrior deity, in contrast to Iškur&#x27;s more peaceful and pastoral character.

Shamash and Adad jointly became the gods of oracles and divination, invoked in all the ceremonies to determine the divine will: through inspecting a sacrificial animal&#x27;s liver, the action of oil bubbles in a basin of water, or the movements of the heavenly bodies. They are similarly addressed in royal annals and votive inscriptions as &quot;bele biri&quot; (lords of divination).

==Hadad in Ugarit==
In religious texts, Ba‘al/Hadad is the lord of the sky who governs rain and crops, master of fertility and protector of life and growth. His absence brings drought, starvation, and chaos. Texts of the Baal Cycle from Ugarit are fragmentary and assume much background knowledge. 

The supreme god El resides on Mount Lel (Night?) where the assembly of the gods meets. At the beginning of the cycle, there appears to a feud between El and Ba‘al. El appoints one of his sons, called both prince Yamm (Sea) and judge Nahar (River), as king over the gods and changes Yamm&#x27;s name from &quot;yw&quot; to &quot;mdd ’il&quot; (darling of El). El tells his son that he will have to drive off Ba‘al to secure the throne. 
In this battle Ba‘al is somehow weakened, but the divine craftsman Kothar-wa-Khasis crafts two magic clubs for Ba’al as weapons that help Ba’al strike down Yamm and Ba&#x27;al is supreme. ‘Athtart proclaims Ba‘al&#x27;s victory and salutes Ba‘al/Hadad as (Rider on the Clouds), a phrase applied by editors of modern English Bibles to Yahweh in Psalm 68.4. At ‘Athtart&#x27;s urging Ba‘al &quot;scatters&quot; Yamm and proclaims that he is dead and warmth is assured.

A later passage refers to Ba‘al&#x27;s victory over Lotan, the many-headed sea dragon. Due to gaps in the text it is not known whether Lotan is another name for Yamm or a character in a similar story. These stories may have been allegories of crops threatened by the winds, storms, and floods from the Mediterranean sea.

A palace is built for Ba‘al with silver, gold, and cedar wood from Mount Lebanon and Sirion. In his new palace Ba‘al hosts a great feast for the other gods. When urged by Kothar-wa-Khasis, Ba’al reluctantly opens a window in his palace and sends forth thunder and lightning. He then invites Mot (Death, the god of drought and the underworld), another son of El, to join the feast.

But Mot, the eater of human flesh and blood, is insulted when offered only bread and wine. He threatens to break Ba‘al to pieces and swallow him, and even Ba‘al cannot stand against Death. Gaps here make interpretation dubious. It seems that by the advice of the sun goddess Shapash, Ba‘al mates with a heifer and dresses the resultant calf in his own clothes as a gift to Mot, and then himself prepares to go down to the underworld in the guise of a helpless shade. News of Ba‘al&#x27;s apparent death leads even El to mourn. Ba‘al&#x27;s sister ‘Anat finds Ba‘al&#x27;s corpse, presumably really the dead calf, and she buries the body with a funeral feast. The god ‘Athtar is appointed to take Ba‘al&#x27;s place, but he is a poor substitute. Meanwhile, ‘Anat finds Mot, cleaves him with a sword, burns him with fire, and throws his remains to the birds. But the earth is still cracked with drought until Shapsh fetches Ba‘al back.

Seven years later Mot returns and attacks Ba‘al, but the battle is quelled when Shapsh tells Mot that El now supports Ba’al. Mot surrenders to Ba‘al and recognizes him as king.

==Hadad in Egypt==

In the Amherst Papyrus, Baal Zephon (Hadad) is identified with the Egyptian god Horus: &quot;May Baal from Zephon bless you&quot;, Amherst Papyrus 63, 7:3 and in 11:13-14: &quot;and from Zephon may Horus help us&quot;. Classical sources translate this name as Zeus Kasios, since in Pelusium, the statue of Zeus Kasios was considered the image of Harpocrates (Horus the Child). Zeus Casius had inherited some traits from Apollo as well. They also recall his conflict with Typhon over that mountain (&quot;Mount Casius&quot; on the Syrian-Turkish border or &quot;Casion&quot; near Pelusium in Egypt). The reason why Baal could be both identified with Horus and his rival Set; is because in Egypt the element of the storm was considered foreign as Set was a god of strangers and outsiders, thus because the Egyptians had no better alternative to identify their native god Set with another neighboring deity, they tentatively associated him with Hadad since he was a storm-god, but when the god Baal (Hadad) is not specifically attributed the traits of rain and thunder and is instead perceived as a god of the sky generically, which is what is embodied by his form &quot;Baal Zaphon&quot; as the chief deity who resides on the mountain (for example a 14th-century letter from the king of Ugarit to the Egyptian pharaoh places Baʿal Zaphon as equivalent to Amun also), in that case he&#x27;s more similar to the Egyptian Horus in that capacity (comparable to Baalshamin as well). The different interpretation could also be based on the fact that Set had been associated with Hadad by the Hyksos. Most likely originally Set referred to another deity also addressed by the title &quot;Baal&quot; (one of the many; an example of this would be the Baal of Tyre) who happened to display storm-like traits especially in Egypt since they were foreign and as such duly emphasized; when instead his weather features probably weren&#x27;t all that prominent in other cultures who worshipped equivalents of him, but given that the only storm-god available for identification in Semitic culture was Hadad and in Hittite &quot;Sutekh&quot; (a war-god who&#x27;s been hypothesized to be an alternative name of Teshub, but it remains unclear), the traits matched the characteristics of the Egyptian deity, and an association between the two was considered plausible, also given by the fact that both the Hittites and Semitic Hyksos were foreigners in the Egyptian land who brought their gods with them, and their main god happened to display storm-like traits and was also associated with these foreigners who came to Egypt, a characteristic that would make him similar to the perception that the Egyptians had of Set. This would once again echo the mythological motif of a previous chief of the Pantheon who gets replaced by the new generation of deities represented by the younger ascendant ruler and newly appointed chief of the gods, as is the case also for the Hittite &quot;Cycle of Kumarbi&quot; where Teshub displaces the previously established father of the gods Kumarbi. In Amherst XII/15 the same identification as before is once again stated: &quot;Baal from Zephon, Horus&quot; (BT mn Şpn Hr).

==Hadad in Aram and ancient Israel==
In the second millennium BCE, the king of Yamhad or Halab (modern Aleppo), who claimed to be &quot;beloved of Hadad&quot;, received the tribute of statue of Ishtar from the king of Mari, to be displayed in the temple of Hadad in Halab Citadel. Hadad is called &quot;the god of Aleppo&quot; on a stele of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser I.

The element &quot;Hadad&quot; appears in a number of theophoric names borne by kings of the region. Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated the Midianites in Moab, was the fourth king of Edom. Hadadezer (&quot;Hadad-is-help&quot;) was the Aramean king defeated by David. Later Aramean kings of Damascus seem to have habitually assumed the title of Ben-Hadad (son of Hadad). One was Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram whom the Judean king Asa sent to invade the northern Kingdom of Israel. A votive basalt stele from the 9th or 8th century, BCE found in Bredsh north of Aleppo, is dedicated to Melqart and bears the name Ben-Hadad, king of Aram. The seventh of the twelve sons of Ishmael is also named Hadad.

A set of related bynames include Aramaic , Old South Arabic , Hebrew , and Akkadian (&quot;Thunderer&quot;), presumably originally vocalized as &quot;Ramān&quot; in Aramaic and Hebrew. The Hebrew spelling with Masoretic vocalization &quot;Rimmôn&quot; is identical with the Hebrew word meaning &#x27;pomegranate&#x27; and may be an intentional misspelling and/or parody of the deity&#x27;s original name.

The word &quot;Hadad-rimmon&quot; (or &quot;Hadar-rimmon&quot;) in the phrase &quot;the mourning of (or at) Hadad-rimmon&quot;, has aroused much discussion. According to Jerome and the older Christian interpreters, the mourning is for something that occurred at a place called Hadad-rimmon (&quot;Maximianopolis&quot;) in the valley of Megiddo. This event was generally held to be the death of Josiah (or, as in the Targum, the death of Ahab at the hands of Hadadrimmon). But even before the discovery of the Ugaritic texts, some suspected that Hadad-rimmon might be a dying-and-rising god like Adonis or Tammuz, perhaps even the same as Tammuz, and the allusion could then be to mournings for Hadad such as those of Adonis festivals. T. K. Cheyne pointed out that the Septuagint reads simply Rimmon, and argues that this may be a corruption of Migdon (Megiddo) and ultimately of Tammuz-Adon. He would render the verse, &quot;In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of the women who weep for Tammuz-Adon&quot; (&quot;Adon&quot; means &quot;lord&quot;). No further evidence has come to light to resolve such speculations.

In the Books of Kings, Jezebel – the wife of the Northern Israelite King Ahab promoted the cult of Ba&#x27;al in her adopted nation. John Day argues that Jezebel&#x27;s Baʿal was possibly Baʿal Shamem (Lord of the Heavens), a title most often applied to Hadad.

==Sanchuniathon==
In Sanchuniathon&#x27;s account Hadad is once called Adodos, but is mostly named Demarûs. This is a puzzling form, probably from Ugaritic , which appears in parallelism with Hadad, or possibly a Greek corruption of &quot;Hadad Ramān&quot;. Sanchuniathon&#x27;s Hadad is son of Sky by a concubine who is then given to the god Dagon while she is pregnant by Sky. This appears to be an attempt to combine two accounts of Hadad&#x27;s parentage, one of which is the Ugaritic tradition that Hadad was son of Dagon. The cognate Akkadian god Adad is also often called the son of Anu (&quot;Sky&quot;). The corresponding Hittite god Teshub is likewise son of Anu (after a fashion).

In Sanchuniathon&#x27;s account, it is Sky who first fights against Pontus (&quot;Sea&quot;). Then Sky allies himself with Hadad. Hadad takes over the conflict but is defeated, at which point unfortunately no more is said of this matter. Sanchuniathion agrees with Ugaritic tradition in making Muth, the Ugaritic Mot, whom he also calls &quot;Death&quot;, the son of El.

<text>Military doctrine is the expression of how military forces contribute to campaigns, major operations, battles, and engagements. A military doctrine outlines what military means should be used, how forces should be structured, where forces should be deployed, and the modes of cooperation between types of forces. &quot;Joint doctrine&quot; refers to the doctrines shared and aligned by multinational forces or joint service operations.

There are three broad categories of military doctrines: (1) Offensive doctrines aim to &quot;punish&quot; an adversary, (2) Defensive doctrines aim to &quot;deny&quot; an adversary, and (3) Deterrent doctrines aim to &quot;disarm&quot; an adversary. Different military doctrines have different implications for world politics. For example, offensive doctrines tend to lead to arms races and conflicts.

==Defining doctrine==

NATO&#x27;s definition of doctrine, used unaltered by many member nations, is:
In 1998 the Canadian Army stated:
A U.S. Air Force Air University staff study in 1948 defined military doctrine functionally as &quot;those concepts, principles, policies, tactics, techniques, practices, and procedures which are essential to efficiency in organizing, training, equipping, and employing its tactical and service units&quot;.

A U.S. Army essay written in 2016 similarly defined military doctrine as &quot;consist[ing] of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)&quot;.

In 2005 Gary Sheffield of the Defence Studies Department of King&#x27;s College London/JSCSC quoted J F C Fuller&#x27;s 1923 definition of doctrine as the &quot;central idea of an army&quot;.

In 1965 the Soviet &quot;Dictionary of Basic Military Terms&quot; defined military doctrine as &quot;a state&#x27;s officially accepted system of scientifically founded views on the nature of modern wars and the use of the armed forces in them. ... Military doctrine has two aspects: social-political and military-technical.&quot; The social-political side &quot;encompasses all questions concerning methodology, economic, and social bases, the political goals of war. It is the defining and the more stable side.&quot; The other side, the military-technical, must accord with the political goals. It includes the &quot;creation of military structure, technical equipping of the armed forces, their training, definition of forms and means of conducting operations and war as a whole&quot;.

==Development of doctrine==

Before the development of separate doctrinal publications, many nations expressed their military philosophy through regulations.

===United Kingdom===
Field Service Regulations were issued by the War Office in 1909, 1917, 1923, 1930, and 1935. Similar publications under various names were subsequently published. Formal British Military Doctrine was first published in 1988 and in 1996 became British Defence Doctrine applicable throughout the armed forces.

===France===
The development of military doctrine in France came about in the aftermath of the nation&#x27;s defeat during the Franco-Prussian war. The École supérieure de guerre, under the direction of its commandant, Ferdinand Foch, began developing a consistent doctrine for handling armies, corps, and divisions. Foch&#x27;s 1906 work, &quot;Des principes de la guerre&quot; (translated by Hilaire Belloc as &quot;The Principles of War&quot;) expressed this doctrine.

===Prussia and German Empire===
Prussian doctrine was published as &quot;Regulations for the Instruction of the Troops in Field Service and the Exercises of the larger Units of the 17th June, 1870&quot;. The doctrine was revised in 1887 and published in English in 1893 as &quot;The Order of Field Service of the German Army&quot;, by Karl Kaltenborn und Stachau, and once again in 1908 as &quot;Felddienst Ordnung&quot; (&quot;Field Service Regulations&quot;).

===Soviet Union===
Soviet doctrine was greatly influenced by M. V. Frunze.

===United States===
In the period between the Napoleonic Wars and the First World War, doctrine was defined by the War Department in &quot;Field Service Regulations&quot;. In addition, many officers wrote military manuals that were printed by private publishers, such as Hardee&#x27;s Tactics, used by both Confederate and Union forces. General George B. McClellan wrote a cavalry manual, &quot;Regulations and Instructions for the Field Service of the U.S. Cavalry,&quot; in 1862.

The General Staff became responsible for writing Field Service Regulations. They were published in 1908, were revised in 1913 and again in 1914 based on experiences of European powers in the first months of the war.

As late as 1941 U.S. Army doctrine was published in &quot;Field Service Regulations – Operations&quot;. This designation was dropped and replaced by U.S. Army Field Manuals (FM).

==Relationship between doctrine and strategy==

Military doctrine is a key component of grand strategy. 

NATO&#x27;s definition of strategy is &quot;presenting the manner in which military power should be developed and applied to achieve national objectives or those of a group of nations.&quot; The official definition of strategy by the United States Department of Defense is: &quot;Strategy is a prudent idea or set of ideas for employing the instruments of national power in a synchronized and integrated fashion to achieve national or multinational objectives.&quot;

Military strategy provides the rationale for military operations. Field Marshal Viscount Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff and co-chairman of the Anglo-US Combined Chiefs of Staff Committee for most of the Second World War, described the art of military strategy as:
&quot;to derive from the [policy] aim a series of military objectives to be achieved: to assess these objectives as to the military requirements they create, and the pre-conditions which the achievement of each is likely to necessitate: to measure available and potential resources against the requirements and to chart from this process a coherent pattern of priorities and a rational course of action.&quot;

Instead, doctrine seeks to provide a common conceptual framework for a military service:
* what the service perceives itself to be (&quot;Who are we?&quot;)
* what its mission is (&quot;What do we do?&quot;)
* how the mission is to be carried out (&quot;How do we do that?&quot;)
* how the mission has been carried out in history (&quot;How did we do that in the past?&quot;)
* other questions.

In the same way, doctrine is neither operations nor tactics. It serves as a conceptual framework uniting all three levels of warfare.

Doctrine reflects the judgments of professional military officers, and to a lesser but important extent civilian leaders, about what is and is not militarily possible and necessary.

Factors to consider include:
* military technology
* national geography
* the capabilities of adversaries
* the capability of one&#x27;s own organization
==Military doctrine by country==

===China===

Chinese military doctrine is influenced by a number of sources including an indigenous classical military tradition characterized by strategists such as Sun Tzu and modern strategists such as Mao Zedong, along with Western and Soviet influences. One distinctive characteristic of Chinese military science is that it places emphasis on the relationship between the military and society and views military force as merely one part of an overarching grand strategy.

According to French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;, the Chinese nuclear doctrine is to maintain a nuclear force allowing it to deter and respond to a nuclear attack. However, new evolutions show that China could allow use of its nuclear arsenal in more situations.

===France===
Following the defeat of the French Army in the Franco-Prussian War, the French military, as part of its movements to increase professionalism, emphasized officer training at the École de Guerre. Ferdinand Foch, as an instructor, argued against the concept of a commander moving units without informing subordinates of his intentions. In doing so, a common doctrine served as a point of training.

We have then, a doctrine. All the brains have been limbered up and regard all questions from an identical point of view. The fundamental idea of the problem being known, each one will solve the problem in his own fashion, and these thousand fashions, we may very well be sure, will act to direct all their efforts to a common objective.Prior to WWI, France had an offensive military doctrine.

In the aftermath of WWI, France adopted a defensive military doctrine where the Maginot Line played a central role in its deterrence of Germany.

===Germany===

Prior to WWI, Germany had an offensive military doctrine exemplified by the Schlieffen Plan. Germany also devoted considerable resources to building a fleet of battleships, which provoked fears among European powers. During World War II, Germany deployed an operational strategy sometimes referred to as Blitzkrieg in its offensives against Poland and France.

German military doctrine incorporates the concept of &quot;Auftragstaktik&quot; (Mission-type tactics), which can be seen as a doctrine within which formal rules can be selectively suspended in order to overcome &quot;friction&quot;. Carl von Clausewitz stated that &quot;Everything in war is very simple but the simplest thing is difficult&quot;. Problems will occur with misplaced communications, troops going to the wrong location, delays caused by weather, etc., and it is the duty of the commander to do his best to overcome them. Auftragstaktik encourages commanders to exhibit initiative, flexibility and improvisation while in command.

===India===
The current combat doctrine of the Indian Army is based on the effective combined utilization of holding formations and strike formations. In the case of an attack, the holding formations would contain the enemy and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralize enemy forces. In the case of an Indian attack, the holding formations would pin enemy forces down whilst the strike formations attack at a point of Indian choosing.

India&#x27;s nuclear doctrine follows the policy of credible minimum deterrence, No first strike, No use of nuclear weapons on Non-nuclear states and Massive nuclear retaliation in case deterrence fails.

India has recently adopted a new war doctrine known as &quot;Cold Start&quot; and its military has conducted exercises several times since then based on this doctrine. &quot;Cold Start&quot; involves joint operations between India&#x27;s three services and integrated battle groups for offensive operations. A key component is the preparation of India&#x27;s forces to be able to quickly mobilize and take offensive actions without crossing the enemy&#x27;s nuclear-use threshold. A leaked US diplomatic cable disclosed that it was intended to be taken off the shelf and implemented within a 72-hour period during a crisis.

===Israel===
====Strategic doctrine====
Israel&#x27;s military doctrine is formed by its small size and lack of strategic depth. To compensate, it relies on deterrence, including through a presumed nuclear weapons arsenal. It tries to overcome its quantitative disadvantage by staying qualitatively superior. Its doctrine is based on a strategy of defense but is operationally offensive, by pre-empting enemy threats and securing a quick, decisive victory if deterrence fails. Israel maintains a heightened state of readiness, advanced early warning systems, and a robust military intelligence capability to ensure attackers cannot take advantage of Israel&#x27;s lack of strategic depth. Early warning and speedy victory is also desired because the Israel Defense Forces rely heavily on reservists during major wars; lengthy mobilization of reservists is costly to the Israeli economy. Israeli doctrine is constructed with the assumption that Israel would be largely self-sufficient in its war-fighting, without nearby allies to assist.

Israel&#x27;s emphasis on operational offense was espoused by its first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, as early as 1948 (during the 1948 Arab–Israeli war):
If [the Arabs] attack us as they did this time, we shall transfer the war to the gates of their country. ... We do not intend to conduct ... a static defensive war at the venue where we were attacked. If they attack us again, in the future, we want the war to be waged not in our country, but in the enemy&#x27;s country, and we want to be not on the defensive but on the attack.

Yitzhak Rabin, who was Chief of the IDF Staff during the Six-Day War, offered a similar explanation for Israel&#x27;s pre-emptive beginning to the war:
The basic philosophy of Israel was not to initiate war, unless an act of war was carried out against us. We then lived within the lines prior to the Six-Day War, lines that gave no depth to Israel—and therefore, Israel was in a need, whenever there would be a war, to go immediately on the offensive—to carry the war to the enemy&#x27;s land.

====Tactical doctrine====
IDF command has been decentralized since the early days of the state, with junior commanders receiving broad authority within the context of mission-type orders. Israeli junior officer training has emphasized the need to make quick decisions in battle to prepare them appropriately for maneuver warfare.

===Russia and the Soviet Union===

The Soviet meaning of military doctrine was very different from U.S. military usage of the term. Soviet Minister of Defence Marshal Andrei Grechko defined it in 1975 as &quot;a system of views on the nature of war and methods of waging it, and on the preparation of the country and army for war, officially adopted in a given state and its armed forces&quot;.

In Soviet times, theorists emphasised both the political and &quot;military-technical&quot; sides of military doctrine, while from the Soviet point of view, Westerners ignored the political side. However, the political side of Soviet military doctrine, Western commentators Harriet F Scott and William Scott said, &quot;best explained Soviet moves in the international arena&quot;.

Soviet (and contemporary Russian) doctrine emphasizes combined-arms warfare as well as operational warfare. It emphasizes the initiation of military hostilities at a time, date, and location of its choosing on terms of its choosing and the extensive preparation of the battlespace for operations.

Former Soviet/Russian doctrine sacrifices tactical flexibility and adaptability for strategic and operational flexibility and adaptability; tactical personnel are trained as relatively inflexible executors of specific, detailed orders, while the operational-strategic level of Russian military doctrine is where most innovation takes place.

The Soviet response to problems of nuclear strategy began with classified publications. However, by 1962, with the publication in the Marshal of the Soviet Union Vasily Sokolovsky&#x27;s volume, &quot;Military Strategy&quot;, the Soviets laid out their officially endorsed thoughts on the matter, and their ideas on how to cope with nuclear conflict.

===Sweden===
In the 2000s and early 2010s, the Moderate Party–led governments transformed the Swedish Armed Forces from a Cold War posture of defence to one of participation in international operations. The assumption was that Sweden&#x27;s homeland would face minimal external threats. Supreme Commander Sverker Göranson estimates that as of 2014, Swedish forces could resist a limited enemy attack for only one week.

The annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the subsequent Russian invasion of Ukraine has stirred debate within Sweden that a return to significant defensive forces and a closer alliance with NATO is necessary in the wake of Russia&#x27;s actions in Ukraine. As of the 7th of March 2024, Sweden has joined NATO.

===United Kingdom===
For some 280 years the British Army did not have a formal &#x27;Military Doctrine&#x27;, although a huge number of publications dealing with tactics, operations and administration had been produced. However, during his tenure as Chief of the General Staff (1985–89) General Sir Nigel Bagnall directed that British Military Doctrine was to be prepared, and tasked Colonel (later General) Timothy Granville-Chapman (an artillery officer who had been his Military Assistant in Headquarters 1st British Corps) to prepare it. The first edition of British Military Doctrine (BMD) was published in 1988. It led to the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force developing their own maritime and air-power doctrines. However, in 1996 the first edition of British Defence Doctrine (BDD) was published, drawing heavily on the BMD. The Army adopted BDD as their Military Doctrine. The fourth edition of BDD was published in 2011; it uses the NATO definition of doctrine.

NATO underpins the defence of the UK and its Allies, while also providing deployable expeditionary capabilities to support and defend UK interests further afield. However, until recently, most NATO doctrine has been mirrored by equivalent, but different, national Joint Doctrines. This has often caused a dilemma for UK Armed Forces committed to operations as part of a NATO-based coalition.

In 2012, the Chief of Defence Staff and Permanent Undersecretary for Defence issued direction on how the UK contribution to NATO could be improved, stating that &#x27;We should use NATO doctrine wherever we can, and ensure coherence of UK doctrine with NATO wherever we cannot.&#x27;

The 2014 edition of Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP) 0-01 UK Defence Doctrine reflects this change in policy.

However, the British Army had formal publications for a long time, and these amounted to its doctrine. &quot;Field Service Regulations&quot; (FSR), on the Prussian pattern, were published in 1906 and with amendments and replacement editions lasted into the Second World War. They required each arm and service to produce their own specific publications to give effect to FSR. After the Second World War FSR were replaced by various series of manuals, again with specific training pamphlets for each arm and service. These deal with operational and tactical matters.

The current capstone publication for the army is Army Doctrine Publication &quot;Operations&quot; alongside maritime and air-power equivalents and joint warfare publications all under the umbrella of BDD. The four layers constituting &quot;land doctrine&quot; are summarised as:
* British Defence Doctrine – provides philosophy
* Joint (and Allied) Operational Doctrine and Capstone Environmental Doctrine (JDP 01 Joint Operations AJP-01 Allied Joint Operations ADP Operations – provides principles
* Joint Functional and Thematic Doctrine such as JDP 5-00 Campaign Planning and JDP 3-40 Security and Stabalisation provide doctrine on specific areas or themes. JDP 5-00( ) JDP 3-40( )
* Army Field Manual (two volumes) – provides practices
* Land component handbooks and special to arm publications – provide procedures

The &quot;Army Field Manual&quot; comprises Volumes 1 (Combined Arms Operations) in 12 parts led by &quot;Formation Tactics&quot; and &quot;Battlegroup Tactics&quot;, and Volume 2 (Operations in Specific Environments) in 6 parts (desert, urban, etc.).

BDD is divided into two parts: &quot;Defence Context&quot; and &quot;Military Doctrine&quot;. Defence Context deals with two matters. First, the relationship between Defence policy and military strategy, and—while highlighting the utility of force – emphasizes the importance of addressing security issues through a comprehensive, rather than an exclusively military, approach. Second it expounds the Nature of and the Principles of War, the three Levels of Warfare (Strategic, Operational and Tactical) and its evolving character. The ten Principles of War are a refined and extended version of those that appeared in FSR between the two world wars and based on the work of JFC Fuller.

The Military Doctrine states that it comprises national Joint Doctrine, Higher Level Environmental Doctrine, Tactical Doctrine, Allied Doctrine and doctrine adopted or adapted from ad hoc coalition partners. The part deals with three matters. First it describes the likely employment of the British Armed Forces in pursuit of Defence policy aims and objectives. Next it explains the three components of fighting power (conceptual, physical and moral components) and the criticality of the operating context to its effective application. Finally it describes the British approach to the conduct of military operations—&quot;the British way of war&quot;. This includes mission command, the manoeuvrist approach and a warfighting ethos that requires accepting risks.

The BDD is linked to a variety of unclassified policy documents such as Defence White Papers and Strategic Defence Reviews, as well as classified Strategic Planning Guidance. The current, 2011, edition of BDD is underpinned by recent developmental and conceptual publications such as &quot;The DCDC Global Strategic Trends Programme 2007–2036&quot; and &quot;The High Level Operational Conceptual Framework&quot;, which comprises specific army, navy and air force publications.

===United States===

====Sources====
The United States Constitution invests Congress with the powers to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States and to raise and support armies. Title 10 of the United States Code states what Congress expects the Army, in conjunction with the other Services, to accomplish. This includes: Preserve the peace and security and provide for the defense of the United States, its territories and possessions, and any areas it occupies; Support national policies; Implement national objectives; Overcome any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the United States.

====Key concepts====
Most modern US doctrine is based around the concept of power projection and full spectrum operations, which combine offensive, defensive, and stability or civil support operations simultaneously as part of an interdependent joint or combined force to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. They employ synchronized action—lethal and nonlethal—proportional to the mission and informed by a thorough understanding of all dimensions of the operational environment.

Offensive operations defeat and destroy enemy forces, and seize terrain, resources, and population centers. They impose the commander&#x27;s will on the enemy. Defensive operations defeat an enemy attack, gain time, economize forces, and develop conditions favorable for offensive or stability operations.

Stability operations encompass various military missions, tasks, and activities conducted abroad to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment, provide essential governmental services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction, and humanitarian relief. Civil support operations are support tasks and missions to homeland civil authorities for domestic emergencies, and for designated law enforcement and other activities. This includes operations dealing with the consequences of natural or manmade disasters, accidents, and incidents within the homeland.

Under President Lyndon Johnson it was stated that the US armed forces should be able to fight two—at one point, two-and-a-half—wars at the same time. This was defined to mean a war in Europe against the Soviet Union, a war in Asia against China or North Korea, and a &quot;half-war&quot; as well—in other words, a &quot;small&quot; war in the Third World. When Richard Nixon took office in 1969, he altered the formula to state that the United States should be able to fight one-and-a-half wars simultaneously.

This doctrine remained in place until 1989–90, when President George H. W. Bush ordered the &quot;Base Force&quot; study which forecast a substantial cut in the military budget, an end to the Soviet Union&#x27;s global threat, and the possible beginning of new regional threats. In 1993, President Bill Clinton ordered a &quot;Bottom-Up Review&quot;, based on which a strategy called &quot;win-hold-win&quot; was declared—enough forces to win one war while holding off the enemy in another conflict, then moving on to win it after the first war is over. The final draft was changed to read that the United States must be able to win two &quot;major regional conflicts&quot; simultaneously.

The current strategic doctrine, which Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld issued in his Quadrennial Defense Review of early 2001 (before the 9/11 attacks), is a package of U.S. military requirements known as 1-4-2-1. The first 1 refers to defending the US homeland. The 4 refers to deterring hostilities in four key regions of the world. The 2 means the US armed forces must have the strength to win swiftly in two near-simultaneous conflicts in those regions. The final 1 means that the US forces must win one of those conflicts &quot;decisively&quot;.

The general policy objectives are to (1) assure allies and friends; (2) dissuade future military competition, (3) deter threats and coercion against U.S. interests, and (4) if deterrence fails, decisively defeat any adversary.

====United States Department of Defense====
The Department of Defense publishes Joint Publications which state all-services doctrine. The current basic doctrinal publication is Joint Publication 3-0, &quot;Doctrine for Joint Operations&quot;.

=====United States Air Force=====
Headquarters, United States Air Force, publishes current USAF doctrine. The lead agency for developing Air Force doctrine is the LeMay Center for Doctrine Development and Education; the Air Staff International Standardization Office works on multinational standardization, such as NATO Standardization Agreements (STANAGs), and agreements between the American, British, Canadian, and Australian Armies and Navies (ABCA) that affect the Air Force. Currently the basic Air Force doctrinal documents are the 10-series of Air Force publications.

=====United States Army=====
The United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) is responsible for developing Army doctrine. TRADOC was developed early in the 1970s as a response to the American Army&#x27;s difficulties in the Vietnam War, and is one of the reforms that improved Army professionalism. Currently the capstone Army doctrinal document is Army Doctrine Publication 3-0, Unified Land Operations (published October 2011).

=====United States Navy=====
The Naval Warfare Development Command (NWDC) Doctrine Department coordinates development, publication, and maintenance of United States Navy doctrine. Currently the basic unclassified naval doctrinal documents are Naval Doctrine Publications 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. NWDC is also the United States Navy lead for NATO and multinational maritime doctrine and operational standardization.

=====United States Marine Corps=====
The Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) has responsibility for United States Marine Corps doctrine. The capstone doctrinal document is &quot;Warfighting&quot; (MCDP1), along with MCDP&#x27;s 1-1, 1–2, and 1–3 (Strategy, Campaigning, and Tactics, respectively). MCDP 1-0 (Marine Corps Operations) translates the philosophical-based capstone/keystone publications into operational doctrine.

=====United States Coast Guard=====
Headquarters, United States Coast Guard, published Coast Guard Publication 1, &quot;U.S. Coast Guard: America&#x27;s Maritime Guardian&quot;, which is the source of USCG doctrine.

===SFR Yugoslavia===
With the passing of the National Defense Law of 1969, Yugoslavia adopted a total war military doctrine named &quot;Total National Defense&quot; or &quot;Total People&#x27;s Defense&quot;. It was inspired by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Liberation War against the fascist occupiers and their collaborators in the Second World War, and was designed to allow Yugoslavia to maintain or eventually reestablish its independent and non-aligned status should an invasion occur. According to it, &quot;any citizen who resists an aggressor is a member of the armed forces&quot;, thus the whole population could be turned into a monolithic resistance army.

Starting from the elementary school education, over high schools, universities, organizations and companies, the authorities prepared the entire population to contest an eventual occupation of the country and finally to liberate it. For this purpose, the Territorial Defense Forces (TO) would be formed to mobilize the population in case of an aggression. The combat readiness of the TO meant that the steps of organization and training could be bypassed after the start of hostilities. The TO would supplement the regular Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, giving it greater defensive depth and an armed local population ready to support combat actions. Large numbers of armed civilians would increase the cost of an invasion to a potential aggressor.

The most likely scenario in the doctrine being used was a general war between the NATO and the Warsaw Pact. In such a situation, Yugoslavia would remain non-aligned, and it would not accept foreign troops of either alliance on its territory. The doctrine recognized the likelihood that one side or the other might try to seize Yugoslav territory as a forward staging area, to ensure lines of communication or simply to deny the territory to enemy forces. Such action would be considered aggression and would be resisted. Regardless of ideology, the occupiers would be considered Yugoslavia&#x27;s enemy.

====Territorial Defense Forces====
The Territorial Defense Forces (TO) were formed in 1969 as an integral part of the Yugoslav &quot;Total National Defense&quot; doctrine. The TO forces consisted of able-bodied civilian males and females. Between 1 and 3 million Yugoslavs between the ages of 15 and 65 would fight under TO command as irregular or guerrilla forces in wartime. In peacetime, however, about 860,000 TO troops were involved in military training and other activities.

The TO concept focused on small, lightly armed infantry units fighting defensive actions on a familiar local terrain. A typical unit was a company-sized detachment. More than 2000 communes, factories, and other enterprises organized such units, which would fight in their home areas, maintaining local defense production essential to the overall war effort. The TO also included some larger, more heavily equipped units with wider operational responsibilities. The TO battalions and regiments operated in regional areas with artillery and antiaircraft guns and some armoured vehicles. Using their mobility and tactical initiative, these units would attempt to alleviate the pressure of enemy armored columns and air strikes on smaller TO units. In the coastal regions, TO units had naval missions. They operated some gunboats in support of navy operations. They were organized to defend strategic coastal areas and naval facilities against enemy amphibious landings and raids. They also trained some divers for use in sabotage and other special operations.

The TO was helped by the fact that most of its citizen-soldiers were one-time JNA conscripts who had completed their term of compulsory military service. However, TO recruitment was somewhat limited by the army&#x27;s desire to include as many recently released conscripts as possible in its own military reserve. Other sources of TO manpower lacked prior military service and required extensive basic training.

The TO organisation was highly decentralized and independent. TO units were organized and funded by the governments in each of the Yugoslav constituent republics: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia.

<text>Waalo () was a kingdom on the lower Senegal River in West Africa, in what is now Senegal and Mauritania. It included parts of the valley proper and areas north and south, extending to the Atlantic Ocean. To the north were Moorish emirates; to the south was the kingdom of Cayor; to the east was Jolof.

==History==
===Origins===
Oral histories claim that, before becoming a kingdom, the area of Waalo was ruled by a patchwork of Lamanes, a Serer title meaning the original owner of the land. Etymological evidence suggests that the area was ruled by the Jaa&#x27;ogo dynasty of Takrur. This aligns with early Arabic written sources which describe an island town known as Awlil (Waalo) near the mouth of the Senegal river, in a region called Senghana. 

===Founding===
The exact founding date of Waalo is debated by historians, but is associated with the rule of the first king, the semi-legendary Ndiadiane Ndiaye, in the 13th or 14th century. Ndiaye, originally a Fula from Takrur, united the Lamanes and ruled Waalo for 16 years as an arbiter or judge rather than king before, according to some oral accounts, being driven out by his half brother Barka Bo, or Barka Mbodj. After this, Ndiaye took control of Jolof and founded the Jolof Empire. Barka Mbodj was the first ruler to use the royal title &#x27;Brak&#x27;. Ndiaye eventually made Waalo a vassal.
Europeans first appeared off the coast of Waalo in the 15th century, and soon began trading. This caused a significant shift in economic power away from the Jolof heartland towards coastal vassals such as Waalo and Cayor. Buumi Jelen, a member of the royal family, may have established his own control over Waalo during this period, and is credited with creating a system of &quot;alkaldes&quot; who served as customs collectors for the Buurba Jolof. He later attempted to ally with the Portuguese to take power, but was killed by his erstwhile allies in a dispute.

The Jolof empire broke up in the aftermath of the battle of Danki in 1549, though the Brak continued to pay symbolic tribute to the Bourba Jolof until 1715.

===The French and the Desert===
In 1638, the French established the first permanent European trading settlement at the mouth of the Senegal River, moving to the site of Saint-Louis in 1659 while facing consistent military and political pressure from the Brak. The French presence would have a decisive effect on the rest of the history of Waalo.

Partly in response to the shift in trade away from Berber tribes to the French, Nasr ad-Din, a Berber Marabout, launched the Char Bouba War or the Marabout War, overthrowing the ruling aristocracy of Waalo (among other Senegal river kingdoms) in an attempt to establish an Islamic theocracy. Upon his death in 1674, however, his movement collapsed and the old hierarchies, aligned with Arab Hassan tribes north of the river and vigorously supported by the French, re-asserted themselves.

During this same period, Moroccan forces came south to the Senegal river, forcing the Brak to move the capital from Ngurbel to the south bank and permanently breaking the kingdom&#x27;s control on the north side.

===A Regional Power===
In another attempt to further strengthen their economic position in the Senegal valley, in 1724 the French allied with Maalixuri, the lord of Bethio, to pressure the &quot;Brak&quot; Yerim Mbyanik and the Emirate of Trarza into concessions. His attempt at secession from Waalo failed when the French company stopped their support. By 1734 Yerim Mbyanik had the most powerful army in the region. His rule and that of his two successors, Njaam Aram Bakar and Naatago Aram, was the apogee of Waalo-Waalo power.

Through the middle decades of the 18th century, Waalo exerted hegemony over the entire Senegal estuary and dominated Cayor as well. When the English took Saint-Louis in 1758 they found that the &quot;Brak&quot; had total control over river trade. Naatago repeatedly demanded increases in customs payments and slave prices, and blockaded the island when necessary. In 1762 he appropriated payments from Cayor intended for Saint-Louis, and two years later invaded.

===Decline===
In 1765 the &quot;Damel&quot; of Cayor counterattacked, armed with English guns, and soundly defeated the Waalo-Waalo. After Naatago&#x27;s death in 1766 a long civil war broke out, with the Moors constantly intervening and raiding. In 1775 the English took more than 8000 slaves from Waalo in less than six months.

With recurring civil war and frequent foreign meddling in succession disputes, Waalo&#x27;s power declined progressively in favor of the Moorish Emirate of Trarza.

In the 1820s the marabout of Koki Ndiaga Issa, who had amassed significant political power in Cayor, was driven out by the damel. His forces, led by general Dille Thiam, took control of Waalo instead. The French intervened however, and killed Thiam.

To stop the cripplying Moorish raids and present a unified front against the French, the Lingeer Njembot Mbodj married the Emir of Trarza in 1833. Faced with an alliance that could threaten the survival of the colony, Saint Louis attacked Waalo, deepening the long-running crisis. Njembot Mbodj was succeeded by her sister Ndate Yalle in 1847, but the French finally conquered the kingdom in 1855.

==Society==
===Government===

The royal capital of Waalo was first Ndiourbel (Guribel) on the north bank of the Senegal River (in modern Mauritania), then Ndiangué on the south bank of the river. The capital was moved to Nder on the west shore of the Lac de Guiers.

Waalo had a complicated political and social system, which has a continuing influence on Wolof culture in Senegal today, especially its highly formalized and rigid caste system. The kingdom was indirectly hereditary, ruled by three matrilineal families: the Logar, the Tedyek, and the Joos, all from different ethnic backgrounds. The Joos were of Serer origin. This Serer matriclan was established in Waalo by Lingeer Ndoye Demba of Sine. Her grandmother Lingeer Fatim Beye is the matriarch and early ancestor of this dynasty. These matrilineal families engaged in constant dynastic struggles to become &quot;Brak&quot; or king of Waalo, as well as warring with Waalo&#x27;s neighbors. The royal title &quot;Lingeer&quot; means queen or royal princess, used by the Serer and Wolof. Several Lingeer, notably Njembot Mbodj and Ndaté Yalla Mbodj ruled Waalo in their own right or as regents.

The Brak ruled with a kind of legislature, the &quot;Seb Ak Baor&quot;, that consisted of three great electors who selected the next king. Their titles come from Pulaar terms that initially meant &#x27;masters of initiation&#x27;, and originate from the period before Ndiadiane Ndiaye when Takrur dominated the area. There was also a complicated hierarchy of officials and dignitaries. Women had high positions and figured prominently in the political and military history of Waalo.

Provinces were ruled by semi-independent &quot;Kangam&quot;, such as the Bethio. Shifting allegiances between these powerful nobles, the Brak, other kingdoms, and the French of Saint-Louis led to a series of civil wars.

===Religion===
Waalo had its own traditional African religion. Islam was initially the province of the elite, but in the aftermath of Marabout War the ruling class increasingly rejected it while it become more and more widespread among the ruled. The Brak himself converted only in the 19th century.

==Economy==
Waalo played an integral role in the slave trade in the Senegal river valley, with most captives coming from regions upriver, often captured in war or slaving raids. Other trade goods included gum arabic, leather, and ivory, as well as the foodstuffs, primarily millet upon which Saint-Louis depended.

Waalo was paid fees for every boatload of gum arabic or slaves that was shipped on the river, in return for its &quot;protection&quot; of the trade.

== Kings of Waalo ==
In all, Waalo had 52 kings since its founding. Names and dates taken from John Stewart&#x27;s &quot;African States and Rulers&quot; (1989).

<doc id="100679" wikidata="Q312306" url="?curid=100679" title="Marcus Claudius Marcellus">
<text>Marcus Claudius Marcellus (; 270 – 208 BC) was a Roman general and politician during the 3rd century BC. Five times elected as consul of the Roman Republic (222, 215, 214, 210, and 208 BC). Marcellus gained the most prestigious award a Roman general could earn, the &quot;spolia opima&quot;, for killing the Gallic king Viridomarus in single combat in 222 BC at the Battle of Clastidium. Furthermore, he is noted for having conquered the fortified city of Syracuse in a protracted siege during which Archimedes, the famous mathematician, scientist, and inventor, was killed, despite Marcellus ordering the soldiers under his command not to harm him. Marcus Claudius Marcellus died in battle in 208 BC, leaving behind a legacy of military conquests and a reinvigorated Roman legend of the &quot;spolia opima&quot;.

== Early life: distinguished soldier and politician ==
Little is known of Marcus Claudius Marcellus&#x27; early years, since ancient historians and biographers were more concerned with the military exploits which came at the apex of his career. The fullest extant account is Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Marcellus&quot;, which focuses on warfare and political attainments and largely skips over events before 225 BC, beyond some general information about Marcellus&#x27; youth. Marcellus&#x27; exact birth date is unknown, yet scholars are certain he was born prior to 268 BC because he had to be over 42 when elected consul in 222 BC and he was elected to a fifth (and final) consulship for 208 BC, after he was 60. He was said by Poseidonius to have been the first in his family to take on the cognomen of Marcellus, yet there are genealogical records of his family line tracing the cognomen back to 331 BC. According to Plutarch, Marcellus was a skilled fighter in his youth and was raised with the purpose of entering military service. In his youth, Marcellus quickly distinguished himself as an ambitious warrior, known for his skill in hand-to-hand combat. He is noted for having saved the life of his brother, Otacilius, when the two were surrounded by enemy soldiers in Italy.

During his time as a Roman soldier, which included service in the First Punic War, Marcellus was praised by his superiors for his skill and valor. As a result of his fine reputation, in 226 BC he was elected to the position of curule aedile. Aediles were overseers of public buildings and festivals and enforcers of public order, and the office generally served as the first step in a Roman nobleman&#x27;s political career. Around the same time that he became an aedile, Marcellus was also awarded the position of augur, which Plutarch describes as being an interpreter of omens. By about the age of 40, Marcellus had already become an acclaimed soldier and public official. His early career came to a close in 222 BC with his election as consul, the highest political and military office in the Roman Republic.

== Middle life: the spolia opima ==
Led by the Insubrians, the Gauls of northern Italy declared war on Rome in 225 BC. Marcellus participated, initially as a soldier, in the ensuing conflict, which saw the Insubrians pushed all the way back to the Po River. They attempted to surrender, but Marcellus persuaded the two acting consuls not to accept the terms of peace. In the fourth and final year of the war, Marcellus himself was elected consul, with Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus as his colleague. As the new consuls were ushered into office, the Insubrians mustered 30,000 of their Gallic allies, the Gaesatae, to fight the Romans. Marcellus invaded Insubrian lands up to the Po River, just as the previous consuls had done. From here, the Gauls sent 10,000 men across the Po and attacked Clastidium, a Roman stronghold, to divert the Roman attacks. This battlefield was the stage for Marcellus’ confrontation with the Gallic king, Viridomarus, which cemented his place in history.

The confrontation, as told by Plutarch, is so heavy in detail that one might question the veracity of his narration. Plutarch recounts that, prior to the battle, Viridomarus spotted Marcellus, who wore commander&#x27;s insignia, and rode out to meet him. Marcellus did not recognize the king, but nonetheless wanted to fight: he had prayed to the gods to give him the finest armor possessed by the enemy, and the armor worn by Viridomarus seemed to fit this description. The two engaged in single combat, which concluded when Marcellus, “by a thrust of his spear which pierced his adversary&#x27;s breastplate, and by the impact of his horse in full career, threw him, still living, upon the ground, where, with a second and third blow, he promptly killed him.” Marcellus carried away the armor of his fallen foe, calling it the &quot;spolia opima&quot;, or &quot;richest spoils&quot;, and dedicated it to Jupiter Feretrius, as he had promised before the battle. In Roman tradition, &quot;spolia opima&quot; was considered the most prestigious and honorable prize that a general could earn. To deserve the title, the spoils must be taken from the leader of the opposing army, whom the general had killed in single combat.

Herein lies a wrinkle in Plutarch&#x27;s retelling of the event. Marcellus allegedly did not recognize his opponent, but his prayer to Jupiter Feretrius, employing the term &quot;spolia opima&quot;, implies an intention to kill a king or ruler. This inconsistency indicates that Plutarch&#x27;s story may have been exaggerated for dramatic effect, causing discrepancies. Furthermore, Plutarch had probably written the account to glorify Marcellus as a hero of Rome, instead of as a record of history. The considerably earlier account of Polybius (Polyb. 2.34) does not at all mention the &quot;spolia opima&quot; in relation to Marcellus.

Following the death of Viridomarus, the outnumbered Romans broke the siege of Clastidium, won the battle and proceeded to push the Gallic army all the way back to their primary headquarters at Mediolanum. Here, following another defeat, the Gauls surrendered to the Romans. This time the terms of peace were acceptable to the Romans, and the Gallic war ended. Polybius, a client to the Scipiones, states that much of the overall success in the Gallic War belongs to Marcellus’ colleague, Scipio, but we know from other sources that, having won the &quot;spolia opima&quot;, Marcellus was awarded a triumph. Following the Gallic wars, Marcellus seems to drop below the historical radar until the year 216 BC, ushering in the latter part of his life.

== Later life: Second Punic War ==
Marcus Claudius Marcellus re-emerged onto both the political and military scene during the Second Punic War, in which he took part in important battles. In 216 BC, the third year of the Second Punic War, Marcellus was elected as a praetor. A praetor served either as an elected magistrate or as the commander of an army, the latter of which duties Marcellus was selected to fulfil in Sicily. Unfortunately, as Marcellus and his men were preparing to ship to Sicily, his army was recalled to Rome owing to the devastating losses at Cannae, one of the worst defeats in Roman history. By the orders of the Senate, Marcellus was forced to dispatch 1,500 of his men to Rome to protect the city after the terrible defeat by Hannibal of Carthage. With his remaining army, along with remnants of the army from Cannae (who were considered to have been disgraced by the defeat and by surviving it), Marcellus camped near Suessula, a city in the region of Campania in southern Italy. At this point, part of the Carthaginian army began to make a move for the city of Nola. Marcellus repelled the attacks and managed to keep the city from the grasp of Hannibal. Although the battle at Nola was rather unimportant in regards to the Second Punic War as a whole, the victory was “important from its moral effect, as the first check, however slight, that Hannibal had yet received.”

Then, in 215 BC, Marcellus was summoned to Rome by the Dictator Marcus Junius Pera, who wanted to consult with him about the future conduct of the war. After this meeting, Marcellus was made proconsul. In the same year, when the consul Lucius Postumius Albinus was killed in battle, Marcellus was unanimously chosen by the Roman people to be his successor. Livy and Plutarch tell us a bad omen occurred, allegedly because the other consul was also a plebeian. Marcellus stepped aside and Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus took his place. Supposedly, the senate (interpreting the gods) disapproved of having two plebeian consuls. Marcellus was appointed proconsul, whereupon, he defended the city of Nola, once again, from the rear guard of Hannibal&#x27;s army. The following year, 214 BC, Marcellus was elected consul yet again, this time with Fabius Maximus. For a third time, Marcellus defended Nola from Hannibal and even captured the small but significant town of Casilinum.

===Sicily and Syracuse===
Following his victory at Casilinum, Marcellus was sent to Sicily, upon which Hannibal had set his sights. Upon arrival, Marcellus found the island in disarray. Hieronymus, the new ruler of the Roman-ally Kingdom of Syracuse, had recently come to the throne on his grandfather&#x27;s death and fallen under the influence of the Carthaginian agents Hippocrates and Epicydes. He then declared war against the Romans after the Carthaginian victory at the Battle of Cannae. However, Hieronymus was soon deposed; the new Syracusan leaders attempted a reconciliation with Rome, but could not quell their suspicions and then aligned themselves with the Carthaginians. In 214 BC, the same year that he was sent to Sicily, Marcellus attacked the city of Leontini, where the two Syracusan rulers were residing. After successfully storming the city, Marcellus had 2,000 Roman deserters (who had been hiding in the city) killed, and moved to lay siege to Syracuse itself. At this point, several cities in the province of Sicily rose in rebellion against Roman rule. The siege lasted for two years, partly because the Roman effort was thwarted by the military machines of the famous inventor Archimedes. Meanwhile, leaving the bulk of the Roman legion in the command of Appius Claudius at Syracuse, Marcellus and a small army roamed Sicily, conquering opponents and taking such rebellious cities as Helorus, Megara, and Herbessus.

After Marcellus returned and continued the siege, the Carthaginians attempted to relieve the city, but were driven back. Overcoming formidable resistance and the ingenious devices of Archimedes, the Romans finally took the city in the summer of 212 BC. Plutarch wrote that Marcellus, when he had previously entered the city for a diplomatic meeting with the Syracusans, had noticed a weak point in its fortifications. He made his attack at this fragile spot, using a night attack by a small group of hand-picked soldiers to storm the walls and open the gates. During the fighting, Archimedes was killed, an act Marcellus regretted. Plutarch writes that the Romans rampaged through the city, taking much of the plunder and artwork they could find. This has significance because Syracuse was a Greek city filled with Greek culture, art and architecture. Much of this Greek art was taken to Rome, where it was one of the first major impacts of Greek influence on Roman culture.

Following his victory at Syracuse, Marcellus remained in Sicily, where he defeated more Carthaginians and rebels. The important city of Agrigentum was still under Carthaginian control, though there was now little the Carthaginian leadership could do to support it, as the campaigns against the Romans in Spain and Italy now took precedence. At the end of 211 BC, Marcellus resigned from command of the Sicilian province, thereby putting the praetor of the region, Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, in charge. On his return to Rome, Marcellus did not receive the triumphal honours that would be expected for such a feat, as his political enemies objected that he had not fully eradicated the threats in Sicily.

== Death in battle ==
The final period of Marcus Claudius Marcellus’ life began with his fourth election to Roman consul in 210 BC. Marcellus’ election to office sparked much controversy and resentment towards Marcellus because of accusations by political opponents that his actions in Sicily were excessively brutal. Representatives of Sicilian cities presented themselves before the senate to complain about Marcellus&#x27; past actions. The complaints prevailed and Marcellus was forced to switch control of provinces with his colleague, so that Marcellus was not the consul in control of Sicily. On switching provinces, Marcellus took command of the Roman army in Apulia, leading it to many decisive victories against the Carthaginians. First, Marcellus took the city of Salapia and then continued along his way by conquering two cities in the region of Samnium. Next, when the army of Gnaeus Fulvius, another Roman general, was completely dismantled by Hannibal, Marcellus and his army stepped in to check the progress of the Carthaginian leader. Then Marcellus and Hannibal fought a battle at Numistro, where a clear victory could not be decided, although Rome claimed a victory. Following this battle, Marcellus continued to keep Hannibal in check, yet the two armies never met in a decisive battle. This can be seen as the result of a deliberate strategy of attrition warfare on Marcellus&#x27; part. (Attrition warfare as a strategy against Hannibal was originally pioneered by Marcellus&#x27;s friend, Fabius Maximus, who was given the (originally derogatory) nickname &quot;Cunctator&quot;, or &quot;the delayer&quot;.) Livy reports Marcellus describing the Carthaginians as &quot;the men whom you wore down in skirmishes...whose tracks you have dogged&quot;.

In 209 BC, Marcellus was named as a proconsul and retained control of his army. During that year, the Roman army under Marcellus faced Hannibal&#x27;s forces in a series of skirmishes and raids, without being drawn into open battle - Marcellus&#x27; particular strategy. Marcellus defended his actions and tactics in front of the senate and he was named a consul for the fifth time for the year 208 BC. After entering his fifth consulship Marcellus re-entered the field and took command of the army at Venusia. While on a reconnaissance mission with his colleagues Titus Quinctius Crispinus and Manius Aulius, and a small band of 220 horsemen, the group was ambushed and nearly completely slaughtered by a much larger Carthaginian force of Numidian horsemen. Marcellus was impaled by a spear and died on the field. In the following days, Crispinus died of his wounds.

When Hannibal heard of Marcellus&#x27; death he travelled to see the body, allowed Marcellus a proper funeral, and even sent the ashes back to Marcellus’ son in a silver urn with a golden wreath. According to Cornelius Nepos and Valerius Maximus the ashes never made it to his son but Augustus Caesar stated that the urn was delivered. The loss of both consuls was a major blow to Roman morale, as the Republic had lost its two senior military commanders in a single battle, while the formidable Carthaginian army was still at large in Italy.

== Historical significance ==
Marcus Claudius Marcellus&#x27; winning of the &quot;spolia opima&quot; earned him great fame in his lifetime. The &quot;spolia opima&quot; was one of the highest honors that could be bestowed on a Roman general. Plutarch informs us how the &quot;spolia opima&quot; was acquired, stating that, &quot;only those spoils are ‘&quot;opima’&quot; which are taken first, in a pitched battle, where general slays general.&quot; Only two others in Roman history, Romulus, the founder of Rome, and Aulus Cornelius Cossus, were allegedly honored with this prize. Marcellus is the only one of the three whose achievement has been historically confirmed. In terms of the history of the &quot;spolia opima&quot;, Marcellus holds great significance because he reinvigorated the meaning of the honored prize. Prior to Marcellus, the &quot;spolia opima&quot; was not of special importance in the minds of Romans because it had happened only twice before, if at all. Furthermore, the actual ritual of the &quot;spolia opima&quot; was not confirmed until Marcellus made it customary to dedicate the armor to Jupiter Feretrius. No one else accomplished the same feat to continue the tradition. In this way, Marcellus publicized the winning of the &quot;spolia opima&quot; and turned it into a legend.

Marcellus was an important general during the Second Punic War and his five-time election as a consul has its place in Roman history. His decisive victories in Sicily were of history-altering proportions, while his campaigns in Italy itself gave Hannibal himself pause and reinvigorated the Roman Senate. But it is Marcellus’ triumph as a warrior and winner of a &quot;spolia opima&quot; that confirmed his place in ancient Roman history. Due to all of this, he is known as the &quot;Sword of Rome&quot;. Plutarch also emphasized the service of Marcellus as &quot;the civilizer of Rome,&quot; one of the first to bring Greek art and learning to the Italian city.

<doc id="100689" wikidata="Q922786" url="?curid=100689" title="Layene">
<text>The Layene (also spelled Layène, Layenne, or Layeen) is a religious brotherhood of Sufi Muslims based in Senegal and founded in 1884 by Seydina Limamou Laye (1844-1909), who was born Limamou Thiaw. It is notable for its belief that their founder was the Mahdi (the reincarnation of Muhammad), and that his son, Seydina Issa Rouhou Laye, was the reincarnation of Jesus. 

==Overview==
The Layene community is open to all Muslims but was founded within the Lebu ethno-linguistic group, many of whom originally lived in fishing communities on the Cap-Vert peninsula on the northern edge of Dakar, Senegal. 

The Layene brotherhood is the smallest of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal and likely numbers between seventy and one-hundred thousand members. 

The community leader is known as the Khalif Générale, who also has broad authority over temporal matters in the Layene quarter of the neighborhood of Yoff, Senegal. Yoff is home to the Khalif, an elaborate mosque, the mausoleum of its founder, and of several of his descendants. There is a notable Layene mosque as well as a substantial Layene community in Cambérène, Senegal, where Seydina Issa Rouhou Laye is interred, and also in many other villages (like Malika, Yeumbeul, Ngor, Ouakam, Bargny). 

==Beliefs and practices==
Layene beliefs and practices include the normal five pillars of Islam, with some additional obligations recommended by Seydina Limamou Laye. For instance, prior to each of the five daily prayers, they wash not only their feet but up to their knees as well, and practice &quot;zikr&quot; before and after each prayer. 

They hold a weekly ceremony called the &quot;chants religieux&quot; that begins shortly before midnight on Saturday and continues until the dawn prayer on Sunday. The &quot;chants religieux&quot; consist of energetic sermons and loud zikr (Wolof: &quot;sikkar&quot;).

Many in the Layene community will arrange for their newborn daughters to be married at the time of their naming ceremonies, often to a young son of a friend. These marriages are binding, but when the children reach adulthood they are able to choose whether to continue in the marriage, or divorce (without stigma) and marry another community member or another person she chooses and loves. Newborn boys are circumcised on the day of their baptism (i.e. on the seventh day after birth). Many women choose to pray in the mosque for Friday prayer. There is a place for women to pray inside any Layene mosque, and children are also encouraged to pray in the mosque.

People in the community wear white during events. In addition, it is customary to take the symbolic last name &quot;Laye&quot; - derived from Allah - in order to flatten social hierarchies and support the teaching that all humans are equal in the eyes of God.

==Distribution==
Most Layenes live in the Cap-Vert area around Dakar, but there is a Layene presence in most other areas of Senegal, and a few live in Italy, France, Canada and the United States.

In 1812 the political independence of the Lebu from the Kingdom of Cayor was recognized. Today the Layene are granted special autonomy in the constitution, laws and practices of Senegal.

==History==
The Layene Brotherhood was founded in 1884 by Seydina Limamou Laye who was an uneducated man from the Lebu ethnic group, and a fisherman. He claimed to be the Mahdi, an Islamic messianic figure, whose coming is prophesied. He claimed his son, Seydina Issa Rouhou Laye, was the second coming of Jesus. Seydina Limamou Laye is reported to have said that when he left Mecca when he died, he took refuge in a cave in Ngor in the form of light. For more than a thousand years, he traveled the whole earth nightly to see in which people he would appear for his second mission, and “it is because of the moral discretion (&quot;sutura&quot;) and the decency of the clothing of the Lebu women that I was born among this people,” and that “God saw that I was born among the Lebus.” Despite this, from the earliest days of the community, membership has been open to all Muslims. He attracted a following both among and outside the Lebu ethno-linguistic group.

The present Khalif of the Layene is Seydina Mouhamadou Makhtar Laye, who is a son of Seydina Mandione Laye.

<text>Paul Albert Anka (born July 30, 1941) is a Canadian and American singer, songwriter and actor. His songs including &quot;Diana&quot;, “You Are My Destiny&quot;, “Lonely Boy&quot;, &quot;Put Your Head on My Shoulder&quot;, and &quot;(You&#x27;re) Having My Baby&quot;. 

Anka also wrote the theme for &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;; one of Tom Jones&#x27; biggest hits, &quot;She&#x27;s a Lady&quot;; and the English lyrics to Claude François and Jacques Revaux&#x27;s music for Frank Sinatra&#x27;s signature song &quot;My Way&quot;, which has been recorded by many, including Elvis Presley. He co-wrote three songs with Michael Jackson: &quot;This Is It&quot; (originally titled &quot;I Never Heard&quot;) &quot;Love Never Felt So Good&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Matter to Me&quot;, which became posthumous hits for Jackson in 2009, 2014, and 2018, respectively.

==Early life==
Paul Albert Anka was born in Ottawa, Ontario, to Camelia (née Tannis) and Andrew Emile &quot;Andy&quot; Anka Sr., who owned a restaurant called the Locanda. According to Anka&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;My Way&quot;, both of his parents were of Lebanese Christian descent; however, he also states in his autobiography that his ancestors came from Bab Tuma, in Syria. His father came to Canada from Damascus, Syria, and his mother was an immigrant from Lebanon. His mother died when he was 18.

Anka sang with the St. Elias Antiochian Orthodox Cathedral choir under the direction of Frederick Karam, with whom he studied music theory. He attended Fisher Park High School, where he was part of a vocal trio called the Bobby Soxers.

==Career==

===Early success===

Anka recorded his first single, &quot;I Confess&quot;, when he was 14. In 1956, with $100 given to him by his uncle, he went to New York City, where he auditioned for Don Costa at ABC Records, singing what was widely believed to be a lovestruck verse he had written to a former babysitter. In an interview with NPR&#x27;s Terry Gross in 2005, he stated that it was to a girl at his church whom he hardly knew. The resulting song &quot;Diana&quot; brought Anka stardom as it went to  1 on the Canadian and US music charts. &quot;Diana&quot; is one of the best selling singles ever by a Canadian recording artist. He followed up with four songs that made it into the Top 20 in 1958, including &quot;It&#x27;s Time to Cry&quot;, which hit  4 and &quot;(All of a Sudden) My Heart Sings&quot;, which reached  15, making him (at 17) one of the biggest teen idols of the time. He toured Britain, then Australia with Buddy Holly. Anka also wrote &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Matter Anymore&quot; – a song written for Holly, which Holly recorded just before he died in 1959. Anka stated shortly afterward:


Anka composed the theme for &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; (reworked in 1962 from a song Anka wrote earlier called &quot;Toot Sweet&quot;; it had been rewritten with lyrics and recorded by Annette Funicello in 1959 as &quot;It&#x27;s Really Love&quot;). He wrote &quot;Teddy&quot; – a Top 20 hit for Connie Francis in 1960. Anka wrote the English lyrics to &quot;My Way&quot;, Frank Sinatra&#x27;s signature song (originally the French song &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot;). In the 1960s, Anka began acting in motion pictures as well as writing songs for them, most notably the theme for the hit film &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (which also was the official march of the Canadian Airborne Regiment), in which he made a cameo appearance as a U.S. Army Ranger. For his film work he wrote and recorded one of his greatest hits &quot;Lonely Boy&quot;. He also wrote and recorded &quot;My Home Town&quot;, which was a  8 pop hit for him the same year. He then went on to become one of the first pop singers to perform at the Las Vegas casinos. In 1960, he appeared twice as himself in NBC&#x27;s short-lived crime drama &quot;Dan Raven&quot;.

In 1963, Anka purchased the rights and ownership of his ABC-Paramount catalog and re-recorded his earlier hits for RCA Victor, which he had joined in 1960.

===1970s chart comeback===

Frustrated after more than ten years without a top 25 hit record, Anka switched labels again, which marked a turning point in his career. This time he signed with United Artists and in 1974 teamed up with Odia Coates to record the  1 hit, &quot;(You&#x27;re) Having My Baby&quot;, exposing Anka to a new generation of fans and proving his staying power among his original fan base that was now maturing.

Anka also wrote five songs which were included on an album by Don Goodwin.

Anka and Coates would record three more duets that made it into the Top 10, &quot;One Man Woman/One Woman Man&quot; ( 7), &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like to Sleep Alone&quot; ( 8), and the  15 duet &quot;(I Believe) There&#x27;s Nothing Stronger Than Our Love&quot;. In 1975, he recorded a jingle for Kodak written by Bill Lane (lyrics) and Roger Nichols (melody) called &quot;Times of Your Life&quot;. It became so popular Anka recorded it as a full song, which peaked at  7 in the US pop chart in 1976. The follow-up was another hit that Anka wrote for Sinatra, &quot;Anytime (I&#x27;ll Be There)&quot;, peaking at  33. Anka&#x27;s last Top 40 hit in the US was in the summer of 1983: &quot;Hold Me &#x27;Til the Mornin&#x27; Comes&quot;, which included backing vocals from then-Chicago frontman Peter Cetera; it hit  2 on the Hot Adult Contemporary chart.

===1990s comeback===
Anka&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;A Body of Work&quot; was his first new US studio release since &quot;Walk a Fine Line&quot; in 1983; vocalists and performers included Celine Dion, Kenny G, Patti LaBelle, and Skyler Jett. The album included a new version of &quot;Hold Me &#x27;Til the Morning Comes&quot;, once again performed with Peter Cetera. In 2005, Anka released an album of big-band arrangements of contemporary Rock songs titled, &quot;Rock Swings&quot;; the album provided a mainstream comeback of sorts that saw Anka awarded a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto.

On October 12, 2009, Anka stated that Michael Jackson&#x27;s new release titled &quot;This Is It&quot; was a collaborative effort between the two in 1980. According to Anka, after recording the song, Jackson decided not to use it and the tune was then recorded and released by Sa-Fire. After Anka threatened to sue for credit and a share of royalties, the administrators of Jackson&#x27;s estate granted Anka 50% of the copyright. An additional song that Jackson co-wrote with Anka from this 1980 session, &quot;Love Never Felt So Good&quot;, was discovered shortly thereafter. His album &quot;Songs of December&quot; charted at  58 in Canada in November 2011.

===Italy===
Anka collaborated with a number of Italian musicians, including composer/director Ennio Morricone, singer-songwriter Lucio Battisti, and lyricist Mogol. His official discography reports nine singles released by RCA Italiana, but the Italian charts list at least six other songs he interpreted or recorded in Italian. His top hit was &quot;Ogni giorno&quot; which scored  1 in 1962, followed by &quot;Piangerò per te&quot; and &quot;Ogni volta&quot;, which reached both  2, in 1963 and 1964. &quot;Ogni volta&quot; (&quot;Every Time&quot;) was sung by Anka during the Festival di Sanremo of 1964 and then sold more than one million copies in Italy alone; it was also awarded a gold disc.

He returned to Sanremo in 1968 with &quot;La farfalla impazzita&quot; by Battisti-Mogol. On that occasion, the same title was interpreted by Italian crooner Johnny Dorelli. The pair of singers, however, were eliminated before the final stage of the musical contest. Anka, maybe only coincidentally, left the Italian scene shortly thereafter. In 2003, Anka came back with an exclusive concert in Bologna, organized by the Italian company Mapei during the CERSAIE exhibition. He recorded a version of &quot;My Way&quot; with alternate lyrics dedicated to the sponsor of the evening. 

In 2006, he recorded a duet with 1960s Italian hitmaker Adriano Celentano, a new cover of &quot;Diana&quot;, with Italian lyrics by Celentano-Mogol and with singer-songwriter Alex Britti on the guitar. The song hit  3.

===Finland===

Anka has been very popular in Finland since the beginning of his career. He performed in Helsinki&#x27;s Linnanmäki in 1959, in Lappeenranta in 1989, at the Pori Jazz Festival in Pori on 19 July 2007 and in 2012, and in Tampere three times on 6 August 2008 and on 9 and 10 August 2009. He also appeared in the Las Vegas scene in the 1991 Finnish film &quot;Prince of the Hit Parade&quot; (&quot;Iskelmäprinssi&quot;), directed by Juha Tapaninen. At the end of the film there is an archive footage of Anka&#x27;s performance in Linnanmäki. As background music, Anka performs his song &quot;How Long&quot; in the film.

===Other countries===
With less success than in Italy and Finland, Anka tried the French market as well, with his first song being &quot;Comme Avant&quot; with Mireille Mathieu. In 1964, he released an album titled &quot;Paul Anka à Paris&quot;; the six tracks on side B were sung in French. A single release in Japanese (&quot;Kokoro no Sasae&quot;/&quot;Shiawase e no Tabiji&quot;) is also reported on his discography. In 1993, he recorded a duet with Filipino singer Regine Velasquez titled &quot;It&#x27;s Hard to Say Goodbye&quot;, included on her album &quot;Reason Enough&quot;. This song was re-recorded several years later by Anka and Celine Dion and was included on his album &quot;A Body of Work&quot;.

Anka has performed four times in Israel, and in 2019 rejected pleas that he boycott the country.

==Acting career==

Anka&#x27;s first acting role in a major film was in a cameo as an army private in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962). He also composed the title song to the movie. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, he starred in such teen exploitation films as &quot;Girls Town&quot; (1959) and &quot;Look in Any Window&quot; (1961), in which he played a peeping tom. He later played an Elvis-hating casino pit manager in &quot;3000 Miles to Graceland&quot; (2001) and a yacht broker in &quot;Captain Ron&quot; (1992). He guest-starred as a murder suspect in one of the Perry Mason Made-for-TV movies, &quot;The Case of the Maligned Mobster&quot; (1991). He made guest appearances as himself in the episode &quot;Red&#x27;s Last Day&quot; on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; and in &quot;The Real Paul Anka&quot; episode of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. He made several appearances on the NBC TV series &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. In 2016, he made another guest appearance as himself in the &quot;Spring&quot; episode of &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot;, a revival of the original show.

===Other film and television appearances===
Anka was the subject of the 1962 National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;&quot;Lonely Boy&quot;&quot;, considered a classic work of cinéma vérité. He wrote and performed songs in the 1985 Canadian children&#x27;s Christmas cartoon &quot;George and the Christmas Star&quot;. He appeared on The Simpsons season 7 episode Treehouse of Horror VI, &quot;Attack of the 50 Ft Eyesore&quot;, singing a song with Lisa in October 1995. In &quot;American Idol&quot;″s seasons 2 and 3, he made a special appearance and sang an adapted version of &quot;My Way&quot; that mocked the format of the show, as well as participants, judges, and the host. The performance was praised as one of the best moments of the show. He also played the role of Buddy Maus in Season 2 Episode 14 &quot;The Betrayal&quot; of the TV show &quot;Kojak&quot;. 

Anka appeared in an episode of The Morecambe and Wise Show in 1970, singing his own lyrics &#x27;My Way&#x27;. The show was broadcast again on BBC2 on Christmas Day 2021 after the tape recording - believed lost - was found.

Anka appeared as himself in the American sitcom &quot;That 70s Show&quot; in season 2, episode 2 &quot;Red’s Last Day&quot;.

On &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, Lorelai Gilmore named her Polish Lowland Sheepdog after Anka. Series co-creator Daniel Palladino chose the name after hearing the &quot;Rock Swings&quot; album at a coffeehouse. Both Paul Ankas were featured in a dream sequence Lorelai describes to her daughter Rory in the cold open to &quot;The Real Paul Anka&quot;, the eighteenth episode of Season 6.

Anka competed in season four of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Broccoli&quot;. He ended up finishing in 7th place during the Group C finals.

==Personal life==

Anka was married to Anne de Zogheb, the half-English and half-Lebanese daughter of Lebanese diplomat Charles de Zogheb, from February 16, 1963, until 2001. The couple met in 1962 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she was a fashion model on assignment and under contract to the Eileen Ford Agency. Zogheb, brought up in Egypt, is of Lebanese, English, French, Dutch, and Greek descent. The couple married the following year in a ceremony at Paris-Orly Airport. Through his daughter Amanda, he is the father-in-law of the actor Jason Bateman.

On September 6, 1990, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

In 2008, Anka married his personal trainer, Anna Åberg, in Sardinia, Italy. They divorced in 2010, and Paul has full custody of their son. Anna was featured in the Swedish TV3 show &quot;Svenska Hollywoodfruar&quot; (&quot;Swedish Hollywood Wives&quot;).

Anka&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;My Way&quot;, co-written with David Dalton, was published in 2013.
In October 2016, Anka married Lisa Pemberton in Beverly Hills, California. They divorced in 2020.

==Awards and honours==

In 1972, a street in Ottawa was named Paul Anka Drive. In 1981, the Ottawa City Council named August 26 as &quot;Paul Anka Day&quot; to celebrate his quarter-century in show business.

== In popular culture ==
In the mid-1980s, Anka was secretly recorded while launching a tirade against his crew and band members, berating them for behavior that he considered unprofessional. When asked about it on the interview program &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, he referred to the person who did the recording as a &quot;snake we later fired&quot;. The recording became widely known after being uploaded to the internet around 2004, and a number of quotes from it became famous, including &quot;The guys get shirts!&quot;; &quot;Don&#x27;t make a maniac out of me!&quot;; and &quot;Slice like a f*****g hammer&quot;. Some of the quotes were reproduced verbatim by Al Pacino&#x27;s character in the 2007 film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot;. In the TV show &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, Lorelai Gilmore names her dog Paul Anka.

==Business ventures==

In 2012, Anka co-founded the holographic tech startup, ARHT Media. He is currently a member of ARHT Media&#x27;s Board of Advisors, alongside Kevin O&#x27;Leary and Brian Mulroney until the latter&#x27;s death in February, 2024.

==Early life and education==
Denzel Hayes Washington Jr. was born in Mount Vernon, New York, on December 28, 1954. His mother, Lennis &quot;Lynne&quot; (Lowe), was a beauty parlor owner and operator born in Georgia and partly raised in Harlem, New York. His father, Denzel Hayes Washington Sr., a native of Buckingham County, Virginia, was an ordained Pentecostal minister who was also an employee of the New York City Water Department, and worked at a local S. Klein department store.

Washington attended Pennington-Grimes Elementary School in Mount Vernon until 1968. When he was 14, his parents divorced and his mother sent him to the private preparatory school Oakland Military Academy in New Windsor, New York. Washington later said, &quot;That decision changed my life, because I wouldn&#x27;t have survived in the direction I was going. The guys I was hanging out with at the time, my running buddies, have now done maybe 40 years combined in the penitentiary. They were nice guys, but the streets got them.&quot; After Oakland, he attended Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, Florida, from 1970 to 1971.

He was interested in attending Texas Tech University: &quot;I grew up in the Boys Club in Mount Vernon, and we were the Red Raiders. So when I was in high school, I wanted to go to Texas Tech in Lubbock just because they were called the Red Raiders and their uniforms looked like ours.&quot; Instead, he earned a BA in Drama and Journalism from Fordham University in 1977. At Fordham, he played collegiate basketball as a guard under coach P. J. Carlesimo. After a period of indecision on which major to study and taking a semester off, Washington worked as creative arts director of the overnight summer camp at Camp Sloane YMCA in Lakeville, Connecticut. He participated in a staff talent show for the campers and a colleague suggested he try acting.

Returning to Fordham that fall with a renewed purpose, Washington enrolled at the Lincoln Center campus to study acting, where he was cast in the title roles in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;. He then attended graduate school at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, California, where he stayed for one year before returning to New York to begin a professional acting career.

==Career==
=== 1976–1989: Early roles and rise to prominence ===
Washington spent the summer of 1976 in St. Mary&#x27;s City, Maryland, in summer stock theater performing &quot;Wings of the Morning&quot;, the Maryland State play, which was written for him by incorporating an African-American character/narrator based loosely on the historical figure from early colonial Maryland, Mathias de Sousa.

Shortly after graduating from Fordham, Washington made his screen acting debut in the 1977 made-for-television film &quot;Wilma&quot; which was a docudrama about sprinter Wilma Rudolph, and made his first Hollywood appearance in the 1981 film &quot;Carbon Copy&quot;. He shared a 1982 Distinguished Ensemble Performance Obie Award for playing Private First Class Melvin Peterson in the Off-Broadway Negro Ensemble Company production &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Play&quot; which premiered November 20, 1981. 

A major career break came when he starred as Dr. Phillip Chandler in NBC&#x27;s television hospital drama &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, which ran from 1982 to 1988. He was one of only a few African-American actors to appear on the series for its entire six-year run. He also appeared in several television, motion picture and stage roles, such as the films &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot; (1984), &quot;Hard Lessons&quot; (1986) and &quot;Power&quot; (1986). In 1987, he starred as South African anti-apartheid political activist Stephen Biko in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Cry Freedom&quot;, for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

In 1989, Washington won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of a defiant, self-possessed ex-slave soldier in the film &quot;Glory&quot;. That same year, he appeared in the film &quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot;; and in &quot;For Queen and Country&quot;, where he played the conflicted and disillusioned Reuben James, a British soldier who, despite a distinguished military career, returns to a civilian life where racism and inner-city life lead to vigilantism and violence.

=== 1990–1999: Hollywood stardom and acclaim ===
In the summer of 1990, Washington had appeared in the title role of the Public Theater&#x27;s production of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;. Mel Gussow of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Washington as &quot;an actor of range and intensity, is expert at projecting a feeling of controlled rage&quot;. Also that year Washington starred as Bleek Gilliam in the Spike Lee film &quot;Mo&#x27; Better Blues&quot;. Charles Murray of &quot;Empire&quot; praised Washington&#x27;s performance as a &quot;taut portrayal of the driven musician&quot; and &quot;like all Lee’s film, Mo’ Better Blues is a real ensemble piece, and the standard of the performances is uniformly excellent: but Washington [and] Lee deserve extra plaudits.&quot; In 1991, he starred as Demetrius Williams in the Mira Nair directed romantic drama &quot;Mississippi Masala&quot; opposite Sarita Choudhury. Set primarily in rural Mississippi, the film explores interracial romance between African Americans and Indian Americans. Critic Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised the chemistry of the two leads writing, &quot;Washington is an actor of immense and natural charm, and he makes a good match with Sarita Choudhury&quot;.

Washington was reunited with Lee to play one of his most critically acclaimed roles, the title character of the historical epic &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1992). &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film it&#x27;s Critic&#x27;s Pick with Vincent Canby declaring, &quot;In Denzel Washington it also has a fine actor who does for &quot;Malcolm X&quot; what Ben Kingsley did for &quot;Gandhi&quot;. Mr. Washington not only looks the part, but he also has the psychological heft, the intelligence and the reserve to give the film the dramatic excitement&quot;. His performance as the Black nationalist leader earned him another nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Also that year, he established the production company Mundy Lane Entertainment. The next year, he played the lawyer defending a gay man with AIDS played by Tom Hanks in the Jonathan Demme film &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993). &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; wrote, &quot;Casting Washington in the lead guaranteed the film the black audience that otherwise might not have had much interest in the problems of a rich white homosexual with Aids. But Aids is rampant in inner cities, where it attacks not just gay men, but IV drug users and women.&quot;

During the early and mid-1990s, Washington starred in several successful thrillers, including &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; with Julia Roberts in 1993, and &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; with Gene Hackman in 1995, as well as the Shakespearean comedy &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; directed by Kenneth Branagh. In 1996, he played a U.S. Army officer who investigates a female chopper commander&#x27;s worthiness for the Medal of Honor in &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot;, opposite Meg Ryan. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;All of [the] predicaments are palpably and convincingly registered through Washington’s probing, reserved and sensitively drawn performance in a role that, in another era, might have been played by the likes of a Montgomery Clift or William Holden.&quot;

In 1996, he starred alongside Whitney Houston, and Courtney B. Vance in the romantic comedy &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; directed by Penny Marshall. The film is a remake of the 1947 film &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; starring Cary Grant, Loretta Young, and David Niven. In 1998, Washington starred in Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;He Got Game&quot;. Washington played a father serving a six-year prison term when the prison warden offers him a temporary parole to convince his top-ranked high-school basketball player son (Ray Allen) to sign with the governor&#x27;s alma mater, Big State. The film was Washington&#x27;s third collaboration with Lee. The same year he starred in Gregory Hoblit&#x27;s supernatural horror film &quot;Fallen&quot; (1998) with John Goodman, James Gandolfini, and Donald Sutherland.

In 1999, Washington acted alongside Angelina Jolie in the crime thriller &quot;The Bone Collector&quot;. That same year, Washington starred in &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, a film about boxer Rubin &#x27;Hurricane&#x27; Carter, whose conviction for triple murder was overturned after he spent almost 20 years in prison. Although less successful at the box office than &quot;The Bone Collector&quot;, &quot;Hurricane&quot; had a better reception from critics. He received a Silver Bear Award at the Berlin International Film Festival for his role as Carter. Roger Ebert, film critic for &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, wrote of Washington&#x27;s performance, &quot;This is one of Denzel Washington&#x27;s great performances, on a par with his work in &quot;Malcolm X&quot;.&quot;

=== 2000–2009: Established actor and action roles ===

At the 57th Golden Globe Awards in 2000, Washington won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for his work in &quot;The Hurricane&quot;. He was the first black actor to win the award since Sidney Poitier in 1963. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; declared, &quot;Washington gives a penetrating portrait of life at its most extreme. He takes the viewer into the mind of a man experiencing confinement and physical deprivation. More profoundly, he shows what it&#x27;s like to deal every day with the torments of wild rage and impotence, despair and hope.&quot; In 2000, he portrayed Herman Boone, the high school football coach in the Disney sports drama film &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; which grossed over US$100 million in the U.S. Andrew O&#x27;Hehir of &quot;Salon&quot; wrote, &quot;Washington is of course the linchpin of &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;; he&#x27;s a commanding actor in a commanding role, and as memorable as he was in &quot;The Hurricane&quot;.

Washington starred in the Antoine Fuqua directed crime thriller &quot;Training Day&quot; (2001) acting opposite Ethan Hawke. He portrayed Detective Alonzo Harris, a corrupt Los Angeles cop. Roger Ebert wrote of his performance, &quot;For Denzel Washington, [it is] a rare villainous role; he doesn&#x27;t look, sound or move like his usual likable characters...he&#x27;s like a monster from a horror film, unkillable and implacable.&quot; Washington won an Academy Award for Best Actor becoming the second African-American actor to win the category after Poitier, who was presented with an Honorary Academy Award the same night. He also received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.

In 2002, he starred in the Nick Cassavettes directed healthcare-themed drama &quot;John Q.&quot; (2002) portraying John Quincy Archibald. Washington acted opposite James Woods, Robert Duvall, and Ray Liotta. The film was a financial success but received mixed reviews with critics praising Washington&#x27;s performances. BBC film critic Neil Smith wrote, &quot;What credibility there is comes from Washington&#x27;s intense, humane performance and the supporting players&#x27; sterling attempts to rise above the stereotypical roles with which they have been saddled.&quot; That same year Washington directed his first film, a well-reviewed drama called &quot;Antwone Fisher&quot; (2002), in which he also co-starred as a Navy psychiatrist. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised his direction writing, &quot;Mr. Washington shows a confident grasp of cinematic narrative in a hearty meat-and-potatoes style. But the most remarkable aspect of his behind-the-camera debut is his brilliantly surefooted handling of actors.&quot; He also praised his acting adding, &quot;[He] is so sensitively reactive that his performance seems more lived than acted&quot;.
Between 2003 and 2006, Washington appeared in a series of thrillers that performed generally well at the box office, including Carl Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Out of Time&quot; opposite Eva Mendez and Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;Man on Fire&quot; alongside Dakota Fanning. In 2004 he acted opposite Meryl Streep in the remake of the 1962 film of the same name, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;. In 2006, he starred in &quot;Inside Man&quot;, a Spike Lee-directed bank heist thriller co-starring Jodie Foster and Clive Owen. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, it&#x27;s &quot;flashy cast, clever script and vibrant showcasing of New York City are strong plusses for Spike Lee&#x27;s most mainstream studio venture&quot;. Later that year he starred in the time travel movie &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; released in November.

In 2005, he was back onstage playing Brutus in the Broadway revival of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. Theatre critic Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Washington does not embarrass himself, as leading citizens of Hollywood have been known to do on Broadway. But even brilliantined in the glow of his inescapable fame, he can&#x27;t help getting lost amid the wandering, mismatched crowd and the heavy topical artillery that have been assembled here.&quot; Despite mixed reviews, the production&#x27;s limited run was a consistent sell-out. In 2007, he co-starred with Russell Crowe for the second time (the first was 1995&#x27;s &quot;Virtuosity&quot;) in Ridley Scott&#x27;s crime drama &quot;American Gangster&quot; for which he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama nomination. He also directed and starred in the drama &quot;The Great Debaters&quot; with Forest Whitaker. He next appeared in Tony Scott&#x27;s 2009 film &quot;The Taking of Pelham 123&quot; (a remake of the 1974 thriller of the same name), where he played New York City subway security chief Walter Garber opposite John Travolta&#x27;s villain.

=== 2010–2019: Return to theater and &quot;The Equalizer&quot; trilogy ===

Washington returned to Broadway playing Troy Maxson, opposite Viola Davis, in the revival of August Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Fences&quot; (2010). Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Washington has the fluid naturalness we associate with good screen actors... face and stance alone provide fascinating (and damning) glimpses into Troy’s attitudes toward his son from an earlier relationships&quot;. Washington won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play on June 13, 2010. That same year, Washington starred in &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; (2010), a post-apocalyptic action-drama set in the near future. Also in 2010, he starred as a veteran railroad engineer in the action film &quot;Unstoppable&quot;, about an unmanned, half-mile-long runaway freight train carrying dangerous cargo. The film was his fifth and final collaboration with director Tony Scott, following &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; (1995), &quot;Man on Fire&quot; (2004), &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Taking of Pelham 123&quot; (2009).

In 2012, Washington starred in &quot;Flight&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as an alcoholic airline pilot facing investigation for his part in a plane crash. He co-starred with Ryan Reynolds in &quot;Safe House&quot;, where he prepared for his role by subjecting himself to a torture session that included waterboarding. In 2013, Washington starred in &quot;2 Guns&quot;, alongside Mark Wahlberg. From April to June 2014, Washington played the leading role in the Broadway production of Lorraine Hansberry&#x27;s classic drama &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot;, directed by Kenny Leon. The show received positive reviews and won the 2014 Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play. That same year he starred in &quot;The Equalizer&quot; (2014), an action thriller film directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by Richard Wenk, based on the television series of same name starring Edward Woodward. He reprised his role in his first sequel, &quot;The Equalizer 2&quot; (2018) and the third and final sequel &quot;The Equalizer 3&quot; (2023).

In 2016, Washington starred in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, a remake of the 1960 western film of the same name, alongside Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio, Lee Byung-hun, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier, Haley Bennett, and Peter Sarsgaard. Principal photography began on May 18, 2015, in north Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The film premiered on September 8 at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, and was released in the United States in conventional and IMAX theaters on September 23, 2016. In &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, Washington plays Sam Chisolm (&quot;the Bounty Hunter&quot;), a duly sworn warrant officer from Wichita, Kansas. His character was renamed from Chris Adams (played by Yul Brynner in the original film) to Sam Chisolm. It is Washington&#x27;s first Western film. Washington did not watch Westerns growing up, as it was the end of the Western era in the movies. Moreover, he and his siblings were barred from going to the cinema by his father, a minister in a church. They grew up watching Biblical films instead, like &quot;King of Kings&quot; and &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, although he has said that he watched portions of the shows &quot;Rawhide&quot; and &quot;Bonanza&quot;. He did not view the original film in preparation, but has watched &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. Fuqua flew to New York City to negotiate with Washington, who accepted the offer.
In 2016, Washington directed the film &quot;Fences&quot;, co-starring Viola Davis and Stephen McKinley Henderson and based on August Wilson&#x27;s play of the same name, with a script by Wilson. Set in 1950s Pittsburgh, Washington plays a former Negro league baseball player working as a garbage collector who struggles to provide for his family and come to terms with the events of his life. The film was released on December 16, 2016, by Paramount Pictures. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Washington, as both actor and director, gets the conversation humming with a speed and alacrity that keeps the audience jazzed...Washington tears through it with a joyful ferocity, like a man possessed.&quot; For his performance, Washington was nominated in the Best Actor category for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award. The film was nominated for three other Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, and won Davis her first Oscar, in the Best Supporting Actress category.

The following year, Washington starred in the legal drama film &quot;Roman J. Israel, Esq.&quot; (2017). Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;[He]&#x27;s a star player, styling out his character’s complicated and tricky mix of attributes...However contrived, this character is always fully and comfortably inhabited, and Washington brings off the funny moments&quot;. While the film received mixed reviews, his performance was praised by critics and led to nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and an Academy Award, Washington&#x27;s ninth Oscar nomination overall, and his sixth for Best Actor.

Beginning March 22, 2018, Washington starred as Theodore &quot;Hickey&quot; Hickman in a Broadway revival of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;. The production, directed by George C. Wolfe, began regular performances April 26 and ran for 14 weeks. Washington received positive reviews with Alexis Soloski of &quot;The Guardian&quot; writing, &quot;For most of it, Washington is playing Washington, letting his good looks and irrepressible charm do most of the character work, though the play’s most exciting moments are when he lets that charm falter (something he’s also been exploring in his recent film work, too) showing something uglier and more ravaged underneath.&quot;

===2020–present===
In 2020, he produced the Netflix film adaptation of the August Wilson play &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot; starring Chadwick Boseman and Viola Davis. The film was directed by George C. Wolfe and received positive reviews. The following year he portrayed Deputy Sheriff Joe &quot;Deke&quot; Deacon in the crime thriller &quot;The Little Things&quot; acting opposite Rami Malek and Jared Leto. The film was released during the COVID-19 pandemic and was released in theaters and on HBO Max. Also in 2021, Washington portrayed the titular character in the 2021 film adaptation of the William Shakespeare tragedy &quot;Macbeth&quot;. He received universal acclaim for his performance and was nominated for several awards, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. That same year, Washington directed the drama &quot;A Journal for Jordan&quot;, based on the memoir &quot;A Journal for Jordan: A Story of Love and Honor&quot; by Dana Canedy. It received a wide theatrical release on December 25, 2021 and received mixed reviews from critics.

In 2023, Washington was cast in Ridley Scott&#x27;s epic historical drama &quot;Gladiator II&quot; alongside Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, and Derek Jacobi. The film is a sequel to Scott&#x27;s &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000). In 2024, Washington served as a producer of &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;, the Netflix film adaptation of the August Wilson play of the same name starring John David Washington, Danielle Deadwyler, and Samuel L. Jackson. Washington was also cast as Carthaginian general Hannibal in an upcoming Netflix film; the decision was controversial in Tunisia.

In 2024, Washington was set to reunite with Spike Lee on the police procedural drama film &quot;High and Low&quot;, a remake of the 1963 Akira Kurosawa film of the same name. The film will be a joint production with A24 and Apple TV+ and will also star Jeffrey Wright and Ilfenesh Hadera.

Washington is a Pentecostal Evangelical Christian and a member of the West Angeles Church of God in Christ, located in Los Angeles. He has considered becoming a preacher. He stated in 1999, &quot;A part of me still says, &#x27;Maybe, Denzel, you&#x27;re supposed to preach. Maybe you&#x27;re still compromising.&#x27; I&#x27;ve had an opportunity to play great men and, through their words, to preach. I take what talent I&#x27;ve been given seriously, and I want to use it for good.&quot; In 1995, he donated to help build the new West Angeles Church of God in Christ facility in Los Angeles.

In mid-2004, Washington visited Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) at Fort Sam Houston, where he participated in a Purple Heart ceremony, presenting medals to three Army soldiers recovering from wounds they received while stationed in Iraq. He also visited the fort&#x27;s Fisher House facilities, and after learning that it had exceeded its capacity, made a substantial donation to the Fisher House Foundation; this program focuses on building and providing homes for military personnel and their families free of charge while they receive medical care. Washington&#x27;s other charitable contributions include to Nelson Mandela&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Fund in 1995 and to Wiley College to resuscitate the college&#x27;s debate team.

<doc id="100696" wikidata="Q822339" url="?curid=100696" title="New Jersey Route 31">
<text>Route 31 is a state highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs from US 206/US 1 Bus. in Trenton, Mercer County, north to an intersection with US 46 in the Buttzville section of White Township, Warren County. Along the way, Route 31 heads through the communities of Flemington, Clinton, and Washington. Most of the highway is state-maintained; however, the section within the city limits of Trenton is maintained by the city. Much of Route 31 is a two-lane highway that passes through farmland, woodland, and mountainous areas. Two portions of the route—from Trenton to Pennington and from Ringoes to Clinton—consist of more development.

The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. Route 31 has carried two different numbers in the past. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with US 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69. There were plans made in the late 1960s and early 1970s to build a freeway in the Route 31 corridor that would begin in the Trenton area and extend as far north as Interstate 84 (I-84) in Port Jervis, New York; however, it was canceled in the mid-1970s due to opposition from area residents and environmental and financial constraints. In recent years, the portion of Route 31 between Flemington and Clinton has been widened to four lanes. In addition, there was a failed project to build a bypass of Flemington that would have also eliminated the Flemington Circle.

==Route description==

Route 31 heads north from US 1 Bus./US 206 at the Trenton Battle Monument in Trenton, Mercer County, on city-maintained two-lane undivided Pennington Road. The route passes by residences and some businesses in the northern part of Trenton, crossing the intersection with Calhoun Street (CR 653). Route 31 enters Ewing and becomes state-mantainted at the point where it crosses the intersection with Parkway Avenue (County Route 634 [CR 634]). The route continues north through suburban residential areas and passes to the west of the TCNJ campus. It crosses into Hopewell Township and briefly becomes a four-lane divided highway as it intersects I-295. Past this interchange, Route 31 continues north as an undivided road through a mix of residences with some businesses, meeting the intersection with Washington Crossing–Pennington Road/Blackwell Road (CR 546) and Pennington Road (CR 640) at a traffic circle. It continues past the circle as a two-lane, undivided road and bypasses Pennington to the west. The route briefly skirts into Pennington twice, where it is a divided highway as it crosses over CSX&#x27;s Trenton Subdivision railroad line. Route 31 enters Pennington again before heading back into Hopewell Township. Here, the road meets the intersection with North Main Street (CR 640) and heads north into farmland and woodland with some homes. It eventually turns to the northwest and crosses the intersection with Lambertville–Hopewell Road (CR 518).
Upon crossing the intersection with Lambertville–Hopewell Road (CR 518), Route 31 enters East Amwell, Hunterdon County, and continues through rural areas. The route eventually forms the border between East Amwell and West Amwell and intersects with Harbourton Road (CR 579). The two routes run concurrently to the northwest, becoming a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane that crosses entirely into East Amwell before resuming along the border of East and West Amwell townships. The road becomes a divided highway and crosses entirely into East Amwell again before it comes to an interchange with US 202, where CR 579 continues north into Ringoes and Route 31 heads north along US 202, a four-lane, divided highway with intersections featuring jughandle ramps.

US 202/Route 31 heads to the north, coming to an intersection with Old York Road, which heads to the southwest as Route 179 and to the northeast as CR 514. Past this intersection, the road forms the border between East Amwell to the west and Raritan Township to the east before crossing entirely into Raritan Township. The road continues north through farms, reaching commercial development as it approaches the Flemington area. The road widens to six lanes and crosses into Flemington. The road comes to the Flemington Circle where US 202 continues to the northeast, Route 12 heads to the west, and Route 31 continues to the north on a five-lane, undivided road.
The route crosses back into Raritan Township, where it passes under the Black River &amp; Western Railroad and briefly becomes a four-lane divided highway before reentering Flemington. Not long afterward, it heads into Raritan Township again, where it crosses the intersection with Walter E. Foran Boulevard (CR 523) and passes by the former site of Flemington Speedway, now a commercial development called Raritan Town Square. Route 31 passes through suburban development before turning into a four-lane, divided highway with some intersections controlled by jughandles and crossing over Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Lehigh Line and the South Branch of the Raritan River into Readington. It continues north through a mix of farms and wooded areas with some residential areas, crossing into Clinton Township.

Route 31 comes to an interchange with I-78/US 22, with a park and ride lot located to the northwest of the interchange. Past here, the route turns to the northwest into a more developed setting and has an interchange with Route 173. The road runs through Clinton, where it crosses the South Branch Raritan River again. Back in Clinton Township, Route 31 intersects with Halsted Street (CR 513), forming a concurrency with that route and running along the eastern shore of Spruce Run Reservoir. CR 513 splits from Route 31 by heading north on West Main Street, and Route 31 continues north, narrowing to a two-lane undivided road. The route crosses into Lebanon Township, where it heads northwest across the wooded Musconetcong Mountains. Route 31 passes through Glen Gardner, which it enters upon crossing Sprunce Run, before heading into Hampton, where it heads west through that community as a three-lane road with two southbound lanes and one northbound lane and passes over an abandoned railroad line.
Route 31 crosses the Musconetcong River into Washington Township, Warren County, where it heads north into the agricultural Musconetcong Valley. It heads into Washington Borough, where the road becomes four lanes, passing under the Washington Secondary railroad line that is owned by Norfolk Southern and operated by the Dover and Delaware River Railroad and crossing the intersection with Washington Avenue (Route 57). Past the intersection with Washington Avenue (Route 57), Route 31 narrows to three lanes, passing under the Dover and Delaware River Railroad line, and becomes a two-lane road again as it crosses back into Washington Township at the intersection with Essex Road. It heads into farmland before turning northwest and heading across the Oxford Mountain, entering Mansfield Township. While crossing the Oxford Mountain, Route 31 skirts along the border between Mansfield Township and Washington Township. The route enters Oxford Township, where it heads through the community of Oxford as a four-lane road. Route 31 continues north through a mix of woods and agricultural areas past Oxford, crossing into White Township at the intersection with East Quarry Road and coming to its northern terminus at the intersection with US 46.

==History==
=== Old roads and construction ===

Before the state received ownership of Route 31, the portion of the highway from Clinton to Oxford was part of the Spruce Run Turnpike. The turnpike was chartered by the New Jersey State Assembly on February 6, 1813, and was maintained and tolled by the Spruce Run Turnpike Company. The turnpike served as a connector along the old Hopewell Road from modern-day Lambertville (then called Georgetown) to New Brunswick. The road also served as a highly used connector route for the Jersey and Castenoga wagon lines, which served both of the aforementioned communities. The route from Trenton to Pennington was part of the Pennington Turnpike, another privately maintained pre-designation highway. The turnpike was chartered on March 17, 1854, by the General Assembly along an alignment of the old Pennington Road. The turnpike road was to be constructed no further than in breadth, and to be made out of stone, plank or gravel. The turnpike cost one cent for every carriage or sled pulled by horses or mules (and one cent more for every animal), five mills for horse and rider and every dozen of pigs and sheep. It cost two cents to move a dozen cattle, mules or horses. Fines were levied as high as $10 (equivalent to $ in ) to anyone who vandalized any structure along the turnpike. If the company did not construct their highway in six years, the state would then take over and make it a public highway. On November 1, 1898, the turnpike, made mostly of stone, was taken over by the state at a cost of $31,661.87 (equivalent to $ in ). Repairs were slated to be completed on the road by October 31, 1899. Also on March 17, 1854, the state legislature made the charter official for the Hopewell and Ewing Turnpike, which used the portion of Route 31 from Pennington to the current-day intersection with CR 654. The turnpike was taken over by the state in 1897 and the privately maintained company was dissolved.

The formation of current-day Route 31 began around 1916, when a portion of the highway, along the community of Hampton was taken over by the state and was repaired to state standards for $300 (equivalent to $ in ). In 1923, the state of New Jersey passed the Good Roads Act, which greatly expanded the state highway system in New Jersey. This act took over pre-existing highways and rebuilt them to a standard mandated by the state. Construction began on Route 31 in 1926, when the State Highway Department began work at the southern terminus in Trenton. A total of 11 bridges were constructed along the highway during this time, signifying the route&#x27;s construction northward. The oldest ones, dating back to 1926, were located in Ewing and Oxford Township. The one in Ewing was along the first portion of the highway to be constructed.

By 1929, the construction had reached Lawrence Township, where another long stretch of highway was built. During 1930, the construction had reached Clinton, Glen Gardener, and Washington. Construction of the highway progressed northbound, with sections of the Mercer-Hunterdon-Warren route reaching Hunterdon County in 1931. The Hunterdon County portion up to the Musconetcong River was constructed for six months, with completion in October 1931. Construction of the highway northward from the Musconetcong River started in October of the same year. The mainline construction reached the northern terminus in Buttzville in 1932. The route, although the construction had reached its northern end, was not complete due to bypasses around Clinton and Pennington were proposed to be built. These bypasses were never constructed, and during 1934, more portions of the highway in Hunterdon County were finished. The route was completed in 1935, providing an uninterrupted route from the capital city of Trenton to northern Warren County.

=== Designation ===

What is today Route 31 was defined in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering as Route 30, a highway that began in Trenton and ended in Buttzville. In the 1953 renumbering, Route 30 was renumbered as Route 69, as the number conflicted with US 30 in southern New Jersey. The bypass of Ringoes, shared with US 202, opened in the 1960s. Due to the sexual meaning of the number and resulting sign theft, Route 69 was changed on June 5, 1967, to Route 31 beginning with sign swapping by state crews. The justification for the removal was that people were stealing signs as a trophy for dorm rooms because of their interest in the number 69.

A limited-access freeway was once planned to serve traffic along the Route 31 (then Route 69) corridor. Plans came forth in the 1960s for a highway to run along Route 69 from the in-construction US 1 freeway (then designated Route 174) to the US 202 freeway in Ringoes. The estimated cost to build the highway according to the proposal estimated to $18 million (equivalent to $ in ), with construction completing in 1975.
There were plans to extend the freeway further in both directions, including northward to I-80 in Hope Township and southward to I-195. Each of these two extensions were brought forth in the 1960s, and were later shelved due to lack of support. In the early 1970s, a extension of Route 31 was proposed from Oxford, connecting the highway with the proposed Route 23 freeway to I-84 near Port Jervis, New York. This northern freeway extension of Route 31 was to be known as Route F-31 and the Foothills Freeway, and was to run through the Kittatinny Mountains, passing through Stokes State Forest and High Point State Park. The proposal gave an estimated price tag of about $105 million (equivalent to $ in ). The northern freeway faced high opposition from residents living in Warren and Sussex counties, who feared environmental damage. A group called Opponents of the Foothills Freeway formed to prevent the road from being built. Along with the growing opposition, environmental and financial issues arose, causing the New Jersey Department of Transportation to cancel the Route 31 from being built mid-1970s.

Following the completion of New Jersey&#x27;s portion of I-287 in 1993, more out-of-state tractor trailer drivers began to use the alignment of Route 31 as a toll-free alternative to the New Jersey Turnpike. On July 16, 1999, oversize trucks were banned from using Route 31 as part of a larger statewide ban imposed on New Jersey roads not a part of the National Highway System by Governor Christine Todd Whitman. The legislation had a significant effect on trucks that followed Route 31 as it forced them to use I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike instead. In the mid-2000s, the portion of Route 31 was widened during extensive construction between Flemington and Clinton that widened the road to four lanes.

=== The South Branch Parkway ===

In 2005, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) introduced a case study for Route 31 for its &quot;New Jersey: Future in Transportation&quot; project. Over time, the residents and business owners of Raritan Township and Flemington had growing concerns over the congestion along the highway and US 202. After trying to use vacant land to the east of the current alignment, NJDOT put forth the Flemington Bypass, trying to relieve congestion on Route 31 along the commercial district and to provide access to the industrial land between the two highways and the South Branch of the Raritan River. The project was never completed and the proposed site remains undeveloped. NJDOT is now looking at a scaled-down bypass, proposed as the South Branch Parkway, to connect Route 31 to US 202 in Flemington.

The parkway was to be built as a two-lane alternative to Route 31 defining the border of the suburban and rural portions of Flemington and Raritan Township. Along with the new parkway, a brand-new local street network was proposed to help support the new alignment. These would minimize the pressure of traffic on Route 31 and include better roads for bicycles and pedestrians. More direct routes to different portions of the community would be provided to maintain the community&#x27;s character. The proposed parkway was to also help upgrade the sensitive history along the river. According to the 2008 highway plans, the South Branch Parkway would cost the state more than $2.2 million (equivalent to $ in ) in funds to put together the survey of lands in the proposed alignment. Some of these funds for the survey were originally intended to go towards the removal of the Flemington Circle.

<text>John Q. is a 2002 American thriller drama film written by James Kearns and directed by Nick Cassavetes. It stars Denzel Washington as the title character, a man who takes a hospital emergency room hostage in order for his son to receive a heart transplant. Robert Duvall, James Woods, Anne Heche, Kimberly Elise, and Ray Liotta appear in supporting roles.

The film was shot in Toronto, Hamilton, Ontario, and Canmore, Alberta, although the story takes place in Chicago. Shooting took place from August 8 to November 3, 2000, and the film was released on February 15, 2002. It received generally negative reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $102 million on a $36 million budget.

== Plot ==

A young woman in a white BMW 5 Series drives recklessly on a mountainous winding road; she collides with a truck and is killed instantly.

Weeks earlier in Chicago, factory worker John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise rush their young son Michael to the hospital after he collapses at his baseball game. Cardiologist Dr. Raymond Turner and administrator Rebecca Payne tell John and Denise that Michael needs a heart transplant, at a cost of $250,000, or he will die.

However, the couple are behind on their house and car payments and have only $1,000 in savings, and the hospital requires a $75,000 down payment simply to place Michael on the organ transplant list. To make matters worse, John&#x27;s health insurance will not cover the surgery due to them changing his policy as a result of them switching insurance carriers and reducing his working hours.

The couple attempts to raise the money, but they exhaust all avenues and still come up short. Upon learning the hospital intends to send Michael home to die, in desperation, John takes Dr. Turner and several patients and staff hostage at gunpoint in the ER, demanding that Payne put Michael&#x27;s name on the transplant list. Police negotiator Lt. Frank Grimes makes contact with John.

Grimes clashes with his superior Chief Gus Monroe over the handling of the siege. Most of the hostages sympathize with John and reflect on the flaws of America&#x27;s healthcare system. A nurse even reveals that Michael&#x27;s condition could have been detected earlier during routine checkups, but the doctor had not recommended additional testing, to get bonuses from the insurance company in exchange for helping maintain their profit.

After agreeing to release some of the patients, John is attacked by hostage Mitch, but Mitch&#x27;s abused girlfriend Julie helps subdue him. John releases expectant couple Steve and Miriam and immigrant mother Rosa with her infant son, who all declare their support for John to the news crews outside. Grimes and Payne tell Denise about John&#x27;s act. Payne places Michael on the list to perform the operation pro bono.

Overriding Grimes, Monroe has a SWAT sniper enter the ER via an air shaft, luring John into the line of fire with a call from Denise. John speaks with Michael as his condition worsens, while a news crew hacks the police surveillance feed and broadcasts John&#x27;s conversation with his family. John discovers the hacked news footage just as the sniper fires, wounding him in the shoulder.

John overpowers the sniper and uses him as a human shield as he reiterates his demands in front of a cheering crowd. As night falls, Michael is removed from the ICU and brought to the ER in exchange for the sniper&#x27;s release, while Denise waits at the police command post along with her and John&#x27;s friends Jimmy and Gina Palumbo.

John reveals his intention to die by suicide so that Michael can have his heart. He also reveals that his gun was empty all along. He persuades Turner to perform the operation, and Julie and security guard Max bear witness to John&#x27;s impromptu will. He says his goodbyes to Michael, and prepares to end his own life using the only bullet he brought, when Denise brings news that the heart of a recently deceased organ donor – the woman who drove the BMW – is on the way.

Once the heart arrives, John releases the hostages, including patient Lester, who surrenders to police posing as John. John, posing as a surgeon, accompanies Michael to the operating room where Grimes, who noticed the switch, allows him to watch Michael&#x27;s operation before arresting him.

Three months later, John&#x27;s actions have sparked national debate about healthcare, and in court his family, friends and all the hostages testify on his behalf at trial. John is acquitted of attempted murder and armed criminal action, but convicted of kidnapping and false imprisonment. His lawyer assures him that he will likely serve no more than two years.

As John is escorted from the courthouse, Lester proclaims him as a hero, and a now-healthy Michael makes eye contact with John, thanking John for saving his life.

==Cast==
==Production==
According to the commentary on the deleted scenes with Nick Cassavetes and writer James Kearns, the main theme of the movie was said to be &quot;about a miracle and John&#x27;s faith in God creating the miracle&quot;. They also mentioned how SWAT team advisors for the film related a similar true incident in Toronto, where a man (Henry Masuka) took an ER hostage after it would not provide immediate service to his infant son on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999. When he exited the ER, he was shot and killed and found to be carrying an unloaded pellet gun.

==Release==
&quot;John Q.&quot; opened in first place, grossing $20.2 million during its first weekend. It ended up with a total domestic gross of $71 million and $102.2 million worldwide.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;John Q.&quot; holds an approval rating of 25% based on the 133 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Washington&#x27;s performance rises above the material, but &quot;John Q&quot; pounds the audience over the head with its message.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 30 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale. The film also raised fear in the healthcare industry of copycat incidents by disgruntled patients 

==Legacy==
After the killing of Brian Thompson, this film was mentioned in a number of articles about the incident.

==Remake==
The film was officially remade in India as the Hindi-language 2006 film &quot;Tathastu&quot;, in Kannada as &quot;Sugreeva&quot; and Tamil-language 2023 film &quot;Tamilarasan&quot;.

<text>Route 32 is an arterial state highway in Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States. The route is a highway along Forsgate Drive that connects U.S. Route 130 (US 130) in South Brunswick Township and the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95, I-95) at exit 8A in Monroe Township. Despite the short length, it is an important artery that connects not only traffic between the Turnpike and US 130, but traffic to County Route 535 (CR 535). The right-of-way on Forsgate continues eastward as County Route 612 (CR 612). Route 32 was first designated in 1964 along Forsgate Drive and was proposed to become part of Route 92 along its entire alignment.

== Route description ==

Route 32 begins at a partial interchange with US 130 in South Brunswick Township. The route heads eastward, running along access ramps from US 130 and the local park and ride serving Coach USA buses to New York City. Heading onto the mainline Route 32, the highway receives the moniker of Forsgate Drive. Intersecting with a U-turn ramp from the westbound lanes, the highway serves the area as a four-lane industrial arterial. Route 32 heads further east, passing through industrial areas and local commercial headquarters. A short distance later, the highway intersects with Herrod Drive and Commerce Drive, both of which serve the local industry. Forsgate Drive continues eastward as the arterial, intersecting with CR 535 (Cranbury–South River Road). From here, Route 32 enters Monroe Township and begins serving enterchange 8A on the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). A partial trumpet interchange, exit 8A serves access to CR 535 (for drivers heading to Route 32 westbound) and Route 32 eastbound. After serving another local industry, Route 32 crosses over the four-sectioned mainline of the turnpike, where the designation ends. The road continues east as CR 612.
== History ==
The alignment of Route 32 was first designated in 1964, when the state took over jurisdiction of a highway from US 130 in South Brunswick, eastward along Forsgate Drive to the intersection with CR 522 and CR 535 in Monroe Township. Exit 8A originally ended at a T-intersection with Route 32 which was modified to a trumpet interchange after 1987. This originally featured an exit ramp from the tollgate to Route 32 west, which was later changed due to heavy congestion at the ramp. The turnpike ramp to Route 32 westbound was closed off but leaving most of the old pavement in place, creating a stub ramp. In its place, a new, two-lane ramp to CR 535 was built. Motorists must now take CR 535 south to access Route 32 westbound.
Route 32&#x27;s alignment from US 130 to the turnpike was also designated to become an alignment of Route 92, a tolled extension of the New Jersey Turnpike. Route 32 and nearby Friendship Road were to be supplanted by Route 92, using exit 8A on the turnpike for the eastern terminus. However, after years of struggle to get the toll route built, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority canceled the Route 92 project on December 1, 2006.

==Future==
Due to congestion from exit 8A on the turnpike, the turnpike authority is proposing a project to improve traffic congestion along Route 32 called the &quot;Interchange 8A to Route 130 Connection&quot;. The project would start from US 130 in South Brunswick and end at interchange 8A in Monroe. Plans and dates have yet to be determined.

<text>Heinrich Kiepert (July 31, 1818 – April 21, 1899) was a German geographer.

==Early life and education==

Kiepert was born in Berlin. He traveled frequently as a youth with his family and documented his travels by drawing. His family was friends with Leopold von Ranke, who inspired Kiepert&#x27;s creative endeavors. Kiepert was taught by August Meineke in school. Meineke influenced Kiepert&#x27;s interest in classical antiquity. He attended Humboldt University of Berlin. He studied history, philology, and geography.

==Cartography career==

He published his first geographical work, with Carl Ritter, in 1840, titled &quot;Atlas von Hellas und den hellenischen Kolonien&quot;. The atlas focused on ancient Greece. In 1841, he drew the maps which appeared in a groundbreaking book on the Mideast, &quot;Biblical Researches in Palestine&quot;, written by Edward Robinson. In 1848 his &quot;Historisch-geographischer Atlas der alten Welt&quot; was published. In 1854, his atlas, &quot;Atlas antiquus&quot; was released. It was translated into five languages. &quot;Neuer Handatlas über alle Teile der Erde&quot; was first published in 1855. In 1877 his &quot;Lehrbuch der alten Geographie&quot; was published, and in 1879 &quot;Leitfaden der alten Geographie&quot;, which was translated into English (&quot;A Manual of Ancient Geography&quot;, 1881) and into French. In 1894 he created the first part of a larger atlas of the ancient world titled &quot;Formae orbis antiqui&quot;. He traveled to Asia Minor four times between 1841 and 1848. He created two maps of the region, including &quot;Karte des osmanischen Reiches in Asien&quot;, in 1844. Furthermore, he made some maps for the Baedeker publishing, mainly for their Egypt and Palestine outstanding guides but also for some of Europe (Paris, London, South Italy, etc.): &quot;Italie du Sud et la Sicile. Avec excursions aux îles de Lipari, à Tunis, à Malte, en Sardaigne et à Athènes&quot; (3rd ed., 1872), &quot;London nebst Ausflügen nach Süd-England, Wales u. Schottland, sowie Reiserouten vom Continent nach England&quot; (5th ed., 1875); and &quot;Paris ses environs et les principaux itinéraires des pays limitrophes à Paris&quot; (3rd ed., 1874).

Kiepert taught geography at the University of Humboldt-Berlin starting in 1854. He taught at the university until his death.

==Death and legacy==

He died in Berlin on April 21, 1899. His son, cartographer Richard Kiepert published remaining works by Kiepert after his death, including a map of Asia Minor in 24 sheets on a scale of 1:400,000 in 1902. He also managed the reissuing of &quot;Formae orbis antiqui&quot;. Kiepert Island is named after Kiepert.

<text>Route 33 is a state highway in the central part of the US state of New Jersey. The highway extends , from an interchange with U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Trenton, Mercer County, east to an intersection of Main Street (Route 71) in Neptune, Monmouth County. Route 33 is a major route through Central New Jersey, as it runs from the greater state capital area in the Delaware Valley Region, through a mixture of farmland, housing, and commercial developments in the lower Raritan Valley Region, en route to the greater Asbury Park area on the Jersey Shore. The route traverses through historic towns such as Hightstown, Monroe Township, Manalapan, Freehold, and Tinton Falls. There are several intersections on Route 33 with future developments.

Route 33 begins in Trenton as a two-lane residential street. It passes through central Mercer County, joining northbound US 130 in Robbinsville. It leaves the U.S. Highway in East Windsor and becomes a local town road into the borough of Hightstown. It turns east again as it passes the east end of the Route 133, where it becomes an arterial road with four lanes as it makes its way through Monmouth County toward the shore. Around the greater &quot;Freeholds area&quot;, it becomes a freeway. It then crosses the Garden State Parkway&#x27;s exit 100 in Tinton Falls and Route 18 in Neptune. Here, it is locally known as Corlies Avenue. Route 33 ends at Route 71 in Neptune. It has two concurrencies along the route, one with Route 34 and the second with US 130. It roughly parallels Interstate 195 (I-195), located further to the south.

==Route description==

Route 33 begins at an interchange with US 1 in the state capital of Trenton, Mercer County; the interchange also includes a ramp from westbound Route 33 to southbound Route 129 at that route&#x27;s northern terminus at a partial interchange with US 1. The route heads southeast on Market Street as a four-lane divided highway, passing over NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line and Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor railroad line, just south of the Trenton Transit Center serving Amtrak, NJ Transit&#x27;s Northeast Corridor Line and River Line, and SEPTA&#x27;s Trenton Line. After intersecting with South Clinton Avenue, Route 33 becomes Greenwood Avenue and heads east as a two-lane residential street on the east side of the city, passing north of Trenton Central High School and serving a few small businesses. Greenwood Avenue then enters Hamilton and enters a slightly more commercialized area before passing north of a cemetery. At this point, Greenwood Avenue ends, and Route 33 merges with Nottingham Way and becomes a four-lane boulevard lined with many homes and businesses. After reaching a modified interchange with I-295, Route 33 turns right off of Nottingham Way and becomes a two-lane surface road with a center left-turn lane. The route passes many business and crosses through a wooded residential area before coming back into a commercial area and entering Robbinsville, where Route 33 turns northeast onto US 130 and the two routes run concurrently on a four-lane arterial road.

US 130/Route 33 passes through a wooded area with several business lining the route before entering East Windsor, where Route 33 splits off from US 130 onto two-lane Mercer Street while US 130 continues north-northeast. The road passes through woods before emerging into Hightstown, where it serves several businesses and bisects a cemetery before entering the downtown area. Here, Mercer Street ends, and Route 33 runs northeast along Main Street before turning right onto Franklin Street and coming back into East Windsor. The route becomes a four-lane arterial road as it passes under the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) and becomes a divided highway, reaching an interchange with Route 133, which serves the turnpike.
After the intersection of Twin Rivers Drive/Twin Rivers Drive North, Route 33 enters Monroe Township, Middlesex County, where it serves many residential communities. Continuing east, activity along the sides of the highway disappears, and the route enters Millstone Township, Monmouth County, where businesses begin to reappear. Crossing into Manalapan, Route 33 passes through a mix of farmland and commercial areas before reaching the western terminus of Bus. Route 33, an old alignment of Route 33. At this point, Route 33 becomes a four-lane freeway and enters Freehold Township. The freeway passes south of Freehold Raceway Mall and bypasses Freehold, reaching interchanges with CR 537 and US 9 at the southern terminus of Route 79. Heading into more rural areas, Route 33 becomes a two-lane freeway and enters Howell and passes over the Freehold Industrial Track railroad line operated by the Delaware and Raritan River Railroad before it meets the eastern terminus of Bus. Route 33 as the freeway ends.
Now a two-lane surface road, Route 33 passes through a largely wooded area south of Naval Weapons Station Earle and serves several businesses and residential neighborhoods before merging with Route 34 and becoming a four-lane arterial road. The two routes run concurrently and pass over the Southern Secondary railroad line operated by the Delaware and Raritan River Railroad before entering Wall Township, where several businesses line the route. At Collingwood Circle, Route 34 splits from Route 33, and the latter continues east as a four-lane undivided surface road while Route 34 continues southeast and enters Tinton Falls. The westbound and eastbound lanes eventually split apart as the highway reaches the western terminus of Route 66 and an interchange with the Garden State Parkway. Past this point, Route 33 becomes Corlies Avenue and enters Neptune, passing through many residential neighborhoods. After an interchange with Route 18, Route 33 forms the border between Neptune to the north and Neptune City to the south. The road then crosses entirely back into Neptune and passes south of Jersey Shore University Medical Center and K. Hovnanian Children&#x27;s Hospital. After an intersection of Route 35, Route 33 becomes to a two-lane surface road with a center left-turn lane before crossing NJ Transit&#x27;s North Jersey Coast Line and reaching its eastern terminus at the intersection of Main Street Route 71.

==History==

West of Robbinsville, the road was maintained by the Trenton and Allentown Turnpike, which was chartered in 1856; east of Robbinsville, the turnpike followed modern-day CR 526 to Allentown. From the border of Manalapan and Millstone townships east to the intersection with Woodward Road, the road was maintained by the Manalapan and Patton&#x27;s Corner Turnpike; the road from there to Freehold was maintained as the Freehold and Manalapan Turnpike, chartered in 1858. The Freehold and Manalapan bought the portion of the Manalapan and Patton&#x27;s Corner now signed Route 33. In addition, a small portion of the Englishtown and Millstone Turnpike was built along Route 33 from CR 527A west to Millstone Road, though this was overtaken in the construction of the Freehold and Manalapan Turnpike, chartered in 1866 to connect Freehold and Manalapan. From Freehold to Jerseyville, what is now Bus. Route 33 was maintained by the Freehold and Jerseyville Turnpike, chartered in 1866.

Route 33 originally was part of two auto trails: the Cranbury Trail, an alternative to the Lincoln Trail running from New Brunswick to Trenton; and the Jersey Link, running from Hightstown to Ocean Grove. These routes were incorporated in 1916 into two new routes: Route 1 in parts of the road south of Hightstown, and Route 7 from Hightstown to its terminus at Route 71. Both roads were changed into Route 33 in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering.

Route 33 was originally planned as a freeway from US 1 in Trenton across New Jersey to Route 18 in Neptune. However, in 1967, the New Jersey Department of Transportation scaled back proposals to the current Route 33. Route 33 from near CR 527 in Manalapan to Halls Mill Road in Freehold Township was completed and opened in segments from 1971 to 1988.

Route 33 has three abandoned segments. The first of these is the cloverleaf ramp from Route 79 southbound to Route 33 eastbound. It has been mostly demolished to make way for a new reverse jughandle for US 9 northbound to Schanck Road. The merging part of the ramp still remains abandoned along the right side of the eastbound freeway.

The original alignment for the freeway east of Halls Mill Road (CR 55) can be seen now as a New Jersey Department of Transportation maintenance shed. The new alignment curves to the left after the interchange, in order to avoid what the New Jersey Department of Transportation believed to be a suspected (but never identified) turtle bog habitat. The pavement is accessible from the eastbound on-ramp, but is fenced off.

Up until late 1988, Route 33 westbound ran underneath US 130, then merged with US 130&#x27;s southbound lanes. This was because Route 33 ran parallel to Pennsylvania Railroad Camden &amp; Amboy route at that point, requiring a massive concrete overpass. (Route 33 eastbound also ascended the bridge approach about halfway before branching off like an exit ramp—a sign with flashing lights read &quot;Hightstown, Shore Points&quot; at the fork.) Pennsylvania Railroad abandoned the Hightstown–Windsor segment in 1967, reducing the importance of the hulking bridge. The New Jersey Department of Transportation eventually demolished the crumbling structure in 1989. Route 33 now meets US 130 at the north end of the overlap with a traffic signal.

In 2001, the Freehold Bypass was designated as the Theodore J. Narozanick Highway.

The remainder of Route 33 east to Fairfield Road/Brickyard Road in Howell was not completed until 2003. The project cost $33.7 million in 2003 (equivalent to $ in ).

Until 2003, the intersection of US 130/Route 33 in Robbinsville was configured as an at-grade wye interchange, employing curved ramps for the directional movements. The junction has since been modified to a signalized intersection with ordinary turning lanes.
The eastbound Howell road exit ramp, which began construction in 2003, was found to be erroneously placed, possibly confusing drivers on Howell Road. An attempt was made to realign the ramp, though this failed, and the exit was abandoned shortly after, and is still inaccessible and rarely maintained. Because of this, the ramp has since remains barricaded off, slowly decaying.

A bridge once carried Route 33 over the same Pennsylvania Railroad (now Conrail Shared Assets Operations) line further south in Robbinsville. The New Jersey Department of Transportation replaced the overpass with a wider, linear roadway in 2009. As the Conrail Shared Assets Operations line was dormant, no railroad street crossing was installed. Trackage was dismantled two years later in 2011 in between Robbinsville and East Windsor.

The interchange with US 130 was rebuilt from a T-intersection to a four-way in 2009, with the construction of a new road on the southeast side of US 130.

On December 31, 2006, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority released its proposals regarding exit 8 on the New Jersey Turnpike. The old exit 8 was to be demolished and replaced with a new interchange. The new exit 8 would end at the intersection with Route 33, Milford Road, and Route 133 (on the east side of the expressway, instead of the west). This new exit 8 would grant direct access to the bypass (without going through any traffic lights), as well as to Route 33, using grade-separated interchanges. The new toll gate was to feature a total of 10 lanes at the new facility. The new interchange opened in January 2013.

==Major intersections==












==Business route==
Route 33 Business (Route 33 Bus.) is a short state highway in New Jersey that was the original alignment of Route 33 before a freeway was built as a bypass of Freehold. This business route stretches through Manalapan, Freehold Township, Freehold, and Howell. The highway holds the distinction of being the only business route state highway in all of New Jersey.
Business Route 33 begins at the interchange with Route 33, its parent route, in Manalapan. A short distance after, the interchange from Route 33 eastbound merges into Business Route 33, and the route passes to the south of Monmouth Battlefield State Park and enters Freehold Township. Business Route 33 intersects with US 9, becoming Park Avenue. Business Route 33 turns to the southeast and enters Freehold, passing to the north of the Freehold Raceway and intersects with West Main Street (CR 537). A short distance later, Business Route 33 intersects at a traffic light with South Street (Route 79) in Downtown Freehold. After the intersection of South Street (Route 79), it crosses back into Freehold Township. Farther east, the route passes over the Freehold Industrial Track railroad line operated by the Delaware &amp; Raritan River Railroad and interchanges with Halls Mill Road/Kozloski Road (CR 55). After the interchange with Halls Mill Road/Kozloski Road (CR 55), Business Route 33 enters Howell. At the intersection of Fairfield Road/Brickyard Road, Business Route 33 enters the interchange with Route 33 and the freeway, where the designation terminates.

Business Route 33 originates as an alignment of Route 33, designated across the state in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering as a replacement to Route 1 and Route 7, which were assigned in the 1920s. The route remained intact for several decades, continuing as the proposals for the crosstown Route 33 Freeway during the 1960s were drawn up. The new Route 33 was to be long, starting at US 1 in Trenton, crossing through Princeton and into Hightstown, where it would connect with the current-day Route 133, heading eastward, where it would connect with the unbuilt Driscoll Expressway in Freehold. The freeway would continue, meeting the Garden State Parkway near exit 100 in Neptune and terminate at Route 18 in Neptune. However, the next year, the New Jersey Department of Transportation had to scale down the project to a new bypass of Freehold, and prevent the congestion of traffic through the borough. Design studies began that year, and the entire bypass was constructed during the 1970s and 1980s, with most of the freeway finished in 1988. This new bypass was designated as Route 33 Bypass from 1965 until Route 33 was re-aligned off the local roads onto the new freeway in 1990, which at that time, Route 33 Bus. was designated on the former alignment.
